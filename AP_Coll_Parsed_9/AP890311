a judge ruled that a policeman committed no crime 
when he shot a street carwindow washer to death last august but he 
said the officer abused his authority and failed to control himself 
county judge morton perry cleared officer efrain grillo after a 
twoday factfinding inquest used in investigations of police 
officers 
i am on the record here and now as saying this officer used 
poor judgment perry said if there are many more like him 
around id be very concerned 
grillo is currently relieved of duty for allegedly fondling a 
prostitute in september in an unrelated incident 
on thursday perry said there was insufficient evidence to 
disprove grillos account of the shooting of larry davis a homeless 
man who earned small change by washing car windows in traffic 
grillo who had arrested davis earlier in the day but found him 
back at the same windowwashing spot later said the two argued and 
davis lunged at him with a knife 
one witness turner williams who also washes windows claimed 
the knife belonged to grillo not davis

the federal aviation administration has received 
59 reports of miswiring or faulty plumbing in cargohold and engine 
firesuppression systems of boeing commercial jets since 1981 
officials said 
faa officials said 32 of the problems were found by airlines 
between march 1988 and jan 31 when the agency issued an 
airworthiness directive ordering checks of all boeing aircraft built 
since dec 31 1980 and flown by us operators covering 741 
planes in all 
the other 27 problems have been found since jan 31 the latest 
on thursday 
none of the discrepancies directly affected the airworthiness of 
the aircraft the faa said in a news release friday but the agency 
said flight crews could have been misled into taking the wrong 
action during an inflight engine or cargo compartment fire 
all of the problems were corrected before the planes were 
returned to service the faa said 
of the 27 problems found since the jan 31 order six were on 
us aircraft and 21 on foreign planes 
eleven of the problems were in engine fire warning and 
suppression systems five on 737300s and 737400s three in 767s 
two in 757s and one in a 747 sixteen problems were found in cargo 
compartment fire warning and suppression systems 13 in 747s and 
three in 767s 
boeing co said it is redesigning some parts and overhauling test 
procedures to try to prevent future errors 
meanwhile a letter dated jan 26 from leroy keith local manager 
of the faas aircraft certification service to boeing officials 
renewed concerns about delays in reporting safety problems to the 
federal agency the seattle postintelligencer reported friday 
boeing learned of crossed wires in a 757 cargo firesuppression 
system last august but reported the problem four months later keith 
noted 
until now i had been encouraged that there were definite 
improvements his letter said the 757 issue however indicates 
that more needs to be done

the mother of an elementary school pupil has 
ruled out the barbershop for her son even though he was suspended 
because of what school officials contend is a martini glass design 
shaved on his scalp 
the school principal said thursday the hair design which the 
mother contends is an hourglass encourages alcohol abuse 
my son has missed three weeks of school because of a haircut 
said debra muhammad whose 11yearold son isaiah attends robert 
e lee elementary school ive never heard of anything like this 
in my life i could see if he was a troublemaker but for a 
haircut 
mrs muhammad said isaiahs older brother has the same hourglass 
design carved in his hair 
principal gregory muzik said all the youngster has to do to get 
reinstated is get a haircut im not saying the child is out of 
school forever he said there has to be some willingness to 
cooperate 
hair carvings have become popular among students muzik said 
most designs depict the name of sports heroes or somebodys initials 
and are no problem but any design that seems to encourage drug or 
alcohol abuse or satanism is prohibited the principal said 
only one other lee pupil has run afoul of the rule muzik said 
and that boys parents promptly took him to a barbershop but mrs 
muhammad said a haircut for isaiah is out of the question 
its the principle she said other kids have the same 
haircut but he has been singled out 
isaiah was suspended under the richmond school divisions 
standards of student conduct which give principals wide latitude in 
enforcing rules on appearance muzik said it bars students from 
immodest unhealthful or distracting appearance 
muzik conceded the design in the boys hair could be subject to 
interpretation and said it is unlikely an 11yearold even knows 
what a martini is but in his view and that of two teachers at the 
school it is a martini glass 
its clearly alcoholrelated muzik said a strong stand 
has to be taken its a significant enough problem

bloody separatist rioting more protests had been expected friday 
the anniversary of the 1959 uprising against chinese rule 
chinas official media said calm had returned to the city of 
70000 and quoted lhasa residents as expressing gratitude for the 
military intervention 
the xinhua news agency quoted a tibetan scholar as saying 
tibetans have a deep hatred for the rioters it depicted 
tibetans offering water straw mattresses tea and shelter to 
chinese troops 
tibetans contacted by telephone however spoke of police 
roundups and a climate of fear they spoke of heavy military 
presence on the streets and said they had been told to remain 
indoors 
one woman said largescale arrests began after most foreigners 
left the city thursday the nightly news friday said more than 30 
rioters had surrendered to police 
foreign tourists were told to leave lhasa when martial law was

noticed some policemen were standing on the roof of another nearby 
house we heard shots 
policemen later stopped them at their hotel and took their film 
and their passports they reported 
we heard shots said one of the swedes who identified 
himself only as pontus the shots fired by the soldiers when i 
looked out from the window you can see a warlike scene once in a

gen andres rodriguez who seized power 
in a coup that ousted president alfredo stroessner says he has 
agreed to be the presidential nominee of the governing colorado 
party 
the elections are set for may 1 
at no moment was i inspired by inferior motives or a hunger for 
power rodriguez said friday my decision was inspired only in 
the happiness of my country and the wellbeing of all my fellow 
citizens 
rodriguez said that if elected he will work within an 
exemplary multiparty system to carry out constitutional reforms 
that would give paraguay a respected image 
opposition politicians have called for elimination of a clause in 
the constitution that allows a president to continually seek 
reelection 
they also want anulled a 1970 criminal law called the defense 
of public peace that was widely used under stroessner to harass 
dissidents for allegedly doing such things as inspiring class 
hatred among paraguayans 
the nomination was no surprise said domingo laino president 
of the authentic radical liberal party paraguays largest 
opposition group 
since the 1940s the colorado party has been nominating 
generals for the presidency they seem unable to separate themselves 
from men in uniform 
rodriguez a 65yearold cavalry general organized the feb 3 
coup that ended stroessners 34 years in power 
meanwhile former interior minister sabino augusto montanaro left 
paraguay for political asylum in honduras montanaro 66 was given 
refuge in the honduran embassy in asuncion the day of the coup a 
telephoned bomb threat delayed his flight for two hours on friday 
montanaro was one of stroessners most trusted aides and 
president of the colorado party 
he was one of five ministers and seven high government and party 
officials accused of crimes against public administration after 
the coup

former national security adviser robert 
mcfarlane says he was unaware of many of oliver norths activities 
for the contras but thought the efforts of a single military officer 
would be inconsequential 
testifying friday in norths trial on charges stemming from the 
irancontra affair mcfarlane said he didnt know how his former 
aide had become involved in private fundraising for the contras or 
was determining how private contributions were being spent 
mcfarlane also said he hadnt known that north had used a public 
relations consultant to get a quick 30000 donation for the contras 
earlier mcfarlane said former president reagan knew in 1984 that 
arrangements had been made to get 1 million a month from saudi 
arabia for the the usbacked rebels in nicaragua 
and reagan said well all be hanging by our thumbs if word 
got out that mcfarlane or other administration officials were 
seeking help from abroad at a time that congress had forbidden 
direct us aid to the contras according to minutes of the 1984 
meeting read into the court record 
despite a series of memos from north to mcfarlane between 
december 1984 and may 1985 mcfarlane said he didnt know specifics 
of norths activities such as his help in directing the contras in 
opening of another front in nicaragua 
i had been in the military for 20 years and i knew the 
activities of a single officer in setting up a southern front was 
inconsequential said mcfarlane like north a former marine it 
didnt occur to me that north could set up a southern front 
in the late summer and fall of 1985 two congressional panels 
began asking about news reports of norths involvement with the 
contras four of norths 12 criminal charges say he prepared 
responses for mcfarlanes signature essentially denying that north 
was doing anything for the guerrilla force 
mcfarlane has pleaded guilty to four charges of withholding 
information from congress and was sentenced last week to two years 
probation 200 hours of community service and fines of 20000 
a march 5 1985 memo from north to mcfarlane says guatemala 
should get extra us aid because guatemalan officials supplied 
phony certificates that permitted a clandestine arms shipment to go 
to the contras 
i didnt even look at the certificates at the time said 
mcfarlane saying they were one of 10000 documents that crossed 
his desk 
mcfarlane said that there was a relation between the 
certificates and the suggestion for additional aid although the 
extra aid stood on the merits but the fact they helped the 
freedom fighters certainly didnt disqualify them from getting 
additional assistance mcfarlane said 
the request for extra aid went to top cabinet officials and the 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff without mentioning that phony 
enduser certificates had been provided 
the enduser certificates state that a country such as 
guatemala is the ultimate destination of arms 
a march 16 1985 memo suggests having a taxexempt charitable 
organization collect private donations that would be used to aid the 
contras a move that would be illegal 
mcfarlane acknowledged that a taxexempt organization cannot 
raise money for military items for use in a foreign country but 
said that even the president suggested that a time or two 
in response to a dec 4 1984 memo from north mcfarlane refused 
to authorize having the us government let the government of taiwan 
know that the united states supported that nation making a 
contribution to the contras 
i thought the problem was our seeking military help from 
another country mcfarlane testified 
north is accused of lying during congressional and presidential 
inquiries into the irancontra affair

sixteen areas of the country registered their 
highest readings of ozone smog this decade in 1988 according to a 
survey by a private research group 
another 15 areas cities and rural locations had their highest 
ozone smog readings of the past five years said the study released 
friday by th us public interest research group 
the organization is a selfstyled national nonpartisan research 
and lobbying group on consumer and environmental issues financed by 
citizen contributions 
in another indication of worsening air across the country the 
report found that smog levels in 32 cities exceeded federal safety 
limits 10 or more days last year 
thirteen of the 32 cities had 20 or more days of extremely 
unhealthy air by exceeding the federal limits 
today 19 years after congress set the national goal of safe 
healthy air quality we are faced with a situation in which an 
estimated 96 areas in which 150 million people live are too 
polluted to meet one or more of the air quality standards the 
report said 
the report used state government information to collect data on 
ozone in 67 areas cities or rural areas and data on carbon 
monoxide from 21 areas significant amounts of either gas results in 
unhealthy air 
ozone the primary component of smog is a gas formed when two 
other pollutants hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides combine in the 
presence of sunlight carbon monoxide is a colorless odorless and 
poisonous gas produced by incomplete combustion of carbon 
in looking back to 1980 the study found that in 31 areas surveyed 
the peak level of ozone smog in 1988 was higher than it had been 
in five years 
in 16 of those areas the peak level of the ozone smog in 1988 
was higher than it had been in any year of the decade the report 
said 
the study noted an improvement in carbon monoxide in 1983 the 
study found at least 10 cities exceeded the federal safety limit 
five or more days in 1987 however only six cities were in that 
category 
the report said the air can be made cleaner with tighter auto 
tailpipe standards mandatory cleanup steps for cities and severe 
pollution penalties for areas that do not meet air quality standards

the bush administration has shifted gears and 
put forward a new plan to deal with latin americas debt crisis 
one that envisions major reductions in the billiondollar debt 
burden 
the proposal unveiled friday by treasury secretary nicholas 
brady before an audience of international bankers members of 
congress and leaders of international lending institutions is 
getting generally positive reviews 
brady called for a great cooperative effort among all nations 
to solve the 7yearold crisis 
our objective is to rekindle the hope of the people and leaders 
of debtor nations that their sacrifices will lead to greater 
prosperity in the present and the prospect of a future unclouded by 
the burden of debt brady said 
the plan marks a shift from reagan administration policy under 
the socalled baker plan which opposed writing off the 
obligations of the debtor nations the plan devised in 1985 by 
thentreasury secretary james a baker iii now secretary of state 
suggested a voluntary increase in loans by the commercial banks in 
return for basic economic reforms by the debtor nations 
instead the new proposal endorses voluntary efforts on the part 
of commercial banks to forgive part of the 400 billion they are 
owed by the largest debtor countries such as mexico venezuela and 
brazil 
and to encourage the banks to forgive portions of the debt the 
administration is calling on the 151nation world bank and its 
sister organization the international monetary fund to help 
provide guarantees for the remaining debt owed by the poor countries 
a frequent critic of the reagan policy sen bill bradley 
dnj termed the new proposal a significant change of 
direction 
he warned however that it would have no chance of success 
unless the administration created a special post of debt 
ambassador 
michel camdessus managing director of the imf praised bradys 
initiative as timely and welcome 
camdessus said he looked forward to working with brady to 
implement the plan and urged other countries to give it a 
positive response 
the secretary is correct to emphasize the importance of 
continued economic reforms in the debtor countries and the need 
for further loans to the third world and a reduction in their debt 
camdessus said 
he said banks should be more flexible in their treatment of the 
problem 
foreign reaction was also generally favorable with japanese 
finance minister tatsuo murayama telling reporters in japan that the 
his government welcomed the bush initiative and pledged an 
unspecified amount of financial backing 
the united states is counting on japan to recycle a portion of 
its huge trade surpluses into support for third world countries 
president bush had asked brady to review the former 
administrations debt policy 
last weeks riots in venezuela one of the most politically 
stable democracies in latin america added some urgency to the 
review 
more than 300 people were killed in disturbances that erupted 
after the government announced new austerity measures aimed at 
satisfying international creditors 
the morgan guaranty trust co estimates that the foreign debt of 
the 15 principal borrowers including 10 latin american countries 
rose to 505 billion last year with interest the countries had to 
pay totaling 42 billion 
the debt owed by all third world countries totaled 132 trillion 
at the end of 1988 up from 800 billion in 1982 the year the debt 
crisis first erupted with the announcement by mexico that it could 
not meet its obligations 
the largest debtor country is brazil with 110 billion owed 
followed by mexico with 107 billion owed other big debtors are 
argentina 50 billion and venezuela 33 billion

district of columbia delegate walter fauntroy 
could become the first congressman investigated by a special 
prosecutor if attorney general dick thornburgh approves 
the justice departments criminal division on friday asked 
thornburgh to appoint an independent counsel to investigate a 
possible payrollpadding scheme involving fauntroy the districts 
nonvoting delegate to the house 
the request came after a threemonth fbi investigation into 
allegations that thomas john savage the son of rep gus savage 
dill did little or no work in fellow democrat fauntroys office 
david runkel a spokesman for thornburgh said the request had 
been submitted but the attorney general had not yet reviewed the 
report runkel added that he did not know when thornburgh would 
decide on the case 
the appointment would be authorized under an order issued last 
august by thenattorney general edwin meese iii setting up the 
procedure to deal with charges of wrongdoing against members of 
congress officials of the executive branch of the federal 
government can be subject to investigation by special prosecutors 
under a separate law and meese himself was twice investigated by 
independent counsels 
in the fauntroy case savage earned 21398 while on fauntroys 
payroll between september 1987 and june 1988 during that time the 
younger savage also swore in notarized illinois election documents 
that he was living full time in chicago where he was running for a 
state house of representatives seat 
several law enforcement officials said that the focus of the 
investigation is possible violations of federal fraud laws 
sources familiar with the investigation and speaking on condition 
of anonymity told the associated press that fauntroy and his staff 
have refused to cooperate with the fbi 
we have concluded that there has to be an independent 
prosecutor simply because there are a number of unanswered questions 
out there and we have individuals who wont talk said a justice 
department source 
an independent prosecutor would have the power to subpoena 
fauntroy and his staff to testify before a grand jury about the 
younger savages whereabouts fbi agents conducting the preliminary 
investigation said they did not have the authority to ask for such 
subpoenas 
fauntroy said through a spokeswoman that he had not learned of 
the justice departments action while rep savage did not return 
repeated phone calls to his capitol hill office thomas savage when 
reached in chicago refused to comment 
investigators based their case around records which were also 
obtained by the associated press that suggest the younger savage was 
in chicago while he was on fauntroys payroll the sources said 
among those documents are notarized residency records and 
election petitions the younger savage filed with the illinois board 
of elections last year those records indicated that he was actually 
in chicago assisting his fathers reelection campaign and 
organizing his own run for office while he was on fauntroys office 
payroll the sources said 
if the case continues investigators likely will examine 
fauntroys office records for the past five years to determine 
whether other hiring irregularities have occurred said sources 
familiar with the case

john tower behind them swiftly praised president bushs selection of 
rep dick cheney of wyoming as defense secretary and said 
confirmation hearings would begin next week

and the no 2 republican leader in the house on friday calling him

armed services committee said confirmation hearings would begin next 
week

completed as expeditiously as possible consistent with the 
president and the nominee providing the requisite background and

reporters he ordered the fbi to speed up its background checks on 
cheney 
the announcement just 24 hours after the senate rejected tower in 
the sharply partisan struggle was surprising in its swiftness 
a spokesman for cheney said white house chief of staff john 
sununu called cheney before thursday afternoons tower vote and 
asked him to be at the white house for the roll call cheney got 
there after the vote and spoke with national security adviser brent 
scowcroft and sununu about being defense secretary said the 
spokesman pete williams 
bush formally offered him the post by telephone after an 
hourlong meeting friday afternoon at the white house williams said 
obviously things have moved very quickly in the last 24 
hours said cheney 48 i did agonize it was not an easy 
decision 
a former white house chief of staff under president ford cheney 
has been at the top of the party leadership in the house but has 
none of the direct defense background that tower had 
obviously there are areas that i need to know and ill have to 
work hard to master he told reporters 
rancor from the tower battle was still evident even as democrats 
lined up quickly to praise cheney and say bush had made a shrewd 
move with little stomach evident for another drawn out 
investigation 
this time it will be a confirmation not an execution said 
senate republican leader bob dole 
sen albert gore jr dtenn a member of the armed services 
committee said i know of no reason why it wouldnt be unanimous 
but i want to reserve judgment 
even amid the air of relief that cheney had been picked vice 
president dan quayle accused senate democrats of engaging in a 
mccarthyite mudslinging campaign against tower and waging an 
assault on the powers of the presidency 
bush said he hadnt read quayles remarks them so i cant tell 
you whether he speaks for me he said 
cheney said he underwent heart bypass surgery last august but 
returned to work three weeks later he said he had checked with his 
doctor before accepting bushs offer of the appointment and was 
assured his health posed no barrier 
cheneys selection leaves a vacuum in the republican leadership 
as minority whip cheney had been seen as the likely successor to 
house minority leader bob michel of illinois 
conservative rep newt gingrich of georgia is expected to compete 
for the republican whips position cheney will leave vacant

rep joseph p kennedy ii ended speculation he 
would run for massachusetts governor in 1990 saying he did not want 
to campaign while serving his congressional district and caring for 
his children 
kennedy 36 also announced friday he was separating from his 
wife sheilah and said it was a factor in the decision not to run 
the eldest son of the late robert f kennedy was considered the 
early frontrunner for the 1990 race to succeed massachusetts gov 
michael s dukakis 
kennedy left boston on friday for an undisclosed location to 
spend the weekend in seclusion with his 8yearold twins said chuck 
mcdermott the congressmans top aide and longtime friend 
this has been a very painful day for me and my family 
kennedy said in a prepared statement as a father my principle 
obligation and deepest personal desire is to assist my children 
through the most difficult time in their lives 
i also have a commitment to serve the people of the 8th 
congressional district therefore i feel it impossible at this time 
to take on the added burden of running for another office to end 
any further speculation i wish to make it clear that i do not 
intend to run for governor 
kennedy the first member of the latest generation of kennedys to 
enter politics instantly became a powerful fixture in massachusetts 
politics when in 1986 he won the house seat held by his uncle john 
f kennedy and later former house speaker thomas p oneill jr 
speculation about a gubernatorial run soared when dukakis the 
failed democratic presidential nominee announced in january that he 
would not seek a fourth term and boston mayor raymond flynn said he 
would not run for governor 
in a separate statement on his marriage kennedy said he and his 
wife decided to separate only after long and intense efforts to 
find another course 
kennedy married sheila brewster rauch a bankers daughter and 
philadelphia main line debutante on feb 3 1979 mrs kennedy 39 
a 1971 graduate of wheaton college met kennedy while she was doing 
graduate work at harvard university

republican whip second ranking republican in the house was 
nominated friday by president bush to be secretary of defense after

he said he had been back at work three weeks after the bypass 
operation and that he had skied at vail colo last christmas he 
said he checked with his cardiologist before accepting bushs offer

has no regrets about the tough decisions he made that may have cost 
him politically 
so many times my own conscience was different than what would 
say the majority conscience was said collins who is credited 
with helping the civil rights movement in the 1950s while governor 
in those times i stayed with my own conscience usually it 
brought me out fine 
several hundred people including collins wife of 57 years mary 
call and their children and grandchildren gathered friday at the 
florida state university law school commons to honor the former 
governor 
in 1957 collins vetoed a bill that would have given school 
boards the power to shut down schools rather than admit black 
children the veto was upheld by a slim margin

the government has for the first time set 
national hydrocarbon emission standards for gasoline 
in an attempt to head off an increasingly severe urban smog 
problem this summer the environmental protection agency announced 
friday that gasoline volatility levels in most parts of the country 
has been set at 105 pounds per inch gasoline volatility generally 
has been at at a level of 115 psi 
the volatility levels of auto fuel which are controlled during 
the blending process determine how easily gasoline evaporates and 
how much hydrocarbon pollutants get into the air 
hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides are key ingredients of ozone and 
urban smog 
the country had the worst urban smog problem in recent years last 
summer when federal maximum ozone levels were exceeded 60 percent 
more often than in 1983 the worst previous year

jury deliberations in the sky piracy trial of 
fawaz younis are set to resume monday to determine his fate on 
charges in connection with the hijacking of royal jordanian airlines 
flight in june 1985 
the judges instructions to the jury which met for four hours 
friday may have undercut the defendants argument that younis who 
witnesses identified as the leader in a group of four heavily armed 
men that stormed the plane acted as he did because he was a victim 
of the civil war that has engulfed lebanon since 1975 
orders to hijack a plane are illegal orders us 
district judge aubrey e robinson jr told jurors obedience to 
illegal orders is no defense said robinson emphasizing that only 
if younis did not know that hijacking was illegal should he be 
acquitted 
neither the two americans aboard the aircraft nor any of the 
other 70 passengers and crew members were injured in the incident 
which is viewed as a test of a 1984 longarm statute that 
asserts us jurisdiction over cases involving american hostages 
taken abroad

mexico city mexico applauded a bush administration proposal to 
help nations with crushing foreign debts but embattled venezuela 
called the proposal a too timid approach to a potentially 
explosive problem 
us treasury secretary nicholas brady on friday unveiled the 
proposal that endorses voluntary efforts by commercial banks to 
forgive part of the 410 billion they are owed by the largest debtor 
countries including brazil mexico and venezuela 
in so doing brady signalled that the bush administration intends 
to shed the 1985 baker plan promoted by thentreasury secretary 
james a baker iii that had favored new lending instead of debt 
forgiveness 
the government of mexican president carlos salinas de gortari 
which is trying to restructure payments on its 107 billion debt 
called bradys suggestions a first and positive response to 
mexicos position 
the change of emphasis that gives priority to the reduction of 
the debt and its servicing and not to further indebtedness as was 
the case in the past is particularly positive mexicos treasury 
department said in a statement 
salinas ordered mexican treasury secretary pedro aspe to 
washington on monday to take up the proposal with brady 
the argentine government said the proposal was a promising step 
forward and that it hoped followup developments are congruent 
with the expectations awakened by the plan 
president carlos andres perez of venezuela where rioting last 
week over government austerity measures spurred by the nations 
foreign debt left more than 300 dead had a lukewarm reaction 
i think the proposals are very timid and that they do not 
satisfy the minimum aspirations of latin america perez said 
however this opening will lead us to a dialogue with the 
administration of president bush that will result in a better 
understanding of the situation we are going through and our urgent 
needs perez added 
in brazil the third worlds largest debtor nation finance 
minister mailson da nobrega called reports of the new plan very 
positive 
but he warned the crushing debt continued to threaten political 
stability in latin america without decisive action from creditor 
countries populists and demagogues will arise to power da 
nobrega warned 
people will believe in messiahs radical groups will replace 
moderate ones he said 
the venezuelan riots were a clear alert that latin americas 
debt situation is socially and politically unbearable he added 
brazil which in 1985 returned to civilian government after 21 
years of military rule holds presidential elections on nov 15 the 
first popular vote since 1960 media polls show leftist leaders with 
high popularity 
latin american nations have spent 139 billion since 1984 to 
service the debt but with no appreciable reduction of indebtedness 
according to the latin american economic system a regional 
thinktank based in caracas venezuela 
to encourage the banks to forgive part of the debt the bush 
administration called on the world bank and the international 
monetary fund to help provide guarantees for the remaining debt owed 
by the poor countries 
emphasizing its initiative the administration late friday said 
it was extending a 450 million emergency loan for venezuela the 
shortterm financing is to be repaid when venezuela begins receiving 
new loans from the imf in april 
brazils planning ministry announced friday the world bank had 
offered brazil 1 billion for electric power development despite 
past objections to the countrys nuclear energy program 
in a joint communique the ministry and bank also said the bank 
had offered a special 2year aid program to help brazil meet the 
banks requirements for matching funds 
foreign credits are essential to brazils efforts to service its 
115 billion foreign debt each year brazil pays between 12 
billion and 14 billion on interest payments alone 
mexico paid 14 billion in interest and principal in 1988 and 
will pay another 16 billion this year latin americas other big 
debtors are argentina 50 billion and venezuela 33 billion

a un official says iran and iraq are 
making progress toward breaking their stalemate and agreeing on a 
permanent peace in their persian gulf war 
we may be on the right track said swedish un ambassador 
jan k eliasson the special un envoy to the gulf talks he would 
not discuss specific proposals that have been considered by the two 
sides 
eliasson met for two days last week with iranian diplomats led by 
a deputy foreign minister and held meetings wednesday and thursday 
with the iraqis led by un ambassador ismat kittani 
the talks are aimed at arranging a meeting between iranian 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati and his iraqi counterpart tariq 
aziz 
we discussed with the parties at length both matters of 
procedure and matters of substance and how we are now to best 
proceed to make progress eliasson told reporters 
i would say we are making some progress when it comes to 
defining the framework the shape of the talks and we hope this 
progress will continue and will be evident on the ministerial level 
the political level he said 
the iranian and iraqi foreign ministers were tentatively 
scheduled to meet in late march but eliasson indicated that 
deadline may not be met 
since the moslem month of daytime prayer and fasting ramadan 
begins in late march and lasts four weeks the talks could well be 
delayed until may 
velayati and aziz are to meet at an undisclosed location 
somewhere near un headquarters to resume the peace talks which 
deadlocked as soon as they began last aug 25 in geneva 
the talks broke down over iraqs demand that iran give up the 
right to search ships in international waters for war cargo bound 
for iraq tehran has not actually searched any ships since a 
unsponsored ceasefire took effect aug 20 
baghdad also insists that iran agree to a plan to have the united 
nations dredge the shatt alarab waterway iraqs only outlet to the 
sea 
tehran insists that the next step in the peace process must be a 
withdrawal of troops to their own territory iraq still holds about 
260 square miles of iranian territory 
tensions along their 740mile front line are becoming 
increasingly tense especially near an artificial lake iranian 
engineers created as a barrier near the shatt alarab 
shelling broke out near the water work on monday and tuesday 
according to the office of top un peacekeeper marrack goulding 
reports of the exchanges sent jitters through the oil markets

former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone who last 
month denied knowledge of a japanese companys controversial 
purchase of a usbuilt computer was aware of the sale more than 
three years ago reports said today 
nationallycirculated newspapers and televison news here said 
nakasone told a news conference in new york in october 1985 that 
nippon telegraph and telephone corp would buy a supercomputer from 
the united states 
nakasone prime minister between 1982 and 1987 told reporters 
feb 27 he knew nothing in advance about the supercomputer deal 
which is linked to widening stock scandal involving scores of public 
officials 
the inconsistency of his statements likely will worsen a 
political deadlock in the administration of prime minister noboru 
takeshita and increase opposition pressure for takeshita to resign 
analysts said 
nakasone released a statement saying his 1985 comments in new 
york was the result of a misunderstanding 
i think i made the statement based on my memory of news reports 
back then it said the trade friction between japan and the 
united states was at its critical stage then and i wanted to show 
our willingness to buy supercomputers made by cray research 
the scandalridden ntt purchased a supercomputer made by 
minneapolisbased cray research inc in may 1986 and resold it in 
december to recruit co a publishing conglomerate at the center of 
the massive stocktrading scandal 
opposition parties charge that nakasone directed ntt to buy a 
usmade supercomputer and sell it to recruit amid the friction 
between tokyo and washington over access to the supercomuter market 
the parliamentary session on the 1989 fiscal years budget has 
been stalled since wednesday when the government and the governing 
liberal democratic party rejected opposition demands to call 
nakasone to parliament for questioning 
nakasone was among 159 politicians business leaders and 
bureaucrats who bought bargainpriced stocks in recruitcosmos a 
subsidiary of recruit before the shares went public 
buyers earned handsome profits when the company was made public 
shortly afterward and share prices shot up 
three cabinet ministers have stepped down since december because 
of their link in the recruit scandal and the administrations 
popularity ratings have hit their lowest levels since takeshita took 
office in november 1987 
prosecutors have arrested 10 corporate executives and public 
officials for bribery and securities law violations more arrests 
are expected 
opposition lawmakers investigating the scandal charged nakasone 
was heavily involved three of nakasones aides earned more than 
465000 in profits from the stock deal 
ntt the former public telecommunications utility was privatized 
in 1985 three ntt executives including exchairman hisashi shinto 
were arrested for taking bribes from recruit 
ntt the largest company in the world in terms of stock values 
announced friday that in a gesture of public regret it will cut the 
salaries of 35 executives next month up to 20 percent for six months

the solidarity labor movement says the 
government has promised the opposition free access to staterun 
media during the new parliamentary elections 
janusz onyszkiewicz spokesman for the outlawed movement also 
said the union will support candidates in the june voting and wants 
solidarity candidates to be able to present themselves publically as 
solidarity members 
if these elections are supposed to be at least partly 
democratic we must have a chance to fight in them and that is why 
our access to the mass media during the campaigns is so 
important onyszkiewicz said 
an agreement between the government and the opposition will 
create a new national legislature a senate that will act as the 
upper chamber of parliament the current legislature the sejm 
would be the lower chamber 
opposition candidates will be allowed to take part in what may be 
the first national democratic elections in the communist block in 
addition 35 percent of the seats in the existing sejm will be set 
aside for contested elections 
however a new office of president with broad powers also will be 
created and that likely will remain in the hands of the ruling 
communists 
nevertheless the agreement is so far the most significant 
development during the six weeks of talks between the opposition and 
government on ways to solve polands crushing economic and social 
problems 
the discussions also have resulted in agreements in principle to 
legalize solidarity and other independent groups outlawed after a 
martiallaw crackdown in december 1981 
it had been uncertain if the oppositon which has no legally 
functioning political party and no legal newspapers or broadcast 
media would be able to get its message to the voters 
solidarity activist adam michnik speaking after a meeting of 
negotiators friday said authorities promised that opposition groups 
will be able to use state television radio and newspapers 
the government coalition side declared that the opposition or 
lets call it the social side will have access to the mass media 
for the period of the election campaign he said but we dont 
treat it as access to the mass media in general this is still 
the subject of deep conflict 
the opposition is seeking some program time on state television 
and radio to use as it chooses communist party negotiators oppose 
that saying it would undermine the internal integrity of the 
staterun broadcast media 
authorities have agreed that the opposition will be allowed to 
publish its own newspapers 
the powers of the new senate have not been established but 
negotiators said it would exercise some sort of veto control over

eastern airlines prepared to more than double its 
strikedepleted flight schedule but union leaders questioned its 
ability to expand operations and vowed to extend pickets to sister 
carrier continental airlines 
eastern announced its expansion plans as passengers began 
returning to its northeast shuttle lured by bargain fares of 12 a 
seat a federal bankruptcy judge also helped the carrier keep some 
planes aloft by authorizing eastern to pay nonstriking employees 
meanwhile lawyers for 8500 striking machinists accused the 
airline of timing thursdays bankruptcy filing to avoid paying wages 
to union members attorney robert clayman said he would go to us 
bankruptcy court in new york to get an estimated 75 million owed 
for the past week 
the crippled carrier said it planned to restore 80 flights a day 
mainly major east coast and latin american routes that would raise 
its total number of flights to more than 140 a day less than 15 
percent of its prestrike schedule 
this is the beginning of a new smaller restructured and viable 
eastern airlines eastern president phil bakes said friday 
eastern said it had 200 pilots available at the start of the 
week when it laid off 9500 workers and drastically reduced 
operations in addition spokeswoman cory zywotow said that since 
the bankruptcy filing pilots have been calling in to report back to 
work 
the pilots union which has been honoring the machinists 
pickets as well as flight attendants questioned whether the company 
could sustain the increased schedule for long without violating 
federal aviation administration restrictions on individual flying 
time 
theyre going to be able to slightly augment the current 
schedule but theyre just trying to maximize the available pool of 
pilots said jb stokes a 17year eastern pilot and spokesman 
for the air line pilots association 
pilots accused eastern of stepping up its campaign to threaten 
coerce and otherwise entice pilots to cross the picket line 
this includes illegal offers of bonuses for second officers and 
phone calls to pilots homes attempting to intimidate spouses and 
even their children with threats that their breadwinner will never 
be able to work again for eastern said ron cole a pilots union 
spokesman 
strikers also contended the crews on the restored flights 
beginning sunday and monday will be from continental and vowed to 
picket that airline which like eastern is owned by texas air corp 
machinists union officer wally haber said eastern has brought 
100 pilots and 60 mechanics from continental to miami to operate the 
restored flights 
union members today planned a show of solidarity at labor rallies 
in several cities including miami chicago and buffalo 
the machinists began picketing continental in its home base of 
houston and at philadelphia international airport and more than 300 
people rallied friday in support of the strikers at continentals 
terminal at newark international airport in new jersey 
theres going to be an allout effort to stop continental from 
operating legally said frank demaria secretarytreasurer of 
the machinists local in newark 
travel agents were wary about booking travelers on eastern after 
thousands of ticket holders were stranded around the nation many of 
those became unsecured creditors when the company filed for chapter 
11 reorganization and will have to file claims with the bankruptcy 
court to get a refund 
eastern intends to resume service between miami and 13 latin 
american cities and between boston and washington miami and san 
juan puerto rico miami and new york and new york and montreal 
eastern officials said 
company officials said they have recalled about 90 nonunion 
reservations agents to prepare for the expansion spurred in part by 
fridays offering of a 12 oneway fare on easterns shuttle between 
washington new york and boston 
steve davis an eastern spokesman at bostons logan international 
airport said bostonnew york shuttles flew 90 percent full friday 
shuttle flights earlier in the week reportedly carried as few as 
seven passengers 
the 12 fare will go up to 49 monday still below normal prices 
of 69 to 99 on weekends and 99 on weekdays 
before the strike eastern was the nations seventhlargest 
carrier with 1050 flights a day and some 31200 employees the work 
force has dwindled to 1500 and losses have grown to some 4 million 
daily since the strike began 
meanwhile a judge in new york extended indefinitely an order 
barring commuter railroad workers from honoring any picket lines 
thrown up by easterns machinists a federal appeals court in 
philadelphia issued a similar ban for that area

analysts say prospects are good for 
cutting conventional arms in europe because of the similarities in 
the initial proposals of nato and warsaw pact nations 
the starting positions are quite reasonable and give plenty 
of room for compromise said richard fieldhouse a research fellow 
at the stockholm international peace research institute in sweden 
the 16 nations of the north atlantic treaty organization and the 
seven of the warsaw pact began negotiations thursday in vienna on 
reducing conventional arms in the region 
we are not really that far apart chief us negotiator 
stephen ledogar said after the opening session soviet negotiator 
oleg grinevsky said the gaps were not insurmountable 
it looks like theres political will and interest to do the 
things required for an agreement fieldhouse said friday the 
question is can those things be maintained are they real and are 
they permanent 
negotiators will be under enormous pressure to succeed a 15year 
effort to cut those weapons in central europe failed 
in their starting proposal nato negotiators called on the warsaw 
pact to cut tanks artillery and armored troop carriers nato would 
make smaller cuts of 5 percent to 10 percent in those categories 
in its initial offer the warsaw pact proposed a firstphase 
reduction ranging between 10 percent and 15 percent of the lowest 
level of arms held by either side 
the percentage cuts proposed by each side are not far apart 
although the east wants the trims to include aircraft which western 
officials oppose 
nato contends the soviets and their allies have built up a huge 
superiority in conventional weapons in europe the alliance wants 
the east bloc to make much greater cuts in their forces to bring the 
two sides to equal strength 
analysts said the soviets appear ready to follow the wests call 
for greater east bloc reductions to reach parity in the weapons 
systems 
they noted soviet president mikhail gorbachevs recent promises 
of reductions in his nations troops and defense spending 
you dont make unilateral cuts unless you recognize you have a 
lot and too many said fieldhouse thats a big point in favor 
of progress 
the west would like a total of 40000 main battle tanks 33000 
artillery pieces and 56000 armored troop carriers in europe each 
side would be allowed half the total 
us officials estimated this would require the warsaw pact to 
get rid of 31000 tanks and nato 2551 for artillery the cuts 
would amount to 26900 for the east and 828 for the west 
the officials calculated the warsaw pact proposals using a 10 
percent reduction would mean cuts of 31849 eastern tanks and 3069 
for nato the easts artillery would be slashed by 20206 pieces and 
natos by 5706 the east would give up 28120 armored personnel 
carriers and the west 4690 
despite similarities in positions the differences portend long 
possibly acrimonious debates 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze has insisted the 
talks cover aircraft an area in which the soviets contend the west 
holds the edge

the government will free nearly 1900 
former members of ousted president anastasio somozas national guard 
on march 19 the chief of state security said 
commander lenin cerna said the jailed guardsmen will be freed 
after the national assembly formally approves a pardon request from 
president daniel ortega 
the pardons are the result of agreements signed by ortega and the 
presidents of el salvador guatemala honduras and costa rica at a 
feb 1314 summit in el salvador 
cerna who presides over a commission overseeing the releases 
said no restrictions will be placed on the former guardsmen they 
will be free to leave the country he said friday 
ortega said earlier this week that 41 exguardsmen would remain 
in jail 
the president defended the plan to pardon the former guardsmen 
who were jailed after the leftist sandinistas ousted somoza in a 
1979 revolution 
ortega called on nicaraguans to give guardsmen who are released 
the opportunity to reintegrate themselves into society 
the guardsman who wants to rejoin society has nothing to 
fear ortega said but he warned that those who return to their 
criminal activities would face popular anger in its full force 
the 1894 prisoners will be released during a ceremony at the 
modelo prison in tipitapa 14 miles west of managua cerna said 
in their agreement the regions presidents also said they will 
draft a plan by may 15 to dismantle the 11000member nicaraguan 
rebel army the rebels known as contras fled to honduras after 
us military assistance ended last year 
the united states began supporting the contras in 1981 the 
sandinista government and the rebels signed a provisional truce in 
march 1988 but talks on a permanent ceasefire have broken down

a fugitive indian arrested on kidnapping 
charges after failing to obtain asylum at the soviet consulate says 
he is a victim of persecution and sees no hope in the american 
government 
eddie hatcher 31 was arrested by fbi agents friday on a warrant 
for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution for his role in taking 
hostages at a north carolina newspaper last year said fbi spokesman 
chuck latting he was arrested immediately after leaving the 
consulate 
hatcher had gone to the soviet consulate to seek asylum and 
protest alleged inequities in the us justice system said 
bernadette sambrano a friend who accompanied him soviet officials 
asked him to leave after about three hours said sambrano a member 
of the international indian treaty council 
consulate press attache sergei aivazian declined comment 
hatcher and timothy jacobs 20 held up to 20 people hostage in 
the offices of the robesonian newspaper for 10 hours on feb 1 
1988 the two tuscarora indians said they wanted to draw attention 
to their claims that law enforcement officials were involved in drug 
trafficking and other corruption 
the siege ended when gov jim martin agreed to investigate their 
charges a task force found no evidence to support the claims and 
martin later said they were based on rumor and gossip 
in october a federal jury acquitted both men on federal 
hostagetaking and firearms charges after a threeweek trial but a 
robeson county grand jury indicted the two men on kidnapping charges 
in december 
hatcher was arrested in pembroke but jacobs fled the state and 
sought sanctuary at the onondaga indian reservation near syracuse 
ny 
hatcher fled to the same reservation after his 25000 bond was 
posted by the national council of churches he later left new york 
and sought refuge on the fort hall reservation in idaho he 
disappeared several weeks ago after being taken into tribal custody 
the state of nc and the government of the united states has 
made every vindictive attempt to destroy my life my family and my 
people hatcher said in a handwritten statement sent out of the 
soviet consulate they will not cease until they have accomplished 
this 
i see no hope in the american government nor do i see 
fairness 
jacobs was arrested in new york after leaving the reservation and 
a state judge is considering whether he should be extradited to 
north carolina 
harris tabac an attorney representing hatcher said the decision 
to retry hatcher on state charges was a boldly illegal move by a 
brutally racist county 
in our attitude the trial already occurred and we won he 
said 
tabac said he will ask for court hearings to argue that hatcher 
would be risking his life by returning to north carolina and has no 
chance of getting a fair trial there 
earlier in a telephone call from the consulate to the associated 
press bureau in raleigh nc hatcher said im tired of being 
persecuted for winning the federal case

a 7pound cubic sculpture set to soar into space on 
monday aboard the shuttle discovery is the nations first official 
interstellar art offering and for the foreseeable future its 
last 
boundless aperture the creation of boston artist lowry 
burgess was cleared for space travel by a national aeronautics and 
space administration committee in august 1984 as part of a new 
nonscientific payload program 
that was at a time when the space agency was looking both to open 
the shuttle program to the public and to accommodate civilians 
repeated requests to fly nonscientific objects 
but the committee was disbanded less than two years later after 
the shuttle carrying teacher christa mcauliffe and six astronauts 
exploded the tragedy prompted space agency officials to rein in 
civilian access to the space program 
burgess work will be on mondays scheduled flight as a special 
exception based on a prior commitment said nasa spokeswoman 
graciela iguina 
there is no intention to send any other objects up at this 
time said tony maull who was staff director for the 
nonscientific payloads committee that had approved burgess work 
in his bid to put his work in orbit the artist traveled several 
times to washington appeared for questioning before a nasa panel 
made hundreds of phone calls and sent as many letters over the last 
decade in an effort to persuade officials his work was worthy of 
flight 
i make no claim to understanding his work maull said but 
he definitely is not attempting to get a free ride for a commercial 
enterprise at the taxpayers expense 
nasa had been approached through the years by more than a few 
hucksters who sensed the profit potential in selling ballpoint pens 
or pendants that had been to space and back but maull said the 
agency was interested in taking the cultural high road 
this is a man whos invested a substantial portion of his life 
in this project he said 
burgess conceived the boundless aperture more than two 
decades ago as part of a larger project entitled the quiet axis 
as part of a visionary axis the artist has already embedded one 
sculpture in the pacific ocean floor off easter island and hauled 
another into central afghanistan where it was placed amid the hindu 
kush mountain range 
burgess a professor at the massachusetts college of art in 
boston said boundless aperture extends his work to space a 
metaphor for the potential of the human imagination 
its a part of saying there are many possibilities for us 
that space is going to open up many new things for us both out there 
and back here on earth he said 
burgess said the sculpture which will on its return be placed 
inside a rock outcropping on the grounds of the decordova museum in 
the boston suburb of lincoln is a nothing surrounded by nothing 
that is something 
it consists of a 6inch cube filled with distilled water inside 
of which floats another cube bearing colorful holographic plates 
inscribed with poetry 
the artist concedes his latest sculpture is fairly esoteric but 
insists that anyone can appreciate space art 
there are more art enthusiasts out there than the people at the 
museums he said a lot of people are very eager to see a 
cultural dimension to the space effort its humanizing

the military investigation of last summers 
shootdown of an iranian airliner found the navy cruiser vincennes 
was clearly responsible for the accident but the pentagons brass 
decided no disciplinary action was warranted 
in a case that went all the way up the ladder to thendefense 
secretary frank c carlucci and adm william j crowe the chairman 
of the joint chiefs of staff the pentagon announced last august the 
ships crew had made several understandable mistakes under the fog 
of war 
the military board of inquiry reported the vincennes was in the 
midst of a surface battle with iranian gunboats when irans flight 
655 took off from bandar abbas and the ships crew misidentified 
the commercial plane as a hostile f14 jet fighter flying a direct 
course for the cruiser 
the board also concluded that iran bore a substantial measure of 
blame itself for allowing a commercial plane to take off from an 
airport used by both commercial and military aircraft during the 
middle of a battle 
the iranian airliner also failed to respond to repeated radio 
warnings the board found 
carlucci and crowe said they had concluded the crew members acted 
as they did because they werent about to take any chances with 
their own ships safety that attitude had been reinforced by the 
fate of the uss stark which was struck by two missiles in may 1987 
when accidentally fired upon by an iraqi jet fighter a total of 37 
crewmen were killed 
it was only prudent for capt will rogers to assume that the 
radar contact was related to his engagement with the iranian boats 
until proven otherwise crowe said on aug 19 in releasing the 
inquiry report 
the proof never came crowe said given the time available 
the commanding officer could hardly meet his obligation to protect 
his ship and crew and also clear up all of the possible anomalies or 
ambiguities 
i believe that given the operating environment capt rogers 
acted reasonably and did what his nation expected of him in the 
defense of his ship and crew 
the destruction of the airliner was a byproduct of the 
iraniraq war the admiral concluded

bangladesh placed troops on alert along 
the indian border to guard against attacks by buddhist rebel 
tribesmen military sources in the region said today 
the sources in the chittagong hill tracts in southeastern 
bangladesh said they had received reports that rebels from the 
chakma tribe were planning raids from sanctuaries in india 
india has repeatedly denied the rebels have sanctuaries on its 
side of the border 
the bangladeshi sources who were contacted by telephone and 
spoke on condition of anonymity also said india had placed its own 
military troops on alert along the border 
an indian government spokesman in new delhi called the report a 
load of rubbish he spoke on condition of anonymity 
the rebels have been fighting a bush war against the bangladeshi 
government in an effort to win autonomy for the region and push out 
moslem settlers more than 3000 people have been killed since the 
revolt began in 1974 
on feb 28 the bangladeshi government passed legislation to give 
the hill tracts limited autonomy in an effort to end the insurgency 
under the new law hill tract residents would elect local councils 
with the powers to administer and develop the region appoint police 
and maintain law and order 
the military sources said the anticipated rebel offensive may be 
an effort to sabotage the governments peace plan in an effort to 
win greater autonomy 
chakmas make up about 75 percent of the 800000 people living in 
the hill tracts at one point the number of moslem bengali settlers 
reached 300000 but in 1985 president hussain muhammad ershad 
banned further moslem migration to the area 
the number of settlers declined as the chakmas continued their 
attacks western diplomats have estimated only about 100000 
settlers remain some other buddhist tribes also live in the region 
the area is impoverished but has unexploited pockets of natural 
gas efforts to survey and tap the gas in the early 1970s were 
halted because of rebel attacks 
the region is one of the few parts of bangladesh that generally 
remains above water during perennial floods in the densely populated 
nation of 110 million people

vice president dan quayle saying americans 
wont condone a new wave of mccarthyism harshly criticized some 
of his former senate colleagues over the failed nomination of john 
tower to be secretary of defense 
i think virtually every objective observer of senate 
proceedings in this matter has been deeply troubled by the raw 
sewage as one republican senator termed it that has spilled into 
the senate chamber in the form of excerpts from fbi reports and 
unsubstantiated anecdotes repeated for public consumption quayle 
said in a speech in indianapolis friday 
everyone understands this is not politics as usual that this 
is trial and conviction by rumor and is a violation of the standards 
of decency said quayle we will not condone a new wave of 
mccarthyism in this country 
tower burdened by reports of alcohol abuse and womanizing was 
rejected by the senate as secretary of defense 5347 thursday on 
friday president bush announced he selected rep richard cheney 
rwyo as the new nominee for defense secretary 
asked about quayles remarks bush said in washington i 
havent seen what he said so i cant tell you whether he speaks for 
me i speak for myself he speaks for himself 
however bush said he understands why quayle feels the way he 
does 
in washington responding to quayles remarks sen alan 
cranston dcalif said i fought sen joe mccarthy in the 1950s 
when dan quayle was still in kindergarten i can inform the vice 
president that he is using the same tactic joe mccarthy used 
guiltybyassociation 
three times during his 25minute speech quayle said the tower 
debate recalled the 1950s when republican sen joseph mccarthy of 
wisconsin used innuendo and trumpedup charges to accuse people of 
having ties to communism 
quayle a 42yearold former indiana senator making his first 
trip home since becoming vice president said allegations based on 
rumor and innuendo shouldnt be used to tear down the reputation of 
a public figure 
asked at a news conference if he believed a senate debate on one 
public figure amounted to a trend toward mccarthy tactics quayle 
said what im doing is just putting out a warning that if theyre 
going to rely on this kind of information for denying people a 
position in the cabinet we will not condone it nor will the 
american people 
quayle speaking to 1500 people at a luncheon meeting of the 
economic club of indianapolis also said the rejection of towers 
nomination signals a legislative attack on the power of the 
presidency 
why has the tower affair evoked such intense feelings quayle 
said i think its because every republican senator understands 
that it is not just the bush administration that is under attack it 
happens to be the constitutional prerogatives of the executive 
branch 
quayle said he had never encountered such anger and bitterness 
in the senate chamber as he did thursday

arab students who helped sponsor a public 
reading of the satanic verses say they may not like author 
salman rushdie but they want to show that not all moslems support 
ayatollah khomeinis death decree against him 
about 300 people attended friday nights reading and panel 
discussion on the university of iowa campus twentyfive people read 
twominute selections from the book that many moslems claim 
blasphemes their faith 
wan hasni a member of the iowa city islamic society and a 
statistics student said he and other muslims attended the session 
at the iowa memorial union to hear the views the feelings of 
others in the american community have about this book 
a demonstration is appropriate if we need one but it would 
have served no purpose to disrupt the reading he said 
saadi simawe a representative of the arab students association 
who organized the event said the reading aimed to demonstrate that 
not all moslems support khomeinis action 
fanaticism is always an aspect of insecurity simawe said 
i read the koran i respect the prophet i think islam is a great 
religion if taken personally once you are going to impose it on 
others it is very dangerous 
the koran is not fragile it is not a blade of grass that you 
can destroy it by a book it is a living book said simawe a 
doctoral student from iraq studying english and africanamerican 
world studies 
bill fuhrmeister director of security at the university said a 
handful of officers stood guard at the reading in case of 
disruptions or violence 
but the only signs of protest were two islamic society members 
who quietly held large posters defending irans order that rushdie 
be killed 
freedom of speech does not mean you can insult onefifth of 
earths population said a sign held by mubarak alajmi also a 
student at the university of iowa 
if someone insults your family you would stand up and do 
something about it well what rushdie has insulted is my religion 
which means more to me than even my family alajmi said 
mahmoud rizig president of the iowa city islamic society said 
he urged his groups members to attend the reading and carry protest 
signs but not disrupt the event 
rushdie a british citizen who was born into a moslem family in 
india has been in hiding since feb 14 when iranian clerics 
offered a 52 million reward for his death 
the writers workshop and the international writing program at 
the university sponsored the reading along with the arab students 
association the general union of palestinian students the indian 
students association and the pakistani students association

religious leader were sentenced to life in prison for killing the 
guru as he spoke to hundreds of his followers 
rajinder singh batth 39 and mangit singh sunder 26 wearing 
orange turbans chanted god is great victory to the god as

southall in west london 100 miles away to address hundreds of 
supporters in a school

a federal probe has found evidence that 
mexican authorities extorted money from aliens headed for the united 
states leading some smugglers to alter their routes a newspaper 
reported 
the alleged corruption was described in three internal us 
immigration and naturalization service memos dated feb 22 and feb 
23 the brownsville herald reported friday 
the memos were written by em trominski ins district director 
in mexico city to the office of foreign operations in washington 
dc 
one memo quoted an ins special agent working in matamoros across 
the border from brownsville as saying the bus depot is being 
worked by mexican customs and other agencies all on the take the 
bribe situation has caused the smugglers to offload groups outside 
of matamoros and to get them downtown by other means avoiding the 
bus station 
border patrol intelligence officers in south texas and silvestre 
reyes sector chief in mcallen failed to return repeated phone 
calls 
verne jervis ins spokesman in washington said he was unaware of 
any ins agents operating in mexico to do that you have to get 
permission of the host country he told the newspaper 
the memos addressed activities of ins antismuggling teams in 10 
mexican cities guatemala and el salvador detailing techniques used 
by alien smugglers and steps taken by ins agents in mexico to 
infiltrate smuggling operations 
major smugglers are chartering buses to move aliens one memo 
stated the buses reportedly stay away from the federal highways 
because of fear of ripoffs by mexican authorities using back 
roads instead it said 
one memo said a group of 38 guatemalans and 1 salvadoran was 
ripped off in the amount of 5 m million pesos 2100 by the 
federal highway police who then called the municipal police 
a cable from san salvador had specific information regarding 
alien smuggling by air from san salvador to tapachula mexico 
one memo said the information was specific including names of 
pilots and aircraft tail numbers 
trominksi wrote i gave my personal observation that if true 
such an operation could not take place without some sort of 
official help 
two memos also reported that mexican immigration director general 
susana torres hernandez was concerned that the recent policy to 
immediately detain illegal aliens in south texas might leave large 
numbers of undocumented central americans stranded in mexico 
straining the countrys scarce social services

because of what it called the danger of war posed by the ussouth 
korea military exercises that begin next week 
the norths official korean central news agency monitored in 
tokyo said president kim il sung issued the order and warned that 
if the united states and south korea dare provoke a war against 
us our revolutionary armed forces and entire people will turn out 
as one in the fight to defend the sacred fatherland 
about 200000 us and south korean troops are expected to take

scheduled to begin on tuesday in the south 
north korea has demanded a halt to the exercises calling them a 
preparation for a nuclear attack on the north us and south korean

security 
north korea has issued similar orders in the past at the time of 
the annual exercises 
the north korean people love peace but do not want 
confrontation and war the news agency said but we will never 
allow any attempt of the us imperialists and the south korean 
puppet clique to threaten and provoke us at random

the korean peninsula was divided into the communist north and the 
capitalist south at the end of world war ii in 1945 when us and 
soviet troops ended japans colonial rule over the region the two 
koreas have remained enemies since the 195053 korean war

southwest florida regional airport in fort myers on friday 
passengers said 
the stewardesses were all frantic they kept running in and out 
of the cockpit on our way back said trish merkel of fort myers 
passengers said the plane flew so low returning to the airport 
that cars below them looked almost lifesize and the planes 
landing was as abrupt as its turnaround some said 
i thought we had gone too far and overshot the runway the way 
we stopped said eric swanson 20 of chicago he really hit the 
brakes hard and stopped us fast 
fortyseven passengers used emergency slides to escape but 
firefighters called to the plane realized within minutes that the 
gasoline smell had come from a passengers pants

fbi investigators tried to determine whether 
vengeful terrorists were behind the bombing of a van driven by the 
wife of the uss vincennes skipper who mistakenly ordered the downing 
of an iranian airliner 
sharon rogers 50 the wife of capt will rogers iii narrowly 
escaped injury friday when she got out of the van after it was 
rocked by what sounded like two backfires moments later a pipe 
bomb explosion engulfed the vehicle in flames authorities and 
witnesses said 
concerned that terrorism may have penetrated americas borders 
the fbi began a massive investigation involving scores of 
investigators said tom hughes special agent in charge of the local 
fbi office 
were going to be working this with every available resource of 
this division and other divisions if necessary said hughes 
ted royster assistant special agent in charge of the bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms los angeles office said he has 
assigned six atf agents to help the fbi 
they view this incident as an act of retribution against capt 
rogers for the incident in the middle east royster said 
a justice department source in washington who spoke on condition 
of anonymity said investigators suspect the bombing was the work of 
terrorists however local fbi investigators would not confirm that 
theory 
we certainly do not rule out the potential retribution to capt 
rogers for his command in the navy hughes said but on the 
same token this could have been perpetrated for some other reason 
unknown at this time 
mrs rogers received a threatening call last july shortly after 
the iranian jetliner was shot down from someone she guessed might 
have been middle eastern the new york times reported today quoting 
an unidentified pentagon official the caller said are you the 
wife of the murderer frightening mrs rogers into hanging up the 
newspaper said 
an unidentified justice department source told the san diego 
union that rogers and his family received at least two telephoned 
death threats from callers who said they were acting in response to 
the jetliners destruction 
one of the calls was placed to rogers at the san diego naval 
station the day before the december bombing of a pan am jet over 
lockerbie scotland that killed 270 people the union reported 
today 
rogers reaction to the van bombing was one of disbelief 
according to a friend us rep bill lowery rogers hadnt expected 
his family to be exposed to danger on the homefront said lowery 
rcalif 
rogers said military personnel stationed abroad realize theyre 
in peril but no one expects you have to be worrying about your 
wives and kids back home lowery quoted rogers as saying 
sen pete wilson rcalif who also spoke with the couple 
quoted mrs rogers as saying thank god this did not happen on 
thursday because i was carrying six children in the van that 
morning she teaches fourth grade at la jolla country day school 
rogers was in command of the vincennes a guidedmissile cruiser 
based in san diego when it exchanged fire with iranian speedboats 
in the persian gulf last july 3 during the battle an aircraft that 
rogers thought was an iranian f14 fighter appeared on the us 
warships hightech radar after the plane failed to respond to 
warnings on civilian and military channels rogers gave the order to 
shoot it down 
the aircraft was actually an iranian airbus a300 a civilian jet 
wih 290 people aboard all died when the plane was hit by a 
vincennes missile 
rogers later said he regretted the deaths but that his decision 
was made in defense of his ship and crew the skipper was backed by 
the reagan administration which also decided to compensate the 
victims families 
but after the shooting irans ayatollah ruhollah khomeini called 
for an allout war against the united states speculation after the 
destruction of the pan am jetliner focused on whether that bombing 
was in retaliation for the vincennes action 
mrs rogers was driving alone to school and was stopped at a red 
light when the bomb exploded at about 745 am friday the pipe 
bomb pieces of which were recovered was planted on the underside 
of the white toyota van police spokesman bill robinson said 
an unidentified official told the los angeles times that mrs 
rogers thought her van had been rearended when she heard the two 
popping noises and got out to look for damage 
she got out just as it blew said kurt lent a construction 
worker 
lent who watched the van explode said he heard a pair of 
backfires separated by a 10second interval and then a loud 
explosion 
it went boom boom then bam he said it worked 
real quick 
john christy a masonry contractor supervising a work crew near 
the blast scene said he ran over to the burning vehicle and saw a 
woman standing near it 
for what had just happened she reacted like a real strong 
type of person he said i called her husband he came down here 
maybe about four minutes later they embraced and went from there 
the couple was taken to an undisclosed and protected location 
navy spokesman cmdr david dillon said their son who attends 
colgate university was notified and offered protection the fbi 
said 
the navy increased its security at the san diego navy base and 
other facilities navy chief petty officer craig huebler said other 
vincennes crewmembers and their families were notified and they were 
urged to take whatever precautions they deemed necessary 
the vincennes returned from its sixmonth persian gulf deployment 
last october it remains in port and rogers remains its skipper

rosetta kirks had been nursing her newborn son 
for three weeks when she noticed he looked small then she realized 
shed been given the wrong infant 
today shes back home with her real 9pound son nicolas 
im sure this is the right one a beaming ms kirks 30 of 
inglewood said friday night as she cradled the boy im just glad 
to have my baby back 
genetic tests completed earlier friday confirmed nicolas was ms 
kirks son and that she had received the wrong infant when she left 
the maternity ward at kaiser permanente medical center 
based on our own investigation and corroborating blood tests 
it appears that two infants were in fact discharged to the wrong 
sets of parents said kaiser spokeswoman janice seib 
the hospital was investigating the apparent mixup and reviewing 
its procedures ms seib said 
both families and infants have gone home with the right 
people she said as far as were concerned thats it 
but the attorney for ms kirks and tommy milligan the father 
told reporters he will work to see such mixups dont occur again at 
kaiser 
somethings wrong or faulty nobody should be put through what 
those people have been put through the hospital shouldnt have done 
that said attorney jerome j eisenberg 
the other parents identified as nicholas and firdowsa amad 
mallet of baldwin hills couldnt be reached for comment hospital 
officials said they wanted privacy 
both babies were born at kaiser on feb 11 
ms kirks became suspicious last sunday when she looked at a 
photograph taken just after her sons birth and noticed the infant 
she was caring for seemed smaller said gene murphy a spokesman for 
eisenberg 
that baby had chubby cheeks and the one she had at home had 
itty bitty cheeks murphy said 
ms kirks son was 21 inches long and weighed 9 pounds 3 ounces 
at birth said shelly shellmire another spokesman for eisenberg 
the baby ms kirk had gone home with initially was 18 inches long 
and weighed 6 pounds she said 
she got nervous shellmire said she went to the dresser 
and got the babys arm band and discovered that it had a different 
name on the arm band 
the mother then took the baby back to kaiser and asked for her 
son 
blood typing chromosome studies and dna typing confirmed the 
babies identities 
hospital officials said they wouldnt speculate how the mixup 
occurred until the investigation was completed 
the policies and procedures that we have in place at this time 
are in accordance with numerous regulating and governing agencies 
we are confident that they are in every way adequate and 
appropriate we are reviewing adherence to those policies ms 
seib said

the main church of the ruling 
white afrikaners for the first time has declared apartheid a sin and 
expressed guilt over its role in promoting racial segregation a 
church leader said today 
the black and mixedrace branches of the dutch reformed church 
praised the admission but said the mother church must act to bring 
down apartheid 
we confess with humility and sorrow the participation of our 
church in the introduction and legitimation of the ideology of 
apartheid and the subsequent suffering of people the white branch 
of the dutch reformed church said 
apartheid cannot be accepted on christian ethical grounds 
because it contravenes the very essence of reconciliation 
neighborly love and righteousness it said 
it is the most explicit condemnation of south africas system of 
legal race discrimination made by the white branch of the church in 
1986 the church reversed its decadesold support of segregation and 
said apartheid was a mistake but stopped short of calling it a sin 
or heresy 
the statement was released late friday after a weeklong meeting 
between the white and black and mixedrace branches of the church 
the black and mixedrace branches welcomed the statement but 
said strong differences with the mother church remain 
it is encouraging that there are ministers in the white drc 
that call for fundamental and comprehensive changes said the 
black and mixedrace churches but it is vital that they should 
embark on acts of liberation within church and society 
they called on the white church to condemn specific apartheid 
laws and develop a theology counteracting apartheid 
piet roussouw chief executive of the white church said today 
such issues would be addressed at a meeting next week 
the important thing is that we are working together to address 
the problem of discrimination and suffering roussouw said 
the dutch reformed church is by far the largest and most 
influential church among south africas 5 million whites it counts 
president pw botha and virtually all his cabinet ministers among 
its congregants giving it considerable influence in national 
policy about 11 million of the nations 28 million blacks are 
members of the black branch and 680000 of the 3 million mixedrace 
people belong to their branch 
in 1986 the white church opened membership to all races but few 
nonwhites responded there are a handful of white church ministers 
who serve black congregations and a few blacks occasionally attend 
services in churches of the white branch 
the church provided the scriptural foundations for apartheid when 
the governing national party came to power in 1948 and began 
codifying racial segregation df malan the prime minister from 
194854 when most apartheid laws were enacted was a minister in the 
church

matter 
earlier nkala had testified to the commission that his wife

democratic party chairman ronald h brown 
told his party today to carry on its debate about the role of 
government and be firm about the future of our party and our 
country 
brown spoke to a meeting of the democratic leadership council at 
which party leaders debated how to break their presidential campaign 
losing streak 
for the first time in a long time we are thinking big said 
brown we are acting like a party that believes in sensible 
government 
the party chairman said democrats are also acknowledging that 
we understand the limits of government and the responsibilities of 
prudent stewardship of government 
if we carry forward this debate vigorously we can be firm 
about the future of our party and our country because in the thick 
of this debate lies the seeds that will grow into our partys next 
national victory 
the difficulty democrats are having framing a message that will 
appeal to the middle class without alienating poor and minority 
voters became clear at the dlc meeting friday when jesse jackson 
sparred with party leaders who view him as trying to take the party 
in the wrong direction 
the issue is not just who leads us but who needs us jackson 
told the meeting 
he urged the democrats to declare their support for striking 
eastern airlines workers 
if we dont show those workers were on their side were 
missing something big jackson said 
but sens charles robb of virginia and sam nunn of georgia made 
it clear they want the party to aim its message more to the middle 
class 
while acknowledging that we cant take our base for granted 
robb said democratic candidates have to convince voters that they 
believe in a strong defense and firm measures against crime 
he said one reason democrat michael dukakis carried only 10 
states in the 1988 presidential election was that the american 
people did not view him as credible 
he praised jacksons eloquence and said that if the twotime 
candidate for the democratic presidential nomination would deliver 
our message there is no question in my mind we can carry the day 
but robb continued the democrats must help jesse get that 
message straight 
nunn said he agreed with robb and added that he and jackson 
have some very fundamental differences in philosophy 
the georgia senator said he acknowledged that jackson was one 
of the people in the country who has the largest following and the 
people who support him are an extremely important element in the 
democratic party 
he said that any democratic presidential candidate must be able 
to bridge the different groups championed by jackson and more 
conservative democrats 
the political assessments heard by the conference were 
unrelievedly gloomy 
democratic support is hemorrhaging in the heart of the 
electorate said nunn the current chairman of the dlc 
a party in exile was how texas sen lloyd bentsen the 
partys 1988 vice presidential candidate described the democrats 
status as a national party 
the democratic party has lost the ability to sustain a 
presidential majority based on a progressive agenda said william 
galston former issues adviser to walter mondales presidential 
campaign in 1984 and now a professor at the university of maryland 
rather than facing reality we have embraced the politics of 
evasion galston said the result has been repeated defeat and 
if we do not stop and learn and change we will keep on losing 
sen bob graham of florida the state that gave bush his greatest 
margin of victory over democrat michael dukakis talked about the 
mcdonaldization of american politics and said americans are 
electing to buy their hamburgers at the republican stand 
nunn cited the dlcs role as a catalyst for new thinking in the 
party and the country 
but he said the dlcs progress has been overshadowed by a 
larger failure the collective failure of democrats to reverse our 
partys dismal record in national presidential elections

north korea said today the trial of a woman who 
confessed to planting a bomb on board a south korean airliner that 
disappeared in 1987 was an attempt to dampen south korean desires 
for reunification 
we have already made it clear that we have nothing to do with 
the incident the norths official korean central news agency said 
in a report monitored in tokyo 
the report was the first north korean reaction to the trial in 
seoul south korea of a woman identified as kim hyon hui 
she has confessed to being a north korean agent and placing a 
bomb on the korean air boeing 707 before it disappeared near burma 
over the andaman sea in november 1987 all 115 people aboard are 
presumed to have died 
the trial began tuesday and the north korean news agency said 
prosecutors only repeated the old plot full of contradictions 
which they had used several times to shift the blame for the kal 
incident onto us in a farfetched way 
it did not explain the contradictions 
through the trial south korean officials seek an aim of 
emasculating the south korean peoples sentiments for 
reunification with the north the report said 
after the plane disappeared the woman and a companion an 
elderly man were arrested in bahrain they attempted to commit 
suicide by taking cyanide hidden in cigarettes the man died but 
the woman recovered and was extradited to seoul 
the woman told the court that kim jong il son and political heir 
of north korean president kim il sung had ordered her to blow up 
the plane

the palestinian uprising in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip cost israels economy 666 million in 1988 an 
aide to communications minister gad yaacobi said today 
yaacobi blamed the losses mainly on greater military spending an 
increase in army reserve duty a drop in production and tourism and 
difficulties in attracting foreign investment said spokewoman naama 
henig 
he also warned that the costs to the economy might be at the 
same level this year ms henig said yaacobi a member of the 
leftleaning labor party was economics minister until november 
when he became communications minister 
the uprisingrelated costs nearly wiped out israels economic 
growth initially forecast at 25 percent israel radio quoted 
yaacobi as saying instead israels 35 billion economy grew by 1 
percent in 1988 considerably less than the 5 percent in 1987 
in a related development defense minister yitzhak rabin was 
quoted as saying today he decided to shift the burden of putting 
down the uprising from reserve soldiers to regular troops and 
specially trained border police units 
we want to reach a situation where reserve soldiers serve a 
maximum of 44 days a year instead of many now serving 62 days 
rabin said on israel radio 
the interview was broadcast a day after the army shifted some of 
its troops out of gaza strip refugee camps in an effort to reduce 
tension and fatal clashes 
the redeployment also came as foreign minister moshe arens left 
for a 10day visit to the united states where he was expected to 
counter pressure to reduce friction in the occupied lands 
rabin denied that the redeployment was designed to appease the 
united states saying the main objective was to reduce the burden 
on the reserve soldiers 
paying for thousands of reserves is proving costly the defense 
ministry has estimated the cost of combating the uprising is about 
14 million a month 
the uprising has also hurt tourism with only about 13 million 
tourists entering the country in 1988 down 14 percent from the 
previous year israeli officials had expected 1988 to be a banner 
year because of the states 40th anniversary celebrations 
production was hurt because as many 30000 of the 110000 
palestinians employed in israel have quit their jobs 
at the same time the sale of israeli goods to the territories 
fell 70 percent in 1988 to about 140 million according to the 
industry ministry

the dispute resulting from salman rushdies new 
novel goes far beyond an argument over ethics and theology it has 
disrupted diplomacy and global trade pitted western notions of free 
speech against islamic fervor and added a frightening element to 
the issue of foreign hostages in lebanon 
unlike previous episodes in the wests rocky 10year relationship 
with iran the crisis over the satanic verses seems to offer no 
room for compromise 
is this a religious conflict a political conflict or a little 
of both mused foreign minister thorvald stoltenberg of norway 
one of 15 western countries that recalled their ambassadors from 
iran in protest of the death order 
how can we meet the iranian problem without compromising our 
basic principles while avoiding escalation and the danger of 
dramatic conflicts he said 
stoltenbergs question sums up a dilemma facing western 
governments four weeks after ayatollah ruhollah khomeini called on 
moslems to kill rushdie 
whatever the economic stakes no western politician can afford to 
be seen condoning a murderous threat to artistic freedom and no 
moslem leader can be seen to condone a book that allegedly 
blasphemes allah and mohammed his prophet 
were being confronted with an extreme demand theres no 
middle ground its not a thing on which there can be any 
compromise says bernard adamczewski an analyst at the 
londonbased institute for the study of terrorism 
the crux of the problem he says is that islam does not 
recognize the concept of separation of religion and state and cannot 
accept the western argument that governments are powerless to 
suppress books on religious grounds 
iranian religious leaders have offered a 52 million bounty for 
the death of rushdie a british citizen who was born into a moslem 
family 41 years ago the writer is in hiding under police guard 
moslem countries share a united sense of outrage over the book 
and most have banned it but only libya has supported the death 
sentence unequivocally 
most moslem governments balk at the death sentence saying 
rushdie should at least be tried by an islamic court 
britain has solid backing from its 11 european economic community 
partners but fears this solidarity may waver we have a beady eye 
on the weaker brethren foreign office minister william waldegrave 
said thursday 
countries as mutually hostile as india and south africa have 
banned the book israels chief rabbi has urged his country to ban 
it so as not to strain moslemjewish relations any further 
the soviet union must perform a delicate balancing act it has 
been asked by the united states and britain to intercede with iran 
but it is mindful of its own burgeoning moslem population 
in india and pakistan with their large moslem populations the 
satanic verses is fraught with political danger and antirushdie 
riots have killed at least 19 people 
western nations have universally denounced the death threat and 
the eec countries along with austria norway canada and sweden 
have withdrawn their ambassadors from tehran in protest 
japan canceled a visit to tehran by foreign minister sousuke uno 
britain which in december was enjoying a longawaited thaw in 
its ties with iran has supplanted the united states as the wests 
great satan in iranian terminology 
iran severed diplomatic relations with britain on march 7 and 
hopes dimmed for the release of three britons held hostage in 
lebanon 
britain advised british citizens to leave lebanon and an iranian 
newspaper said the cut in ties will have a negative impact on 
the fate of the british captives who are believed held by 
proiranian extremists 
the british tried to soothe iranian anger by ackowledging the 
satanic verses insulted moslems and some britons as well but they 
apparently see no more room for maneuver on wednesday the 
government announced it was expelling up to 30 iranians as security 
risks 
britains stance has already cost it a major oil technology trade 
fair it was planning in tehran this month 
industrialized countries vary in their willingness to reduce 
economic ties with a nation poised to spend billions on 
reconstruction following its eightyear war with iraq 
even britain says it doesnt want a trade cutoff 
trade with iran is vital to some countries and no one put it 
more bluntly than new zealand prime minister david lange when he 
said he wouldnt jeopardize 153 million worth of farm exports to 
iran and cause new zealand sheep farmers to go out of business 
because of a threat made to a bookwriter in london 
domestic criticism made lange back down and register a protest 
with iran but he refused a british request to recall his ambassador 
from tehran 
probably the harshest retaliation came from west germany irans 
biggest trading partner which has suspended negotiations on export 
credits reportedly totaling at least 1 billion 
france advised its oil companies to reduce imports from iran

the senate burned by the bitter partisan 
struggle over the nomination of john tower as defense secretary is 
moving with lightning speed on the selection of dick cheney with 
both democrats and republicans predicting quick confirmation 
almost as soon as president bush announced his choice friday 
sen john warner ranking republican on the senate armed services 
committee consulted with sen sam nunn the chairman and told 
reporters hearings on the nomination would begin this week 
they will probably be related to policy issues and thereafter 
the issues of background and financial data will follow and as soon 
as that material is completed the committee will complete its 
actions and send the nomination to the floor said the virginia 
senator 
the quick schedule which warner summed up in seconds bears no 
resemblance to the tower confirmation proceedings that dragged on 
for nearly seven weeks and ended with a rancorous debate that 
divided the senate 
tower whose 24year stint in the senate included chairmanship of 
the armed services committee was dogged by allegations of excessive 
drinking womanizing and conflict of interest for his lucrative 
defense consulting work 
senate debate on the nomination was unprecedented because of its 
detailed discussion of towers alcohol consumption questions about 
the use of material from a confidential fbi report and various angry 
accusations and insinuations flying back and forth among the 
debaters 
a bit of anger lingered friday when vice president dan quayle 
prepared a speech accusing democrats of engaging in a mccarthyite 
mudslinging campaign against tower and waging an assault on the 
powers of the presidency 
senate republican leader bob dole commenting on the cheney 
nomination got in a dig this time it will be a confirmation not 
an execution he said 
whatever the undercurrents of resentment bush and senate 
republicans were talking quick confirmation of the 48yearold 
cheney a sixterm conservative congressman from wyoming who served 
as white house chief of staff during the ford administration 
as minority whip cheney is no 2 in the house republican 
leadership structure 
i believe this will go very fast bush said in announcing the 
nomination i believe we will have smooth sailing 
the president said friday he would order the fbi to speed up its 
background checks to get the nomination moving too much time has 
been wasted here he said 
gop members of the armed services panel said they did not foresee 
any roadblocks to confirmation and there was nothing from democrats 
to challenge that assessment 
i do not know what possible skeletons could exist in that 
closest said republican sen malcolm wallop a fellow wyoming 
politician 
warner called cheney a wonderful perfect nomination while 
sen strom thurmond of south carolina no 2 republican on the armed 
services panel said the nominee is a man of integrity and 
dedication 
hes widely respected in congress and a firstrate choice for 
quick confirmation said sen charles robb dva 
hes a very able and impressive person said sen tim wirth 
dcolo a member of the senate armed services committee hes one 
of the smartest people in congress 
senate majority leader george mitchell of maine said he was 
pleased that president bush has moved quickly and added that 
cheney has served with distinction in the us house of 
representatives since 1978 
the true gauge of cheneys prospects will be nunn the powerful 
committee chair who led the fight to defeat the tower nomination 
the georgia democrat was reserved in his reaction issuing a joint 
statement with warner that called cheney well known and highly 
respected by the members of the senate 
later nunn told reporters i know of no impediment to his 
nomination 
unlike the twicedivorced tower cheney has been married for 28 
years to lynne vincent of caspar wyo she is a well known 
washington figure herself currently as head of the national 
endowment for the humanities 
cheney is on the house permanent select committee on intelligence 
and was a member of the house panel investigating covert arms deals 
with iran 
cheneys selection came as a surprise because he lacks defense 
experience but even democratic whip alan cranston of california 
didnt see that as a problem 
i think dick cheney knows what one needs to know when one takes 
over that post cranston said he will learn a lot more detail 
now he is well aware of the broad concepts and as chief of staff at 
the white house he had to know a great deal about national defense 
matters

since a recent stroke 
president pw botha has lost his stature as the domineering master 
of south african politics suddenly he is depicted as a tragic 
figure clinging to power against the wishes of former loyalists 
those who have done bothas bidding for a decade now are engaged 
in a concerted campaign to push him into retirement botha signaled 
his intention to fight back but there has been a dramatic lack of 
public support for the man whose tough tactics earned him the 
nickname the great crocodile 
the result for the moment is a power struggle between botha and 
his heir apparent education minister fw de klerk 
de klerk took over as leader of the governing national party when 
botha resigned that post feb 2 two weeks after his stroke 
since then de klerk has consolidated his support among 
nationalist members of parliament and has made no move to disavow 
reports he wants botha to quit the presidency 
botha 73 struck back last week by announcing he planned to 
return to work march 15 two weeks earlier than expected he gave no 
indication he was considering early retirement or a powersharing 
arrangement with de klerk 
de klerk and three senior party leaders emerged tightlipped from 
talks with botha on thursday the talks were incisive and will 
resume at a later date de klerk said 
the crisis continues said the frontpage headline the next 
day in beeld a progovernment daily 
de klerk briefed members of the national party caucus about the 
talks with botha although sworn to secrecy several legislators 
were quoted anonymously in the press as saying there was almost 
unanimous support in the caucus for de klerk and widespread anger at 
bothas perceived intransigence 
south african political correspondents reported many caucus 
members blamed bothas attitude on misleading information provided 
by his inner circle of advisers during his recuperation because of 
this misinformation several reports said botha underestimated the 
depth of caucus support for de klerk and overestimated its loyalty 
to the president 
in the aftermath of the de klerkbotha meeting there was 
sympathy for the president among party officials wrote business day 
political reporter mike robertson because having been sheltered 
by his personal staff it was probably the first time he had been 
confronted with the reality that virtually the entire caucus wanted 
his reign to end 
but there is no evidence any such sympathy translates into active 
backing there have been appeals for botha to be allowed to step 
down with dignity but there have been virtually no calls for de 
klerk to pull back and leave botha in total command 
there also are doubts about the presidents health botha 
indicated in his statement thursday doctors feel he is ready to 
resume work but his left arm was trembling markedly during his only 
poststroke public appearance last month and his daughter rozanne 
was quoted friday as saying she was extremely worried about her 
fathers condition 
de klerk 52 is widely viewed as more pragmatic and openminded 
than botha although he is not expected to push through radical 
political changes many south africans are seeking the transfer of 
power in hopes it will change the mood in the country with de 
klerks relatively conciliatory approach replacing the sometimes 
bullying demeanor of botha 
de klerks brother willem de klerk a former newspaper editor 
who broke with the government because of his opposition to south 
africas system of racial segregation recently wrote a magazine 
article assessing a possible de klerk presidency 
as a good negotiator he is certain within the system to 
defuse some of the tension that has accumulated under the botha 
regime he wrote of his brother he is by nature a democrat 
he is fair friendly and humble 
by contrast the johannesburg financial newspaper business day 
in an editorial thursday said bothas imperious style had set the 
stage for his current plight 
since his elevation to the presidency he and his royal family 
have been strutting and posturing like hereditary monarchs holding 
ridicule at bay only by the fear that he inspired the editorial 
said the fawning around his feet was pitiful to see

twill be a grand st patricks day after all for millions of 
catholics who faced the disheartening possibility of eating their 
cabbage and potatoes straight up 
some fellas named oconnor and quinn and a few of their pals have 
decided to make a wee bit of an exception march 17 to the rule 
forbidding roman catholics from eating meat on fridays during lent 
the special dispensations granted by bishops in irish 
enclaves throughout the country in recent days will permit many of 
the nations 53 million catholics to have their corned beef and eat 
it too 
were very grateful that they understand that fish doesnt 
have any place in a good irish stew said dorothy cudahy who will 
be grand marshal of the st patricks day parade in new york city 
up until the 1960s the catholic church banned meat on all 
fridays it was a penitential practice in commemoration of the death 
of jesus christ on a friday and also in expressing sorrow for 
ones sin said the rev michael walsh head of the office of 
pastoral research and practices for the us catholic conference 
the rules changed in 1966 when pope paul vi issued a papal 
document allowing church leaders in each country to establish their 
own rules on doing penance 
in the united states bishops decided to encourage catholics to 
do other forms of penance most of the year but kept the friday ban 
on meat during lent which runs from ash wednesday to easter 
the basic principle is that it is good for the soul to do some 
sort of penitential practice said bill ryan deputy director of 
the office of media relations for the catholic conference 
but individual bishops still hold the right to grant special 
dispensations and thats just what many did after they realized st 
patricks day falls on a friday this year 
they include cardinal john oconnor of new york archbishop john 
quinn of san francisco cardinal bernard law of boston and their 
counterparts in chicago cincinnati buffalo ny and newark nj 
the prelates have asked those who eat meat on st patricks day 
to observe another day of abstinence or do some other additional act 
of penance 
individual catholics always remain free not to follow the fasting 
regulations for just and serious cause walsh said but the 
bishops action kind of eases everybodys conscience 
we have an old expression in the latin ecclesia est benigna 
mater the church is a kind mother said monsignor william 
stanton pastor of a church in predominantly irish south buffalo 
her children are feasting and why not 
one observer in san francisco said quinn was just a step ahead of 
his flock with the dispensation 
sure sure sure theyll all be eating corned beef especially 
in the places where its free said john whooley publisher of the 
irish herald newspaper the archbishop was wise to do that because 
theyll all be eating it anyway 
a cincinnati restaurant owner said theres only one item they 
could have banned that would affect affect her business on march 17 
most people as long as they can get green beer thats all 
they care about said helen russum coowner of the crows nest on 
the citys west side 
not everyone agreed with dropping the ban on meat 
the rev daniel hurley a campus minister at st bonaventure 
university in western new york said he would prefer the church keep 
the centuriesold ban as a sign of reverence but he is not going 
to be holierthanthou about the whole thing 
if it were my decision id probably stick with it throughout 
lent hurley said since it isnt ill probably take advantage 
of it

weeks of smallscale tibetan protests 
arrests tightened security and wild antichinese rumors built up to 
last weeks violent clashes in lhasa according to western and 
tibetan sources 
they painted a picture of steadily mounting tension in tibets 
capital and persistent acts of defiance by buddhist monks and nuns 
who have initiated most protests since chinese troops entered tibet 
in 1950 the sources identity and whereabouts cannot be revealed 
for fear of reprisals 
tensions burst last week they said when tibetans tried to 
commemorate two anniversaries a march 5 1988 clash with police 
that left 24 people dead and a march 10 1959 uprising against 
chinese rule in which hundreds died and tibets spiritual and 
temporal ruler the dalai lama fled to india 
the commemorations brought more bloodshed 16 dead and more than 
100 wounded by official count many more by tibetan count 
pressure began building shortly after a dec 10 clash when 
police fired on marchers killing at least one monk and a tibetan 
child twenty days later students from tibet university held a 
brief peaceful march to protest the police action 
on jan 3 city education officials said students who even stood 
on the sidelines of future protests would be expelled according to 
a copy of their order shown to the associated press 
buddhist monks at lhasas leading monasteries meanwhile decided 
to boycott a major prayer festival because chinese authorities broke 
a promise to increase the quota of people allowed to become monks 
the official media did not report the boycott they said the 
festival was canceled out of respect for the panchen lama tibetan 
buddhisms secondranking religious leader who died of a heart 
attack jan 28 
the panchen lamas death led to new tensions a rumor began 
circulating that the overweight 50yearold monk was assassinated 
because days before he died he criticized beijings policies in 
tibet no evidence was produced but the rumor triggered a small 
protest tibetans told an american traveler 
another rumor said chinese plans to renovate the potala in lhasa 
were an excuse to destroy part of the revered 17th century building 
the huge stone palace on a hill lhasas most prominent feature was 
seat of tibets theocratic government in recent years it has been 
turned into a tourist site 
on feb 3 monks at lhasas sera monastery hoisted the banned 
snow lion flag over their buildings where it flew all morning 
without police action 
three days later on tibetan new year lhasa residents woke to 
see the nationalist flag flying over the jokhang temple tibetan 
buddhisms most sacred site pilgrims tossed white ceremonial 
scarves to the roof 
there must have been hundreds of scarves piled up by midday 
said steve marshall of new orleans who witnessed the silent 
protest the flag was taken down in the middle of the night 
four times in late february and early march small groups of 
monks and nuns walked around the jokhang carrying a picture of the 
dalai lama or chanting independence slogans 
tibetan witnesses and one participant said bystanders intervened 
several times to hustle marchers away before they could be arrested 
but the police also seemed anxious to avoid confrontation 
instead said one tibetan they photographed the marchers in order 
to arrest them later he reported seven arrests 
advance word about the march 5 protest circulated among 
tibetans indicated it also was planned as a smallscale event 
the pattern broke when police opened fire 
from then on the tibetans anger turned on anything chinese 
they vandalized their stores and stoned chinese cyclists 
still unclear is why police shifted tactics 
martial law imposed midnight tuesday remained in force saturday 
with heavily armed soldiers manning checkpoints throughout the city 
more anniversaries are coming march 17 is the day the dalai lama 
left lhasa for india in 1959 on march 19 and 20 1959 the chinese 
army used heavy artillery to suppress the uprising 
most protests have been the work of individual monasteries there 
is no evidence of a central resistance organization 
the goals are simple to express four decades of anger over what 
is perceived as alien rule and possibly win outside support one 
tibetan source said protesters hoped the united nations would open 
an inquiry into chinese human rights policies in the region 
independence remains a vague concept except among young 
westernized tibetans in india none of the lhasa protesters has 
articulated goals beyond the return of the dalai lama 
even tibetan college students inside china say they have not 
considered how tibet would be ruled if it were independent 
we cant even talk about independence said a 20yearold 
woman there are too many chinese and too few of us what we want 
is for the chinese to understand our culture and stop discriminating 
against us if not in a short while there will be no more tibet

on a crisp october morning william borders 
drove out of a suburban motel parking lot with a garment bag packed 
with cash and an fbi undercover agent beside him in the front seat 
minutes later the highliving and well connected washington 
attorney was under arrest and headed down to the road to a fiveyear 
prison term but that was far from the end of the tale 
after seven years district judge alcee l hastings of miami is 
still waging a stubborn fight to hang onto his black robe as the 
senate prepares for his impeachment trial arising from events of 
that fateful day oct 9 1981 
if convicted the 52yearold hastings floridas first black 
federal judge would not face criminal penalties he was acquitted 
of conspiracy by a jury in 1983 and he claims that verdict should 
have settled the matter 
the outspoken hastings however does stand to lose his seat on 
the bench and his 89500 salary if the senate convicts him 
this isnt some agriculture bill were talking about 
hastings said in february following a senate rules committee 
session this is my office 
the senate this week takes up a hastings move for dismissal of 16 
of the 17 charges in the bill of impeachment approved aug 3 by the 
house 4133 they say he plotted with borders to obtain a bribe and 
lied about it at the 1983 trial another count says he improperly 
divulged data produced by a wiretap and thus torpedoed a federal 
investigation 
the senate plans to hear arguments on wednesday and make its 
decision concerning dismissal of the charges on thursday 
presentation of evidence if it comes to that will take place 
later before a special senate committee with videotapes of the 
proceedings available for senators unable to attend the sessions 
when that will happen is unclear but hastings attorney terence j 
anderson says it should not happen at all 
the senate should ask itself can a trial that is fair be 
conducted anderson says is it feasible is it practical is it 
possible and if the answer is no the senate should just say were 
not going to do it were not going to take the time out from our 
schedule and subject the man to this ordeal 
but both sides are digging in for weeks of skirmishing 
hastings has been going on washington radio shows in recent weeks 
and urging sympathizers to attend the senate session 
hastings stands accused of conspiring with borders to obtain a 
150000 payoff from brothers frank and tom romano of miami who had 
been convicted of skimming more than 1 million from a teamsters 
pension fund loan 
in return say authorities hastings planned to restore to the 
brothers more than 1 million they forfeited because of their 
conviction and guarantee them no prison time 
the romanos however both of whom have since died had no 
interest in paying a bribe 
they did send a gobetween to a meeting in a miami paint and body 
shop with borders associate william dredge a north miami antique 
dealer but the two brothers wanted no part of the proposed fix 
that did not stop the fbi dredge under indictment in a 
baltimore narcotics case and eager to please was persuaded to 
introduce retired agent h paul rico to borders under the name of 
frank romano 
soon rico masquerading as romano was asking borders for some 
gesture that would prove he really was working with the judge they 
hit on a deal in which hastings would appear for dinner in the main 
dining room of miamis hotel fountainbleu at 8 pm on sept 16 
1981 
hastings did appear at the appointed hour but scoffs at the 
notion that he did so as a signal in a bribe plot 
it is not the only circumstantial evidence prosecutors claim 
hastings gave a coded signal he was about to fix the case when he 
said in a wiretapped phone conversation with borders ill send 
the stuff to columbia in the morning nonsense says hastings 
about the only thing certain is that many of those involved spent 
hours wandering through the fountainbleu in the course of the 
investigation 
at one point fbi agents acting on a dredge tip followed borders 
to the fountainbleu lobby where he met with florida mob boss santo 
trafficante at the time a defendant in another case before hastings 
it was more than enough to raise eyebrows at the time borders 
was aprominent washington criminal lawyer a former president of the 
national bar association and a member of the district of columbias 
powerful judicial selection committee 
he also was an effervescent high roller who seemingly always 
could arrange a suite at washingtons plush lenfant plaza hotel and 
thought nothing of taking his girlfriend to las vegas for the thomas 
hearnessugar ray leonard fight for her birthday 
during the term of president carter according to a 1987 
house judiciary committee report borders became a very high 
political advisor primarily through the democratic national 
committee 
indeed a testimonial dinner topped off by a moonlight boat ride 
was planned for him on oct 9 the day he accepted a garment bag 
packed with 125000 in cash from rico still masquerading as romano 
as borders pulled out of the parking lot and turned onto 
interstate 395 he was surrounded by fbi cars and he told rico 
glumly were busted 
hastings who had checked into the lenfant plaza in advance of 
the testimonial dinner received word of the arrest and that fbi 
agents were searching for him from another guest hemphill pride a 
onetime law school classmate 
the judge hastily packed his suitcase and returned to miami 
where he was located later than night and placed under arrest

leaders from 24 nations today 
signed a pact asking the united nations to police efforts to curtail 
ozonedestroying chemicals and other air pollutants 
those who signed the accord included king hussein of jordan and 
presidents francois mitterrand of france hosni mubarak of egypt 
daniel arap moi of kenya and robert mugabe of zimbabwe 
the meeting arranged by the dutch government followed an ozone 
conference of 123 nations earlier this week in london at that 
session 20 countries promised to join 33 nations that have already 
agreed to halve emissions of ozonedestroying chemicals by the end 
of the century 
the united states and the 12nation european community have gone 
further they have pledged to try to ban the chemicals called 
chlorofluorocarbons by 1999 if safe alternatives can be developed 
the compounds have widespread use in aerosol spray cans and 
refrigerators as well as in the electronics and plastics industries 
the new pact billed as the hague declaration says the 
united nations should be given authority to set and monitor air 
pollution rules according to a western diplomat familiar with the 
documents contents he spoke on condition of anonymity 
however the proposal would be an agreement in principle without 
legal force on the nations that sign it the diplomat said 
he said the document does not specify whether there should be a 
new un body to fight air pollution or whether the new 
responsibilities should fall to a strengthened un environment 
program which is based in nairobi kenya 
either way he said the united nations would get authority to 
define standards to enhance or guarantee the protection of the 
atmosphere and monitor compliance the diplomat quoted the hague 
document as saying 
the participants at the conference discussed the gradual 
depletion of the delicate ozone shield that protects earth from 
cancercausing solar radiation and the rise in global temperatures 
known as the greenhouse effect 
government leaders at the dutch gathering included west german 
chancellor helmut kohl and premiers felipe gonzalez of spain 
ingvar carlsson of sweden and gro harlem brundtland of norway 
the hague document says the world court should back up un 
efforts to control the chemicals the diplomat said but he 
acknowledged that the court the uns legal arm depends on 
voluntary compliance 
he said details of the proposal will be worked out in the next 
few months and a broader international accord on atmospheric 
pollution is expected to be signed by october any changes in un 
authority would also need approval of the bodys general assembly in 
new york

poverty in americas cities has grown more 
persistent and concentrated over the last two decades and its 
victims have less chance of escape according to a report by the 
national league of cities 
the study describes a changing face of poverty since 1970 with 
the nations poor more likely now to live in metropolitan areas and 
concentrate in lowincome neighborhoods 
it said the proportion of children living in poverty has 
increased and the likelihood of people climbing above the poverty 
level has declined 
poverty in cities is changing in quality and intensity the 
report said it is more persistent among particular households 
more concentrated within particular neighborhoods and more isolated 
from traditional avenues of escape 
the league released its report poverty in cities as nearly 
3000 municipal leaders gathered in washington for the 
organizations annual winter meeting which runs through tuesday 
both the figures and the trends are alarming alan beals 
executive director of the national league of cities said in 
releasing the report such conditions are devastating for those 
caught up in it especially children 
the report an analysis and compilation of previous research 
said poverty in america declined through much of the 1970s to a 
rate of under 12 percent at the end of the decade but a resurgence 
brought the rate to more than 15 percent by 1985 and the average 
rate for the years 1980 through 1987 was over 14 percent the league 
said 
the portion of the nations poor living in metropolitan areas 
grew from 62 percent in 1979 to 70 percent in 1985 an increase of 
76 million people with the majority living in central cities it 
said 
the report said the persistence of poverty that is the length 
of time a person remains poor has grown it cited previous studies 
of the proportion of urban poor in a given year who escaped poverty 
the following year and said in the late 1960s that figure was 32 
out of 100 
called the escape probability the figure rose to 37 out of 
100 in the mid1970s meaning that poverty became less persistent 
but began declining and was 23 out of 100 by the early 1980s 
there has been a substantial decrease in the chances that a 
poor person will escape poverty within the following year it said 
an increase was also recorded in the proportion of poor residents 
of big cities who live in neighborhoods that are classified as 
extremely poor where at least 40 percent of residents live below 
the poverty line among the 50 largest cities the 
concentrationofpoverty rate increased from 16 percent in 1970 to 
24 percent in 1980 meaning nearly onequarter of the largecity 
poor lived in extremely poor neighborhoods 
the report said poor neighborhoods of large central cities have 
become increasingly isolated from the rest of the metropolitan 
areas with more clear differences in socioeconomic and physical 
conditions 
as more ghetto dwellers live in more isolated deprivation their 
opportunities for jobs training and other means of climbing out of 
poverty are reduced it said 
the study said blacks and hispanics were more likely than whites 
to live in extremely poor neighborhoods and poverty among blacks 
was more persistent than for other groups more than 21 percent of 
blacks living in big cities were persistently poor throughout the 10 
years between 1974 and 1983 it said compared to a rate of less 
than 3 percent for nonblacks 
the poverty rate among children it said grew from 16 percent in 
1979 to over 20 percent in 1985 which it called a startling 
increase 
the report was written by mark alan hughes assistant professor 
at princeton universitys woodrow wilson school

the rev david scheider is having a 
difficult time practicing what he preaches when it comes to middle 
east hostage terry anderson 
scheider has been urging residents of andersons hometown in 
upstate new york not to despair over the journalists nearly four 
years of captivity in beirut lebanon 
we americans are an actionoriented people its so difficult 
for us to sit back and just pray he said 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press was kidnapped march 16 1985 by moslem extremists in beirut 
and has been held the longest of 12 foreign hostages 
residents of batavia will gather this week to observe the 
anniversary of andersons abduction 
there isnt a person in town who doesnt know who terry is and 
who doesnt regret whats happened to him said steven hawley a 
high school classmate of anderson a 1965 graduate of batavia high 
school 
batavia a city of 17000 located 35 miles east of buffalo has 
shown its concern to mark the third anniversary of andersons 
capture hundreds of residents donned yellow ribbons and marched in 
a candlelight vigil and people turned out by the thousands to sign 
greeting cards that were sent to beirut for his 41st birthday last 
october 
however the events masked deep anxiety within the community over 
what to do about the hostages 
many people support andersons sister peggy say who has 
traveled throughout the world urging national leaders to work for 
her brothers release 
however her outspokenness including complaints that american 
officials have not done enough for the hostages has put off some 
members of the community 
batavia is a conservative town built around a veterans 
administration hospital with a sign that reads the price of 
freedom is visible here 
some people even considered mrs say unpatriotic for criticizing 
the reagan administration said hawley a republican legislator in 
genesee county 
even mrs says supporters such as ann zickl acknowledge that 
her comments were difficult for some people to accept 
shes a strong strong woman and this is a traditional 
community mrs zickl said 
some questioned whether negative attention generated by mrs 
says comments served the captors purposes 
at some point many people began to wonder whether the media 
attention may have been responsible for prolonging things said 
kathy conley another classmate of anderson who had been active on 
his behalf and i think i might agree that his captors certainly 
know what an issue he has become 
mrs say acknowledges that the situation became politicized but 
she insists she had no other option but to speak out 
former hostages have told mrs say that andersons captors would 
kill him if they thought americans had forgotten him 
my path is clear she said weve got to keep the pressure 
on because thats what has kept terry alive 
mrs say spoke from her home in cadiz ky where she said she 
and her husband david moved last year for privacy 
she has returned to batavia several times to meet with supporters 
and for interviews with the local media and was expected to return 
sunday for an ecumenical service at notre dame high school 
her supporters say attitudes are changing

rep richard cheneys personal and campaign 
finances indicate he approaches his nomination as defense secretary 
with almost none of the baggage that helped sink the first man 
president bush picked for the job 
unlike john tower who was rejected by the senate in part because 
of his relationships with the defense industry cheneys financial 
benefactors have been dentists insurance companies farm groups and 
energy companies 
and although the wyoming republican has been paid better than 
most of his house colleagues for giving speeches raising a total of 
81350 in 1987 he gave 59000 of that to charity according to 
his most recent financial disclosure forms 
that was more than he had to give away to meet house limits and 
none of the money had come from the defense industry 
over the last five years cheney has raised more money through 
speaking fees 266875 than even house republican leader robert 
michel who got 250888 according to a study by common cause he 
kept 107937 of that an average of a little over 20000 a year 
cheneys disclosure forms show that he is financially comfortable 
but is not rich 
in 1987 he earned between 226333 and 290833 and had assets 
worth between 200000 and 530000 he had less than 50000 in 
debts 
cheney depended on special interests to pay for about a third of 
his last reelection campaign which cost some 292000 a 
relatively small amount for congressional races 
while much of his campaign money came from energy insurance and 
farming interests cheney did raise more than 13000 from defense 
contractors however all but one of those defense interests gave 
far less than the legal limit according to records filed with the 
federal election commission 
that one company fmc corp gave cheney the 5000 legal limit 
through its political action committee 
other defense contractors contributing to his 1988 campaign 
included lockheed corp and martin marietta corp which each 
donated 1500 and trw inc and united technologies corp which 
each contributed 1000

in the aftermath of the senates rejection of 
former texas sen john tower for secretary of defense republican 
punsters grumbled that their nominee had been brought down by a 
relatively new phenomenon nunnpartisanship 
the play on words a part snide and part comical reference to 
sen sen nunn underscored both the pivotal role the georgia 
democrat played in the struggle over the tower nomination and the 
irony that nunns influence in a partisan battle stemmed largely 
from his reputation as the senates bipartisan defense expert 
nunn chairman of the senate armed services committee said when 
the tower debate began that he expected some permanent bruises 
before it was all over 
and for the first time in his 16year senate career as the 
debate raged throughout last week unn heard republican colleagues 
hurl heated and repeated charges of partisanship in his direction 
this goes into the memory banks senate minority leader bob 
dole of kansas said after singling out nunn for special criticism 
following towers defeat 
but while the tower fight may have tarnished nunns reputation 
for nonpartisanship political observers say his stature within the 
national democratic party has been enhanced 
with a number of moderate to moderateliberal democrats this 
will increase his influence kevin phillips a republican 
political analyst said in an interview friday 
he has chits with them that he may actually be able to cash in 
for what some people would think of as more responsible defense 
policy phillips said this gives him leverage to pull hitherto 
nondefense democrats into a more defense posture 
william schneider a political analyst with the american 
enterprise institute said nunns role in the tower fight will move 
him onto center stage in national democratic party politics 
within his party he will probably have more clout because he 
delivered schneider said he delivered a real punch to the 
president of the united states 
hes enhanced his image of power as a national democratic 
player and as someone who delivers he said on the other hand 
there is obviously a downside hes sacrificed some of the 
bipartisan appeal he had in the past 
both before and during the tower debate republicans accused nunn 
of using the battle to increase his control over us defense policy 
and to launch his bid for the democratic presidential nomination in 
1992 
nunn repeatedly denied any such motivations saying his actions 
were being questioned simply because he had the evidence on his side 
and was leading the fight against tower 
schneider said he has seen nothing to suggest that nunn was 
motivated by a desire to dominate national defense policy or to 
enhance his presidential prospects 
but if he does want either one of those things the tower fight 
has helped both of those ambitions he said hes more of a 
player in national security policy and hes more of a figure in 
democratic party politics no question about it 
theres also little question that the controversy over the tower 
nomination has changed the way nunn is viewed in the senate the 
hard feelings generated by the fight as doles comment suggests 
wont soon be forgotten 
the difficulty for nunn and the difficulty for everybody else 
is going to be that it is a whole new ball game phillips said 
its not the old ball game that sam nunn had been playing in that 
he had scored very well in 
this is a new national ball game and its going to be a 
different one and its going to have its share of unpleasantness 
said phillips

democratic leaders of congress endorsed 
saturday their partys search for a new agenda and signaled 
president bush that they are willing to set aside the bitterness of 
the debate over john tower 
in a joint appearance at the annual meeting of the democratic 
leadership council house speaker jim wright of texas and senate 
majority leader george mitchell made pointed references to the need 
for a bipartisan foreign policy 
for his part bush also appeared eager to put the tower debate 
behind him within 24 hours of the rejection of his first choice for 
secretary of defense the president selected rep dick cheney 
rwyo for the post and democrats greeted the choice warmly 
notwithstanding the tower nomination debate i believe our 
first objective must still be to reestablish a bipartisan foreign 
policy mitchell told the dlc 
we shall seek avenues of agreement with this new president 
said wright well support a bipartisan foreign policy and many of 
mr bushs domestic goals but well not be subservient 
it is a democratic tradition to take the risk of proposing new 
ideas and defending them said mitchell it is a democratic 
tradition to have an agenda 
sen jim sasser of tennessee sounded a more partisan note when he 
said the fresh breeze that we heard in january has rapidly turned 
into the doldrums of march 
he described the new republican administration as a government 
adrift and said it appears there is a policy vacuum at least 
for the time being 
while there was widespread agreement on the need for a bipartisan 
foreign policy the democrats were engaged in a sometimes heated 
debate on the direction the party should take on domestic issues 
the dlc was formed four years ago by officeholders determined to 
stem what they saw as the national partys leftward drift 
wright warned that the idea that democrats must choose between 
representing the poor and minorities on the one hand or middle class 
whites on the other was quite possibly the most foolish suggestion 
i have ever heard 
to make a choice between the interests of the median income 
americans and those of the less fortunate who want only to scale the 
ladder to join the median income ranks would be an act of 
selfdefeating folly said the house speaker 
democratic party chairman ronald h brown told the dlc the party 
must define what it stands for and that democrats must not lose 
our sense of direction or our sense of confidence 
brown praised the dlc for developing a public service proposal 
now endorsed in part by bush 
republicans think community service is something you are 
sentenced to after you are caught quipped the chairman 
as a former aide to sen edward m kennedy and jesse jackson 
brown won the chairmanship over the opposition of many dlc members 
i know there are many in this room who were less than wildly 
enthusiastic about the prospect of ron brown being chairman of the 
democratic national committee said brown 
but he said he was attending the dlc meeting to demonstrate how 
committed i am to working with you 
its very important that you are here and i appreciate the 
spirit that you bring sen bob graham of florida told brown after 
his speech 
brown offered an optmistic view of where the party was heading in 
the wake of its fifth loss in the last six presidential elections 
for the first time in a long time we are thinking big he 
said we are talking like a party that believes in sensible 
government 
if we carry forward this debate vigorously we can be firm 
about the future of our party and our country he said

space shuttle discoverys cargo bay 
holds a 100 million satellite whose deployment will complete an 
orbiting communications network and enable nasa to shut six ground 
stations at a savings of 3 million a month 
the astronauts release of the 2ton tracking and data relay 
satellite into its own orbit 22300 miles up is the main goal of the 
28th space shuttle mission scheduled for liftoff here monday morning 
the first tdrs was launched from challenger in 1983 and 
challenger was carrying a second one that was destroyed along with 
the sevenperson crew in the disaster of jan 28 1986 
the national aeronautics and space administration considers the 
tdrs system so vital to space communications that tdrs satellites 
were assigned to two of the first three shuttle missions after the 
challenger explosion 
on the first of those missions discoverys crew successfully 
launched a tdrs last september if the third satellite is 
successfully launched monday on the third postchallenger flight 
the system will be complete with the two newest satellites in use 
and the oldest one serving as a spare 
liftoff is set for 807 am monday for a fiveday mission with 
five astronauts on board discoverys countdown was put on hold for 
seven hours saturday morning because high winds on friday had slowed 
launch preparations but nasa said the delay should not affect the 
launch 
under the current system 14 ground stations are stationed around 
the globe and the shuttle communicates with earth by beaming 
messages down to whatever station is closest which then relays the 
information to mission control because the stations are so widely 
spaced astronauts aboard the shuttle cant radio earth at all for 
85 percent of the time 
with the tdrs system the shuttle will be out of radio contact 
with mission control just 15 percent of the time and it will be able 
to transmit much more data instead of radioing down to a ground 
station the shuttle will send and receive its messages by 
transmitting upward to the tdrs satellites one high over the 
atlantic and the other high above the pacific 
because the tdrs satellites are positioned much farther away from 
earth than the shuttle in orbit they have the vantage points that 
will allow the shuttle to maintain radio contact with a single 
ground station on earth almost all the time 
the tdrs also will improve communications with other satellites 
including some military satellites 
with its seven antennas a tdrs satellite can transmit to the 
ground station at white sands nm the equivalent of a 20volume 
encyclopedia in one second 
scheduled for closing are stations at ascension island in the 
south atlantic santiago chile guam kauai hawaii dakar 
senegal and yarragadee australia they employ a total of nearly 
400 people and most stations date back to mercury americas first 
maninspace program in the early 1960s 
three of the stations at madrid spain canberra australia and 
goldstone calif will not be closed but will be used by a space 
project managed by the jet propulsion laboratory pasadena calif 
the other five stations will provide tracking data as a shuttle 
is launched or is landing they are at merritt island and ponce de 
leon in florida bermuda wallops island va and dryden flight 
research facility calif 
charles hunter tdrs project manager for nasas goddard space 
flight center in maryland said the closings will save nasa about 
3 million a month once we get operational 
astronauts robert springer and james bagian are to release the 
satellite from discoverys cargo bay 6 hours 13 minutes after launch 
at an altitude of 184 miles 
an attached rocket stage is to ignite and boost the satellite to 
a stationary orbit 22300 miles up a series of groundcontrolled 
maneuvers over several weeks will shift it to its permanent outpost 
high above the pacific near south america 
trw space amp technology group builds the tdrs satellites for 
contel which leases them to nasa

the bush administrations turnabout proposal 
aimed at dampening latin americas debt crisis is getting generally 
good reviews despite some reservations that it may not go far 
enough to quell the regions explosive social unrest 
treasury secretary nicholas brady spurred on in part by the 
venezuelan riots that claimed 300 lives two weeks ago announced 
friday that the us government was switching gears and looking 
favorably for the first time on forgiving some of the third worlds 
crushing 13 trillion debt 
the new plan turns away from the reagan administrations policy 
of piling new debt on top of the old it is directed primarily at 
latin americas most heavily obligated nations such as mexico 
venezuela and brazil which have accumulated some 410 billion in 
loans 
rep charles schumer dny a key member of the house banking 
committee and a specialist on international finance lauded the 
shift 
it is clear that the administration has finally kicked the 
habit new money will no longer be used to bail out the bad 
schumer said after the brady speech 
but schumer said as did others that bradys proposal lacked 
detail and did not define how extensive the debt relief might be he 
noted that the proposal calls for voluntary action on the part of 
the lending banks 
two looming questions remain how much relief can actually be 
provided on a voluntary basis and how carefully will that relief be 
channeled to actually raise living standards in third world 
countries the congressman said 
in their attempts to meet the demands for economic reform from 
their creditors latin american nations have cut wages and 
government subsidies resulting in sharply reduced living standards 
amidst stalled economic growth 
the result a rising tide of political and economic instability 
in those key latin nations has become the focus of increasing 
concern to members of congress and the administration as well as 
the international banks that have extended the billions in loans 
in order to encourage the commercial banks to look more favorably 
on debt forgiveness the administration also called on the two major 
international lending institutions the world bank and its sister 
organization the international monetary fund to provide guarantees 
of interest and other assurances against debts that go bad 
james d robinson chairman of american express co and the 
author of his own debt relief plan which he put forward in 1988 
said after bradys address 
the good news is that the momentum is getting underway the 
financing techniques are within reach the question is whether the 
political will is there 
he quipped that he was pleased that the concepts of debt relief 
and debt forgiveness are no longer xrated words 
robinson cautioned that the administration must keep the momentum 
moving and make the plan a top priority when the imf and world bank 
meet in washington at the end of the month and it must be pursued 
at the annual economic summit of the worlds leading democracies in 
paris in july he added 
this is no longer a banking problem it means jobs and 
international security robinson warned 
such expressions of concern were echoed by venezuelas president 
carlos andres perez who termed the brady proposals very timid 
adding that they do not go far enough to satisfy the minimum 
aspirations of latin america 
but the venezuelan leader also welcomed the proposals for opening 
a dialogue with the administration of president bush 
in mexico president carlos salinas de gortari hailed the 
proposal as a first and positive response to mexicos position 
and he sent his treasury secretary pedro aspe to washington for 
talks with us officails 
mexico which is attempting to restructure payments on its 107 
billion debt is seen by several debt experts as the most promising 
candidate for the new approach 
both sen bill bradley dnj a member of the senate finance 
committee and world bank head barber conable asked on friday for 
special consideration for mexico because of its progress toward 
economic reform 
if investment is not made and jobs are not created in mexico 
the united states could face a tidal wave of illegal immigration 
bradley warned 
bradley in a commentary published in friday editions of the new 
york times noted that the rise of mexicos leftist cardenista front 
for national reconstruction has exactly paralled the drop in living 
standards 
unless mexico is granted sufficient debt relief in a timely 
fashion bradley asserted americas southern neighbor will be 
thrown into economic chaos or revert to selfdestructive 
nationalism

madeline kahn loves the role of billie dawn in 
the broadway revival of born yesterday but she lives with being 
compared to judy holiday who created the role onstage in 1946 and 
later won an oscar for the film 
i knew accepting the challenge of the role that i might 
fail she said in an interview in saturday editions of the new 
york post 
a lot of actresses who are known and who are risking a 
reputation rather than an unknown and risking nothing would not do 
this role because they dont want to be unfavorably compared to 
her i decided to do it but it was always a ghost in the back of my 
mind 
she called the part in the garson kanin comedy a wonderful 
classic role 
the revival closely follows the original but miss kahn says she 
once experimented with modernizing a line it was effective she 
said but changing it once was enough 
to say to a man in 1946 drop dead was beyond belief now 
the equivalent would be obscene i know i tried it once she said 
in the scene she paused turned to costar ed asner who plays 
the part of the rude crude and wealthy junk dealer harry brock and 
suggested that he kiss a certain part of her anatomy 
the audience was shocked and they laughed a lot miss kahn 
said but i wouldnt do it a second time its funny but its not 
what the playwright wrote and its not in the spirit of the 
writing

us officials said saturday following an 
unprecedented inspection of soviet mental hospitals that they could 
not determine whether patients still are held because of their 
political beliefs 
a team of psychiatrists lawyers and interpreters interviewed 27 
patients and former mental patients in a review spurred by western 
charges of widespread psychiatric abuses 
the soviet union withdrew from the world psychiatry association 
in 1983 under pressure from the west it has pledged to end abuses 
and hopes to be readmitted this year to the association 
at a news conference saturday the americans refused to discuss 
individual cases or their conclusions about the soviet mental health 
system 
we will not deny that this has been a very sensitive and 
difficult undertaking to carry out to our full satisfaction said 
delegation leader robert w farrand of the state departments bureau 
of human rights and humanitarian affairs 
asked if he could say if there were any political prisoners still 
in soviet mental hospitals farrand responded that no one can 
prove the negative 
he said however that the human rights situation in the soviet 
union had improved substantially the number of people the us 
government lists as political prisoners is well down from 750 
two years ago farrand said 
we would not have agreed as a government to come to moscow in 
1991 for a human rights conference if we had not been convinced that 
the question of political prisoners had in the main been 
resolved he said 
the teams lead psychiatrist dr loren h roth of the university 
of pittsburghs law and psychiatry program said soviet officials 
were late in providing some medical records and that some patients 
had been discouraged from consenting to interviews 
however he said the group eventually was able to interview those 
people 
delegation sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said they 
had no indication of retribution against patients who gave 
interviews 
yuri a reshetov head of the soviet foreign ministrys office of 
international cooperation and humanitarian affairs said there are 
no political prisoners in mental hospitals 
but he said some people named on western human rights lists may 
be undergoing treatment due to specific concrete actions against 
the law 
of the 27 people interviewed 15 were in mental hospitals and 12 
were former mental patients farrand said 
all were being held for political reasons according to reports 
by western human rights monitors patients were permitted to request 
that soviet doctors not be present during the interviews 
the americans visited seven mental hospitals including 
facilities in kazan leningrad and chernyakhovsk under the control 
of the interior ministry which is responsible for the soviet 
unions uniformed police 
hospitals controlled by the ministry have been identified as 
places where dangerous criminals and political prisoners have been 
held 
under a government decree in january 1988 those hospitals are 
being transferred to the jurisdiction of the health ministry which 
runs all other mental hospitals the decree also made it a crime for

the first time william haast brought home 
poisonous snakes his horrified mother left home for three days she 
came back only because she realized her sons interest wasnt about 
to slither away 
at 78 haast remains a selfdescribed snakeaholic who has 
kept his energy and enthusiasm though he just weathered his 148th 
snake bite it is not surprising it was the viper not haast who 
passed on 
haast is founder and director of the miami serpentarium 
laboratories which he started in miami in 1946 he relocated the 
lab to salt lake city five years ago to concentrate on venom 
research and production 
haast claims to be the first to standardize snake venom and 
produce it for research use his clients include wyeth laboratories 
the only producer of antivenins in north america and almost every 
university in the country he also has helped foster research into 
the use of venom against such diseases as polio multiple sclerosis 
and aids 
haast was in his lab collecting venom from a pakistani pit viper 
feb 28 when the serpent bit his left thumb not overly concerned 
he waited to see if the weekly venom injections he has given himself 
for 40 years would provide immunity to the poison 
when the bite was still bleeding after 24 hours he took himself 
to the hospital and was diagnosed in critical condition the venom 
robbing his blood of the ability to clot doctors said he could have 
bled to death from a bump or fall 
i guess i excited every hematologist blood doctor in town 
he said they dug up all the information they had on snake bites 
haast who was released from the hospital wednesday praised the 
extraordinary efforts in his behalf to obtain antivenins from 
california england the soviet union and even from private sources 
in iran a white house aide helped contact foreign sources and ease 
passage of the medicines through customs 
those people involved in getting the antivenins are the heroes 
of the story he said all i am is the result of an accident 
haasts condition started improving after he received the serum from 
california and doctors in the end opted not to use the foreign 
serums 
the night before haast was bitten he and nancy harrell who 
helps direct the lab went to a local steak house for what she 
called anything goes day 
sometimes at the end of the month haast abandons a strict routine 
that includes eating animal protein only on evennumbered days and 
never touching refined sugar this night he consumed four chocolate 
sundaes 
when i let myself go i really let go he said 
the next day harrell said haast was a little hastier than usual 
in his work he was really buzzing around the lab that day she 
said 
he believes his strict regimen which also includes always 
walking up the 11 flights to his condominium helped him overcome 
the vipers venom and to cleanse his system it wasnt until nine 
days after the bite that he ate solid food meantime the snake had 
died of natural causes 
haast first bitten in 1926 says his interest in snakes dates 
back nearly 70 years to when he collected garter snakes out of 
canals in paterson nj 
in miami haasts serpentarium near the highway to the florida 
keys was as much a tourist attraction as a laboratory visitors 
could watch from a glassenclosed amphitheater while haast extracted 
venom from hundreds of different species of snakes 
he and harrell moved the facility to salt lake city in 1984 to 
focus more on research he declines to say just how well the 
business is faring except to say its holding its own 
haast collects venom from each snake about once a week at the 
same time they are fed a highprotein formula he mixes himself 
harrell helps with the feedings feeding and venom collection are 
done at the same time to minimize trauma to the snakes 
nearly 50 years ago haast had a hunch that snake venom may be 
valuable in treating polio and was proved right later he had the 
same feeling about multiple sclerosis and more recently has explored 
the possibility of using venom in the fight against aids 
haast and utah businessman alan glanville have organized aids 
experimental treatment and research in mexico both hesitate to 
discuss the project saying it is in its infancy and the hospitals 
and researchers involved require anonymity 
even after his latest brush with death haast says there is 
little chance he will retire in fact he plans to start giving 
himself booster shots to create an immunity to the species of viper 
that bit him

soldiers and police took over two 
jails and arrested the wardens and 40 guards to thwart a planned 
breakout by 10 people held on drug trafficking charges a police 
chief said saturday 
a special force of 60 soldiers and police took part in the raids 
late friday at a prison and a nearby penal farm in the northern port 
of la ceiba said col rolando valencia a district public security 
administration chief 
valencia told the associated press the government took action 
after authorities were tipped off that 10 hondurans arrested on drug 
trafficking charges were planning a massive jailbreak 
he refused to elaborate on the police tip but he said the 10 
also received special treatment from the wardens and guards 
the prisoners were picked up last week and authorities said they 
were trying to smuggle 26 pounds of cocaine into the united states 
valencia said there was no violence in the operation at la ceiba 
a caribbean port 260 miles north of tegucigalpa he said the force 
arrested the 40 prison guards and the two wardens edgardo cabrera 
and adolfo velasquez 
the action was justified in view of the magnitude of the 
problem it would have caused valencia said the operation was 
also carried out to do away with the corruption that was prevalent 
in these jails in which the wardens apparently were accomplices 
justice minister enrique ortiz colindres ordered the wardens 
fired valencia said 
a special force raided the central penitentiary in tegucigalpa on 
feb 20 after rumors circulated that some of the 1500 inmates 
including a number of suspected drug traffickers planned an escape 
its warden and deputy warden were fired and more than 150 guards 
were arrested 
the remote sparsely populated north coast of honduras has become 
a favorite stop for smuggling south american cocaine into the united 
states 
during the past six years the army located and destroyed more 
than 50 clandestine airstrips which smugglers airplanes used as 
refueling stops 
juan ramon matta a reputed cocaine smuggler escaped from a 
colombian jail in 1986 and established a center of operations in 
honduras until april 1988 when honduran authorities arrested him 
under us pressure 
the deportation of matta to stand trial in the united states set 
off violent demonstrations during which the us consulate in 
tegucigalpa was set afire 
the us district court in pensacola fla last year convicted 
and sentenced matta to three years in prison for a 1971 escape from 
a florida prison he is under indictment in three drug trafficking 
cases in california and one in arizona

after two successful space shuttle 
launches intensive tests and examinations of morton thiokols 
redesigned booster rockets have revealed only one minor mystery a 
company spokesman says 
for some reason the metal capture features added to the 
boosters field joints in the wake of the 1986 challenger disaster 
have exhibited small scratches said morton thiokol spokesman rocky 
raab 
however raab said in an interview from cape canaveral fla 
that the scratches also called fretting pose no threat to 
flight safety and the aerospace manufacturer is convinced its 
booster really is the best rocket motor ever made 
as in the past two flights the twin solidfuel boosters that are 
scheduled to hurtle discovery skyward on monday carry special 
instruments to track every nuance of their twominute performance 
the instruments modified versions of the kind used on six 
fullscale booster testfirings at morton thiokols wasatch 
operations in northern utah are intended to record the actual 
flight environment to compare with the test environment raab said 
thats to ensure that the tests are accurate for predicting 
flights and that no unexpected phenomena occur he said 
raab said that except for the scratches which did not occur 
during the testfirings and the harmless loss of small pieces of 
cork insulation on the earlier flights there appear to be none 
the capture feature consists of a metaltometal lip that helps 
hold the joint together under the intense stress of firing 
raab said engineers have speculated the scratches may have been 
caused by wave action in the ocean where the boosters fall after 
spending their propellant and are towed to land by ships 
he said that while safety isnt an issue if the scratches 
occurred at that point the reusability of the rocket casings may 
be the cases are designed to be used repeatedly 
its not clear yet raab said the bad news is that because 
we dont understand it weve proposed to nasa that we put 
instruments on the towback to record what happens but they havent 
funded that yet 
the capture feature the only metaltometal part of the 
redesigned field joint was one of scores of changes to the 
boosters three field joints to ensure that no superheated gas 
escapes as it did in the challenger explosion 
a presidential commission found that a faulty joint allowed a 
plume of gas to escape triggering the blast that destroyed 
challenger killed its seven astronauts and grounded the nations 
manned space flight program for more than 2 years 
investigators determined that subfreezing temperatures before the 
doomed launch stiffened an oring seal causing it to lose 
pliability and contributing to the failure 
the redesign project was estimated to have cost well over 500 
million and equipping the first three flight rockets with 
instruments to measure temperatures pressures stresses motion and 
vibration has cost at least 3 million raab said 
he said that over the next several months morton thiokol 
analysts will compile the information gathered on the boosters then 
turn it over to the national aeronautics and space administration 
nasa in turn will make the decisions on what if any changes 
should be made raab said 
morton thiokol is betting that the redesigned motor will retain 
nasas favor despite the agencys call for industry proposals for a 
new generation of advanced shuttle rocket motors 
several aerospace companies including utahs hercules aerospace 
have submitted proposals and nasa is to announce its decision later 
this month

the eastern airlines saga a 60year story of a 
carrier that world war i flying ace eddie rickenbacker helped make 
soar but apollo 8 astronaut frank borman couldnt keep out of a 
tailspin is in chapter 11 
an unhappy ending is likely with management blaming suicidal 
unions who say corporate head frank lorenzo wants to kill organized 
labor 
most clues to the case of whos killing eastern airlines point to 
murdersuicide 
at easterns headquarters a towering fountain in tribute to 
rickenbacker today is guarded by doublestacked razorsharp 
concertina wire while strikers on the other side of a fence topped 
with more barbed wire chant hey hey ho ho lorenzos got to 
go 
inside handfuls of management employees rush through quiet halls 
past darkened offices as they struggle to maintain a skeleton 
schedule during a crippling strike 
this is the airline that once boasted of flying more passengers 
than any carrier other than the soviets aeroflot and was the 
nations seventhlargest until nearly all union employees walked out 
march 4 leading to thursdays filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization 
although texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo and eastern 
president phil bakes say eastern will be rebuilt unions will fight 
them with their own reorganization plan and continue seeking a 
buyout 
the unions say eastern is under deadly assault by lorenzo who 
brought a unionbusting reputation to the company three years ago 
and a takeitorloseyourjob management style to a company 
with some of the industrys strongestwilled unions 
massive concessions were demanded firings suspensions and 
grievances skyrocketed assets were spun off or sold mostly to the 
benefit of lorenzos parent texas air and complex loans and 
longterm notes from eastern made it appear the carrier was helping 
subsidize lorenzos nonunion continental airlines 
charged with what management calls economic suicide are the 
unions particularly the pilots few were surprised that the 
machinists unions 17month contract dispute and refusal to make 
more concessions ended in strike but management was stunned when 
nearly all 3600 pilots refused to cross picket lines 
the pilots union remembered that lorenzo used pilots to keep 
continental flying during a machinists strike in 1983 but that the 
pilots too lost their contracts in bankruptcy reorganization 
leading the machinists is fiery district 100 president charles e 
bryan with a stubborness born of studies of zen yoga gandhi and 
martin luther king jr and a view of the conflict as that between 
good and evil 
charlie is like one of those birthday candles that you blow out 
and it comes back on former company negotiator jack johnson once 
said 
borman recently compared bryan to cult leader jim jones who led 
the 1978 mass suicide in guyana and says he has a certifiably 
insane dream of running the airline himself 
easterns history has been a long rollercoaster 
it was born may 1 1928 as pitcairn aviation a mail carrier 
that made its first miami landing dec 1 it began passenger service 
in 1930 and was renamed eastern in 1938 
the carrier was losing money in 1935 when rickenbacker climbed 
aboard using his warhero status and forceful personality to build 
eastern into a giant force in the industry 
eastern became the dominant northsouth carrier east of the 
mississippi and boomed when postworld war ii prosperity brought 
leisure time to most americans 
national airlines introduced jets to commercial aviation in 1958 
but rickenbacker didnt believe they would work for carrying 
passengers 
by the time he left eastern in 1963 the company was losing money 
and had become known for benign neglect of passengers some of whom 
formed the we hate eastern airlines club 
borman became president and chief executive in 1975 after the 
company lost a thenstaggering 53 million in 1973 
as with rickenbacker borman capitalized on his hero status and 
brought a new style of pride and dedication in 1976 he persuaded 
his unions to accept a wage freeze 
a 1976 profit led to a fiveyear variable earnings program the 
company held 35 percent of the workers earnings but if profits 
were made the workers would get that 35 percent back plus an 
additional 35 percent 
the first two years brought employees nice christmas checks but 
then came airline deregulation and stronger competition borman 
countered by buying more planes expanding service going deeper in 
debt 
bryan became the machinists leader in 1980 after attacking the 
vep the company unilaterally extended the program by a year 
leading to a 1983 showdown in which borman on the day of a strike 
deadline gave the machinists 32 percent raises he said eastern 
couldnt afford 
borman gave the unions seats on the board of directors and 
replaced the vep with a stockforpay program that allowed employees 
to acquire 25 percent of eastern stock 
by early 1986 bryan was urging a full employee takeover 
management fought back by demanding concessions the pilots and 
flight attendants agreed to 20 percent cuts 
bryan refused to make concessions unless borman left the board 
refused to allow bryan to dictate to it and sold out to lorenzo on 
feb 23 1986 
the next day lorenzo said there aint no santa claus 
employees lost voting shares in the transaction and their seats 
on the board 
lorenzos management called for nearly 30 percent in cuts from 
unions that had been giving back wages for much of the past 10 
years it made no bones about its plans if eastern couldnt be 
fixed the way management wanted it would be tanked 
the unions decided to take their chances 
so here we are reflected james ashlock an eastern spokesman 
or lobbyist for 22 years at least now maybe we have a chance to 
rebuild it right

vatican city us roman catholic leaders ended a special 
meeting with the pope saturday acknowledging differences with the 
vatican but predicting the session wont change the shape of the 
american catholic church 
this was not the bad schoolboys being called home to be 
disciplined by their father archbishop daniel pilarczyk of 
cincinnati declared 
pope john paul ii called the extraordinary meeting to discuss how 
bishops can spread catholic teaching in an american society strongly 
influenced by such secular trends as divorce sexual promiscuity and 
materialism 
because of the united states worldwide influence the vatican 
sees it as a battleground on which the church can win or lose its 
fight against these trends 
during four days of meetings vatican cardinals urged the 35 
bishops to assert church teachings more vigorously and bring their 
often independentminded flock into line 
echoing those conclusions the pope told the bishops gathered 
saturday in an underground stone hall 
we are guardians of something given and given to the church 
universal something which is not the result of reflection however 
competent on cultural and social questions of the day and is not 
merely the best path among many but the one and only path to 
salvation 
some us bishops responded that catholic teachings only can 
flourish when they take into account a society shaped by democracy 
and giveandtake 
surely there are differences cardinal joseph bernardin of 
chicago said in a report summing up the talks but these 
differences stem from a single burning desire to teach and 
evangelize in the most effective way possible given the cultural 
and societal realities of our time 
speaking for the bishops he called for clarification on how much 
dissent can be allowed and said compromise sometimes is needed to 
remain in the public debate and influence public morality 
bernardin also suggested establishing a commission to increase 
catholic influence over segments of american culture including the 
media art entertainment and economics 
he said the bishops additionally feel an urgent need for a 
theological critique of radical feminism elaborating cardinal 
bernard law of boston inal antonio innocenti the prefect of the vaticans 
congregation for the clergy criticized some women for asking to be 
priests which the church considers a role only for men 
there can be suspicions that this desire is fed more by the 
search for power than the idea of service he told reporters 
despite the americans recommendations and strong words from the 
vatican the bishops indicated they expect little concrete change 
soon because of the meeting 
i dont think it will change the shape of the american catholic 
church said pilarczyk 
for the vatican innocenti said he thought the meeting was a 
great step foward in unifying the church 
vatican and us church leaders appear to remain apart on several 
issues 
for example vatican officials placed heavy emphasis on 
artificial birth control while bernardin and other us bishops 
barely touched the subject large numbers of american catholics 
ignore the churchs ban on artificial contraception 
i would say that the issue has been dealt with implicitly 
in the many times we looked at cultural factors which inhibit 
acceptance of and living out of faith law said 
while the vatican questioned the us annulment process and said 
it seemed too many marriages are being annulled the american 
bishops defended their tribunals law said he foresaw no changes in 
the process 
however there also was debate among the american prelates 
reflecting divisions within the us church american bishops 
differed among themselves on such issues as the value of general 
confession of sins and the degree to which compromise is 
permissible to adapt church teachings to us society

they say a second attempt is forthcoming but the actors arent 
sure when 
we were headed for the church but ran out of gas miss 
fawcett says of an attempt to wed during a vacation three years ago 
it was a blizzard and no one would stop for us it took hours to 
get back to a warm place and by that time we were no longer in the 
wedding mood 
the couple met 10 years ago while miss fawcett was wife of the 
six million dollar man actor lee majors

an iranian envoy has been dispatched to 
encourage other moslem nations to support irans position on the 
novel the satanic verses at a conference this week according to 
news reports saturday 
in england home of the novels author salman rushdie moslems 
staged demonstrations in two cities 
irans official islamic republic news agency reported that 
parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani said during an audience with 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the controversy over the book was 
helping export the islamic revolution 
khomeini did not speak during the meeting at a mosque in a tehran 
suburb said irna monitored in nicosia 
irna said ayatollah ahmed jannati a special envoy was touring 
moslem states in the region to try to forge a united front on the 
issue at the organization of islamic conference meeting scheduled to 
begin monday in saudi arabia 
pakistani foreign minister sahabzada yaqub khan said in a meeting 
with his iranian counterpart ali akbar velayati that he hoped the 
oic will take a decisive stand to condemn the book irna 
reported 
observers expect a showdown between the majority sunni and the 
minority shiite moslems over the issue 
there are 100 million shiites among the worlds estimated 1 
billion moslems more than half the shiites live in iran which has 
called on moslems to kill rushdie 
many moslems say the satanic verses blasphemes islam by 
portraying the prophet mohammeds wives as prostitutes and 
suggesting mohammed wrote the koran rather than receiving it from 
god 
most nations in the middle east have banned the book as have 
asian countries with large moslem populations 
at least 19 people have been killed in india and pakistan in 
riots over the novel 
rushdie a naturalized british citizen born to a moslem family in 
india went into hiding after khomeini issued his death threat last 
month and iranian religious leaders put a 52 million bounty on his 
head 
iran broke diplomatic relations with britain on march 7 over its 
refusal to suppress the novel 
on saturday 2000 moslems marched five miles through the town of 
slough west of london and burned an effigy of rushdie 
dozens of police officers escorted the marchers and lines of 
officers stood guard outside bookshops police said the march was 
peaceful and there were no arrests 
busloads of protesters from around the english midlands converged 
on the central england town of leicester and about 5000 marched 
three miles through the city center 
police stopped the protesters from burning an effigy of rushdie 
no one was arrested

in a major report certain to 
stir controversy a governmentappointed commission called saturday 
for an end to all apartheid laws and the creation of voting rights 
for the black majority 
the south african law commission said all attempts at race reform 
were unlikely to succeed unless the government allows the countrys 
28 million blacks to participate fully in national elections 
the commissions report was released one day after the main 
afrikaner church declared for the first time that apartheid is a 
sin the dutch reformed church which includes president pw botha 
and virtually his entire cabinet as congregants also expressed 
guilt for its role in supporting apartheid 
the commission report was the first time a government body called 
for black voting rights although individuals in government have 
made similar statements on occasion 
the commission was appointed by justice minister kobie coetsee in 
1986 and includes officials in the justice department as well as 
some of the countrys senior judges and legal scholars 
the government had no immediate comment on the report 
south africa should draw up a new constitution that guarantees 
individual rights but expressly prohibits racebased group 
rights the report said 
a bill of rights should ban all forms of discrimination include 
the right to appear in court after being arrested and guarantee the 
rights to peaceful protest and participation in political 
organizations the commission said 
under south africas apartheid policies of racial segregation 
the countrys 5 million whites maintain economic and political 
control over the 28 million blacks 
also the governments 33monthold state of emergency allows 
authorities to detain people indefinitely without charge most forms 
of peaceful protest are banned or restricted under the emergency 
regulations 
botha has said repeatedly he will not even discuss the 
possibility of a black majority government he also has said he is 
committed to segregated schools and neighborhoods 
botha is recovering from a stroke suffered jan 18 his heir 
apparent education minister fw de klerk has been depicted as 
more flexible but he appears to agree with botha on most major 
policy issues and his given no indication he would introduce radical 
change 
however the law commission report repeatedly stressed the 
importance of universal franchise to break the political deadlock 
a bill of rights will not be accepted as legitimate if the 
black people in south africa are not given the vote the 
commission said the right to vote is one of the fundamental human 
rights that must be enshrined in any constitution 
the commission said before a new constitution is drawn up the 
present statute book should be purged of discriminatory legislation 
the report cited several legal obstacles to reform 
the countrys 1983 constitution which includes separate houses 
of parliament for whites people of mixed race and people of asian 
descent but not for blacks 
the population registration act which requires all people to be 
classified by race 
the group areas act which segregates neighborhoods by race 
security legislation that allows for detention without trial

the student artist who enraged veterans by placing 
a flag on the floor of the school of the art institute said saturday 
that the exhibit is a revolutionary statement and he has no 
apologies 
flanked by members of the revolutionary communist party artist 
dread scott tyler said the exhibit titled what is the proper 
way to display a us flag has gone beyond the issue of free 
speech to that of race and revolution 
i hope it will represent the hopes and inspirations of the 
oppressed minorities both here and internationally said tyler 
wearing a tshirt that bore the logo of the rap group public 
enemy 
tyler called the veterans groups who have protested the exhibit 
racists and rambos and said the flag has been more a symbol of 
the ku klux klan and world imperialism than of minorities 
protests began about week after the exhibit opened feb 17 and 
veterans and others have tried to remove the flag several times but 
a state judge has rejected a lawsuit contending the work desecrates 
the flag and the exhibit remained open saturday 
the flag is part a minority student exhibit and features the flag 
positioned on the floor so that viewers are likely to step on it 
while writing comments in a guest book the exhibit also shows 
photos of flagdraped coffins and south koreans burning the flag 
apparently ayatollah ruhollah khomeini isnt the only one who 
thinks artists deserve a death sentence tyler said referring 
to the iranian leaders condemnation of author salman rushdie for 
the novel the satanic verses 
tyler 24 said he and his mother have received a number of death 
threats he planned to lead a rally of supporters saturday at the 
art institute but backed out fearing for his safety 
at the rally about 30 students surrounded by police barricades 
chanted mandatory patriotism we say no the thought police have 
got to go 
it is not desecrating the symbol by placing it on the floor 
shouted kate donley 16 it is elevating the symbol thats what 
freedom of speech is about 
about the same number of veterans and their supporters also 
surrounded by barricades waved flags and signs asking drivers on 
busy michigan avenue to honk in support of attempts to end the 
display 
the american flag is at stake said dan calin 63 a veteran 
of world war ii freedom of expression yes but not when its our

two dozen nations saturday agreed 
to enlist the united nations as the worlds environmental watchdog 
but decided against arming it with the weapon of economic sanctions 
presidents premiers and ministrylevel officials from 24 
countries signed a document they stressed was a political 
declaration rather than a legally binding commitment 
it agrees to set up a new institutional authority in the 
united nations to develop instruments and define standards to 
combat atmospheric pollution 
the body could take unspecified appropriate measures to 
enforce its decisions the document said 
that phrasing differed from an earlier text giving the united 
nations authority to impose economic sanctions on goods 
produced under conditions with negative impact for the atmosphere 
we should avoid accentuating the idea of penalties dutch 
premier ruud lubbers told reporters 
we stuck to the word measures because we need a good balance 
between measures in terms of penalties and measures in terms of 
assistance to help countries comply with the un rules he said 
the international court of justice the un judicial arm based 
in the hague would be the ultimate authority to settle disputes 
according to the document 
at issue in the gathering was the gradual heating of the earths 
atmosphere known as the greenhouse effect and the depletion of 
the globes protective ozone shield which filters out 
cancercausing radiation from the sun 
what we call for is unprecedented said norways premier gro 
harlem brundtland she organized the conference with lubbers and 
french premier michel rocard 
if we dont begin immediately life on earth will be impossible 
chemically in three centuries time rocard said but if we 
begin immediately we need not panic 
other key figures included king hussein of jordan and presidents 
francois mitterrand of france and hosni mubarak of egypt 
also present for saturdays signing ceremony were chancellor 
helmut kohl of west germany president robert mugabe of zimbabwe 
premier felipe gonzalez of spain and president daniel arap moi of 
kenya 
other signatories are australia brazil canada ivory coast 
hungary india indonesia italy japan malta new zealand 
senegal sweden tunisia and venezuela 
the document said third world countries where pollutionfighting 
measures would be an abnormal or special burden should get 
financial aid 
a western diplomat told the associated press several third world 
nations privately had demanded a blanket guarantee the west would 
shoulder most of the financial burden 
charles secrett a spokesman for the friends of the earth 
environmentalist group said of the gathering theres a real 
danger of political leaders jumping on the environmental bandwagon 
to show how green they are 
earlier this month the 12nation european community agreed to 
phase out by 1999 all production of chlorofluorocarbons the 
chemicals that deplete the ozone layer 
in hong kong on saturday the government of the british colony 
said it is drafting legislation to reduce imports of 
chlorofluorocarbons and ban their production 
many aerosol spray cans and domestic refrigerators contain the 
harmful gases which also are used in the electronics and plastics 
industries

the palestinian uprising cost israel 666 
million in 1988 and nearly wiped out its economic growth and it may 
exact a similar toll this year a cabinet minister was quoted 
saturday as saying 
gad yaacobi blamed the losses on higher military spending 
reduced production and lost tourism and foreign investment 
yaacobi of the leftleaning labor party was economics minister 
until november when he became communications minister 
arab reports said four palestinians were wounded in clashes with 
troops saturday the army confirmed two injuries 
israel radio quoted yaacobi as saying israels 35 billion 
economy grew 1 percent last year instead of a forecasted 25 
percent in 1987 it grew 5 percent 
at the same time the value of goods and services in the occupied 
lands shrunk from 15 billion in 1987 to 12 billion according to 
palestinian economist samir abdullah 
also saturday israel television reported authorities plan 
gradually to reopen the 1200 west bank schools shut for most of 
the 15month uprising 
olivier rafowicz spokesman for the military government said 
they would decide later this week we want to reopen the schools 
but we want to be sure this is not accompanied by violence he 
said in a telephone interview 
defense minister yitzhak rabin meanwhile said palestinian 
leaders have expressed support for his proposal to hold elections in 
the occupied territories to choose a delegation for direct peace 
talks with israel 
i have received hints that the approach i proposed appeals to 
not just a small number of the leading figures among the residents 
of the occupied territories rabin said in an interview israel 
radio broadcast saturday 
his remarks came after leading palestinians rejected the plan 
saying the palestine liberation organization is their sole 
representative and elections only can be held after israel withdraws 
the people here will not elect a leadership to be in 
competition with the plo bethlehem mayor elias freij a political 
moderate said saturday it will only drive a wedge between us and 
our brothers on the outside 
four palestinians including a 12yearold boy were shot and 
wounded in saturday clashes with israeli troops in the gaza strip 
arab hospital officials said the army confirmed two wounded 
since the uprising began dec 8 1987 394 palestinians have been 
killed seventeen israelis have died 
rabin outlined a troop redeployment plan to reduce the burden 
of reserve soldiers by cutting their duties from a maximum of 62 
days a year to 44 days 
in gaza and the west bank regular forces and fewer reserve 
troops will serve in areas known as trouble spots rabin said in 
addition specially trained border police units will take over some 
areas 
the radio interview was broadcast a day after the army shifted 
some troops out of gaza strip refugee camps it marks a shift in 
government policy from emphasizing a widespread army presence to 
using fewer but bettertrained antiriot units 
the redeployment also came as foreign minister moshe arens left 
for a 10day visit to the united states where he is expected to 
encounter pressure to reduce friction in the occupied lands 
rabin denied troops were redeployed to appease the united states 
there is no connection to whether the americans want this or 
not he said

the defense minister was quoted as saying saturday 
that new eastwest talks on cutting conventional weapons and 
increasing european security should spur reductions in strategic and 
chemical weapons 
we hope that the beginning of the vienna negotiations will 
boost the general disarmament process specifically negotiations on 
50 percent cuts in soviet and us strategic weapons and on a 
convention to ban and eliminate chemical weapons the official 
tass news agency quoted defense minister dmitri t yazov as saying 
in an interview 
this process should also involve tactical nuclear weapons and 
naval forces and confidence and securitybuilding measures should 
be extended not only to ground troops but also to the navies and 
independent air force activities he told tass 
the vienna talks between the 16 nations of the north atlantic 
treaty organization and the seven countries of the warsaw pact began 
thursday 
warsaw pact states proposed a reduction of 10 percent to 15 
percent below the lowest level of arms held by either side in the 
first phase of conventional arms reductions soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze has insisted the talks also cover aircraft 
an area in which the soviets contend the west has an advantage 
the western alliance called for extensive cuts in east bloc 
battle tanks artillery and armored troop carriers which it 
considers the key forces that could be used for an invasion or 
surprise attack on western europe 
nato has offered to make smaller cuts in those categories 
the united states and the soviet union agreed in 1987 to 
eliminate their medium and shorterrange nuclear missiles but 
subsequent talks bogged down on a proposed cut in strategic weapons 
the soviet union has said it is eager for progress in that field 
but understands the administration of president bush will need time 
to put together a negotiating position 
yazov said parallel vienna talks on conventional weapons and 
better monitoring facilities to build confidence in europe offer 
the possibility of moving toward durable security in europe on a 
larger scale combining limitations of and reductions in armed 
forces and armaments with more openness with regard to military 
activities under strict control 
both sides in the conventional arms talks have called for tough 
verification measures to ensure the opponent is not cheating

a lawyer was arrested saturday on extortion 
and perjury charges in the july 1988 kidnapping of the elderly wife 
of a multimillionaire former business associate federal authorities 
said 
newton alfred winn 64 of st petersburg fla was arrested in 
a parking lot in de land fla said wayne taylor agent in charge 
of the fbi in mississippi 
taylor said there is no information on the whereabouts of annie 
laurie hearin 72 wife of businessman robert hearin who was 
abducted from the couples jackson home july 26 
no trace of her has been found except for a letter in her 
handwriting postmarked atlanta sent to hearin a couple of weeks 
after her disappearance that urged him to comply with a ransom note 
left when she was abducted 
winn was charged with extortion in connection with the mailing of 
that letter taylor said he also faces charges of lying to a 
federal grand jury on aug 3 when he denied any knowledge of the 
disappearance the agent said 
when asked if winn was a suspect in the actual disappearance of 
mrs hearin taylor would say only that he has been arrested on 
extortion and perjury charges 
we intend to pursue the kidnapping aspect of the investigation 
just as intensely as we ever have he said and the same applies 
to the efforts to locate mrs hearin 
taylor said hearin who did not attend the news conference was 
pleased with the progress made in the case the family which also 
includes two grown children had pleaded for mrs hearins release 
saying she needed medication for a potentially fatal intestinal 
ailment 
winn was held in baker county jail in macclenny fla and was 
scheduled to appear before a federal magistrate in jacksonville 
fla on monday the fbi said authorities say he will then be 
brought to jackson 
he was one of 12 people named in a crudely phrased typewritten 
ransom note found at the hearins home shortly after mrs hearin 
disappeared the note said hearin had wronged the 12 and demanded 
that hearin pay an unspecified amount of money to them 
all of them are current or former franchisers with school 
pictures of mississippi hearin was once its largest stockholder and 
remains on its board of directors the company which takes 
classroom photos sued winn and the other 11 in the early 1980s 
claiming the franchisers owed money from loans materials and film 
processing fees 
the day after getting the letter from his wife urging him to 
comply with the ransom note hearin reportedly paid nearly 1 
million total to the 12 calculating the amounts sent to each based 
on how much was involved in the lawsuits several of the 12 
including winn returned the money taylor said 
after winn was sued by school pictures in 1983 he was ordered to 
pay 153000 after that he and school pictures continued to battle 
in court because he failed to pay the judgment against him 
according to a statement released by the fbi an eviction hearing 
had been scheduled for aug 8 in clearwater fla to remove winn 
from his home and office 
taylor said that the fbi investigators concluded that winn paid a 
woman friend to mail a letter for him outside the state of florida 
the woman had been misled about what the letter contained and was 
not arrested he said 
hearins worth reportedly exceeds 100 million in addition to 
being coowner of mississippi valley gas co he and his partner 
new jersey oil man leon hess own controlling interest in lamar life 
corp a mississippibased insurance company that also has bank 
holdings

operations 
we dont have any significant issues that we are working 
crippen said after a saturday afternoon mission management meeting

calm winds by launch time

labor rallies boosted the spirits of striking 
eastern airlines workers saturday while the struggling carrier 
attracted travelers like gangbusters to its bargain northeast 
shuttle and worked to restore routes 
aircraft were again reported flying near capacity on the second 
day of 12 fares on the northeast shuttle linking new york with 
washington and boston once easterns most profitable service the 
prestrike fare was 99 
the shuttles going like gangbusters said eastern spokesman 
robin matell this 12 fare has just created a tremendous 
groundswell of interest in traveling between the cities 
joe scott an eastern spokesman in new york said the shuttle 
remained popular saturday but ticket lines at laguardia airport 
were not as long as they were friday 
many flights were crowded with college students heading home for 
spring break because the hourly shuttle works on a firstcome 
firstserve basis many passengers waited for hours before getting 
on a flight 
matell suggested the solidarity of pilots honoring machinists 
union picket lines might be cracking we have more than 200 pilots 
now and yesterday we had inquiries from about 300 pilots inquiring 
about procedures for returning to work he said 
but air line pilots association spokesman jim bost an eastern 
pilot for four years discounted that report saying so far they 
are still hanging tight with us as far as we can tell the line is 
still holding solid 
machinists leader frank ortis said the pickets resolve was 
unwavering despite urgings from eastern to return to work 
management is calling people to go to work saying its all 
over ortis said this is company rhetoric and were telling 
members disregard that were still on strike 
meanwhile corporate shuffling by eastern parent texas air corp 
continued as eastern express a nonunion commuter carrier that fed 
eastern flights was renamed continental express nonunion 
continental airlines another texas air company has picked up some 
eastern routes since the strike began march 4

jesse jackson joined machinists pilots and flight attendants on 
picket lines for about 10 minutes donning pilots caps shaking 
hands and kissing babies about 1000 people attended a related 
rally 
i intend to march until victory is won said jackson who got 
a rousing reaction thursday from eastern strikers in miami i 
dont know of any airplanes that fly in reverse 
ed weiss an eastern pilot for 10 years was among about 200 
people who linked hands along the main service road at the greater 
buffalo ny international airport in a gesture of labor unity 
were out to show the public that we are firm and standing 
strong and we will prevail weiss said 
the aflcio announced saturday in washington the establishment of 
a relief fund to help union members at eastern and said it reached 
250000 almost immediately it started with an aflcio contribution 
of 100000 followed by 50000 from the united auto workers and 
100000 from the american federation of state county and municipal 
employees 
aflcio president lane kirkland sent a letter to other affiliated 
unions and state and local federations seeking contributions to what 
was named the fairness at eastern fund 
in miami striking employees were joined by their families for 
picket duty at eastern headquarters and a food drive was organized 
for union members who are ineligible for unemployment under florida 
law because they went on strike rather than agree to contract 
concessions 
i know some people are really hurting as far as paychecks but 
we all knew this was going to happen said mechanic les davison 
picketing with his 6yearold daughter christina who sported an 
antifrank lorenzo sticker targeting texas airs chairman on her 
frilly pink dress 
terry cullen a veteran flight attendant picketing with her 
husband and 5yearold daughter said their creditors have been 
understanding 
almost everybody ive talked to when they hear eastern says 
well sit down and work with you mrs cullen said 
after being all but shut down at the beginning of the weekold 
strike eastern was preparing to resume 40 roundtrip flights sunday 
and monday including service to 13 latin american cities from miami 
well just play it slowly and conservatively and see how the 
operation is going and add in increments matell said 
the machinists union was drafting its legal response to easterns 
chapter 11 financial reorganization petition filed thursday at us 
bankruptcy court in new york 
under that filing paychecks for all but the carriers 1500 
remaining employees have been held up the 8500 machinists were 
scheduled to be paid friday 
machinists attorney robert clayman said documents would be filed 
soon at the court to correct the pay situation and make sure these 
employees get paid as quickly as possible 
workers suffered fresh blows friday when eastern confirmed that 
medical coverage had been suspended for 600 workers and at least 
four south florida store chains refused to accept checks drawn on 
the eastern airlines federal credit union which is unaffected by 
the strike 
officials at the credit union which has 875 million in assets 
reported withdrawals have been slightly above normal of 135000 
members 30000 are eastern workers 
my husband told me to get all my money and put it in a bank

a maverick communist leader said saturday that just 
four men decided to send troops into afghanistan president leonid 
brezhnev defense minister dmitri ustinov foreign minister andrei 
gromyko and politburo ideologist michael suslov 
it has long been reported that only a handful of members of the 
ruling politburo were involved in the fateful decision that sent 
15000 soviet soldiers to their deaths in afghanistan 
but boris yeltsin a former candidate member of the politburo who 
was demoted from moscow communist party chief after criticizing the 
leadership was the first official to name the individuals 
yeltsins revelation came in a speech saturday before 800 people 
at the kuntsevo theater where he was campaigning for the new 
congress of peoples deputies he did not give his source but he 
likely would have been one of the first let in on the secret he 
remains one of the 300odd members of the communist partys 
policymaking central committee 
other members of the central committee said last year they did 
not know who was responsible but the subject suddenly was opened to 
discussion in february when the soviet troops left afghanistan after 
nine years of war 
the four men yeltsin identified were all top kremlin power 
brokers in 1979 and likely candidates for a coterie closeknit and 
powerful enough to make such a drastic decision 
brezhnev then 73 held the top positions in both the government 
and the communist party president and party general secretary 
gromyko then 70 had ruled the foreign ministry for 22 years 
gen ustinov then 71 was both minister of defense and marshal 
of the army and suslov then 77 was the politburo member in charge 
of ideology who took on a number of brezhnevs duties in 1979 
gromyko retired from the presidency and the politburo last 
autumn brezhnev and suslov died in 1982 and ustinov died in 1984 
the communist party daily pravda raised official doubts about the 
wisdom of intervening in afghanistan in a frontpage article feb 
15 the day the last soviet soldier came home 
it is possible to doubt the brezhnev leaderships evaluation of 
the level of military threat pravda said such vitally 
important decisions as the use of troops cannot be decided secretly 
by a small circle of people without the sanction of the 
parliament 
yeltsin said saturday that brezhnev gromyko ustinov and suslov 
made the fateful decision and then told the politburo 
the politburo is the ruling body in the soviet communist partys 
oligarchy and its members then 14 would have been expected to 
take such an important step as a group 
if the people had decided there would have been a different 
decision yeltsin said in explaining his campaign call for a 
referendum law in the soviet union instead 15000 soviet soldiers 
died and in the end the soviet union didnt win the war he said 
yeltsin was ousted as moscow communist party leader in 1987 after 
his harsh attacks on corruption angered too many people he is now 
first deputy chairman of the state construction committee 
yeltsin is running against the director of a moscow auto factory 
in the first multicandidate national elections in soviet history 
he called for more rapid economic reform and cancellation of all 
privileges enjoyed by the elite particularly access to hardtofind 
goods and services 
if we lack something then workers government ministers and 
the general secretary should lack the same things he said to loud 
applause

police arrested a retired merchant who 
allegedly threatened to blow up the poet dantes tomb but the man 
said his threatening letters were just a joke police said saturday 
a police investigator speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the letters from the man in ravenna threatened to blow up the tomb 
because dante supposedly blasphemed the prophet mohammed in his 
classic divine comedy written more than 650 years ago 
the retired merchant arrested thursday admitted writing the 
threatening letters only as a joke and had no idea all this fuss 
would have been created the police official said 
police were posted at the tomb after ravenna mayor mauro dragone 
and a newspaper received letters last week attributed to a group 
called guardians of the revolution 
the writer of the letters said dante in his classic divine 
comedy placed the founder of islam in hell 
the police investigator identified the merchant as vincenzo 
strocchi a selfstyled dante scholar and said authorities have not 
decided whether to charge him 
the letter to the mayor demanded that dragone publicly announce 
that dante lied about mohammed and that divine comedy revered 
as the most magnificent poetic creation in the italian language 
should not be studied or read 
dantes epic a work of more than 14000 lines in 100 cantos 
recounts a poets journey through hell purgatory and heaven it 
places mohammed in the ninth pit of hell 
the threats to blow up dantes tomb sparked a furor in ravenna 
because of the recent death threats made against british author 
salman rushdie whose novel the satanic verses makes references 
to islam and mohammed that moslems call blasphemous 
iranian clerics have called for rushdies death and have placed a 
52 million reward on his head

atan maywin stood under the harsh sun in 
front of her makeshift hut saturday describing how her six children 
died from starvation and disease as they fled the civil war in 
southern sudan 
she arrived in this town 460 miles southwest of the capital of 
khartom on thursday one of about 300 refugees who enter muglad 
daily seeking safety and food 
hundreds of thousands of refugees have fled battle areas and an 
international relief program under united nations auspices hopes to 
transport 170000 tons of food and supplies to distribution points 
before the rainy season starts in may 
but there has been no agreement between relief organizers and 
leaders of the rebels sudan peoples liberation army spla on 
shipments of the supplies in previous years spla forces have fired 
at planes and trucks carrying relief supplies saying the army was 
using them to transport equipment to its troops 
there are some 225 million people in southern sudan last year 
it is estimated that as many as 500000 perished from warrelated 
causes with many starving in isolated villages 
james grant executive director of the un childrens fund 
unicef returned to khartoum saturday after a day of talks with 
spla leaders in the ethiopian capital of addis ababa 
grant said gen lon akol the splas second in command asked for 
time to study a proposed month of tranquility which would 
virtually amount to a ceasefire to move relief supplies into 
position 
grant spoke with reporters after meeting prime minister sadek 
mahdi and informing him about the talks with the rebels mahdis 
government has accepted the relief plan 
the spla took a strong position that there was a need for food 
and that they would work to get it to their people grant said 
we have yet to receive a formal reply 
we are going to work with the assumption that we will get 
agreement if not on a month of tranquility then at the very least 
on bubbles of tranquility for the eight points in the plan he 
said 
the eight points involve transporting aid by airlifts and truck 
train and barge convoys to both government and rebelheld areas 
in addis ababa an spla official speaking on condition he not be 
identified said no agreement had been reached on a ceasefire to 
allow relief shipments into the south 
the official commented on the meeting with grant julia taft 
head of the us office of foreign disasters assistance and 
representatives of western donor agencies 
we discussed with them recent developments in sudan but we did 
not reach any conclusive agreement the official said the spla 
has its headquarters in addis ababa 
un officials have estimated that 100000 people might perish if 
the month of tranquility operation cannot be carried out other 
officials have said the death toll could exceed 600000 
the sudanese government is dominated by moslems and has imposed 
islamic law while many people in the south are christians and 
animists the spla took up arms against the government in 1985 
demanding autonomy and a larger share for the south of sudans 
wealth and development

the main church of ruling 
afrikaners has declared apartheid a sin and asked forgiveness for 
its long support of the racially discriminatory system 
we confess with humility and sorrow the participation of our 
church in the introduction and legitimation of the ideology of 
apartheid and the subsequent suffering of people said the white 
dutch reformed church 
the black and mixedrace dutch reformed churches welcomed the 
most explicit condemnation of apartheid made by their white mother 
church but said it also must work to destroy the system it helped 
create 
president pw botha and virtually his entire cabinet are among 
congregants of the repenting church which probably is 
afrikanerdoms strongest single unifying factor 
there was no immediate reaction from the government to the 
churchs declaration or to a governmentappointed commissions 
report saturday that called for voting rights for the black majority 
and an end to all apartheid laws 
the government has said repeatedly that it is dismantling 
apartheid and wants to move away from discriminatory legislation 
however botha has repeatedly refused to even discuss the 
possibility of a black majority government and says he is committed 
to segregated schools and neighborhoods for whites 
the white church made its statement late friday after a weeklong 
meeting between white black and mixedrace church leaders in 
vereeniging 38 miles south of johannesburg 
apartheid cannot be accepted on christian ethical grounds 
because it contravenes the very essence of reconciliation 
neighborly love and righteousness the white church said 
the black and mixedrace delegation said it is encouraging 
that there are ministers in the white drc that call for fundamental 
and comprehensive changes but it is vital that they should embark 
on acts of liberation within church and society 
among the black and mixedrace leaders were some of the countrys 
bestknown antiapartheid figures such as the rev allan boesak and 
the rev beyers naude one of the few white ministers who belongs to 
the black church 
they called on the white church to condemn specific 
discriminatory laws and develop a theology counteracting 
apartheid they also issued a document promoting civil 
disobedience which the white church did not endorse 
one cannot be a christian and not resist apartheid the 
document said resistance to this evil system is both the calling 
and duty of the church 
piet rossouw a top official in the white church said saturday 
its leaders would address such issues at a meeting this week 
the important thing is that we are working together to address 
the problem of discrimination and suffering rossouw said 
with about 1 million adult members the white dutch reformed 
church is by far the largest and most influential church among 
afrikaners who make up 3 million of the countrys 5 million whites 
the church opposes political activism but is in close contact with 
the government behind the scenes 
johan heyns leader of the white church told the associated 
press late last year he recently had spoken to botha about sensitive 
political issues including the possible release of imprisoned black 
leader nelson mandela 
in 1986 the church reversed its decadesold support of 
segregation and said apartheid was a mistake but it stopped short 
of calling it a sin or heresy 
at the same time it opened membership to all races but most 
churches remain segregated because of tradition about 50 ministers 
and 30000 congregants who believe in strict segregation have broken 
away from the white church in the past three years 
the dutch reformed church provided the scriptural justification 
for apartheid when the governing national party came to power in 
1948 and began codifying racial segregation df malan the prime 
minister from 194854 when most apartheid laws were enacted was a 
minister in the church 
over the years church leaders cited dozens of biblical passages 
they said supported apartheid under which the black majority has no 
voice in national affairs they argued biblical references to 
peoples and nations supported policies to preserve cultural 
identity and the right way to do this was to divide different races 
into their separate nations 
about 11 million of the nations 28 million blacks belong to the 
black dutch reformed church and 680000 of the 3 million mixedrace 
people belong to their dutch reformed church 
also saturday blacks planning a sitin at a whitesonly park in 
carletonville 45 miles west of johannesburg canceled the protest 
after police warned organizers they would be held responsible if any 
trouble broke out 
blacks in carletonville have been protesting a recent town 
council decision to resegregate public facilities that had been 
integrated

whats in a name well that depends on 
whether you consider yourself michigander a michiganite a 
michiganian or maybe even a bit michiganer 
abraham lincoln is said to have coined michigander in 1848 in 
a sarcastic speech state archivists have found one 1800s reference 
to michiganite an 1871 pamphlet referred to michiganer 
the associated press in michigan uses michiganian the 
detroit free press after some energetic writers conducted a poll 
endorsed michigander and included it in its stylebook for 
writers 
state government skirts the issue roger peters of the 
legislative service bureau said drafting experts have no policy and 
tend to avoid the matter 
in 1981 the state house debated the matter defeating 
michigander 5142 and selecting michiganian for official use but 
the senate never passed the measure 
the only official reference experts could uncover was a 1980 law 
creating a state commission to serve the aging it included the 
title this act shall be known and may be cited as the older 
michiganian act 
that absent a counterattack from gander backers apparently 
has carried the day 
technically i think michiganian is preferred said david 
anderson professor of american thought and language at michigan 
state university youre not from michigand youre from michigan 
michigander adds something that doesnt belong 
but he added its not one of the pressing problems michigan 
has to solve

foreign ministry spokesman eugenio castro said in a telephone 
interview the meeting will be held monday and tuesday he refused to 
give further details 
officials in washington could not be reached immediately for 
comment 
in february the presidents of nicaragua el salvador guatemala 
honduras and costa rica agreed to the peace proposal which includes 
freeing hundreds of former nicaraguan national guardsmen and free 
and open elections in that country 
as part of the agreement the leaders said they would draft a 
plan by may 15 to disband the 11000member rebel force fighting 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government 
most of the rebels known as contras fled to border bases in 
honduras after us military assistance ended last year 
the sandinistas and the contras signed a provisional truce in 
march 1988 
castro said two senior diplomats and two army colonels will 
represent the honduran government at the washington talks he said 
contra leaders adolfo calero aristides sanchez roberto ferrey and 
enrique bermudez will represent the rebels 
honduras has reluctantly tolerated contras in its territory since 
1981 when the rebels with us assistance started battling the 
sandinistas 
the presence of rebel supply and training bases along the border 
with nicaragua has soured relations between the two countries and 
there have been frequent clashes between soldiers from the two sides 
on saturday the nicaraguan defense ministry accused honduran 
troops of attacking the nicaraguan border post of murupuchi 110 
miles north of managua the nicaraguan capital it said the post was 
attacked 13 times in february and this was the sixth in march 
a defense ministry news release in managua said honduran troops 
opened fire on the post with automatic weapons and mortars but did 
not say when the attack took place or give other details 
there was no immediate public response from the honduran 
government 
as part of the peace initiative the sandinista government said 
friday it will free this month 1984 former members of ousted 
president anastasio somozas national guard 
nicaraguan security chief lenin cerna said the guardsmen will be 
freed after the national assembly formally approves a pardon request 
from president daniel ortega 
cerna said the guadsmen who were jailed after the sandinistas 
overthrew somoza in a 1979 revolution will be free to leave the 
country

just four days before communist party leaders are 
to revamp agricultural policy mikhail gorbachevs strongest rival 
on the politburo on saturday publicly broke with the presidents 
call for more individual farming 
yegor ligachev the head of the communist partys commission on 
agriculture characterized his preference for collective farming as 
a group decision without identifying who supports him 
ligachev the former ideology chief of the communist party who 
was shifted to agriculture last fall in what was widely regarded as 
a demotion was interviewed on soviet television during a trip to 
view agriculture in czechoslovakia 
we have become convinced one more time that the basis for any 
progress in food programs is actually development of collective 
forms of management such as collective farms and state farms along 
with a steady development of selffinancing or accounting for 
profits and losses ligachev said 
such accounting is a major part of gorbachevs reform program 
however ligachev did not mention gorbachevs repeated praise for 
experiments in leasing state farm land to families and small groups 
just last week premier nikolai i ryzhkov told a news conference 
that the kremlin leaders intended to significantly expand family 
farming through leasing of land 
although ligachev was appointed by gorbachev he has differed 
with the soviet leader on a number of occasions 
czechoslovakias agriculture is almost entirely collectivized but 
operates under a much more flexible system than soviet farms 
the soviet communist partys central committee the policymaking 
body of about 300 people is scheduled to meet wednesday to enact 
drastic reforms in soviet agriculture although bread is in 
plentiful supply the country is suffering serious food shortages 
with meat cheese and sugar rationed in many cities 
there has been evidence in recent weeks that the kremlin 
leadership is finding it difficult to agree on agricultural reform 
the central committee meeting was postponed from february into the 
beginning of plowing season last week the 12member politburos 
meeting covered agricultural reform among other items and ran for 
two days instead of the usual one 
the central committee which meets irregularly only a few times a 
year is the only body with the power to change the leadership of 
the communist party

anticommunist insurgents and afghan government forces holding a 
strategic city has killed scores of people and wounded hundreds a 
guerrilla spokesman said saturday 
thousands of guerrillas blasted jalalabad in a relentless attack 
with longrange rockets and heavy artillery said mohammad shoaib of 
the jamiateislami insurgent group 
the city afghanistans fifthlargest is seen by the guerrillas 
as a stepping stone to the capital of kabul 75 miles to the west 
fighting is close to and around the city said shoaib 
there are rumors that some mujahedeen guerrillas have entered 
the city from the north but there is no confirmation 
several guerrilla sources said the insurgents now control a key 
government garrison on the outskirts of jalalabad which is 45 miles 
west of the border with pakistan where many guerrilla groups are 
based 
the guerrillas captured as many as 500 government troops in the 
battle for the post said naeem majrooh of the afghan information 
center which opposes the marxist government 
majrooh said casualty figures are very high most of the deaths 
are from mines and bombardments 
the government of afghan president najib said 1500 guerrillas 
had been killed in the weeklong fighting around jalalabad it did 
not give figures for government forces 
the official soviet news agency tass said afghan government 
forces in jalalabad attacked the rebels with bomb strikes and 
rockets killing 350 insurgents and wounding 200 it said government 
units suffered 15 killed and 12 wounded

kabul with arms ammunition and reinforcements 
western journalists returning from the afghanpakistani border 
said a convoy of ambulances was headed for pakistan

saturday in a speech that only four men made the fateful decision to 
send soviet troops into afghanistan president leonid brezhnev 
defense minister dmitri ustinov foreign minister andrei gromyko and 
politburo ideologist michael suslov 
yeltsin who was demoted from moscow party chief after 
criticizing the party leadership was the first official to name the 
individuals involved in the decision which led to the deaths of 
15000 soviet troops it had long been believed that only a few top 
officials were involved 
the guerrillas have been fighting the government since a marxist 
coup in 1978 and have vowed to overthrow najib now that the soviets 
are gone 
they recently formed an interim government and on friday held 
their first cabinet meeting inside afghanistan about seven miles 
from the border in eastern paktia province

federal agents with brooms and metal detectors 
focused saturday on the burnedout wreckage of a van driven by the 
wife of the navy captain who mistakenly ordered the destruction of 
an iranian passenger jet 
officials said the case was being investigated as a possible 
terrorist attack 
the home of capt will rogers iii commander of the uss 
vincennes was sealed off and he and his wife sharon were in 
hiding officials confirmed the couple received at least one 
threatening call about the missile strike on the airliner 
the van remained in the cordonedoff intersection where it 
exploded and burned friday moments after mrs rogers got out when 
she heard a noise witnesses described as two loud pops 
there also was increased security at the several military 
facilities in san diego the nations largest navy complex 
the van was the center of intense scrutiny saturday by 
investigators from the fbi and other federal agencies who had a 
command post set up nearby 
we are into an exhaustive painstaking lengthy investigation 
to determine what type of bomb it was what was used in it how it 
was detonated said thomas hughes agent in charge of the san 
diego fbi office there are fragments that would lead one to 
believe this was a pipe bomb 
however he said at a briefing saturday that it had still not 
been determined whether it was a pipe bomb 
investigators set up barrels covered with sieves and sifted 
through debris collected from the area shortly after fridays 
explosion other investigators swept beds of plants lining the 
avenue with metal detectors 
the debris will be taken to a lab in washington bomb analysts 
from the los angeles fbi office and the washington fbi explosives 
unit were at the scene 
the roofs of buildings in the area also were being searched for 
any kind of evidence hughes said 
teams of investigators are running out just hundreds and 
hundreds of leads hughes said 
he said the rogerses were being kept in a secure location their 
son who attends school in upstate new york was notified and 
offered protection the fbi said 
hughes declined to comment when asked about a report that a red 
car was seen behind mrs rogers van and made a quick uturn after 
the explosion 
rogers who joined his wife at a nearby police station after the 
bombing had driven the van earlier friday the new york times 
quoted a bush administration official as saying 
the couples home was kept behind a security seal with 
authorities blocking the street so far away that the house was not 
visible to reporters 
three officiallooking vehicles with heavily tinted windows were 
allowed through the barricade saturday 
a justice department source in washington who spoke on condition 
of anonymity said investigators suspect the bombing was the work of 
terrorists however local fbi investigators would not confirm that 
theory 
this could have been perpetrated for some other reason unknown 
at this time hughes cautioned 
when anything like this happens were not going to rule 
terrorism out that perhaps this might be a retribution said fbi 
duty officer kathy kennedy in washington but were going to look 
at all the angles 
irans ayatollah ruhollah khomeini called for an allout war 
against the united states after the iran air passenger plane was 
shot down 
some members of the iranian reolutionary guards have entered the 
united states as students oliver b revell executive assistant 
director of the fbi said earlier in the week he said there was a 
hard core of 200 to 300 iranians who were of concern to his 
agency 
no white house comment was planned until the fbi completes its 
investigation white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
saturday 
president bush was monitoring the news accounts hes concerned 
about it said another white house official who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
fbi spokesman michael kortan said no incidents linked to mideast 
terrorists have occurred in this country since 1983 when fbi 
director william webster said the agency had stopped an attempt by 
iranians to bomb a seattle theater occupied by iranian opponents of 
khomeinis regime seattle mayor charles royer said city police were 
informed of the possibility of a threat but nothing happened 
last july 3 in the persian gulf the guidedmissile cruiser 
vincennes exchanged fire with iranian speedboats 
during the battle an aircraft that rogers thought was an iranian 
f14 fighter appeared on the us warships advanced radar after 
the plane failed to respond to warnings on civilian and military 
channels rogers gave the order to shoot it down 
the aircraft was actually an iranian civilian jet with 290 people 
aboard all aboard were killed 
rogers later said he regretted the deaths but that his decision 
was made in defense of his ship and crew he was backed by the 
reagan administration which also decided to compensate the victims 
families 
mrs rogers received a threatening call last july from someone 
she guessed might have been middle eastern the new york times 
reported saturday quoting an unidentified pentagon official the 
caller gave her the name of an organization that was unfamiliar to 
her and said are you the wife of the murderer frightening mrs 
rogers into hanging up the newspaper said 
the navy found no indication that the named organization existed 
the times said 
an unidentified justice department source told the san diego 
union that rogers and his family received at least two telephoned 
death threats from callers who said they were acting in response to 
the jetliners destruction 
the union said rogers received one of the calls 24 hours before 
the december bombing of a pan am jet over lockerbie scotland there 
has been speculation on whether that bombing was in retaliation for 
the vincennes action 
navy cmdr david dillon acting as a spokesman for the couple 
said mrs rogers received a threatening phone call shortly after the 
airliners destruction 
the vincennes has been at san diego its home port since 
october except for several short training missions chief craig 
huebler spokesman for the san diego naval base said saturday 
he confirmed security was tighter at military installations in 
the area but declined to give specifics 
sen pete wilson rcalif spoke with the rogerses on friday 
mrs rogers said thank god this did not happen on thursday 
because she was carrying six children in the van that morning she 
teaches fourth grade at la jolla country day school

a helicopter crew flew to a remote 
encampment saturday to rescue a competitor in the iditarod trail 
sled dog race who was reported to be suffering from hypothermia and 
shock 
mike madden 27 of north pole was rescued by a military 
helicopter at about 930 am eight hours after fellow musher jerry 
austin told race officials that madden needed help members of the 
race board said 
madden was 30 miles east of the checkpoint at iditarod which 
marks the halfway point of the 1168 mile race race officials said 
maddens condition stabilized after he was flown to mcgrath en route 
to an anchorage hospital 
the national weather service in anchorage said the low 
temperature in iditarod early saturday was probably about 5 degrees 
an hh3 jolly green giant helicopter from elmendorf air force 
base flew a doctor accompanied by austin to help madden who also 
was reported to have injured his knee while chopping dogfood earlier 
in the race 
austin intended to take care of maddens dogs after the 
evacuation said leo rasmussen president of the iditarod board the 
detour was a setback for austin who has already been hampered by 
sick dogs 
it destroys his chances for a top 20 finish and will probably 
make him one of the last teams to come into nome race board 
member tom busch said busch added that three rookie mushers who 
stayed with madden while austin was fetching help probably ruined 
their chances for the rookie of the year award 
madden a carpenter moved to alaska from billings mont in 
1983 and began mushing the following year he was running in the 
iditarod for the first time 
veteran musher martin buser led the anchoragetonome race on its 
eighth day buser 30 left grayling at 334 am about four hours 
ahead of susan butcher and rick swenson grayline is 497 miles from 
the finish line in nome 
butcher has won the last three races and swenson is a fourtime 
champion buser who runs a kennel in big lake has never won the 
iditarod but finished third in last years race 
with madden apparently out of the race the field of contenders 
fell to 41 the lowest figure since 1985 fortynine mushers were in 
the lineup when the race began march 4 
mushers are vying for a 250000 purse including 50000 for the 
winner

the allegations 
alcides sakala a spokesman in lisbon for the us and south 
africanbacked rebel group unita contended the sovietsupported 
angolan government is waging a campaign to discredit the rebels

chingunji unitas former washington representative was being held 
against his will in the rebels southern stronghold of jamba in the 
former portuguese colony

the national union for the total independence of angola 
in london independent television news the world this week 
broadcast on saturday an interview with a young man indentified as 
chingunjis nephew dinho chingunji a unitafunded student in 
london who had asked for asylum in britain 
i believe savimbi killed six members of my family including my 
father and grandparents has also been responsible for the killing 
of several unita prominent members and also been responsible for the 
burning and killing of young children chingunji said 
he spelled out the separate cases which he said occurred over a 
period of 20 years he said he had been told by relatives recently 
that savimbi was behind the killings 
sousa jamba described as a young unita writer in london and the 
brother of savimbis education secretary said savimbi was 
eliminating any rivals to his leadership

members of san diegos small iranian community 
say they fear that a suspected terrorist bombing here may add to the 
burden of blame they already carry for their roots in the troubled 
middle east 
a fiery explosion friday destroyed a van driven by the wife of 
capt will rogers iii who directed the july 1988 missile attack 
that mistakenly downed an iranian airplane in the persian gulf 
the van bombing which left sharon rogers uninjured has stirred 
speculation that the attack was to avenge the deaths of the 290 
people aboard the civilian jetliner 
people blame us for everything the ayatollah khomeini of iran 
does from bookburnings to hijackings said sara ahamadianfard 
who came to the united states in 1975 with her husband a student at 
united states international university here 
so it wont surprise me if people assume iranians had something 
to do with this she said 
mrs rogers received a threatening call after the jetliners 
destruction navy cmdr david dillon said no one has claimed 
responsibility for the attack which is under investigation by 
federal authorities 
adeeb nozar ahmadi who works at a san diego grocery store said 
he worries that someone angered by the van bombing might take out 
their frustration on him or his young son 
i can tell when some people come into the store that they dont 
think i deserve to be here that i am somehow a terrorist because of 
the actions of people i dont even know he said i wonder a lot 
what they would do if they got mad enough if i could become their 
victim 
several immigrants in the local iranian community estimated at 
5000 in the early 1980s said they dont necessarily condone 
khomeinis actions such as the death sentence issued to author 
salman rushdie for his novel the satanic verses 
its like blaming all germans for the holocaust said akbar 
khasravi an english tutor of iranian immigrants 
khasravi said he abhors any act of violence directed against 
innocent people including iranians 
please remember that the people on the jetliner shot down by 
the american navy were innocent too just as the woman in the van 
was innocent

a company that markets weapons systems to 
the us government and more than 60 other countries has agreed to 
plead guilty to bribing foreign officials and will pay 1 million in 
penalties 
no charges have been filed in the case but officials of the 
venturian corp said friday that the companys lawyers had made a 
plea agreement with federal prosecutors after a 1year grand jury 
investigation 
the grand jury continues to investigate and could indict 
officials at the company which markets a wide range of weapons 
systems including armed patrol boats and accessories for the m16 
family of military rifles 
in a public statement released friday venturian said its plea 
agreement could bar the company from receiving defense contracts and 
strip it of export privileges 
venturians president gary rappaport said in a news release that 
if the government does limit the companys operations he doesnt 
believe the restrictions would be in place for a long time 
a ban on defense contracts and exporting could wipe out as much 
as 95 percent of venturians annual sales the company statement 
said 
rappaport said the company agreed to plead guilty to put the 
matter behind us the acts which were the subject of the 
investigation were isolated instances and the person allegedly 
involved is no longer with the company 
in addition to the bribery charges the company has agreed to 
plead guilty to assisting the preparation and filing of false tax 
returns and conspiring to violate various federal antifraud laws and 
the foreign corrupt practices act 
the government will require venturian to pay restitution 
penalties and fines totaling 1 million the guilty pleas are 
expected to be lodged late next month 
venturian through its subsidiary napco international inc 
sells spare military parts and other equipment to the governments 
it had sales of about 33 million and profits of about 900000 in 
1987 
through the first nine months of 1988 venturian reported losses 
of 125000 on revenues of 231 million rappaport told venturians 
115 employees that the company has an investment portfolio worth 
about 5 million and no debt 
the foreign corrupt practices act makes it a crime for us 
companies to bribe foreign officials and holds the corporations 
accountable even when foreign employees violate company policy by 
making the bribes

leftwing guerrillas fired a grenade early 
saturday at an armored police vehicle guarding the headquarters of 
the governing aprista party and a bystander was wounded police 
reported 
friday night in a nationally televised address prime minister 
armando villanueva appealed for greater public support of the fight 
against perus guerrilla groups 
he said at least 14000 people have been killed in 
guerrillarelated violence since the maoist shining path movement

tupac amaru revolutionary movement which is smaller and less active 
than the shining path and took up arms in 1984 
police said the grenade fired from a station wagon fell short of 
the armored car injured a bystander and shattered windows in 
buildings 
villanueva called on peruvians to join in a campaign against

president augusto pinochet said saturday 
he is willing to consider some constitutional changes sought by the 
opposition critics suggested he was maneuvering to be allowed to 
run in the december elections 
small groups of antigovernment demonstrators battled with 
pinochet supporters in the downtown streets after the presidents 
speech at a government office building police used water cannons to 
stop the fighting and there were no immediate reports of arrests or 
serious injuries 
pinochet is the army commander who led the coup that ousted the 
government of marxist president salvador allende in sepember 1973 
and he has headed the military government since then 
a constitution drafted by his government was enacted in 1981 
barring a president from succeeding himself several opponents said 
pinochet might consider some constitutional reforms in exchange for 
an amendment that would permit him to be a presidential candidate in 
this years balloting 
pinochet said in his speech that the only intention the 
government has in indicating its willingness to modify the 
constitution is to perfect it 
our aim is far from the intentions of those who want to 
dismantle our institutional structure or those who think that the 
president who leads the country is acting with some hidden personal 
aim he added 
after the speech he told a cheering crowd outside the building 
that they should unite behind a candidate who would continue his 
policies 
pinochet lost a referendum in october on a proposal to extend his 
rule to 1997 the loss by a vote of 39 million to 31 million 
obliged him to call open elections scheduled for dec 14 he is to 
hand over power to the new government on march 11 1990 
pinochet said in the speech that he had instructed interior 
minister carlos caceres to study several constitutional changes 
proposed by opposition groups 
he said he found worthy of study suggestions that would 
modify an article banning marxism shorten the planned eightyear 
presidential term and eliminate the presidents emergency power to 
send citizens into exile 
opponents said the changes are needed to ensure democracy when an 
elected government takes office the amendments would have to be 
approved in a national referendum 
pinochet said he also would consider changes to shorten the 
presidential term and erase the presidents power to dissolve the 
house of deputies and exile opponents 
some opposition groups oppose the constitutions provision for a 
presidential term of eight years before the 1973 coup the president 
served for six years

a judge responding to an artists appeal has 
ordered workers to stop dismantling a governmentcommissioned 
sculpture once described as a potential terrorist device by a 
security specialist 
the artist richard serra filed legal action friday when workers 
with jackhammers began digging up the cobblestones around the 
sculpture tilted arc in a lower manhattan plaza on government 
orders 
this government is savage it is eating its culture serra 
said saturday a day after he asked judge robert p patterson of the 
us district court in manhattan for a lastditch action 
at 8 pm friday patterson issued a temporary restraining order 
valid until thursday 
serras lawyer jay topkis argued serras work falls under the 
berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic works 
which the united states joined march 1 
the 112footlong 12foothigh rusting metal curve for which 
serra said the carter administration paid 175000 was installed 
in front of a government office building at 26 federal plaza in 1981 
the metal arc soon became the object of complaints 
the removal of the sculpture will result in the community 
receiving more open space said william j diamond the regional 
administrator of the general services administration in charge of 
the plaza 
removing the sculpture to a motorvehicle compound in brooklyn 
would allow for more benches and chairs and a more livable 
environment he said in saturdays new york times 
serra warned if his sculpture is removed every artistic and 
literary work commissioned by the government was in jeopardy of 
censorship 
its a death blow its thoughtless and barbaric said serra 
the us government has never before destroyed a work of art it 
has commissioned 
he blamed diamond for the decision saying the administrator was 
responsible for a march 1985 public hearing in new york that 
recommended the removal of tilted arc 
diamond convened a hearing at which he was both the prosecutor 
and the judge serra said diamond found the piece distasteful 
but thats no reason to destroy it 
gsa officials reached by telephone said diamond would not be 
available on saturday to respond to serras charges 
at the hearing serra said a government security agent said 
that tilted arc was a terrorist device comparing it to those used 
by bomb experts 
according to a transcript of the hearing which serra quoted 
vickie odougherty a security specialist for the gsa testified 
that the front curvature of the sculptures design is comparable 
to devices which are used by bomb experts to vent explosive forces 
for instance they have bomb trucks designed for this purpose which 
are cylindrical in shape and angled comparable to that of 
tilted arc 
this device vents an explosion both upward and in an angle 
toward both buildings including a nearby fbi building and pistol 
range serra quoted her as saying 
at the request of the gsa a national endowment for the arts 
panel convened in december 1987 in new york and recommended the work 
not be removed serra said but the gsa decided to ignore the 
record of hearing 
after the hearings serra filed suit arguing that moving the 
work would ruin it because it was sitespecific a cylinder that 
is impaled into the ground he also charged the government was 
violating his first amendment rights 
a federal judge in august 1987 dismissed the suit saying the 
sculpture was an expression of free speech as protected by the first 
amendment but that the government had the right to do what it 
wished with its property 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals upheld the judges action 
in may 
serra called controversy around his sculpture a test case of 
moral rights for all artists so that the government cant at whim 
destroy art works 
the moral rights clause of the berne convention gives an 
artist the right even after sale of a work to object to any 
distortion mutilation or other modification that shall be 
prejudicial to his honor and reputation

communist rebels on saturday claimed 
responsibility for the killing of a prominent supporter of us 
military bases and the military said nearly 160 moslem insurgents 
surrendered 
the communist new peoples army said in a statement that its 
guerrillas shot businessman remigio nepomuceno 43 in angeles city 
last wednesday because he committed crimes against the people 
including murder and rape 
nepomucenos family owns an electric company and a school and is 
involved in real estate and financing in angeles city home of the 
us clark air base 50 miles north of manila 
police believed nepomuceno was slain because he helped organize 
several rallies in support of the bases the rallies coincided with 
leftist demonstrations urging the government to close the us 
facilities 
the rebels said nepomucenos support for the bases was not the 
motive for the killing 
we in the npa respect the political beliefs of other people 
even though these are opposed to our position the statement said 
they accused nepomuceno of killing a student activist forcing 
women into prostitution raping three women and serving as a channel 
for funds to anticommunist vigilante groups 
there was no comment from the victims family or police on the 
allegations nepomuceno comes from one of the most prominent 
political families in the angeles area and no criminal charges were 
pending against him 
also saturday the military said 159 moro national liberation 
front guerrillas and supporters surrendered saturday on the southern 
island of tawitawi 650 miles south of manila 
air force chief maj gen jose de leon who accepted the 
surrender promised government assistance to the rebels to 
reintegrate themselves into national life the rebels turned over 
about 50 weapons 
two weeks ago defense secretary fidel ramos accepted the 
surrender of nearly 900 front guerrillas and supporters on jolo 
island which is near tawitawi 
both islands are strongholds of the moro national liberation 
front largest of three islamic groups which have been waging a 
nearly 20year insurgency for selfrule in moslem areas of the 
southern philippines 
president corazon aquino promised autonomy to moslem areas when 
she took power three years ago after the overthrow of ferdinand 
marcos but few steps have been taken and a bill to establish an 
autonomous region in the south has been stalled in congress 
in the past both communist and moslem rebel groups have accused 
the military of faking surrender ceremonies for propaganda purposes 
rounding up civilians to take oaths of allegiance before television 
cameras

thousands of miles from the middle east conflict 
a group of palestinians and israelis sat down together saturday to 
begin discussions on common goals for peace 
officials from the plo liberal members of israels parliament 
and a leading representative from the occupied territories joined 
with arab and jewishamerican leaders for the symposium at columbia 
university 
the symposium sponsored by the israeli journal new outlook and 
the palestinian weekly al fajr along with us groups was based on 
principles including the mutual right to selfdetermination 
renunciation of violence and support for an international peace 
conference to include both the israeli government and the palestine 
liberation organization 
there was also to be discussion on resolving conflicts such as 
the 15month uprising in the west bank and gaza strip that has 
claimed the lives of almost 400 palestinians and 17 israelis 
while there would be much discussion there would be no 
unexpected announcements or concessions said nabil shaath chairman 
of the political committee of the palestine national council the 
legislative arm of the plo 
there is a lot to do before we are asked again for new 
concessions shaath said saturday before the meetings began 
the major concession the plos recognition of the state of 
israels right to exist has already been made he said 
yossi sarid a knesset member in the leftwing citizens rights 
movement said that regardless of the outcome the success is the 
very existence of this meeting 
sarid noted polls that show about 55 percent of israelis support 
holding talks with the plo yet 90 percent believe the plo is a 
threat to israel the plo must search its own soul why dont 
people believe it he said

and yair tsaban they have parliamentary immunity from an israeli 
law barring israeli citizens from meeting with plo officials

secretary of state james a baker iii may have 
violated a justice department conflict of interest ruling while he 
was treasury secretary in 1987 the boston sunday globe reported 
the globe in sundays editions said baker rejected a proposal 
to force us commercial banks to forgive a large portion of 
brazils debt while he owned stock in one of the banks 
the newspapers report came nearly a month after baker appeared 
to have put the controversy over his holdings in chemical new york 
corp behind him after the issue arose early last month baker 
quickly moved to silence critics by selling those assets as well as 
all other publicly traded stocks that he held in a blind trust 
members of congress noted at the time that baker had acted on 
third world loan issues while treasury secretary under president 
reagan baker was credited with developing the baker plan which 
called on third world nations to make good on their debts 
according to the globe it was at a september 1987 meeting with 
brazils finance minister that baker who at the time owned an 
estimated 2 million in chemical bank stock rejected that countrys 
proposal to restructure some of its 70 billion debt to us banks 
chemical bank has lent 45 million to third world nations 
brazil among them 
three months before baker took the action his general counsel 
received a justice department ruling that highranking federal 
officials should not take part in any decisions effecting their 
personal finances the globe said 
a subsequent study by a economics professor at stanford 
university said bakers decision had a positive effect on the market 
value of the banks stock the stocks value rose 40 percent in the 
first six months after the decision from 20 to 28 a share 
d edward wilson jr the treasury departments former deputy 
general counsel said that in retrospect he probably should have 
warned baker about the possible conflict 
if there was a screwup it was mine wilson now a private 
attorney said saturday he probably should have been warned there 
was a potential problem there 
robert m kimmitt then the treasury departments general 
counsel said last week that bakers participation in the brazil 
decision had been cleared by the departments ethics officer 
miklos lonkay the ethics officer who cleared bakers 
participation in the brazil decision confirmed that he advised 
kimmitt now bakers general counsel at the state department that 
baker was not required to remove himself from third world debt 
issues generally 
like wilson however lonkay said he did not know the specifics 
of the brazil proposal 
the justice department ruling said the federal 
conflictofinterest law should be interpreted as prohibiting 
officials from participating in any rulemaking and general policy 
matters if their decision would have a direct and predictable 
effect on their personal holdings 
c boyden gray the white house counsel stressed the justice 
department ruling as his principal argument in persuading a 
reluctant baker to divest himself of his chemical stock last month 
the globe said 
baker said he was selling the stock to avoid the perception of a 
conflict of interest 
wilson said he and other lawyers in the treasury office had 
examined the ruling and concluded that it was unlikely baker could 
set a policy or make a single decision that would have a direct 
effect on his holdings in chemical 
i checked every meeting baker had to make sure that there was 
no chance a potential conflictofinterest problem might 
arise wilson said on this one i must have overlooked how 
much brazil owed chemical he told the newspaper

a mount mckinley climbing party of three 
japanese men is presumed dead 3000 feet below the summit of north 
americas tallest peak the national park service said saturday 
im afraid i see no hope for the survival of the three men 
knowing what we know right now ranger bob seibert said in calling 
off a search by speciallyequipped army helicopters and an 
international group of climbers 
searchers in a twinengine airplane friday flew over part of the 
20320foot peak and observed three objects possibly bodies at the 
17400foot level 200 feet above the japanese partys camp a 
followup flight by two ch47c army helicopters was organized 
saturday in an unsuccessful attempt to make identification 
climb leader noboru yamada 39 teruo saegusa 31 and kozo 
komatsu 34 all of tokyo set off on their expedition feb 16 and 
last were seen by an austrian team descending the mountain as the 
japanese were climbing 
weve had two days of good mountaineering weather and weve 
seen nobody seibert said he said earlier that if the men were 
alive and well they would be moving about 
seibert said he no longer could justify the risks the search 
posed for the rescue team aboard aircraft hindered by turbulence and 
severe downdrafts 
sometimes we had no aircraft control said chief warrant 
officer myron babcock a pilot with 16 years of experience flying 
chinook helicopters 
in trying to reach the bowl where the reddishorange objects were 
observed the helicopters saturday encountered downdrafts that 
forced them downward at than 2000 feet per minute even with the 
aircraft operating at maximum power 
what were presumed to be the bodies were sighted just below 
denali pass an area notorious for its ferocious wind 
its my guess they were blown right out of the pass ranger 
roger robinson said if that happened the japanese would have 
fallen 800 vertical feet robinson said 
searchers had waited most of the week for safe flying weather on 
friday a week after the return date the climbers stated when they 
set out winds abated enough for the airplane but not for the 
helicopters 
before fridays flight seibert had said he was optimistic the 
japanese were alive he described the men as wellequipped 
experienced climbers and said it was possible they were waiting out 
the weather in snow caves 
park service officials said the climbers also were aware of the 
agencys food cache at the mountains 17200foot level 
i wish we could have done more and found more but sometimes it 
doesnt work out seibert said when he announced the search was 
over

fbi director william sessions said 
saturday that the bombing of a van owned by the wife of the uss 
vincennes commander does not signal the beginning of a new frontier 
for international terrorism 
i dont think were seeing a trend at all he said referring 
to the explosion that destroyed the van of the wife of navy capt 
will rogers iii who mistakenly ordered the destruction of an 
iranian passenger jet 
we are deeply concerned about that kind of activity whether 
it is in fact a terrorist act sessions said at a news conference 
you just cant tell at this stage 
sessions didnt offer new information on the fbis investigation 
into the explosion friday that sharon rogers escaped unhurt but 
investigators have speculated the bombing was to avenge the 290 
people killed in the vincennes destruction of an iranian jetliner 
last july 
sessions said there is no direct evidence that it was a terrorist 
bombing and he said it may be some time before fbi investigators 
are able to determine that 
it is always troubling and of course the fbi pays very 
careful attention on all those investigations because they are all 
very important because terrorism is a very disturbing and very 
divisive and difficult matter to deal with he added 
counterterrorism has been a priority with the fbi for the past 
six years and will continue to be so said sessions who would not 
acknowledge that the nation has become more vulnerable to terrorist 
acts 
both the domestic terrorism investigations and the 
international terrorism investigations have had a great deal of 
effect on our ability to curtail terroristic acts in the united 
states 
at the same time international terrorism last year suffered 
some 875 different incidents of which about 25 percent involved 
american citizens

the bush administration seeking to lay the 
foundation for peace talks plans to ask the palestine liberation 
organization and israel to to reduce tension in the israelioccupied 
west bank and gaza strip a newspaper reported 
in its sunday editions the new york times quoted a senior bush 
administration official who said specific suggestions for israel 
will be presented monday when israels foreign minister moshe 
arens meets with president bush and members of his staff 
the administration official told the newspaper that suggestions 
for the plo will be presented to the plo through the american 
ambassador in tunis robert pelletreau jr 
the suggestions the bush administration is expected to put 
forward to the israeli government include ending or limiting 
administrative detention of palestinians reopening schools in the 
occupied territories and releasing some palestinians involved in the 
15month uprising against the israelis 
the plo is expected to be asked to end all violent demonstrations 
in the territories block antiisraeli raids from southern lebanon 
and stop distributing inflammatory leaflets 
the newspaper said bush hopes the suggestions will be the first 
steps toward peace talks between israel and the plo however the 
administration official said the bush proposal does not include a 
fullfledged peace plan 
one senior state department official said the bush plan comes 
from the conviction that peace in the middle east cannot be made 
in america in the last analysis the parties out there have to make 
the tough decisions and all we can do is help them lay the proper 
foundations and build the proper frame as they go along 
the senior administration official said the president will move 
slowly and only move when we think there is a reasonable chance of 
success 
the newspaper also said israel will be asked to ease some of the 
economic restrictions it has imposed on palestinians from the west 
bank and gaza who have not paid their taxes since the uprisings 
began in december 1987 
palestinians who have not paid taxes cannot obtain identity 
cards drivers licenses or travel permits 
the administration official said it could be difficult for the 
plo to convince palestinians that concessions on their part would 
improve the chances for peace in the area

the bush administration fearful that hundreds of 
stinger missiles it sold to afghan rebels may fall into the hands of 
private arms dealers or terrorists is devising a plan to buy back 
the weapons the new york times reported 
the times in its sunday editions said however that senior 
administration believe it may be an impossible task to persuade the 
rebels to return even some of the stingers 
at an interagency meeting wednesday at the white house headed by 
robert graves the deputy national security adviser the cia was 
given the task of developing a strategy for the stinger recovery 
the newspaper reported 
the united states may try to barter stateoftheart irrigation 
equipment trucks tractors and medical facilities as well as sheep 
and mules in exchange for the shoulderheld rockets according to 
the times 
the bush administration also is considering trying to shift 
covert military aid approved by congress into funds for 
reconstruction and the return of up to five million refugees 
some of these funds would then be set aside for stinger recovery 
the newspaper said 
its prudent for the administration to try to recover the 
stingers but i personally doubt it will succeed said rep 
charles wilson dtexas who was instrumental in persuading the 
reagan administration to give the rebels stingers 
frank c carlucci the former secretary of defense told the 
times well never get them back never 
american intelligence officials estimate the rebels have 200 to 
500 stingers but have no clear idea what rebel groups have the 
weapons or where they are stored the times said 
sen dennis deconcini the arizona democrat said we were 
assured that the stingers were turned over to teams of afghan 
mujahedeen who were identifiable so we could monitor them and get 
them back but im fearful that may not be the case 
the stinger is the armys most advanced infantry antiaircraft 
missile it is often referred to as the perfect terrorist weapon 
since mid1986 when the first stingers were delivered to the 
rebels some of them have fallen into the hands of soviet commandoes 
and iranian revolutionary guards 
bush administration officials told the newspaper the united 
states will urge pakistan which has been responsible for funneling 
american military aid to the rebel groups to help in the stinger 
recovery efforts

here are excerpts from the address given 
friday to us bishops by cardinal eduard gagnon the president of 
the pontifical council for the family 
introductory remarks on marriage and the family 
the authentic teaching of the church has usually to go against 
what is commonly promoted in the secularist schools and mass media 
and is often misunderstood or misrepresented inside the church 
itself 
it is indeed cumbersome and irritating at times to hear families 
complain about what is being taught to their children but 
listening to them might be the only way we have to know what is 
happening at the grass roots of our catholic communities and 
institutions 
what happens in your country always has an influence especially 
in the developing countries but also in europe 
abortion 
our council has witnessed with great interest the progress which 
the courageous work of laity and clergy since the roe vs wade 
decision has realized in forming consciences and changing 
mentalities 
the american church has not yet obtained everything it would 
desire but it has demonstrated that even adverse public events can 
become a providential occasion for that essential part of 
evangelization which is to defend the most fundamental right of the 
human person 
you have made many to understand what is expressed in the charter 
of the rights of the family economic aid for the advancement of 
peoples must not be conditioned on acceptance of programs of 
contraception sterilization or abortion 
the bishops in charge of the family apostate for bishops 
conferences in more than 50 countries have begged their brother 
bishops of politically powerful nations to protect them from the new 
form of colonialism which antilife programs constitute they are 
sure you can do something to defend them 
pornography 
i know you are trying to work with all people of good will in 
defending youth and adults alike against the danger to their 
personhood coming from pornography and the potent industries behind 
it 
i would suggest that we do something too about another and more 
subtle pornography that is the degrading of moral values vehicled 
by cinema and tv shows which pretend to depict normal american life 
at a un meeting a sociologist defined the developed and 
underdeveloped nations as those who looked at or could not look at 
the dallas tv series 
we feel our fellow citizens are adult enough to resist such 
poisonous food but the pastors of other worlds would like us to 
reflect on what we export can do to the conscience of their people 
natural family planning 
a problem has emerged about which we have to be vigilant that of 
combining natural family planning with methods of artificial 
contraception at times because international planned parenthood 
foundation or similar groups try to infiltrate catholic 
associations and corrupt and pirate nfp methods 
marriage indissolubility and tribunals 
the prevalent divorce mentality has rendered the role of marriage 
tribunals most essential and at the same time most complex 
we know you are worried about the problems you are confronted 
with because of the lack of personnel for the tribunals and the huge 
number of broken marriages 
women religious can be very helpful in dealing with marriage 
cases but we have to be careful that their tender hearts do not 
play tricks on them 
marriage preparation and doctrine 
i think we should not be pessimistic about the possibility of 
reversing trends and changing the climate of hostility which has 
been prevalent against the magisteriums doctrine on conjugal 
morality 
the number of good young couples who look for sound spiritual 
guidance is much greater than we would think 
a new challenge is offered to the church by the efforts of 
planned parenthood to set up schoolbased clinics for abortion 
referral and contraception a way to oppose this menace in all 
dioceses would be to develop a united policy and practice on a 
national level planned parenthood programs of sex education in no 
way resolve the problem of teenage pregnancies but rather increase 
it by encouraging promiscuity the statistical fact surprisingly 
turned up in one of their own surveys 
other issues 
another question is the spreading of euthanasia word 
engineering that leads to idea engineering could ultimately lead 
to legalization of euthanasia as it has done for abortion 
a further question is that of the ministry to remarried 
divorcees some forms of such ministry ignoring the principles set 
in familias consortio have degenerated into dating services for 
divorced catholics who are not free to marry i know that their 
promoters are personages who cannot easily be brought under 
episcopal control maybe some guidelines coming from your conference 
could help priests and faithful in their discernment 
it is evident that ideological feminism has a deleterious 
influence on the family but conversely the best way to counter its 
influence will be to care more about the family and make every one 
in it more conscious of his or her vocation to serve and not be 
served as christ has taught us 
much is being said here of feminism i would just like to remark 
that when we work as we should for the promotion of women we 
should be careful in choosing the persons we work with

the un human rights commission ended its 1989 
session on friday with votes on cuba and romania rounding out a 
list of more than 100 resolutions and decisions in a sixweek 
meeting 
under a measure backed by romanias warsaw pact ally hungary and 
by all western and some third world countries romania will come 
under a un inquiry for alleged grave human rights abuses 
in coming under scrutiny it joins such nations as chile el 
salvador south africa 
relations between communist neighbors romania and hungary 
deteriorated after hungary publicly accused romania of depriving its 
ethnic hungarian minority of their ethnic and cultural rights 
romania denies it 
a vaguely worded resolution on cuba supported by both the havana 
government and the united states dashed washingtons hopes of a 
continued un surveillance of the human rights situation under the 
fidel castro government 
a western proposal that would have added iraq to the list of 
suspected human rights violators failed to come to a vote iraq 
blocked it by a procedural motion backed by most third world 
countries which had a majority in the 43nation panel 
the commission approved a draft convention on the rights of 
children and a draft protocol designed to promote the abolition of 
the death penalty both drafts go before next falls un general

forget plastics the glow is off computers 
hazardous waste disposal is the hightech growth industry of the 
1990s 
so say some of the 500 environmental entrepreneurs executives 
and consultants who recently stormed a twoday conference on how to 
profit from americas toxic waste problem 
two or three years ago if youd said youre having a hazardous 
waste business conference youd get very few people showing up 
said stephen l irish whose company extracts heavy metals from 
contaminated wastewater 
but it was standing room only at a recent session in the copley 
plaza hotels ornate ballroom 
the subject identifying market opportunities in the hazardous 
waste industry or as one attendee put it given that companies 
dont publicize their hazardous waste problems how do we identify 
potential customers 
other sessions covered how to comply with environmental 
regulations how to minimize legal liability surviving 
hypergrowth and preventing your employees from becoming your 
archrivals that is how to protect toxic trade secrets 
the beverage served everywhere was mineral water 
hazardous waste processing will be a 5 billion industry this 
year and could hit 12 billion by 1994 said conference organizer 
richard s golob publisher of the weekly newsletter harzardous 
materials intelligence report 
there is no shortage of stuff to clean up the environmental 
protection agency has identified 30000 potentially hazardous sites 
of which 1000 now qualify for superfund cleanup money according 
to golob other surveys have estimated that up to 430000 us 
manufacturing plants may have some kind of contamination 
and the department of energy has estimated the cost of managing 
disposing and cleaning up radioactive and hazardous contamination at 
its own facilities could range from 53 billion to 92 billion 
department spokesman will callicott said 
heavy industry is by no means the only culprit the manufacturing 
of pharmaceuticals consumer products and even decaffeinated coffee 
produces hazardous waste 
as state and federal environmental regulations get stiffer 
companies that can deal with infectious waste radioactive 
contamination and dirty drinking water are in special demand 
stephen irishs enterprise was born last year from tougher state 
and federal groundwater regulations electroplating plants produce 
rinsewater that includes heavy metals including nickel lead and a 
cancercausing chromium compound said irish director of marketing 
for unc reclamation a mulberry fla subsidiary of unc inc 
unc reclamation installs equipment that extracts the metals from 
rinsewater irish said the residue is turned into metal salts that 
can be sold back to the electroplaters he said 
the service costs electroplaters less than dumping their metallic 
sludge in landfills did and it eliminates their longterm legal 
liability irish said the process also ensures that no contaminants 
will leak from a landfill into groundwater 
clearly its the intent of congress to keep anything from going 
into the ground irish said reclamation is what they want 
unc reclamation generated a slight profit last year and sales are 
expected to hit 12 million this year he said the firm plans to 
expand into cleaning up toxic sludge from batteries that have been 
dumped into some gainesville fla lagoons 
the environmental boom has already produced some hazardous waste 
millionaires golob said one hightech entrepreneur is alan s 
mckim who founded clean harbors inc of boston in 1980 at the age 
of 25 the company said it now has nearly 1000 employees and had 
sales of 73 million last year 
but the industry has to cope with more than its share of 
regulation and red tape said thomas moran vice president of 
dartamerica of freehold nj 
dartamerica transports toxic lowlevel nuclear and solid waste 
to approved disposal sites it is regulated by the epa and the 
federal department of transportation and has to have a panoply of 
permits that allow it to truck waste in 48 states it takes three 
fulltime employees just to handle shipping permits moran said 
in new york pcbs are regulated and waste oil isnt in new 
jersey oil is regulated but pcbs arent moran said youre 
like a slave to 48 masters

as he fled wounded through the jungles of 
cambodia sichan siv never could have imagined that in 13 years he 
would be a top aide to an american president 
for siv 41 deputy assistant to president bush for public 
liaison the term american dream is not a cliche his almost 
unbelievable story is the stuff of movies 
in a symbolic gesture siv opted to start his job feb 13 the 
13th anniversary of his escape from cambodia but he said with a 
smile the highlight of his 4weekold tenure at the white house 
came when he met bush last week and the president pronounced my 
name right 
in his new job one of two deputies in the office siv is bushs 
contact with ethnic and minority groups he deals with issues like 
civil rights education the homeless and refugees 
sivs tortuous path from wounded refugee to presidential aide 
began after the khmer rouge a brutal communist insurgency defeated 
the usbacked government of lon nol in april 1975 
before his escape siv rode a bicycle across cambodia for 20 
days survived in a khmer rouge labor camp eating a bowl of rice a 
day and worked myriad jobs from dawn to dusk 
i dug irrigation canals i plowed land i planted rice i 
harvested rice he said 
he fled cambodia 10 months after the khmer rouge takeover by 
jumping off a timber truck and running through the jungle without 
food for three days until he reached thailand en route he stepped 
on a land mine 
about 15 family members including his mother were among the 
hundreds of thousands of people killed by the pol pot regime 
it was his mother a buddhist whose philosophy helped him 
survive siv said 
the two things she told me are as long as you live you must 
always have hope and happiness is something you cant keep 
unless you give it away those are the basic values of life that i 
have always kept with me he said in an interview 
sivs new life working in an ornate highceilinged office at 
the white house complex seems light years away from the cambodian 
bush 
but siv who dresses in pinstriped suits with suspenders and 
speaks english with an accent keeps mementos nearby native musical 
instruments silver ornaments and books about his native land 
the son of a policeman siv received his high school and college 
education in phnom penh cambodias capital before the capital 
fell he worked with the airline as a high school teacher and as an 
administrator with care the relief organization 
he was supposed to be evacuated from the us embassy by 
helicopter but missed the last flight out on april 12 1975 by 30 
minutes it took him until the following february to make his break 
during that time siv was forced to conceal his education from 
the khmer rouge who were determined to stamp out the intelligensia 
and his decision to get to the thaicambodian border meant a 
traumatic separation from his family 
arriving in thailand siv was jailed as an illegal entrant but 
was later released and placed in a refugee camp there a catholic 
relief group found a couple in wallingford conn willing to 
sponsor siv he arrived in the united states with 2 in his pocket 
hes a person with a great deal of charisma said bob 
charles the wallingford man who brought siv to this country 
charles is a housing consultant 
with nothing to his name siv picked apples and worked in an ice 
cream parlor before new york city beckoned there he drove a taxi 
cab for six months and later got a job with the lutheran 
immigration and refugee service 
eager to improve his lot siv won a scholarship from columbia 
university where he obtained a masters degree in international 
affairs degree in hand siv worked at the united nations and for 
the institute for international education 
siv also a texas connection through his wife martha a united 
nations librarian from pampa texas im the honorary mayor of 
pampa siv said proudly displaying a key to the city married in 
1983 the couple has no children 
in 1987 siv went to work for bush as he says one of the many 
faceless volunteers in new york he raised money and made contacts 
with the asian community 
once bush was elected chase untermeyer a texan who heads the 
white house personnel office recommended siv for his present job 
john sununu the white house chief of staff and david demarest the 
communications director approved the hiring 
i was impressed not only with the substance and drama of his 
backround but also his political acumen his character and his 
obvious knowledge of how to get things done and a drive and 
sticktoitiveness that you need in the job hes got demarest 
said 
court robinson an analyst with the us committee for refugees 
who knows siv said the new white house aide has focused heavily on 
cambodian issues but refugees like siv often have a keen interest 
in the domestic issues of their adopted country he said hes 
always struck me as bright and articulate robinson said 
siv attributes his rise to his adaptability i have been 
fortunate to get myself adjusted into new situations very quickly 
he said 
hard work is another must for the upwardly mobile siv said he 
has promised himself he wont work more than 13 hours on weekdays 
and 10 hours on the weekend 
it doesnt matter how many hours i put in there is no 
single minute that is boring or dull he said

if fritz lang had known that his 1926 film 
metropolis would become a musical he might have laughed 
perhaps victor hugo would have also after all if hugos epic 
19thcentury novel les miserables could become a hit musical 
why not langs classic vision of the future 
i think les miz is the best thing ever thats what id like 
our show to live up to said joseph brooks who wrote the grammy 
awardwinning song you light up my life from the 1977 movie of 
that name 
metropolis which opened in london march 8 cost 25 million 
pounds 438 million and is the first of several largescale 
musicals to open this year in london 
its bow at the piccadilly theater follows a bad period for 
british musical productions in 1988 when chess and carrie 
flopped on broadway and cancan budgie and ziegfeld 
died in london 
brooks has cowritten the music book and lyrics of 
metropolis frenchman jerome savary who staged a hit paris 
revival of cabaret in 1986 is directing with choreography by 
tom jobe the american who starred in chess in london 
brian blessed the original old deuteronomy in cats heads 
the cast as john freeman the evil master of the machineage 
metropolis where the action takes place the romantic leads are 
played by graham bickley and judy kuhn who was nominated for a tony 
for her role in the american production of chess in a show 
that despite its emphasis on technology aims to put emotion first 
im hopeful that the music and the emotional content of what we 
want to say are what will be taken home said brooks 
brooks moved to london in 1985 with his wife and two children 
intending to write a musical and he was searching for strongly 
visual material that would transfer well to the stage 
his wife susan asked the british film institute for a list of 
its movies brooks recalled when the title metropolis appeared 
her reaction was thats the film a series of screenings 
ensued followed by negotiations with the fritz lang estate in 
vienna 
metropolis is a stupefying tale about workers in a 
modernistic city who live underground a sweet girl named maria 
soothes their unrest until a mad scientist creates an artificial 
evil maria who leads the workers to revolt the silent film a 
benchmark of german expressionism was reissued in 1984 with a 
colored tint and a score by giorgio moroder 
the play is brooks first writing for the theater he composed 
the music for the films marjoe the garden of the 
finzicontinis and the lords of flatbush and has written over 
140 advertising jingles mostly for television 
i grew up in manhattan loving all the old standards 
carousel oklahoma they all had tremendous melodies thats 
what ive tried to do 
but the initial appeal of metropolis may well lie in its 
scenery which takes up onethird of the musicals budget its 
massive grayandblack pipefilled sets evoke an oppressively cold 
mechanistic environment populated by two worlds the underground 
one of the two lovers and the elitist one ruled by the evil inventor 
freeman 
brooks and his colleagues dispute suggestions that metropolis 
is another british technospectacle such as cats and starlight 
express 
if ever a show required a big visual statement its this 
one said ralph koltai the hungarian designer responsible for the 
illfated carrie and a frequent collaborator at the royal 
shakespeare company you couldnt do metropolis on an empty 
stage with a chair 
judy kuhn who makes her west end debut as the saintly maria 
said this show is about machines its about what man has created 
as long as technology helps the show its ok its technology 
for its own sake thats the problem

if one had to sum up the quickchange artistry of 
jerome robbins broadway in one word that word might be 
velcro 
the way velcro opens and closes at a touch helps make it possible 
for two dressers to whiz actor jason alexander through a 10second 
costume change thats all the time it takes for him to turn from an 
ancient roman in a funny thing happened on the way to the forum 
into a 1912 dandy for high button shoes 
one of the secrets of how alexander who has the lead role of the 
setter can change so fast is that his highbutton shoes dont 
button to save time theyre rigged with zippers 
i think the audience loves quick changes its like magic to 
them said barbara matera owner of barbara matera ltd the shop 
that made the costumes 
velcro a fabric with a surface of clinging pile is a very big 
word in our vocabulary said the shows supervising costume 
designer joseph aulisi 
with nearly 400 costumes in the show and with a cast of 45 doing 
18 numbers there are lots of magical quick changes every night in 
fact there are so many of them that sometimes the entire cast is 
backstage whipping clothes off and on he said twenty dressers help 
because the criticallyacclaimed show is a pastiche of old 
broadway musicals that robbins has either directed or choreographed 
or both theres enough variety to send a costume maker reaching for 
a headache powder 
the musicals are as disparate as the king and i set in siam 
in the 1860s and west side story set in manhattan in the 50s 
matera recently talked about some of the quickchange tricks 
besides velcro and zippers she and aulisi employ to help the singers 
and dancers assume identities from 11 different times and places 
one trick is to dress the cast members in layers that peel off to 
reveal the costume for the next number but for dancers its not 
too comfortable to perform under bright lights as well as layers of 
fabric 
another behindtheseams secret is to line clothes with a 
slippery fabric so they slide easily on and off 
and some belts arent what they appear to be on stage theyre 
not threaded through belt loops but sewn right onto the pants if 
a costume consists of various parts you have to sort of bash them 
all together matera said 
barbara matera ltd has about 30 employees most of the time but 
has given work to as many as 100 people at one time when theres a 
lot to do 
while the company was costuming jerome robbins broadway it 
also did a fulllength version of swan lake for the american 
ballet theater and the road company versions of anything goes 
and into the woods 
costume work is seasonal and yearround jobs are few the new 
york theatrical sourcebook lists 55 costume craftsmen and 20 
costume shops in manhattan and brooklyn however only four or five 
of the shops are highly regarded mainstays said carrie robbins 
master teacher of costuming at new york university and a freelance 
costume designer 
most costume shop employees are drapers or a designers 
assistant tailor or finisher and do not make much money if they 
land a fulltime job they make about 1800026000 
they do it because they love theater and love making 
costumes said robbins 
its not a soft job either 
you go to sleep with bloody hands its very tiring on your 
hands and your arms and your shoulders said maggie raywood the 
workroom supervisor at parsonsmeares ltd another of the top 
costume shops 
parsonsmeares employees should know theyre the ones who made 
the costumes for the broadway musical starlight express in 
which the traincar costumes starred as much as the cast did 
parsonsmeares found unusual fabrics and invented new constructions 
for the costumes which looked like metal but moved like leotards 
the getup for one starlight character even incorporated a 
strobe light which the actor could flash by bringing together his 
forefinger and thumb the back of the glove was made of rubber to 
protect him from shock 
the designs were worked up from scratch 
however in the case of jerome robbins broadway the designs 
already existed aulisi said he recreated the originals as 
faithfully as possible matera said in some cases they were aided by 
the discovery of the designers old renderings with swatches of 
fabric still stapled on 
however aulisi said jerry was quite concerned that the show 
be relevant to the 80s so some stretch fabrics were used to give 
an 80s fit and style that emphasized the dancers bodies 
one thing that didnt change from the original show was the 
beaded silk organza butterfly that decorates the crotch of a 
stripper tessie in a number from gypsy 
matera went to some lengths to recreate it even calling upon the 
actress who originated the role on broadway maria karnilova for 
advice matera wanted to make sure it flapped the way it did in the 
1959 production like karnilova the actress now appearing as 
tessie faith prince makes the butterfly move with a grind of the 
hips 
its weighted in a certain way matera said it doesnt 
exactly flutter it sort of bumps

if stocks are headed for an extended bear market 
a large group of presumably savvy investors is going to be proved 
wrong 
these people top corporate executives directors and major 
shareholders have been voting consistently with their checkbooks 
lately for higher stock prices in the months and years ahead 
the insider buying of the last 16 months is the strongest 
sustained buying trend on record says editor norman fosback in 
the current issue of the insiders a newsletter that tracks the 
activities of what it calls americas most knowledgeable 
investors 
the word insider has been associated with a lot of illegal 
tarding activity in recent years 
what fosback and a good many other analysts track however are 
purchases and sales that top corporate officials report to 
regulators in compliance with the rules 
these people tend to be longerterm investors rather than 
traders since the law provides that they can be forced to give up 
any profits on shares of their own companies held for less than six 
months 
since insiders acquire much of their holdings through private 
means exercise of stock options for example their public 
activity naturally involves more selling than buying 
fosback figures that the normal level of purchases is 35 
percent of total transactions 
according to his calculations insider buying has been above that 
norm since early 1987 it soared to an unprecedented high after the 
crash in october 1987 and has settled down in the neighborhood of 
50 percent over the past year or so 
the insider indicator simply shows no letup of insider 
buying fosback said until the indicator eases down into the 
selling zone below 35 percent expect most market surprises to be 
pleasant ones 
skeptics about the usefulness of this indicator point out that 
insiders were enthusiastically buying through the weeks and months 
that led up to the crash in the fall of 1987 
fosback who readily acknowledged at the time that the insiders 
completely missed the crash says the experience showed that 
this indicator like all others cant be considered infallible 
but the idea of tracking insider transactions gets an 
enthusiastic endorsement from peter lynch the celebrated manager of 
the fidelity magellan fund in the recently published book one up 
on wall street he wrote with john rothchild 
theres no better tipoff to the probable success of a stock 
than that people in the company are putting their own money into 
it lynch writes 
when insiders are buying like crazy you can be certain that 
at a minimum the company will not go bankrupt in the next six 
months 
long term theres another important benefit when management 
owns stock then rewarding the shareholders becomes a first 
priority whereas when management simply collects a paycheck then 
increasing salaries becomes a first priority 
since bigger companies tend to pay bigger salaries to 
executives theres a natural tendency for corporate wageearners to 
expand the business at any cost often to the detriment of 
shareholders this happens less often when management is heavily 
invested in shares 
lynch does not advocate using insider purchases as an indicator 
for quick trading profits indeed he does not advocate seeking 
quick trading profits at all since he does not think it feasible to 
try to outguess what the market as a whole is going to do 
instead he advocates concentrating on choosing stocks of 
companies that have good business reasons why they might gain 
greater popularity in the future on wall street 
thus he says if the stock prices drops after the insiders 
have bought so that you have a chance to buy it cheaper than they 
did so much the better for you

sallie bingham insists she doesnt want pity 
but her book passion and prejudice a family memoir knopf 
2295 an account of the binghams of kentucky and her role in the 
breakup of one of the last great newspaper dynasties in the nation 
reads like a 500page plea for sympathy 
i dont want anybody to feel sorry for me i would think that 
was ridiculous she said in a recent interview i mean i think 
that they might feel regret that the bingham family behaved the way 
they have to feel sorry for me would be ludicrous because having 
this money gives me all kinds of wonderful opportunity that most 
people would never have 
the money to which bingham referred is the 62 million she 
received when her father barry bingham sr announced in 1986 that 
he was selling the family holdings the courierjournal and the 
louisville times newspapers a louisville tv station and a printing 
company to settle family squabbles over control of the empire 
the bingham family is to kentucky what the kennedys are to the 
rest of the nation their great wealth and good works gave them an 
almost mythical status in the state the courierjournal which has 
won eight pulitzer prizes was distributed throughout kentucky and 
had national influence for many years it was ranked among the top 
10 newspapers in the country the family had a liberal reputation a 
strong civil rights record and spent millions and millions on arts 
education and conservation 
bingham 52 whose announcement that she wanted to sell her 15 
percent share of the holdings was believed to have been the genesis 
of the family dispute rejected the familys buyout offers as too 
low and held out for an outside offer passion and prejudice is 
her attempt to remove the villain label cast upon her since her 
father sold the papers to the gannett co for a reported 4358 
million 
she said she finds it a little bewildering that the family with 
whom she is now very publicly estranged holds her responsible for 
the dissolution of the empire 
as you know i was a minority shareholder she said so 
its a little impossible for me to accept responsiblity for the sale 
of those companies that was really fathers decision but 
people seem to want to seek a scapegoat which is what i see 
happening to women a good deal in her book she said she didnt 
know he had decided to sell the papers until a reporter telephoned 
her at a restaurant and read her the press statement 
her memoir contends that for generations the bingham men have 
muzzled the bingham women relegating them to serving tea and 
planning cocktail parties while the patriarchs ruled the 
communications empire 
although many of her claims of male chauvinism might be justified 
her brother barry bingham jr demanded in 1983 that all the 
bingham women resign from the companys board of directors or he 
would resign as publisher of the papers the feminist rhetoric she 
espouses in the book and in her interview sounds less like 
impassioned belief than windowdressing to conceal a vendetta 
against the rest of the family for myriad grievances 
since passion and prejudice was published last month the 
other members of the bingham family her brother mother and sister 
her father died last august have retorted with an impressive 
document mailed out to book reviewers nationwide chronicling what it 
claims are some 300 errors in the book 
some of the errors the bound and painstakingly appendixed 
document cites are petty and sniping such as one pointing out that 
the authors reference to her brothers blond mustache in a 
particular passage is incorrect because he didnt grow it until 
later 
others are more serious in her book bingham says her parents 
asked her to return to editing the papers book page a job shed 
held briefly while the regular editor took a short leave of absence 
she accepted and the editor was reassigned to another position the 
bingham document states that it was sallie bingham who pressured her 
father into transferring the book page editor so she could 
permanently have the job 
in fact shirley williams the book page editor who lost her job 
has filed a libel suit against bingham and her publishers claiming 
that the false intentional and malicious passage has damaged 
her professional reputation williams is now a reporter for the 
courierjournals indiana weekly bingham would not comment on the 
lawsuit but said her lawyers are reviewing it 
the sections of passion and prejudice that most offend the 
family are sallie binghams account of her grandfather judge robert 
worth bingham she believes the judge as he was always called had 
syphilis and suggests in a surprisingly unsubstantiated chapter that 
he may have hastened the death of his second wife mary lily kenan 
flagler heiress to the standard oil fortune and at the time the 
richest woman in the united states the 5 million the judge 
received from a codicil to her will enabled him to buy the 
newspapers 
bingham now lives in prospect ky where she devotes her time to 
the kentucky foundation for women an organization that funds arts 
projects that promote social change either overtly or covertly 
she started the foundation three years ago bankrolling it with 10 
million of her fortune 
she also edits a literary quarterly she started the american 
voice which she calls a radical feminist publication she said she 
tells contributors send us the essay you thought no one would 
ever publish 
despite her life of wealth sallie binghams life has not been 
easy her oldest and youngest brothers worth and robert bingham 
died in freak accidents only two years apart in the mid1960s and 
she had two failed marriages as she struggled with a fiction and 
playwriting career before meeting her third husband 
i dont think any amount of money can save you from 
experience she observed

the proposed merger of publishing giant time inc 
with entertainment heavyweight warner communications inc could 
produce a media hypermarket for advertisers and authors 
just as retail hypermarkets offer everything from groceries to 
garbage cans under one roof a time warner conglomerate could create 
a onestop market for books films magazines records and cable 
television 
in theory at least the deal would enable an advertiser in people 
or sports illustrated magazines to get his product placed in a 
warner bros film or in a syndicated lorimar program like alf 
and then buy commercial time on the movie videocassette or on the 
new companys huge cable outlets 
an author published in hardcover by a time book company may be 
offered a deal that includes selling paperback film and music 
rights to warner and the television rights to warners lorimar unit 
any movie or tv programs that result from the book could then 
debut on times home box office or cinemax cable networks 
but media and marketing analysts warn that what sounds workable 
in theory may not be so easy in practice they said the magazine 
records film cable book and television syndication operations for 
time and warner have operated fairly independently over the years 
and wont likely cooperate without firm signals from top corporate 
management that they do so 
some of the things that strike one as obvious are not 
probable said j kendrick noble media analyst for painewebber 
he noted that time has offered a package deal of discounts for 
advertisers in its magazines but never extended it to time on its 
82 percentowned cable system american television and 
communications corp 
and he said established authors generally can make more money 
selling rights to their work in different media separately rather 
than in a package 
more likely noble said is that times expertise in direct 
marketing could be used effectively to sell warners videocassettes 
and records 
david fulton media director for the advertising agency fcbleber 
katz partners said rupert murdochs news corp owns television 
stations newspapers and magazines in the united states but still 
hasnt put together a package that advertisers have been 
successfully able to use 
john gray top media planner at ad agency j walter thompson in 
new york said gannett co has also tried with limited success 
to sell packages of space in its newspapers and billboards and time 
on its radio and tv stations 
fulton said whether size proves a significant advantage to 
attract advertisers depends a lot on the degree to which time 
warner becomes centralized rather than decentralized and the 
wishes of top management 
but will the new bosses speak with one voice on that issue 
according to the merger plans announced march 4 the new company 
will initially have cochief executives and cochairmen j richard 
munro from time and steven j ross from warner 
both munro and ross were said to be unavailable for comment on 
their plans for the new company by weeks end 
in their surprise announcement time and warner said they had 
agreed to merge in an exchange of stock that would create the 
worlds largest communications company with revenue of 10 billion 
company officials said the combination would help them compete 
against foreign giants in what is becoming a global communications 
market 
they denied that the merger was designed as a takeover defense 
but analysts say the the deal could do just that 
but there was speculation that a third party could emerge to 
derail the deal by bidding for either company in the months it will 
take for regulatory authorities to review the deal before the merger 
can be completed 
in other major business and economic developments this past week 
eastern airlines filed for protection from its creditors under 
chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws citing a sixdayold strike 
and losses of 4 million a day eastern can still sell billions of

a couple of flotation cushions a slice of wing 
or a coneshaped metallic nose can make for interesting garden 
sculpture and spell satisfaction of sorts for some of eastern 
airlines bondholders 
now that the strikecrippled carrier is operating under 
bankruptcy court protection hard assets may be the bondholders 
best hope for repayment with more than 15000 creditors in line for 
cash 
roughly 25 percent of easterns total liabilities of 41 billion 
are in the form of equipment trust certificates which as the 
name implies are backed by equipment 
holders of these issues commonly used by transportation 
companies can repossess easterns planes under certain 
circumstances if the carrier defaults on its interest payments 
out of a gamut of creditors ranging from ticket holders to 
employees in demand of paychecks trust certificate holders are 
clearly in a favorable position said mike singer director of 
research at rd smith amp co a firm specializing in the securities 
of distressed companies 
unlike unsecured creditors and shareholders whose financial 
exposure is not backed by collateral and are therefore last in line 
to get paid if a company defaults trust certificates are good 
for bondholders because they have a pool of equipment to back them 
up if there is a liquidation said raymond neidl a senior 
securities analyst at mccarthy crisanti amp maffei inc 
the market reflected that optimism when a company seeks chapter 
11 protection from its creditors bond prices generally are knocked 
down and under these stressful circumstances major bondrating 
agencies are prompted to lower their ratings on debt securities 
further adding to the downward momentum of prices 
but although both moodys and standard amp poors lowered their 
ratings on much of easterns debt there was little backlash 
bond traders apparently had jumped the gun pushing easterns 
debt issues down as much as 10 percent in value in the weeks leading 
up to the chapter 11 filing so when the news came thursday that 
frank lorenzo chairman of eastern parent texas air corp was 
sending eastern into bankruptcy protection bond trading was 
relatively unaffected 
there were a lot of lowball bids but there were no takers 
neidl said indeed easterns secured and unsecured bonds lost only 
2 percent to 4 percent of their face value that day not an erosion 
that dealers and analysts would consider significant 
thats because the bankruptcy filing was not exactly a total 
shock singer said furthermore there is a lot of value in 
eastern one way or another so its securities should only drop so 
far from a psychological aspect but the fundamentals show that 
creditors will get meaningful values for their bonds just how much 
will be determined by the bankruptcy proceedings 
based on its assets eastern might be worth as much as 355 
billion according to some analysts estimates the figure includes 
the carriers 250plane fleet valued at roughly 25 billion 
lorenzo and other eastern executives have worked doggedly at 
press conferences and in interviews to make assurances that all 
creditors will be paid their efforts have had at least some calming 
effect 
there is a fear however that eastern blood may spill onto its 
corporate parent texas air and sister carrier continental the two 
main wall street debtrating services announced they are keeping a 
sharp eye texas air and continental for possible downgradings 
moodys said easterns bankruptcy filing has an uncertain 
effect on each company and noted the possibilty that texas air 
could be drawn into the proceedings 
for eastern bondholders however the situation does not appear 
terribly grim analysts said the next stage is to see how 
successful lorenzo is in rebuilding eastern neidl said

about a quarter million lands end customers 
recently got something extra besides catalogs or the clothing theyd 
requested from the mailorder company 
they received letters warning them that possible changes in the 
way state sales taxes are collected could jeopardize the convenience 
and raise the cost of shopping at home 
in an attempt to rally consumers to its cause lands end urged 
customers to write their senators or representatives in washington 
and obligingly provided a sample letter and a list of every states 
delegation to the house of representatives 
the lands end mailings are the latest salvo in a longsimmering 
squabble pitting many mailorder merchants against local storefront 
retailers who contend the direct mail outfits gain an unfair 
advantage by not having to collect most state sales taxes 
the tensions have been escalating in recent years as mail sales 
have mushroomed the proliferation of tollfree 800 numbers changes 
in lifestyles growth in the number of people holding 
nationallyrecognized credit cards and an assortment of 
technological and demographic trends have boosted the direct 
marketing business 
mailorder sales volume totaled 112 billion in 1987 according 
to industry estimates up 12 percent from 1986s 100 billion the 
business is expected to expand at similar rates in future years 
surpassing the more modest growth of instore sales 
at issue is the salestaxfree status of some merchandise sent 
through the mail ranging from apparel ordered from traditional 
catalog companies to trinkets bought from television purveyors 
fortyfive states and washington dc have sales taxes on their 
books along with use taxes that theoretically give them the 
right to charge sales tax when their residents buy something outside 
their homestate borders and bring it home to use it 
for practical purposes the use taxes have not been enforced 
except in circumstances spelled out in a 1967 supreme court decision 
the court held that a vendor cannot be required to collect taxes 
from an outofstate customer unless the seller has a business 
presence in the state 
this is why retailers like sears roebuck and co or jc penney 
co inc that run mailorder businesses and have stores nationwide 
charge taxes on most mailorder goods while companies like lands 
end do not lands end only has to collect sales tax for the states 
of illinois iowa and wisconsin the places where the dodgeville 
wisbased company has offices or warehouses 
attempts have been made over the years to empower states to 
require more mailorder outlets to collect taxes on shipments made 
to customers in other states 
various legislation has been proposed on the subject in past 
congressional sessions but none garnered enough backing to push 
them into law 
but this session of congress may be different one bill that 
would augment states taxcollection powers already has been 
introduced in the senate and another is expected soon in the house 
of all the issues currently facing state governments the use tax 
matter is one on which there is true consensus says james l 
martin director of statefederal relations for the national 
governors association 
he said the states lost an estimated 29 billion in revenue in 
one year recently because they couldnt enforce the use tax fully 
enough capturing the unrealized tax revenue which is rising by at 
least 10 percent a year is appealing to states that have watched 
funding from federal sources dwindle 
but the revenue element is given secondary billing to competitive 
issues by a broad coalition that is lobbying to broaden state 
taxcollection power besides state governments the coalition 
comprises groups of retailers and organized labor 
retailers see it as an unfair playing field says martin 
main street retailers are paying all sorts of taxes such as 
property and they also must collect the state sales taxes 
our basic premise is that its important to level the tax piece 
of the playing field martin says 
direct marketers dont see it that way they contend they would 
be burdened with costly administrative duties such as setting up 
systems for tallying sales tax charges and publishing lists of state 
sales tax rates in their catalogs 
many companies wouldnt be able to afford the cost according to 
robert levering of the direct marketing association 
previously proposed legislation exempted from tax collection 
tasks any mailorder operations that sold less than 125 million 
worth of merchandise a year that would include about 95 percent of 
all us direct merchants 
but levering said the threshold could inhibit growth of small 
outfits and hurt midsize to large direct merchants already 
operating on thin margins 
for mailorder shoppers the use tax could have some annoying 
consequences 
people who pay for merchandise by check would have to calculate 
sales tax when they send in their money for instance an estimated 
56 percent of the 88 million customers each year who shop through 
catalogs pay by check 
that inconvenience would come on top of possibly higher prices as 
mailorder companies upgrade their systems to handle tax collection 
in the end mailorder companies will have to pass these 
expenses along to you the lands end letter to customers 
statedyou will pay higher prices

dan fleming wants to ship west coast garbage to 
the marshall islands which he says would keep the dots of dry land 
in the south pacific from being submerged by rising water from the 
greenhouse effect 
but environmentalists say the plan is just a way to make a profit 
by unloading garbage on a poor country 
fleming admits he thought the idea was total insanity when he 
first heard it now hes pushing it as vice president of admiralty 
pacific inc whose principals claim to have seven contracts already 
to take compacted trash from washington oregon and california 5000 
miles to the pacific island chain 
in an interview with the seattle postintelligencer from his 
office in san francisco fleming refused to identify the parties to 
the seven contracts but said some were private trash haulers and 
landfill operators 
under the plan starting in 1990 compacted municipal waste 
nothing hazardous or toxic would be loaded on ships in seattle and 
then used to fill lagoons in the island republic he said 
despite the global warming anticipated from the greenhouse 
effect and the resulting melting of polar ice and rising of sea 
levels by several feet the islands would thus remain above water 
the marshalls would get 16 million a year for accepting the 
garbage admiralty pacific would make about 22 million a year and 
the garbage problems of the west coast would be solved if the plan 
works 
some think the project is total insanity and so did i when i 
first got involved in it fleming said 
admiraltys proposal is part of a whole grim scheme of 
things said ann leonard a researcher for the environmental group 
greenpeace a lot of these exports are increasing as a result of 
the high costs of waste disposal 
she said the plan seemed to follow a pattern in which private 
companies offer lots of money to a poor country to take waste thats 
too expensive to dump in the united states 
their desire for cash is going to outweigh any environmental 
impacts leonard said they are forced to make a choice between 
poison and poverty 
fleming explained that the garbage would be spread in a 12acre 
warehouse and swept with electromagnets to extract iron and steel 
workers who paid admiralty pacific for the privilege would then 
scour the refuse for aluminum and the remaining trash would be 
compressed into oneton bales and wrapped in plastic 
hazardous household materials like solvents cleansers paints 
and batteries would hopefully be removed by the electromagnets 
or the handpickers but im not going to tell you its perfect 
fleming said there just arent any guarantees in life 
the bales would be carried on ships with doublelined hulls and 
landfills in the marshalls would be lined and include plumbing to 
siphon off any leaching materials he added the leachates would be 
burned as fuel since theyre usually petroleumbased he added 
fleming said he could make a profit while paying 50 a ton for 
garbage a third to a quarter of the hauling costs paid by many 
cities 
he added that it would cost about 20 million to build port 
facilities at majuro capital atoll of the marshalls and home to 
about half the republics 31000 residents 
majuro has 25 square miles of dry land the entire republic 
comprising two chains of small islands has 72 square miles of land 
the marshall islands depend heavily on us aid through rent for 
a military base and compensation for damage from atomic bomb testing 
in the 1940s 
admiralty pacific president james a thompson who was in the 
marshall islands during world war ii has been toying with the 
project for about two years fleming said 
thompson listed on incorporation documents as the president 
secretary treasurer registered agent and only director of 
admiralty pacific did not return telephone calls thursday fleming 
said there were other directors but refused to name them 
fleming said he and other investors were willing to spend as much 
as 3 million for an environmental impact statement to assure the 
republic that the dumping would be safe while increasing the land 
mass of the islands five times in two decades 
a letter signed in october by marshall islands president amata 
kabua granted admiralty pacific an exclusive arrangement but 
telephone interviews with other officials indicated some confusion 
about how it was being handled 
robert kelen general manager of the republics environmental 
protection authority said he would review the impact statement and 
make a recommendation to the presidents cabinet on whether to 
accept the proposal

the average price of a twodoor nissan pathfinder 
sportutility vehicle will increase 1500 effective monday because 
of a higher tariff on the japanesemade vehicle the company said 
friday 
thomas d mignanelli executive vice president for operations of 
nissan motor corp in usa said in a news release that the 
company will absorb some of the higher tariff but most of it would 
be passed on to the customer 
on feb 16 the us treasury department issued a list of 
vehicles it classified as trucks and subject to a 25 percent duty 
and cars for which importers had to pay a 25 percent tariff 
the twodoor pathfinder fell in the truck category 
we regret being forced to take this action mignanelli said 
friday but the treasury departments decision left us no 
recourse nissan still believes the ruling is an unnecessary and 
unwarranted tax on consumers 
nissan continues to hold out the possibility that production of 
the twodoor pathfinder could be moved from japan to the companys 
plant in smyrna tenn removing the tariff charge 
but company spokesman bill pauli said friday no decision has been 
reached on that 
a fourdoor version of the pathfinder which the treasury 
department classifies as a car and subject to a 25 percent duty is 
to be introduced in late autumn or early winter pauli added

the world bank offered the country 1 
billion for electric power development the planning ministry said 
friday 
the banks representative for brazil armeane choksi proposed 
the loan in a meeting thursday with planning minister joao batista 
de abreu the ministry said 
last year the world bank suspended payment of an approved 500 
million loan for the electric power sector after brazil put its 
nuclear program under the aegis of the state electric company 
the bank questioned the economic feasibility of the proposed 
angra iii nuclear plant which hasnt been built yet however many 
brazilian believe the real problem was environmental concerns 
regarding the nuclear plant and proposed hydrolectric dams in the 
amazon rain forest 
the suspension of the loan led foreign private banks to withhold 
600 million in new loans part of an 822 billion loan package 
approved last september the new money was tied to the release of 
the world bank loan 
president jose sarney has vowed to cut government spending as 
part of an economic reform program announced jan 15 to halt 1000 
percent annual inflation 
abreu called the offers positive and stressed the importance 
of reversing the negative flow of funds from brazil to the world 
bank the government currently pays the bank more than it receives

wall street analysts are worried that the stock 
market will soon have to cope with more troublesome news on 
inflation 
but at the same time they note that stocks have stood up pretty 
well of late to the challenge of all the negative talk about the 
inflation outlook 
the government is due to report friday on the producer price 
index of finished goods for february this gauge of inflationary 
pressures startled many investors when it took a 1 percent jump in 
january 
another stiff increase 06 percent seems likely in the 
february report says the current merrill lynch market letter 
higher interest rates probably will slow inflation eventually 
but were likely to see more unpleasant numbers before the tide 
turns 
the presumption that the tide will indeed turn sooner or later 
appears to have helped to keep inflation worries from inflicting 
much damage on the stock market to date 
when the labor department reported friday that the unemployment 
rate fell to a 15year low in february it sent out a strong signal 
that a longpredicted slowing of economic growth had not yet 
materialized 
the news was not well received in either the stock or bond 
markets but neither one suffered any dramatic selloff 
we believe that the concern about wage and capacity pressures 
is overblown said michael sherman at shearson lehman hutton inc 
we are not forecasting a decline in the inflation rate at this 
time but nor are we expecting an acceleration 
for the year as a whole sherman predicts that the inflation rate 
will run in the 4 percent to 4 percent range 
most stock traders seemed to take a similar view in the past 
week even with the news of strongerthanexpected employment growth 
on friday the dow jones average of 30 industrials managed to post a 
785 gain to 228214 for the week 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 95 to 16485 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market gained 
191 to 40590 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was up 270 at 32892 
volume on the big board averaged 15980 million shares a day up 
from 15566 million the week before 
the recent flareup of inflation worries recalls a similar scare 
last summer that was induced largely by drought in many agricultural 
areas of the country observed donald carver president of centre 
square investment group in philadelphia 
in the current environment inflationary concerns appear 
somewhat premature he said while price pressures bear 
watching we expect economic activity to begin to decelerate 
gold is trading near its lows a sign that inflation 
expectations are not very high 
despite recent surprises in the statistics an economic 
slowdown is clearly in the cards maintains john connolly at dean 
witter reynolds inc 
this is obviously what the federal reserve has in mind and we 
believe the fed has the determination to make it happen the only 
questions are when it will occur and from what interestrate level 
activity later this year will be burdened by the full brunt of 
the recent interestrate increases so it is increasingly likely 
that some month soon will show a definitive slowdown 
the bond market would love to see a slowdown connolly 
concluded and stocks would respond to any rally in bonds

an attorney for 1700 steelworkers at the 
geneva works when it was owned by usx corp has told a federal judge 
the company defrauded the workers when it reneged on a promise to 
keep the mill open through 1989 
wyoming attorney gerry spence on friday presented arguments on 
one of three pretrial motions in a 1987 lawsuit in which the 
steelworkers claimed to have lost wages severance pay and insurance 
and pension benefits when usx sold the orem steel mill to a utah 
company 
us district senior judge bruce jenkins courtroom was crowded 
with about 300 steelworkers who listened as several attorneys argued 
the merits of usxs motion for a partial summary judgment 
usx sold geneva to basic manufacturing technologies of utah in 
august 1987 13 months after the aging plant had been shut down by a 
labor dispute and subsequently placed on indefinate idle status 
by usx 
the plant has operated since then under the name geneva steel 
the plaintiffs cited a 1986 letter mailed to every geneva worker 
from usx chairman david roderick who assured them the utah plant 
would not close its doors until the end of 1989 
they contend the letter superseded a collective bargaining 
agreement between the workers and the united steelworkers of america 
because it was an independent contract between roderick and each 
individual worker

companies like eastern airlines usually file for 
bankruptcy protection after years of losses but some of the most 
prominent chapter 11 filings over the past decade have been by 
companies running in the black 
when texaco inc the nations thirdlargest oil company asked a 
federal bankruptcy court to protect it from creditors in april 1987 
it was solvent so was manville corp when it filed for bankruptcy 
reorganization in august 1982 and ah robins co inc when it filed 
in august 1985 
the difference between these cases and the more common bankruptcy 
court filings by companies going broke is the three firms were 
trying to avoid the possibility of future financial ruin from 
massive legal claims 
by filing under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law a 
company can reorganize its business protected from claims by 
creditors including legal claimants 
texaco filed for bankruptcy protection because of a 103 billion 
judgment won against the oil giant by pennzoil co in 1985 pennzoil 
had charged texaco with interfering with pennzoils plans to acquire 
getty oil co 
texaco said it filed for protection to avoid having to post a 
potentially devastating 11 billion security bond required under 
texas law during the appeals process 
but more importantly the filing put pressure on pennzoil to 
settle the dispute 
without a settlement texacos reorganization could have become a 
drawnout process and pennzoil might not have seen any money for 
years with their 3 billion agreement the reorganization plan was 
wrapped up a year after texacos filing 
manville and robins each were facing thousands of claims from 
individuals manville from people made ill by its asbestos 
products and robins from women injured by its dalkon shield 
intrauterine birth control device 
both companies said they would be wiped out if they had to pay 
all the claims facing them their filings were a form of damage 
control 
manvilles bankruptcy court filing was considered novel when it 
was first made the company emerged from bankruptcy protection last 
november its reorganization plan provided for up to 200000 
asbestos claimants to share in a 3 billion trust fund set up to 
compensate 
the robins plan which is pending provides 25 billion to 
settle nearly 200000 claims 
none of these companies had lost money because of the claims 
against them 
eastern however had verged on a bankruptcy filing for years 
the airline said in court papers it had lost 102 billion this 
decade it listed 45 billion in assets 339 billion in 
liabilities and 15696 creditors 
the bankruptcy filing was triggered and complicated by a walkout 
by mechanics pilots and flight attendants a week ago 
at first blush easterns filing may seem totally different from 
cases like texaco manville or robins but richard daveni a 
professor at dartmouths college amos tuck school of business 
administration saw some similarities 
a bankruptcy filing is leverage whether its used by a company 
like texaco seeking an advantage over a single opponent or by a 
firm like eastern trying to work its way out of a tangle of red 
ink daveni said 
its one way to bargain with and reallocate the power among the 
stakeholders daveni said in an interview 
thats the purpose of the bankuptcy law he said 
even in a manville or robins situation where a company is facing 
thousands of claims a filing forces the company and creditors into 
negotiations in such cases thousands of claimants against a 
company are joined into a class represented by the same attorneys 
in a case like texacos the bankruptcy law has another advantage 
it can be used as a way around the heavy financial penalties meted 
out by antitrust laws daveni said 
he considered it likely that more companies would file under 
chapter 11 when faced with claims similar to those faced by these 
companies 
he was right it happened again this past week 
raytech corp a manufacturing holding company filed for 
protection from creditors on friday the company has been named a 
codefendant in more than 1000 lawsuits brought by people claiming 
to have been injured by asbestos used in the past by one of the 
companys businesses

anxious to protect itself from potential 
asbestos liability claims arising out of a past business raytech 
corp on friday filed for protection from creditors under chapter 11 
of federal bankruptcy laws 
this is not an issue of failing businesses but rather one 
related to getting the structure issues resolved in a single 
courtroom with national jurisdiction said craig r smith raytech 
president and chief executive officer 
raytech a multinational manufacturing holding company based in 
shelton conn said in a prepared statement that it was forced to 
take its voluntary action in us bankruptcy court in bridgeport 
conn because all other potential avenues for resolution of the 
issue in the courts have proven to be ineffective or impossible 
the bankruptcy action involves only the holding company and not 
any of its manufacturing subsidiaries raytech makes specialty 
engineered products for industrial auto aerospace and military 
customers in addition to the united states it has plants in west 
germany puerto rico and japan 
the filing was the lastest in a complex case in which raytech has 
sought to avoid involvement in any costly asbestos lawsuits 
raytech was formed in 1986 in a bid to shelter the assets of 
raymark industries inc from asbestosrelated lawsuits raytech 
acquired assets from raymark in 1987 but as part of the agreement 
raymark agreed to protect raytech against all asbestosrelated 
liabilities 
shareholders approved the deal as about 30000 lawsuits filed by 
former employees were pending against the company raymark a 
stratford company had used asbestos in brake linings 
asbestos fibers when inhaled permanently scar lung tissue in a 
progressive and debilitating condition known as asbestosis lung 
cancer and heart disease also have been linked to inhalation of 
asbestos fibers 
al canosa raytechs vice president said the chapter 11 petition 
seeking protection from creditors while the company reorganizes 
listed 26 million in assets and said total liabilities were 
unknown and disputed 
despite the maneuver to protect its assets raytech has been 
named a codefendant with raymark in more than 1000 lawsuits the 
action taken friday will force the court determine whether asbestos 
claimants have a legal right to seek damages from raytech the 
company said 
in february an involuntary bankruptcy petition was filed against 
raymark which resulted in raytechs loss of indemnification by 
raymark 
we paid raymark industries fairmarket value for the assets 
acquired and we did not acquire any assets or businesses that gave 
rise to asbestosrelated claims smith said 
it is our belief and has been from the time of restructuring 
that raytech would be free from any asbestosrelated liabilities 
flowing from past businesses of raymark industries he said 
raytech has no insurance coverage for asbestosrelated 
liabilities and smith said the lawsuits threaten the future 
existence of raytech 
raytech which manufactures fastners and inertia control 
products had a net income excluding unusual items of 77 million 
on sales of 1273 million in 1988 that compared with earnings of 
66 million on sales of 1324 million a year earlier 
manville corp another large company who used asbestos in its 
products in 1982 filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy when faced with 
thousands of absestos lawsuits the company formerly the nations 
largest asbestos producer emerged from bankruptcy protection in 
1986 after a reorganization plan established a 25 billion fund for 
asbestos victims

soon after adding eastern airlines to his 
collection of wayward carriers texas air corp chairman frank 
lorenzo boasted in 1986 that he had envisioned the possibility of 
eastern seeking bankruptcy protection 
to prevent the drain of texas air assets to eastern in times of 
need the man who shrunk continental airlines and broke its unions 
after a similar takeover devised a setup keeping eastern financially 
independent of its parent 
he bragged that the only ties between the airlines were texas 
airs initial cash outlay and some dividends guaranteed after four 
years but he predicted thrashing and changes in those four 
years implying those 1990 payments wouldnt ever happen 
eastern could go into chapter 11 and it would not affect what 
we do lorenzo said according to a transcript of a december 1986 
meeting with pilots having said that i dont think the easterns 
going to go into chapter 11 i think the unions are going to 
negotiate because i think they realize that the last place they want 
to be is in chapter 11 
of course the aggressive machinists union didnt negotiate and 
was joined by pilots in a walkout eastern claims forced it to seek 
protection from creditors under chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law 
last week 
critics say lorenzo the onetime wonder boy of the airline 
industry unions now label a robber baron isnt fazed by the 
prospect of bankruptcy after a 17month managementlabor slugfest 
they say chapter 11 may indeed be the last place the unions want 
to be because it gives lorenzo a chance to bust them and slash the 
assets of an airline 25 billion in debt possibly consolidating 
eastern and continental 
and they detect a pattern in frank lorenzos 20 years in the 
industry the piecemeal acquisition of components in building the 
dominant megacarrier in the age of deregulation 
to lorenzo making money not sentimental attachments to 
airlines like eastern one of the nations four original majors is 
what has mattered 
he is in the money business not the airline business in the 
airline business you have to be peopleoriented said paul gibson 
jr an american airlines vice president in the 1970s and 
early1980s who now practices law in new york 
how did lorenzo the 48yearold son of spanish immigrants 
manage to build texas air from a tiny intrastate flier mockingly 
dubbed tree top airlines into the nations largest carrier 
lorenzo and a harvard business school classmate pooled about 
2000 in 1966 to form jet capital corp an aircraft leasing company 
lorenzo critics say was little more than an excuse for an office in 
new yorks pan am building 
tiny jet capital in 1972 bought a controlling interest in trans 
texas airlines renamed it texas air international thanks to a 
single border hop into mexico and lorenzo became president 
lorenzo exploited federal regulation to get loans for planes to 
expand texas airs fleet long before deregulation the airline 
offered discount rates lorenzo called peanut fares and got 
national attention 
in 1978 lorenzo tried to acquire national airlines then a major 
carrier the action triggered a bidding war among the major 
airlines and pan am eventually outbid rivals for the airline but 
not before lorenzo made about 40 million from the sale of national 
stock 
it was a fear of deregulation and pan am had to get a domestic 
route system said one longtime airline industry official with no 
love for lorenzo it literally wrecked the airline 
in 1980 lorenzo tried to buy trans world airlines and formed 
nonunion new york air to compete with eastern on the east coast 
the empire grew 
the postderegulation era was one of the shakiest in the 
industry but in 1982 during a time of high fuel costs airline 
consolidation and low passenger demand lorenzo grabbed beleaguered 
continental which lost 100 million the year before and its 
midwest strength for 100 million 
despite cash reserves of about 80 million lorenzo took 
continental into bankruptcy in 1983 abrogated union contracts cut 
staff by twothirds flew through a strike and emerged with a 
nonunion airline and the ire of labor 
he was one of the first to recognize that in order to reduce 
fares he had to reduce costs from the traditional cost structures of 
the ailines labor supplies and debt financing said james carey 
research vice president for airline economics inc in washington 
in 1985 lorenzo made unsuccessful passes at twa and frontier 
airlines 
a year later with continental still in bankruptcy court texas 
air snatched foundering people express with its newark nj hub 
and the assets of people express subsidiary frontier which provided 
a denver base for about 300 million the eastern deal for 676 
million followed shortly 
industry sources said lorenzo bought eastern to get the final 
piece of the puzzle a computerized national reservation system 
that he transferred to texas air for a bargain price of 100 
million one source said eastern was offered 350 million for the 
computer system alone 
his critics say lorenzos goal then was to get concessions from 
easterns unions and pare down the moneylosing carrier even more 
eastern sold its kansas city mo hub last year and with court 
approval plans to sell the northeast shuttle to donald trump and 
gates and routes from philadelphia 
bankruptcy protection allows lorenzo the chance to reduce labor 
costs even more by seeking to dissolve union contracts on the 
grounds that eastern was propelled into court by the pilots walkout 
he moves stuff around and he tries to build houses of cards 
one critic said even when theyre collapsing as in bankruptcy 
hell find some new and novel way to exploit it further its as if 
the collapse was planned 
lorenzo defenders say he exploited industry turmoil following 
deregulation in 1978 and cannily crafted the megacarrier he sought 
if at the expense of tens of thousands of jobs stranded passengers 
and unpaid creditors 
with deregulation and the ability to shift assets and merge and 
acquire with relative freedom what frank has been doing is probably 
part of a general trend in this country said carey of airline 
economics 
the big distinction you make with lorenzo and airline 
managements is he is more of a specialist on the art of the 
financial side what trump calls the art of the deal than most 
managers who have a history and background in the airline he 
said 
lorenzo would agree 
the issue he said last week after eastern filed for chapter 
11 is fundamentally whether a troubled and sick business in a 
competitive marketplace should be allowed to change itself and 
manage its survival
