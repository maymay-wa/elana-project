music publishers filed a class action lawsuit 
on monday against the sony corp claiming the manufacturers 
digital audio tape machines promote illegal home taping of music 
the lawsuit filed in federal court in new york city seeks to 
block the importation and sale of the sony dat equipment the 
sophisticated machines which yield near perfect duplications of 
recorded music went on sale in the united states last month 
sony is not the sole exporter of the machines but leads the 
field 
this equipment was truly designed and intended for the purpose 
of infringing copy rights said marvin frankel an attorney 
representing an estimated 40000 songwriters and 450000 copy 
rights 
virtually everybody who is likely to buy this equipment will 
be using it for infringement purposes frankel said 
a call made after hours to sony headquarters in new york was 
unanswered 
the lawsuit states that sony is inaugurating a new era in 
unauthorized home taping of copyrighted musical compositions 
the japanese electronics giant the suit alleges is actively 
promoting the ability of dat recorders to make perfect digital 
copies of compact discs 
the suit cites a recent survey sponsored by a music industry 
trade organization showing that dat owners intend to use the 
equipment to tape prerecorded music 
unlike analog tape recording machines digital technology 
provides for immaculate duplication of compact discs and of 
subsequent generations of dat cassettes 
the complaint asked the court to find that unauthorized dat 
taping violates the federal copyright statute the suit maintains 
such taping hurts sales of compact discs cassettes and records 
costing the industry substantial copyright revenues 
the lawsuit names sony corp sony usa inc and sony corp of 
america as defendants it was filed on behalf of sammy cahn jac 
music co inc fort knox music inc trio music co inc and teer 
international inc 
the announcement of the lawsuits filing was made at the annual 
meeting of the national music publishers association edward 
murphy president of the organization said the group will offer 
assistance to the plaintiffs in the lawsuit

a roman catholic candidate for the state 
legislature has been asked to resign from the parish council of his 
church because he supports womens right to abortion 
monsignor william odonnell of our lady of lourdes church in 
bethesda md said monday he had already accepted the resignation 
of john hurson who is seeking election in a district where 
abortion is a major campaign issue 
hurson denied that he had resigned 
odonnell said he asked hurson to quit the parish council 
because his position was contrary to the teachings of the 
church 
its as simple as that whats the big deal odonnell said 
hurson said he opposes abortions but does not believe the state 
should pass laws against abortion 
richard dowling spokesmen for the maryland catholic conference 
said this was the first time a public official or candidate in 
maryland or the district of columbia had been disciplined for 
taking a prochoice stand on abortion 
hurson criticized church officials for trying to quell dissent 
on the abortion issue 
it seems to me that catholics need to have if they are going 
to serve in public office the freedom to represent everyone not 
just the catholic hierarchy he said 
i want to participate fully in my church and the inability 
to do that is very painful one should not have to put ones 
religion in low gear just because you decided to run for public 
office he said 
hurson a lawyer is running as a democrat on a ticket headed by 
patricia sher one of the leaders of the abortion rights forces in 
the maryland house of delegates 
sher is giving up her house seat to run in the primary against 
democratic state sen margaret schweinhaut who supported a 
filibuster in the senate last march that blocked passage of a 
strong prochoice law 
hurson said he talked with odonnell twice last week to discuss 
his abortion stance he was told friday that he would have to 
resign 
i told him you realize theres going to be some publicity 
about this hurson said he said oh yes

researchers already are complaining 
about censorship at richard nixons presidential library which 
opens this month 
the privately run library will lack a full set of memos letters 
and other documents from nixons white house years because the 
originals are in government custody and nixon has chosen to copy 
only those he considers important to the library 
who knows what the nixon people have screened out said 
stanley kutler a wisconsin history professor who recently 
published a book on the watergate scandal 
the librarys director hugh hewitt said every document of any 
importance including many relating to watergate will be in the 
library 
he also said the library will pick and choose researchers and 
that pulitzer prizewinning watergate reporter bob woodward 
probably would not be allowed to study there 
hes not a responsible journalist hewitt said 
woodward now the washington posts assistant managing editor 
for investigations said the suggestion that he or others would be 
kept out demonstrates that the library will be part of a 
continuing coverup

call it just us folks this new weekly 
program on cable television channels across the country but it 
wont be a ratings threat to the simpsons or to americas 
funniest home videos 
this show is intentionally mundane 
rep dave mccurdy dokla and a band of moderate democrats say 
they will take to the house floor regularly to correct what they 
say is a public misperception the mainstream forum as they 
call themselves hopes to show that democrats are plain folks not 
what mccurdy derisively calls the screamers of the extreme 
right and left 
i might even talk about my kids making the allstar team in 
baseball or softball he said 
the idea is to show voters that their democratic congressmen are 
much like themselves calm thoughtful people who share their 
concerns about tax fairness crime budget reality and the 
countrys security he said 
we will not be as wild in our rhetoric or as provocative or 
daring or outright hostile mccurdy added we are not going to 
disparage individuals or personalities thats part of the 
message we want to show people were not extreme were not 
crazy 
joining him will be lawmakers like barbara kennelly of 
connecticut john spratt of south carolina mike espy of 
mississippi louise slaughter of new york and tim penny of 
minnesota 
mccurdy and his allies are members of the democratic leadership 
council an organization of moderatetoconservative democrats 
formed to try to move the party toward the right into what they 
see as the countrys mainstream 
the idea of using the house floor and its video connection to 
hundreds of thousands of viewers after business hours first came 
to the republicans it was newt gingrich and his conservative 
opportunity society who began staging issues discussions in 1984 
democrats thought it was silliness thenspeaker thomas p 
tip oneills response was to order the tv cameras to pan the 
chamber and show that the intenselooking gop debaters were 
actually speaking to an empty house 
but the televised mock debates did have an impact democrats 
were portrayed night after night as not caring about issues like 
the federal budget deficit and ignoring matters such as school 
prayer abortion and the lineitem veto and they began to be 
concerned that people might actually believe it 
the partys next response soon abandoned was to consider a gag 
order that would limit how many hours could be devoted to the 
afterhours talkfests known as special orders in the 
meantime gingrich of georgia rode his tv visibility to become 
house gop whip the no 2 leadership position 
later an informal group of democratic activists mostly 
liberals began meeting to define and refine a public message for 
the party they worked mostly through newspaper reporters 
columnists and tv commentators however 
then mccurdy and about a dozen other democratic moderates 
decided it was time to fight fire with fire and won the 
acceptance if not the blessing of speaker thomas s foley dwash 
weve got news for the minority whip and his minions 
mccurdy announced in the maiden broadcast late last month their 
free ride is over were not going to let them define us anymore 
nor the oklahoman added in an interview will that job be left to 
party liberals or interest groups 
that mccurdy should now seize upon using the house floor 
available in more than 50 million homes through the cspan cable 
network is taken as a compliment by gingrich he even hopes the 
two opposing sides can be turned into a kind of pointcounterpoint 
we always thought that something like our use of cspan was 
inevitable and it was good that its healthy gingrich said 
weve always encouraged democrats to come over and debate because 
its just a lot more fun 
we are basically taking a page out of gingrichs book 
mccurdy concedes im of a different generation than oneill 
who brushed aside the gop tv tactic cable tv has become a 
powerful voice

a nearly forgotten fungus is proving to be 
deadly on voracious gypsy moth caterpillars and may be the weapon 
that stops them from destroying trees nationwide 
its such a brandnew phenomenon that we really know little 
about it said joseph elkinton a professor of entomology at the 
university of massachusetts and the states chief gypsy moth 
researcher we didnt even realize the fungus existed until last 
year 
elkinton and his counterparts in connecticut southern vermont 
and new york said that they had expected to be hard hit by the 
caterpillars this spring instead they found healthy trees and dead 
and dying caterpillars infected with the fungus entomophaga 
maimaiga 
up to 90 percent of the caterpillars in some areas of western 
massachusetts that elkinton checked were wiped out by the japanese 
fungus the fungus was introduced in boston in 1910 in the hope of 
imposing a natural control on the gypsy moth 
the hairy brown caterpillars of the gypsy moth a european 
species have been munching on american oaks and other hardwoods 
since some escaped from a french naturalist who was experimenting 
with silk worms in medford in 1869 since then they have spread 
across the country to the pacific major defoliation has been 
reported this summer in pennsylvania new jersey virginia west 
virginia maryland ohio and michigan according to the us forest 
service 
but while it took only 20 years after the moths release in 
massachusetts for the first major infestation to be reported it 
was more than 80 years before the fungus was noticed last summer by 
researchers in connecticut and identified by ann hajek of cornell 
universitys boyce thompson institute 
initially we thought it was because of the extremely wet 
spring last year she said but that hasnt been true this year 
in new york and we are still seeing it 
may was wetter across most of the region but june when the 
caterpillars began dying off from the fungus was not elkinton 
said ronald weseloh a researcher at the connecticut agricultural 
research station agreed 
studies of the rise and fall of gypsy moth caterpillar 
populations in massachusetts which has been charting their raids 
for more than a century showed they do well in dry years and die 
off in wet ones we never knew why but the fungus may be the 
answer hajek said 
armed with soil infected with the fungus hajek introduced the 
fungus to an area around ithaca ny where it killed caterpillars 
this spring 
so we know it can be brought into a new area effectively 
she said but there is still a lot to be learned about its spread 
and effectiveness

us officials are stopping short of denying a 
report of plans for a uscoordinated military attack on drug 
lords in south america but say there has been no change in the 
policy of not involving us forces in direct operations 
newsweek reported saturday it has obtained briefing papers from 
us southern command headquarters in panama that envision an 
attack coordinated by the southern command and using the armies of 
colombia bolivia and peru to attack drugtrafficking targets in 
those countries 
national security adviser brent scowcroft said on cnns 
newsmaker sunday that it would be a real misnomer to refer 
to the operations as a big drug raid as suggested by an 
interviewer 
us troops will be used the same way theyve always been 
used he said that is when asked for they will help train 
local military they will not be used operationally in 
interdiction and intelligence for example in tracking and so on 
yes we will use the military as we have been doing it all along 
asked whether the reported operation signals an escalation of 
the drug war scowcroft said no well hopefully its an 
intensification its not an escalation 
defense secretary dick cheney did not respond directly when 
pressed on cbs face the nation to comment on specifics of the 
newsweek account 
i suppose you could argue that at present youve got a 
situation where the military units in those countries are actively 
involved in fighting the drug cartel and we are actively involved 
in supporting them by coordination and support and 
assistance he said

other 6 percent were in the unknown or unreported 
categories

miss oregon pageant contestant lisa verch 
says if she wins dont drape her in mink 
rival beauty queens boast hobbies like collecting photos of 
elvis or porcelain dolls hugging dad gourmet cooking and 
horseback riding 
on her fact sheet verch 22 said her hobby is promoting the 
ethical treatment of animals 
her uncompromising animal rights activism puts her at odds with 
a pageant sponsor schumacher furs which has awarded miss oregon 
winners a mink jacket for 28 years 
im committed so much to animal rights that i would do 
anything rational and legal to support the cause said verch a 
member of students for the ethical treatment of animals at the 
university of oregon 
that stance does not go over well with bill schumacher a 
longtime sponsor of the pageant to be held thursday through 
saturday in seaside 
if one of them decides to turn down the mink coat he said 
ive got a packet of information that can show them how the 
synthetics theyre using in their tap shoes evening gowns and 
swimsuits are also hurting the environment 
miss oregon officials said verchs views will not be held 
against her 
we plan on letting the contestants say what they want to 
say pageant president mike maki said as for our sponsor 
well cross that bridge when and if we get to it 
by her own admission miss lane county 1990 is an unlikely 
beauty queen calling herself a sweat shirts and jeans kind of 
gal who rarely wears makeup and is a vegetarian 
verch said she considers the 6000 in scholarships that go to 
the pageant winner a good way to finance a masters degree in 
journalism 
another incentive is the publicity that she could bring to 
animal rights issues if she won the state contest and prevailed at 
the miss america pageant in september each miss america promotes a 
cause during her reign 
her moral stand was praised by game show host and former miss 
usa and miss universe pageant emcee bob barker who in 1987 quit in 
protest because officials refused to halt fur coat giveaways 
shell be admired by thousands for her convictions and is a 
marvelous example of where americas young people today are heading 
in their views said barker a champion of animal rights 
leonard horn executive director of the miss america pageant 
said the organization would not put any restrictions on the topic 
the winner chose for her platform 
verch who works as an intern at radio station kezi in eugene 
will perform a piano medley of bartok and bach 
she said if shes crowned miss oregon shell use the position 
to lobby her cause in the state capital while serving as the 
states official hostess a position designated by the legislature 
20 years ago 
but dont expect her to show up in a fur coat 
it goes against my personal values and beliefs in things that 
i support every day of my life she said

the power of an odor to stimulate memory 
familiar to anybody who has suddenly thought of a longlost lover 
after getting a whiff of perfume or cologne has proved itself in a 
research laboratory 
college students who smelled chocolate during a word exercise 
and again the next day when asked to remember their answers did 
better than others denied the memoryevoking aroma 
such an odorbased memory strategy could help students studying 
for multiple exams or airline pilots training for emergencies said 
researcher frank schab 
his work provides the first firm scientific evidence that odors 
can help bring back memories said brian lyman of the monell 
chemical senses center in philadelphia 
schab who did the experiments while at yale university now 
does psychological research at the general motors research labs in 
warren mich he presents his results in this months issue of the 
journal of experimental psychology learning memory and cognition 
people seem to believe from their own experiences that odors 
are special in the sense that they can recall very vividly events 
from 20 30 years ago schab said 
lyman said that unlike sights or sounds odors are processed 
through the brains limbic system which is involved in emotions 
that might help odors bring back memories with emotional overtones 
he said 
in one experiment 72 yale undergraduates were presented with a 
list of 40 common adjectives and told to write down the opposite of 
each word they were not told that the next day they would be asked 
to recall as many of the words they had written as they could 
each student was exposed to a chocolate smell either during the 
word exercise only during the later recall test only on both 
occasions or on neither all students were told to imagine the 
smell of chocolate on both occasions 
those who were exposed to the smell of chocolate during the word 
exercise and again in the recall test recalled an average of 21 
percent of the words they had written that was significantly 
better than the best average from the other groups 17 percent 
a followup experiment showed that the same odor must be present 
upon learning and testing to get a memory benefit no gender 
differences appeared in the effect 
schab also found that chocolate and mothball odors worked 
equally well suggesting that the pleasantness of a smell does not 
affect its power to stimulate memory 
such research has many potential applications schab said 
students studying for exams in several subjects simultaneously 
might benefit from using a different odor for each topic he said 
and using a particular odor when training pilots to handle an 
emergency and again when that emergency occurs might bring back 
a lot of information about how to do things what to do next what 
to look for schab suggested 
the experimental results fit a hypothesis widely accepted by 
psychologists that some details about the environment in which a 
person learns something are stored in the brain along with the 
learned material such details can then be used to help retrieve 
the material the hypothesis says 
for example research shows students do better in exams if they 
take them in the same rooms in which they learned the material 
lyman said 
schab said he is now investigating whether odors work better 
than other potential memory cues such as music sounds or the 
rooms in which the learning occurred

a man accused of dunking his 2yearold 
stepson headfirst into a toilet goes on trial on murder charges 
this week in a case that raised questions about social workers 
failure to protect the toddler 
prosecutors will seek the death penalty for thomas coe who told 
police he was punishing bradley mcgee for soiling his diaper the 
boys death brought unprecedented charges against four social 
workers one of whom was convicted of child abuse 
if nothing else all this has made caseworkers be more careful 
to realize theyre making lifeordeath decisions here said pam 
kirkland the boys foster mother before he was returned to coe and 
the mother who abandoned him with every child they have to stop 
and ask could this be the next bradley mcgee 
coe 23 goes on trial tuesday in fort myers defense attorneys 
have acknowledged the dunking but say coe did not intend to kill 
the boy so it wasnt murder 
we just want to make sure that if hes convicted he gets 
convicted for the crime he committed said attorney robert 
norgard 
the case grew beyond domestic violence as bradleys road from 
abandonment to foster care and ultimately back into the hands of 
his troubled parents made him a symbol of failings in the states 
social services system 
the boy was under the supervision of the state department of 
health and rehabilitative services from the time he was 4 months 
old after his mother abandoned him at a shopping mall with a 
pretzel vendor 
he died of head injuries july 28 1989 two months after a judge 
followed an hrs recommendation and ordered the child returned to 
his stepfather and mother sheryl mcgee coe 
the death prompted the legislature last fall to allocate 39 
million for more child protection workers legislators also changed 
the law to make child safety not family reunification the social 
services agencys top priority 
according to coes statements to investigators the dunking came 
during potty training when bradley dirtied his diaper 
after mrs coe took bradley out in the yard and hosed him down 
coe took him into the bathroom grabbed the boy by the ankles and 
dunked him in the toilet bowl 
plunger style a detective wrote 
when bradley refused to stop screaming he was put under a cold 
shower then led down the hall to the living room 
coe said he and his wife then hit the staggering bradley in the 
head with pillows until he suddenly stiffened collapsed and curled 
into a fetal position efforts to revive him failed 
both parents were charged with firstdegree murder and 
aggravated child abuse mrs coe 21 pleaded no contest earlier 
this year to seconddegree murder and is serving a 30year prison 
term 
coe is described by relatives as a brooding angry young man in 
constant pain from a congenitally crippled hip and hereditary 
kidney disease 
in statements to prosecutors mrs coe said the toiletdunking 
was the culmination of a pattern of abuse by her husband against 
bradley she claims he urinated on the child put cayenne pepper on 
his genitals and dunked him in the toilet at least once before 
defense attorneys argue coe dunked the child to discipline him 
not to harm him 
within weeks of bradleys death charges were filed against four 
state social workers three were cleared before bradleys main 
caseworker margaret barber 62 was convicted last month of child 
abuse and placed on three months probation 
ms barber had recommended that the boy be returned to his 
parents without showing the court a psychological report that 
described the coes as explosive infantile and unable to care for 
children 
i still lay awake at night and wonder how it could have 
happened how it all could possibly have been prevented said 
ms kirkland who cared for bradley for 14 months theres no way 
i can put it out of my mind

his security and that of his krahn tribal supporters is guaranteed 
the president has shown no sign he plans to depart soon 
doe has been deserted by most of his cabinet ministers the two

greek and us officials have signed a 
defense treaty allowing two major us military bases to remain in 
the country for at least eight more years 
the treaty signed sunday also guarantees defense of greeces 
territory against any hostile country including neighbor and 
fellow nato ally turkey 
greece and turkey came to the brink of war in 1974 when turkey 
invaded cyprus following an athensbacked coup on the island in 
march 1987 the allies again came close to war over oildrilling 
rights in the aegean sea 
the accord which came after 19 rounds of negotiations and three 
changes of government in greece must be ratified by the greek 
parliament and the us congress if the treaty is ratified it 
could go into effect by september 
greeces governing conservatives control 151 seats in the 
300seat parliament the majority needed to ratify the agreement 
this document provides a firm foundation for continuing our 
bilateral defense relationship on mutually acceptable and 
beneficial terms and will contribute to the strength of nato 
defense secretary dick cheney said after the signing 
greek foreign minister antonis samaras and us ambassador 
michael sotirhos signed the treaty which can be extended by mutual 
agreement on an annual basis after it expires 
a draft letter to congress calls for 345 million in aid for 
greeces purchase of us military equipment it also proposes that 
greece receive surplus materiel worth about 1 billion samaras 
said 
the united states also would waive 50 million owed by greece 
for past military purchases 
a previous fiveyear defense agreement expired in december 1988 
seventeen rounds of negotiations involving the former socialist 
government of andreas papandreou produced no treaty 
the papandreou government with its frequent antiwestern 
rhetoric and links to such radical arab leaders as libyas moammar 
gadhafi did not enjoy much favor in the united states 
coalition governments after june and november elections last 
year put the bases issue on hold 
the conservative government elected april 8 and the united 
states reached agreement in principle on may 30 after two rounds of 
talks 
the treaty covers two major us military bases on the southern 
island of crete a naval support facility at souda bay and 
iraklion air station near the village of gournes 
a naval communications station at nea makri and hellenikon air 
base both near athens are to be closed to save money

fire today destroyed a shinto shrine dedicated to 
protected sacred rice being grown for the november coronation of 
emperor akihito police said they suspected arson by antiimperial 
radicals 
farleft groups have vowed to disrupt the coronation 
criticizing it as a remnant of japans prewar emperorcentered 
nationalism 
no one was in gogokuji shrine when the fire broke out the akita 
prefectural police said a police official who spoke on condition 
of anonymity said three batteries and an aluminum can were found 
nearby suggesting the fire was set 
the three main wooden buildings of the shrine 280 miles north 
of tokyo were destroyed the official said the fire was 
discovered by police on patrol before dawn 
police have been keeping a close watch on the shrine since akita 
was chosen by palace officials as one of two prefectures where 
sacred rice would be grown for use in rites accompanying the 
coronation 
the sacred rice is to be used in the daijosai or great food 
offering ritual to be conducted ten days after akihitos 
coronation on nov 12 
in that rite legend says the new emperor communes with the 
gods shinto japans indigenous religion is based on nature 
worship shamanism and elaborate ceremonial rites 
although the daijosai will not be an official state function 
some opposition parties have said state funding for it violates 
constitutional principles that separate church and state

the worlds livestock industry is closely 
watching britains mad cow disease situation for signs of a 
beef turnoff in europe and possibly other major meatconsuming 
countries 
although the disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy or bse 
has not been known to exist in the united states the agriculture 
department and state agencies are keeping watch 
the disease attacks the central nervous system and is fatal to 
cattle department officials say there has been no scientific 
evidence to date that it is a human health hazard 
a report by the departments economic research service said 
recent decisions by france germany and italy to stop imports of 
british beef and cattle lasted only for a week 
but the shortlived ban highlighted animal health issues as the 
12member european economic community moves ahead in its 
ambitious program to eliminate internal borders by the end of 
1992 the report said 
such restrictions are contrary to eec law it said but 
the bans were lifted after intensive negotiations signifying 
another victory over national interests 
all beef with bones and live calves shipped from the united 
kingdom to other eec countries must be certified that they are from 
bsefree herds boneless beef doesnt require certification 
since 1986 when the first cases were confirmed 14000 cattle 
have contracted bse in the united kingdom 
a number of british schools have stopped including beef in 
school meals the report said beef prices are depressed in 
britain and ireland and the eec commission has decided to open 
intervention buying of uk beef to help support prices 
the report was written by economists mary lisa madell and david 
kelch of the usda agency and published in the july issue of 
agricultural outlook magazine 
madell said further in a telephone interview that so far bse has 
been found only in the united kingdom none has been reported on 
the continent although some cases have been reported in ireland 
but she said there are people advising not to buy british 
beef and that this has been of some growing concern to consumers 
and producers alike 
outside the eec countries austria and the soviet union have 
banned imports of british ruminants which include sheep as well as 
cattle saudi arabia and qatar have stopped taking cattle and beef 
from the united kingdom 
australia new zealand israel and canada have banned imports of 
cattle from the united kingdom 
the usda has prohibited imports of live cattle and zoo ruminants 
from the united kingdom since july 1989 and embryos and semen can 
be imported only with special certifications 
a us import ban on sheep and goats has been in place for many 
years because of the existence of scrapie in england scrapie is a 
disease of sheep and is similar to bse some scientists suspect bse 
was transmitted to cattle through feed containing meat of sheep 
infected with scrapie 
madell said if the disease problem in britain affects beef for 
pet food it could help boost us exports of those products 
but i wouldnt say that the situation in england is going to 
produce a big demand for us beef in europe she said i dont 
think its going to open up major markets

an agriculture department economist says 
japans resistance to opening its door to rice imports has deep 
roots 
the united states has been pressuring japan to abandon its 
policy against rice imports as a step toward trade liberalization 
william coyle of the departments economic research service said 
japans agricultural policy is woven into the countrys culture 
but coyle added in the july issue of farmline magazine that some 
changes are taking place as urban dwellers ties with the 
countryside weaken the yen appreciates in relation to other 
currencies and ruralurban competition for land intensifies 
coyle also noted some differences japan has 24 people per acre 
of cropland compared with 12 in the united states 
japan has 4 million farms averaging 325 acres each compared 
with 2 million averaging 463 acres in the united states 
in terms of value rice is the most significant japanese crop 
followed by livestock products both meat and milk vegetables 
and fruit japan is accustomed to importing foods other than rice 
and about 70 percent of the livestock feed is imported 
japan has had a policy of being selfsufficient in rice since 
the 1940s at the beginning of world war ii japan was a rice 
importer and many older japanese remember the food shortages 
during and immediately after the war

imports of beef and veal are expected to 
increase only slightly if at all this year according to 
agriculture department forecasts 
most of the imports come from australia and new zealand the 
departments economic research service said in a recent outlook 
report shipments from australia were larger than expected at the 
end of 1989 and at the beginning of 1990 
but those imports will likely decline during mid1990 because 
flooding has disrupted transport of cattle to slaughter in 
queensland where most of the beef shipped to the united states is 
produced the report said 
imports from new zealand probably will be down this year 
reflecting herd rebuilding and recovery from last years drought 
and herd liquidations 
last week usda estimated meat imports in the 1990 calendar year 
at 116 billion pounds compared with slightly more than 114 
billion pounds in 1989 the estimate covers meat primarily beef 
and veal subject to annual quota restrictions if it appears 
imports will exceed a trigger level 
the trigger for 1990 is more than 136 billion pounds meaning 
that actual imports probably will fall far short 
about a dozen countries supply quotatype meat to the us 
market but australia and new zealand are the main providers

jesse jackson did little to dampen 
speculation that he is considering another presidential run when he 
made a twoday swing through iowa to raise money for key backers of 
his 1988 campaign 
jackson scored in the 1988 precinct caucuses by building links 
between liberal farm activists and the states small minority 
community he said he can do that again 
both of you have been taken advantage of and its time to 
come together jackson said at a picnic sunday with leaders of 
iowas farmers union which supported him two years ago the event 
was cosponsored by a black activist group 
im delighted to be here with friends again jackson said 
weve been through triumph together we work together now 
but to persistent questions about his presidential ambitions 
jackson replied no one can stop you from speculating it 
happened that our invitations neatly converged 
during his weekend visit to raise money for state legislative 
candidate john norris the man who ran his campaign in iowa and 
gubernatorial hopeful don avenson jackson touched on rousing 
populist themes 
he told packed churches of a kind of virus of mindless 
materialism behind the nations drug crisis and savings and loan 
fiasco 
its root is greed we should have been focused as a nation on 
a higher vision jackson said 
if we can find 500 million for those savings and loan thieves 
we can rebuild america jackson said of the savings and loan 
bailout i say let those who had the party pay for the party 
jackson announced last week he would run for the post of 
shadow senator from the district of columbia the shadow 
senators will be unpaid lobbyists for washington dc statehood 
with no official duties 
democratic activists were less oblique about jacksons 
intentions for 1992 
jesse already has a certain cadre who will help him in any 
campaign in which he shows an interest said iowa democratic 
party spokesman joe shannahan its probably time that he touches 
base with his constituency 
jacksons visit comes as democrats stir in anticipation of 
trying to oust president bush in 1992 virginia gov douglas wilder 
visited the state last month and new jersey sen bill bradley is 
scheduled to visit iowa this summer the states precinct caucuses 
offer the nations first test of presidential strength 
we defied the odds in 1988 jackson said as he swung through 
greenfield in western iowa greenfield my home away from home 
the tone for the 1988 campaign was really set right here in rural 
iowa 
it was in that city that jackson decided to establish his iowa 
campaign headquarters although it was 60 miles away from des 
moines and most media outlets he said it symbolized his efforts to 
link the fates of struggling innercity workers and farmers facing 
a credit crunch 
jackson said he can link those groups again 
we must make room for each other we must stand together he 
said

death penalty opponents in the united 
states canada and europe are rallying behind a condemned former 
black panther claiming his case is an example of racism in capital 
punishment 
mumia abujamal of philadelphia is on pennsylvanias death row 
for the fatal 1981 shooting of a white police officer he was 
convicted in 1982 and exhausted his state court appeals last year 
his latest appeal petition filed in may is pending before the 
supreme court 
the case has become the rallying cry for opponents of the 
racist death penalty said rachel wolkenstein staff attorney for 
the new yorkbased partisan defense committee organizer of 
protests staged in london new york paris hamburg east berlin 
and toronto 
studies have shown that the death penalty is disproportionately 
applied to blacks hispanics the poor and the indigent 
among the inmates on death row 43 percent are black more than 
three times the percentage of blacks in the general population 
acording to the naacp legal defense and educational fund more than 
twice as many blacks who killed whites were executed since 1973 as 
blacks who killed other blacks according to the national 
association for the advancement of colored people 
a rally is planned for july 12 in sydney australia followed by 
others july 14 in philadelphia chicago and oakland calif 
petitions with 20000 signatures seeking a reprieve for jamal 
have been sent to gov robert casey along with a letter from the 
toronto labour council on behalf of 180000 trade unionists in 
canada 
this campaign has brought together a powerful array of 
forces who want an end to death sentences said gene herson 
rally chairman for the committee 
us rep ronald v dellums dcalif and actor ed asner are 
among those supporting a lesser sentence for jamal 
in addition to my hatred of the death penalty i know that 
mumia did not have a fair trial liberal attorney william 
kuntzler said during a june 28 rally in new york 
deputy district attorney gaele barthold said prosecutors would 
have no comment because jamals case is in litigation 
witnesses testified that jamal 36 shot officer daniel faulkner 
once in the back and four times at close range after the policeman 
stopped jamals brother for a traffic violation jamal was 
critically injured when faulkner returned fire and later recovered 
jamal formerly known as wesley cook was a member of the black 
panthers and later became a supporter of the radical group move and 
a follower of the rastafarian movement 
he was a radio news reporter known for his focus on social 
issues and served as president of the city association of black 
journalists he lost the radio job in a dispute over objectivity 
and was working as a taxi driver before the shooting 
ms wolkenstein contends jamal had been a police target for 
years 
hes on death row specifically because as a black panther and 
prominent journalist he spoke out against racist state 
repression she said 
john obrien recording secretary for the fraternal order of 
police lodge 5 said he had no knowledge of jamals having been a 
police target but he said the police union and its members would 
fight any attempt to overturn jamals death sentence 
as far as im concerned that man deserves to die he said 
he killed that man on purpose he could have left after shooting 
him once but no he came over and put another bullet in his head 
jamal who claims he did not shoot the police officer did not 
testify at his trial 
defense attorney marilyn j gelby has argued that the prosecutor 
improperly told jurors jamal would have appeal after appeal after 
appeal if convicted the state supreme court said the argument 
was permissible but the us supreme court reversed a similar 
ruling from mississippi in 1985 
such an argument is seen to mean that the jury is really not 
taking its responsibility for the death penalty ms gelb said

the pentagon has sent in advisers to help 
with an intensified antidrug effort that includes a sophisticated 
new intelligencegathering system a us drug enforcement official 
says 
bolivia an impoverished south american country of 7 million 
people produces onethird of the cocaine consumed in us and 
other foreign markets 
eugene castillo acting us drug enforcement administration 
attache for bolivia said a computer system recently installed in 
la paz and santa cruz will link major cocaine centers and provide 
data on trafficking 
it will also provide a safe way of transmitting information 
among antidrug operations centers he said 
castillo who spoke friday on condition the story would not be 
used before sunday described the new system as innovative 
it gives us intelligence and the ability to transmit that 
intellingence to affected areas so that operations can be planned 
and mounted in a minimum amount of time he said 
until now the dea and bolivian police have relied on korean 
warvintage radio equipment whose transmissions can easily be 
intercepted by drug traffickers who use the latest in radio 
communications equipment 
castillo said the us southern military command is also helping 
the dea and bolivian police formulate and maintain a countrywide 
operational strategy to prevent the production and export of 
drugs and the import of chemicals used in processing 
for about a month three military advisers one each from the 
us navy army and air force have been coordinating strategy 
with bolivian police and the dea at least 10 other special agents 
are training bolivian antidrug police 
the us military is prohibited by the bolivian and us 
governments from directly participating in any antidrug operations 
the military is only a support force castillo said all 
we are doing is using military expertise to assist us in 
intelligence gathering 
during a may meeting in washington bolivian leader jaime paz 
zamora and president bush agreed on greater military involvement in 
the antidrug war 
paz zamora agreed to commit 900 soldiers to the effort and to 
increase air force and navy involvement bolivian military 
personnel are already assisting police in antidrug activities 
in return bolivia was promised 75 million worth of military 
equipment and training for 19901991 
but the growing militarization of the antidrug war has created 
opposition in bolivia and raised concern that a largely peaceful 
police enforcement effort could escalate into civil wars such those 
in peru and colombia 
the participation of the military in cocaproducing zones 
is only producing violence said felipe caceres garcia a leader 
of the coca growers association of chapare the region the size of 
new jersey produces 80 percent of bolivian coca leaves the base 
for cocaine 
in bolivia there is no violence there is no terrorism and we 
do not want it to get to that caceres garcia said

mikhail gorbachev and trade feuds arent the only 
hot topics on houstons summit menu 
at the goode co barbq barn loyalists were simmering over the 
rival stuff the folks tasted at sunday nights presidential hoedown 
for his summit guests george bush probably would agree his 
favorite ottos wasnt served up either 
in houston barbecue is a serious subject and a neverending 
source of argument were the best boasted goode co manager 
tanguy libbrecht ottos is arguably one of the bestknown 
because george bush plugs it ive got nothing bad to say against 
luthers but everyone knows were the best 
luthers barbq a popular chain that sports redandwhite 
check tablecloths and curtains and boasts a taste as big as 
texas donated all the food at bushs summit feast for 5000 
people the spread included 1250 gallons of barbecue sauce 500 
pounds of onions and a jalapeno or two 
luthers president mike jolley naturally claims his barbecue 
is the best in the world but houston magazine awarded its blue 
ribbon to the goode co where deer heads rifles and longhorns 
hang on the walls and strains of country music fill the smoky air 
with tales of love won and lost 
jim woods 65 drove 20 miles across town to eat at goode co 
sunday night while foreign dignitaries dined in a building 
adjacent to the astrodome 
people talk about where the best barbecue is a lot woods 
said i think this is the best 
bush favors ottos which couldnt cater the rodeo because it 
couldnt handle a party that large but did send dinner over to 
barbara bush last week 
everyone does their own thing its all competitive and 
theres no badmouthing said marcus sofka who runs ottos 
none of the barbecue aficionados in a houston post survey of 
prominent houstonians favored luthers ottos was no 1 according 
to houston defense attorney richard racehorse haynes state gop 
party chairman george strake and japanese consul general yasuo hori 
sofka says his is supreme because he leaves the fat on the beef 
while it is slowcooked over wood and basted in sauce luthers 
trims some of the fat he said 
across town in one of the poorer neighborhoods thomas barbq 
gets high marks 
theres nothing fancy about this place just good beef said

to show why some of its more than 15 million works of art grace 
its walls and others hang on racks behind steel doors in

painting by jeanhonore fragonard and a copy by a contemporary and 
an authentic 8th century chinese figurine and a modern fake 
some works such as a wire cow with 3 legs by alexander calder

police hunted today for 
members of a rightwing white group that has claimed responsibility 
for a bombing that injured 27 blacks and is threatening more such 
attacks 
the group calling itself the white liberation army made the 
claim late sunday in a statement telefaxed to newspapers the 
bombing friday was one of at least six in johannesburg in the last 
10 days 
the message said the bombing at a central bus terminal used 
almost exclusively by blacks was to protest government plans to 
end whiteminority rule it was sprinkled with racial slurs and 
called law and order minister adriaan vlok a traitor 
earlier sunday vlok had announced the arrests of nine white 
extremists in connection with the series of bombings which were 
aimed at black and antiapartheid targets 
vlok called the nine men supporters of a farright political 
ideology but said they could not be linked to any specific group 
a police official said today that police were searching for 
members of the white liberation army the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said it was one of several extreme 
rightwing groups linked to recent attacks 
vlok said the nine detained men were being held under the 
internal security act which allows for indefinite detention 
without trial he did not say when they had been arrested 
among the nine were three prominent rightwingers leonard 
veenendaal darryl stopforth and david rootenberg vlok declined to 
name the others 
rightwing whites have vowed to fight president fw de klerks 
plans to end apartheid and share power with the overwhelming black 
majority 
both de klerk and the african national congress the leading 
black opposition group have acknowledged that a terrorist campaign 
by heavily armed whites extremists could undermine blackwhite 
negotiations 
the anc and other antiapartheid groups have criticized police 
for failing to solve any of the recent bombings but vlok said the 
arrests showed the government was moving against the white 
extremists 
officials believe the extreme right consists of only a few 
hundred people but security officials say even a handful of white 
terrorists could cause havoc south african press reports say up to 
45 extremeright groups operate in south africa 
government officials say the right poses a far greater threat 
than the armed struggle of the anc and other black organizations 
the anc campaign which began in 1961 was largely ineffective 
because of the groups internal problems and the superior strength 
of south african forces 
terrorism by whites is likely to be much more effective and 
dangerous security officials said nearly all white men receive 
compulsory military training guns and explosives are readily 
available to whites and the right has numerous sympathizers in the 
police and military they said 
it also is much easier for white extremists to operate without 
suspicion in a society with laws that give privileged status to 
whites 
the proapartheid conservative party says it plans to defy a 
government law requiring public facilities to open to all races by 
october the independent south african press association reported 
the measure the separate amenities act gave local governments 
and privatelyowned enterprises the right to reserve facilities for 
whites such as parks hotels swimming pools bathrooms and 
recreation centers

black leaders gathered at the naacps annual 
convention said winning passage in congress of a major civil rights 
bill is the groups top priority 
the bill is needed to restore rights that were kidnapped by 
the conservative majority on the current us supreme court 
naacp executive director benjamin l hooks said sunday in a speech 
opening a fiveday meeting of the nations oldest and largest civil 
rights group 
a vote for the civil rights act of 1990 is a vote for the 
continued emancipation of african americans hooks said a vote 
against the bill is a vote for economic and social enslavement and 
the denial of equal opportunity for african americans 
hooks said the national association for the advancement of 
colored people will launch a huge lobbying effort to promote 
passage of the legislation 
we will also apply these same efforts to ensure that president 
bush signs the measure he said 
the bill would reverse several us supreme court decisions made 
last year regarding the employment rights of women and minorities 
unless we are successful in reversing the supreme courts 
turnbacktheclock actions we may again find ourselves 
literally and figuratively on the back of the bus hooks said 
in a news conference before the meeting hooks complained that 
black elected officials have been subjected to selective 
prosecution and he called for uniform enforcement of the law 
he was particularly critical of the federal governments drug 
sting of washington mayor marion barry using a woman with whom he 
had an affair to lure him to her hotel room 
we feel that something is wrong with the system when millions 
of dollars are spent and over 70 fbi agents assigned to trail and 
monitor an elected official to set up a sting operation to bring 
him down and then to have americas chief law enforcement officers 
say afterwards that due to limited resources no criminal 
investigation will be launched against 1600 greedy savings and 
loan bank officials who have stolen over 500 billion hooks said 
hooks emphasized that the naacp does not condone misconduct by 
public officials but charged that black officials have been 
unfairly targeted for prosecution 
tremendous amounts of money and resources have been expended 
to hunt down every allegation innuendo rumor or hint of possible 
wrongdoing on the part of black elected officials he said 
overzealous hostile if not racist district and us 
attorneys will bring a black official to trial on the flimsiest 
evidence

plans to free a western hostage are 
likely to proceed despite israeli air raids in lebanon a source 
close to the leadership of the iranianbacked shiite moslem group 
hezbollah said today 
most of the 16 western hostages in lebanon are held by 
underground factions believed to be supported by the hezbollah or 
party of god hezbollah bases were the targets of air strikes in 
south lebanon today and sunday 
let us pray the israeli attacks will not scuttle efforts to 
free one of the hostages said the source speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
the hostageholders are definitely restless but i personally 
believe irans pressure will probably override the impact of the 
attacks he said 
irans official news agency had reported saturday that one of 
the western hostages in lebanon most likely a european would soon 
be freed 
on sunday israeli jets hit a hezbollah base three miles north 
of israels selfdeclared security zone today police said four 
phantom f4 fighterbombers rocketed hezbollah bases two miles 
north of sundays targets 
a source close to the command of the syrian troops in beirut 
said if the release does occur it is unlikely to be before the 
middle of the week the syrians were instrumental in working out 
the releases in april of two american hostages frank reed and 
robert polhill 
we havent been contacted yet about arrangements of the 
release it usually takes two to three days after such contact to 
have the hostage out the source said sunday speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
syria is lebanons main power broker it has 40000 troops in 
the country controlling 70 percent of its territory 
on sunday a source close to hezbollah said iran had decided to 
use its influence with the kidnappers to free one of the hostages 
and a scenario for the release was being worked out 
the decision was made in tehran to release the hostage the 
details on where when and how are now under consideration in 
lebanon said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the source would not speculate on who would be released or 
answer any other questions 
we have to wait for a communique from the kidnappers he 
said 
moslem fundamentalists accuse western governments especially 
the united states of bias toward israel and hold them responsible 
for israels actions against the arabs 
the hostages include six americans and 10 europeans the longest 
held is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
earlier a source close to the syrian army command said that if 
any hostage were released it would probably be brian keenan a 
belfast man who was traveling on an irish passport when abducted 
the irish red cross flew the first western relief plane into 
tehran after the june 21 earthquake in northern iran that killed 
about 40000 people 
shortly before the quake three irish parliamentarians visited 
tehran and held talks about keenan with iranian foreign ministry 
officials 
on their return to dublin the parliamentarians condemned the 
imprisonment of more than 300 lebanese shiites in the khiam jail in 
israels selfdesignated security zone in south lebanon 
release of these prisoners has been a major demand by the 
kidnappers of western hostages in lebanon

members of two lutheran congregations sang 
hymns and prayed to show their support of three homosexual 
ministers whose ordination led to an unprecedented church trial 
a disciplinary committee of the evangelical lutheran church in 
america expected to complete a threeday hearing today could 
expel the local churches for defying denomination rules by 
ordaining a lesbian couple and gay man the panel has until july 17 
to issue its decision 
at sunday services the rev john frykman pastor of first 
united lutheran church told his congregation that tolerance was 
the lords way members of st francis lutheran church heard and 
expressed a similar message 
jesus accepted everyone and we should accept everyone said 
erna dennert outside st francis 
the church with 53 million members is the largest lutheran 
body in the united states like other mainstream churches it 
forbids the ordination of sexually active homosexuals arguing that 
sex should be practiced only within marriage 
despite the ban the two local churches in january ordained 
three seminary graduates who were open about their homosexuality 
and refused to take a vow a celibacy 
jeff johnson 28 was named assistant pastor of united lutheran 
a predominantly heterosexual congregation of about 100 in the 
citys richmond district ruth frost 42 and phyllis zillhart 32 
a couple together for five years are at st francis a largely gay 
congregation in the castro district 
we have many gay and lesbian pastors in the church right now 
and there is no reason they should stay in the closet zillhart 
said sunday 
but sierra pacific synod bishop lyle miller who heads the 
church in northern california filed charges against the two local 
congregation and their pastors 
we are not convinced that living in homosexual 
relationships is what ought to be miller said sunday 
the ecclesiastical hearing which began friday marks the first 
time the church has sought to discipline a pastor or congregation 
since it was formed in a merger of three major lutheran groups in 
january 1988 
the 14member committee could censure first united and st 
francis suspend or expel them 
but frykman and the rev james delange pastor of st francis 
say they and their congregations are willing to be ousted to prove 
their support of the civil and religious rights of gay people 
all 13 other elca churches in san francisco have said they 
support the two defiant congregations and will maintain relations 
with them even if they are expelled frykman said

premeditated murder of seven palestinian laborers in a burst of 
automatic rifle fire refused to speak as his trial opened today 
judge chaim steinberg ruled that ami poppers silence amounted 
to a plea of innocent to charges he gunned down the seven arabs and 
wounded 10 others on may 20 outside tel aviv 
the massacre led to widespread riots in the occupied gaza strip 
and west bank and 13 other palestinians were killed by army 
gunfire in the three days after the mass slaying as soldiers tried 
to put down the violence 
before the plea was accepted poppers lawyer david ofek asked 
to be relieved of the job of defense attorney he cited in part the 
young mans refusal to communicate 
steinberg rejected okeks request and set the next court session 
for september 5 ofek later said he would appeal the tel aviv 
district court judges decision to the supreme court 
popper dressed in a white tshirt and black shorts remained 
silent throughout the onehour opening session 
the victims of the massacre were among about 50 unarmed arab 
workers waiting for day labor jobs in the tel aviv suburb of rishon 
letzion 
the charges say popper was armed with a galil assault rifle and 
forced the workers to sit in rows then stopped a passing vehicle 
and ordered its occupants to join the others 
all of a sudden the accused aimed his weapon in the direction 
of the workers and started firing incessantly the charges say 
popper who is from rishon letzion was arrested shortly after 
the slayings 
at the time authorities described popper as deranged and 
distraught over an unhappy love affair 
ofek later maintained popper was trying to kill one man among 
the 50 laborers he said the intended victim was one of five arabs 
who sexually assaulted popper when he was 12 
poppers family first said they had never heard of such an 
assault but later said the suspect began to act strangely at the 
time of the alleged molestation 
ofek had argued that popper was unfit to stand trial but a 
panel of five psychiatrists found he was able to understand the 
charges 
in court today popper spent most of his time staring at the 
ceiling during the proceedings before a threejudge panel 
consisting of steinberg david benofir and edmond levy 
ofek who was appointed by the court said he could not defend 
popper because of the youths silence and because he was unable to 
find a psychiatrist willing to perform the further examination of 
his client he feels is needed 
in rejecting ofeks request to be removed from the case 
steinberg promised the courts aid in finding a psychiatrist 
willing to examine popper

israeli jets rocketed guerrilla bases of 
the proiranian hezbollah militia today in their second raid in 22 
hours on south lebanon bases of the shiite moslem fundamentalist 
fighters 
one hezbollah fighter was killed and 11 people five combatants 
and six civilians were wounded in the raid said a police 
spokesman who cannot be named under standing rules 
in two runs spaced over 10 minutes four f4 fighterbombers 
rocked the bases in the villages of loweizeh and melita which are 
two miles north of sundays targets 
it was israels third raid on targets in lebanon in four days 
and 15th this year police said leaping flames and palls of black 
smoke hung over the targets in iqlim altuffah or the apple 
region southeast of the port city of sidon 
in jerusalem the israeli military said the targets 15 miles 
north of the border were bases for organizing and launching 
attacks against israel 
it said all its planes had returned safely but gave no other 
details 
both loweizeh and melita are traditional strongholds of 
hezbollah or party of god and overlook the northern flank of 
israels selfdeclared security zone 
hezbollah confirmed the new strikes in a statement issued in 
beirut and said they were followed by massive artillery bombardment 
of the two villages from israeli positions in the security zone 
after sundays raid hezbollah fighters fired three 
surfacetosurface missiles toward northern israel 
early today israeli artillery hammered suspected guerrilla 
hideouts in the foothills of mount hermon 
military helicopters illuminated the rugged mountain slopes with 
parachute flares as longrange guns on the israeli border pounded 
the villages of ein atta and kfeir in southeastern lebanon before 
dawn police said 
in sundays raid israeli warplanes destroyed a hezbollah 
snipers nest and ammunition depot on a hilltop between the 
villages of jarjou and ein bouswar 
police said at least three people were killed and 12 wounded in 
sundays raid that raised the overall toll of israeli air strikes 
this year to 19 dead and 51 injured excluding todays raid 
the raids followed word from irans official news agency 
saturday that one of the 16 western hostages in lebanon probably a 
european might soon be freed hezbollah is the umbrella group for 
factions believed holding most of the hostages 
let us pray the israeli attacks will not scuttle efforts to 
free one of the hostages said a shiite source close to 
hezbollahs iranianbacked leadership 
the hostageholders are definitely restless but i personally 
believe irans pressure will probably override the impact of the 
attacks the source said speaking on condition of anonymity 
shiite fundamentalists accuse western governments of bias toward 
israel and hold them responsible for its actions against the arabs 
jarjou and ein bouswar are two to three miles north of israels 
security zone hezbollah has long been engaged in guerrilla attacks 
on israeli troops and allied lebanese christian militiamen policing

boss was found guilty today of abuse of power and sentenced to four 
years in jail in the first conviction of a member of the countrys 
former hardline leadership 
the official miroslav stepan had ordered use of water cannon 
and tear gas against demonstrators in prague in the fall of 1988 a 
year later a popular uprising toppled the authoritarian communist 
government 
dozens of czechoslovak citizens crowded in front of the small 
room where the district court verdict was handed down and some 
expressed satisfaction 
that serves him right thats exactly what he deserved an 
elderly woman said 
under czechoslovak law sentencing comes at the time of 
conviction 
stepan appealed the verdict but was to remain in custody no 
date was set for the appeal which was to be heard by a municipal 
court

of his office when as chairman of the prague defense council he 
ordered the action against the demonstrators on oct 28 1988 
he was also accused of having demonstrators transported outside 
prague in january 1989 after they failed to disperse as ordered by 
police

doors but was opened to the public four days later after strong 
complaints in the czechoslovak media

five other former highranking officials including communist 
party leader milos jakes and chief ideologue vasil bilak were 
detained last month and accused of serious criminal activity 
but all were released within 48 hours

foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said today 
that western aid to the soviet union would benefit his country and 
the donor nations 
leaders of the worlds seven richest countries convened in 
houston today with the question of aid to moscow at the top of 
their agenda 
shevardnadze asked by reporters at a communist party congress 
in the kremlin whether he thought the soviet union needed western 
aid said i feel it would be advantageous for us and the west 
but he said he disliked the term aid preferring credit 
technical cooperation personnel training joint ventures and joint 
projects 
president mikhail s gorbachev is worried his country cannot 
make the painful leap to a market system without western credits 
and wants help from the industrial powers to stop the soviet 
unions economic decline 
gorbachev recently sent president bush a communique that is 
believed to repeat an appeal for aid he made in a letter to british 
prime minister margaret thatcher 
western opponents of aid to the soviet union say that no help 
should be given until the kremlin drops its economic and military 
support to cuba and withdraws from the kurile islands north of 
japan 
asked whether the soviet union would cut aid to cuba 
shevardnadze said that was strictly a question of bilateral 
relations and did not indicate the governments plans 
soviet troops occupied the japanese islands in the last days of 
world war ii and have refused to leave 
the leaders of west germany and france advocate helping the 
soviet union despite disagreements over cuba and japan and have 
called for aid worth 15 billion to bolster reform plans 
the credits also would help soviet businesses meet payments due 
to western firms the soviet union traditionally has been punctual 
in making such payments and recent delays have eroded confidence 
among foreign investors 
west germany already has granted an unconditional loan of 31 
billion and chancellor helmut kohl is apparently growing impatient 
with opposition from other industrial powers to the aid plan 
moscows balanceofpayment deficit now tops 2 billion nearly 
half of it owed to west german companies part of the west german 
credit is expected to be used to pay overdue bills 
bush has balked at a massive aid program until soviet 
authorities move more decisely from a planned to a market economy 
the soviet union could use western cash but there are questions 
over how much is needed and what impact it would have 
inability to keep food stores stocked has already forced moscow 
to spend an extra 3 billion roubles 500 million on food 
imports 
even more aid is believed necessary if the soviet union is going 
to leap to a market economy 
without an infusion of western cash the move to the market 
could cause greater hardship for the population and put more social 
pressure on gorbachev 
prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov told the supreme soviet 
parliament in late may that the consumer market was destitute 
ryzhkov presenting a plan for what he called a regulated 
market economy warned that if trends continued many crucial 
decisions unpopular as they are will meet an even more embittered 
response 
the soviet economy suffers from inflation and a huge budget 
deficit in the first four months of this year ethnic unrest and 
strikes caused the loss of an estimated 10 million manhours 
promarket reforms are likely to cause a further drop in 
production as unprofitable businesses go bankrupt 
figures on how much money would begin to stabilize the economy 
range from 5 to 20 billion colossal compared to what eastern 
european countries received to restructure their economies but 
modest given the size of the soviet economy and its relatively low 
level of foreign debt

a worldwide coalition of environmental groups is 
hoping to spotlight what it claims is a bigtalk littleaction 
record of the major industial nations meeting today at the economic 
summit 
the envirosummit group of 150 organizations says the worlds 
seven wealthiest countries have done little since ending their 1989 
meeting with a proclamation that decisive action is urgently 
needed to understand and protect the earths ecological balance 
president bush and his six summit guests have the global 
environment on their agenda tuesday and are expected to come up 
with a 1990 communique outlining how the seven nations will 
cooperate on international controls 
but us officials said in advance the summit was unlikely to 
produce any bold moves on environmental protection 
the envirosummit group ranks west germany highest on 
performance during the past year with a 65 score out of a possible 
100 
it tallied the score by examining policies on climate change 
protection of biological diversity preserving tropical forests 
combatting pollution of the oceans population control policy aid 
for the cleanup of eastern europe and aid to third world countries 
to preserve the environment during economic development 
france was second 48 out of 100 and the united states japan 
britain italy and canada were clustered close with scores ranging 
from 39 to 425 
white house chief of staff john sununu scoffed at the 
environmental survey results 
i think most of that grading was on environmental rhetoric 
rather than on environmental performance he said during an 
appearance today on abcs good morning america 
i think west germany got a lot of good grades for rhetoric 
sununu added if you take a good look at what the united states 
has actually done in terms of cleaning up our environment reducing 
emissions into the atmosphere cleaning up the quality of our water 
and now with the added benefit that will come from the clean air 
bill that the president put forward i dont think the united 
states has to take a back seat to anyone in terms of reality of 
performance on the environment 
although most countries agreed earlier this year to end 
production of chemicals that destroy the earths protective ozone 
layer by the year 2000 george t frampton president of the 
wilderness society said the reality is that our forests are 
being cut just as fast as they were a year ago carbon dioxide and 
other greenhouse gases are being emitted into the atmosphere at 
just the same high volume or even greater than that of a year 
ago population growth and ocean pollution have continued 
unabated 
jay hair executive vice president of the national wildlife 
federation told a news conference sunday that the most shining 
achievement of the past year was west germanys announcement that 
it would try to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide the most 
important greenhouse gas responsible for what many scientists 
believe is a gradual warming of the globe by 25 percent no other 
country has made such a commitment 
calling the scores generous by any standard conrad von 
moltke a german environmentalist on the staff of the world 
wildlife fund said its hard to see how germany is going to 
maintain this kind of ranking devoted as it is to everbigger 
cars everfaster cars on ever more roads 
this is not a oneshot deal frampton said members of the 
coalition will refine their scorecard to make it what frampton 
called a better objective template for measuring national 
policies and mobilize pressure against the governments concerned 
the group said one item of environmental news out of the summit 
had no effect on the national rankings that was the announcement 
by president bush and prime minister brian mulroney that canada and 
the united states would negotiate an air pollution agreement with 
preliminary talks this month 
bush said a year ago that he expected to proceed along those 
lines once revisions to the clean air act to enact new controls on 
the sources of acid rain were nailed down both the house and 
senate versions of the bill include requirements for large 
reductions in acid rain precursors and the white house is 
optimistic bush will get a bill from the housesenate conference 
committee that he can sign 
half the acid rain falling in eastern canada originates in 
sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from power plant 
smokestacks and other sources in the united states and mulroney 
and his predecessor pierre trudeau sought a us control program 
in vain for more than a decade 
i think this day will be long remembered in the history of our 
relationship for the significant departure it constitutes from past 
positions mulroney said in his joint appearance with bush

miners said today they were going ahead with a 
oneday protest strike this week despite an appeal for labor peace 
from soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and other communist 
leaders 
we no longer consider the communist party of the soviet union 
our party said vasily grinev a member of the strike committee 
in the countrys second largest coal field the kuznetsk basin in 
the western ukraine 
miners in the largest coal region the don river basin of the 
ukraine met for 12 hours sunday and resolved to go ahead with the 
strike on wednesday 
workers at the zhiguli automotive works in togliatti plan to 
hold a sympathy meeting during their lunch break but will not stop 
production said ivan a baryshnykov a workers spokesman 
the miners are angry over shortages of housing food and other 
consumer goods and concerned that gorbachevs reforms will raise 
prices without giving them any benefits 
the 28th congress of the soviet communist party last week urged 
miners not to strike gorbachev repeated that appeal in a televised 
interview sunday night warning workers not to take what he called 
an illegal path 
everybody should understand that this is not the time for 
ultimatums gorbachev said in a soviet television interview taped 
in the kremlin palace of congresses where the party congress is 
meeting 
after a nationwide coal strike last summer the government 
passed new rules requiring workers to complete a complicated 
procedure before they can legally strike but miners in vorkuta 
have been striking periodically over the past year 
despite the appeals feelings of anger and independence were 
growing among miners in the donbass western siberia and vorkuta in 
the arctic they plan to send only skeleton shifts into the shafts 
wednesday morning and stage demonstrations 
the protests are designed to warn party leaders that they can no 
longer assume the support of the working class they claim to 
represent 
asked whether the strike was a sign of flagging ties between the 
party and workers gorbachev acknowledged that the party is 
guilty before the working class because the workers role is 
weak now 
at a preliminary conference last month miners from around the 
nation scheduled a congress to found the union and called for a 
mass exodus of party workers and the nationalization of party 
assets 
although the party relinquished its constitutionally guaranteed 
monopoly of power last winter no nationwide political group has 
emerged to challenge it but a free nationwide miners union could 
do just that 
the party congress opened last monday with a demand from donbass 
miner vladimir bludov for the resignation of the communist party 
leadership 
the miners who work in shafts owned by the ministry of the coal 
mining industry struck last july to demand that the government 
increase supplies of meat soap laundry detergent and other 
consumer goods 
they also wanted safer working conditions in the mines where 
about 600 people are killed by accidents yearly and they wanted 
the ministry to surrender control of the coal fields to local 
authorities 
faced with the worst soviet strike in 72 years the council of 
ministers capitulated but the miners say the government has not 
kept its promises

police in eastern virginia believe the 
slayings of six young people and the disappearance of two others in 
recent years may be the work of a serial killer 
the unsolved cases involve four couples traveling by car in 
isolated areas one crime has occurred annually between april and 
october since 1986 none has occurred this year but police fear 
the killer may strike again by october 
police have been working jointly together for some years now 
and they have come to some possible conclusions said cpl bob 
haynes spokesman for a joint fbivirginia state police task force 
investigating the crimes with local police 
the killer may have dressed as an authority figure such as a 
police officer to win the victims cooperation and lure them to 
their deaths a newspaper reported sunday 
the virginianpilot and the ledgerstar the combined sunday 
paper quoted an unidentified source as saying the killer could be 
someone disguised as a police officer when asked whether the 
killer might be an officer the source said we cannot rule that 
out 
police plan to announce give detail on their findings at a news 
conference later this month haynes said 
theyre pretty much convinced its a serial killer said 
mark johnson a college of william and mary police detective 
johnson investigated the first crime the 1986 slayings one of the 
colleges students and her friend 
they felt it was all connected said margie lauer whose 
son daniel was one of the slaying victims mrs lauer said fbi 
and state police agents recently told her of the serial killer 
theory 
we were expecting something like this kathy knobling 
stepmother of another slaying victim said sunday she is a 
spokeswoman for a group of the victims relatives and friends 
irvin b wells iii special agent in charge of the fbis norfolk 
office said the randomness of the crimes and certain similarities 
lend credence to the serial killer theory 
but he also noted the crimes lack a definite signature 
because different types of weapons were used 
here are details of the four cases 
in october 1986 rebecca a dowski 21 a william and mary 
student from poughkeepsie ny and cathleen m thomas 27 a 
virginia beach stockbroker were found strangled and stabbed in 
miss thomass car along a scenic drive that connects historic sites 
at jamestown and yorktown 
in september 1987 robin m edwards 14 of newport news and 
david l knobling 20 of hampton were found shot to death on their 
first date at ragged island wildlife refuge in isle of wight county 
in april 1988 keith call 20 and cassandra hailey 19 two 
christopher newport college students disappeared on their first 
date calls pickup truck was found abandoned on the colonial 
parkway the two have not been found 
in september 1989 lauer 21 and annamaria phelps 18 both of 
amelia county disappeared on their way to virginia beach lauers 
car was found at a rest stop in new kent county their bodies were 
discovered in woods nearby six weeks later miss phelps died of a

czechoslovak diplomats said the first of 
the more than 5000 albanians who took refuge in a dozen foreign 
embassies in tirana would leave their communist homeland tonight 
for prague 
the announcement by the foreign ministry in prague followed 
accusations by albanian officials that foreign diplomats in the 
albanian capital were deliberately slowing the emigration process 
to cause instability 
in the czechoslovak capital deputy foreign minister vojtech 
wagner said 51 refugees would arrive in prague this evening from 
tirana aboard an aircraft normally used by president vaclav havel 
the state news agency ctk reported 
the czechoslovak diplomat said only one or two asylumseekers 
wanted to remain in czechoslovakia and the rest wanted to go to the 
united states or australia other missions said that although the 
albanians would travel through their countries they did not yet 
know where they would settle 
the french foreign ministry in paris said the formalities of 
obtaining passports for the 550 refugees at its embassy in tirana 
were moving along rapidly and we hope they will be finished by 
the end of the day 
the asylumseekers some dodging police bullets began taking 
refuge on june 28 albanian authorities pledged saturday that they 
would receive travel papers and be accompanied out by diplomatic 
personnel 
but referring to the decree that guaranteed the asylumseekers 
would not be punished the albanian state ata news agency on sunday 
accused diplomats of not moving quickly enough to seek documents 
for the refugees 
this is a stand with premeditation and certain aims to 
artificially create tensions and problems the statement said 
it also arouses embarrassment and indignation in the public 
opinion 
in bonn a foreign ministry spokesman said today that any of the 
3000 albanians crowding his countrys embassy in tirana who wish 
to travel to west germany will be allowed to do so 
but the official would not say whether the albanians would be 
allowed to settle in west germany he said that so far no one has

christian science officials contributed to the 
death of robyn twitchell by discouraging his parents from calling a 
doctor an inquest concluded three years ago 
david and ginger twitchell lifelong christian scientists were 
convicted wednesday of manslaughter in the april 1986 death of 
2yearold robyn by relying solely on prayer to treat the boy 
during a fiveday illness 
they were sentenced to 10 years probation on friday and ordered 
to take their three remaining children for regular medical exams 
in a 1987 report west roxbury district court judge lawrence d 
shubow found that the churchs chief spokesman nathan talbot a 
christian science nurse and a church practitioner contributed 
to robyns death by acting recklessly and without legal excuse 
the three were never indicted by the grand jury investigating 
the case 
shubows 35page report was impounded since its completion in 
1987 but was released friday by superior court judge sandra hamlin 
who presided at the twitchells manslaughter trial 
talbot was faulted for telling the twitchells to call a funeral 
home rather than the police or the medical examiner when the couple 
called talbot to say robyn had died talbot said today that the 
church no longer told followers to call a funeral home in such 
circumstances 
an autopsy showed the boy suffered from a congenital defect that 
had caused a bowel obstruction 
calling police or the medical examiner would have in normal 
course initiated a lifesaving response shubow wrote the 
delays in reporting robyns plight erased his remaining chance to 
survive 
linda blaisdell a church nurse recommended to the couple by 
talbot had earlier wrongfully prescribed food for robyn which 
probably worsened his illness shubow wrote 
nancy calkins a christian science practitioner apparently 
discouraged the parents from seeking to follow any alternative 
medically oriented choice shubow wrote 
talbot said this morning that the church had a longstanding 
policy of telling christian scientists to call a funeral home 
instead of calling police but that has changed since the twitchell 
case 
there has never been criticism of christian scientists 
handling it this way talbot said the policy has changed in part 
because funeral homes themselves now direct people to call 911 
talbot said 
calkins said today that she did not want to discuss the matter 
but her attorney peter samek disputed the report of the inquest 
thats false and i dont think that is the finding of the 
inquest samek said she has no ability to render anything 
besides christian science spiritual treatment 
blaisdell refused to comment on the report 
shubow concluded the twitchells should be prosecuted for 
manslaughter and that the church officials might be prosecuted as 
accessories to manslaughter 
suffolk district attorney newman a flanagan called for the 
inquest to determine the circumstances surrounding the boys death 
shubows findings were adopted by prosecutors and presented to a 
grand jury in 1988 but only the twitchells were indicted

thousands of nicaraguans armed with 
clubs and machetes built street barricades with paving stones early 
today in support of a weekold strike against the governments 
economic policies 
a warning was broadcast every halfhour on state radio 
nicaragua saying police would act harshly against those causing 
disorder but there were no signs of intervention by security 
forces 
some of managuas main streets were blocked bringing the 
capital to a virtual standstill 
in the lowincome eastern neighborhoods protesters passed 
paving stones from hand to hand to build barricades and burned huge 
bonfires of old tires a cloud of malodorous smoke hung low over 
managua at dawn 
associated press reporters touring trouble spots overnight were 
unable to return to their homes 
everyone must return to work today and those who do not will 
be fired president violetta barrios de chamorro warned in the 
radio broadcasts 
the scene was reminiscent of managua 11 years ago when the 
former sandinista government built similar barricades at the height 
of their revolution against former dictator gen anastasio somoza 
it was in the eastern neighborhoods that some of the most 
intense fighting took place during the 1979 revolution and where 
sandinista support is still the strongest the sandinistas remain 
the largest political grouping in nicaragua 
strike leaders say 80000 workers are taking part in the 
walkouts called in part to protest massive firings by the chamorro 
government workers also want a greater voice in setting economic 
policy 
unions threatened to interrupt electrical service and 
international flights if the government did not agree to their 
demands by today 
the strikes are directed against government offices public 
transportation telephone and mail services and staterun 
agriculture construction and textile businesses 
talks to end the walkouts collapsed friday and the government 
declared them illegal the government has said the strikes are 
politically motivated 
hope that ran high when mrs chamorro took office 10 weeks ago 
has faded as nicaraguans realized the econmomic crisis and bitter 
political divisions would not disappear quickly 
the government has said tough measures are needed to rescue the 
crumbling economy including cuts in government subsidies higher 
utility rates privatizing state enterprises and the return of land 
confiscated under the sandinistas 
a similar strike by nicaraguas topheavy public sector brought 
the country to a standstill in may strikers won major concessions 
including pay raises of 100 percent 
nicaraguas economy has been battered by almost a decade of war 
between the former sandinistas and the now disbanded usbacked 
contra rebels at least 50000 people died in that conflict 
mrs chamorro defeated sandinista leader daniel ortega in the 
feb 25 elections she is trying to reverse his partys centralized 
government policy and replace it with freemarket strategy

admirers of george mason say he gets no 
respect despite serving alongside thomas jefferson george 
washington and james madison as architects of the constitution 
unlike his fellow virginians mason never became president and 
no national monument was ever raised to his memory 
mason fans are working to redress what they say is a nearly 
200yearold wrong by erecting a memorial to him perhaps fittingly 
in the shadow of the jefferson memorial in washington dc 
it seems masons refusal to sign the constitution he helped 
create vexed his contemporaries enough that he was nearly written 
out of the history books 
george mason has been the forgotten patriot all along said 
donald r taylor director of gunston hall masons meticulously 
restored plantation on the potomac river near washingtons mount 
vernon home 
it seems that although mason played a very central role in 
creating what resulted in our federal form of government he has 
gotten bad press because he refused to sign the completed 
document taylor said 
masons main beef with the constitution it contained no bill of 
rights mason believed a rib of the new nations government must be 
protection for its citizens should that government turn hostile 
taylor said 
he also raised a few hackles in a losing battle to ban further 
imports of slaves he really was ahead of his time in many 
respects taylor said 
an antifederalist mason tangled frequently with madison and 
jefferson over the key issue of local control versus centralized 
power on most points mason lost in the end he was one of only 
three delegates to the 1787 constitutional convention who refused 
to sign 
mason died in 1792 one year after the bill of rights was added 
to the constitution the 10 amendments closely resemble a bill of 
rights for virginia that mason drafted in 1776 
taylor would like to install the modest sculpture honoring mason 
next year the bicentennial of the bill of rights 
the site selected by taylors group is a somewhat remote plot 
near the tidal basin a bed of flowers and small stone fountain now 
occupy it 
state sen joseph v gartlan jr prodded the legislature to 
contribute 100000 to build the memorial another 150000 is 
being raised by the gunston hall board of regents 
a virginia sculptors blueprints call for a pair of 15foot 
bronze pyramids mounted inside the fountain quotes from mason and 
a carving of him would surround the pool 
it is lowkey but very symbolic taylor said one pyramid 
would have 16 striations representing the 16 articles of the 
virginia declaration of rights the other would have 10 for the 10 
amendments in the bill of rights he said 
a previous effort to honor mason did little to rescue him from 
obscurity in the 1950s a span of the 14th street bridge over the 
potomac was renamed for mason 
an unofficial survey of virginia commuters who use the bridge 
daily shows the nomenclature is almost universally ignored 
its named for who asked one woman 
taylor has heard this before there are plenty of people in 
virginia and elsewhere who have never heard of him taylor said 
thats despite the growing presence of george mason university a 
state university in fairfax county 
the memorial project has cleared most official hurdles although 
congress still must approve the plan sen charles s robb dva 
is leading that effort which has attracted no opposition 
if congress misses next years date the installation could be 
keyed to the 200th anniversary of masons death in 1992 taylor 
said

antigovernment violence fueled by an 
aborted prodemocracy rally spread across the nation today and 
police used gunfire and tear gas in clashes with protesters two 
people were reported killed 
the death brought to at least five the number of people reported 
killed since the disturbances began saturday when police used 
gunfire and tear gas to stop thousands from rallying 
protesters tried to rally after the government detained at least 
12 prodemocracy activists last week the us embassy confirmed 
today that it had given asylum to one activist who went into hiding 
the government made its first comment on the rioting in a 
statement that condemned the united states decision to give refuge 
to kuria and us suggestions that kenya consider political 
pluralism 
the government of kenya wishes to protest in the strongest 
terms against this unwarranted interference in kenyas 
international affaris by the embassy of a friendly country the 
statement said 
the choice of what kind of political system kenyans want 
cannot be forced upon the people of this country by anybody and 
neither can it be brought by the kind of violence hooliganism and 
lawlessness which was witnessed in certain parts of nairobi last 
weekend it said 
a spokesman said the us embassy had no immediate comment on 
the protest 
today marked the first time the violence spread outside nairobi 
clashes between demonstrators and police were reported in nakuru 
muranga and nyeri all north of the capital 
in ndenderu about 10 miles north of nairobi police opened fire 
on demonstrators and shot dead an elementary school student 
according to a daily nation newspaper photographer who witnessed 
the incident 
the other death occurred in one of more than half a dozen 
lowincome neighborhoods ringing the capital where stonethrowing 
mobs clashed with police police confirmed the death but would not 
give details 
riot police used clubs and gunfire to break up gangs and clear 
openair markets where rioters burned a bus and used boulders and 
burning tires to build roadblocks 
security forces and bands of demonstrators also clashed on 
sunday 
president daniel arap moi left today for ethiopia to attend the 
annual organization of african unity summit 
 
he repeatedly has rejected any move toward a multiparty system 
saying the existence of about 40 tribes in kenya would invite 
tribalbased parties leading to ethnic divisions and even tribal 
warfare 
the government has reacted angrily to us suggestions that it 
consider allowing competing political parties at one point the 
government threatened to curtail the movements of the us 
ambassador smith hempstone 
hempstone was the target of a bitter attack on sunday in the 
kenya times the ruling partys newspaper in an editorial titled 
shut up mr ambassador it threatened his expulsion 
hempstone called the editorial an outrageous piece of work 
nairobi was tense today shops closed and businesses shut down 
as people fled the city to escape further violence thousands left 
on foot because public transportation appeared to have stopped 
the englishlanguage daily nation newspaper said three people 
were killed in sundays disturbances 
ten people five with gunshot wounds were hospitalized in 
serious condition and dozens of others had been wounded since the 
violence began saturday the newspaper said 
hospitals provided no official casualty figures

however the gunfire did not appear directed at the american 
mission which has given temporary asylum to gibson kamau kuria a 
prominent human rights lawyer under threat of arrest for his 
criticism of kenyas oneparty rule 
kuria a former detainee who in 1988 won the robert f kennedy 
human rights award sought refuge at the us embassy in nairobi 
early saturday according to a statement released by the embassy 
today 
he came on his own and asked for temporary refuge the 
statement said he expressed a desire to leave the country we 
are discussing this matter with the government of kenya 
kuria 43 went into hiding thursday following a wave of arrests 
in which kenyas most prominent proponents of multiparty democracy 
were seized 
the united states is a major donor to kenya whose economy is 
heavily dependent on foreign aid last year the us gave 61 
million in economic aid and 15 million in military assistance 
according to a study prepared by the heritage foundation a

an inquiry will be held into the conduct of a 
steamship captain who was criticized for not coming to the aid of 
the titanic when it sank 78 years ago the government said monday 
the titanic sank after striking an iceberg in the north atlantic 
on april 14 1912 more than 1500 of the 2200 people aboard the 
ship perished 
the marine accident investigation branch will examine testimony 
at the 1912 inquiry into the loss of the great liner to throw light 
on the role of the late capt stanley lord said a department of 
transport spokeswoman 
the inquiry comes in response to a campaign by lords relatives 
who have been trying to clear his name said the spokeswoman she 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the inquiry was first reported in mondays editions of the daily 
telegraph which said a crucial piece of evidence would be the 
position of the wreck as determined in 1985 by us oceanographer 
robert ballard 
lord was master of the bostonbound californian believed to 
have been the ship nearest to the titanic when it struck the 
iceberg 
the carpathia and other ships which were farther away than the 
californian did reach the scene in answer to the stricken liners 
distress calls 
lords ship was stopped by ice at the time the original inquiry 
censured him for not responding to distress rockets from the 
titanic and ruled that as he was 8 to 10 miles from the liner he 
could have gone to its aid and saved lives 
lord died in 1962 claiming to the end that the titanic was in 
an icefield 20 miles or more from his ship and that he was unable 
to help a campaign to clear his name has been carried on by his 
son and other supporters and an earlier petition to reopen the 
inquiry was rejected in 1965 
lord insisted that a ship seen from the californian was not the 
titanic the ship was only identified in 1962 as the samson a 
sealhunter 
supporters of capt lord claimed he was a scapegoat for the 
failire of the titanics owners and the board of trade to make sure 
there were enough lifeboats the daily telegraph said 
it quoted capt james de coverley deputy chief of marine 
accidents as saying the 1912 inquiry would not be reopened as that 
had been into the titanics loss not lords conduct 
we are not in the business of rewriting history but in this 
particular case it was considered desirable to have a 
reevaluation de coverley was quoted as saying

scattered rain and cooler temperatures 
helped slow the spread of wildfires that have charred more than 
550000 acres of timber but 2100 firefighters remained on the job 
no lives or homes have been lost to the more than 200 fires 
across the state most sparked by lightning strikes there have 
been no reports of arson authorities said 
firefighters from all over the united states were attacking the 
43 worst fires aided by 34 helicopters and 11 air tankers dropping 
fire retardant 
the cooling trend allowed firefighters to get close enough to 
flames to begin taking the offensive said bureau of land 
management spokesman rob mcwhorter 
by early today more than 550000 acres of forest and tundra had 
been consumed by wildfires an increase of more than 200000 acres 
from saturday when 23 new fires were started after 2600 recorded 
lightning strikes officials said 
theres so many fires and alaskas so big theres still a day 
and a half to twoday lag in mapping fires and coming up with 
acreages said frank carroll with the fire information center in 
fairbanks alaska makes texas look like a very small place 
the tok fire remained a top priority because it still was 
considered a potential threat to people and buildings if winds 
changed and hot summer temperatures returned 
the tok airport reopened to civilian air traffic sunday as the 
fire that swept near the town moved toward the village of tetlin 
20 miles away mcwhorter said 
the village of 60 residents wasnt immediately threatened by the 
blaze but firefighters were monitoring winds to see which way 
flames would blow he said 
crews using bulldozers nearly finished digging a fire line 
around tok a southeastern alaska town of 1200 residents located 
at the junction of the alaska and glenn highways that have been 
closed off and on since last week 
thirty smokejumpers on sunday parachuted near a fire threatening 
cabins on the yukon river about 15 miles from the crossing of the 
transalaska pipeline 
cabins were threatened by the 3000acre cassiar creek fire 
about 50 miles from fairbanks the beaver fire named after a 
village within 10 miles of the flames was estimated to have 
charred almost 200000 acres by today carroll said

many of the temporary workers taking the 
nations census may be ineligible for unemployment compensation 
when their jobs end because of a recent moneysaving change in the 
law 
the actual number of people affected is hard to estimate because 
rules for unemployment compensation eligibility vary from state to 
state neither congressional or census spokesmen would estimate the 
number affected 
in the past temporary census jobs have counted toward 
eligibility for unemployment compensation just as any other job 
however this year an appropriations bill signed by president 
bush on may 25 set an april 20 cutoff on census workers getting 
credit toward unemployment temporary census work done after that 
date doesnt count when they are eventually laid off and apply for 
unemployment benefits 
how that cutoff affects individual workers depends on the 
unemployment eligibility rules in their states some states for 
example require 26 weeks of work before someone becomes eligible 
people who havent accumulated that before april 20 would not be 
able to collect benefits 
april 20 was the deadline for people sending in their mailed 
census forms meaning the credit cutoff applies primarily to the 
thousands of temporary field workers who were sent doortodoor to 
track down people who did not apply much of that work has now been 
finished although followup operations are expected to continue at 
least through fall in some areas 
warren kane of the senate appropriations committee which 
inserted the provision into a financial bill said the action made 
70 million available for completing the national head count 
the low response rate to the mailed portion of the census meant 
more staff had to be hired to go door to door and the committee 
had to find money to cover that hiring 
in looking at census finances he said the committee found that 
when the bureau hired temporary workers it was setting money aside 
to cover their later unemployment costs when the jobs ended by 
cutting off unemployment credit at april 20 the committee 
eliminated the need for those funds which then became available 
for hiring more temporary workers kane said

president mikhail s gorbachev won a critical 
behindthescenes struggle today for a new communist party 
politburo that is expected to champion his reforms and push for a 
looser federation of the soviet republics 
the party congress voted to require the politburo to consist of 
the general secretary his deputy and the first secretaries of the 
parties of the 15 republics 
the change guarantees that the small group of primarily russian 
men who traditionally ruled the soviet union would be replaced by 
largely proreform nonrussian communists 
most of the republic party leaders want the political 
sovereignty market economy and looser union of states advocated by 
gorbachev 
the change also allows gorbachev to bypass the 250member 
central committee expected to be heavily conservative when the 
congress elects it later this week 
the congress is expected to elect gorbachev to continue as 
general secretary despite vitriolic criticism of his political and 
economic reforms from delegates at the largely conservative party 
congress 
some delegates said he may be allowed to virtually handpick his 
deputy although the congress officially elects the person when it 
meets once in five years 
a wearylooking gorbachev took the floor of the 28th party 
congress this afternoon after hammering his proposal through four 
hours of heated discussions in committee 
after making his announcement gorbachev sat down next to the 
temporary chairman of the party congress parliamentary chairman 
anatoly lukyanov and urged quietly lets vote 
the key vote on changing the politburo membership to include the 
republic leaders was 3325 to 839 
gorbachev told delegates that others could be added to the 
politburo by the central committee from among its members but the 
final rules did not mention this 
the new rule could completely change the politburo membership 
because none of the 15 republic party chiefs are now members of the 
12man body 
seven of the 12 men on the current politburo already have said 
they will resign or have hinted of the possibility 
any decentralization and particularly the looser union of 
sovereign republics now under discussion would give the republics 
more power over their own affairs 
most republic leaders also believe their areas will fare far 
better under a market economy than under continued central 
planning which they blame for sucking dry their republics 
resources and giving little in return 
gorbachev said the new structure would allow the 15 republic 
parties to act independently and to really influence the central 
committee and politburo 
the current 12man politburo has only two nonrussian members 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze from the republic of georgia 
and ukrainian president vladimir ivashko there is but one 
nonrussian latvian boris pugo among the seven nonvoting members 
of the politburo 
the congress was expected to take nominations for general 
secretary later in the day 
on sunday gorbachev who has been the party general secretary 
since 1985 faced tough questioning at a meeting of workers and 
farmers attending the congress as nonvoting observers 
many soviets blame the communists for the economic crisis and 
decades of institutional corruption and the partys candidates 
have suffered defeat after defeat at the polls 
coal miners announced plans to stage a oneday nationwide strike 
wednesday to warn party leaders they can no longer take for granted 
the support of the working class they claim to represent 
the meeting of workers farmers and gorbachev was closed to 
foreign reporters and soviet media carried no details 
many of gorbachevs remarks were conveyed by nina zhukova a 
weaver from the russian city of ivanovo she said she sat near 
gorbachev at the meeting her account was confirmed by other 
participants interviewed on red square 
sergei sotnikov a party official from yaroslavl said the 
atmosphere was tense and included complaints about the lack of 
consumer goods in stores 
they criticize me personally or the politburo and debate 
whether to remove us or not gorbachev reportedly said during 
the fourhour session 
i will listen to it all but you will decide everything am i 
needed by you you will decide he said 
gorbachev sometimes reacts angrily to criticism and at least 
four times in the past two years he has offered to resign 
he told the workers and farmers that the matter was in the hands 
of the congress 
i maintain only one thing the policy that i have chosen i 
will pursue and for me the biggest prize is that my homeland will 
live he said according to zhukova she said gorbachev urged the 
audience to support him

a key witness against marion barry 
acknowledged today that she used drugs just a month ago and said 
she has distributed them 300 times to about 10 people in addition 
to the mayor 
the fbi hasnt asked for the names of her other customers lydia 
pearson told the jury in barrys cocaine and perjury trial 
the only one of her alleged customers the fbi asked her 
about was marion barry asked the mayors lawyer r kenneth 
mundy 
yes replied pearson 
she said the other customers to whom she has sold drugs numbered 
about 10 
how many times did she distribute drugs mundy asked her 
300 times 400 times 
i will say three hundred she replied 
pearson said she last used drugs june 8 she also used drugs in 
february days before appearing before a federal grand jury to 
testify in the barry case 
she acknowledged that she has been granted limited immunity from 
prosecution none of her statements in the barry case can be used 
against her 
she testified she supplied him with crack about 25 times in a 
threemonth span three bags of crack at 30 a bag was his usual 
purchase she added 
she described crack deliveries to barry at two hotels and a 
government office building and provided approximate dates for the 
alleged deliveries 
mundy had exploited the inability of former model rasheeda 
moore an earlier witness to recall dates of her alleged drug use 
with barry over several years 
convicted cocaine dealer charles lewis had testified that he and 
the mayor used cocaine repeatedly at the ramada inn in december 
1988 they conspired to cover up their drug use from investigators 
by agreeing to testify falsely to a grand jury lewis said 
moore testified that she and barry used cocaine marijuana and 
opium over 100 times from 1986 to 1989 
she persuaded barry to come to her hotel room in the jan 18 fbi 
sting where the mayor was videotaped smoking crack 
barrys lawyers say the mayor was the victim of entrapment and 
that his accusers are lying to avoid prison lewis was released 
from jail shortly before his testimony 
barry his lawyers suggest is merely another in a long series 
of black leaders targeted by the fbi 
barry the citys mayor for nearly 12 years pleaded innocent to 
10 counts of cocaine possession one count of conspiracy and three 
felony charges of lying to a federal grand jury

gov buddy roemer said today he was cool 
to way the legislatures hastily passed antiabortion bill was 
drafted but also called it a step in the correct direction 
after failing to override the governors veto of a stronger 
antiabortion bill the legislature passed a measure sunday that 
would ban most abortions and punish doctors who perform them with 
up to 10 years at hard labor 
the law includes provisions demanded by roemer to exempt victims 
of rape and incest but he said today he wouldnt take action on it 
until he had read all the fine print 
the bill approved sunday night bans all abortions except those 
to end pregnancies that endanger a womans life and those caused by 
rape or incest that is reported promptly despite being weaker than 
the bill roemer vetoed last week it still would be the strictest 
state abortion law in the nation 
at a news conference today roemer said he was pleased that 
there was some movement in the correct direction but also was 
disappointed that it was a lastminute move 
not well done that was my feeling he said 
roemer gave no timetable for acting he has 20 days to take 
action 
well have to read it first roemer said it happened late 
last night we have an obligation constitutionally to look at 
the bill and see if it does what they say it does 
if he signs it or does nothing it goes into effect 60 days 
after the end of the legislative session which is today if he 
vetoes it the only way the legislature could revive it would be by 
calling itself into special session and staging yet another 
override vote 
on sunday sen john saunders mastermind of the revised 
legislation urged fellow legislators to vote for the 15000 
unborn children who are murdered in this state every year for the 
200000 murdered in the nation the nation is watching us 
the measure is intended to challenge roe vs wade the 1973 us 
supreme court decision recognizing the right to an abortion 
roemer had vetoed the legislatures original bill friday because 
it made no exceptions for victims of rape or incest 
the bill was created by amending a flagburning measure the 
senate had refused to consider then eliminating the flagburning 
provisions which would have reduced the penalty for beating up a 
flag burner to a 25 fine the offense currently is punishable by 
six months in jail and a 500 fine 
the maneuver completed 30 hours before the legislative session 
ends at midnight tonight enabled the senate to circumvent the 
usual process of referring new legislation to a committee 
i would have preferred a stronger bill but we dont have the 
votes for an override saunders told his colleagues 
the senate vote on the bill was 327 less than an hour later 
the house approved the measure 8322 
the house had voted late last week to override the governors 
veto of the earlier bill the senate on saturday voted 2316 to 
override three votes short of the needed twothirds majority 
both abortionrights activists and staunch abortion foes 
criticized the new bill 
weve just seen the legislature go from the most restrictive 
abortion bill in the nation to the most absurd said planned 
parenthood spokeswoman terri bartlett the only thing that 
surpasses it is the mockery of the legislative process only in 
louisiana could you have a flagburning bill become an abortion 
bill 
rep woody jenkins the original bills author voted against 
the new version because the unborn is a human being from the 
moment of conception and we ought not make exceptions to the 
principle 
the bill carries a penalty of one to 10 years in prison and 
10000 to 100000 in fines for doctors who perform abortions it 
would not penalize women who get abortions 
the hard labor provision of the sentence means that the 
inmate if medically able would be required to perform physical 
work rather than clerical or cleanup duties louisianas state 
penitentiary is a farm operation that requires field work 
in the house rep cr jones urged colleagues to reject the 
bill pleading with them to resist the intense lobbying by 
fundamentalist christian groups and roman catholics 
im concerned that religious groups have taken over in 
louisiana the south maybe this nation jones said 
pennsylvania has the strictest state abortion law but it is 
less restrictive than the louisiana bill 
the pennslyvania measure approved in november bans abortions 
based on the fetus sex and bans abortions after the 24th week of 
pregnancy except to save the life of the mother or prevent 
substantial and irreversible harm 
a doctor convicted under the sexselection ban or the 24week 
provision could be punished with up to seven years in prison and a 
15000 fine 
portions of the law have been put on hold by a state appeals 
court 
an even stricter abortion bill was passed in the us territory 
of guam but it has been blocked for now by court challenges 
that law prohibits any abortion except to save the life of the 
pregnant woman and makes it a felony to perform an abortion and a 
misdemeanor to have one

when former schoolteacher kenneth kaunda 
led the british colony of northern rhodesia to independence as 
zambia 26 years ago he was the head of one of africas richest and 
most stable nations 
world prices for copper which accounts for 90 percent of 
zambias export income were riding high kaunda warmed in the 
glow of popular support and was hailed as the father of zambia the 
colonial rulers left him with 400 million in credit 
today zambia is one of the worlds poorest nations it has a 7 
billion foreign debt and most of the countrys 75 million 
inhabitants want the 66yearold president to step down 
kaunda out tembo in was the cry in lusaka the capital 
and other parts of the country during last months riots six days 
of zambias bloodiest urban violence since independence in 1964 
the imprisoned ltgen christon tembo 46 kaundas former army 
commander has been hailed as zambias man of the hour 
summoned home from his job as ambassador to west germany in 
october 1988 tembo was arrested with three other officers for 
allegedly plotting a coup he has been jailed ever since 
his trial began last year and he has pleaded innocent to a 
capital charge of treason 
the rioting and looting june 2530 was fueled by stateordered 
increases of 120 percent in the price of cornmeal the nations 
staple food known locally as mealie meal 
at least 26 civilians were killed by police and army bullets 
hundreds were wounded and more than 1500 were arrested mainly for 
violating a dusktodawn curfew 
some victims were gunned down june 30 as they rejoiced near 
kaundas official residence over a state radio broadcast that the 
army had seized power in an overnight rebellion 
the announcer was signals corps lt mwamba luchembe 38 son of 
a bemba tribal chief he and three fellow officers plotted to 
overthrow kaunda while the president was visiting the central 
province of ndola 
luchembe and his comrades were arrested by loyalist troops at 
the radio zambia building they face a treason trial and possible 
death if convicted 
in the last urban unrest in december 1986 also over food price 
increases 15 people were killed by security forces but anger then 
was directed at the army not kaunda 
this time in a dozen cities and towns protesters demanded 
kaundas resignation a return to old prices and a restoration of 
multiparty democracy which was abolished with the imposition of a 
oneparty state in 1972 
kaunda was defiant 
all they can do is kill me he said after he learned of the 
failed coup attempt i will not bow to thuggery 
still police guard was reinforced at state house the curfew 
was extended and kaunda cut down public appearances 
weve had enough said lucas a youth from lusakas chilenje 
township who clutched rocks in both hands at the height of the 
antigovernment riots its time for him to go 
like most zambians interviewed lucas spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
dorothy mubanga a primary school teacher is a typical zambian 
who suffered from the government decision to lift subsidies on 
cornmeal and more than double its price 
the move was part of a package of economic austerity proposals 
made by the international monetary fund the world bank and western 
nations zambias main creditors at least twofifths of export 
income is sapped by debt repayments 
mubanga earns about 3250 a month from which she has to buy at 
least two bags of mealie meal which now costs 1345 
on top of other food purchases such as sugar meat tea bread 
and vegetables she must pay rent for her small suburban house and 
bus fares to work and back leaving her without a cent to spare 
her two brothers like most unemployed zambians try to make 
ends meet by selling smuggled goods from botswana and south africa 
on lusakas black market 
even welloff zambians expressed sympathy for the rioters and 
dismay with the president 
however kaunda has refused to make any significant concessions 
instead he promised to crack down on coup plotters and 
thugs some 5000 students from the university of zambia who 
led the week of violence have been sent home 
but kaunda did seize on the troubles to announce a national 
referendum on whether to revive political pluralism 
the ruling united national independence party grudgingly agreed 
to put the issue to a vote in march but only after kaunda declared 
he feared democracy would plunge the country into tribal conflicts 
if the referendum is free and fair zambians are expected to 
snub their head of state and opt for the multiparty system used by 
the british colonists prior to independence observers say

april by the national interprofessional office of wine which 
represents various associations of winemakers and sellers

12400 people the organization said no margin of error was given 
in a 1980 survey conducted by the group 387 percent of the 
respondents said they never drink wine that percentage climbed to 
451 in 1985 and to 507 this year

a year ago the idea would have been unthinkable 
now it is the most compelling question to confront these leaders of 
the western world should they dig into their deep pockets to help 
the soviet union and mikhail s gorbachev 
the risk of saying no could be the failure of perestroika the 
ambitious restructuring of the soviet system and gorbachevs 
downfall but saying yes has its perils too since it would mean 
pouring billions into an economic morass that has resisted five 
years of gorbachev reforms 
but where would we be if he were chucked out brian 
mulroney the canadian prime minister wondered aloud on sunday as 
he and leaders of the six other richest nations gathered for their 
annual economic summit still mulroney himself isnt ready to 
provide direct help just now 
even more skeptical is president bush who received gorbachevs 
plea for help in his role as summit host the president questions 
the wisdom of assisting the kremlin while it provides 5 billion a 
year to marxist cuba spends about onequarter of its budget on the 
military and has put few freemarket procedures into play 
at a very minimum the seven leaders are expected to send a team 
of experts to the soviet union to assess its economic problems if 
the summit produces nothing more for gorbachev than that it would 
hardly amount to a ringing endorsement 
gorbachev knows he has problems they are everywhere and he 
wants help 
as the summit opened today the issue was completely up in the 
air there was no decisive majority for or against helping 
gorbachev to overcome an ossified economic system that makes the 
soviet union an unpopular trade partner and faint source of relief 
to deprived and depressed consumers 
west german chancellor helmut kohl with a strong assist from 
french president francois mitterrand wants to put together a 15 
billion aid package for gorbachev they are the strongest advocates 
of direct assistance 
bush has big problems with the concept he said at the nato 
summit meeting last week in london so does prime minister toshiki 
kaifu of japan he reiterated last friday it would not be 
possible for japan to participate in economic assistance to 
moscow until the soviets resolved a 45year territorial dispute 
over four islands in the kuril peninsula 
the split is fundamental according to a wellplaced us 
official it is so deep the seven governments have not even decided 
whether to deal with aid to moscow in their summitending 
declarations later his week 
decisions on virtually all the other items on the summit agenda 
await only the leaders pro forma approval they have been worked 
over by experts since the last summit in paris but aiding the 
soviet union is the vexing exception 
it isnt the first time in the 16 years of economic summits that 
a solution to a tough issue had to be hammered out in hard 
bargaining at the summit itself 
in 1983 the last time the united states played host president 
reagan held out at williamsburg va for a declaration demanding 
the soviets negotiate the withdrawal of their intermediaterange 
nuclear missiles from asia as well as europe 
japan of course backed reagan and the president prevailed 
four years later he signed a treaty with gorbachev for the 
destruction of all us and soviet mediumrange missiles in asia 
as well as in europe 
at the tokyo summit in 1987 a strong declaration against 
terrorism emerged from heated debate among the leaders the 
decision was not precooked by the aides known popularly as 
sherpas it was taken by the leaders themselves 
and last year tough bargaining at the table in paris produced 
the decision to set up a group of 24 nations to channel assistance 
to poland and hungary which were shaking free from the soviet 
orbit 
only last week in paris the 24 countries decided to expand 
their program to czechoslovakia bulgaria and yugoslavia 
at this point said the us official who discussed the issue on 
condition he not be identified the three most likely ways of 
resolving the soviet aid problem at the summit are these 
declaring each of the seven nations can decide for itself 
whether to help gorbachev that would mean bush and kaifu would not 
stand in the way of kohl and mitterrand while maybe helping the 
soviets in less dramatic ways such as with technical advice 
appointing a panel to study the issue that would give the 
leaders possibly a year to make their minds up while monitoring how 
gorbachev proceeds with his experimentation with capitalistic ways 
setting out conditions in the declaration for direct aid to 
moscow they could include requirements for less military spending 
and a reduction or cutoff of aid to cuba 
only a few months ago when rep richard gephardt dmo 
proposed a package of direct us aid to rescue gorbachev the 
congressman was ridiculed by administration officials and some of 
bushs strongest supporters such as sen alan simpson rwyo 
but now it is a real possibility causing bush to think hard 
about the consequences if the soviet leader falls 
canadas mulroney stressed that theme saying if he were 
chucked out by some of the extreme right influences we see at play 
in the soviet party conference that is ongoing in moscow today i 
think we would be at an infinitely worse position than we are 
today 
and yet mulroney called soviet aid to cuba profoundly 
unacceptable and an obstacle to western aid 
he said canada was willing at this point to provide trade 
credits not direct assistance 
meanwhile douglas hurd the british foreign secretary left no 
doubt where the margaret thatchers government stands 
the summits message to moscow he said should be mend the 
hole in the pants before you fill the pockets with dimes and 
cents 
but no one doubts that a lot more than small change is at stake

authorities cant find rhyme or reason to 
the theft of a statue commemorating the little lamb that followed 
19thcentury resident mary sawyer to school one day 
the heist has vexed some residents who believe theyve been 
robbed of a piece of history 
i cant understand anybody taking it said karen gaylord a 
20year resident and parttime spokeswoman for the sterling police 
department it has great historical value to the town but its 
not something that you could sell 
the concrete statute of the lamb hads stood on the town common 
since the early 1960s and was a fixture of this central 
massachusetts town of 6000 said ruth hopfmann of the sterling 
historical society 
innumerable people have stopped and gotten out of the car with 
their children to see what the little animal was it really has 
attracted a lot of attention over the past 30 years she said 
police theorize vandals removed the statue by rocking it back 
and forth the legs already were crumbling at the base gaylord 
said the statue was taken during the night of july 1 and a search 
has revealed no clues she said 
weve been in dumpsters and behind buildings weve been 
everywhere she said 
the society already was planning a new statue and has raised 
about 7000 toward that but mrs hopfmann said residents had 
hoped to install the original version among the societys 
collection of artifacts 
the statue was donated in 1962 by summer resident alfred altman 
who was president of the national dairymens association in new 
york 
the legend dates to about 1816 when mary elizabeth sawyers 
little lamb followed her to school mrs hopfmann said the child 
hid the lamb under her desk but when she went to the front of the

fiftyfive farm advocates and a pair of 
wellbehaved longhorn steers paraded next to rice university 
monday but the protests tractors like so many in summitsnarled 
houston got stuck in traffic 
the group of farmers and environmentalists said they had a beef 
with president bushs efforts toward an agriculture trade 
agreement one issue on the table at the sevennation economic 
summit 
motorcades and streetclosings made a mess of usually congested 
houston arteries monday morning and a halfmile stroll down fannin 
street by redbone and tumbleweed two 1400pound farm advocates 
from barker texas only made the going slower 
a dozen tractors from outlying farm communities never made it 
inside houstons freeway loop organizer craig merrilees said 
the demonstrators claimed bushs plan for agriculture under a 
general agreement on tariffs and trade would undercut prices for 
american farmers and allow imports of cheaper foods grown with 
pesticides not allowed in the united states 
it is the final nail in the coffin of the family farmer and 
it may be the final nail in all our coffins said lana nelson 
daughter of country singer willie nelson 
bush has been pushing for a plan to phaseout farm subsidies 
over the next 10 years europeans have been resisting the idea 
which doesnt sit well with smallscale american farmers either 
carl king corn cobs pictured on his tie said farmers would 
accept a gatt agreement if its fair 
if we open everything up there will be no fairness involved 
because youre going to be competing with farms that have peon 
labor overseas and that dont have to deal with regulations from 
osha or epa king said 
we just want to see the farmers get their price from the 
marketplace said don vig a valley city nd farmer with the 
national family farm coalition but we object to the way bush 
wants to do it 
the steers sporting gold finials on their horns were the 
centerpiece of the ragtag halfmile march down one lane of 
traffic houston parks officials wouldnt allow the hungry animals 
on the grass of hermann park so they kept to the street 
a few german and japanese farmers joined the march with gatt 
you tear down all the barriers that protect a peoples own culture 
and the farmers are the first to be hit said pieter bricke a 
bonn economist who marched with his wife johanna a farmer

a northeast arkansas school district is 
taking a forecasters prediction to heart and has tentatively 
planned an early december earthquake break 
the south mississippi county school district no 57 wont hold 
classes on dec 34 if the school board approves in deference to 
climatologist iben brownings prediction of a major earthquake 
along the new madrid fault during that time 
browning claims to have accurately predicted last falls 
northern california earthquake within one day he also says he 
correctly predicted the 1971 earthquake in californias san 
fernando valley a deadly earthquake in nicaragua in 1972 and 
eruption of the mount st helens volcano in 1980 
south mississippi county superintendent harvey barton said he is 
taking browning seriously browning has predicted a quake for dec 
2 or 3 a sunday and monday the district north of memphis tenn 
has canceled classes on dec 3 and 4 it will use that time for 
staff development days mandated by the state department of 
education barton said 
because we are a large rural area covering approximately 400 
square miles transporting students would be a hardship if we 
should have an earthquake barton said 
the new madrid seismic zone stretches roughly from northeast 
arkansas northward to southern illinois 
communities that make up the south mississippi county school 
district are within 30 miles of marked tree the center of a series 
of great earthquakes measuring as high as 85 on the richter scale

president bush welcomed leaders of the worlds 
major industrial democracies to the economic summit monday with a 
charge to work for new stability and prosperity in a world 
where all that seems possible is possible 
bush conferred privately with french president francois 
mitterrand and then with west german chancellor helmut kohl before 
the midafternoon formal opening of the summit 
in remarks prepared the afternoon ceremony bush said these 
economic summits have become a framework for frank constructive 
dialogue a dialogue for progress that i believe will be advanced 
greatly in these next three days 
together we are called upon as allies and as friends to work 
toward decisions here in houston that will bring new stability and 
prosperity to the world by tapping the power and energy of free 
wills and free markets bush said 
he said a new world of freedom lies before us hopeful 
confident a world where peace endures where commerce has 
conscience where all that seems possible is possible so let us 
begin in good faith to set the stage for the new millennium 
bush met first with mitterrand giving kohl a little more time 
to rest up from his overnight flight from rome where he watched 
the west german 10 triumph over argentina in sundays world cup 
final 
bush later greeted kohl with a jaunty thumbsup saying 
welcommen hail the champions of football 
world champions its a big win for germany said bush who 
later boasted that bush had played soccer himself on a championship 
team at yale in the 1940s 
mitterrand flew the speedier concorde to houston this morning 
then flew by helicopter to the bayou club a polo field near bushs 
houstonian hotel after a short motorcade bush was waiting to 
greet mitterrand at the houstonians manor house but both leaders 
declined to answer reporters questions about whether the western 
allies can forge a common position on bailing out the soviets 
stumbling economy 
as they sat across a table in a cool greenshaded sun room at 
the back of manor house bush waved off questions directed at 
mitterrand saying this is a photo opportunity president 
mitterrand does not take questions at photo opportunities and im 
defending his right not to take questions 
nice try bush told reporters who directed their inquiry at 
his guest 
then as the media was ushered out of the room bush extended 
his arms and said well welcome to the travelers im very 
pleased youre here 
the soviet aid issue loomed as the largest facing the 16th 
annual gathering of the worlds richest nations with bush on one 
side kohl and mitterrand on the other 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has appealed to bush as 
summit host for economic help but so far bush has opposed any 
immediate funneling of western cash into the foundering soviet 
economy while kohl is pushing a 15 million package which could 
in turn enhance kremlin support of german reunification 
the summit partners were down to business after bush played host 
to a weekend welcoming party that had some of his guests slurping 
texas barbecue tossing horseshoes and applauding rodeo tricks 
both mitterrand and kohl arriving today missed bushs 
largerthanlife hoedown at the astroarena 
tomorrow we get to work i think were all working for the 
same thing for world peace and for harmony bush said at the end 
of a grand old opry performance featuring larry gatlin comedian 
minnie pearl and charley pride and loretta lynn 
the evening saw some unlikely sights as the foreign visitors 
gamely tried to emulate bushs exuberance for country fun 
margaret thatcher smartly dressed in a white and tan spring 
suit and clutching a white handbag gingerly tripped over the 
indoor rodeo dirt in her impeccable spectator shoes 
toshiki kaifu wildly waved a stetson matineecowboy style 
above his head as he was announced into the rodeo arena 
and a bluejeanclad brian mulroney tried his darndest to pitch 
horseshoes on astroturf topped with sawdust 
no matter that some of the foreign guests looked a bit stiff 
standing in a buffet barbecue line plates outstretched for potato 
salad and ribs or that the unmistakable countyfair smell of 
barnyard animals filled the air where sequined cowboys showed them 
lassos and saddles 
this after all was the ambiance of his adopted hometown which 
bush was eager to show off to guests who met a year ago in paris 
mulroney european community president jacques delors and bush 
wore the specially crafted cowboy boots given to each leader by 
local bootmaker rocky carroll 
kaifu didnt wear his boots but took great pride in showing off 
to mulroney the huge western belt buckle that he wore with gray 
slacks plaid jacket and loud print shirt 
the evening capped a day when bush remained true to his 
proclivity for engaging foreign heads of state in sports and 
relaxation he shot some baskets with mulroney in the elaborate 
gymnasium of the houstonian hotel complex where bush stays when he 
is in town 
he attended morning church services with thatcher

the judge presiding over raymond buckeys 
second molestation trial told jurors today they must not consider 
public opinion in their deliberations of charges involving the 
defunct mcmartin preschool 
the case was placed in the jurys hands after superior court 
judge stanley weisberg delivered 30 minutes of legal instructions 
buckey 32 is being tried for the second time on eight counts 
of child molestation at the nowdemolished school his family owned 
in manhattan beach he took the stand in both trials to deny he 
ever molested children 
the retrial which lasted just three months followed a nearly 
threeyear odyssey that became the nations longest and costliest 
criminal proceeding with costs topping 135 million it has been 
nearly seven years since buckey was first arrested 
weisberg told jurors they must not base their decision on 
public opinion or public feeling about the notorious case 
you must base your decision on the facts and the law he 
said you must not be biased against the defendant because he has 
been arrested for this crime or because he was brought to trial 
attending the hearing were a number of parents of former 
mcmartin students who had pressured district attorney ira reiner 
to pursue a retrial against buckey 
the first trial ended jan 18 with buckeys mother peggy 
mcmartin buckey acquitted of all charges and buckey acquitted on 
40 counts of sexually abusing children at the school 
jurors deadlocked on 13 other charges against him however and 
prosecutors refiled on eight of those counts 
the second trial involved testimony from three young girls who 
claimed buckey molested them when they were students at the 
preschool 
the defense alleged the children were influenced by therapists 
who interviewed them in the early stages of the case and suggested 
their testimony was unreliable 
prosecutors said the children should be believed although they 
acknowledged their memories had faded over the years 
the judge told jurors in his instructions you should not 
discount or distrust the testimony of a child or give it greater 
weight solely because the witness is a child

the chairman of a senate panel said today he 
would seek to subpoena former top thrift regulator m danny wall 
and a former aide to president bush to explain how an arizona man 
could buy 15 failing texas savings and loans by putting up only 
1000 of his own money 
i expect each of them they owe the public an 
explanation said sen howard metzenbaum dohio chairman of the 
senate subcommittee on antitrust monopolies and business rights 
among those to be subpoenaed within a week metzenbaum said are 
wall former chairman of the federal home loan bank board 
insurance executive james m fail of phoenix and robert j 
thompson a lobbyist and former congressional liaison for bush when 
he was vice president 
metzenbaums panel is investigating a federally approved deal in 
december 1988 in which fail was promised 18 billion in subsidies 
while putting up only 1000 of his own money and borrowing 70 
million to buy 15 sampls consolidated into the dallasbased 
bluebonnet savings 
metzenbaum said that wall fail and thompson refused to appear 
voluntarily before his panel 
thompson according to metzenbaums investigators pushed for 
approval of the fail deal and in 1989 borrowed more than 500000 
from companies controlled by fail 
metzenbaum said federal payments amounting to 23 million a 
month helped bluebonnet become the nations most profitable large 
savings and loan last year 
wall told the new york times i did nothing for bob thompson 
that i didnt do for anyone else there is nothing nefarious about 
it 
efforts to contact fail thompson and wall were unsuccessful 
sunday 
investigators said fail was allowed to acquire the institutions 
even though a company he controlled pleaded guilty o fraud in 
alabama in 1976 fail was indicted for securities fraud in that 
case but the charges against him were dropped and he agreed not to 
conduct any new business in the state 
the congressional panel is trying to determine why the bidding 
process for the failed sampls was concluded quickly why some federal 
bank board officials who raised questions about fail were 
overruled and what role was played by thompson 
the political implications of this deal need a lot of 
explaining metzenbaum said it appears from this particular 
instance the negotiators did not do their job very well 
george m barclay president of the federal home loan bank in 
dallas acknowledged in a telephone interview sunday that he wrote 
a letter overruling staff objections to fails eligibility for the 
deal the letter to federal regulators was necessary for fails 
approval as a buyer 
he said he could not recall why he came to that conclusion but 
acknowledged he may have acted in response to telephone calls from 
officials in washington but he said its absolutely not true 
that anybody attempted to influence me and that the letter 
raised a flag for regulators by mentioning fails past indictment 
he said the bank only certified to federal regulators that we 
felt based upon the information we had that we had no objection no 
legal objection to his acquiring the institution and that the 
bank would be able to properly regulate fails new institution 
the federal home loan bank boards regulatory functions were 
taken away and replaced by the office of thrift supervision an arm 
of the treasury department as part of the federal bailout of the 
savings and loan industry passed by congress last year

a man who pleaded guilty to raping a columbia 
university freshman got a reduced sentence because he agreed to be 
tested for aids according to published reports 
reginald darby 28 pleaded guilty in march to firstdegree rape 
in the knifepoint assault on a 17yearold in her dormitory room 
the reports said 
in a secret deal with the district attorneys office darby was 
promised that he would be sentenced to no more than five to 15 
years if he submitted to the test according to mondays editions 
of the new york times and the julyaugust issue of manhattan lawyer 
the maximum sentence for a firstdegree rape conviction is eight 
and onethird to 25 years they noted sentencing is scheduled for 
aug 3 
lisa friel an assistant prosecutor said on the court record 
that the sentence was contingent upon the defendant submitting to 
certain testing and making the results of the test available to the 
district attorneys office and other appropriate parties 
neither darbys attorney charles blakeley of the legal aid 
society nor friel would confirm that the test was for aids 
but other legal aid attorneys told manhattan lawyer that it was 
an aids test and said it was the first time that legal aid had 
worked out such a plea agreement for a rape defendant in manhattan 
however there are questions about the usefulness of the test 
if the rapist tests negative it does not guarantee that the victim 
is not at risk for aids because a person may be infected with aids 
and not yet have produced the antibodies detected by the most 
common test 
and if the rapist tests positive the victim may not have 
contracted the disease 
under new york law those charged with rape cannot be compelled 
to submit to aids tests at least eight states illinois oregon 
washington indiana georgia south carolina texas and colorado 
provide for mandatory aids testing in some cases the times said

the soviet union has shown progress toward 
dismantling the krasnoyarsk radar in siberia that it has said it 
will remove because it is in violation of the ussoviet 
antiballistic missile treaty the state department said monday 
department spokesman richard boucher asked about the status of 
the radar installation said we have indications that 
preparations are under way to begin dismantlement of the radar 
including the removal of some external equipment 
the department had said several months ago that indications were 
the soviets were preparing to dismantle the radar 
what was new in bouchers statement was the part about removing 
external equipment he declined to elaborate on it 
certainly the removal of some external equipment is progress 
but what really matters is the complete elimination of the radar 
he said 
boucher declined to give any timetable for the removal the 
united states has said however that it hopes to sign a strategic 
nuclear arms treaty with the soviet union by the end of the year 
and will not do so until the radar has been dismantled 
an administration official speaking on condition he not be 
identified said some of the external equipment had already been 
removed from the radar installation 
something is being removed the official said whether 
that involves actual dismantlement of the radar is something that i 
dont think we are prepared to say external equipment has been 
removed but that doesnt necessarily qualify as parts of the 
radar

the socialist defense minister won praise from the 
conservative opposition monday for pledging to maintain france as 
western europes top military power and adhere to its maverick 
nuclear policy 
in his address sunday minister jeanpierre chevenement also 
said france plans to keep its 50000 troops in germany for at least 
four more years 
chevenement was right to declare that all the dangers havent 
disappeared miraculously and that france must keep the means of 
defending its territory its expatriates and its positions in 
different parts of the world said pierreandre wiltzer an 
opposition legislator 
wiltzer a defense specialist for the centerright union for 
french democracy said there was a national consensus to maintain a 
strong military he said the defense budget should not be reduced 
some socialists have urged cuts in defense spending but 
chevenement thus far has the support of president francois 
mitterrand in opposing major budget reductions 
chevenement recalled that france refused to endorse a 
declaration at last weeks nato summit stipulating that the 
alliance would use nuclear weapons only as a last resort 
it was in our interests to refuse to go along with this idea 
that one uses nuclear weapons as a last resort when all would be 
lost he said at a forum sunday 
france would stick with its completely opposite strategy of 
nuclear deterrence he said this is extremely important for 
france and for europe 
surveys have shown that french voters across the political 
spectrum want to keep an independent force de frappe as the 
countrys nuclear arsenal is called 
france is the biggest military power in europe after the 
soviet union chevenement said and must maintain its capabilities 
in five years there will be a strategic void which is very 
dangerous because a void of arms can lead to outside interference 
wiltzer sounded a similar note in his statement 
if france is a nation that counts in europe and the world 
its due in large part to its defense to cast doubt on the 
coherence and credibility of this policy under the pretext of 
budget cuts or because of internal rivalries in the socialist party 
would be irresponsible 
chevenement rejected any suggestion that french troops withdraw 
from germany by the end of the year 
that wont happen for at least four or five years he said 
adding that withdrawal even then would depend on actions of the 
soviet union and coordination with western allies 
chevenement said the eventual withdrawal of the 50000 french 
troops would fit in with plans to trim the armed forces by 35000 
the defense minister said the tentative withdrawal plans have no 
bearing on a newly formed joint frenchgerman brigade

habitat for humanitys founder is keeping 
some people at arms length while its leaders and backers struggle 
with allegations that he improperly hugged and touched five female 
workers 
the allegations have sent founder millard fuller into near exile 
and put an uncharacteristic strain on habitat a strongly religious 
organization that uses sweat equity to build housing for the 
poor around the world it has a 50 million budget and 100000 us 
volunteers including former president carter 
it has been a situation that has caused a lot of pain because 
were all very close said claire williams spokeswoman for 
habitats board 
fuller who says he only touched the women in exuberant shows of 
friendship still can be found chatting with habitat volunteers 
but he avoids the headquarters and is careful how he greets people 
i no longer initiate hugs he said in an interview thursday 
when charges of this nature are made its very difficult to 
defend yourself 
no criminal charges have been filed against fuller 55 the 
women have not been identified and their allegations have been 
described only in general terms 
geoff van loucks chairman of habitat for humanity international 
inc has said the women alleged nothing criminal when they 
complained to a habitat chaplain 
they claim inappropriate comments and inappropriate hugging 
and touching theyve never ever claimed anything more nor is 
there a hint of anything more van loucks said let me make 
clear there was no sexual intercourse 
fuller who founded habitat with his wife linda also is to 
move his base of operations to atlanta because of a reorganization 
that was planned before the controversy he has gone from executve 
director to president 
the organization also hired the mennonite conciliation service 
to counsel fuller and the women but there have been divisions over 
whether enough has been done 
tim odonnell who recently finished a 2year term at the 
headquarters said he received a harsh handwritten note from carter 
after odonnell complained about the way the board investigated the 
claims against fuller 
you are either completely foolish or trying to sabotage the 
work of habitat said a copy of the letter provided by odonnell 
attacking millard fuller and the board of directors is a 
reprehensible act dont make it more difficult for those 
trying to resolve the problem 
carter spokeswoman carrie harmon declined to comment on the 
letters authenticity 
carter who annually spends at least a week working at habitat 
homebuilding projects has publicly defended fuller in a recent 
interview with the atlanta journalconstitution he said the nature 
of the accusations upset the extremely conservative board 
members who then were overly inclined to condemn fuller 
fuller still is a visible presence in americus a town of 16000 
about 10 miles from carters hometown of plains fuller now works 
out of his law office a few blocks from habitats headquarters 
fuller a former millionaire who gave away his money in 1970 and 
founded habitat in 1976 said he has apologized to all five women 
and met personally with three of them 
when someone says they have been offended the commonsense 
thing and the christian thing is to seek reconciliation he said 
im not trying to paint myself as a perfect person who has been 
victimized i obviously was not sensitive enough in my relations 
with these women 
back at habitat headquarters california businessman jeff 
snider who arrived thursday has taken over as executive vice 
president in charge of operations 
as a reporter arrived a male employee greeted a female 
receptionist with a hug 
ms williams the board spokeswoman said weve seen progress 
in the two or three months its been going on 
but odonnell said the controversy has taken a toll at the 
organization which has over 450 projects in the united states 
canada and australia and more than 80 in 26 developing countries 
people almost feel they have to take sides he said i 
know of a handful of people who have left because of the 
situation 
fuller said he wants to focus on the future 
he said his promotion to president and the opening of a habitat 
office in atlanta are part of a longrange plan developed last year 
that just happened to coincide with the controversy fuller said he 
helped pick snider to run habitat 
because of the timing it appears that im being run out of 
town said fuller i want us to get on with the business of 
building houses for the needy

leaders of the worlds richest nations began 
their 16th economic summit today urged by president bush to 
harness the power and energy of free wills and free markets to 
bolster the troubled economies of eastern europe and the soviet 
union 
the seven leaders were deeply divided on how and when to provide 
financial assistance sought by mikhail gorbachev but officials 
said a team of western bankers and other experts would be sent to 
assess soviet needs 
as the meetings began the leaders lined up about half on one 
side and half on the other over how to extend financial 
assistance to mikhail gorbachev said white house chief of staff 
john sununu 
bush has said he has big problems with extending direct aid 
to moscow until it reduces military spending moves more forcefully 
toward a freemarket system and curtails the 5 billion a year 
subsidy to cuba a gorbachev aide said monday that western aid must 
be unconditional explaining we arent taking orders 
bush met this morning with francois mitterrand and a french 
spokesman said both men stuck to their position bush opposes 
direct aid at least for now while mitterrand favors all aid 
that is serious and useful 
officials said the leaders would approve an assessment team to 
recommend applications for western assistance sununu said the 
study might be conducted by a mixture of western financing 
agencies including the world bank and the international monetary 
fund 
bush is offering the soviets technical assistance for 
transportation and agriculture and advice on developing freemarket 
mechanisms sununu pointed out that the soviets currently lose 
almost half their grain crop through faulty storage 
sununu noted that different countries view soviet circumstances 
in different ways perhaps a hint that bush will not staunchly 
oppose direct aid from france west germany and italy nations 
that are ready to proceed also meeting here are leaders from 
britain japan canada and the european economic community 
we are called upon as allies and as friends to work toward 
decisions that will bring new stability and prosperity to the 
world by tapping the power and energy of free wills and free 
markets bush said in a statement opening the summit 
these economic summits have become a framework for frank 
constructive dialogue a dialogue for progress that i believe will 
be advanced greatly in these next three days a new world of 
freedom lays before us hopeful confident a world where peace 
endures where commerce has conscience where all that seems 
possible is possible 
so let us begin in good faith to set the stage for the new 
millennium 
soviet aid questions were a highly charged and undecided issue 
as the threeday summit began decisions were likely to come 
wednesday in a final communique 
from moscow came a fresh plea for financial assistance foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze told reporters at the communist party 
congressi feel it would be advantageous for us and the west 
he said moscow was looking to the west for credit technical 
cooperation personnel training joint ventures and joint 
projects 
meanwhile the summit partners faced a tangle of their own 
differences over trade and the environment europeans are resisting 
bushs demand for phasing out farm subsidies over the next 10 years 
and together with canada are pushing for agreement on new steps 
to halt global warming 
sununu sniped at european critics of bushs goslow policy on 
curbing carbon dioxide and other pollutants blamed for warming the 
global environment 
i think west germany got a lot of good grades for rhetoric 
he said on abc if you take a good look at what the united states 
has actually done in terms of cleaning up our environment i 
dont think the united states has to take a back seat to anyone 
yet a prominent us environmental group the wilderness society 
quickly chimed in to say the us gets a failing grade no 
matter how governor sununu tries to rejigger the numbers 
before calling the summit into session on the campus of rice 
university bush met separately with mitterand and west german 
chancellor helmut kohl to discuss their 15billion aid proposal 
for moscow 
the world has changed dramatically since the last economic 
summit in paris at that time the west was considering a limited 
aid package to encourage the beginings of reform efforts in poland 
and hungary 
since that time the berlin wall has crumbled and most of the 
communist nations of eastern europe have been swept away leaving 
the west groping for a way to respond to the dramatic changes 
treasury secretary nicholas brady said today the chief message 
from houston will be to urge east european nations to undertake 
necessary economic reforms before they receive western assistance 
theres no sense in pouring money into a system that isnt 
ready to receive it he said on nbc 
despite temperatures in the 90s and humidity topping 80 percent 
the city of houston went all out to welcome the heads of 
government their contingents and hordes of reporters air 
conditioning was pumped onto the outddor platform to make the 
arrival ceremony comfortable for the leaders 
bush was host sunday night to a presummit rodeo complete with 
bareback riding barrel racing and a calf scramble 
japans toshiki kaifu a firsttime summiteer waived his cowboy 
hat as if hed been doing it all his life 
mitterrand italian prime minister giulio andreotti and kohl

west german team win soccers world cup andreotti was there to 
present it

where he saw the nato allies adopt a us proposal to rewrite 
natos warfighting strategy as a way of lessening tensions with 
the soviet union

for western help gorbachevs latest plea was expected to be aired

a day after cheering their soccer team to 
victory in the world cup germans woke up monday to hear of deaths 
broken glass and looted shops the aftermath of extremist rioting 
in both german states 
four people were killed and hundreds hurt when jubilant street 
celebrations turned reckless and violent following west germanys 
10 victory over argentina in rome on sunday 
bands of neonazi skinheads and other hooligans brawled with 
police in east berlin and in the west german cities of hamburg and 
bielefeld 
foreigners were singled out for attacks and stores were looted 
and vandalized nationwide police said 
more than 120 people were arrested and at least 60 police 
officers were among the injured 
the celebration was far more violent and nationalistic than the 
goodnatured euphoria that followed west germanys last cup 
championship in 1974 
it was also the first shared by east germany which is on the 
threshold of unifying with its western neighbor and rooted strongly 
for its neighboring team 
unification and rising german influence on world affairs has 
intensified patriotic feeling and spawned new extremism 
i was astonished by what had happened last night said 
detlev liepmann a sociologist at west berlins free university 
there is a special group at the right side of our spectrum who 
are searching for any occasion to do these sort of things 
about 20000 cheering flagwaving fans greeted the west german 
soccer team when it returned to frankfurt monday after taking the 
championship 
the peaceful display of pride was in sharp contrast to the ugly 
scenes of random violence that broke out the night before and 
lasted into the morning 
hundreds of thousands of people poured into the streets 
fireworks streaked the skies over several cities and a concert of 
honking horns lasted into the morning 
but in east berlin about 5000 youths watching the game on a 
huge television screen across from the parliament building began 
hurling bottles and demolishing concession stands when it ended 
a group of 500 neonazis shouting epithets against foreigners 
rampaged on the main square alexanderplatz chasing vietnamese 
workers and ransacking a bar frequented by homosexuals police and 
witnesses said 
a group of about 200 skinheads later tried to attack a house 
occupied by a leftist group and fought pitched battles with police 
twelve were arrested and three people were seriously hurt 
police said 
in hamburg about 400 hooligans and skinheads clashed with 
police with rocks and bottles fiftyfour police officers were 
injured and 88 people were arrested according to police 
windows of more than 20 stores were smashed one bar was 
destroyed and several police and private autos were damaged by the 
mob police said 
police used truncheons and water cannons to break up the crowd 
in the west german city of bielefeld about 200 neonazi 
skinheads attacked police with rocks and firebombs six officers 
were hurt and 13 people were arrested six police wagons were 
damaged authorities there said 
in cologne a mob surrounded a car driven by an 18yearold turk 
and threatened to lynch him police said the car was rocked and 
three people were hurt when the motorist attempted to drive away 
anetta kahane head of the east berlin office for foreigner 
affairs said monday that asians and africans living in the country 
are the target of daily attacks 
wolfgang schoenpflug a psychologist at the free university 
said resentment of foreigners is rising in both german states some 
of it influenced by east germany 
new emotions and attitudes are coming from the east where 
hostility against foreigners was suppressed but heavily present 
he said 
four people died in accidents related to the celebrations and 
hundreds were reported injured 
in cologne a reveler died when he smashed a window in a moving 
street car leaned out and was struck by a concrete pillar police 
said 
in the southwest west german city of heilbronn two people died 
when their car slammed into a lamppost in geislingen a speeding 
car with four fans smashed into a post killing one and seriously 
injuring three 
in the west german city of schwetzingen 37 people were injured 
when a fan drove his car into a crowd of 5000 people celebrating 
in the street

senior soviet officials said monday they would 
welcome western aid to help rebuild their country but they 
rejected attaching any conditions to such aid 
leaders of the worlds seven richest nations convened in 
houston texas on monday and aid to moscow was at the top of their 
agenda 
president bush has said he has big problems with pouring 
cash into an anemic soviet economy that still supports heavy 
defense spending and funnels 5 billion a year into marxist cuba 
deputy premier leonid abalkin in charge of soviet economic 
reform appeared to rule out any conditions for the aid 
any political conditions are unacceptable for negotiations 
with the soviet union abalkin said during a break in the 28th 
communist party congress 
an aide to mikhail s gorbachev said he viewed bushs concerns 
as conditions 
to dictate conditions to such a country as the soviet union a 
great power is embarrassing said gorbachev staff member georgy 
shakhnazarov we arent taking orders 
the urgings from the west could also backfire he warned 
playing into the hands of soviet officials who consider that any 
foreign help would be insulting 
such officials he said believe accepting western aid would 
mean we will be selling our national interests 
gorbachev is worried his country cannot make the painful leap to 
a market system without western credits and wants help from the 
industrial powers to stop soviet economic decline 
the most prominent conservative in the soviet leadership yegor 
k ligachev said the west could try to push moscow in a direction 
he opposes 
if conditions are attached to these lines of credit such 
as a move toward a free market economy or private property then 
ligachev is against it he said at the party congress 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze was more conciliatory 
we understand if no one wants to take a risk the usa isnt 
speaking in favor of development of economic cooperation if reform 
doesnt proceed as we plan he said 
such aid he said would be advantageous for us and the 
west 
soviet officials offered their first detailed list of what kind 
of help they want from the west 
shakhnazarov said the soviet union would like western technology 
for quick construction of small businesses to produce consumer 
goods and food items in short supply gorbachev has made 
improvements in both a top priority 
the soviet economy also suffers from inflation and a huge budget 
deficit 
help in organizing market mechanisms such as banking finance 
and management also are priorities the gorbachev aide said 
in return shakhnazarov said moscow could offer the west help 
in converting the defense industry to produce civilian goods 
gorbachev has launched a program to tap highly developed defense 
plants to assist the civilian sector 
the leaders of west germany and france advocate helping the 
soviet union despite disagreements over cuba and have called for 
15 billion in aid to bolster reform plans 
asked whether the soviet union would cut aid to cuba 
shevardnadze said that was strictly a question of bilateral 
relations and did not indicate the governments plans 
credits would help soviet businesses pay bills to western 
companies the soviet union traditionally has been punctual in 
making such payments and recent delays have eroded confidence among 
foreign investors 
west germany already has granted an unconditional loan of 31 
billion 
estimates of how much money the soviet union would need to begin 
to stabilize its economy range from 5 billion to 20 billion

allan boesak resigned his church positions after press reports 
alleged he was having an affair with a white television star 
church officials said monday 
boesak was in seclusion and his lawyers said he had nothing to 
say after telling his congregation sunday that he was stepping 
down boesak who is married said he had done nothing wrong but 
had to resign 
this is one of the darkest days of my life he told the 
congregation of the ned geref sendingkerk church in cape towns 
bellville south area where he served for 21 years 
i am deeply sorry for all the pain i have caused he said 
boesak a leader of the mixedrace community had become a 
prominent antiapartheid leader in recent years he helped lead 
campaigns against whiteminority rule and toured the world to 
denounce apartheid 
boesak resigned after south african newspapers reported he was 
romantically involved with elna botha who works for the state 
south african broadcasting corporation mrs botha is a star and 
producer of good morning south africa a news and entertainment 
show 
mrs bothas husband tv news anchorman colin fluxman was taken 
off the air monday after breaking down as he read a news report 
about his wife and boesak during good morning south africa 
business day newspaper reported monday that fluxman said the 
couple were divorcing 
church officials said boesak and his wife dorothy had not 
decided whether they would divorce according to news reports 
walter sisulu a senior leader of the african national congress 
the main black opposition group said monday boesaks resignation 
would not harm the movement boesak has been an anc ally 
its really a personal matter a love affair is a personal 
matter sisulu said at a press conference 
the incident was seen as a moral rather than a racial scandal 
apartheid legislation banning interracial sex was dropped in 1985 
boesak was temporarily suspended from his church posts in 1985 
after allegations he was having an affair with a church worker he 
was later reinstated

himself to a political career he has strong ties to the african 
national congress and other antiapartheid groups

beyond his role in the antiapartheid movement 
boesak modeled himself on american black civil rights leader 
rev martin luther king jr he developed a vivid speaking style and 
often led nonviolent marches and demonstrations 
rev johan retief leader of the council at boesaks church 
said church leaders were stunned and trying to decide what to do 
we do not take this lightly he said 
south african newspapers said monday boesak was also resigning

whatever their differences on a formal framework 
the prosperous western democracies are gearing up for a 
multibilliondollar effort to protect mikhail gorbachev from the 
economic morass that threatens his hold on soviet power 
long lines and restive consumers give ample evidence that 
gorbachevs economic reforms need an infusion of imagination and 
cash 
inability to keep food stores stocked has already forced moscow 
to spend an extra 3 billion rubles 500 million on food 
imports the white house says half the soviet grain crop goes bad 
before it gets to the marketplace 
the french and germans want to provide billions of dollars the 
sooner the better the united states leads a goslow faction that 
includes japan and britain even so american officials are 
briefing reporters at the economic summit on a us drive to help 
soviet agriculture and transportation 
seventythree years after the russian revolution soviet 
officials emphasized on monday that assistance could not carry 
western conditions we arent taking orders said gorbachev 
aide georgy shaknazarov 
but bush has three main objections to offering direct aid the 
soviets heavy military spending their sending 5 billion a year 
in aid to marxist cuba and their slow pace in adapting to 
capitalistic ways 
it was vaguely possible that summit leaders might attempt to set 
specific conditions concerning one or more of those problems before 
approving aid 
the soviets are open about their need for western help i feel 
it would be advantageous for us and the west said foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze he said he disliked the term aid 
preferring credit technical cooperation personnel training 
joint ventures and joint projects a message welcome to bush 
only a year ago the united states britain france canada 
west germany japan and italy stepped gingerly into these uncharted 
waters and decided to help poland and hungary the soviet union 
presents a far more difficult decision 
bush entered the summit discussions already committed to 
providing technical assistance 
that may be as far as he is ready to go for now but bush 
doesnt seem to feel so strongly that he would try to block others 
from more ambitious assistance west germany alone hopes to make 
31 billion in loans available and is leading the push for an 
overall western aid package in excess of 15 billion 
the president has understood different countries may have 
different ways of evaluating specific changes in the soviet 
union chief of staff john sununu said monday 
from the french delegation meanwhile came a statement of 
renewed determination to bolster gorbachev and the soviet economy 
with all aid that is serious and useful 
the leaders may endorse diversity when they address aid to the 
soviet union in their wednesday communique each nation would be 
free to go its separate way 
but the summit nations are planning to act in concert in 
dispatching teams of bankers and other experts to assess soviet 
needs 
failure of perestroika could mean gorbachevs downfall and begin 
an era of instability across the soviet union where would the west 
be asked brian mulroney of canada if they chuck him out 
us officials make this kind of case for moving slowly 
it is impossible to keep tabs on assistance many of the 
billions could be diverted to the red army where the generals and 
gorbachev do not always see eye to eye 
it doesnt make sense to send billions to the soviets while 
they are sending billions to cuba a state whose interests often 
collide with the united states mulroney agrees with bush that 
soviet aid to cuba is profoundly unacceptable and he said 
canada was willing to provide trade credits not direct assistance 
the soviet economy is so messed up that immediate aid will be 
wasted treasury secretary nicholas brady said monday theres no 
sense in pouring money into a system that isnt ready to receive 
it

the doctor who performed the worlds first 
successful liver transplant was recovering monday following surgery 
to remove blockage in one of his coronary arteries officials said 
dr thomas e starzl 64 was alert and resting comfortably at 
presbyterianuniversity hospital where he has performed hundreds 
of transplants during the past nine years said dr bruce wilson 
director of the university of pittsburghs heart institute 
doctors removed a severe blockage from starzls right coronary 
artery sunday after he complained of chest pains wilson said the 
artery was 99 percent blocked 
hes doing quite well wilson told reporters we expect a 
speedy recovery 
because the blockage was not total starzls heart muscle did 
not appear to be damaged wilson said the two remaining arteries 
look pretty normal he said 
starzl gained attention in 1967 when he performed the worlds 
first successful liver transplant at the university of colorado he 
also pioneered the development of a medical team that performed 200 
kidney transplants at colorado general and denver veterans 
administration hospitals 
in 1981 starzl began work at the university of pittsburgh 
which he helped make the worlds premier transplant center last 
year the hospital performed more than 460 liver transplants and 
210 kidney transplants 
wilson said a severe blockage of the kind starzl had can occur 
suddenly when blood strips away crusted plaque lining the arteries 
and causes a larger buildup farther along in the artery people who 
disregard the first symptoms of pain run the risk of a complete 
blockage which can cause a heart attack and permanent damage he 
said 
wilson said he will monitor starzls condition the next few days 
and ask him to restrict his work schedule but he added it may be 
difficult to persuade the energetic surgeon to slow down 
a person like tom starzl might have more stress if you inhibit 
him he said

a judge today denied a request to 
postpone the case of ramon salcido who is accused of killing seven 
people in a wine country murder spree clearing the way for the 
trial to begin next week 
sonoma county public defender marteen miller requested a 
continuance for at least two months but prosecutors argued against 
the delay and visiting judge reginald littrell of sierra county 
agreed with them 
salcido 29 is accused of murdering his wife two of his 
daughters his motherinlaw her two other daughters and a 
coworker in sonoma county 15 months ago a third daughter whose 
throat was slit survived the attack 
miller who claims his client has a brain dysfunction and also 
was illegally extradited from mexico said last week he had more 
than enough to justify a twomonth continuance 
the exchanges between miller and district attorney peter bumerts 
today were sometimes bitter salcido who appeared in court with a 
spanish language interpreter listened to the proceedings 
attentively 
at one point miller argued that a delay was justified because 
a mans life is at stake 
if mr salcido had had the same consideration for the seven 
people he killed maybe we wouldnt be here countered bumerts 
investigators say salcido killed his wife angela because he 
suspected she was unfaithful he told authorities bouts with 
alcohol and cocaine preceded the attacks 
the case was moved to san mateo county because of widespread 
publicity miller had said he would seek a second change of venue 
because of similar media coverage in the new locale but no such 
request was made today 
jury selection is due to begin next week after the lawyers and 
the judge work out the list of questions to ask prospective jurors 
besides domestic distrust investigators say salcido was upset 
because he had been ordered to make back childsupport payments to 
his first wife a woman angela salcido had known nothing about 
until the order the couple had a daughter before they divorced 
in statements to sonoma county sheriffs detectives while 
returning to the united states he allegedly said he took his 
daughters theresa 1 sofia 4 and carmina 3 to a county dump 
and slit their throats 
carmina survived and told police daddy cut me 
salcido allegedly said he then drove to his inlaws house 
where he knocked out his 47yearold motherinlaw marion louise 
richards before cutting the throats of her daughters ruth 12 
and marie 8 he stabbed their mother to death as she regained 
consciousness authorities said 
salcido allegedly said he then returned home beat his wife and 
shot her with a 22caliber pistol 
he told detectives he thought about killing himself but instead 
drove to the grand cru winery where he worked and fatally shot 
coworker tracey toovey 35 salcido said he then went to the house 
of another coworker ken butti 33 who was shot but survived 
miller has said he will argue that his client had an organic 
brain dysfunction and was suffering from psychotic depression 
at the time of the slayings

gov buddy roemer said monday he had 
questions about the constitutionality of a record labeling bill 
that could become the first law of its kind in the nation 
roemer said he favors warning labels on objectionable recordings 
but would prefer that the industry do it voluntarily 
the industry has begun a voluntary labeling program but it was 
not stringent enough for the legislature which overwhelmingly 
passed the bill saturday the measure also bans the sale of labeled 
records to minors 
the measure was approved a day before the legislature passed a 
bill that could become the nations most stringent state abortion 
law 
roemer who is still pondering the abortion measure also said 
he had not decided whether to sign or veto the record labeling 
bill it would mandate labels for recordings with themes of rape 
murder suicide incest illegal drug use child abuse and satanic 
worship 
during a news conference roemer said he had serious legal 
questions about the bills constitutionality those questions have 
to be balanced with concerns about the content of some recordings 
he said 
roemer said most of the industry was acting responsibly but 
some portions of the industry produce pure trash parents dont 
know that until they are brought home and played 
the governor said he preferred a voluntary program similar to 
the ratings system adopted by the movie industry well all be 
better off he said 
in may the recording industry unveiled a voluntary labeling 
system that it hoped would halt state campaigns for mandatory 
labeling industry spokesmen said every legislature except 
louisianas pulled back their bills while the voluntary program was 
tested 
the voluntary program went into effect this month and labeled 
recordings already are showing up in stores said mike cutshaw an 
attorney representing the national association of recording 
merchandisers 
last week capitol records promised to provide legal help to 
store operators who are threatened with arrest for selling its 
recordings that bear labels warning consumers of sexually explicit 
lyrics 
although the labeling bill passed both chambers with more than 
the twothirds vote needed to override a veto the legislative 
session was to end monday night and a veto would kill it until the 
next session which begins in april roemer has 20 days to decide 
on the bill after it reaches his desk 
under the legislation record manufacturers would be required to 
label recordings with objectionable lyrics retailers would be 
subject to misdemeanor criminal penalties for selling labeled 
recordings to those under age 17 
the producers of the grammy awards show have said such a law 
would scuttle louisianas chances of being host of the event also 
backers of a proposed grammy hall of fame in new orleans say the 
law would end their project and cost the city 100 million a year 
state rep ted haik the bills sponsor told reporters he 
believed the bill was constitutional he said that unlike the movie 
industry the recording industry is spread out among companies of 
all sizes and difficult to regulate voluntarily 
the legislation would not take effect until 1992 haik has said 
that if the industry implements its voluntary program he would 
push for repeal of the law

here are president bushs welcoming remarks 
monday at the economic summit 
well welcome to houston and we think this city a very 
appropriate place to host this economic summit not of the postwar 
era but of the postpostwar era 
and over the past decade and a half the leaders of the largest 
industrialized democracies have held these summits to address 
common problems and challenges 
these economic summits have become a framework for frank and 
constructive dialogue a dialogue for progress that i believe will 
be advanced greatly in these next three days 
and together were called upon as allies and as friends to work 
toward decisions here in houston that will bring a new stability 
and prosperity to the world by tapping the power and energy of 
free wills and free markets 
a new world of freedom lays before us hopeful confident a

two hungry black bears damaged cars and 
paid an unwelcome call on a camper prompting authorities to close 
two campsites until the animals can be captured a national forest 
spokeswoman said monday 
the bears have been spotted in the pemigewasset wilderness of 
the white mountain national forest 
theyve damaged some vehicles that belong to some of the 
volunteers that work for the forest service said alexis jackson 
a spokeswoman for the white mountain national forest on sunday 
night they entered a tent that a woman was sleeping in 
jackson said the female camper was not injured she did not have 
the womans name and said a report had not been filed yet 
i dont know if she had food in the tent with her or just had 
clothes on that she wore when she cooked jackson said 
the smell of food doesnt have to be very strong to attract 
bears they have a very sensitive sense of smell she said 
the damaged vehicles were at parking lots up to five miles from 
the campsites 
jackson said forest service employees placed traps to catch the 
animals so they can be moved to a more remote area 
no one has gotten a good look at the bears because they have 
turned up mainly at night but both are fairly large she said 
we see a lot of bear up in there but they dont normally 
bother people she said black bear are kind of reclusive and 
they dont usually bother people 
the last time jackson said she could determine that bears had 
bothered campers and hikers in the national forest was in 1980 
when bears also began raiding campsites for food she said she has 
not found any record of anyone being killed by a black bear in new 
hampshire

the supreme court said monday it would not 
free a texas television reporter serving a sixmonth jail term for 
refusing to reveal the name of a confidential source 
the justices by a 72 vote rejected an emergency request by 
reporter brian karem of kmoltv in san antonio 
justices william j brennan and thurgood marshall voted to grant 
karems request that he be freed pending his appeal of the judges 
contempt order that led to his jailing 
karem was jailed june 27 after refusing to disclose the identity 
of a source who helped arrange his telephone interview last year 
with jailed murder suspect henry hernandez 
hernandez is charged with fatally shooting san antonio police 
officer gary williams in march 1989 
attorneys in the murder trial of hernandez and his brother 
julian have said they need to know who arranged the interview to 
assure a fair trial and determine whether the interview should be 
admitted as evidence 
henry hernandez said in the interview that he shot the officer 
in selfdefense 
sheriff harlow copeland of bexar county texas said last week 
that he tracked down the source who helped karem and identified the 
individual as hernandezs cousin 
karem has refused to say whether the cousin was the source 
supreme court justice byron r white on june 28 denied an 
earlier bid by karem to be freed karem renewed his request by 
asking brennan for help and brennan referred the matter to the 
full court 
meanwhile the society of professional journalists called sunday 
for karems immediate release and commended the reporter and his 
station for their dedication and willingness to stand by the 
principles in which we believe even in the face of such adversity 
and at the cost of such high personal sacrifice

the kgb chief said monday that eight soviet 
intelligence agents have defected to the west since 1979 and a spy 
from an unidentified foreign power was arrested in the past three 
weeks 
vladimir a kryuchkov answering questions from delegates to the 
28th congress of the communist party denied accusations by a 
former kgb general that the agency was ineffective in its 
counterintelligence and intelligence operations and had spied on 
soviet citizens 
all these are baldfaced lies said kryuchkov who as a 
member of the politburo was required by the congress to account for 
his activities and answer questions 
former kgb maj gen oleg d kalugin has caused a sensation in 
the soviet media since he surfaced last month accusing the kgb of 
spying on the leaders of strike committees and emerging political 
groups of running weak counterintelligence operations and of 
having spy rings around the world blown through the defections of 
key agents 
kryuchkov defended the government for stripping kalugin of his 
rank of major general and all of his service awards the order was 
signed by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev who has not 
commented publicly on the issue 
kryuchkov said the committee for state security kgb 
acknowledges that failures and errors in personnel selection that 
sometimes cause severe losses 
but he said in the last 11 years eight of our agents have 
gone into the service of the west not 20 as kalugin claims 
kryuchkov also said that about three weeks ago another 
foreign intelligence agent was arrested we did not report that an 
investigation is under way whose results will be communicated to 
the public 
he also cited the arrest of two other alleged spies a 
tolkachev who worked in a sensitive military field and a man 
named polyakov who he said spied for 25 years 
the kgb has been waging a propaganda campaign against kalugin 
and kryuchkov carried it into the kremlin palace of congresses 
where the communist congress was meeting 
delegates asked me to talk about about kalugin kryuchkov 
said he was accepted into the service of the kgb in 1952 with 
the help of his father a career officer in the nkvd a 
forerunner of the kgb 
kalugins career started to take off in the 1970s in 1970 he 
became chief of internal counterintelligence and quickly attained 
the rank of general when kalugin climbed the service staircase he 
said nothing critical about the organs of state security or our 
political system said kryuchkov 
but a complex situation involving him arose in 1979 the 
leadership of the committee on state security was forced to make a 
decision that he could no longer work in intelligence he said 
he did not give particulars but said that as a result of his 
incompetence and breaches of discipline we lost a valuable source 
of information 
kalugin was transferred to leningrad but ran afoul of 
authorities there too and was retired at age 55 said the kgb 
chief 
on retirement kalugin tried to bargain with the leaders of 
the kgb and threatened to turn to the press but the kgb 
refused kryuchkov said 
and kalugin soon started to carry out his threats on june 14 
he gave a speech on radio liberty the usgovernment funded 
radio station broadcasting to the soviet union from west germany 
he waged a steady campaign against the organs of state 
security in interviews with the soviet and foreign press in 
speeches and on television he presented the kgb as an allpowerful 
monster an organization of penetrating all spheres of society 
kryuchkov said 
the kgb was said to be putting the brakes on the reform and 
democratization of the country kalugin portrayed the majority 
of contemporary chekists kgb officers as open stalinists 
kryuchkov said 
he denied all of kalugins allegations

engineers at rockwell international in 
california may have located the source of a mysterious hydrogen 
leak that grounded the space shuttle fleet officials said today 
nasa spokesman kyle herring at the johnson space center in 
houston said that tests on sunday found hydrogen pouring from 
plumbing attachments that had been removed from space shuttle 
columbia 
it was not immediately clear now long it would take to fix the 
leak and resume flights with the threevehicle space shuttle fleet 
william lenoir associate administrator for space flight at 
nasa said investigators found a significant leak but said 
they dont know which seal valve or pipe in the maze of tubes is 
specifically leaking we havent eliminated any suspects he 
said 
lenoir said engineers are looking hardest at a ushaped teflon 
seal that prevents leakage at a joint where the external tank is 
jettisoned from the shuttle during launch 
herring said how big the leak rate is they dont know yet 
they did get some sort of leak its on the orbiter side he 
said the winged spacecraft that carries the astronauts is called 
the orbiter 
rockwell was testing an apparatus called the umbilical this is 
a group of pipes and valves that link the orbiter with the external 
tank the large orange tank that holds the rocket propellant for 
the shuttles main rocket engines during launch 
nasa discovered a leak somewhere in the umbilical plumbing in 
may when columbias external tank was being loaded with rocket 
propellant the source of the leak could not be found and nasa 
rolled columbia back to the hanger and dismantled the umbilical it 
was sent to rockwell for testing 
engineers found a leak on space shuttle atlantis that was 
similar to the one on columbia nasa space flight chief william 
lenoir ordered the space shuttle fleet grounded until the source of 
the leak could be found and fixed 
lenoir said friday that the rockwell test was a key move toward 
correction of the leak 
he said a leak test is now planned for late this week on 
atlantis which is still sitting on a launch pad at the kennedy 
space center

prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing 
cabinet easily survived its first test of no confidence on monday 
when parliament rejected five motions over a housing shortage and 
new jewish settler guard units in the occupied lands 
a close vote had been anticipated in the 120member knesset 
where a coalition headed by shamirs rightwing likud bloc has a 
narrow majority of 62 seats the opposition has a total of 58 
seats including 38 held by likuds major rival the centerleft 
labor party 
but following a fivehour debate the five motions of no 
confidence were defeated 60 to 51 five legislators put themselves 
on record as abstaining and four did not vote 
one leftwing legislator avraham poraz of the shinui party 
decided not to vote to cancel out the absence of sara doron of 
likud who was hospitalized after heart surgery 
poraz told israel radio he acted on moral grounds after 
hearing likud was considering taking doron by ambulance to vote if 
a majority was not assured 
two other legislators also did not vote 
the motions against shamir were filed by five leftwing parties 
and won support from the labor party headed by former prime 
minister shimon peres 
it was the first threat to shamirs coalition made up of 10 
religious and ultranationalist parties since it was installed 
june 11 at the end of a threemonth political crisis 
the political crisis began march 15 when labor toppled a joint 
coalition with likud in a parliamentary vote of no confidence as a 
protest against shamirs opposition to us proposals for 
israelipalestinian peace talks 
mondays motions focused on a housing shortage at a time when 
thousands of soviets are emigrating to israel in the past month 
hundreds of homeless israelis have pitched tents in public parks 
around the country to dramatize the issue 
also on the agenda were motions against the governments recent 
decision to set up civil guard units in the occupied west bank the 
government earlier announced approval of two units but revealed 
monday that five were actually approved 
defense minister moshe arens told parliament the jewish settlers 
in the occupied lands deserved the same protection as all the 
citizens of the state 
but critics fear these units could spur further jewish vigilante 
attacks on arabs and exacerbate the 31monthold palestinian 
uprising against israel in the occupied lands

israeli warplanes blasted bases of the 
proiranian hezbollah for a second day monday killing 12 people 
and raising fears the violence might thwart the anticipated release 
of a western hostage 
police said eight civilians and four combatants of hezbollah or 
party of god were killed twentyeight others including 10 
fighters were wounded they said 
a police spokesman said four usbuilt f4 phantom fighter 
bombers mounted two bombing runs 10 minutes apart on loweizeh and 
melita in southern lebanon 
palls of black smoke hung over the stricken targets in iqlim 
altuffah or the apple region overlooking israels 
selfdesignated security zone the spokesman said 
the attacks came a day after israeli jets had flattened a 
hezbollah base two miles to the south three fighters were killed 
and 12 wounded in sundays raid 
in jerusalem the israeli military command said its warplanes 
struck targets used by hezbollah for organizing and launching 
attacks and returned safely it did not elaborate 
later monday israeli artillerymen in the security zone traded 
heavy artillery fire with hezbollah positions north of the buffer 
police and un sources said 
a un source said at that one point the international 
peacekeepers monitored a barrage of 12 katyusha rockets fired by 
hezbollah into the security zone which israel established in 1985 
the source spoke on condition of anonymity 
voice of the south the radio of the israelibacked south 
lebanon army militia said three people were killed and five 
wounded in the barrage 
mondays air attack was israels third in four days and 15th 
this year in 14 previous raids 19 people were killed and 51 
wounded 
the sudden escalation of violence coincided with reports that a 
western hostage most probably a european would soon be freed by 
moslem captors 
let us pray the israeli attacks will not scuttle efforts to 
free one of the hostages said a shiite source close to 
hezbollahs iranianbacked leadership 
the hostageholders are definitely restless but i personally 
believe irans pressure will probably override the impact of the 
attacks he said on condition of anonymity 
danny neveh spokesman for defense minister moshe arens 
rejected any links between the raids and hostages and said the 
timing of the air strikes was based only on our operating policy 
against terrorism 
an israeli government source said the timing of the latest raids 
might look unfortunate but could be the result of a lack of 
coordination between the military and political echelons in israel 
he spoke on condition of anonymity 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said 
the united states views the attacks as part of the cycle of 
violence which harms all the parties in the region 
we are against all acts of violence committed by different 
groups in southern lebanon he said 
shiite fundamentalists accuse western governments of favoring 
israel and hold them responsible for its actions against arabs 
a shiite source who requested anonymity said tehran was 
pushing hard for the release of a hostage in appreciation for aid 
it received after the june 21 killer earthquake there 
he would not speculate on the identity of the hostage despite 
expectations in beirut london and dublin that it would probably be 
irish educator brian keenan 
the irish red cross flew the first western relief plane into 
tehran after the earthquake in which 40000 people were killed 
the hostages are six americans four britons two west germans 
two swiss an irishman and an italian the longest held is terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated press 
he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
a source close to the syrian command in moslem west beirut said 
sunday he did not expect a hostage to be freed before the middle of 
the week 
syria lebanons main power broker has 40000 troops in control 
of 70 percent of lebanons territory under a 1976 arab league 
mandate to snuff out the civil war now in its 16th year 
the syrians were instrumental in the release of american 
hostages robert polhill on april 22 and frank reed on april 30

rays of sun powered wheels of 
thunder on 31 exotically styled cars that hit the road monday in a 
1600mile race 
the shiny lowslung vehicles caused many doubletakes among 
motorists along us 192 shortly after leaving their starting point 
at walt disney world 
all of the automobiles for the 11day gm sunrayce usa were 
designed and built by college engineering students from the united 
states and canada at costs ranging from about 30000 to more than 
1 million 
the cars are powered strictly by the sun and solarenergy 
storage batteries 
the winner will have the lowest elapsed time over secondary 
roads in eight states the race is in daily stages with each car 
starting at the same point each day it ends july 19 at the general 
motors technical center outside detroit 
gm president bob stempel said he hoped the race would serve as 
an incentive for young people to study science and engineering 
among the entries was a pontoonlike auto with two drivers in 
fishbowlshaped cockpits facing in opposite directions that ones 
from western washington university 
the sunshine special from florida institute of technology 
features wraparound solar cells including the bottom of the car to 
catch sunlight reflected off the road 
midnight sun from the university of waterlooontario 
canada looks like a flying saucer gliding down the highway and 
the university of texas reportedly spent more than 1 million on 
its 340pound dynamo made out of carbon graphite 
many of the entrants and officials were talking about the unique 
solar array on the bottom of floridas car which professor bill 
thrasher said was a closely guarded secret for almost two years 
thrasher said tests showed that the reflected solar energy was 
about onethird as much as that captured from the top of the car 
the entry cost 225000 to build the governors energy office 
contributed 95000 the rest came from about 40 sponsors 
the auto from massachusetts institute of technology is a squat 
buglike affair with only the drivers head showing it cost only 
30000 to build said mit driver thomas massie 
tuesdays leg from floral city will end in tallahassee 192 
miles away by the planned rural route wednesday the drivers hope 
the cars will run 205 miles from tallahassee to montgomery ala 
via georgia 
the race is sponsored by gm the us department of energy and 
the society of automotive engineers gm and the energy department 
provided each school with 7000 in seed money to start their 
projects last year 
the top two finishers and a third selected for technological 
innovation will be sent by gm to compete in the 1990 world solar 
challenge in australia 
we want to encourage students to pursue science and 
engineering in the future said stempel 
the other states along the route are tennessee kentucky 
indiana and ohio

the soviet union facing a lack of fuel for 
domestic use will cut its oil exports by 140000 barrels a day 
according to premier nikolai i ryzhkov 
the soviet union is the worlds largest oil producer although 
production levels have been declining the us government 
estimated 1989 total soviet oil output at 1214 million barrels per 
day 
production has fallen because of the cost of maintaining output 
as well as ethnic unrest in oil producing regions such as 
azerbaijan 
ryzhkov said the government decided in late june to cut its oil 
exports by 7 million metric tons or 140000 barrels a day 
the cut in exports would apply to socialist bloc countries as 
well as western nations he said saturday answering questions by 
delegates to the 28th communist party congress on the upcoming 
soviet harvest 
this will permit us to supply our agriculture ryzhkov said 
adding that otherwise fuel shortages would hurt the harvest

two weeks after a pregnant fbi informant 
was slain last year state police had evidence that a federal agent 
was her lover and may have played a role in her disappearance 
according to a published report 
but eight months went by before investigators focused their 
probe on former fbi special agent mark putnam he confessed last 
month to strangling ms smith on june 8 1989 during a dispute 
over her expected child 
some outside law enforcement experts said police erred by not 
making putnam the prime suspect earlier the lexington 
heraldleader reported sunday 
in a controversial plea agreement the day he was indicted 
putnam pleaded guilty on june 12 to manslaughter he immediately 
received a 16year prison sentence ms smiths family outraged at 
the deal wanted him to stand trial for murder 
john paul runyon the commonwealths attorney in eastern 
kentuckys pike county said last month that without putnams 
confession we had absolutely no evidence to prosecute the 
former agent 
afterward the heraldleader reviewed the state police case 
file interviewed investigators and witnesses and asked several 
law enforcement experts to examine the file and evaluate the 
investigation 
the newspaper concluded that authorities might have been able 
to build a case against putnam if they had reacted promptly to 
information that pointed to him 
two weeks after ms smith disappeared on june 8 1989 police 
knew she may have been pregnant by putnam the newspaper reported 
police also knew putnam threatened her before when she discussed 
the pregnancy and ms smith was expecting putnam to pick her up at 
a hotel the day she disappeared according to the newspaper 
further putnam and his partner special agent ron poole were 
giving contradictory accounts of why smith was at the motel the 
newspaper said 
there was plenty of physical evidence that they could have 
developed said anthony v bouza a former police chief of 
minneapolis 
police did no laboratory examination of the motel room where ms 
smith and putnam stayed the night before her death or of the 
belongings she left there bouza said and they didnt quickly 
locate the rental car putnam was driving when he killed ms smith 
state police detective richard ray the lead investigator 
acknowledged it was kind of awkward to investigate an fbi agent 
but i tried to think of everything he added i did 
suspect from the start that something could have happened 
something very bad 
state police capt gary rose said authorities wanted to 
eliminate stronger suspects including ms smiths estranged 
husband before pursuing putnam 
detectives were not even convinced ms smith was dead until last 
christmas when she didnt contact her two children police said 
the agent was questioned june 20 1989 and offered to take a 
lie detector test rose said putnam became the prime suspect in 
february when he refused to take a polygraph 
george parry a former head of special investigations for the 
philadelphia district attorney and a former federal organized crime 
prosecutor said state police made a sincere effort but parry said 
the fbi should not have allowed the suspects partner poole to 
investigate smiths disappearance 
the fbi has declined requests from the associated press and the 
lexington newspaper to interview poole

saudi arabia has signed an agreement to 
purchase 315 of the armys most advanced tanks in a deal worth more 
than 3 billion the pentagon announced monday 
the m1a2 tank the most uptodate version of the abrams the 
armys main battle tank is manufactured by the lands systems 
division of general dynamics corp 
the tanks are scheduled for delivery from 1993 through 1995 
defense secretary dick cheney citing lessening chances for us 
involvement in a major european land war had proposed terminating 
the m1 tank program in fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 
the saudi deal means that the nations tank production lines at 
plants in lima ohio and warren mich will not be shutting down 
sen carl levin dmich applauded the arrangement as good 
news for michigan and for the nation 
rep michael oxley rohio said the saudi order alone isnt 
enough to prevent scheduled cutbacks at the two plants but will 
enable the united states to offer lower prices for tank sales to 
other countries 
the 3 billion agreement includes support equipment spare 
parts training munitions and the construction of maintenance 
facilities the pentagon said in a statement 
the m1a2 version is outfitted with a 120mm gun and toughened 
armor to protect it against sovietproduced antitank weapons 
systems 
it also features special viewers for the gunner and tank 
commander that will allow each to seek out targets in the dark 
the systems are separate from one another enabling the gunner 
to shoot at one target while the commander seeks out the next one 
congress was told last year that the deal was pending bush 
administration officials have said that united states would ensure 
that israel maintains a qualitative edge over arab armed forces 
oxley said the saudis wanted to tanks to patrol their border 
with iraq

americans took out 39 billion more in 
consumer credit than they paid off in may 10 times the amount 
incurred only a month earlier the government said monday 
the federal reserve said consumer credit increased at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 65 percent up from the 
previous months 06 percent growth rate net new debt in april 
totaled 390 million 
it was the highest annual rate of increase since a 75 percent 
rate in october when americans borrowed 44 billion more than they 
paid off 
the may increase was concentrated in credit card debt which 
rose 31 billion or an annual rate of 185 percent 
consumers who account for about twothirds of us economic 
activity had appeared to be more cautious in their borrowing and 
spending in recent months 
analysts had attributed the slower pace to high interest rates 
waning confidence because of adverse economic news and to the high 
level of debt already held by many americans 
the annualized rate of credit growth for the first five months 
of 1990 was 3 percent down from the 76 percent for all of 1989 
and 85 percent for 1988 
at the same time americans savings rate savings as a 
percentage of disposable income has been pegged above 6 percent 
for several months after dropping to a low of 32 percent for all 
of 1987 
gilbert benz an economist with swiss bank corp in new york 
said varying methods of computing economic statistics are used by 
different government agencies and occasionally produce different 
results 
the commerce departments retail sales reports which have 
fallen for three consecutive months dont include services such as 
health care and have a smaller survey sample than the feds 
consumer credit reports benz said 
benz also said that april borrowing was weak and that the may 
borrowing was somewhat of a payback 
consumers are not dying benz said perhaps theyre a 
little more cautious definitely slowing but by no means do we 
have a recession scenario 
automobile loans continued to decline in may but at a slower 
rate debt dropped 87 million a 04 percent rate of decline that 
compared with a net decline in automobile debt of 2 billion the 
previous month 
bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose 533 
million a 31 percent annual rate after a 4 percent annual growth 
rate in april 
borrowing for mobile homes increased 325 million a 172 
percent annual rate of growth after a 03 percent decline the 
previous month 
the various changes left total consumer debt at the end of may 
at 7247 billion

the lutheran bishop who filed charges 
against two churches for hiring homosexual ministers says he 
supports parishes led by gays and lesbians as long as the preachers 
do not engage in homosexual sex 
i found it necessary to file charges because the congregations 
had violated the churchs constitution on a very serious 
matter said lyle miller bishop of sierra pacific synod the 
regional judiciary branch of the evangelical lutheran church in 
america 
a 14member church discipline committee was set to begin 
deliberations tuesday after three days of meetings on whether to 
expel two san francisco churches st francis lutheran and first 
united lutheran for ordaining a gay man and a lesbian couple who 
refused to take vows of celibacy 
the panel is expected to issue a decision by july 17 
miller in 1989 refused to recommend jeff johnson an openly gay 
man for an ordained ministry because johnson would not vow 
abstinence from homosexual relations 
but the first united lutheran church hired johnson as an 
assistant pastor in 1989 two months later st francis lutheran 
ignored church guidelines and hired two lesbian pastors who also 
refused to pledge celibacy 
the evangelical lutheran church with 53 million members is 
the largest lutheran body in the united states like other 
mainstream churches it forbids ordination of sexually active 
homosexuals arguing that sex should only be practiced within 
marriage

outofpocket health expenses are taking the 
same size bite out of americans incomes as they were in the early 
1970s and even less than in 1960 according to a team of 
government researchers 
over the past three decades as health costs have climbed the 
government and employers have shared most of the increased costs 
the health care financing administration researchers reported 
private insurance has been providing more benefits largely 
because states are requiring more coverage but employers have been 
unsuccessful in shifting the costs of better coverage to workers 
said economist katharine r levit 
however she predicts that will change 
businesses are essentially being squeezed by medical costs 
on the employer side and by competition on the price side she 
said some reconciliation of the problem is going to have to 
occur 
but while many business leaders and some politicians have been 
calling for changes in the nations health care system we as 
individuals dont feel the pressure yet levit said and until 
we do we wont join the ranks of business and government in 
clamoring for changes 
in 1988 spending from all sources for health care in the united 
states was nearly 540 billion more than 11 percent of the gross 
national product that year levit and two colleagues reported in an 
article published in the summer issue of health affairs a 
quarterly journal on health policy 
the figures tallied by levit mark freeland and dan waldo are 
the latest comprehensive figures available they said 
national health expenditures have grown at an average annual 
rate of 11 percent over the past three decades and 104 percent 
from 1987 to 1988 
americans used about 5 percent of their aftertax income in 1988 
on health care expenses including their share of insurance 
premiums and outofpocket costs to meet deductibles and pay for 
medical care not covered by insurance 
this proportion is the same as in 197273 and lower than the 61 
percent of aftertax income used for health care expenses in 
196061 the researchers reported 
since 196465 health spending has grown from 42 percent of all 
federal expenditures to nearly 14 percent in 1987 levit said for 
state and local expenditures combined health spending has grown 
from 74 percent to 13 percent over the same period she said 
businesses have seen their share of health insurance premiums 
increase from 2 percent of total employer compensation in 1965 to 6 
percent in 1987 levit said

two women have agreed to divide the 10 
million estate of a husband they unknowingly shared for more almost 
three decades according to court documents 
the estate of harry glenn davis a calhoun county landowner 
included cash rental property and real estate in calhoun and 
talladega counties according to 1989 documents unsealed last week 
at the request of a local newspaper 
davis was married to ruth davis and flossie davis for 28 years 
but neither wife knew of the other until after his death in 1988 
ruth lived on the couples boiling springs farm near oxford in 
northeast alabama while flossie one of davis former tenants 
lived in tallahassee fla 
davis commuted between the two sites telling the women he spent 
weekdays handling his business interests in calhoun county and 
weekends gambling in new orleans according to their attorneys 
there were no children from the 51year marriage between davis 
and ruth flossie who was married to davis for 28 years had two 
children harry glenn davis jr and debbie anne davis 
when davis died at age 76 he apparently left only one heir 
ruth but a few months later flossie filed a 1969 will in which 
davis left most of the estate to her and their two children it 
provided 50000 and a monthly allowance to ruth 
ruths lawyers contested the 1969 will and contended that davis 
left the estate to ruth in a will written in 1959 prior to 
flossies 1960 marriage 
according to court records circuit judge harold quattlebaum 
said his opinion was that the marriage of flossie and davis was 
null and void because davis was legally married to ruth at the time 
of the second union 
but the women agreed to share the estate rather than risk 
getting nothing in the court battle 
neither received the amount they were seeking flossie had filed 
a claim for 10 million and each child sought 2 million ruth had 
filed a claim for 40 million 
in the settlement flossie was awarded 360000 in cash a 
165000 promissory note owed to davis by williamson oil co and 
real estate appraised at more than 600000 her children received 
20000 each 
ruth received the remainder of the estate including several 
thousand shares of stock two checking accounts which contained 
undisclosed amounts and property appraised at about 5 million

tens of thousands of ethnic 
albanians staged peaceful demonstrations and strikes throughout the 
troubled southern province of kosovo on monday to protest the 
nearabolition of kosovos autonomy 
in the provincial capital of pristina 150 miles south of 
belgrade batonwielding security forces dispersed a crowd of about 
1000 people 
but witnesses and the yugoslav news agency tanjug said the vast 
majority of employees of albanian origin left their jobs in 
staterun companies monday and peacefully paraded on the streets of 
kosovo towns 
hisen kajdomcaj president of kosovos collective state 
presidency and two other members of the body resigned monday to 
protest last weeks decision by serbias communist authorities to 
dissolve local governing bodies in kosovo

unconstitutional attack on the province 
kosovo is an administrative part of serbia the largest of 
yugoslavias six republics serbias move all but abolished the 
autonomy kosovo was granted under the 1974 federal constitution 
in reply kosovos ethnic albanian opposition groups organized 
the peaceful resistance protest 
the autonomy of the province is guaranteed by the 
constitution and cannot be jeopardized they said in a joint 
letter of resignation carried by tanjug they appealed to the 
leadership of this nation of more than 234 million people to 
undertake immediate measures to ensure the democratic settlement 
of the situation 
serbian authorities disbanded the local assembly and government 
after 114 ethnic albanian members of the assembly announced plans 
to declare kosovos full autonomy from serbia both dismantled 
bodies were dominated by ethnic albanians who make up 90 percent 
of the provinces 19 million people 
on monday heavy security forces patrolled the streets of

replaced albanianlanguage programs on pristina radio and 
television were taken off the air

have pressured serbs to move out of kosovo 
ethnic albanians deny it they want free elections and a 
multiparty system and say serbias communist leader slobodan

the nations longest and costliest criminal 
court proceeding went to a jury monday for a second time with a 
judge telling jurors to ignore public opinion in deciding charges 
against raymond buckey 
its been close to seven years of my life and now its come to 
a finale mcmartin two the summer rerun buckey told reporters 
outside court referring to the now defunct mcmartin preschool 
twelve more people will decide my fate 
buckey is charged with eight counts of molestation involving 
three young girls who once attended the manhattan beach preschool 
operated by his family 
buckey 32 is the only one of seven teachers accused of 
molesting children at the preschool still facing charges charges 
against five of the teachers were dismissed and his mother peggy 
mcmartin buckey was acquitted on all counts following the first 
trial 
at the first trial buckey was acquitted on 40 counts of 
sexually abusing children at the school jurors deadlocked on 13 
other charges against him however and prosecutors refiled on 
eight of those counts 
jurors began deliberations after superior court judge stanley 
weisberg delivered 30 minutes of instructions 
he addressed the issue of witness credibility focusing on how 
jurors should view the unique testimony of child witnesses 
you should not discount or distrust the testimony of a child 
or give it greater weight solely because the witness is a child 
weisberg said 
the retrial which lasted just three months followed a twoyear 
preliminary hearing and a nearly threeyear trial that was the 
nations longest court proceding and cost los angeles over 135 
million a record for a criminal trial 
buckey took the stand in both trials to deny he ever molested 
children 
both trials have been held in a highly charged atmosphere and 
weisberg told jurors they must not base their decision on public 
opinion about the notorious case 
you must base your decision on the facts and the law he 
said 
the retrial featured testimony from three young girls who said 
buckey molested them when they were students at the preschool 
the defense alleged the children were influenced by therapists 
who interviewed them in the early stages of the case and suggested 
their testimony was unreliable 
prosecutors said the children should be believed although they 
acknowledged that memories had faded over the years the children 
who were barely verbal when they attended the school are now 12and 
13yearsold prosecutors noted 
buckey was arrested nearly seven years ago and spent five years 
in jail before a judge released him on bail 
the defendant said outside court he has not decided what to do 
with the rest of his life 
for a long time i didnt want to deal with society i wanted 
to go away and become a hermit but now people come up to me and 
ask me how i got through this maybe i can help other people i 
dont know what ill do maybe grow christmas trees in oregon 
maybe give advice on how you survive a witch hunt 
the prosecutor deputy district attorney joseph martinez told 
reporters were confident that if the jury views the testimony 
of the children and considers the medical evidence and the 
testimony of the parents we feel the jury might convict you 
never know

the environmental protection agency outlined 
hazardous waste cleanup procedures and standards on monday that it 
said could cost private industry as much as 42 billion to carry 
out 
epa administrator william k reilly called the plan a 
pragmatic approach for correcting existing problems and said it 
will ensure to the extent practical prevention of releases that 
might threaten human health and the environment 
the proposed standards and procedures affecting a wide range of 
industries and federal facilities regulated under the resource 
conservation and recovery act will be published later this month 
in the federal register 
the public will have 60 days from publication date to comment on 
them public hearings have been scheduled in san francisco and 
washington dc in october 
epa said the new regulations would affect 3000 to 4000 
facilities including several hundred owned by the federal 
government 
the agency estimated it could cost privately owned facilities 
between 7 billion and 42 billion to meet the requirements the 
price tag for federal facilities would total 3 billion to 18 
billion epa said in a statement 
the scope of the work that needs to be done under this program 
underscores the value of preventing rather than having to clean 
up pollution reilly said 
the wide range of the cost estimates is due to markedly varied 
conditions from site to site involving uncertain levels of ground 
water monitoring and cleanup the agency said 
epa said its plan allows corrective actions to be tailored to 
sitespecific conditions and sets healthbased standards for the 
cleanup of pollutants the plan also contains requirements on how 
wastes must be stored treated or disposed of during cleanups 
remedies would have to be consistent with those required under the 
agencys superfund cleanup program 
industries affected would include petroleum refiners wood 
preservers metal finishers and auto manufacturers 
further information on the proposal can be obtained from epa by 
calling 18004249346

faced with a lessening soviet threat and fewer 
dollars for defense the pentagon could cut army and air force 
rosters by 120000 personnel by restricting reenlistments 
imposing early retirements and reducing promotions analysts said 
monday 
but a study by the congressional budget office found that the 
savings from an acrosstheboard approach would amount to only 900 
million from the 307 billion president bush has proposed in 
military spending in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
savings totaling 14 billion would occur if the services simply 
scaled back promotions a step that would be feasible only if the 
army and air force expect no additional activeduty personnel cuts 
beyond 1991 the cbo said 
this approach however would create a hole in the enlisted 
experience profile that is the distribution of personnel over 
years of service the study said 
the cbo also said that some loss of readiness is probably 
inevitable whenever significant personnel reductions are made 
slowing the pace of the drawdown might merely spread out its 
effects 
at the request of rep les aspin dwis and the chairman of the 
house armed services committee the cbo examined the options in 
reducing the two services by 120000 the navy and the marine corps 
were not included in the study 
the bush administration in its budget for fiscal 1991 has 
proposed cutting activeduty strength by 38000 about 80000 
troops would be withdrawn from europe under the administrations 
proposal in negotiations with the soviet union on reducing 
conventional forces 
hardest hit by the administrations cutbacks would be the army 
and air force the two services with the largest contingents 
overseas as of march 31 the army had 764259 activeduty 
personnel the air force has some 550000 
the analysis which makes no recommendations said the 
acrosstheboard approach would include reduced promotions 
restricting first second and third reenlistments selective early 
retirements and socalled involuntary separations of personnel 
with more than six years of service 
the approach to personnel reductions would avoid the hole in 
the enlisted experience profile the cbo said 
however the acrosstheboard approach would raise the thorny 
issue of involuntary separations or layoffs for some personnel 
with more than 10 years in the military 
these people would have their lives disrupted face at least 
temporary unemployment and lose the chance to receive the 
retirement benefits that may have been an important factor in their 
earlier decisions to reenlist the cbo said 
the analysis notes the three bills pending in congress that 
would provide severance pay for enlisted personnel who are 
involuntarily separated 
the proposed severance payments would offer fairer treatment 
than is available under current law which provides severance 
payments only for officer personnel the cbo said

the ageold question of why birds of a

produced flocks of simulated birds by plugging in a few numbers 
building on the work of others who have shown that in a branch of 
mathematics that deals with chaos there is order 
weve got something here that looks like a bird flock or a 
swarm of bees heppner said so we know we can produce that 
kind of behavior but were not sure why it works the way it does 
the implications are tremendous say those familiar with the 
field new ways to control swarms of planes around busy airports 
crowd control even simpler computer animation 
the beauty is that the complex behavior comes from some simple 
rules interacting with each other said christopher langton a 
mathematician with los alamos national laboratory in new mexico 
any minor change is magnified through the chain much like one bird 
swerving suddenly can divert the whole flock 
thats what chaos is all about he said 
heppner 49 who calls himself just a simple country scientist 
i like to work on things i can see spent about 15 years 
pursuing theories that flocks needed a leader before a computer 
game changed his thinking in 1987 
the game life uses a few simple rules to make squares 
interact on a screen heppner made up some rules and when he tried 
to generate patterns across the screen he realized this is a bird 
flock 
he concluded that it explained the actions of a flock of 
thousands of starlings for instance much better than looking for 
a bird leader 
he hooked up with grenander an amateur bird watcher and 
graduate student daniel f potter and they wrote equations and a 
computer program 
the simple rules were that birds like to be with each other but 
not too close they probably will try to keep up with each other 
and they will be attracted to something such as a roost 
then based on heppners reallife studies they plugged in 
numbers 
sometimes the little triangles representing birds would fly off 
their perch on a simulated wire and come together only to fly 
apart again other times they would come together but fly off the 
screen nine out of 10 times the birds didnt do anything 
heppner said 
but sometimes the numbers would work and the birds would swoop 
around the roost in complicated but cohesive patterns 
its very dramatic when you see it on the screen said 
heppner 
theres been a lot of serendipity with this he said 
were really at the stage of playing with it 
the current model looks down on the simulated birds next is to 
create a threedimensional model that can be viewed sideways 
heppner says the team then will compare it with videotapes of real 
flocks 
heppner said he has had calls from people studying bee swarms 
and from federal aviation administration researchers wondering if 
pilots given more information about other planes in their area 
might naturally slide into landing formation without as much 
intervention from controllers 
a researcher from a military thinktank even called to see if 
the teams work might help explain if soldiers without a leader 
could function as a unit 
what the birds would indicate is that yeah they probably 
could reach a pretty decent decision heppner said

japan have dined at bayou bend since it became a museum nearly a 
quartercentury ago 
sitting amid miss hoggs collection of antiques and art objects 
the summit leaders will dine on tortilla soup cornbread sticks 
grilled gulf red snapper sweet corn puree and onions lettuce and 
almond salad and american cheeses for dessert there will be 
blackberry peach swirl ice cream with sliced peaches and cookies 
miss hogg was a widely known texas philanthropist from a family

ten years after the film caligula was seized 
by city vice detectives the controversial photographs of robert 
mapplethorpe will arrive next month with the impassioned backing of 
the institute of contemporary art 
far from being banned in boston mapplethorpes work will 
receive extra security the director of the institute said monday 
to ensure that it is properly showcased in the city where 
mapplethorpe died of aids a year ago 
the exhibit will also receive corporate sponsorship for the 
first time on the tour from phoenix mediacommunications group 
despite threats of protest from a catholic lay group ica 
director david ross said the museum wouldnt omit the seven 
sexually graphic photographs in the exhibit the collection of 160 
photographs which includes still lifes portraits and nudes will 
be on exhibit from aug 1 to oct 4 
we promised him we would do what we could to make sure the 
exhibit was shown according to his wishes said ross robert 
mapplethorpe was a friend of mine and someone i knew for 15 years 
were showing this because we believe robert mapplethorpe was an 
important artist his work spoke to the tenor of our times as all 
good artists do 
to edit out the controversial works would be egregious ross 
said he was an artist whose career deserved an entire 
retrospective 
philip lawler of the catholic league for religious and civil 
rights said the art institute can count on some strong 
demonstration of outrage 
lawler and former boston mayor john collins have called on mayor 
raymond flynn to stop the exhibit flynn aides have said the mayor 
will not block the show 
caligula a sexually graphic 1980 film about ancient rome 
was the last casualty of the legendary censorship that led to the 
phrase banned in boston since the last century at least 16 
books have been banned in boston according to the american library 
association casualties included works by theodore dreiser ernest 
hemingway and elizabeth barrett browning 
controversy has trailed the mapplethorpe exhibit in its tour 
around the country last month an ohio judge ruled that an art 
gallery and its director must stand trial for displaying two 
mapplethorpe photographs that included nude or seminude children 
a county grand jury indicted the contemporary arts center in 
cincinnati and director dennis barrie on april 7 the day the 
exhibit opened 
ross called the cincinnati indictment a very sad event its 
not a good day for museum directors when theyre hauled off to 
court for doing what museum directors have been doing for years 
the boston show concludes an 18month tour that included stops 
in philadelphia chicago washington dc hartford conn

nasa officials said monday they still have not 
pinpointed the mysterious hydrogen leak that grounded the space 
shuttle fleet even though engineers repeated the leak in 
laboratory tests 
rockwell international engineers detected escaping hydrogen in a 
weekend test of hardware from space shuttle columbia but nasa 
space flight director william lenoir said engineers still dont 
know the precise valve pipe or seal in the complex plumbing of the 
liquid hydrogen rocket fuel system that is leaking 
the rockwell test in effect proved that the leak was related 
to the design or assembly of the equipment lenoir said the next 
step now is to find the exact source 
my biggest fear was that we would go through the downey test 
and get no leak at all said lenoir im encouraged 
finding no leak officials said would have made the leak even 
more puzzling and more difficult to repair 
space shuttle program director robert crippen cautioned that 
although the leak discovery is important we really do not know 
what the problem is yet we havent eliminated anything yet 
an even more important leak test is planned for friday or 
saturday on space shuttle atlantis which is on a launch pad at the 
kennedy space center in florida 
lenoir said the prime suspect for the source of the leak is 
a ushaped teflon seal that is supposed to keep hydrogen from 
leaking from what is called a disconnect this disconnect is in a 
17inch hydrogen pipe that pulls apart when the shuttle rocket 
propellant tank is jettisoned after launch 
rockwell engineers at the companys downey calif plant found 
the leak during weekend tests when liquid hydrogen was pumped 
through an apparatus of pipes seals and valves called an 
umbilical which had been removed from the shuttle columbia 
the umbilical carries rocket propellant from the shuttles large 
orange tank to the rocket engines in the orbiter the winged 
spacecraft that carries the astronauts the 17inch disconnect 
separates halves of the umbilical 
the umbilical also is used to load the fuel tank before launch 
the hydrogen leak on columbia was first detected in may when 
technicians were pumping the supercold hydrogen on board the 
mission was postponed and the umbilical on columbia was removed and 
sent to rockwell for testing 
a second hydrogen leak was found on atlantis last month as a 
precaution nasa grounded all three shuttles until the leaks are 
fixed 
the rockwell test was a laboratory experiment that did not 
exactly duplicate the conditions that occurred when columbias leak 
was detected said lenoir he said it was a static test that 
attempted to match the pressures and the minus 420 degree 
temperature of liquid hydrogen but it could not match the 84 
gallonaminute flow used when the tank is being filled 
the test late this week on atlantis will match all conditions of 
the earlier leaks lenoir and crippen said that atlantis umbilical 
is being outfitted with sensors and with plastic bags to capture 
and detect leaking hydrogen it is hoped that the test will help to 
isolated the source of the leak 
but crippen noted we have not eliminated the possibility that 
we might have two different problems on the two different 
vehicles 
liquid hydrogen is at minus 420 degrees when it is pumped into 
the shuttle fuel tank preflight tests of the umbilical had been 
conducted in the past using liquid nitrogen or helium both of 
which are warmer than liquid hydrogen the pipes and valves on 
columbia and atlantis had passed the nitrogen and helium tests 
it was only when the supercold hydrogen was pumped on board that 
the leaks occurred 
rockwell engineers used liquid hydrogen but nasa spokesman kyle 
herring said the rate of flow in the laboratory experiment is 
slower than what is used when the tank is being filled 
the shuttles main rocket engines burn liquid hydrogen and 
liquid oxygen the supercold chemicals are loaded into separate 
vessels inside the propellant tank the 153footlong tank attached 
to the belly of the orbiter during launch 
in houston meanwhile nasa said it was grounding two veteran 
shuttle crew commanders navy cmdr robert l hoot gibson and 
navy capt david m walker for violations of flight crew 
operations guidelines 
nasa said gibson was removed from shuttle flight assignments and 
from t38 jet trainer flight status for one year for violating a 
policy that restricts highrisk recreational activities for 
astronauts named to flight crews 
gibsons stunt plane collided saturday with another plane 
sending the second craft hurtling into a cornfield and killing its 
pilot henry w jones jr 69 a retired fighter pilot 
walker was suspended for a may 1989 incident in which the pilot 
of a pan am plane reported a near midair collision between his 
aircraft and a t38 flown by walker

using a rolled up dollar bill a tehranborn 
restaurateur demonstrated on the witness stand monday how he said 
mayor marion barry repeatedly snorted cocaine once only minutes 
before giving a speech 
hassan mohammadi said he furnished cocaine to barry about 30 
times once delivering more than 2 grams of the drug to the mayor 
in his office 
he wouldnt ask for cocaine but say whats happening are 
you loaded the witness said 
barry never paid mohammadi testified in fact he said on a 
november 1987 trip to the bahamas barry played blackjack using the 
30004000 worth of chips that mohammadi bought 
the mayor leaned back in his chair at the defense table 
sometimes smiling once grinning broadly during breaks in the 
proceedings he joked with his lawyers his campaign manager and his 
press secretary 
mohammadi who immigrated from iran in 1972 at the age of 18 
said he met barry at a district of columbia party during the 
democratic national convention in san francisco in 1984 he invited 
the mayor to the grand opening of pardis restaurant in the 
georgetown section of washington in february 1985 
the first time he saw barry ingest cocaine the witness said 
was on that occasion in an office atop the restaurant 
mohammadi said he barry and nightclub owner samad arshadi 
went upstairs where arshadi placed some powder on the table 
using a credit card arshadi made a line out of the powder 
and he and mr mayor snorted the substance through a rolledup 
bill said mohammadi 
he bent over the coke and he snorted mohammadi said of the 
mayor 
barry then licked his fingers to make them wet and began 
cleaning his nose with his fingers said mohammadi the mayor 
finished the cleaning by rubbing his fingers across the table top 
the businessman testified 
the men then went downstairs and barry made a speech to the 
guests at the packed restaurants grand opening said mohammadi 
then followed visits by the mayor to mohammadis apartment 
nearby in which mohammadi and barry snorted cocaine there was 
another occasion in a room at the capital hilton and a number of 
times in the cable beach hotel in the bahamas 
did you force the defendant to accept those quantities of 
cocaine from you asked assistant us attorney richard roberts 
not at all the witness said 
did anyone force the defendant to accept those quantities of 
cocaine 
no 
barry is charged with 10 counts of cocaine possession one count 
of conspiracy and three counts of lying to a federal grand jury 
about his alleged involvement with drugs 
throughout his testimony mohammadi referred to barry as mr 
mayor 
at roberts urging mohammadi demonstrated how barry allegedly 
rolled up a bill put his left finger to close off one nostril and 
inhaled through the bill with his right nostril 
at that point in mohammadis demonstration barry grinned 
broadly 
at the start of the afternoon session with the jury out of the 
room roberts said he intended to elicit testimony from mohammadi 
that he also saw barry use marijuana and opium on several occasions 
at one cookout said roberts there was use of cocaine and 
opium 
roberts said the proposed testimony was to show the 
defendants predisposition toward controlled substances to 
counter defense claims that barry was trapped into using cocaine on 
jan 18 when he was arrested 
mohammadi said that as part of his agreement with prosecutors to 
testify against barry the government promised to speak up for him 
in any deportation proceedings mohammadi has pleaded guilty to one 
count of conspiring with barry to possess cocaine 
earlier a prosecution witness testified that she smoked crack 
cocaine as recently as last month and had used drugs six days 
before she appeared before the grand jury that indicted the mayor 
in crossexamination lydia pearson stuck to her story that she 
had sold crack to the mayor 20 to 25 times in a three month period 
in 1988 delivering one shipment along with an application for a 
city job

a top state department official lodged a 
protest monday with the kenyan ambassador over the east african 
nations criticism of the united states 
herman cohen the assistant secretary of state for african 
affairs made the complaint in a meeting with kenyan ambassador 
denis afande amid continuing clashes in kenya between the 
government and prodemocracy protesters 
we protested the language they have been using against our 
ambassador said a state department official who spoke on the 
condition he remain anonymous the official said washington is 
concerned with statements by kenyan officials that somehow the 
united states is fueling the demonstrations 
we also made it clear that us ambassador smith hempstone 
has our full support the official said 
the meeting came as rep howard wolpe dmich chairman of the 
house africa subcommittee said he would press congress to freeze 
or cut us aid to kenya until that country improves its human 
rights record 
i am deeply disturbed by these developments wolpe said of 
the events in kenya they are clearly are not isolated 
incidents 
wolpe said he has directed his aides to come up with a strategy 
for halting millions of dollars in development and military 
assistance given to kenya 
wolpes comments came as us officials said they are helping 
gibson kumau kuria a human rights lawyer find a way to leave the 
country 
kuria 43 sought refuge in the us embassy in nairobi on 
saturday earlier kuria had been detained by the government of 
kenyan president daniel arap moi who has banned political 
pluralism in the oneparty state 
department spokesman richard boucher said kuria is the only 
activist who had taken refuge in the us embassy kuria has 
expressed a desire to leave kenya and we are assisting with 
necessary arrangements boucher said 
the kuria case came up in the meeting between cohen and the 
kenyan ambassador 
in nairobi meantime police used force to quell antigovernment 
protests that have spread from nairobi to other cities in the last 
three days eight people have been killed in rioting 
wolpe has long been concerned about human rights in kenya last 
month he joined reps dante fascell dfla chairman of the house 
foreign affairs committee and rep gus yatron dpa in asking 
moi to relax his clamps on political activists the lawmakers 
received no reply 
a congressional aide speaking on condition he remain anonymous 
said wolpe is seeking a consensus on how lawmakers want to handle 
aid to kenya many members are out of town for the july 4th recess 
one option is to freeze what is left in the unobligated accounts 
for fiscal yer 1990 the aide said washington has promised kenya 
35 million in development aid for the year all but 8 million has 
been sent the kenyans have also been promised 10 million in 
military aid 
another option is to cut money for the fiscal year beginning in 
october the house has passed a bill that includes about 33 
million in economic aid and 91 million in military aid that 
measure is pending in the senate 
congress would not touch money for the peace corps or food aid

mikhail s gorbachev has won another political 
victory gaining communist party approval to restructure the 
politburo that once ruled the country the politburo now promises 
to play second fiddle to the separate government structure he also 
leads 
the vote by the 28th communist party congress on monday also 
marks a new effort to reduce the ethnic unrest that is tearing the 
soviet union apart by including party leaders from the 15 soviet 
republics on the politburo the partys ruling inner circle 
the new body will have up to 23 members nearly twice the 12 
voting members on the old body and many if not most of the faces 
should be new 
the expansion and restructuring will accelerate the process that 
gorbachev began after he was elected to a strengthened presidency 
in march transferring power to a newly created presidential 
council a development that has angered such hardline politburo 
members as yegor k ligachev and could squeeze them out of their 
jobs 
unlike the politburo whose members are elected by the party 
members of the presidential council are appointed and dismissed by 
the president along the lines of a westernstyle cabinet 
the politburo which formerly met once every thursday has been 
meeting only once a month since march and has been concentrating 
on communist party rather than government issues 
since most of the politburo members will reside in their home 
republics the politburo will continue to meet relatively 
infrequently and will not exercise as tight control over national 
affairs as the body has traditionally done 
the duties of the government council have not been fully 
defined the 16man body consists of six voting members of the 
politburo including the prime minister defense minister foreign 
minister the kgb chief and gorbachevs righthand man alexander 
yakovlev other members are the chief law enforcement official a 
reformminded economist a crusading environmentalist and a 
workers rights activist 
significantly whereas nine of 12 men on the old politburo were 
members of the ethnic russian majority the new politburo will 
include a majority of nonrussians and the presidential council 
contains five nonrussians 
the new politburo will include the heads of the party 
organizations in the 15 republics most of whom are clamoring for 
greater control over political and economic decisions affecting 
their regions 
shortly after becoming general secretary of the communist party 
five years ago gorbachev sought to centralize his authority but 
he has been driven to support greater regional autonomy by the 
independence drives of the three baltic republics 
moreover the largest soviet republic the russian federation 
last month proclaimed its intent to seek greater control of its 
affairs under the leadership of its populist communist president 
boris n yeltsin 
mostly recently gorbachev has embraced the idea of 
reconstituting the soviet union as a looser confederation of 
republics 
the politburo has had its ups and downs since it was created on 
the eve of the 1917 bolshevik revolution that swept the communists 
to power the first two soviet leaders vladimir i lenin and josef 
v stalin exercised virtual one man rule appointing aides and 
allies to the politburo 
under leonid brezhnev who ruled for 18 years until his death in 
1982 the politburo was a coalition that made all the key decisions 
as brezhnev and the other politburo members weakened with age 
the country lapsed into what gorbachev has labeled the period of 
stagnation 
the first politburo consisted of seven bolsheviks among them 
lenin the founder of the red army leon trotsky and the 
lesserknown stalin 
following lenins death in 1924 stalin eliminated trotsky and 
other rivals from the ruling body by the height of his power in 
1952 he had expanded the membership to 25 voting members all 
loyal aides it also included 11 nonvoting members 
nikita s khrushchev who rose to power after stalins death in 
1953 whittled the body to 15 voting and nine nonvoting members 
although he instituted reforms he tried to keep a tight personal 
grip on power angering politburo colleagues who tried 
unsuccessfully to oust him in 1957 and succeeded in 1964 
brezhnev khrushchevs successor used the politburo to forge a 
coalition among soviet interest groups such as the armed forces 
the kgb other government ministries and major industrial sectors 
who held most of the dozen slots 
he also included seven heads of republic parties as nonvoting 
politburo members allowing them to run their regions in return for 
loyalty gorbachev and his allies argue that brezhnevs system led 
to widescale corruption and blocked the transformation of the 
country into a modern industrial society

appalachian trail hikers have been 
urged not to stop or stray along a 14mile stretch of the 
mainetogeorgia route because of a series of suspicious fires and 
booby traps 
forest service officials blame the incidents which include the 
stringing of fish hooks at eye and hiplevel across paths on a 
dispute between the government and landowners who fear their land 
will be seized to create a 500foot buffer along the trail 
the forest service has put up signs encouraging hikers not to 
stop or leave the trail in the buck mountain area between roan 
mountain and the north carolina state line forest service 
spokesman bill sweet said 
hikers have been scared by them and since we dont know what 
were dealing with thats a good thing said brian king public 
affairs director for the appalachian trail conference based at 
harpers ferry wva 
we havent had any problems there since late april king 
said monday no decision has been made on when the signs may be 
removed 
king said that in april a shelter on the trail was destroyed by 
fire authorities determined that someone had pulled brush into the 
shelter and ignited it suspicious brush fires also were reported 
in the area 
king said no injuries were reported 
sweet said no arrests have been made and none are expected 
theres no way to have a very effective investigation sweet 
said 
congress has mandated that the forest service acquire about 500 
feet on each side of the 2143mile trail 
but sweet said the forest service does not intend to take 
anyones land in the disputed area and is looking at an alternate 
route for that part of the trail in order to comply with federal 
law 
he said he believed that message had gotten through to 
landowners 
we dont think the trail hikers are in any danger sweet 
said we just dont want to encourage people to get off the 
trail for these 14 miles

police hunted monday for 
members of the white liberation army which claimed responsibility 
for a bombing that injured 27 blacks and threatened to carry out 
more such attacks to preserve white rule 
meanwhile four more white rightwing activists were arrested in 
connection with an investigation of a series of recent bomb attacks 
against opponents of the apartheid system according to police and 
news reports 
three of the men appeared briefly in the johannesburg 
magistrates court on monday in connection with the possession of 
weapons although they have not yet been charged with any crime 
so far 13 whites have been arrested in a police crackdown that 
began over the weekend against rightwing extremist groups 
suspected in the bombings 
the star newspaper reported monday that security police hunting 
rightwing groups had uncovered a huge cache of weapons and 
explosives 
the white liberation army took responsibility late sunday for 
fridays bombing of a black bus terminal in central johannesburg 
the bombing was one of at least six in johannesburg the past 10 
days 
the group calling itself the wit bevrydingsleer in afrikaans 
said in a fax to newspapers late sunday that it planted the bomb to 
protest government plans to end whiteminority rule it warned 
there would be more bombings 
the message was sprinkled with racist insults against blacks it 
called law and order minister adriaan vlok who heads the police a 
traitor 
a police official who declined to be named said the 
authorities had heard of the white liberation army before and were 
hunting for its members 
it is one of several extreme rightwing groups linked to violent 
attacks in recent weeks he said the bombing targets included an 
antiapartheid afrikaans newspaper a jewish synagogue and several 
liberal politicians 
police said sunday they had detained nine white men in 
connection with the recent bombings but no charges have been filed 
against them yet vlok said all were being held under the internal 
security act which allows for indefinite detention without trial 
the people arrested are all supporters of a far right 
political ideology but can not thus far be connected to any 
particular organization vlok said 
he said three prominent rightwingers were among those arrested 
identifying them as leonard veenendaal darryl stopforth and david 
rootenberg 
he said the other six arrested could not yet be named because of 
the delicate nature of the investigation 
vlok said the arrests quashed any suggestion that police were 
tardy in their investigation of rightwing extremists 
rightwing whites have expressed outrage at president fw de 
klerks plans to end apartheid and share power with the black 
majority 
both de klerk and the african national congress the leading 
black opposition group have acknowledged a terrorist campaign by 
heavily armed rightwing whites could undermine blackwhite 
negotiations 
the sunday times of johannesburg described rootenberg as a 
close friend of barend strydom who is on death row for killing 
seven blacks and an indian in a racially motivated shooting spree 
in pretoria in 1988 
eugene terreblanche leader of the rightwing afrikaner 
resistance movement said monday the arrests offered tragic 
proof that the government was yielding to the anc and the 
communists who play an influential role in the black nationalist 
groups leadership 
the government is recklessly busy intimidating rightwingers 
in order to impress its communist party allies so that they can go 
to the negotiation table as fast as possible he said 
he warned there would be greater actions of resistance and 
anger from whites if those arrested continue to be held without 
trial 
the african national congress had earlier criticized police for 
failing to solve any of the recent bombings but on monday the 
group said it appreciated the arrests 
walter sisulu the anc internal leader said the movement had 
demanded rightwing suspects be detained as anc suspects had been 
in the past 
sisulu said there was an essential difference between the 
bombings committed by the rightwing extremists and the armed 
struggle launched by the anc against the white minority government 
in 1961 
he said the ancs struggle was part of a human rights campaign 
on behalf of disenfranchised blacks while the whites already had 
the vote and extensive privileges 
they just have no reason to take up arms except to act as 
terrorists sisulu said 
most rightwing whites are afrikaners the dutchdescended 
settlers of south africa who account for 3 million of the 5 million 
whites

nasa on monday grounded two veteran 
shuttle crew commanders one involved in a fatal collision of stunt 
planes at a weekend air show and one accused of flying too close to 
an airliner 
navy cmdr robert l hoot gibson and navy capt david m 
walker were grounded for violations of johnson space center flight 
crew operations guidelines nasa said gibson was grounded for one 
year walker for 60 days 
this is the first time we have removed crew members from 
flights for disciplinary reasons said nasa spokesman jeff carr 
gibson 43 piloted an eightday challenger mission in 1984 and 
commanded the 1986 columbia mission and the december 1988 atlantis 
mission 
walker piloted a space shuttle flight in 1984 and was commander 
of the space shuttle atlantis during a fourday flight in may 1989 
nasa said gibson was removed from shuttle flight assignments and 
from t38 jet trainer flight status for one year for violating a 
policy that restricts highrisk recreational activities for 
astronauts named to flight crews 
gibsons stunt plane on saturday collided with another plane 
during a texas airshow the second craft hurtled into a cornfield 
and killed its pilot henry w jones jr 69 a retired fighter 
pilot from newport news va 
gibson landed his plane safely at the new braunfels municipal 
airport 25 miles northeast of san antonio 
donald r puddy director of flight crew operations said 
gibsons participation in the event was a clear violation of 
safety 
walker was scheduled to command a department of defense mission 
in march 1991 he was replaced on the flight and suspended from 
t38 flight status nasa said 
walker was suspended for a may 1989 incident in which the pilot 
of a pan am airbus 310 reported a near midair collision 
between his aircraft and a t38 jet flown by walker near 
washingtons dulles international airport 
a near collision is generally reported when two planes come 
within 500 feet of each other and either pilot feels the planes 
were in danger of colliding 
the federal aviation administration said air traffic controllers 
filed a pilot deviation report accusing walker of violating 
flight procedures it said the planes came within 100 feet 
vertically but that it was not clear how near the planes were at 
their closest point 
walker had descended to 7000 feet the assigned altitude of 
the pan am airliner when a controller ordered him to climb to 
8000 feet faa spokesman john leyden said at the time 
carr said the timing of the two groundings was an incredible 
coincidence 
the decision to ground walker was made a week ago but the 
announcement was delayed while authorities searched for a 
replacement for him on next years pentagon shuttle flight carr 
said 
walker had come up for disciplinary action review because of a 
number of aircraft operating infractions including the pan am 
incident carr said he refused to disclose any of the other 
infractions

homeless people activists and others who 
mourned the death of mitch snyder lined up in sweltering heat 
monday to pay last respects to the man who ended his own life after 
years of fighting for the downtrodden 
i always liked what he did said margaret moore a homeless 
woman who waited with others outside the shelter where snyders 
body lay i didnt know anything about homeless people until i 
became one i thought they all were bums but i listened to him 
and it helped me to learn that the homeless are people too 
the mourners waiting in temperatures that approached 100 
degrees stood in a line that snaked around the threestory shelter 
snyder had fought to win from the federal government inside his 
body lay in simple pine casket 
snyders longtime companion carol fennelly said she hoped the 
commitment of many activists would not fade with the death of the 
nations most visible advocate for the homeless 
i want people not to remember him and go on with their lives 
but remember him and do something to make a difference she said 
we cant ever bring him back or replace him but we can carry 
on 
members of the community for creative nonviolence the group 
snyder spoke for were also planning to keep pushing to help the 
destitute as they mourned snyders death 
he learned to love everybody but himself said ccnv 
volunteer ronald williams said its a story of human frailty 
and tragedy i guess 
the funeral was planned as the sort of gathering that snyder 
often organized to promote causes for the needy 
snyder will be cremated after a funeral tuesday that will 
include a march to city hall in which snyders body will be carried 
in a horsedrawn carriage said fennelly his remains will be kept 
at the shelter alongside those of homeless men and women who have 
died many anonymously on the streets of the nations capital 
fennelly spoke with reporters only on condition that she not be 
asked to discuss her relationship with snyder 
snyders body was found hanging from an electrical cord last 
thursday near a note that police said contained suicidal 
references law enforcement sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the note referred to problems he was having in his 
relationship with fennelly the two had known each other for 13 
years and had planned a september wedding 
all i am willing to say right now is that he was very tired 
fennelly said its such a personal tragedy 
she called snyders life of commitment a magical moment in 
time 
jesse jackson mayor marion barry actor martin sheen and the 
rev philip berrigan were scheduled to speak 
sheen portrayed snyder in a madefortelevision film about 
snyders battles on behalf of the homeless snyder credited 
berrigan and his brother daniel who is also a roman catholic 
priest with helping him turn his life around

the alaska legislature has adjourned its 
twoweek special session after failing to agree on a way to end a 
federal takeover of game management on twothirds of the states 
land 
the house which agreed only that something needed to be done 
ended up doing nothing by sundays adjournment after the senate 
had approved a constitutional amendment in the sessions first week 
the problem arose when the alaska supreme court in december 
declared unconstitutional part of a state law that gave rural 
alaskans preferential rights to subsistence hunting and fishing 
the court said the law discriminated against urban hunters and 
fishermen an estimated 110000 alaskans venture into the wild to 
hunt fish and gather plants for food 
that ruling put the state at odds with a fderal law that 
requires a rural preference on federal lands in alaska because of 
the discrepancy five federal agencies took over game management 
from the state on federal lands july 1 management of fisheries 
remained under state control 
gov steve cowper and the democratic majority were unable to get 
enough votes in the house for any of several amendments they 
proposed to restore the subsistence preference for rural residents 
democrat cowper twothirds of the republicanled senate 
alaskas allrepublican congressional delegation the states two 
largest newspapers and its largest native groups supported a 
constitutional amendment 
but the 16member republican minority in the house remained 
solidly against amending the constitution contending that would 
weaken the documents equalrights guarantee the minority said the 
state instead should challenge the federal law in court 
a twothirds majority 27 votes in the house was needed to 
refer an amendment to voters in november the most votes any of the 
amendments attracted was 23 
minority leader robin taylor rwrangell said the defeat of the 
amendments was his proudest moment in six years in the 
legislature what we have done is we have protected the bill of 
rights so that equality still exists among alaska citizens 
taylor said 
some of his fellow republicans did not share taylors pride 
federal intervention in the management of alaska game is a 
serious affront to the state senate president tim kelly said 
the legislature had it acted could have avoided it i think 
its going to be much tougher to regain control with the more time 
that goes by 
julie kitka president of the alaska federation of natives said 
the lack of action was a setback for the state 
a number of native people in villages will see this as a 
failure of the state system to respond to real needs of people and 
to let people decide their own destinies and future she said

a federal judge told attorneys monday he doubted 
he would take action in a lawsuit challenging georgias 
majorityrule vote before next weeks state primary elections 
us district judge richard c freeman addressed the timeliness 
of the suit at the end of the first day of testimony in the case 
david walbert an attorney representing the state had asked 
freeman if tuesdays session could start a few hours later than 
scheduled freeman responded the longer we wait the harder it 
will be to get this done i dont think it will be done anyway 
to be perfectly frank 
freeman noted that the lawsuit challenging the majorityvote 
requirement was filed in may though a motion asking him to stop 
the use of the requirement in the july 17 primary was filed only 
last week at the last minute 
the lawsuit filed by a group of black officials contends that 
the 1964 majority vote law which requires a runoff when one 
candidate fails to win a majority effectively keeps blacks out of 
public office 
the lawsuit seeks to replace the current system with a plurality 
method which would give the election to the candidate who wins the 
most votes 
the plaintiffs say the majorityvote requirement hurts black 
candidates because it is difficult for them to win more than 50 
percent of the vote in a state that is about threequarters white 
freeman did not indicate if he was leaning toward either side in 
deciding the suit 
laughlin mcdonald an american civil liberties union attorney 
representing the plaintiffs said filing the suit before the 
election gives the plaintiffs the option if the judge rules 
against them of maintaining their objections to the election 
results and seeking to have them changed afterward 
the first witness in the case was a political scientist from the 
california institute of technology who testified there were 
numerous indications that the georgia legislature had racial 
motivations in enacting the majorityvote law 
j morgan kousser a professor of history and social science and 
the author of a book on southern politics said state rep denmark 
groover pushed the majorityvote law through the legislature after 
national civil rights legislation led to the abolition of the 
states county unit election system that system resembling the 
electoral college system of choosing presidents awarded one to 
three units to a candidate for each county he carried 
kousser said groover was at the time an avowed segregationist 
groover who lost his legislative seat in 1958 to a moderate 
white candidate with considerable black support had publicly 
complained about black block voting according to kousser 
groover returned to the legislature in 1962 in 1984 kousser 
said groover admitted that in the early 1960s i was a 
segregationist i had my prejudices and i dont mind admitting 
it 
mcdonald said he does not plan to call groover as a witness 
kousser said there were other signs that lawmakers in 1964 
wanted to keep blacks out of public office including an attempt to 
stiffen the literacy test for voter registration

assistance to the african national congress during the 27 years he 
spent in prison for his antiapartheid activities

africas black majority

africa he declared praising the help provided by the oau in 
bringing the black majority to power in zimbabwe and namibia

a woman who police said craved 
attention held seven people hostage in a bank monday claiming she 
was armed with a hand grenade and gun during a fourhour standoff 
the hostages escaped at about 4 pm after a police swat team 
distracted the woman identified as 37yearold vicki molina 
she was arrested and no explosives or weapons were found police 
said 
when the negotiators and these tactical people started to move 
in she became distracted said metrodade police spokesman 
william kinnebrew most of the hostages ran toward the tactical 
people they got them out to safety and then were able to go in and 
subdue this woman and take her into custody 
no shots were fired and no one was injured ms molina was 
charged with nine counts of false imprisonment and jailed under a 
suicide watch said police lt nancy mccue

handed an employee a note then ordered an undetermined number of 
people to leave the bank said metrodade officer ralph hernandez 
she said she wanted attention said mccue 
the woman allowed several calls to be made by hostages 
including one to north miami police informing them she did not 
intend to rob the bank she said 
ms molinas husband told police she has been in and out of 
psychiatric treatment for 15 years she was chainsmoking and kept 
her hand in her purse during much of the standoff at one point

apparently she was trying to prove a point to someone mccue 
said we dont know who at this time 
the woman said that before entering the bank she had taken 
care of everything including giving away her dog said mccue

israels second experimental satellite 
disintegrated on reentry into the earths atmosphere on monday 97 
days after it was launched officials said 
the 352pound ofek2 satellite was launched april 3 amid 
speculation it was part of a program to spy on israels arab 
enemies 
israeli leaders denied this was the purpose but also bragged the 
launch showed israels scientific and military superiority over 
arab states 
ofek2 was launched a day after iraqi president saddam hussein 
threatened to react to any israeli assault on his country with a 
chemical attack that would destroy half the jewish state 
the satellites orbit ranged from 130 miles at its lowest point 
to 923 miles at its highest according to a statement from israel 
aircraft industries which developed the satellite 
it did not say where the reentry occurred 
ofek2 hebrew for horizon2 stayed in orbit about 40 days 
longer than expected due to the large reduction in the actual 
solar activity compared to the forecast the statement said 
it termed the flight an unqualified success 
ofek1 was launched on sept 19 1988 and stayed in space 115 
days israeli officals had said ofek2 would not stay in space as 
long as its predecessor 
ofek2 was more advanced because it was capable of twoway 
communication with its earth base scientists said 
according to official reports israel is expected to launch a 
third test satellite in 1992 and eventually put in orbit a 
communications satellite with 10year lifespan israeli scientists 
have developed a prototype of a communications satellite called the

an arkansas abortion rights group 
offered monday to arrange car pools for louisiana women seeking 
abortions should the restrictive bill passed by that states 
legislature become law 
should the legislation in louisiana be signed into law we 
will be available to assist them whether its caravans or 
whatever said kimberly collins chairwoman of the committee for 
reproductive choice we will certainly find a way to help those 
women 
she said the group also would buy advertising space in 
newspapers promoting the availability of abortions in arkansas 
louisiana lawmakers sunday passed a measure that would ban most 
abortions and punish doctors who perform them with up to 10 years 
at hard labor 
the law includes provisions demanded by gov buddy roemer to 
exempt most victims of rape and incest but he said wont act on it 
until he had read the bill carefully 
abortions are legal in arkansas although a constitutional 
amendment narrowly approved in 1988 makes it illegal to spend 
public funds on abortions except to save the mothers life that 
amendment also makes the protection of unborn children state policy 
a 1989 law requires women under the age of 18 to notify both 
parents should they seek an abortion minors can avoid notification 
of their parents if they convince a probate judge they have good 
reason to get the abortion without notifying their parents

dapper dressing may help you get ahead 
but a necktie tied too tightly can make your head swim and blur 
vision says the author of a book on improving health habits 
viselike ties can constrict blood flow to the brain and sensory

preventive medicine 
he cited 1989 research at cornell university for the necktie 
tip one of 365 suggestions in his book a year of health hints 
it can be a problem for people who have to use their eyes in 
an important way powell said monday noting that computer 
operators pilots and surgeons depend on clear vision 
powell suggested buying shirts a halfsize bigger in the neck 
leaving the top button undone tying knots loosely and loosening 
the tie throughout the day 
he also said casual days at work when a tie isnt 
necessary would help alleviate the problem and boost morale he 
said the institute has casual mondays and casual weeks and 
is discussing casual summers 
not having to put on a necktie and a suit seemed to improve

years ago but they must have looked at the name and thought it was 
a duplicate picture the only one that got printed was frank and 
nellas said trudy bouma 
after frank and trudy returned from their honeymoon they read 
in the newspaper that the other frank william bouma had fathered a 
child 
we hoped people didnt get the wrong impression from that 
trudy said we werent married nearly long enough to have a 
baby 
the next year frank and trudy had a daughter whom they named 
marcia they did not learn until much later that frank and nella 
also have a daughter named marcia 
the uncanny name game not only goes forward a generation but 
back one the two franks fathers are both named fred

with a 21gun salute a flourish of trumpets and 
a steady flow of highpowered airconditioning president bush 
formally opened monday what he dubbed the first postpostwar 
economic summit 
after a weekend of rodeo and downhome texas hospitality bush 
welcomed the other foreign leaders on the picturebook campus of 
rice university where the academic quadrangle proved a good staging 
ground for a fulldress military welcome 
but a lot of people were thinking at least as much about the 
weather temperatures in the mid90s and humidity topping 80 
percent 
with the heat in mind the welcoming ceremony was held to 10 
minutes from the time the leaders stepped into the quadrangle 
until they retreated inside lovett hall 
and in an effort to make even those few minutes more bearable 
the outdoor reviewing stand they stood on had a threeton air 
conditioner spewing cold air up from vents at their feet a white 
canopy overhead also shielded the leaders from the broiling sun 
offstage the sweat poured off the faces of less fortunate 
summit aides and the military color guard 
bush the transplanted new englander who now calls houston his 
hometown said we think this city is a very appropriate place to 
host this economic summit as cold war tensions continue to 
recede he called the gathering the first not of the postwar era 
but of the postpostwar era 
a new world of freedom lays before us bush told the leaders 
of great britain france west germany italy japan and canada 
before they went inside to begin their deliberations in private 
bush urged his fellow presidents and prime ministers to work 
toward decisions here in houston that will bring new stability and 
prosperity to the world 
the president and his wife barbara personally greeted each 
leader upon arrival on the campus after meeting each motorcade 
they waited inside before venturing out again in the heat 
british prime minister margaret thatcher who had to walk 
gingerly amid the dirt and hay at sunday nights rodeo was 
overheard telling her host last night was fabulous 
the leaders finished their first round of talks early and 
emerging back out in the heat walked down a long red carpet to 
pose for their traditional class photo 
we had very good discussions said bush who playfully waved 
behind his back to photographers as the leaders turned to walk away 
later they were reassembling to talk politics over a working 
dinner at the bayou bend a mansionturnedmuseum where the summit 
fare included tortilla soup grilled red snapper and blackberry 
peach swirl ice cream 
bush began his day in separate talks with french president 
francois mitterrand and west german chancellor helmut kohl who are 
leading the push against bushs resistance for direct western aid 
to bolster the staggering soviet economy 
bush met first with mitterrand to give kohl a little more time 
to rest from his long overnight flight to houston from the world 
cup finals in rome where kohl witnessed west germanys triumph 
over argentina on sunday 
mitterrand also flew in early monday morning but his was a less 
timeconsuming trip aboard the supersonic concorde 
bush and mitterrand both resisted reporters efforts to draw 
them out on the potential squabble over soviet aid im defending 
his right not to take questions at photo opportunities said bush 
as soon as mitterrand left the houstonian hotel after his 
meeting with bush the french tricolor flag was replaced on the 
wall of the houstonians manor house with the blackredandgold 
banner of west germany in readiness for kohls arrival 
bush greeted the chancellor with a jaunty thumbsup saying 
willkommen hail the champions of football world champions 
its a big win for germany 
inside bush boasted that he had played soccer himself on a 
championship team at yale in the 1940s and kohl said bush would 
get to inaugurate the next world cup games which will be played in 
the united states in 1994 
either as an unemployed person or as president bush quipped

the first of more than 5000 
albanians who rushed foreign embassies in tirana in a desperate bid 
to emigrate arrived in prague early tuesday aboard the personal 
plane of czechoslovak president vaclav havel 
in the albanian capital a un envoy was trying to negotiate 
safe passage abroad for the thousands stranded in their flight from 
europes last bastion of hardline communism 
havel sent his sovietbuilt tu154 to tirana and it arrived back 
at about 115 am carrying 51 albanians who sought asylum in the 
czechoslovak embassy 
the beaming occupants all adults yelled long live havel 
before being whisked away on buses to dormitories in an outlying 
district of prague 
foreign minister jiri dienstbier told reporters at the capitals 
airport that czechoslovakia got the refugees out first due to a 
little luck and a lot of patience 
he said most of the group wanted to emigrate to the united 
states but that in any event were not going to send them 
back 
in a brief dispatch albanias state ata news agency had 
announced that the group left shortly before midnight monday 
ata said a group of albanian citizens sheltering in the 
czechoslovak embassy left for prague with regular documents 
although albanian authorities agreed saturday to permit all the 
albanian asylumseekers to leave under foreign supervision the 
process of providing them with travel documents and transportation 
was expected to take days 
albanian authorities continued on monday to refuse aid shipments 
for the wouldbeemigres packed in western embassies 
the austria press agency reported from tirana that 25 tons of 
supplies destined for the west german and french embassies were 
flown out on the same swissair plane they came on because 
authorities did not permit unloading 
about 3000 albanians seeking asylum were jammed behind the 
gates of the west german embassy 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher promised that those 
albanians wishing to come to germany will be welcomed the 
ministry said in bonn 
about 1000 albanians were in the italian embassy 
the refugees overwhelmed the missions which have been unable to 
provide sufficient food and water sanitary conditions were bad 
genscher termed the situation intolerable 
one refugee gave birth to a girl in the west german compound 
over the weekend the germans said 
the shaken albanian leadership announced more government changes 
on monday an apparent attempt to reduce public dissatisfaction 
over shortages of food and other consumer items in that nation of 
32 million people 
the albanian parliament fired jovan bardhi the minister in 
charge of food production and vita kapo minister of light 
industry and reassigned ministers of public services and home 
trade ata reported 
the changes followed the replacement of the minister of police 
and the minister of war on sunday 
ata also announced wage reforms that will result in more wage 
differentiation and said unemployment benefits would be paid to 
workers idled through no fault of their own 
many of the more than 5000 albanians crowding foreign embassies 
have said they seek a better economic life abroad 
a spokesman at the foreign ministry in budapest gyoergy lukacs 
said six of the 40 albanians at the hungarian embassy expressed a 
desire to settle in hungary most wanted to go to the united 
states he said 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said 
he had no information about requests to travel to the united states 
and no comment on what us policy would be toward such requests 
there is no us embassy in tirana 
in paris the foreign ministry said the formalities of obtaining 
passports for the 550 refugees at its embassy in tirana were moving 
along rapidly and we hope they will be finished by the end of 
the day 
the asylumseekers some dodging police bullets began taking 
refuge on june 28 albanian authorities pledged saturday that those 
seeking to emigrate would receive travel papers 
hanns schumacher spokesman for the west german foreign 
ministry said in bonn that a un envoy was representing the west 
german italian french and greek embassies in talks with the 
albanian government 
about 30 albanians were in the greek embassy 
albanias communist leader ramiz alia has begun this year to 
institute some cautious economic reforms in an attempt to alleviate 
shortages and raise the standard of living by creating incentives 
for workers and farmers 
for 45 years travel for average albanians has been virtually 
impossible but since the death of president enver hoxha in 1985 
albanian leaders have sought better ties abroad and in the last 
year began to implement reforms albania this year has been seeking 
better relations with the outside world 
new regulations that took effect tuesday entitled all albanians 
over age 16 to own a passport 
police sealed off tiranas embassy row on sunday to prevent more 
albanians from taking refuge but some appeared to be getting 
through 
in warsaw the polish foreign ministry reported 51 albanians at 
its embassy compared to 46 sunday

lawyers for a man accused of killing 
seven people in a 1988 shooting rampage at a sunnyvale defense 
company moved monday to block prosecutors from seeking the death 
penalty 
it was the first day of trial for richard farley who faces 
seven counts of firstdegree murder and three counts of attempted 
murder stemming from the february 1988 massacre at esl inc 
farley is accused of entering the sunnyvale office draped with 
guns and ammunition and going on a shooting spree because a 
coworker engineer laura black had refused a date with him 
public defender gregory paraskou argued that the refusal of the 
us government and esl inc to turn over information on farleys 
work history would hurt the defense and jeopardize the penalty 
phase of the upcoming trial if farley is convicted 
prosecutor alan nudleman argued that the defense already had 
been given voluminous amounts of information on farleys work 
santa clara county superior judge joseph biafore issued a gag 
order that bars lawyers from discussing the trial with news 
reporters 
biafore also said he would take paraskous arguments under 
submission and review the documents in question before issuing a 
ruling 
farley allegedly told police negotiators he only wounded black 
so she would survive and regret what she had done black had 
obtained a court order against farley because she said he had been 
constantly bothering her 
farley surrendered at the shooting scene after long telephone 
negotiations with police

standing apart from its summit partners the bush 
administration on monday renewed its opposition to any concrete 
guide for reducing pollutants blamed for warming the earths 
atmosphere 
shortly before the sevennation summit formally opened white 
house hief of staff john sununu reiterated american worries that 
efforts to sharply curtail polluting emissions would hamper 
economic growth 
the administration is concerned that it is being asked for in 
essence a perpetual stabilization in energy use sununu said at a 
news conference 
continued economic growth requires that you continue to 
use energy and that any growth at all then would not be 
permitted he said 
a discussion of environmental issues was on the agenda for the 
summit meeting of president bush and the leaders of britain 
canada france west germany italy and japan 
at the end of their talks wednesday the leaders will release a 
final statement expected to include endorsement of a 93nation 
accord that in turn calls for getting rid of chlorofluorocarbons 
which deplete the earths protective ozone layer by the end of the 
decade 
the united states though has been isolated from its european 
allies in a goslow policy on curbing carbon dioxide and other 
pollutants blamed for warming the global environment 
several european countries intend to reduce or stabilize carbon 
dioxide emissions by the year 2000 or 2005 but bush argues more 
research needs to be carried out before such dramatic measures are 
adopted 
west german chancellor helmut kohl in an opening statement to 
his counterparts said a lack of scientific knowledge about the 
causes and effect cannot justify slowing down the taking of 
concrete measures 
he said decisive steps must be taken to reduce the greenhouse 
effect and urged immediate action to stop the destruction of rain 
forests 
the houston summit he said should give a clear and 
concrete signal for the effective protection of mankind and 
environment 
in advance of the summit officials said the europeans appeared 
willing to ease their previous insistence that specific reduction 
goals be set at the summit led by germany some had wanted 
agreement to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions or reduce them by 
up to 25 percent by the end of the decade 
sununu in an interview on abc took a swipe at the united 
states critics on the other side of the atlantic 
i think west germany got a lot of good grades for rhetoric 
he said 
if you take a good look at what the united states has actually 
done in terms of cleaning up our environment i dont think the 
united states has to take a back seat to anyone he said 
but the wilderness society a private american environmental 
group shot back the us gets a failing grade no matter how 
sununu tries to rejigger the numbers 
on sunday environmentalists denounced what they said was the 
failure of the summit nations to meet the aims of last years paris 
summit during which they promised to protect the worlds 
environment 
sununu told reporters the united states wanted a commitment 
that would allow both the industrialized countries and the 
developing countries to address the broad issue of greenhouse gases 
without picking them one by one and setting caps on them 
individually 
what we have proposed constantly is to address them in the 
broad context and let each country take into account its own 
particular structure he said 
in addition to global warming summit participants are expected 
to discuss ways to curtail the destruction of tropical forests and 
whether to create an international green fund to help 
developing countries protect their environments 
kohl told bush he wanted the summit to support help for brazil 
in its fight to save its rain forests from destruction said 
spokesman hans klein kohl and bush met privately monday morning 
before the summit began 
environmentalists from eastern europe appealed to the summit 
leaders at a news conference monday to help their countries clean 
up 
in the past money was pumped into the government without 
economic or environmental concern said zbigniew bochniarz a 
member of the polish ecology club now we must create a new 
approach and build conditions that will modernize outdated 
pollution standards

leaders of the six east african 
nations on monday signed an unprecedented peace pact to end 
conflicts in their region 
the signing followed urgings by president mengistu haile mariam 
of embattled ethiopia that the african heads of state follow the 
lead of superpowers and try to defuse confrontations through 
negotiations 
the pact committed djibouti ethiopia kenya somalia sudan and 
uganda to seek peaceful means to end regional conflicts 
peoples and governments in various parts of the world which 
had been locked in antagonism are now making efforts to resolve 
their differences through peaceful negotiations mengistu said 
with the phasing out of the cold war the peoples of the world 
have begun to breathe the air of peace 
mengistus government is engaged in what he has termed life 
and death struggles with two separate insurgencies in eritrea and 
tigre provinces 
sudan somalia and uganda are trying to contain longrunning 
insurgencies and the six nations that signed the pact have at one 
time or other accused each other of harboring and aiding their 
opponents 
the accord was signed by mengistu presidents hassan gouled 
aptidon of djibouti daniel arap moi of kenya maj gen omar 
hassan el bashir of sudan and yoweri museveni of uganda and by 
somalia prime minister ali samantar 
the six met hours before the opening of the 26th annual summit 
of the heads of state of the 51member organization of african 
unity in the ethiopian capital 
the oau summit is expected to focus on issues ranging from 
mounting popular calls for multiparty democracy to the mountains of 
foreign debt 
mengistus government held fruitless peace talks late last year 
with ethiopias two guerrilla groups each of which has intensified 
its efforts to topple him 
one group has been fighting 29 years seeking independence for 
ethiopias northernmost province eritrea and mengistu has not 
softened his objection to the secession 
he did not mention his troubles at home but observed that 
unification had become a current byword with mergers of the two 
yemens and east and west germany 
furthermore the countries of western europe through the 
european community are taking historic steps towards integration 
and by developing closer ties in all fields with east european 
countries are moving toward making europe for the first time in 
its history a continent of peace and cooperation mengistu 
declared

charged with the bloody slayings of his wife two daughters and 
four other people lost a bid monday for a twomonth delay of his

the trial until september but after a 40minute private discussion 
with lawyers superior court judge reginald littrell said jury 
selection would start next monday 
salcido 29 is accused of murdering his wife two of their 
three daughters two of his wifes sisters his motherinlaw and a 
coworker 15 months ago in the wine country of sonoma county north 
of san francisco 
miller had said he also planned to ask for a second change of 
venue but did not make a formal request monday the trial was 
moved to san mateo county south of san francisco because of heavy 
news coverage 
miller and the prosecutors agreed on a list of 97 questions for 
potential jurors many deal with the jurors frame of mind 
regarding the death penalty the expected focus of the salcido 
trial 
jury selection is expected to take at least six weeks with 500 
prospective jurors called for possible selection 
miller said he plans to agree to most of the evidence against 
his client who submitted a full confession to police but said he 
would fight the death penalty 
i want to keep my client alive miller said outside the 
courtroom 
miller and prosecutor peter bumerts clashed repeatedly in court 
at one point miller stood jabbing the air as he argued for a 
delay in the trial 
a mans life is at stake he pleaded 
if mr salcido had had the same consideration for the seven 
people he killed maybe we wouldnt be here countered bumerts 
authorities say salcido began his murderous rampage after a 
night of drugs and drinking because he thought his wife angela 
was unfaithful and that he was not the father of the couples 
eldest daughter 
contributing to his anger they believe was a court order to 
make back childsupport payments to his first wife a woman angela 
was not aware of until the order arrived at their home salcido has 
a daughter by his first wife 
salcido was arrested in his native mexico a few days after the 
slayings sonoma county sheriffs detectives said he confessed on 
the return trip to california

rampage 
he took daughters theresa 1 sofia 4 and carmina 3 to the 
county dump and cut their throats carmina alone survived then 
salcido drove to his inlaws house where he knocked out and 
stabbed to death his motherinlaw marion louise richards and cut 
the throats of her daughters 12yearold ruth and 8yearold marie 
salcido returned home beat his wife and shot her with a 
22caliber pistol he next drove to the grand cru winery where he 
worked and shot and killed coworker tracey toovey 35 then he 
shot and wounded a second coworker ken butti 33 at buttis home 
salcido was charged with seven counts of murder and three counts 
of attempted murder one of the attempted murder counts stems from 
his allegedly pointing a gun at buttis wife terri 
miller has said he will argue that his client had an organic 
brain dysfunction and was suffering from psychotic depression 
at the time of the slayings

a roman catholic church official 
assailed president fernando collor de mello on monday saying he 
failed to halt the destruction of the yanomani indians one of the 
worlds largest remaining primitive tribes 
the yanomani genocide and violence against indigenous peoples 
continues said antonio brand secretary of the catholic 
churchs official indian council the indians are tired of 
declarations that dont bring change 
collor who took office in march has vowed to defend indian 
rights in april he ordered the destruction of clandestine landing 
strips on yanomani lands that are used by amazon gold miners 
the yanomani live on brazils northwest frontier with venezuela 
thousands of miners invaded their territory after large reserves of 
gold diamonds and other minerals were found there in 1987 
brand dismissed the dynamiting of the landing strips as a 
publicity stunt 
only 14 of over 100 strips were destroyed and the majority 
have already been recovered by the miners he said 
brand said the churchs indian council wants the government to 
remove all gold miners from the region and revoke decrees issued by 
former president jose sarneys government which created mining 
reserves on yanomani territory 
the negligence of collors government in the face of this 
problem makes it coresponsible for the yanomani genocide he 
said 
he said the yanomanis situation was rapidly worsening and 
medical care and food supplies were desperately needed 
miners have disrupted the yanomanis hunting and fishing 
polluted rivers with mercury used to clean gold and brought 
diseases previously unknown to the indians 
many tribes have been hard hit by malnutrition venereal 
diseases and malaria introduced by the outsiders other 
tribespeople have died in clashes with miners 
brand said 15 percent of the yanomani population estimated at 
9000 has disappeared in less than three years

the leader of a procuban guerrilla group and 
at least 39 other suspected leftist rebels escaped early monday 
from a maximumsecurity prison by crawling through a 660foot 
tunnel officials said 
corrections department director victor miranda identified victor 
polay head of the tupac amaru revolutionary movement or mrta as 
among those who escaped the miguel castro prison on the 
northeastern outskirts of this capital 
miranda said 39 male and nine female members of mrta fled while 
president alan garcia said 40 rebels escaped the different figures 
could not immediately be reconciled 
the breakout occurred about 3 am in a facility that is 
considered the countrys highest security prison and houses 
hundreds of suspected communist rebels 
government prosecutor maria astete said police found two 
submachine guns a walkietalkie and four boobytrap bombs in the 
blockandahalflong tunnel 
ms astete also said five hooded gunmen held up a bank at midday 
in a northern suburb killing a guard and making off with 
45000000 peruvian intis about 450 she said police believed the 
five to be among the escapees 
police captured polay on feb 3 1989 in the highland city of 
huancayo 120 miles east of lima his capture was considered a 
serious blow to the procuban mrta which began fighting perus 
elected government in 1984 
the shining path group that operates primarily in the peruvian 
highlands is considered the largest and most dangerous of the two 
antigovernment organizations fighting president garcia 
polay 38 was facing terrorism charges and was to be sentenced 
within weeks after a highly publicized trial the government 
prosecutor was recommending a 15year sentence 
before taking up arms polay was a student leader of the 
centerleft aprista party in the late 1960s he studied with 
garcia current leader of the aprista party in spain in the early 
1970s 
the mrta is believed to number about 1000 combatants and 
operates mostly in perus northern and eastern jungles it also 
carries out occasional bombings against banks embassies and 
government buildings in the capital 
its most spectacular action to date was the assassination in 
january of former defense minister gen enrique lopez lopez was 
gunned down in broad daylight by three men near his office in a 
fashionable lima suburb 
speaking to reporters garcia blamed the prison guards who he 
said shared responsibility for the breakout 
garcia said that despite the dramatic escape the guerrillas were 
losing their fight against the government 
i reiterate that terrorism in peru is in retreat garcia 
said they have had 10 years and have not achieved anything 
hugo otero adviser to garcia told the associated press the 
president canceled appointments for the day because of the breakout 
officials did not say how the escape was engineered but sources 
in the interior ministry who asked not to be named said given the 
high number that escaped they may have gotten inside help 
prison workers have been on strike for months demanding higher 
pay corrections department officials said striking workers had 
been replaced by temporary workers 
police said they had closed off roads leading from the city and 
detained more than 2000 people throughout the metropolitan area 
who were not carrying documents 
on may 14 a column of 300 mrta rebels seized the northern 
jungle town of saposoa freeing 35 suspected guerrillas from the 
towns jail and robbing three banks 
the mrta takes its name from an 18th century mestizo or mixed 
blood revolutionary who led a peasant revolt against spanish 
colonial rule in the andes 
it is smaller and less radical than the maoist shining path 
guerrilla group which has been fighting since 1980 the government 
says more than 18500 people have died in the decade of political 
violence including police soldiers rebels government officials 
and civilians

east german officials have 
discovered what they said were two mass graves of people executed 
by soviet secret police the east german news agency adn reported 
monday 
the discovery on the site of a former nazi concentration camp 
was the latest in disclosures on alleged atrocities committed by 
the soviet occupiers who directly ran what is now east germany 
until 1949 
adn did not say what evidence existed to assume the victims were 
executed by the soviets rather than by nazi troops 
the nazis set up the forced labor camp on berlins northern 
outskirts in 1936 more than half its 200000 inmates died of 
execution starvation or disease before the red army captured the 
camp and interned nazis and nazi sympathizers there 
investigation into purported atrocities followed the ouster of 
east germanys hardline communist leadership last fall

air force doctors informed former hostage frank 
reed that his captors poisoned him with arsenic during his 44 
months in captivity the former hostage said monday 
reed also said that hostage brian keenans sister had told him 
in a telephone conversation from belfast northern ireland that 
negotiations toward the irish educators release were 50 percent 
finished 
i think its the most wonderful news ive heard since ive 
been home reed said of keenans possible release brian and i 
were mates in the holes the hideouts brian on several occasions 
tried to intervene to try to stop the beatings that were going on 
a shiite source in beirut lebanon said iran was pushing hard 
for the release of a hostage in appreciation for aid it received 
after the devastating june 21 earthquake 
the irish red cross flew the first western relief plane into 
tehran after the earthquake in which 40000 people were killed 
based on hair and nail samples air force and justice department 
officials believe reed 57 was given arsenic over a long period of 
time and one large dose shortly before he was released april 30 
reed told boston television station whdh 
the news made reed wonder if keenan may also have been given 
arsenic 
brian was exhibiting the same symptoms that i had of arsenic 
poisoning so let us hope that it hasnt been too severe brian and 
i got in a little trouble over there together and maybe they were 
giving it to him for the same reasons he said 
reed speculated that the captors goal may have been to subdue 
the hostages or to make them appear sickly in order to speed 
negotiations 
exposure to high levels of arsenic can produce a burning pain in 
the esophagus and stomach vomiting diarrhea and depression 
prolonged exposure can lead to a rapid feeble pulse and 
circulatory collapse 
traces of arsenic are present in water and food especially 
seafood 
a spokesman at the malcolm grow medical center on andrews air 
force base in maryland said reed was released from the hospital on 
friday neither reed the justice department nor medical personnel 
on the base could be reached for comment late monday 
the hospital reported last month that tests on reed had found 
arsenic but gave no indication of deliberate poisoning 
hostages held in the middle east include six americans four 
britons two west germans two swiss an irishman and an italian 
the longest held is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent 
for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
keenan was taken hostage april 11 1986

the us border patrol arrested a 
record 947 alleged illegal immigrants in a weekend raid and 
officials said monday that arrests of aliens are up more than 40 
percent over last year 
the thing that this illustrates is the volume of illegal alien 
traffic that we are dealing with down here said ted swofford 
the border patrols supervising patrol agent for the san diego 
sector 
this and other raids also indicate that illegal immigrants are 
coming across the border steadily throughout the year and that jobs 
other than seasonal farm work are luring them he said 
its just gradually increasing the seasonal fluctuations have 
evened out swofford said 
arrests of illegal immigrants are running 40 percent to 50 
percent above last years levels he said 
charles wheeler director of the nonprofit national immigration 
law center in los angeles said this shows that the 
administrations efforts to control illegal immigration through 
employer sanctions have not worked to discourage aliens from coming 
to the united states 
all but 10 of the 947 taken into custody at the san clemente 
border checkpoint were from mexico the mexicans all were returned 
after waiving deportation hearings swofford said 
deportation proceedings were being held for the others from 
guatemala india egypt el salvador and australia he said 
the last major sweep was three years ago when 720 suspected 
illegal immigrants were arrested in a 24hour period officials 
said 
four other people were taken into custody for possible alien 
smuggling swofford said some were released but he did not have 
further details 
the sweep was accomplished by a team of 67 agents who manned the 
border checkpoint and fanned out into fields on both sides of 
interstate 5 said douglas becktel a supervising border patrol 
agent 
northbound freeway traffic was tied up for several miles from 5 
pm to 10 pm saturday 
a helicopter searchlight helped spot illegal immigrants 
attempting to get around the checkpoint most of those arrested 
were either walking or riding in cars and trucks trying to cross 
the checkpoint becktel said

immigration officials monday night offered to 
release anticastro militant orlando bosch from federal prison and 
place him under a restrictive house arrest his attorney said 
bosch a convicted terrorist who has been imprisoned since 1988 
when he illegally entered the united states could be released as 
early as tuesday if he agrees to the governments terms said 
attorney raoul cantero 
for two years the justice department has sought to deport 
bosch but 31 countries have said they will not take him 
boschs family maintains the 63yearold former pediatrician is 
suffering from ulcers and that years in prison have taken their 
toll 
bosch was jailed for 11 years in venezuela for the 1976 bombing 
of a cuban jetliner that killed all 73 people aboard mostly cuban 
athletes 
after being acquitted in three trials bosch returned to miami 
in 1988 to be reunited with his family and was immediately 
arrested for violating his parole 
the bosch controversy has been a cause celebre for miamis 
staunchly anticastro cuban exile community which has held rallies 
and demonstrations on his behalf attended by leading politicians 
the twopage list of conditions for boschs release that the 
government set include requirements that bosch wear an electronic 
monitoring device remain at home for 21 hours a day keep a 
visitors log and allow his telephone to be monitored said richard 
smith director of the us immigration and naturalization service 
in miami 
bosch also would be subject to unannounced searches lie 
detector tests and would be banned from meeting with any cuban 
exile groups that advocate violence to achieve their political 
goals according to cantero 
the agreement also says the ins can alter the terms of boschs 
house arrest program at any time and if instructed he must 
present himself for deportation within 72 hours smiths statement 
said 
attorney henry adorno said bosch would agree to all the 
conditions except for the visitors log 
keeping the log would indicate to the people of this community 
that he is an informant he is not an informant he believes that 
lists are kept by people like joe mccarthy and fidel castro said 
adorno 
this set of conditions is so ridiculous you get more freedom 
in a communist country than you do with this its pure 
harassment said myriam bosch one of boschs daughters 
the release offer signified a departure for the justice 
department which has maintained for years that bosch would 
continue his terrorist ways if released 
it would be prejudicial to the public interest for the us to 
provide a safe haven for bosch we must look on terrorism as a 
universal evil even if it is directed toward those with whom we 
have no political sympathy wrote actingassociate attorney 
general joseph whitley in a 1989 deportation order 
even before the airliner bombing in which he has denied 
involvement bosch had an extensive record of involvement in 
terrorist acts directed at fidel castros communist government 
in 1968 he was convicted of firing a bazooka at a freighter at 
the port of miami he was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison 
and was paroled in 1972 
in 1974 bosch fled the country in violation of parole he 
traveled throughout central and south america using aliases

state 
norma mccorvey the jane roe of the us supreme court case roe 
vs wade said she and her lawyer gloria allred have sent a 
letter to louisiana gov buddy roemer urging him to veto the bill 
the bill approved sunday night bans all abortions except those 
to end pregnancies that endanger a womans life and those caused by 
rape or incest that are promptly reported the bill is weaker than 
one roemer vetoed last week but still would be the nations 
strictest state abortion law 
roemer has 20 days to veto the bill before it goes into effect 
if he vetoes it the only way the legislature could revive it would 
be to call itself into special session for another override vote 
if this bill is not vetoed not only will women lose their 
rights as individuals but women will have illegal abortions that 
may possibly end up in death said ms mccorvey 
she and ms allred called on feminist groups to urge the 
governor to veto the bill 
ms allred said she also plans to ask businesses in louisiana to 
help with her fight 
ms roe and i will help to organize a womancott of 
louisiana and urge all businesses to refuse to hold conventions and 
conferences in that state she said we will not allow 
louisiana to continue to make a profit while at the same time 
attempting to kill women 
the 1973 roe vs wade case which originated in texas made 
abortion legal the us supreme court said a womans 
constitutional right to privacy included the right to have an 
abortion the high court judged a texas state law making abortion a 
crime unconstitutional

a death row inmate got an indefinite 
stay monday fewer than 15 hours before his scheduled execution and 
another condemned man was granted a temporary reprieve 
roy allen stewart and william squires both had been scheduled to 
die in floridas electric chair tuesday 
stewart under his third death warrant got a temporary stay 
monday from a state judge in miami he is now scheduled for 
execution at 701 am wednesday 
squires under his first warrant turned to the federal courts 
monday for the first time and got a stay several hours later from a 
judge in fort myers 
stewart 34 was condemned for the february 1979 murder of a 
77yearold woman who invited him into her home for a sandwich but 
became angry after seeing him take a gold watch 
squires 48 was convicted of the september 1980 fatal shooting 
of a service station attendant in hillsborough county 
none of the 22 men executed in florida since the state resumed 
capital punishment in 1979 went to the electric chair under the 
first death warrant 
defense attorneys for the men reprieved monday have alleged that 
floridas electric chair is broken and would subject their clients 
to cruel and unusual punishment 
in may during the execution of jesse tafero smoke and flames 
rose from the head piece over taferos hea 
the defense attorneys who also raised the claim in the case of 
condemned black widow killer judi buenoano last month say the 
problem was a broken head electrode that has not been fixed the 
electrode they say lowered the level of electricity from a fatal 
2400 volts to a mere 90 or 100 volts 
the state department of corrections however maintains that the 
problems in the tafero execution were caused by a new synthetic 
sponge that has been replaced 
several state and federal courts have rejected the defense 
contentions the issue is pending before the 11th us circuit 
court of appeals in atlanta which issued ms buenoano an 
indefinite stay

quarterly drop since the company went public 22 years ago

company said july 6 that gannett would issue its actual earnings 
report for the apriljune period in a few weeks

analysts who forecast that gannetts net income would be below the 
1121 million or 70 cents a share of the yearearlier quarter 
however he would not predict specific earnings figures 
a decline in earnings would indicate how gannett is being 
affected by a slump that has hit the entire newspaper industry a 
number of wall street analysts have forecast declines for earnings 
of many newspaper publishers because of the soft ad revenue 
we started to see softness in advertising business in 1989 
and have been getting softer in the last eight to 12 months 
mccorkindale said we have not seen any signs of improved 
business conditions 
the expected earnings decline would come at a difficult time for 
gannett 
the gannett foundation the companys largest shareholder 
announced april 26 that it planned to sell its 10 percent stake a 
weak stock price could make the company a possible takeover target

ralph ingersoll ii agreed to give up control of 
his us newspapers after failing to make an interest payment on 
junk bonds 
the publisher said he would trade his us interests and their 
troublesome debt to his investment partners in exchange for control 
of a smaller group of european newspapers 
ingersoll whose us properties included the new haven conn 
register and the shortlived st louis sun said the july 2 deal 
was driven by a desire to get more involved in european publishing 
but bankers and investors with knowledge of the publisher said 
ingersoll was facing the same reckoning as robert campeau and 
donald trump who also used junk bond financing to build business 
empires but couldnt handle their massive interest payments 
he has an unworkable balance sheet said james rubin an 
analyst at md sass investors services a new york investment firm 
that successfully urged bondholders to reject ingersolls bid to 
work out his debt troubles this spring 
rubin said ingersoll took on too much debt in buying daily and 
weekly newspapers and was hurt further by the nationwide slump in 
advertising revenue 
ingersoll is relinquishing his stake in three companies that 
publish dozens of daily and weekly newspapers to the new york 
investment firm em warburg pincus amp co the two had been joint 
owners although ingersoll had voting control 
warburg pincus gains full control of ingersoll newspapers inc 
which publishes nine dailies and 53 weeklies new haven acquisition 
co publisher of the register and community newspapers inc 
which has newspapers in ohio and on new yorks long island 
ingersoll president robert jelenic formerly secondincommand 
was made chief executive officer of the new company 
ingersoll meanwhile will gain control of a group of british 
and irish newspapers that he controlled jointly with warburg 
pincus 
the announcement came as community newspapers said it would not 
make a july 1 interest payment on its 125 million in 13 percent 
junk bonds ingersoll had been trying for months to buy back the 
bonds at a steep discount to alleviate his debt burden 
in a telephone interview ingersoll said the three us 
companies were on track to make 100 million in profits before 
taxes and interest this year on revenue of 400 million 
we are having a record year despite the economy he said 
the companies could have serviced their debt if not for the 
collapse of the junk bond market which hit bonds like community 
newspapers especially hard ingersoll said 
the announcement comes a little more than two months after 
ingersoll folded the st louis sun a new tabloid that he hoped 
would revolutionize the slumping newspaper market by using new 
technology and marketing strategies 
the british and irish newspapers ingersoll is gaining have 
combined circulations exceeding 1 million and annual revenue of 
178 million 
europe offers great opportunities because of the planned 
dropping of trade barriers in western europe and the spread of 
freemarket economies in the east ingersoll said

the journalist jailed unless youre just offended that the 
journalist wouldnt buckle under to you she said 
karem has refused to say who arranged an interview with henry 
david hernandez accused of killing a san antonio police officer 
last year in the telephone interview hernandez said from the jail 
that he shot the officer in selfdefense

in his trial 
copeland said he learned the name june 29 through his own 
investigation and tried to tell the judge but was told priest 
could not discuss the case with him

new york state is preparing to enter the 
negotiations between the daily news and its 10 unions the head of 
the state mediation board said july 3 
the chairman of the panel hezekiah brown said that because of 
union support for state intervention he would begin the process 
leading to a formal state inquiry into contract negotiations at the 
tabloid 
brown would look at the negotiations between the paper and the 
unions if he determined it could be helpful to a settlement he 
would recommend the state labor commissioner form a board of 
inquiry 
a board of inquiry usually formed during a strike is used to 
air differences between disputing parties and help them resolve 
their problems it has subpoena power but no enforcement power 
the daily news is involved in contentious negotiations with the 
10 unions making up the allied printing trades council over 
contracts that expired in march 
one of the first steps toward a board of inquiry is to get at 
least one of the parties in a dispute to say it wants a board 
the council adopted a unanimous resolution july 3 supporting a 
board because it said in a statement efforts to effect 
voluntary settlement of the disputes at the daily news have been 
unsuccessful 
the unions complain among other things that the hired 
negotiators are not familiar with operations at the news that the 
news is trying to eliminate the unions and that strikes or 
lockouts are feared 
john t sloan the papers vice president for human resources 
did not return telephone calls seeking comment his secretary 
referred a reporter to a statement sloan made earlier that the news

newspapers could be liable in some instances for 
the acts of their delivery people the arizona supreme court said 
july 3 
the decision came on a lawsuit filed by william santiago a 
motorcyclist injured in a 1986 collision with frank frausto who 
was delivering sunday editions of the arizona republic 
trial judge daniel nastro of maricopa county superior court 
ruled that santiago could not sue the republics corporate parent 
phoenix newspapers inc because frausto was an independent 
contractor and not a pni employee 
the supreme court in its 50 decision said nastro should have 
let a jury decide the question because there was conflicting 
evidence as to fraustos relationship to pni 
a jury could infer that frausto was an employee because 
pni involved itself with the details of delivery received directly 
all customer complaints and changes so as to remove much of 
fraustos independence retained broad discretion to terminate and 
relied heavily on fraustos services for the survival of its 
business the court said 
the jury also could infer that frausto was an independent 
contractor because he used his own car was subject to little 
supervision provided some of his own supplies and could have 
someone else deliver for him within limits 
fraustos contract with pni specifically said that he was an 
independent contractor not an employee 
but the court said contract language does not determine the 
relationship and that juries must look to such factors as the 
extent to which the workers set their own hours and working 
conditions their degree of specialization who pays for the 
material how long the relationship lasts whether pay varies with 
the work how important the work is to the employers bottom line 
and how the parties to the contract see their relationship

a state appeals court has overturned 
32500 in damages awarded to a santa cruz man who sued a womens 
group for libel after its newsletter named him as a wouldbe rapist 
without proof 
in a ruling june 27 the 6th district court of appeal said the 
trial judge failed to tell the jury that it had to find negligence 
by santa cruz women against rape before awarding damages for libel 
it also said the jury should have been told that a deliberate or 
reckless falsehood was required for punitive damages which made up 
most of the award 
a lawyer for steven carney whose damages were reversed by the 
ruling said july 2 that he looked forward to a new trial 
well get a better verdict said attorney david sabih 
negligence is failure to investigate they admitted they never 
investigated this girls complaint 
sabih said the center had stopped publishing the names of 
alleged rapists in its newsletter based solely on the statements of 
the centers clients the practice that led to the suit 
the court said a 19yearold drug store coworker of carneys 
identified as karen w came to the center in june 1984 and told 
staffers that carney and another man had taken advantage of her the 
previous night after she had passed out drunk five months later 
the center printed carneys name description and workplace in its 
newsletter under the heading assaultattempted rape 
the center admitted it had relied solely on the womans account 
and its observations of her behavior and had not tried to contact 
carney or investigate in any other way the court said 
before the trial karen w sent carney a letter part of a 
settlement of suits they had filed against each other saying she 
had not been raped or had sex with either man

nbc says it wasnt trying to fool anyone with 
its special morning coverage july 5 of the dramatic match between 
zina garrison and steffi graf 
many viewers in the united states might not have known that the 
coverage was taped not live 
garrisons upset of the twotime defending womens champion had 
been over more than an hour but the only indication of that was a 
single announcement by host bob costas midway through the telecast 
there were no other reminders no graphic on the screen 
we didnt think it was necessary because costas made an 
announcement about halfway through the match said network 
spokesman ed markey we werent trying to mislead viewers at 
all 
markey said nbc had been faced with showing the whole match on 
tape delay or picking it up in progress 
the all england lawn tennis club and not nbc schedules the 
matches and garrisongraf was entering the third set when nbc came 
on the air 
if we can go on live thats our obvious preference markey 
said but our main objective is to present the match to viewers 
as a complete story and in as close a sequence of how it unfolded 
as possible 
given the restrictions we felt that was the best way to 
accomplish that

transport plane that killed 248 us soldiers 
kdka filed the suit june 29 in us district court in 
washington dc managing editor jim esser said july 6 that the 
station is requesting more than 2000 pages of documents 
esser said the station filed the suit after making 70 requests 
for documents with numerous government agencies the requests under 
the federal freedom of information act turned up nothing that the 
station considered significant he said 
the agencies sued included the justice department and the fbi 
esser would only say the station was seeking documents related to 
the crash 
kdka began looking into the accident because 14 families in the 
pittsburgh area lost relatives in the crash weve turned up 
enough unanswered questions that we feel it has to be pursued 
esser said 
the crash occurred dec 12 1985 in gander newfoundland 
canada it also killed eight crew members of the chartered arrow

a year ago the idea would have been unthinkable 
now it is the most compelling question to confront these leaders of 
the western world should they dig into their deep pockets to help 
the soviet union and mikhail s gorbachev 
the risk of saying no could be the failure of perestroika the 
ambitious restructuring of the soviet system and gorbachevs 
downfall but saying yes has its perils too since it would mean 
pouring billions into an economic morass that has resisted five 
years of gorbachev reforms 
but where would we be if he were chucked out brian 
mulroney the canadian prime minister wondered aloud on sunday as 
he and leaders of the six other richest nations gathered for their 
annual economic summit still mulroney himself isnt ready to 
provide direct help just now 
even more skeptical is president bush who received gorbachevs 
plea for help in his role as summit host the president questions 
the wisdom of assisting the kremlin while it provides 5 billion a 
year to marxist cuba spends about onequarter of its budget on the 
military and has put few freemarket procedures into play

democratic rep james mcclure clarke is being 
cast by the republican party as one of the worst violators of the 
public trust in the savings and loan crisis 
why the north carolina lawmaker voted last year to let the 
industry continue investing in junk bonds so did 113 other house 
members none of whom were criticized for that on the gop hit list 
clarke is one of the politicians caught in the crossfire as 
democrats develop the theme they hope to ride to the white house in 
1992 and republicans respond with fusillades of their own 
the result is a spotlight on a handful of house members facing 
the voters this fall and some of them arent too happy about the

expenses than they were 30 years ago a team of government 
economists reports 
the bite is about the same as in 197273 said the health care 
financing administration researchers 
the reason says katharine r levit is that private insurance 
is providing more benefits in large part because states are 
requiring more coverage and employers have been unsuccessful in 
shifting the costs of better coverage to workers 
thats bound to change she predicts as consumers are pressured 
to carry a larger share of the burden

portauprince haiti ap one of the worlds dirtiest 
capitals is becoming cleaner because publicspirited citizens got 
fed up with the filth and decided to tackle it themselves 
everybodys sick and tired and ashamed of the situation 
said cayotte bissainthe codirector of lave figi potoprens creole 
for lets wash the face of portauprince 
if the government cant cope well roll up our sleeves and 
clean up the mess ourselves she said 
from her makeshift office downtown bissainthe and three other 
unpaid members of the lave figi steering committee coordinate 100 
neighborhood committees involved in the project 
cleanup squads have been taking a city block at a time 
sweeping hauling away refuse hosing down and sometimes repairing 
the pavement even planting trees in old tires filled with earth 
in some cases theyve added a decorative touch by painting wall 
murals 
the response has been wonderful and shows how full of life and 
hope the haitian people are in spite of all our troubles 
bissainthe said 
this destitute city of more than 1 million people has long been 
not only unsightly but woefully unsanitary with chesthigh heaps 
of garbage on every corner and sometimes even in the middle of the 
street 
only 50 percent of the 500 tons of garbage the capital produces 
daily was picked up even in better times before the public works 
ministry took over garbage collection from the city last year 
torrential rains washed the rest downhill through the slums and 
into the polluted bay 
ecologists of the federation of the friends of nature raised 
alarms about the health hazard but the city government went broke 
and through similar mismanagement and corruption so did the 
public works ministry 
since april 12 when the government officially recognized it 
lave figi has received 4350 in private donations ranging from 
individual gifts of 2 to a 2100 contribution from the roman 
catholic charity caritas 
president ertha pascaltrouillots civilian government which 
assumed power march 13 is in financial straits and has not yet 
been able to fulfill its promise of funds for the campaign 
lave figi has used the donated money to buy safety masks and 
hire workers to load garbage trucks businessmen provide some 
workers on loan 
shovels rakes and wheelbarrows have been donated the 
government provides the garbage trucks and lave figi fills the gas 
tanks and tips the drivers 
we have no choice but to do it ourselves our lives and our 
dignity depend on it said bissainthe who was haitis consul 
general in puerto rico for a time after dictator jeanclaude 
duvalier fled the country in 1986 
response to lave figi was immediate from a citizenry that 
suffered one variety of flu after another and had to live with 
stench flies roaches and rats sixty neighborhood organizations 
joined as soon as it was formed 
it isnt as much as we need but it encourages us to go on 
said max valbrun 24 coleader of the dehoux street youth 
committee in our four years existence this is the first time 
we have been able to get any outside help 
the 50 youths of the dehoux street committee clean up their 
street at least three times a week 
lave figi is nonpartisan but bissainthe said community action 
is part of the struggle for democracy in haiti 
the same community effort to clean its collective house 
occurred spontaneously after the fall of duvalier but this time 
the movement is organized citywide she said 
our aim is to give it a permanent structure to set up a 
nonprofit association which will see that our citizens initiative 
lives on and on and on

america land of immigrants has long been of 
two minds about immigration 
on the one hand people remember their own forebears they react 
to the words on the base of the statue of liberty 
on the other hand the new immigrant is often resented when the 
irish were pouring into america by the tens of thousands to avoid 
famine public sentiment was against irish immigration 
when italians arrived by the boatload to provide the labor 
supply that transformed the country from an agricultural society 
into an industrialized society sentiment was antiitalian 
when the chinese settled in san francisco and became famous for 
the laundries they operated their nonchinese competitors 
persuaded the state legislature to require that laundries be built 
of brick somehow the only launderers prosecuted for working out 
of wooden buildings were chinese 
theres always been at work a lastoneofftheboat 
pulluptheladder syndrome 
organized labor normally on the liberal side of issues 
frequently opposes liberalized immigration it suspects immigrants 
will take jobs and take lower wages 
old guard conservatives also often want to restrict immigration 
they fear that the western european heritage that is the foundation 
of the constitution and the culture will be worn away under waves 
of todays newcomers many darkskinned and from the third world 
who know nothing of the bible the magna carta checks and balances 
yet humanitarian instincts exert their own tug the land of 
opportunity over the decades has sheltered those yearning to be 
free 
exerting the tug these days are russian jews and eastern 
europeans who waited for years for the opportunity to leave and 
risked much by applying to go vietnamese who jeopardized their 
lives to flee home in dangerous boats afghans who fought in a war 
supported by the united states 
let them in argues a conservative economist stephen moore who 
said he bases his appeal not on any squishy sentimentality but on 
selfserving pragmatism 
i see it not that were doing good for them but that they do 
good for us he said 
moore formerly with the heritage foundation is executive 
director of the american immigration institute newly founded to 
campaign for increased immigration its cochairmen are a 
conservative sen rudy boschwitz rminn who was born in berlin 
and a liberal mayor raymond flynn of boston 
if americas going to continue to be a firstclass economic 
power weve got to be able to compete moore said in an 
interview if an immigrant works 18 hours a day thats not 
something to be held against him thats what capitalism is all 
about work hard and youll get ahead 
he said the united states now admits about three immigrants per 
1000 residents at the turn if the century it was 15 per 1000 
his group wants to return to 15 
at the same time as a conservative moore opposes the 5000 
per person given refugees but not immigrants resettling in the 
united states as a safety net he said it implants a welfare 
mentality starts the newcomers off looking for handouts 
refugees locating in california have four times as high a 
dependency rate and only half the labor force participation rate as 
do those in texas where benefits are less than half as generous 
he said in an essay in policy review published by the heritage 
foundation he would substitute lowinterest loans 
us law distinguishes between immigrants and refugees and 
between economic refugees and political refugees those who have 
a wellfounded fear of persecution if they were returned to 
their former country of residence 
currently the united states admits about 600000 people a year 
of whom about 100000 are political refugees it is sometimes 
estimated that illegal immigration brings the annual total to 1 
million 
moore argues that the distinction between political and economic 
refugees no longer makes sense the policy he said translates to 
we will not let you die at the hands of the executioner but are 
ambivalent to your death from economic deprivation 
he cites what happened 10 years ago in what became known as the 
mariel boat lift thousands of cubans let loose by fidel castro as 
a safety valve for his islands faltering economy traveling in 
tiny boats arrived in florida ultimately they numbered about 
120000 
americans looked askance in a poll 91 percent said all 
immigration to the united states should be halted until the 
national unemployment rate then 7 percent fell to 5 percent 
much was made of the psychotics and the criminals castro sent 
along with economic immigrants 
but if you look at the vast majority who came they have 
assimilated extraordinarily well in the miami economy which 
throughout the 1980s flourished said moore miami mayor xavier 
suarez called the boat lift the greatest rescue mission since 
normandy 
moore said a study done at princeton university found that eight 
years after the mariel outpouring other minority groups had not 
suffered from the infusion of lowskilled workers 
if 100000 cubans could assimilate in a very short time in one 
labor market the idea of bringing in more than 600000 into the 
national economy shouldnt frighten us he said 
immigrants have a very high rate of entrepreneurship he 
said we see this in the refugee groups the koreans the 
vietnamese the afghans it is very common to see afghans owning 
convenience stores parking lots taxicab franchises theyre not 
only starting businesses theyre often hiring american workers

too old for headbanging music too much 
smoke get in your eyes at rock concerts tired of shelling out the 
big bucks for concert tickets only to have a view that reduces the 
performer to the size of a peanut 
take heart in the privacy of your own home there is a way to 
see some of the hottest musicians in the business up close with 
no special effects and sans earsplitting amplification 
in an industry where folk music and acoustic guitars are making 
a comeback television too has picked up a softer beat when it 
comes to rock n roll 
one of the more unlikely places to see it is on mtv the music 
networks unplugged which airs sundays at 11 pm offers a 
mix of bigname stars and upandcoming musicians in a decidedly 
different format from its usual flash and fire the music is 
performed live specifically for the program in intimate studio 
settings no videos or concert clips 
unplugged which debuted in january has only one rule no 
matter who you are no matter what kind of music you play 
everything on this show is acoustic no amps 
showtimes coast to coast is another place to see favorite 
rockers up close without hype and in original live performances 
unlike unplugged showtimes program which has no scheduled 
time slot does not take place in a television studio and musicians 
can use all the amplification they want 
instead writerdirectorproducer ken ehrlich assembles a 
gathering of likeminded musicians to play whatever their hearts 
desire at various clubs across the country 
hosted by herbie hancock the latest coast to coast 
installment will air saturday and features a custommade 
celebration of jazz blues and country music by performers such as 
bonnie raitt john lee hooker lee ritenour john hiatt and john 
prine 
a recent unplugged show featuring exeagle don henley was so 
successful it actually helped record sales said geffen records 
spokeswoman bryn bridenthal we definitely see an impact from the 
show she said 
these shows not only offer a new format for oldtime rock n 
rollers they also provide an inexpensive way to boost the image of 
mtv and showtime 
on mtvs unplugged which also has featured sets by sinead 
oconnor and elton john the performers work for free on coast 
to coast they are paid scale only about 250 
by comparison the televising of major rock concerts such as 
madonnas blonde ambition on hbo or the rolling stones steel 
wheels on fox can cost big bucks mtv doesnt feel its is worth it 
the cost of such live shows can be phenomenal said mtvs 
senior vice president of programming doug herzog we had looked 
at live shows but everyone does them 
the idea for unplugged herzog said came after heavy 
metaler jon bon jovi did an acoustic set on the last mtv awards 
lee masters the popular mtv executive who quit last fall 
explained the premise of unplugged more bluntly 
my guess was that it was not going to be a big ratings 
getter said masters who was involved with the shows inception 
before he left 
it was designed to get some great press for the channel it 
was meant as an image piece you cant get don henley to do a 
concert on mtv because hes going to charge you a lot of money 
he added the twist was lets get some people and let them play 
acoustically 
said herzog at first we were a little nervous i think there 
was a little bit of concern that it was going to turn into the 
campfire show 
but the response from shows such as henleys as well as ones 
featuring acclaimed singers such as michelle shocked and the indigo 
girls has lead to an avalanche of requests from performers herzog 
said 
weve had some really really big names call and say they want 
to do it he said its really a place for musicians and their 
songs were trying not to hand it out to very band that comes 
along 
at showtime ehrlich has been able to coax some of the most shy 
singers in the business to do his show a segment featuring van 
morrison a wellknown hater of live performing will air in 
september 
part of the reason is that ehrlich has known such folks for a 
long time he has produced big shows such as the grammy awards as 
well as more humble ventures such as coast to coast which 
debuted in 1987 
ehrlich also is the man who did the critically acclaimed 
soundstage on pbs the granddaddy as he calls it of 
upclose music shows 
whats happened to audiences today is theyve been detached 
from that upclose personal oneonone relationship with the 
artist ehrlich said someone who wants to enjoy the music has 
a tough time of it from two football fields away

in theory there may be something funny about a 
young new york doctor winding up in a small alaskan town so far 
back in the woods that the mayor is a bear 
the bad news is that northern exposure has no bear 
this new cbs summer series which premieres thursday has only 
the young new york doctor the small alaskan town and an 
openingshow script that starts amusingly then comes down with 
attack of the feebles 
this does not bode well for a onehour series that hopes to go 
beyond the eight weeks cbs is giving it 
be that as it may rob morrow stars here as a cocky new york 
yuppie pardon the redundancy fresh out of columbia medical 
school his first job is in alaska because that state in need of 
doctors financed his education 
in return he must work there for four years leaving behind his 
lawschool fiancee he nervously arrives in anchorage bearing golf 
clubs and telling a state official he needs a few days to get a 
condo cable tv and such 
er we now have too many doctors the official says but the 
state will set him up in the backwoods hamlet of cicely the young 
sawbones falsely told he can leave the town if he doesnt like it 
decides to give it a shot 
thus is the stage set for a clash of cultures the bigcity kid 
used to bright lights and brie versus the sturdy stoic inmates of 
a world so removed from new york that one inhabitant even asks 
whats a bagel 
well sure as heck the new sawbones wants out with seven shows 
to go though you can safely lay 100to1 odds he wont make it 
some observers might contend that northern exposure is a 
faint echo of abcs twin peaks which also is set in a small 
backwoods town not so for one thing twin peaks occurs in 
washington state 
for another peaks has stoplights exposure doesnt and 
there is no murdered homecoming queen in cbs show although 
suppose its homecoming queen is a bear naaaah 
however like peaks exposure does have characters who 
are a little eccentric one even is a kid who wears a black 
leather jacket and whose black hair is parted in the middle 
another is a woman who brings a sick beaver in for treatment 
saying i think his teeth hurt theres also a man who shot in 
the leg by his wife explains she said loud doesnt work with 
me anymore 
theres a beautiful charter pilot a native of wealthy grosse 
point mich whose true love froze to death on a glacier and a 
tavern owner whose best friend vows to shoot him dead if the latter 
ever speaks to him 
this is because the bar owner john cullum explains his 
friend imported a beautiful young woman to marry but one day she 
showed up alone at his bar and said if i wanted her she was 
mine a pause i did 
the friend barry corbin a middleaged former astronaut owns 
15000 acres the town newspaper and its radio station hes 
cicleys biggest booster and it turns out ready to do harm to its 
new doctor if he tries to leave 
weve got an outstanding little town here joel ready to step 
up in the world he says when they first meet weve got 
natural resources weve got land weve got wildlife just waiting 
to be fondled 
despite such strangeness these characters are basically decent 
folk and have none of the deapan madness of the twin peaks 
citizenry 
morrow as the young doctor is very good even in a script that 
after a few nice touches of whimsy just sort of wanders off to a 
finale featuring a town festival where our hero munches morosely on 
a mooseburger 
in a way northern exposure may remind some of local 
hero a 1983 film about a texas oil yuppie who finds the meaning 
of life while on business in a remote seacoast town in scotland 
but that clashofcultures exercise was both funny and moving 
cbs alaskan expedition created by st elsewhere creators 
joshua brand and john falsey is more like what happens when you 
eat a mooseburger its mildly interesting at the start and then 
it just sits there

koncinski is one of only four yearround staff members at the 
mccall base he is the loft foreman the supervisor of parachutes 
which undergo some rugged use the others are a director of 
training a loadmaster who sees to equipment and cargo and 
hurricane davis the base manager 
mccall with 70 jumpers is the largest of nine bases in idaho 
montana northern california oregon washington and alaska but 
during the fire season the jumpers move from base to base depending 
on where the action is at one point last year 167 jumpers were 
camped at mccall and on four different occasions all were fighting 
fires none in reserve 
except for the smattering of administrators who also jump all 
smokejumpers hire on only for the fire season most return year 
after year they are a varied bunch at mccall three doctors a 
lawyer a professor of entomology a veterinarian a high school 
principal several teachers all must pass a rigorous physical test 
each summer to requalify their average age is 32 
if they have one thing in common it is a love of the outdoors 
of nature keep a light hand on the land is their dictum 
its quite a feeling said roger staats a 25yearold 
jumper from colorado to stand on a ridge over a canyon and think 
you might be the only person to have set foot on that spot i dont 
want to leave any evidence that i was there 
once in the wilderness we found a little snowmelt stream 
nearby and we diverted it to help catch the fire when the fire was 
out we put the stream back where it was 
most like koncinski who was a forestry student at the 
university of connecticut learned about the smokejumpers when they 
took summer jobs as forest service firefighters to earn college 
tuition 
about 500 hopefuls apply each year for only a handful of 
openings all must have experience fighting wildfire but theyll 
tell you that veteran smokejumpers and their own experience has 
taught them more than they ever learned on a fire line 
they learn that when lightning hits a tree the tree explodes in 
a spray of burning faggots or else it spirals down the trunk 
peeling bark like a corkscrew down to the roots setting the 
forest undergrowth ablaze 
they learn that a few spruce trees are more dangerous than a 
stand of lofty pines more apt to spread fire to the treetops 
because their downswept boughs reach the burning undergrowth they 
know that aspens are slow to catch fire and that the sage that 
perfumes a mountain meadow contains oils that flash off like 
gunpowder 
we get a look at the fire from the air so thats an 
advantage said jerry ogawa you have an idea of what youre 
getting into how youre going to attack it 
ogawa 44 is a fourthgrade teacher in oregon in the winter and 
a smokejumper the past 24 years at mccall he has made about 160 
jumps on fires and another 160 for practice hes seen it all and 
is one of mccalls qualified spotters the person in charge aboard 
the drop airplane 
heres how he explains the procedure 
lightning hits tree mountaintop lookout spots fire bell rings 
in the mccall ready room within 10 minutes 12 jumpers are airborne 
aboard a dc3 which is as old as jerry ogawa and maybe even as 
durable 
we circle the fire size it up check the terrain select a 
landing target and look for a route for the jumpers to pack out to 
where somebody can pick them up i once had to walk 22 miles 
then we drop streamers to tell us which way the chutes will 
drift to be on target you can only steer them so much in this 
terrain if the fire is on a ridge and you miss the target you 
could wind up halfway down a nearvertical slope and get to the 
fire too late 
the streamers also tell us our altitude we jump at 1500 
feet the plane has an altimeter of course but this country is 
all ridges and canyons and we need to be sure we need for those 
streamers to hit the ground in one minute and a half or we adjust 
up or down 
the spotter decides how many jumpers it will take to do the 
job two four six we go in pairs everybody likes twoman fires 
the best we send as few as possible so as many as possible will be 
available for other fires 
they jump land and radio back that they are safe then we 
make another pass at about 500 feet and drop their fire packs one 
pack for each two men these contain their tools just a 
breakdown shovel and a pulaski a combination axe and grubbing hoe 
and their sleeping bags first aid kit water food for six meals 
then theyre on their own 
the jumpers carry a 150foot letdown rope in one leg pocket in 
case they land in a tree which is not uncommon in fact it is 
sometimes preferred 
tall grass in a mountain clearing may look inviting but 
underneath lurk stumps and snags and rocks that can break a leg 
many a smokejumper has trusted a padded suit and crash helmet and 
steered instead for the nearest tree later he must climb the tree 
to fetch the parachute no selfrespecting smokejumper would come 
home without his chute 
they wear crash helmets with steel mesh face masks and jump 
suits heavily padded from ankle to neck these they shed on the 
ground and fight the fire in jeans and a hardhat but get this 
they draw no hazard pay for jumping into those trees and stumps and 
rocks hazard pay for these government workers begins only when 
they start fighting the fire same as if they arrived by truck 
the risks of smokejumping are obvious but the jumpers do not 
dwell on them 
sixyear jumper jim duzak a paramedic only reluctantly tells 
about the time he carried out barry koncinski after barry suffered 
two broken ankles or about the night that huge rocks loosened by 
burnedout tree roots tumbled down the mountain and broke both 
arms and a leg of a fellow jumper 
it took all night to pack him out five miles duzak recalls 
and no one mentions the fire in mann gulch mont where 13 
smokejumpers perished and three escaped but that was back in 1949 
when the service was in its infancy 
shared risk though along with unlimited confidence in one 
another account in large measure for the obvious camaraderie that 
has lured these adventurous and resourceful men and since 1982 
women back to americas great basin each year for half a century 
its a big fraternity a family said hurricane davis we 
think were among the best wait he said strike think and 
among were the best

fifty years ago two adventurous men in the employ of the us 
forest service jumped out of an airplane over martin creek in 
idahos nezperce national forest and put out a fire 
rufus robinson and earl cooley on july 12 1940 became 
americas first smokejumpers 
what began with two determined men and a revolutionary way to 
fight wildfires catch em while you still can today has grown 
to an elite corps of about 400 men and women who have logged nearly 
200000 jumps over the last half century 
six years before that first jump the idea of parachutists 
attacking fires was proposed to the montana regional forester evan 
kelley in a letter to his superior in washington kelley asked that 
if the service wanted to get into such foolishness to please do it 
in somebody elses region 
the best info i can get from experienced fliers kelley 
wrote is that all parachute jumpers are more or less crazy just 
a little bit unbalanced or they wouldnt be engaged in such a 
hazardous undertaking 
others didnt think it was harebrained at all that same year 
1940 maj william cary lee visited montana watched cooley and 
robinson train and adapted their techniques to organize the first 
paratroop training center at fort benning ga lee who later 
attained the rank of major general commanded the 101st airborne 
division in world war ii 
cooley jumped 46 times from 1940 to 1951 today he is a 
semiretired realestate agent in missoula mont which is still a 
major smokejumper base robinson died in idaho in 1987 
in a recent telephone interview cooley remembered that for him 
smokejumping almost ended the day it began 
determined to jump that day despite the conditions he and 
robinson bailed out in very strong winds 
cooleys parachute did not open properly until he was just 600 
feet from the ground and then the strong winds carried him right 
through the branches of a huge spruce tree 
i hit this tree about 100 feet up at such speed that i went 
through the branches and broke them off but my chute clung to the 
side of the tree he later wrote in his book trimotor and 
trail 
i was still swinging my heart pounding i was alive i felt 
for the 100foot rope in my right pants pocket i tied my rope to 
the chute risers but decided that the chute wasnt hung up well 
enough to trust it i climbed down the limbs to the ground 
todays smokejumpers still carry a rope in their right pants 
pocket and use it often

boise idaho ap the boise interagency fire center which 
coordinates firefighting efforts throughout the nation resembles a 
space age war room 
on one wall is a huge map of the united states a battle map as 
it were where the centers roundtheclock staff keeps track of 
every firefight raging in america and where every firefighting crew 
and piece of equipment down to the last airplane helicopter and 
pumper truck is deployed 
arrayed before the map are tiers of radar screens that blip and 
computer terminals that blink and printers that spit out 
minutebyminute weather reports and other data 
the director of the center is jack wilson a onetime 
firefighter himself who doesnt try to conceal his pride 
we monitor every single lightning stroke he said pointing 
to a screen dotted with a thousand points of light the ones that 
are flashing are the most recent bolts 
look close the shapes are different this one is a positive 
bolt one that comes down from the sky to the ground that one is 
negative which travels from the ground up 
does that make any difference in starting fires 
no just interesting

editors note the number of illegal aliens sneaking into the 
united states through canada has more than doubled in the past five 
years immigration officials say mostly refugees from third world 
countries often they place their lives in the hands of 
unscrupulous smugglers who devise dangerous ways to cross the 
border 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in the dark of night smugglers lead 
illegal immigrants over the spidery underside of a railroad bridge 
hundreds of feet above the raging niagara river that separates the 
united states and canada 
others paddle their clients across the river in flimsy rubber 
rafts and then drive them hundreds of miles so they can vanish 
anonymously into the teeming city 
upscale aliens who can pay 20000 or more ride in chartered 
planes and boats but the less wellheeled are packed like luggage 
into the trunks of cars or secret compartments not much larger 
than queensized beds in the backs of tractortrailers 
in the desert southwest these smugglers are called coyotes 
ruthless operators notorious for the callousness with which they 
treat their customers 
along the uscanadian border they are just as ruthless and 
they are becoming one of the biggest problems of the us 
immigration and naturalization service 
we obviously dont have the hordes of people that you have in 
mexico says john j ingham ins district director in buffalo 
canadians enjoy a high standard of living thats comparable with 
the united states so we dont have canadians coming across the 
border in the same way mexicans seek entry 
what ingham and his colleagues do have is a stream of refugees 
from around the globe who enter canada on tourist visas real or 
faked and then pay smugglers thousands of dollars to be ferried 
across the worlds longest unfortified border 
that stream appears to be swelling at a rapid rate by one 
measure seizures of vehicles used in smuggling attempts 
aliensmuggling into new york state alone has risen 150 percent 
since 1985 in 1985 220 vehicles were seized in 1989 the number 
was 560 and the projected figure for 1990 is more than 700 
while aliens along the mexican border typically wade the rio 
grande or cross the desert far from border stations ins officials 
suspect that most illegal aliens coming in from canada use 
established ports of entry 
although much of the uscanadian border is unfenced it is 
guarded by hidden cameras and suspicious natives who are quick to 
report strangers to the authorities ingham says at official 
border crossings however it is all too easy for aliens to blend 
in with the crowds 
its easier to cross the bridges in some ways because of the 
volumes of traffic ingham says with the backups were having 
because of the large number of shoppers coming in everyone knows 
we cant open every trunk 
jerry maffre a spokesman for employment and immigration canada 
says his agency the canadian equivalent of the ins does have a 
concern about people who come here for the sole purpose of trying 
to arrange a southbound smuggle 
however canadian immigration officials can take no action 
against them if they have entered canada legally maffre said in a 
telephone interview from ottawa 
the royal canadian mounted police has jurisdiction over attempts 
to smuggle aliens into the united states maffre said rcmp 
officials did not return several telephone calls seeking comment 
a husband and wife charged with heading separate smuggling rings 
are typical of the operators who deal in human lives ins officials 
say 
the wife cheng chuiping pleaded guilty on july 27 to 
conspiring to transport aliens illegally admitting that she paid 
an undercover canadian police agent 340 to transport three aliens 
including a pregnant woman from the toronto airport to the united 
states in march 1989 
in a written statement submitted to us district judge richard 
j arcara ms cheng said the pregnant woman was her cousin tsui 
kim wong and a woman who made the trip to toronto with her was her 
best friends daughter 
however government agents have said the pregnant woman was 
actually wang sai zhen who fled china with her husband and nephew 
so she would not be forced to undergo an abortion under chinas 
harsh familyplanning laws

the charge carries a maximum of five years in prison and a 
250000 fine but under federal sentencing guidelines ms cheng 
would probably face no more than 14 months in prison when she is 
sentenced aug 8 
the us immigration and naturalization service in a report 
last july named ms cheng 41 a resident alien who lives in new 
york city as a leader of a ring that charged wouldbe immigrants 
23000 apiece to be smuggled into the united states 
however the indictment only charged her with the 1989 incident 
which was uncovered during a covert investigation by the ins and 
the royal canadian mounted police of traffic in illegal aliens 
between toronto and new york city 
her clients according to court papers included li jin mu and 
his wife wang sai zhen the refugees whose plight became a test 
case for the new us policy allowing fear of forced abortions to 
be grounds for political asylum 
the papers state that ms cheng personally met li his wife and 
nephew at the toronto airport last march and paid a driver 340 to 
take them to the us border at queenston ontario there a second 
driver took over driving them across the border and across new 
york state to albany 
in albany another member of the ring paid the driver 3000 and 
bought the li family bus tickets to new york city but the drivers 
were undercover agents from the royal canadian mounted police and 
the ins and all involved were arrested 
months later after li and his nephew had been deported and had 
been caught in another smuggling attempt this time jammed in with 
uruguayan refugees in the back of a tractortrailer the 
government granted li and his wife political asylum 
for other aliens the consequences have been tragic 
ms chengs husband yick tak cheung is charged with smuggling 
dozens of aliens in small rubber rafts across the rapids below 
niagara falls some of the rafts were equipped with cellular phones 
that the aliens or their couriers could use to arrange for 
drivers to meet them on the us shore 
but they apparently were not equipped with life jackets and four 
aliens drowned when a raft deflated and sank in the icechoked 
river in late december 1988 
that was particularly cruel and callous on the part of the 
smugglers ingham says we perceive many of these aliens as 
victims 
court papers filed in yicks case said his ring recruited two 
lewiston taxi drivers to drive the aliens to new york city without 
at first telling them who their fares were when the cab drivers 
figured out what was going on the threats began 
in a sworn statement cab driver james dullan said an alleged 
associate of yicks told him we take care of our own one way or 
the other 
i took it as a verbal threat dullan said work with him 
or else 
yick has pleaded innocent his lawyer declined to comment 
aliens who cannot scrape together large sums of cash can still 
use the smugglers services to pay their debts to the smugglers 
some pledge themselves to years of menial work in restaurants 
others allow themselves to be recruited into chinese organized 
crime groups 
its a form of indentured servitude says dennis peruzzini 
an ins investigator in buffalo 
while chinese people comprise the single biggest nationality 
involved the border patrol has caught a veritable united nations 
of aliens in the past few years 
large numbers of jamaicans and guyanese attempted to sneak into 
the united states until canada toughened its visa requirements for 
residents of those caribbean countries agents on the new 
yorkquebec border recently found a large group of immigrants from 
india apparently dumped there by a truck driver who panicked after 
hearing about a state police truck check on the radio ingham said 
thirteen were found in a 4footdeep 8footwide hiding space 
in a truck trailer at lewiston in may 
a smuggling operator arrested a few years ago brought brazilians 
into the country by leading them across the niagara rapids on the 
underside of a railroad bridge ingham says 
hed take the group from toronto to niagara falls ontario by 
bus and then under cover of night hed take them down over the 
side of the bridge and climb onto the arches ingham says if 
you have any degree of fear of heights that is a scary place

editors note what to make of that perilprone punctuation 
the hyphen it both divides and unites in the case of the 
czechoslovak republic it did both at the same time now the french 
have chased it like an unwanted ant from piquenique ignore the 
hyphen mais non take it seriously madness a lingering look at 
the curious hyphen with a dash which is different of wit 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it is smaller than an eyelash and less protective a single 
arbitrary mark in mankinds search for order it promises clarity 
but risks anarchy and like all efforts to standardize and thus 
regulate human behavior it groans under many burdens and cries 
with painful exceptions it is used to make war and peace and 
soothe the pride of nations brides and banks 
some of us cant get the hyphen out of our minds 
come to terms with this hyphen president vaclev havel 
implored the parliament of the new czechoslovakia this spring 
but how does one make peace with a tiny elusive chameleon who 
appears in halflife but not at halftime in italianamerican but 
not in latin american in flagwaving but not childbearing a 
devious unpredictable contrary creature who shows up even in 
absentia as in hyphenless 
for 300 rococo years it was part of the austrohungarian empire 
and for three shaky weeks this year it lived again in the name of a 
descendant 
with karl marx fallen on hard times the parliament of 
czechoslovakia talked about dropping socialist from the name of 
the republic that emboldened the slovaks to try to improve their 
billing they argued for czechoslovak republic thinking the 
hyphen would let the world know the country is made up of two 
separate states 5 million slovaks in one 10 million czechs in the 
other 
the majority fought back fiercely finally the brave 
legislators came to a neosolomonic decision it would be the 
czechoslovak federative republic in the czech area and the 
czechoslovak federative republic in slovakia madder than ever 
unrequited slovaks took to the streets by the thousands demanding a 
better name or a completely independent state 
weak from a hernia operation president havel sought to defuse 
the crisis from his hospital bed he sent a speech begging his 
fellow czechs in parliament to consider that the hyphen symbolized 
the hunger of slovaks for a national identity they were denied for 
centuries under hungarian kings and even in 1918 at the birth of 
the modern nation after world war i 
he said the founding fathers thomas masaryk and eduard benes 
had a hyphenated twonation republic in mind but thought that 
would be too complicated to explain to the victorious allied powers 
then creating nations at versailles 
so they left out the dash and that is what gave rise to the 
whole painful story of czechoslovakia 
havel was so eloquent he got more than a hyphen out of 
parliament he got two spaces and an and and so it came to pass 
in a part of the world shaped by the tribal migrations before 
history and since then by wars revolutions plots coups and 
summit deals without number the nation now is officially the czech 
and slovak federative republic 
perhaps it was his hernia or the distractions of governance but 
the hero of the nations liberation might be forgiven for mistaking 
a dash for a hyphen a dash is a tad longer and in function 
probably more useful in havels work as a playwright and 
politician its first assigned mission is to indicate an emphatic 
pause or abrupt change in thought

in mr websters first definition a hyphen is used to divide or 
join words or parts of words thus from the start a hyphen is 
expected to be both a divider and a unifier which is why the 
stylebook of the oxford university press warns if you take the 
hyphen seriously you will surely go mad 
a hyphen also is expected to help avoid confusion ambiguity 
absurdity even insult it treads on treacherous turf think of the 
thin line that is crossed should you drop a hyphen from a 
smallbusiness man who is not a midget 
according to the story of english there are about 2700 
languages in the world and as with death and taxes one assumes 
the hyphen gets to most or many of them 
more people speak chinese than any other language but english 
is used in the most countries and with the orbiting impact of 
television and radio comes closest to being the planetary 
language thus le snacquebarre found its way to paris and like 
seksapil dzhinintonik surfaced in moscow 
clearly the hyphen is not exclusively an american or capitalist 
problem although the chinese might be suggesting that baden baden 
may have escaped but not bosniahercegovina yugoslavia which 
belonged to turkey until the hapsburgs took it in 1908 and made it 
part of the schizoid austrohungarian empire where the same man 
ruled as emperor on one side of the hyphen and king on the other 
and commanded different prime ministers in both 
in england whether the tories or socialists are in a woman 
with enough money or social clout joins her name to her husbands 
with a hyphen so might an insurance company and a fertilizer firm 
in the current contagion of corporate mergers 
mao tsetung is now mao zedong because the chinese officially 
changed the english phonetic spelling of chinese names which 
caused a severe drop in the hyphen market revolutionary 
governments tend to shed the clothes of their colonial masters 
ours did our honor requires us to have a system of our own 
in language as well as government noah webster wrote before 
publication of his american dictionary of the english language 
in 1828 
we may have gone too far as in a predawn vertical 
insertion which was the white houses contribution to the 
language of shakespeare and keats to announce a parachute drop in 
grenada 
through the ages language moves with an inexorable force that 
brushes aside teachers linguists critics and other unlicensed 
arbiters it gathers new words it buries rejects it accepts the 
unacceptable 
so it is with hyphens popular use tends to become proper use 
with time two words eventually become one after a period of 
hyphenation relentlessly bed chamber snuggled into bedchamber 
until it became bedchamber 
stylists in the american south were in the vanguard of the 
trend far more than a century ago they made one word out of two 
as in damnyankee

editors note he compares his job to being in the middle of a 
sack full of cats and hes felt the claws lately but interior 
secretary manuel lujan likes his work his problem aides say is 
that he thinks out loud often getting his foot lodged in his 
mouth 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<TEXT>
interior secretary manuel lujan has started 
choosing his words more carefully these days 
his earlier offthecuff remarks on everything from cattle 
grazing on federal lands to the alaska oil spill provided his 
critics with ample ammunition during his first 18 months in 
president bushs cabinet 
some of these critics have even raised questions about his 
ability to run one of the governments oldest most broadreaching 
and powerful departments 
manuel thinks out loud and that causes some difficulty once 
in a while acknowledges john schrote a top aide who has known 
lujan for two decades 
but lujan is not staying out of the spotlight 
in backtoback news conferences on one june day he was the 
point man for the bush administration on its decision to restrict 
offshore oil drilling and on its plan to balance the needs of the 
threatened spotted owl with the economics of the timber 
industry 
environmentalists hailed the former and denounced the latter 
the former new mexico congressman is not unaccustomed to being 
the target of environmentalists 
do we have to save every subspecies lujan asked recently in 
colorado maintaining that the federal endangered species act 
should be made more flexible to accommodate economic interests in 
some cases 
questioning environmentalists concerns over the construction of 
a 200 million telescope in arizona that threatens an endangered 
colony of red squirrels lujan told a reporter nobody told me 
the difference between the red squirrel a black one or a brown 
one 
the national wildlife federation sierra club and wilderness 
society and other conservationists attacked lujan in a floor 
speech senate majority leader george mitchell suggested the 
interior secretary didnt know the endangered species law he is 
supposed to implement 
among other things environmentalists have criticized lujans 
strong support for oil exploration in the arctic national wildlife 
refuge his repeated calls for more offshore oil drilling and his 
renewal of longterm water contracts in california before reviewing 
their environmental impact 
when the national park service produced a long study showing 
that sulfur emissions from an electric power plant are polluting 
the air over the grand canyon the park service wanted the 
environmental protection agency to intervene lujan instead 
referred the matter for more study by the national academy of 
sciences 
were clearly not impressed when the going gets tough he 
punts says steve whitney who follows national park issues for 
the wilderness society 
at first glance its hard to envision lujan in the midst of 
such rows 
wellliked personally even by his critics the interior 
secretary is easygoing affable and without pretensions he 
resembles more the insurance agent he once was in albuquerque than 
a cabinet member under fire 
interior is like a sack full of cats lujan says you have 
the mining interests the environmental interests the timber 
interests and the recreation interests all those different 
interests and youre in the middle of that sack trying to keep 
everybody away from each other 
all the reaction is not negative 
environmentalists praise his moves to revitalize some of the 
national parks and some of his coal mining decisions 
hes trying to do a good job you dont judge someone on 
whether hes done everything you want says paul prichard 
president of the national park and conservation association 
still some of the attacks have been vicious with critics 
suggesting that lujan may not know enough about the major issues 
facing his complex and powerful department 
its too easy to look better than james watt says david 
gardner legislative director of the sierra club it was a 
reference to the prodevelopment reaganera interior secretary 
still widely disliked among environmentalists 
newspaper headlines have called lujan the weak link in the 
bush cabinet and a magazine article last year compared him to a 
kinder dimmer version of watt 
you dont like it when they say that naturally lujan says 
one is a human being and youd rather they said nice things about 
you but ive been in politics for 20 years and im no stranger 
to criticism 
his senior aides bristle at the attacks they charge that 
environmentalists are never satisfied unless their agenda is 
followed without compromise that the eastern press is looking for 
easy headlines and that political opponents in congress all are 
eager to jump on an offhand remark

editors note along the border between south lebanon and 
israel israeliarmed lebanese christian militiamen help defend the 
jewish state against attacks by palestinian guerrillas an ap 
correspondent who recently spent a week inside what is known as 
the zone filed this report 
</TEXT>

the gulleys and hills of this killing 
ground echo with gunfire most days as guerrillas attack a lebanese 
border zone occupied by israel and its militia ally the south 
lebanon army 
at night parachute flares fired to spot infiltrators cast a 
ghostly light around the hilltop forts manned by the 3000strong 
sla mostly christians 
theyre human sandbags says an officer of the united 
nations peacekeeping force they absorb the raids and take the 
casualties rather than the israelis in return the israelis arm 
them pay the bills and keep them in power 
the militia backed by some 1200 israeli soldiers and hundreds 
of security agents man the socalled security zone a strip of 
lebanese territory that runs north of the border from the 
mediterranean coast in the west to the foothills of mount hermon in 
the east 
it costs israel 3 million a month to support the sla but for 
them its money well spent in the last 4 years nearly 200 
militia fighters have been killed and some 600 wounded defending 
israel in south lebanon where guerrillas fight among themselves as 
much as they do the israelis 
hundreds of palestinian guerrillas and lebanese leftist and 
moslem irregulars have been killed or wounded 
no israeli civilian has been slain in guerrilla raids from south 
lebanon since 1985 although the guerrillas still occasionally fire 
ineffectual rocket salvos into northern galilee 
still more than 30 israeli soldiers have been killed in the 
security zone since it was established in mid1985 that was when 
the israelis withdrew after three years of occupying a large chunk 
of lebanon harried all the way by suicide bombers and leftist and 
moslem guerrillas 
the zone 6 to 10 miles deep joins a finger of territory held 
by the sla that runs north to the christian mountain town of 
jezzine 15 miles above the israeli border 
israel pays the sla salaries and covers all our expenses 
says gen antoine lahd the silverhaired retired lebanese army 
officer who commands the sla israel provides us with all our 
needs we protect the zone and israels northern borders 
lahd a maronite catholic says his objective is a normal 
relationship of good neighborliness with israel theyre our 
neighbors we dont see any point in fighting them 
the israelis invaded lebanon in june 1982 because palestinians 
attacked them from lebanon he says 
its our duty to prevent anyone the palestinians iranians 
and others from using our land to attack israel lahd said in an 
interview at his heavily guarded villa in the slas headquarters 
complex in the mountain town of marjayoun 
this way we keep our land free and we avoid israeli reprisal 
attacks against terrorists on our land 
the israelis insist they do not want to stay in south lebanon 
the sla emerged from a group of christians armed by the israelis 
in 1976 to combat palestinian guerrillas lahd took over command of 
the sla in 1984 after its leader a renegade lebanese army major 
named saad haddad died of cancer 
lahd 62 was wounded in november 1988 when a woman member of 
the lebanese communist party who had a job as his wifes dance 
instructor shot him in an assassination attempt 
the lebanese government considers lahds force to be agents of 
the israelis who occupy lebanese territory and show no sign of 
withdrawing 
but one day when the middle east crisis is over and the 
problem of lebanon has been settled well be integrated into the 
regular lebanese armed forces lahd says given his cooperation 
with israel that remains to be seen 
the sla is armed with obsolete israeli tanks artillery and 
other weaponry much of it captured from the arabs lahd says the 
militia is divided into two brigades of 1500 fighters most of 
them deployed along the 72mile northern edge of the enclave

lahds spokesman caesar saqr says the zone was attacked 353 
times by infiltrators roadside bombs or artillery mortar and 
rocket bombardments last year almost one a day 
all the infiltration attempts were intercepted and dealt with 
in the security zone saqr says 
the sla fighters have a reputation for poor discipline and 
brutality most moslems and not a few christians consider them 
israeli mercenaries 
an sla private is paid 150 a month six times the average wage 
in other parts of lebanon and a second lieutenant gets 240 
lahd has sought to recruit shiites to give his army a sectarian 
mix but many of those defected 
the israelis say that better training by israeli instructors has 
improved the slas discipline and reliability 
the israelis in the zone are deployed primarily in strategic 
hilltop fire bases bristling with electronic surveillance equipment 
the israeli air force regularly attacks palestinian and lebanese 
guerrilla bases to avenge major attacks israeli troops with tanks 
and helicopter gunships often strike out of the zone on punitive 
raids seizing moslem suspects 
the israelis are not an occupation army lahd insists you 
dont see them in the streets or villages of the security zone 
they dont interfere with the population 
but shin beth israels security service operates in the zone 
along with an estimated 750 lebanese agents and informers un 
officials say 
most of the estimated 200000 people living in the 
328squaremile enclave are moslems the christians total only 
about 69000 and that makes them nervous 
their numbers have recently been swollen by some 20000 people 
who fled fighting in the christian enclave north of beirut 
many moslems believe that lahd with israels blessing seeks to 
turn the zone into a christian ministate a perpetual buffer bound 
economically to israel lahd and the israelis deny that 
the israelis and the sla impose tight restrictions to combat the 
guerrillas who include iranianbacked shiite moslem zealots 
prosyrian lebanese and communists 
at entry points into the zone on the lebanese side everyone is 
frisked even cigarette lighters are seized unless theyre the 
transparent plastic variety in case they contain electronic 
devices 
theres no official curfew but few people venture out at night 
you never know when youre going to get caught up in a gun 
battle between the sla and infiltrators said one christian who 
gave his name only as luftallah the israelis open fire 
immediately on drivers who dont pull over when their convoys are 
on the move 
like many other inhabitants of the zone he pays about 5 to 
anyone wholl ride with him for a day in his pickup truck 
distributing butane gas cylinders luftallah who hails from the 
village of qleiaam explained that every vehicle has to have at 
least two people in it because the israelis are afraid of suicide 
attacks 
the last such attack was on oct 20 1988 when a shiite zealot 
named abdallah atwi detonated his explosivespacked car as he drove 
past an israeli convoy killing himself and eight israelis 
the israelis have tried to set up civil administrations in 
the villages but many moslems refuse to recognize them 
the militiamen sometimes aided by shin beth agents regularly 
raid shiite and sunni moslem villages rounding up suspected 
guerrilla sympathizers 
the sla prison at khiam south of marjayoun holds some 350 arabs 
mostly lebanese shiites in the former french colonial fortress 
men who have been released from khiam claim that torture beatings 
and malnutrition are commonplace 
the inmates of khiam have become part of the longrunning drama 
of western hostages held by iranianbacked shiites in lebanon the 
kidnappers have said they will free hostages if israel releases the 
khiam prisoners many of whom have been held as long as some of the 
western captives

every morning some 2500 lebanese 
mostly women cross into israel through what they call the good 
fence to go to work 
to the lebanese government theyre traitors but for many of the 
200000 people living in the israelioccupied region of south 
lebanon working in the jewish state means survival 
the 1 million a month they earn is the economic lifeline for 
the region that has been shunned by lebanons central government 
since the israelis established the socalled security zone five 
years ago as a buffer against guerrilla attacks 
the government in beirut considers us collaborators with the 
enemy said a shiite moslem woman who gave her name only as 
zainab as she underwent security checks at kfar kila on her way to 
work as a maid at an israeli hotel 
beirut doesnt help us but they dont like us working in 
israel either we have no choice 
gen antoine lahd commander of the israeliarmed south lebanon 
army said if beirut sent us 1 million every month id stop 
anyone working in israel 
the israelis set up the fence in 1976 the year after lebanons 
civil war started when they began cooperating with southern 
christians to curb attacks by palestinian guerrillas based in the 
region 
the lebanese who work in israel earn an average 350 a month 
four times the minimum monthly wage set by the lebanese government 
most of the women work in hotel kitchens small factories or 
textile plants the men generally work as gardeners or in 
construction 
by allowing lebanese to work in the jewish state the israelis 
make the zone dependent on them economically but it also makes it 
easier to recruit men for the 3000strong sla which backed by 
some 1200 israeli soldiers blunts attacks by guerrillas 
only sla personnel can send a wife a mother or a member of 
their family to work in israel said a lebanese police officer 
who declined to be identified 
the zone is under constant attack by guerrillas while they have 
some support particularly among the shiite moslems many 
inhabitants of the zone wish the guerrillas would go away 
the israelis are my enemy said a schoolteacher who 
identified himself only as hassan but if we allow them to fight 
israel from here the israelis will employ scorched earth tactics 
the people who live here have nowhere to go 
the policeman is one of about 200 lebanese police officers who 
operate in the zone along with scores of administrative and 
educational personnel all local people 
we only have civil duties the officer said the israelis 
through their various agencies control political security 
deputy mayor mahfouz mahfouz of marjayoun the zones 
capital lamented 
were the forgotten ones the government doesnt send us 
anything not stationary heating fuel nothing i even had to buy 
the lebanese flag in my office with my own money

editors note in the world of horse racing hes remembered as 
the jockey aboard the royal horse that collapsed just before 
winning englands prestigious grand national in the publishing 
world hes known as the prolific author of nine bestsellers all 
set in the world he knows best meet dick francis royal jockey 
thriller writer 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
writers often deny that their novels 
are in any way autobiographical not dick francis the former royal 
jockey who is one of the worlds favorite thriller writers 
the main characters i use in my books are autobiographical 
francis says i am not as clever or brave as they are but they 
have my characteristics a lot 
not entirely of course francis has never been shot hunted 
down by a fleet of taxicabs or thrown off a balcony but the 
unvarying backdrop of his novels the world of horse racing is 
very much part of his previous life as a jockey 
francis newest hero is called john kendall and he is you 
guessed it a writer he appears in longshot francis 29th 
novel to be published in britain and the united states this fall 
things happen francis says impishly thats all im 
going to tell you 
francis was relaxing over a cup of coffee in the living room of 
folly house the lambourn stable and home of his horsetrainer son 
merrick it is big light and comfortable and filled with 
horseracing pictures and half a dozen affectionate dogs and cats 
as dick francis devotees ought to know this compact prosperous 
village in rolling berkshire about 60 miles west of london is the 
heart of english steeplechasing 
roofs are thatched hedges neat large bigeyed hunters 
clipclop along the twisting roads 
francis who lives in fort lauderdale fla was in england for 
the grand national englands if not the worlds greatest horse 
race its the one he never misses and the one he lost famously in 
1956 while riding the queen mothers devon loch the horse simply 
collapsed in the final strides with a clear field 
francis 69 is reserved among inquisitive strangers but polite 
and unpretentious for somebody who has sold more than 20 million 
books in 22 languages around the world 
at one point francis tried to cut down to one novel every two 
years but his publisher michael joseph ltd of london wouldnt 
have it 
the youngest of two sons francis was born into a horseracing 
family in south wales and rode a donkey at age 5 the first 
mount i had 
missing school regularly for hunts and competitions he left 
altogether at age 15 to help his father a horse dealer he wanted 
to be a jockey but his parents balked they knew all the trials 
and tribulations 
after world war ii in which he flew bombers francis became a 
gofer for a cheshire trainer george owen like his father he was 
too big for flat races but in that yard he became an amateur 
steeplechase rider and within 18 months went professional 
his riding career flourished and in 1953 francis joined trainer 
peter cazalets yard where queen mother elizabeth kept her horses 
cazalet gave him two bits of advice francis remembers vividly 
always ride to win and never look around in the final stretch 
francis became the queen mums no 1 jockey for four seasons and 
during the 19531954 season he realized one of his two great 
ambitions to be champion jockey by winning the most races that 
year 
the other to win the grand national proved more elusive 
francis blames devon lochs collapse on the stunning roar of the 
crowd excited by the prospect of the first royal win since 1900 
as i was in midair over the last jump i could hear this 
crescendo building up francis says i was just riding out with 
my hands and heels the horse just collapsed under me 
i had to get off him and walk away in disgust it was a 
terrible moment 
hurtling around courses francis broke his collarbone 12 times 
his nose five times his back his skull his wrist and numerous 
ribs 
as his bones took longer to knit he got out of racing on top 
in january 1957 he was 36 and in 10 years as a jockey had won a 
creditable 345 out of 2305 races 
he wrote his autobiography sport of queens and was racing 
correspondent for the daily express for 16 years 
his wife mary francis prodded him into writing his first novel 
to help pay for their two sons school fees and replace a 
threadbare carpet 
dead cert was published in 1962 and francis immediately 
found his formula a gallant idiosyncratic hero with a tie to 
horseracing a dirty deed as he calls it suspense some 
bonecrunching violence a little romance triumph over evil a 
bittersweet ending 
poet philip larkin once praised the absolute sureness of his 
settings the freshness of his characters the terrifying climaxes 
of violence the literate jauntiness of style the unfailing 
intelligent compassion 
more recently critics have occasionally found his powers 
flagging but to have pulled off nine bestsellers all set in the 
narrow world of horses is an unusual achievement since whip 
hand which was published in 1981 all his books have made the 
american bestseller list 
to broaden his field francis now focuses each novel on a 
specific subject diligently researched banking photography 
computers and takes his readers to new locations such as canada 
and the soviet union 
francis says he pays no attention to critics and he doesnt 
pretend to write great literature 
in 1986 the francises moved to a condominium in fort lauderdale 
because his wife who suffers from asthma could no longer tolerate 
the english climate francis visits england three times a year he 
usually begins a book in january finishes it in may and spends 
the rest of the year traveling and researching his next novel 
francis usually takes a long morning walk and goes for a swim 
then he writes by hand for five hours i like to see a sentence 
on a page see how it flows and finally copies his words into a 
word processor 
but writings rewards last longer winning a race theres the 
immediate satisfaction where people hit you on the back and say 
well done but you go out half an hour later and you go end over 
end he said 
but books are talked about he said nowadays its ah yes 
dick francis im known worldwide before it was dick francis 
the chap who didnt win the grand national

isabella hofmann who stars as kate on nbcs 
dear john likes to return to her hometown of chicago to do 
theater work 
in fact shes just back from a onemonth appearance at the 
goodman theatre in chekhovs uncle vanya 
chicago is one of the few remaining theater towns where the 
work and the process is important she says in hollywood the 
finished product is the most important thing a play is never 
finished its always growing 
it was wonderful to be back on the stage i hope i dont have 
to wait another two years before i do another play 
hofmann the daughter of german immigrants got her start on the 
stage in chicago and with the second city troupe 
dear john centers on the relationships of a group of 
divorced people who meet for support at the onetwoone club 
usually in an ensemble comedy the star is the calm center but judd 
hirsch as the john of the title can be as offthewall as the 
others kate is the calmest and most normal of the bunch 
i think kate is the character most people identify with 
says hofmann john is more quirky more of a victim kate is the 
most neutral i think people reflect on their own experiences 
through her 
the background of her character is that she put her husband 
through medical school and when he became a successful plastic 
surgeon he dumped her but beyond that very little is known about 
kate 
in the first season kate and john were romantically involved 
but the romance has cooled they are now just good friends 
the show also stars jane carr jere burns harry groener and 
billie bird susan walters will join the show in the fall season 
the comedy finished its first season last year in 11th place 
behind cheers on nbcs highly successful thursday comedy 
lineup in january nbc moved the show to wednesday and it ended 
the season in 18th place counting just its wednesday appearances 
it was in 27th place 
nbcs official explanation for the move was to bolster the 
wednesday night ratings which it has unofficially the move was 
to make room for grand a new show from carseywerner 
productions makers of nbcs monster hit the cosby show 
the series is the first for hofmann who had made guest 
appearances in such shows as head of the class matlock 
night court and beauty and the beast shed also been in 
several movies of the week and the theatrical movie real men 
what got her out of chicago was a role in an nbc movie pilot 
called independence 
i played an irish immigrant who ran a boarding house for 
miners she says it was a western that we made in santa fe 
nm john bennett perry played the sheriff i learned to ride a 
horse i went out with the wranglers every morning 
next she worked in the movie real men and was in an episode of 
head of the class then she didnt work for six months 
hofmann had a series development deal with mtm enterprises my 
contract was almost up she says i wrote a treatment they were 
interested in then the script for dear john sort of happened at 
my agents office it was so funny i wanted to do it apparently 
they had been reading people for the role it happened very 
quickly 
after she did the pilot and was waiting for the network pickup 
she married actor steven memel 
stevens an actor musician writer so many things she 
says we met while doing a play in chicago isaac beshevis 
singers teibele and her demon 
her husband is also just back from doing a play he spent 2 
months performing in tamara in italy

shows in high school i liked it when i graduated i enrolled at 
the city college of san francisco as a drama major 
within two years i was in new york a lot of my friends went 
south to los angeles to movies i didnt want to do that i always 
wanted to be in the theater 
the first thing bryggman auditioned for in new york was a soap 
opera to replace an actor who was going to vietnam they said 
theyd hire him but he should check with his draft board he did 
and his induction papers had been mailed that day he spent the 
next two years in the army 
back in new york in 1969 his agent sent him to read for an 
under five on as the world turns that means less than 
five lines he explains 
when the under five became far more than five my attitude 
and my agents attitude was it was a good parttime job that i 
needed to make enough money to support my hobby which is the 
theater 
this tv show has been good for me ive not had to go to 
california to live 
before prelude to a kiss opened on may 1 bryggman was 
banquo in shakespeares macbeth at the public theater joe 
papp called my agent and offered me the job he says 
i thought have i finally reached that magical place where i 
dont have to audition any more i dont think thats true 
bryggman played one of the tribunes one of the slick guys 
who went around and caused all the trouble in coriolanus 
directed by steven berkoff 
in the basic training of pavlo hummel al pacino and i had 
the whole first act he recalls but i wasnt in the second act 
at all 
he also was in pacinos richard iii on broadway 
bryggman played pozzo in an offbroadway production of waiting 
for godot for six months 
a year ago bryggman had a 56minute monologue in terrence 
mcnallys prelude and liebestod offoffbroadway a conductor 
speaks his thoughts while conducting tristan und isolde he 
hopes itll be done again next season offbroadway 
bryggman whose name is swedish is a member of the 
offoffbroadway manhattan class company which staged prelude 
and liebestod we take a play from its early draft and stay 
with it right on through he says its great to work with the 
playwright i like working on new material i like the attitude and 
spirit there 
in his personal life bryggman has two exwives and three 
children a daughter 29 who works for home box office in 
california a son 24 studying film scoring at the berklee college 
of music in boston and a son 20 installing burglar alarms on long 
island 
he lives in manhattan with a scotch terrier and has a 30acre 
farm with 10 acres in crops in upstate new york i try to take 
care of it myself he says another fellow helps me with 
plowing and cutting 
we do a sunday matinee and i get to the farm about 8 i jump 
on the tractor and cut a back field by 1030 with the lights on i 
get up at 6 monday and start work finishing by 7 that evening 
the neighbors all must stand around and laugh the crazy

a preoccupation with treating alcoholism in 
younger people has obscured a serious and neglected problem among 
old people in this country experts say 
alcoholism in the elderly is drastically underdetected and 
undertreated said nancy j osgood a medical college of virginia 
gerontologist we have a hard time thinking a person 85 years old 
could have an alcohol problem 
ms osgood and officials of the virginia department for the 
aging have developed what they say is the nations first statewide 
program to detect alcoholism in the elderly 
about 100 twomember teams of volunteers will receive a day of 
intensive training from the state and each team in turn will train 
125 people the first training session was in february another is 
set for september 
the goal is to have 12500 relatives of older alcoholics older 
adults and social service and health professionals versed in the 
physical and psychological effects of alcohol and aging 
delaware is setting up a detection program using virginia as a 
model ms osgood said 
rita albery a public health adviser to the national institute 
on alcohol abuse and alcoholism said the focus has been on 
alcoholism in younger people but not in older people 
weve got to start paying attention to this population she 
said 
studies have found that 2 percent to 10 percent of americans 
over 65 are alcoholics or 560000 to 28 million people but the 
statistics are misleading because the problem is largely 
undetected said ms osgood 
the elderly dont usually come in contact with work officials 
or even with family members because they live alone she said 
many older people also grew up believing alcoholism was a moral 
issue instead of a chronic disease and that overcoming it was a 
matter of will power this makes it hard for older people to seek 
help 
its sometimes difficult for physicians to distinguish symptoms 
of alcoholism such as memory loss and blackouts from the 
natural aging process ms osgood said many physicians also are 
reluctant to recognize alcoholism in the elderly or to confront an 
older patient she said 
elderly alcoholics themselves can make diagnosis difficult 
alcoholics can hide it from anybody its a real hidden 
disease said ms osgood who has written extensively on 
geriatric alcoholism depression and suicide 
a more insidious barrier to detecting and treating alcoholism 
among the elderly is an attitude of the bottle is the only thing 
they have left why take it away from them ms osgood said 
theyre really the ones we should be taking it away from 
j james cotter director for program development and management 
for the department for the aging agreed 
there is a tendency to use age as a justification for not 
seeking stronger intervention and providing help he said 
taken to a further extreme some people believe why treat it 
theyre going to die anyway ms osgood said its a crazy kind 
of rationalization 
among the clues to alcoholism in the elderly are repeated falls 
gaps in memory confusion a flushed face trembling weight loss 
extreme fatigue incontinence aggressive or abusive behavior and 
depression 
the goals of intervention are to allow a person to become aware 
of the problem to build the alcoholics motivation to recover and 
to help the alcoholic overcome fears of the disease and treatment 
intervention may take only a single meeting or many visits over a 
period of months 
an irony of the failure to detect alcoholism in old people is 
that they have a better treatment prognosis than other age groups 
ms osgood said 
most geriatric alcoholism is related to a specific problem 
crisis or stress related to aging rather than to a lifetime of 
drinking she said 
still elderly alcoholics are more at risk for associated 
illnesses such as liver damage and gastrointestinal problems 
because their bodies are weaker 
another physical threat is the sometimes lethal reaction between 
alcohol and prescription drugs 
cotter said geriatric alcoholism will worsen as life expectancy 
increases 
its going to cost a fortune to take care of elderly 
alcoholics ms osgood said the drain on social services and 
the health care system in terms of money will be extremely high 
the human cost in terms of quality of life will be even 
higher she said ms osgood said she believes the increase in 
elderly suicides is tied to alcoholism although there has been no 
definitive research on the subject 
as with geriatric suicide alcoholism among the elderly 
primarily targets men male alcoholics make up 88 percent of the 
elderly who are receiving treatment 
in our society men more than women have held positions of 
power status and authority so when they become old and lose their 
jobs and income and the status and power theyve got the farthest 
to fall ms osgood said 
social history may also make alcoholism harder to spot among 
elderly women 
i think we probably have many more women alcoholics than 
weve recognized because traditionally we havent even had programs 
for women alcoholics she said as a society we say nice women 
dont drink we dont want to admit that our grandmother is an 
alcoholic

an estimated 3 percent of americas older 
population have been called the sheltered generation mentally 
retarded senior citizens who outlive their parents 
were not prepared said john stokesbury director of the 
university of miamis center on aging and developmental 
disabilities the professional and social service community is 
not prepared to suddenly deal with someone who is orphaned at age 
60 
long before the 1960s push for special education parents chose 
whether to send their children to an insane asylum or keep them 
home many families who kept their children at home dealt little 
with the social service system and havent planned for their own 
deaths 
in florida social service agencies are aware of 1500 adults 
with any of about 200 lifelong developmental disabilities ranging 
from downs syndrome to autism to cerebral palsy but some social 
service workers believe the actual population is closer to 15000 
many of these parents realize theres a problem they never 
thought their child would outlive them said stokesbury a state 
social service worker and administrator for 18 years the doctors 
said their children wouldnt live past their teens but they did 
many developmentally disabled people are susceptible to 
respiratory diseases but antibiotics virtually eliminated 
pneumonia as a fatal illness congenital heart problems were 
repaired with surgery lifespans were stretched 
an increasing focus on the aging of american society drew 
attention to this overlooked group and pushed federal agencies for 
the aging and developmentally disabled last year to jointly fund 
research work for the first time 
at the university of miamis medical school the center is 
trying to identify the sheltered generation born from the 1920s 
to 1940s develop an advocacy program and train professionals to 
deal with them 
the center is asking home meal delivery groups churches 
physicians and others with direct family contact to help 
parents can be briefed on guardianship and financial planning to 
ease their children through the emotional crisis of their deaths 
the big problems are accessibility to adequate appropriate 
and affordable health care because theres not a critical mass of 
physicians trained in gerontology and developmental disabilities 
stokesbury said the majority of doctors treating mentally 
retarded adults are pediatricians 
adult daycare has become relatively common for the elderly but 
stokesbury said there is opposition to accepting developmentally 
disabled clients in the same programs 
researchers nationally are looking at legal issues recreation 
and leisure activities training programs and special concerns for 
rural elderly to produce some policy direction

my wife virginia and i were born in the 1920s 
she never had a glimpse of her grandparents i have vague 
recollections of one my mothers father who died when i was 5 
now susan and michael springer of canyon country calif have 
anounced we are to become greatgrandparents after the spontaneous 
outrush of joy the full implication of the aging of america 
smashed in and if two kids who began dating in high school get the 
chance what lasting impression do virigina and i want to leave 
with our first greatgrandchild 
my reporters instincts always have been tantalizied by the 
lives of my grandparents if only i could have interviewed them 
anders valter the name was changed to andrew walters at ellis 
island was 39 when he left sweden in the 1880s with a wife and 
three daughters two children were born in this country including 
my dad i have the 15inch jardiniere grandmother mathilda brought 
with her what would induce her to take such an impractical but 
beautiful piece of porcelain in the 10 cubic feet of steerage 
luggage allowed the family did my grandfather know before they 
left 
anders erikson my maternal grandfather who became andrew w 
ericson came alone from sweden about the same time i have his 
contract of passage he paid 3574 in us currency for that he 
was assured he would sail in steerage by way of england to new york 
city and be carried by train to porter ind all this with good 
and sufficient food and hotel accommodations where called for 
in 1892 he won a gold medal at the worlds fair i have a 
postal card apparently as mass advertisement showing him and his 
refrigerator an ornate box using ice for the coolant 
his wife emma was born at porter her death at 42 rated a 
long frontpage story in the daily newspaper at michigan city 
ind where the ericsons and walters then lived but the story 
also among my possessions says only that she was known for many 
good works in the community without specifying 
when our parents were born around the turn of this century life 
expectancy was about 50 years today its 75 many chldren know 
their grandparents some their greatgrandparents 
however the mother of virginias mother died from complications 
of childbirth the father died a few years later my future 
motherinlaw was raised by relatives those three events were 
common at that time my wifes father immigrated from poland 
virginia remembers receiving small packages of polish hard candy 
once a year from her grandmother until world war ii began nothing 
afterward 
virginias dad was fluent in eight languages including russian 
german and polish in indiana he managed a factory but he was 
vague about poland and the reason for his linguistic skills was he 
involved in revolutionary activities and had to flee for his life 
as a relative later told me 
except for vital statistics such as birth marriage and death 
records thats about all i can tell my grandchildren three boys 
and three girls of their greatgrandparents will my 
greatgrandchild want to hear my stories i can hardly wait 
actually my own greatgrandad may have warned me against 
smoking marijuana im going to check courthouse records to see if 
i can find out when i visit indiana later this summer as a 
youngster i went to porter often to visit grandpa swanson my 
grandmother emmas maiden name was swanson so he could have been 
her father he couldnt have been my grandfather family lines were 
blurred in those days and most of us had dozens of aunts and 
uncles 
once in a while he would tell stories about the civil war or 
indians on rare occasions he would take a troop of youngsters for 
short walks on one he pointed to a weed growing alongside a ditch 
on his farm and said something like this 
years ago when the pottawatomie indians lived around here 
they would sit around their evening campfire and some would smoke 
this now i know you boys and girls are going to try smoking 
sometime its not a good idea but if you do stick to cornsilks 
and tobacco the indians who smoked this stuff would go real 
crazy 
maybe it was because his delivery was so impressive maybe we 
were so impressionable but so far as i know none of us ever tried 
a swedish immigrant he also told of fighting with the indiana 
volunteers at gettysburg arriving by forced march on the third day 
of the battle 
there were bodies in blue and gray uniforms all over he 
said the smell was terrible the flies came from miles away 
thousands of them the army fed us hardtack spread with honey at 
first we tried to pick them off but two would land for every one 
we picked off finally we gave up and ate it flies and all 
years later i went to gettysburg and stood where he must have 
been it was beautiful and peaceful but in my mind all i could see 
where hungry soldiers eating flycovered honey and crackers 
i never have been sure of his first name but each fourth of 
july when i was a boy he would dress in his blue uniform and ride 
at or near the head of the local parade once at the cemetery i 
saw tears flood down his cheeks when the bugler played taps

for many of us going to the hospital is 
somewhat like traveling to a foreign country the sights are not 
familiar the language sounds strange and the people wear unusual 
costumes 
no matter what the reason for the trip whether its an 
overnight visit for tests or a longer stay for medical treatment or 
major surgery entering the hospital may be worrisome 
in my experience knowing about hospitals and the people who 
work there and planning can make the trip less stressful 
the following hints are meant especially for those who know in 
advance theyll be going to the hospital and therefore have time to 
prepare relatives and friends of people who are admitted to a 
hospital because of an emergency also may find this information 
useful 
take as little as possible with you however be sure to pack 
the following a list of the medicines you are taking prescription 
and nonprescription drugs details of past illnesses surgeries 
and any allergies your health insurance card telephone numbers of 
relatives to contact in an emergency and a few personal items such 
as nightclothes toothbrush toothpaste shampoo and deodorant 
leave money jewelry including wedding rings and watches 
credit cards and checkbooks at home or have a family member or 
friend keep them if you must take valuables ask if they can be 
kept in the hospital safe 
if possible ask a relative or friend to go with you to the 
hospital for support 
while there youll have an attending physician who directs 
your overall care in a teaching hospital youll also be treated 
by medical students and residents doctors who have graduated from 
medical school and are continuing their training 
registered nurses licensed practical nurses and aides give 
medicines check your blood pressure and provide other services 
physical occupational and respiratory therapists also may be 
involved in your care as well as the hospital dietition 
pharmicist and social worker 
in some hospitals a team that includes a doctor a nurse a 
social worker and other specialists performs a thorough review and 
examination called a geriatric assessment to learn about your 
physical and mental health family life income living 
arrangements access to community services and ability to perform 
daily tasks such as dressing and preparing meals 
the team not only diagnoses health problems but also develops a 
plan to make sure you receive appropriate health care and social 
services on a continuing basis 
before leaving the hospital you can arrange for home care a 
service called discharge planning is offered in the hospital so 
that if needed a visiting nurse hospital equipment mealson 
wheels or other services will be there when you go home 
the discharge planner also knows about senior centers nursing 
homes and other longterm care facilities in your community 
in the event of a serious illness or accident its vital to 
seek medical help right away in many areas you can reach 
emergency help by calling 911 or the telphone operator be sure to 
tell the operator the type of emergency and your location 
if you have a minor injury or your symptoms arent severe call 
your doctor or a nearby clinic before going to the emergency room 
sometimes an emergency room visit isnt necessary if it is your 
doctor can make things easier by calling the hospital to let them 
know youre coming your doctor also may arrange to meet you there 
if theres time try to take your health insurance card or 
policy number your doctors name and telephone number a list of 
the medicines you take information about other medical problems 
and the telephone numbers of close relatives 
its helpful to record and keep this information on a note card 
you can carry in your wallet or purse if you have a particular 
medical problem such as diabetes epilepsy or allergies you should 
wear an id bracelet or necklace or carry an id card to let rescue 
workers and hospital personnel know about these conditions 
the national institute on aging distributes free information on 
topics including hospital hints finding good medical care 
for older americans and whos who in health care these 
publications are available from the nia information center po

as time goes by some of us become 
shortcut gardeners happy to have found ways to lighten the work 
load and still enjoy the fruits of the soil 
viewed from this angle the novice toils unnecessarily with 
spade and hoe machinery heavy bags of fertilizer the veteran 
lets nature do much of the work 
back in the 1950s a connecticut gardener named ruth stout wrote 
a book called how to have a green thumb without an aching back 
which became the bible of the lazy gardener basically what ms 
stout did was to cover her vegetable garden with a permanent 
eightinch layer of hay and dump her daily kitchen scraps on top of 
that 
ms stout a sister of detective story writer rex stout also 
tossed leaves grass clippings uprooted weeds and other plant 
wastes on the pile all of which gradually decayed and turned into 
rich topsoil the thick cover called mulch also stifled weeds 
when planting ms stout pushed aside the mulch and after the 
seeds sprouted pulled it back around the seedlings 
the process goes all year round in winter the kitchen garbage 
gets tossed on the snow this is organic gardening with a 
vengeance in effect your compost heap is your garden so you 
dont have to build up and keep a separate compost heap 
practitioners never have to turn up the soil in fall or spring 
never have to pull up a weed 
now grateful as we are to ms stout not all of us want to look 
at banana peels on the snow out in the county where i live my 
vegetable garden is the first thing people see when they come up 
the drive my wife is great for vegetables sun most of the day 
and good drainage on a slight slope but she draws a line at 
eggshells and coffee grains 
sacrificing the garbage a mulch gardener can still achieve 
pretty much the same results with a deep cover of leaves grass 
clippings and with money bales of salt hay available at 
nurseries the yellow hay makes a pretty background for the 
vegetables wood ashes or lime occasionally mixed in with the 
leaves insure against the danger of acidity 
having eliminated tilling and weeding a lazy gardener soon 
finds additional ways to reduce work the plants themselves will 
help if you know the ones you can count on perennials like 
asparagus and rhubarb need only the initial planting after that 
they come up year after year all you do is harvest them 
most vegetables are annuals however needing to be sowed anew 
every year of those broccoli is my ideal laborsaving crop 
planted early in spring in my southern new york garden broccoli 
produces a large head in late june or early july after this is 
harvested the plant keeps yielding side shoots or florets deep 
into the frosts of fall with little or no attention fro me and 
broccoli ranks high on nutrition charts a powerhouse of vitamins 
and minerals 
i save much work by letting tomatoes sprawl on the salt hay 
instead of staking them and i include a few tomatoes of 
indeterminate varieties like yellow pear which yield all season 
long instead of all at once pole limas unlike the bush varieties 
also keep yielding until frost 
many lettuces respond well to cutandcomeagain harvesting at 
maturity you cut the plant at near soil level and the stump will 
come back and give you another harvest plants like swiss chard and 
new zealand spinach also are seasonlong performers a fine beet is 
winter keeper it can stay in the ground for months and never lose 
its flavor 
a gardener who prefers his exercise on the tennis court or golf 
course also learns to plant sparingly nine tomato plants will do 
handsomely who needs to lug baskets of produce out of the garden 
and then try to give them away to the neighbors

older americans who acquired their buying 
habits in a more trusting era are less knowledgeable than the 
young about their rights as consumers a survey shows 
the survey conducted for the american association of retired 
persons shows that while 62 percent of people under 65 believe 
businesses try to mislead consumers at least half the time only 44 
percent of older people say that is true 
of those older than 65 only 36 percent said they knew a buyer 
has several days to cancel a purchase made from a doortodoor 
sales person and only 28 percent said they knew consumers are not 
liable for all charges to a stolen credit card prior to notifying 
the company 
older consumers buying habits were formed during a time when 
a more trusting relationship existed between the sellers and buyers 
of goods and services said horace b deets the associations 
executive director 
to this extent older consumers are at a disadvantage in 
dealing with some of todays business practices he said 
the survey was conducted by telephone with 1305 people ages 25 
to over 85

the study on racerelated differences among the elderly was 
supported by the national institute on aging and is reported in the 
july issue of the journal of gerontology social sciences 
the study involved 1598 urban dwellers aged 65 and over 
initial interviews were conducted in 1975 and 645 survivors were 
reinterviewed in 1984 
although interviewers rated elderly whites as more physically 
impaired 409 percent to 312 percent blacks rated their own

popular sheet music issued in the united 
states from 1830 to 1980 shows a clear preference for youth and 
often portrays the elderly with fear concern and ridicule a study 
shows 
reviewing more than 15000 pieces of sheet music and titles 
reviewers elias s cohen and anna l kruschwitz of the community 
services institute inc of narbeth pa said a substantial 
majority of those dealing specifically with the elderly showed them 
in a distinctly negative light 
old age is seen more as a time of failing capacities and 
diminished status than as a time of fulfillment and the golden 
years cohen said 
fear of old age he said is seen in such titles as the 
withered tree issued in 1850 and 1874s over the hill to the 
poor house 
the cover art illustrating many pieces of sheet music shows an 
exaggerated view of age the study said 
in happy family polka written in 1851 grandchildren of no 
more than 8 or 9 years old are shown the parents appear to be in 
their early 30s but the grandparents who logically would be in 
their 50s are shown as they would appear in their 70s or 80s

democratic rep james mcclure clarke is being 
cast by the republican party as one of the worst violators of the 
public trust in the savings and loan crisis 
why the north carolina lawmaker voted last year to let the 
industry continue investing in junk bonds so did 113 other house 
members none of whom were criticized for that on the gop hit list 
clarke is one of the politicians caught in the crossfire as 
democrats develop the theme they hope to ride to the white house in 
1992 and republicans respond with fusillades of their own 
the result is a spotlight on a handful of house members facing 
the voters this fall and some of them arent too happy about the 
escalating party rhetoric 
making a political football of it is not going to solve the 
problem said rep charles pashayan rcalif his democratic 
challenger consulted with party strategists in washington and came 
out swinging on sampls 
frankly from my standpoint there is enough blame to go 
around to everybody said rep doug barnard of georgia one of 
the democrats on the gop list in all fairness they ought to 
take that off the board both democrats and republicans 
both parties acknowledge a few members of congress are 
vulnerable on sampls but the democrats arent about to softpedal a 
promising national strategy and the republicans cant take the 
assault lying down 
to me this is apples and oranges said democratic party 
chairman ronald brown on the one hand you have accusations 
against individuals on the other you have the question of whose 
policies allowed this mess to happen and there is no doubt in my 
mind that this happened because of republican economic policies 
the democrats though taking a broadbrush approach are not 
ignoring individual republicans with sampl problems pashayan is one 
example 
the fresno congressman is under fire for trying to block 
restrictions on risky thrift investments and taking 26000 in 
contributions from former sampl operator charles keating and his 
friends pashayan said his actions have not been influenced by 
samplrelated contribution but he returned the money 
the national gop strategy has been to defend president bushs 
handling of the 300 billionplus bailout and when provoked point 
fingers at congress and individual democrats 
the republican national committee hastily compiled its list of 
10 alleged violators of the public trust after learning that 
brown was launching an sampl offensive at a june 2930 meeting of 
state party chairmen 
among those named were the four democrats among the keating five 
senators under investigation for accepting hundreds of thousands 
of dollars from keating and his sampl associates then allegedly 
lobbying regulators to keep his failing sampl open none of the five 
is up for reelection this year 
the gop case against barnard and rep frank annunzio dill 
both keating beneficiaries and heads of subcommittees dealing with 
sampls is that they protected the industry while the crisis was 
developing both deny it 
rep steve neal dnc made the list for sponsoring a 1987 
amendment that republicans claimed was too nice to sampls he 
disputes the interpretation and says hes targeted because his 
reelection races are always tough 
theyre going to try this stuff to confuse the issue and pass 
the buck but ultimately they cannot do it because it was their 
main philosophy said neal another banking subcommittee 
chairman it was a conscious decision on their part not to 
supervise this industry 
neals republican opponent didnt raise the sampl issue until the 
gop list appeared but neal says the democrats should stay on the 
offensive even if he gets hit by a stray shot 
they ought to tell the truth about it and let the chips fall 
where they may he said he added i dont feel caught in it 
myself anything they say about me on this they are saying the 
same thing about a whole lot of republicans 
clarke who is not involved with banking policy appeared to be 
on the sampl list because he won his last race by just 1529 votes 
we were automatically destined for the republican hit list and 
always have been so they fished around for this samplrelated 
thing said terry garren clarkes administrative assistant 
garren said they should have fished around for something else 
he said the same type of ammunition can be used against clarkes 
republican challenger charles taylor a banker 
i guarantee you positively just like federal express that 
theyre going to hear about it garren promised

this is a very important week in economic 
affairs not just because of the economic summit in houston but 
because the weeks dosage of key indicators will be released on 
friday the 13th 
sensible people understand that the coincidence doesnt ensure 
the figures will be bad but such a degree of uncertainty exists 
these days that you cannot be complacent securities markets have 
been shaken by less 
uncertainty is the enemy of economic progress it is a malady 
made worse in modern times by computers that spit out positive data 
one day negative the next it is the allpurpose explanation for 
lethargy in securities markets 
these days it reigns over all 
it rises just before budget deficit or trade figures are 
released and it is exacerbated every time a statement is released 
about the progress of trade talks with japan will the japanese 
live up to their agreements 
the celebration over politicaleconomic events in europe is 
muted by the uncertainty of what might follow it rises every time 
another blue chip company reports a decline in earnings as many of 
them have been doing lately 
uncertainty received a megashot in recent days when president 
bush indicated he might renege on what had been a nearcertainty 
that the phrase tax increase would not escape his lips will 
he or wont he 
and will alan greenspan chairman of the federal reserve board 
allow interest rates to fall as so many wall street analysts have 
been forecasting or perish the thought might he allow them to 
rise as some analysts fear 
theres that savings and loan fiasco to deal with it might be 
the ultimate statistical uncertainty what had been thought to be a 
50 billion disaster then a 500 billion catastrophe might become 
a trilliondollar tragedy 
hearing this an unnerved financial analyst was thought to say 
something to the effect that you havent heard anything yet some 
banks and insurers he said are in bad shape they might survive 
he said but you cant be certain 
all these concerns must be viewed in the context of the 
allencompassing macro uncertainty which is whether the economy 
will fall into recession or instead grow slightly or perhaps even 
embark on a boom 
who really knows 
what is known is that you can never be certain that interest 
rates and prices will fall in a recession no matter what economic 
theory states 
and you are warned almost every day if the economy expands 
instead then higher prices and higher interest rates are a real 
threat 
if weather reports were issued this way everyone would run for 
cover but most people hear the bad news forecasts of storms to 
come and simply take an umbrella with them some just smile and 
sometimes the weather smiles back 
it is different with economic forecasts you must think 
dismal theres a statistical threat a day and even the 
brightest indicators carry caveat asterisks as if every 
fairweather cumulus was a developing tornado 
well said an analyst you cant be 100 percent certain it 
isnt

louisianas abortion bill isnt the only 
piece of restrictive legislation facing gov buddy roemer who also 
must decide whether to sign a bill to require warning labels on 
records 
roemer said today that he favors warning labels for recordings 
with themes of rape murder suicide incest illegal drug use 
child abuse and satanic worship but would prefer that the industry 
adopt a voluntary program 
the legislature passed legislation saturday requiring warning 
labels on recordings with those themes and banning sales to minors 
at a news conference roemer said he had serious legal questions 
about the constitutionality of the labeling bill but he said he 
did not know yet whether he would sign or veto the measure 
roemer said most of the recording industry was acting 
responsibly but some portions of the industry produce pure 
trash parents dont know that until they are brought home and 
played he said 
roemer said he preferred a voluntary program similar to he 
ratings system adopted by the movie industry well all be better 
off he said 
in may the recording industry unveiled a voluntary labeling 
system that it hoped would halt campaigns in some states for 
mandatory labeling the program became effective this month and 
labeled recordings already are showing up in stores said mike 
cutshaw an attorney representing the national association of 
recording merchandisers 
the house voted 799 to concur with senate amendments to the 
bill by rep ted haik and sent it to roemer for his signature or 
veto 
although the bill passed both chambers with more than the 
twothirds vote needed to override a veto the regular session ends 
tonight and roemer has 20 days to decide on the bill after it 
reaches his desk if he vetoes the bill that would effectively 
kill it unless there were a special session called 
karen knowles the head of the louisiana music commission which 
promotes the states music industry said the panel was concerned 
because of the potential economic effect the bill could have 
knowles said she had discussed the bill with the governor but he 
did not say whether he would sign it 
thomas casey roemers executive counsel said sunday that the 
bill would be studied carefully before the governor makes a 
decision 
already the producers of the grammy awards show have said such 
a law would scuttle louisianas chances of being host of the event 
also backers of a proposed grammy hall of fame in new orleans say 
the law would end their project at a cost to the citys depressed 
economy estimated by some at 100 million 
under the legislation record manufacturers would be required to 
label recordings with objectionable lyrics retailers would be 
subject to misdemeanor criminal penalties for selling labeled 
recordings to those under 17 
jay berman president of the recording industry association of 
america said most state legislatures considering such bills had 
backed down since the industry announced its plans for voluntary 
labeling 
last week capitol records promised to provide legal help to 
store operators threatened with arrest for selling its recordings 
that bear labels warning consumers of sexually explicit lyrics 
haik said he pushed the bill to force the recording industry to 
follow through on longstanding promises to institute a voluntary 
labeling system 
this is designed to make the industry put its money where its 
mouth is said sen mike foster a supporter of the labeling bill 
the legislation would not take effect until 1992 haik has said 
that if the recording industry implements its voluntary program he 
would push for repeal of the law 
cutshaw said a labeling law would not keep objectionable 
recordings out of the hands of youths since older siblings and 
friends could make the purchases for them instead the law would 
be a nightmare for retailers he said

under a bright sunny sky 29 
solarpowered cars designed and built by college students today 
began a 1600mile race from florida to detroit mich in efforts 
to prove a future technology 
the start of the 11day race sponsored by the department of 
energy the society of automative engineers and general motors was 
led by the first three qualifiers from the univerities of 
maryland michigan and mankato state in minnesota 
we hope young people will get excited about this race and 
that it serves as an incentive for future technology said gm 
president bob stemple in ceremonies before the start 
thirtytwo cars entered the competition but arizona state had 
problems with its brakes and gears and was scratched from the first 
days start organizers said that car will start up on the second 
leg of the race and be penalized for the lost time 
winners will be determined by adding up the times it takes to 
complete each days leg of the race 
two other cars had trouble getting away immediately but were 
expected to leave later in the day they were the entries from the 
unversity of north texas and rosehulman institute of technology in 
indiana 
the cars powered only by the sun and storage batteries will 
travel over secondary roads in florida georgia alabama 
tennessee kentucky indiana ohio and michigan 
they are headed for a july 19 finish at the general motors 
technical center in warren mich a suburb outside the motor city 
the combination of direct sunlight and stored energy can propel 
some of the vehicles at high speeds for limited distances but the 
cars must abide by posted speed limits 
nevertheless the students want to win the top two finishers 
and a third selected for technological innovations will be sent by 
gm to compete in the 1990 world solar challenge race in australia 
later this year 
each car was conceived designed and built from the ground 
up by some of north americas top engineering and science 
students said gm vice president donald l runkle 
some of the cars cost more than 250000 and took more than a 
year to build 
entries come from schools including mit stanford the 
university of michigan florida institute of technology viginia 
polytechnic institute the university of pennsylvania 
waterlooontario and puerto ricomayaguez 
gm selected the 32 entries in april 1989 after considered more 
than 100 schools and 60 detailed design proposals 
sunlight is the only power source but battery charging from the 
cars solar array is allowed daily in the morning and late 
afternoon 
each of the 32 schools received 5000 from general motors and 
2000 from the us department of energy as seed money but each 
each car cost thousands more to build

the federal maritime commission said monday it 
has reached a settlement with several shipping lines operating in 
the pacific that allegedly charged less for cargo than their 
published rates 
the agency said it would not disclose the names of the companies 
or the amount of money they will pay until aug 28 but a statement 
released by the commission said the companies will make the largest 
monetary payment to the maritime commission in its 29year history 
we realized from the beginning that only a strong deterrent 
would prevent unlawful practices in pacific trade acting 
commission chairman james j carey said in the statement this 
agreement goes a long way toward assuring future compliance with 
the shipping act of 1984 
the largest previous settlement with the commission was 4 
million made in the late 1970s said seymour glanzer director of 
the agencys bureau of hearing counsel glanzer declined in a 
telephone interview to reveal the identity of the companies how 
many are involved whether they are us or foreign lines and the 
amount of money in the settlement 
violations of the shipping act or commission regulations can 
result in penalties of up to 25000 per shipment 
a source familiar with the agreement said it involved between 
four and 10 companies 
the companies allegedly charged rates to ship cargo that were 
less than the official tariffs they had previously filed with the 
commission glanzer said 
in addition to paying the penalties the settlement requires 
them to fully disclose alleged wrongful or questionable rate 
practices including rebates and inaccurate descriptions of cargo 
the companies also have agreed to participate in a new 
compliance accord that involves stronger policing of cargo rates by 
the shipping industry 
a similar settlement covering cargo trade in the atlantic for 
2 million took effect in 1987

nike inc vaulted ahead of all worldwide 
competitors last year the company said monday in reporting an 84 
percent leap in its fourthquarter profit 
chairman philip h knight said at a meeting with securities 
analysts in new york that nike intends to enhance its position by 
working to boost its already strong business outside the united 
states 
he announced that the company earned 672 million or 177 a 
share in the three months ended may 31 up from 365 million or 
97 cents a share a year earlier revenue rose 47 percent to 609 
million from 4134 million 
profit for nikes entire 1990 fiscal year rose 45 percent to 
24296 million or 642 a share from 16705 million or 445 a 
share in 1989 annual revenue rose 31 percent to 224 billion 
from 1989s 171 billion 
in 1990 nike became the largest sports and fitness footwear 
and apparel company in the world knight said we have 
accomplished this by marketing a wide range of quality in a variety 
of sport categories built on a foundation of truly innovative 
performance technology 
nike nosed out adidas ag the west german manufacturer for the 
top spot among athletic shoemakers the company based its claim to 
the no 1 ranking on global sales of the nike brand and said it 
also was the leader in terms of profitability 
in the united states alone nike estimates that it holds about 
28 percent of the market its closest competitors reebok 
international inc and la gear inc hold 22 percent and 12 
percent of the us market respectively 
sales of nike brand goods worldwide last year surpassed adidas 
sales excluding sales of nonadidas brand merchandise owned by the 
adidas group and revenue from licensed merchandise as a 
privatelyheld company adidas doesnt regularly report its results 
it has previously been reported that adidas had revenue last year 
of about 28 billion including licensing revenue 
thomas clarke nikes vice president of marketing said the 
practice of including revenue from licensed merchandise 
artificially inflates the total he said nike calculates that 
actual sales of the adidas brand alone were about 16 billion last 
year vs about 21 billion for nike 
adidas has been losing market share for years and reportedly 
lost about 90 million last year it was announced over the weekend 
that french entrepreneur bernard tapie will buy an 80 percent stake 
in adidas tapie promised to return adidas to profitability by next 
year 
the change in adidas ownership will not upset nikes strategy 
to dominate the world sports shoe business said richard k 
donahue nike president and chief operating officer 
we see them as not being in our league donahue said 
describing adidas as a hasbeen troubled company 
nike based in beaverton ore plans to become more aggressive 
in promoting its products overseas it will inaugurate its first 
globally coordinated advertising campaign with the launch next 
spring of the air 180 a new model of running shoe incorporating 
the latest developments in nikes airsole cushioning 
clarke said nike will spend about 20 million on the global 
launch of the shoe that will sell for about 130 
at the securities analysts meeting nike also provided a preview 
of new television commercials 
besides its productoriented commercials it showed a public 
servicetype message encouraging youngsters to stay in school 
starring basketball david robinson of the san antonio spurs his 
mother and georgetown university basketball coach john thompson

apple computer inc improved its line 
of printers monday by introducing two new models it hopes will 
maintain these machines as a moneymaker 
the cupertinobased personal computer company introduced the 
laser printers partly in response to stiff competition on several 
fronts 
at 1999 apples new personal laserwriter sc cuts the cost of 
an entrylevel apple printer by 800 it is aimed at individual 
users who might be tempted to buy one of the several lowerpriced 
printers sold by apple competitors 
but analysts say the other new model the 3299 personal 
laserwriter nt is more important because it is designed to be 
shared by a network of computers 
in addition unlike the model sc the nt comes with postscript 
a brand of software from adobe systems inc that provides apples 
macintosh computers with one of their most important features the 
ability to print elegantly a variety of typefaces and graphics 
analysts say sales of laser printers last year accounted for 
more than 15 percent of apples 53 billion in revenues that 
showing could be seriously threatened in the future by 
hewlettpackard co the market leader in laser printers hp 
recently started making printers that work with apples macintosh 
computers 
in addition several small printer companies have been 
challenging apple for sales to macintosh users 
apple introduced its first laser printer shortly after it 
announced the macintosh in 1984 the combination of these two 
products and special software resulted in a new computer 
application called desktop publishing a way of computerizing the 
layout process of printing

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
lower monday on the chicago board of trade while corn ended mixed 
to higher after some private forecasters predicted hotter drier 
weather for the corn belt 
but most meteorologists continued to forecast a week of mild 
temperatures and scattered showers in the midwest ideal weather 
for corn and soybean development 
wheat futures remained under pressure from the winter wheat 
harvest which is nearing completion 
weve got increasing supplies in a time of very poor foreign 
demand and that leaves prices with nowhere to go but lower said 
joel karlin a grains analyst with research department inc in 
chicago 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cents to 4 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in july at 307 a bushel corn was 
cent lower to 5 cents higher with july unchanged at 280 a bushel 
oats were 2 cents to 3 cents lower with july at 127 a bushel 
soybeans were 5 cents lower to 2 cents higher with july at 616 a

britain on monday denied it was about to link the 
pound to the exchange rate mechanism covering other major european 
currencies 
sterling strengthened in foreign exchange on speculation that 
such an announcement would be made at the houston summit in late 
new york trading the pound was quoted at 18065 up from late 
fridays 17865 
i can assure you that i am not going to announce this morning 
that britain is about to join the exchange rate mechanism john 
major britains chancellor of the exchequer told a news 
conference 
major speaking shortly before the opening of the summit of the 
worlds seven top industrialized nations reiterated that britains 
conditions for joining the exchange rate mechanism were unchanged 
britain promised in principle last summer to join the mechanism 
when its inflation rate now nearly 10 percent and among the 
highest in the european community falls other conditions about 
free capital movements in the community largely have been met 
the exchange rate mechanism links nine of the 12 currencies of 
the european community it is designed to prevent wide fluctuations 
in exchange rates 
earlier major met jacques delors president of the communitys 
executive commission to press britains alternative plan to 
delors radical proposals for a single european community currency 
president delors made it clear the commission is seriously 
examining our proposals said major 
the british proposal is for a new hard european currency the 
european currency unit or ecu to circulate alongside the 
communitys present currencies at present the ecu is used 
primarily as an accounting mechanism 
britain announced the plan last month a special conference is 
due to open in december and is supposed to make final decisions by 
the end of 1992 the year internal ec trade barriers are to be 
dismantled 
the delors program calls for a single central banking system as 
well as one currency britain says it never will agree to the 
delors plan because it means surrendering national control over its 
economy

a japanese developer again topped a list of the 
worlds richest people but the annual tally has one conspicuous 
deletion this year donald j trump 
despite the financial troubles of the new york developer the 
united states continues to contain the worlds largest number of 
billionaires 62 according to estimates by forbes magazine in 
addition there are 37 us families with fortunes over 1 billion 
forbes says in its july 23 issue 
forbes in estimates released monday says the worlds 
wealthiest person for the fourth straight year was yoshiaki 
tsutsumi of japan whose railroad and real estate empire includes 
golf courses ski resorts and hotels forbes estimated his net 
worth at 16 billion up about 1 billion from last year 
that estimate was far greater than that of rival business 
magazine fortune which put tsutsumis net worth at 31 billion 
last september 
fortune said the worlds richest person is the sultan of brunei 
at 25 billion forbes excludes heads of state from consideration 
following the 56yearold tsutsumi on the forbes list was 
japanese developer taikichiro mori a former economics professor 
who now owns 78 office buildings forbes put moris net worth at 
146 billion 
ranked third was the family of sam walton founder of walmart 
the thirdlargest usretail chain forbes estimates that the 
waltons who also were thirdranked last year are worth 133 
billion up from 87 billion in 1989 
americas du pont family was fourth with a net worth estimated 
at 10 billion they were followed by hans and gad rausing two 
swedish brothers who control a packaging empire worth 96 billion 
kitaro watanabe a japanese real estate owner was sixth at 92 
billion he was followed by canadas reichmann brothers owners of 
the olympia amp york real estate company at 9 billion 
kenkichi nakajima and his family founder of japans largest 
maker of pachinko machines a gambling game similar to pinball 
were eighth at 84 billion 
south koreas shin kyukho who owns a candy and real estate 
empire was ninth at 7 billion to 8 billion and forrest e mars 
and family of the united states of mars candy fame were 10th at 
an estimated 6 billion 
other american families with net worth exceeding 3 billion 
included the newhouse hearst and cox families which derive their 
fortunes from publishing and broadcasting the bass family of 
texas the mellon family of banking fame the dorrance family 
whose wealth comes from campbell soup co and bill gates founder 
of the computer software company microsoft corp 
john werner kluge remained the richest american individual 
according to forbes kluge founder of the media company 
metromedia has an estimated net worth of 52 billion placing him 
in a tie for 12th place on the worldwide list with the newhouses 
as for trump forbes put his net worth last year at 17 
billion but it dropped sharply this year as the value of his real 
estate and airline empire plummeted in april the magazine said he 
was worth about a half a billion dollars some sources peg it even 
lower 
forbes says one trend it noticed in compiling this years list 
was the number of wealthy germans the magazine identified 38 west 
german billionaire families far more per capita than in japan or 
the united states 
the list includes 40 japanese and 99 american individuals or 
families with a net worth over 1 billion 
forbes says it identified 271 billionaire individuals or 
families worldwide up from 226 last year the compilation is based 
on recent stock valuations comparable real estate valuations and 
currency exchange rates among other factors 
the magazine says it excludes from consideration royal families 
and heads of state because their wealth derives more from 
political heritage than from economic effort 
but it doesnt exclude drug dealers among the billionaires it 
lists are colombias pablo escobar gaviria the head of the 
medellin cocaine cartel at about 3 billion and colombias ochoa 
family at about 2 billion

donald trump announced monday that galeries 
lafayette the giant french retailer will open a branch store in 
trump tower helping to solidify the value of his 68story 
skyscraper on fifth avenue 
we have a fabulous anchor for trump tower its a fabulous 
tenant trump said at a news conference with galeries lafayettes 
chairman georges meyer 
neither trump nor meyer disclosed terms of the lease published 
reports said it would be for 25 years and estimated it would be 
worth tens of millions of dollars to trump by enhancing the towers 
attractiveness as security for loans 
meyer said the new branch would open in the fall of 1991 it 
will occupy 80000 square feet fronting on 57th street in a 
sixfloor section of the tower vacated by bonwit tellers flagship 
store 
trump had made no bones about wanting to be rid of bonwit the 
previous prime tenant that he characterized as a poorly run 
hasbeen and unfit to be a neighbor of the other shops in trump 
tower 
he paid about 5 million to acquire its lease earlier this year 
after bonwits owner went into reorganization proceedings 
a deal with galeries lafayette was made several weeks ago and 
the papers were signed sunday night trump said 
we took a little bit of a risk when we bought out the lease 
trump said it was my intention to get this group into this 
building and it worked out he said 
asked how his bondholders and investors might feel about it 
trump said i think theyre very very happy 
the main galeries lafayette store in paris occupies 500000 
square feet six times the space of the new york branch after 
harrods of london it is europes biggest department store 
meyer said the company has done more than 4 billion a year in 
business at its 136 stores twenty of the stores bear the galeries 
lafayette name and the rest are operated by subsidiaries he said 
meyer said he was not ready yet to estimate how much business 
the new branch might do

energy futures rose monday led by a surge in 
wholesale gasoline prices 
the session started with brisk selling on the new york 
mercantile exchange amid speculation that supply will exceed demand 
for the near future the end of an oil workers strike in norway 
provided another selling incentive 
but an afternoon rally motivated in part by technical forces 
helped energy prices rebound 
wholesale gasoline prices continued to firm in the aftermath of 
fridays explosion and fire at an arco chemical co plant in texas 
traders bought on the assumption that temporary shortages in a gas 
additive produced by the plant could disrupt availability of 
premium gas grades in some areas 
unleaded gasoline for august delivery jumped 144 cents to 5685 
cents a gallon after adding 046 cent on friday contracts for 
delivery during september through november also posted gains 
the contract for august delivery of the benchmark us crude 
oil west texas intermediate advanced 11 cents to 1658 cents a 
42gallon barrel following fridays decline of 3 cents the 
contracts for delivery through november also settled higher 
among other refined products traded on the exchange wholesale 
home heating oil for august delivery settled at 4890 cents a 
gallon up 060 cent the contract lost 003 cent on friday the 
september through november contracts finished higher 
in natural gas trading the august contract fell to 1493 per 
1000 cubic feet from 1498 on friday 
analyst james steel at refco inc said crude garnered technical 
support from the ability of the august contract to remain above 16 
a barrel despite heavy selling in the morning 
fresh indications that the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries is making a concerted effort to cope with a world oil 
price slump ahead of a general meeting july 25 also encouraged 
buying he said

a french investor accused of insider trading 
on rorer group inc securities has settled the charges with federal 
officials the securities and exchange commission announced monday 
without admitting or denying wrongdoing robert rossi agreed to 
pay nearly 145 million in alleged illegal profits plus interest 
the settlement was approved by a federal judge in new york on 
july 3 
rossi who maintains a mailing address in geneva switzerland 
was accused with three foreign companies last january of trading on 
inside information about merger talks between rorer a fort 
washington penn pharmaceutical company and another company 
later identified as frances rhonepoulenc sa 
daniel a pollack an attorney for rossi in new york said his 
client was pleased with the settlement and takes the position 
that his investment decision was based on his own analyses of rorer 
and other drug stocks the fact that the commission did not 
penalize him but only required him to disgorge his profits is some 
indication that the sec would have a difficult time proving the 
charges agasinst him in a courtroom 
pollack said rossi was a french citizen living in africa but 
declined to say where adding for rossi to have litigated in new 
york city would have been expensive burdensome and time 
consuming 
in january rorer group said it had agreed in principle to 
pursue the sale of a 68 percent stake to rhonepoulenc for about 
73 per share 
the sec has not disclosed how the defendants allegedly obtained 
the inside information 
rossis settlement was the first in the case said gary sundick 
an attorney with the sec in washington he said charges have been 
dismissed against foundation hai of monte carlo monaco

mixed and livestock and meat futures were mixed 
cotton futures fell 08 cent to the permitted daily limit of 2 
cents with the contract for delivery in october off 2 cents at 
7674 cents a pound the july contract expired at 90 cents a pound 
the retreat followed limit losses in most contracts on friday 
analysts attributed the selloff to profittaking after a sixmonth 
rally that boosted the price of cotton for nearterm delivery from 
about 66 cents in early january to a high of 939 cents a pound on 
july 5 
this has been a bull market like we havent seen in years and 
years said ernest simon a cotton specialist with 
prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
he said prices had been driven steadily higher over the past six 
months by strong domestic and international demand for us cotton 
and more recently by poor growing weather in the high plains of 
texas where it has been much too dry and much too hot for weeks 
on end 
a surge in wholesale gasoline prices led energy futures higher 
on the new york mercantile exchange 
analyst stephen w platt of dean witter reynolds inc said 
gasoline prices continued to firm in the aftermath of fridays 
explosion and fire at an arco chemical co plant in texas 
traders bought on the assumption that temporary shortages of a 
gas additive produced by the plant could disrupt availability of 
premium gas grades in some areas platt said 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 27 cents 
lower with august at 1658 a barrel heating oil was 53 cent to 
63 cent higher with august at 4890 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 20 cent to 144 cents higher with august at 5685 
cents a gallon 
sugar futures plummeted on new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa 
exchange after the european commission released a european sugar 
beet crop forecast of 1418 million metric tons up 106000 from a 
year earlier 
further support stemmed from the brazilian governments decision 
to authorize refiners in brazil to produce more sugar and less 
alcohol from sugar cane said analyst arthur stevenson of 
prudentialbache securities inc 
stevenson said trading volume was huge and dominated by 
speculative fund selling 
sugar settled 50 cent to 74 cent lower with october at 119 
cents a pound 
in precious metals trading on new yorks commodity exchange 
gold futures settled 290 to 3 lower with august at 35990 a

weather for the corn belt later this week 
after the close the national weather service issued a new 
sixto10day forecast for mild temperatures and drierthannormal 
conditions in the midwest during the first half of next week 
but most meteorologists continued to forecast scattered showers 
in the region this week which would be beneficial to the corn and 
soybean crops 
wheat futures remained under pressure from the winter wheat 
harvest which was 71 percent complete as of sunday according to 
the agriculture departments weekly cropconditions report 
the report showed slight improvement in the corn crop but no

and slack demand for bacon cattle futures rose in line with 
stronger cash markets

digital equipment corp which is suffering from 
sluggish earnings announced a new midrange computer line monday 
designed to provide desktop computer users with more flexibility 
the computer line called vax 4000 is designed to compete 
directly with computers offered by international business machines 
corp digital unveiled the products at its annual decworld sales 
exposition here 
the new line is based on clientserver computing which allows 
one or more computers to act as control centers for networks of 
desktop machines 
in the 90s people want to use computers in a much more 
effective way said kenneth olsen digitals president 
digital says the vax 4000 delivers more power than ibms popular 
as400 minicomputer at half the cost digital is the worlds 
secondlargest computer company behind ibm 
users want to sit at the desktop of their choice olsen 
said they want the flexibility to quickly access information in 
any database on the network use the right application to get their 
work done and share the work they do with anyone else who needs 
it 
digital estimates there is a potential clientserver market of 
more than 100 billion over the next five years as the networked 
style of computing spreads from the office to the laboratory to the 
factory 
the vax 4000 announcement follows a fiscal year in which digital 
reported sluggish earnings the company based in the suburb of 
maynard has offered voluntary severance to thousands of employees 
to reduce its work force 
digital has not reported its fourthquarter earnings for the 
fiscal year ended june 30 but the company said last month that 
external forecasts of its fourthquarter earnings were too 
optimistic 
in the quarter that ended march 31 digital earned 249 
million or 20 cents a share compared with 256 million or 205 
per share during the same period a year earlier

with west germany and france in the lead the 
prosperous western democracies are gearing up for a 
multibilliondollar effort to protect mikhail gorbachev from the 
economic morass that threatens his hold on soviet power 
long lines and restive consumers give ample evidence that 
gorbachevs economic reforms need an infusion of imagination and 
cash 
inability to keep food stores stocked has already forced moscow 
to spend an extra 3 billion rubles 500 million on food 
imports the white house says half the soviet grain crop goes bad 
before it gets to the marketplace 
gorbachev has asked the west for financial and technical 
assistance and the subject dominated the first day of this weeks 
economic summit the summit leaders are split down the middle on 
how to proceed and apparently agreed monday to allow one another 
to go their own way 
west germany alone hopes to make 31 billion in loans 
available along with france and italy it is pressing for an 
overall western aid package in excess of 15 billion 
if we dont decide now to help the soviet union there is a 
risk that there will be no progress no further reform of the 
soviet political system frances francois mitterrand said in the 
opening summit session his remark was relayed by spokesman hubert 
vedrine 
president bush and margaret thatcher of britain lead the goslow 
faction they question the wisdom of pumping in aid without more 
soviet reform and the americans are emphasizing instead their 
willingness to provide technical assistance to improve soviet 
agriculture and transportation 
nonetheless they have delivered gorbachev a substantial gift by 
not trying to block the others the summit nations are planning to 
act in concert in dispatching teams of bankers and other experts to 
assess soviet needs perhaps setting the stage for a more 
substantial american commitment 
every country has its own kind of legitimate interests and 
concerns marlin fitzwater the white house spokesman said we 
do not question them 
seventythree years after the russian revolution soviet 
officials emphasized on monday that assistance could not carry 
western conditions we arent taking orders said gorbachev 
aide georgy shaknazarov 
but bush has three main objections to offering direct aid the 
soviets heavy military spending their sending 5 billion a year 
in aid to marxist cuba and their slow pace in adapting to 
capitalistic ways 
it was vaguely possible that summit leaders might attempt to set 
specific conditions concerning one or more of those problems before 
approving aid 
the soviets are open about their need for western help i feel 
it would be advantageous for us and the west said foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze he said he disliked the term aid 
preferring credit technical cooperation personnel training 
joint ventures and joint projects a message welcome to bush 
only a year ago the united states britain france canada 
west germany japan and italy stepped gingerly into these uncharted 
waters and decided to help poland and hungary the soviet union 
presents a far more difficult decision 
from the french delegation meanwhile came a statement of 
renewed determination to bolster gorbachev and the soviet economy 
with all aid that is serious and useful 
failure of perestroika could mean gorbachevs downfall and begin 
an era of instability across the soviet union where would the west 
be asked brian mulroney of canada if they chuck him out 
us officials make this kind of case for moving slowly 
it is impossible to keep tabs on assistance many of the 
billions could be diverted to the red army where the generals and 
gorbachev do not always see eye to eye 
it doesnt make sense to send billions to the soviets while 
they are sending billions to cuba a state whose interests often 
collide with the united states mulroney agrees with bush that 
soviet aid to cuba is profoundly unacceptable and he said 
canada was willing to provide trade credits not direct assistance 
the soviet economy is so messed up that immediate aid will be 
wasted treasury secretary nicholas brady said monday theres no 
sense in pouring money into a system that isnt ready to receive 
it

president bush argued very forcefully with 
his summit partners monday to phase out billions of dollars in farm 
subsidies but there were few signs that european leaders would heed 
the arguments 
bush has made reaching a compromise on the farm issue a top 
priority at this weeks sevennation economic summit believing 
that a resolution is critical to breaking a deadlock in a fouryear 
effort to overhaul the global trading system 
but officials of the 12nation european community which 
participates in the annual economic summit gatherings insisted 
that houston was not the place to negotiate on the trade issue 
throwing into doubt whether the administration will be able to 
achieve a hopedfor breakthrough 
the united states has much at stake in the global trade talks 
because they offer the promise of greatly expanding markets for 
us farmers and businesses more exports would help reduce 
americas 100 billion annual trade deficit 
the trade talks known as the uruguay round for the country 
where they were launched in 1986 have reached a virtual stalemate 
over the divisive farm issue 
bush brought up the trade negotiations in a string of oneonone 
sessions with world leaders before the summit officially got under 
way monday 
white house chief of staff john sununu told reporters that bush 
believed resolution of the trade dispute is critical it should 
and must be done 
the agricultural question was taken up in the first round of 
talks between the leaders on monday afternoon at rice university 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters the 
administration fears that the entire global free trade talks will 
falter without a resolution of the farm issue 
bush is making the point very forcefully to his summit 
partners that this is an enormously important activity 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter told reporters 
yeutter said that so far the european community has not been 
engaged in the process 
but the european community contends that between 2 million and 3 
millin european farmers could lose their jobs if the subsidies 
which support their lessefficient operations were eliminated 
the ec known as the common market is represented at the 
economic summit by ec president jacques delors who met with bush 
before the summit began to discuss their differences 
bush took a tough stance telling delors that the political 
leaders needed to exhibit courage to resolve the issue an ec 
official said 
it was quite hard on agriculture said the official who 
spoke on condition that his name not be used 
aides said bush also discussed agricultural policy in his 
meeting with french president francois mitterrand and west german 
chancellor helmut kohl the two leaders with the strongest 
opposition to total elimination of farm subsidies 
kohl indicated to bush that a draft negotiating paper on the 
agricultural issue unveiled recently by the chairman of the 
negotiating group aart de zeeuw a former dutch agricultural 
official could be the basis for breaking the deadlock hans klein 
kohls spokesman told reporters 
yeutter said kohls stance was mildly encouraging but 
another us official who spoke on condition that his name not be 
used said that it was unclear whether kohls comments really 
signified a new willingness to negotiate 
kohl is particularly crucial to resolving the agricultural 
question because bush is unlikely to push too hard for concessions 
if the german leader digs in his heels because of upcoming german 
unification elections 
those elections will occur around the time negotiators are 
scheduled to meet in brussels for the final bargaining session to 
complete the uruguay round of trade talks the talks are being 
conducted under the auspices of the 97nation general agreement on 
tariffs and trade 
in the opening session kohl spoke about the need to conclude 
the global trade talks successfully telling the other leaders 
we should give the negotiators a positive signal and a 
political orientation that we all jointly stand for strengthening 
the gatt 
canadian foreign minister joe clark said he believed after 
discussions with common market officials that some ground can be 
found for forward movement 
us trade representative carla hills told reporters that the 
united states hoped to achieve a commitment from the summit 
countries to use the de zeeuw paper as the basis for working out a 
final agreement but she said it was not certain whether even this 
position would overcome european resistance 
in addition to phasing out farm subsidies the united states has 
an ambitious goal of expanding global trade rules to include about 
1 trillion in trade not now covered by the gatt the world body 
which policies trade disputes 
the us proposal would result in the elimination of barriers to 
trade in the highgrowth area of banking and other services where 
us companies are extremely competitive american negotiators are 
also pushing to extend gatt rules to cover better enforcement of 
trade and copyright piracy which is estimated to cost american 
companies 60 billion in lost sales each year 
in all of these issues agriculture is seen as the key because 
third world countries have balked at agreeing to us proposals on 
expanding gatt coverage unless they win expanded markets for their 
farm products

the timber industry urged the government 
monday to reject a spottedowl protection strategy proposed by 
government scientists saying it would cost 102000 jobs and turn 
some towns into rural ghettos 
researchers commissioned by the american forest resource 
alliance said logging communities in washington oregon and 
northern california accept the need to reduce timber harvests to 
protect the environment 
but they said the government should consider human as well as 
environmental needs in developing a plan to protect the endangered 
owl 
yeah were going to lose jobs said john beuter a forest 
economics consultant from portland ore he said the question is 
how much of this is really necessary and how will it be 
implemented over time 
the forest service has estimated that 28000 timber jobs would 
be lost by the end of the decade under owlprotection policies 
recommended in an april report written by team of government 
scientists headed by jack ward thomas 
beuter said his research shows the figure would be twice that 
plus thousands more jobs lost outside the timber industry the 
direct and indirect job loss would come to 102000 by the end of 
the decade if the reports strategy is applied to public and 
private lands he said 
a federal timber task force is scheduled to come up with an 
extensive owlprotection plan by sept 1 
estimates of the remaining spotted owl population range from 
3000 to 5000 pairs each nesting pair needs a large tract of 
undisturbed oldgrowth forest biologists say 
robert lee a natural resource sociologist at the university of 
washington said a bitter class war already has developed between 
urban environmentalists who want to save oldgrowth forests and 
loggers who are portrayed as neanderthals of the woods 
lee part of the timber industrys research team predicted 
rural communities would find it difficult to adapt to a changing 
economy people are so isolated he said they have 
nontransferable skills they have a sense of identity they 
may not be able to sell their homes theyre immobilized 
the stress on timber workers could lead to increased suicides 
drug abuse and family violence lee said 
the real issue is how to humanize the transition to another 
way of life he said adding that one way would be to let 
northwest communities participate in the decisionmaking process 
last month the bush administration announced partial plans to 
reduce timber harvests on land controlled by the bureau of land 
management the estimated impact of those plans would be about 
1000 logging jobs lost over two years 
the administration also formed the task force which is working 
on a plan for the millions of acres controlled by the forest 
service 
environmentalists have indicated they will go to court if the 
eventual plan is less than the thomas report strategy 
the fish and wildlife service last month announced it will 
classify the spotted owl as threatened and entitled to protection 
under the endangered species act the act requires federal agencies 
to secure permission from the service before harming a species or 
its habitat 
the study team for the american forest resource alliance reports 
included private consultants as well as economists social 
scientists and foresters from the universities of washington 
california montana and minnesota
