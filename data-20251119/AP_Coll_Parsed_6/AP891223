a drawspan on the worlds longest floating bridge 
was raised accidentally during a test friday sending rushhour 
traffic into a rising wall of steel that killed one woman and 
injured at least five other people 
state officials were at a loss to explain what went wrong in the 
test which has been conducted every friday morning for 18 years 
without incident said leslie salisbury a department of 
transportation spokeswoman 
she said operator error had virtually been ruled out in the 850 
am accident which blocked traffic in both directions on the 
evergreen point bridge the span reopened at 245 pm 
the 25yearold bridge a series of concrete pontoons across 
lake washington opens by raising two 100footlong steel grids 
about 7 feet and moving an adjacent pontoon beneath them 
the weekly test checks drawbridge circuitry and does not involve 
actually moving the span 
salisbury said the bridgeopening sequence requires 18 distinct 
steps when the operator got to the 10th step for some reason 
one part of the drawspan opened up she said 
transportation department crews ran through the procedure three 
times friday afternoon and every time we got to that step the 
drawspan opened salisbury said 
the step should not have involved the drawspan mechanism at all 
she said ron anderson department district administrator 
likened it to turning on your windshield wipers and having the 
radio come on instead salisbury said 
the bridge drawspan lifted about 4 feet creating a wall that 
three vehicles drove into headon several cars were left perched 
on the elevated section of the bridge some with blown tires and 
mangled metal from hitting the rising span no cars went into the 
water 
mark bauty a motorist told radio station kiro that his car 
bounced over the lip of the drawspan just as it started to open and 
he could hear tires screeching and metal crunching behind him 
the bridge was probably 6 inches high i guess when i hit it 
and the car made it over the front end kept right on going and 
flew off the back end when the bridge was probably about a 
footandahalf to two feet high he said 
when i realized what happened and i looked in the rear view 
mirror i could see some cars who had headed into what appeared to 
be solid steel 
there was no warning the bridge was opening said dot 
spokeswoman heidi keller normally gates are lowered and lights 
flash to stop traffic 
the identity of the 44yearold seattle woman killed in the 
accident was not released john lombardini county medical examiner 
investigator said an autopsy would be conducted to determine the 
cause of death 
three people were hospitalized in serious but stable condition 
with multiple injuries and two other people were treated and 
discharged 
salisbury said the motors for the bridge span were disengaged 
and the control panel locked 
state inspectors will check the bridge further on tuesday for 
possible damage and expect to close the bridge briefly in january 
for a more detailed look 
she said the department also has recommended an independent 
consultant do an investigation 
opening the drawspan which provides a 200foot opening is 
necessary only 30 to 40 times a year because most vessels can pass 
under elevated portions of the bridge at each end officials said 
evergreen point bridge formally known as the albert d 
rosellini bridge is more than two miles long and more than 7000 
feet of it is on pontoons

trying to leave the cave when the boulder fell on his legs 
trapping him about 2 hours

subzero wind chills 
meek said the sheriffs office was notified of the accident 
about 730 pm meek said he unsure just how the boulder was moved 
to free the explorer 
meek said the cave is in a protected area along barton creek on 
a ranchers private land

the bush administration will consider aid to 
the new government taking shape in romania once it dismantles the 
system inherited from ousted president nicolae ceaucescu and 
institutes reforms officials say 
the white house and the state department hailed the demise of 
ceaucescus hardline government friday and expressed hope for a 
peaceful transition to democracy 
state department deputy spokesman richard boucher credited the 
courageous and persistent action by the romanian people who 
prevailed in the face of great odds and despite bloody 
repression 
ceausescus ouster seemed to foreshadow an improvement in 
usromanian relations which have been under severe strain 
particularly since last weekend when antigovernment uprisings 
began 
ceaucescus repressive policies contributed to romanias loss of 
us trade privileges last year the administration was about to 
impose additional sanctions friday but reversed itself after 
ceaucescu was forced out 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said us aid would be 
considered once reforms are made by romanias new authorities 
boucher gave a cautious welcome to the designation of a former 
diplomat corneliu manescu to form an interim government 
he said manescus career has been distinguished and he noted the 
onetime foreign minister has been a leading advocate of political 
reform in romania 
fitzwater said the united states is ready for better relations 
with the new government if it moves along a path of general 
democratic reform the united states pledges its strong support and 
assistance 
we hope that romania will soon join the other countries in 
central and eastern europe which have ushered in a new era of 
cooperation between east and west the spokesman said 
boucher said the state department formed a task force thursday 
night to monitor events in romania and ordered the partial 
evacuation of the us embassy in bucharest when the situation 
appeared to be worsening 
with the dramatic turn of events friday morning the evacuation 
order was rescinded but embassy dependents who wished to depart the 
country were allowed to do so about 20 chose to leave friday 
boucher said

the editorial is there a santa claus first appeared in the 
new york sun sept 21 1897 it was written by francis pharcellus 
church an assistant to the editor of the sun 
we take pleasure in answering at once and thus prominently the 
communication below expressing at the same time our great 
gratification that its faithful author is numbered among the 
friends of the sun 
dear editor 
i am 8 years old 
some of my little friends say there is no santa claus 
papa says if you see it in the sun its so 
please tell me the truth is there a santa claus 
virginia ohanlon 
115 west 95th street 
virginia your little friends are wrong they have been affected 
by the skepticism of a skeptical age they do not believe except 
they see they think that nothing can be which is not 
comprehensible by their little minds all minds virginia whether 
they be mens or childrens are little in this great universe of 
ours man is a mere insect an ant in his intellect as compared 
with the boundless world about him as measured by the intelligence 
capable of grasping the whole of truth and knowledge 
yes virginia there is a santa claus he exists as certainly as 
love and generosity and devotion exist and you know that they 
abound and give to your life its highest beauty and joy alas how 
dreary would be the world if there were no santa claus it would be 
as dreary as if there were no virginias there would be no 
childlike faith then no poetry no romance to make tolerable this 
existence we should have no enjoyment except in sense and sight 
the eternal light with which childhood fills the world would be 
extinguished 
not believe in santa claus you might as well not believe in 
fairies you might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the 
chimneys on christmas eve to catch santa claus but even if they 
did not see santa claus coming down what would that prove nobody 
sees santa claus but that is no sign that there is no santa claus 
the most real things in the world are those that neither children 
nor men can see did you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn of 
course not but thats no proof that they are not there nobody can 
conceive or imagine all the wonders there are unseen and unseeable 
in the world 
you tear apart the babys rattle and see what makes the noise 
inside but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the 
strongest man not even the united strength of all the strongest 
men that ever lived could tear apart only faith fancy poetry 
love romance can push aside that curtain and view and picture the 
supernal beauty and glory beyond is it all real ah virginia in 
all this world there is nothing else real and abiding 
no santa claus thank god he lives and he lives forever a 
thousand years from now virginia nay ten times ten thousand 
years from now he will continue to make glad the heart of 
childhood

the man who caused the deaths of 27 
people on a church bus in the nations worst drunkendriving 
accident was taken to jail after a jury recommended a 16year 
prison sentence 
but the relatives of some of his victims said the jury which 
rejected murder charges to find him guilty of manslaughter was too 
lenient they noted larry mahoney still has a family to celebrate 
christmas with 
were going to spend it in a cemetery with a headstone bill 
nichols said after a sentencing hearing friday clasping hands 
with his wife madeline 
the couples only child 17yearold william joseph nichols jr 
was among the 24 youths and three adults killed by smoke inhalation 
and flames in a fire that swept through a former school bus after 
mahoneys pickup struck it on interstate 71 five miles south of 
carrollton mahoney was drunk and driving on the wrong side of the 
highway when the crash occurred may 14 1988 
mahoney 36 who had been free on bond prior to his conviction 
was led in handcuffs out of the carroll county courthouse friday 
and taken to the local jail after circuit judge charles satterwhite 
discontinued his bail 
mahoney was convicted on thursday of 27 counts each of 
seconddegree manslaughter and firstdegree wanton endangerment 12 
of firstdegree assault 14 of seconddegree wanton endangerment 
and one of drunken driving 
the jury on friday recommended sentences totaling 611 years but 
opted to have them run concurrently that effectively gave mahoney 
16 years of a possible 20year sentence for assault the most 
serious offense he would be eligible for parole consideration in 
eight years under kentucky law 
satterwhite is to sentence mahoney february 23 the judge can 
give mahoney a lighter sentence but cannot exceed the jurys 
recommendation 
if you ask me if im disappointed yeah im disappointed 
said assistant attorney general paul richwalsky who prosecuted 
mahoney on 27 murder counts i thought all of the carnage was 
worth more than eight years in prison 
the jurys recommendation shocked karen morgan president of 
students against drunk driving at radcliffs north hardin high 
school 
its going to be hard going back to my school and telling 
them that this man only got a minimum of eight years said miss 
morgan whose 13yearold brother phillip was among those killed 
what kind of example do you set for them 
defense attorneys william summers and russell baldani said they 
were pleased with the verdicts and sentencing recommendation but 
will appeal the convictions 
what is mahoneys life worth summers said will it 
bring somebody back will it make them feel better 
at his sentencing hearing mahoney told the jury he intended to 
lecture schoolchildren on the evils of drinking and driving

american troops who stormed gen 
manuel antonio noriegas quarters found photographs of adolf hitler 
and mother teresa a voodoo witches brewery and a packet of 
cocaine wrapped in a banana leaf us officers say 
the ousted dictators homes and offices also contained items 
ranging from christmas trees to highpowered arms as well as a 
collection of pornography gen maxwell thurman commander of the 
us southern command and other officers told reporters friday 
a bucket in an upstairs bathroom of one house was filled with a 
rustyred looking substance identified as blood an officer said he 
did not know what kind of creature the blood came from or what it 
was used for 
officers said soldiers who burst into the house on the first day 
of the us intervention here tuesday narrowly missed capturing 
four voodoo witches from brazil 
the socalled witch house a fortified structure specially 
built for noriega contained such voodoo artifacts as dead fish 
adorned with yellow ribbons two bowls of popcorn cluttered with 
dead flowers and broken statues 
this was the brewery for the witches if you will said col 
mike snell the officer in charge of the area 
thurman said the voodoo practitioners practiced rituals 
for noriegas protection 
the banana leaf with the cocaine inside it was found in a 
freezer snell said it was part of 50 pounds of the drug found in 
noriegas quarters 
the generals office in panamas military barracks at fort 
amador had two display cases containing plastic frogs electronic 
toys such as a video wristwatch and framed pictures of hitler 
mother teresa and libyan leader moammar ghadafi his downtown 
office was adorned with christmas trees more electronics and more 
frogs 
pornography was found at both offices snell said 
sgt 1st class joseph torregrossa said the fort amador office 
also contained expensive prints and a lot of expensive weapons 
mostly automatic he had german lugers israeli uzis all sorts of 
real sophisticated stuff 
thurman told reporters he was clearly dedicated to outfitting 
a substantial force outfitting dignity battalions which in the 
long run would have given the us a tremendous challenge in this 
area 
us intelligence officials scoured the offices in the hope of 
finding records that would help trace noriegas assets in 
washington justice department spokesman david runkel said 
financial documents seized by the troops in noriegas offices might 
help authorities trace assets and bank holdings stashed in foreign 
countries 
snell said noriega had been spotted at the house during the last 
several months 
he said the house was searched for booby traps after pipe bombs 
were found in it 
lt curtis vinyard said the house had apparently been occupied 
until shortly before it was stormed by us troops 
there was still a candle burning he said 
the house on the seacoast near here and close to several us 
military bases was stormed by us soldiers on tuesday about six 
hours after the us invasion began

the us invasion of panama has inflamed 
latin american sensitivity about national selfdetermination and 
revived the old image of a militaristic meddling uncle sam 
from the rio grande to cape horn and including the caribbean 
government officials newspapers and other opinionmakers have 
roundly condemned the military action as improper and immoral 
the force and unanimity of the reaction reflects just how 
passionately latin americans embrace the principle of 
nonintervention coupled with a persistent sense of vulnerability 
toward the superpower to the north it overshadows universal 
revulsion toward noriega who was seen as a throwback to the 
thuggish dictators of the 1950s 
given the simplistic and emotional way the united states is 
used to dealing with sensitive issues that of drug trafficking 
for instance what is there to guarantee that in the future the 
us wont decide that this problem has become unmanageable in 
colombia asked respected columnist enrique santos in the 
independent bogota daily el tiempo 
one excess could lead to another he warned 
el tiempo said in an editorial that the us action in panama 
wounds the sensibility of a continent with a collective memory of 
other interventions 
on a halfdozen occasions during the 1900s the united states 
has dispatched troops to latin american or caribbean nations to 
effect and enforce political change the most recent cases were 
grenada in 1983 and the dominican republic in 1967 
joaquin balaguer the dominican republics president said the 
new us action in spite of the expressed motives which deserve 
all our respect and sympathy is condemned by the dominician 
government and people 
the government of barbados which backed the invasion of 
grenada criticized the new action as did the barbadosbased daily 
the nation one of the caribbeans largest newspapers 
no excuse this time mr bush the nation said in an 
editorial headline it said it supported the grenada investion 
because it was carried out with regional support we did not see 
the americans then in the role of an aggressive superpower 
trampling on weak opponents and acting on its own we do in this 
case 
across the region news of the fighting in panama has dominated 
front pages and television broadcasts some of the coverage has 
been laced by stinging editorial comment 
in rio de janeiro the independent daily jornal do brasil ran an 
editorial cartoon depicting president bush as a caveman with a bone 
in his hair a club and a us flag worn bearskinstyle in a 
frontpage analysis the newspaper said the big stick to which 
president george bush resorted in imposing his order on panama 
could reveal its most twisted effect the boomerang 
on the other hand not a single latin american leader defended 
noriegas harsh reign 
mario vargas llosa a novelist and conservative presidential 
candidate widely expected to win election in peru described 
noriega as a disgrace and embarrassment to all the people of 
latin america he said the principle of nonintervention could 
not be invoked to justify noriegas dictatorship but nonetheless 
expressed regret over the invasion and called for the withdrawal of 
us troops 
the conservative bogota daily el siglo said the us invasion 
had transformed noriega from a victimizer into a victim 
in the most forceful response of a latin american leader perus 
leftist president alan garcia recalled his countrys ambassador 
to the united states and proposed postponing a feb 15 drug summit 
in cartagena colombia with bush garcia president virgilio barco 
of colombia and president jaime paz zamora of bolivia 
i cannot meet with the leader of an invading nation garcia 
said holding a dialogue with a pistol on the table cannot be 
permitted 
perus government also suspended joint operations with us drug 
agents in the countrys cocagrowing huallaga valley 
the barco government in colombia said it would not hurry to 
recognize the new panamanian presidency of guillermo endara whose 
swearingin at a us military base as the invasion got under way 
was seen by many latin americans as embarassingly staged 
fernando color de mello the presidentelect of brazil latin 
americas largest country called the invasion a regrettable 
episode that runs contrary to global currents in favor of 
selfdetermination and political liberalization especially in 
eastern europe 
the seven leading latin american democracies of peru brazil 
mexico colombia venezuela uruguay and argentina have been 
adamant in pressing the principle of nonintervention as a solution 
to central americas political conflicts in response to the us 
invasion the countries pushed a resolution in the organization of 
american states strongly condemning it 
president carlos salinas de gortari of mexico said the invasion 
is contrary to the principles that regulate international 
relations 
mexicos political parties in their first unanimous action in 
many years also blasted the invasion

eastern airlines announced its first cut in 
scheduled daily flights since it began its reorganization last 
march at the outset of a long strike and said it might lay off 
some employees 
the carrier which earlier in the week sold its latin american 
routes to american airlines announced friday it was cutting daily 
flights from 830 to 802 effective jan 31 
eliminated flights include some nonstop service from miami to 
boston philadelphia orlando tampa and runs to several caribbean 
cities more flight cutbacks are to follow once the deal with 
american has been completed

eastern which had more than 30000 employees and 1040 daily 
flights before the strike began march 4 now employs about 20000 
workers most of them nonunion

creditors five days after its three unions struck last march in 
april the carrier announced plans to rebuild to about twothirds 
its prestrike size 
in august negotiations over the sale of easterns central and 
south american routes to american stalled and eastern officials 
said they would keep those routes and build back to 90 percent of 
their airlines prestrike size 
but eastern creditors reportedly were displeased over projected 
cash shortfalls prompting the sale this week of the latin american 
service and other assets by easterns parent texas air corp 
approval of the sale to american by the us department of 
transportation and the us bankruptcy court is expected to take up 
to six months and eastern will continue to fly the routes until 
approval has been granted 
officials of the machinists union the only union still on 
strike said easterns planes are flying at less than half capacity 
in spite of the airlines sharp discounting to boost business 
eastern flights averaged about 50 percent occupancy during the 
first half of december matell said

at the sledgehammers final blow a 
cheer went up from the crowd outside a house belonging to one of 
gen manuel antonio noriegas closest associates 
people poured into the house at a dead run exultant they 
poured out again with bottles of french champagne silver coffee 
pots and sequined sombreros 
but this was no ordinary looting mission it was a middleclass 
crowd for the most part and they were venting pentup loathing for 
the general and all he stood for 
democracy has arrived one young man said we dont want 
these military guys running things they are thieves 
someone emptied a case of campaignstyle buttons bearing the 
slogan onward with noriega and began gleefully stomping on 
them grinding them flat with a little dance as onlookers applauded 
the house belonged to carlos a wittgreen a businessman 
believed to be a key player in the maze of front companies hiding 
noriegas moneylaundering and cocainesmuggling schemes 
hes noriegas right hand one man said as people opened box 
after box of handcuffs in amazement 
the house was sacked after a us armored vehicle bombarded the 
place 
troops barricaded the street at midafternoon friday and opened 
fire they pelted it with tear gas and demanded wittgreens 
surrender over a bullhorn 
when no one emerged they left and the people began running 
toward the house cheering 
teresa bay guardia sat on the grass nearby sorting through the 
files and boxes of documents her teenagers were hauling out as 
fast as they could their eyes streamed from the biting sting of 
the tear gas trapped inside but they were grinning like theyd 
just won the lottery 
im gathering evidence she said as sofas office chairs 
potted plants and paintings went by at a dizzying clip i have a 
friend in the opposition im giving this to 
there was a pile of letterhead stationery five different 
companies five different addresses one telephone number 
someone else found a handwritten ledger in a spiral notebook 
page after page of coded transactions many with noriegas general 
staff 
guardia a us citizen raised in panama looked at the pile of 
documents as though christmas had come a few days early to panama 
ive walked many a mile been in many a demonstration against 
noriega she said this is the first time i havent been afraid 
to give my name 
she said she couldnt understand the international criticism of 
the us invasion ask the panamanians were the ones who have 
been living the situation she said 
even with the lawlessness and looting that has broken out she 
said were delighted

stadiums and schools to flee fighting that has ravaged the capital

strikes by us warplanes and mortar attacks by panamanian fighters 
residents in many neighborhoods organized vigilante groups to 
ward off the looters of homes and businesses who roamed the streets 
at will 
citizens erected tire barricades and armed themselves for 
protection against the anarchy which spread to middleclass 
neighborhoods on friday 
the only way to protect what little we have left is to protect 
it ourselves said jorge perez a 36yearold homeowner in the 
suburb of san francisco 
the citys police part of the panamanian defense forces 
disbanded or collapsed when the invasion began at midnight tuesday 
the threeday looting spree left most businesses and grocery 
stores depleted of basic foods streets were littered with broken 
glass and trash 
many shopkeepers kept looters at bay with guns paying customers

and i made my way through the fighting until i was able to reach my 
mothers house one man said by telephone from his mothers home 
where 15 others had taken refuge 
a red cross official appealed for food donations as shortages of 
many basics worsened he noted that many people were donating as 
much as they can spare and that many us troops provided 
rations but said much more help was needed 
hospitals staffed by doctors and nurses working 16 and 24hour 
shifts were overcrowded with the wounded and the dead and ran short 
of everything from alcohol to analgesics to surgical gauze 
besides everything not only is there no transportation but 
the staff is scared to go outside said dr elmer miranda deputy 
director of the santo tomas hospital 
the united states only gives us bullets he said 
he complained that supply flights still were prevented from 
entering panama because the countrys airports remained closed 
under us military control

morgue one hospital official estimated there were 1000 wounded 
most of them civilians 
one resident surveyed the destroyed building of noriegas

for the widow of maj moises giroldi who led 
octobers failed coup attempt against gen manuel antonio noriega 
the us overthrow of the panamanian strongman was the welcome 
culmination of a sad story 
but adela bonilla de giroldi said she doesnt think gen manuel 
antonio noriega who she believes killed of her husband will ever 
see trial in the united states despite the 1 million bounty 
offered by president bush 
i have faith that they will find him dead she said they 
will never catch him alive it doesnt matter to me if bush wants 
to put a price on noriegas head the important thing is that 
noriega doesnt stay in panama 
mrs giroldi 36 called us army officials two days before the 
failed oct 3 coup attempt by her husband to appeal for help the 
coup failed and noriega was reported to have executed giroldi 
himself after regaining control mrs giroldi is among those who 
accuse the united states of dooming the coup by failing to support 
it quickly enough 
i was so frustrated because president bush didnt do anything 
for my husband mrs giroldi said thursday in miami where she 
fled after the failed coup but now even though many lives have 
been lost in the us invasion i am relieved my husband did not 
die in vain his dream of ridding panama of noriega has come true 
he is dead but he died for a great cause 
mrs giroldi said her husband a onetime confidante of noriega 
planned to deliver the general alive to us authorities to face 
drug trafficking charges but pentagon officials have said giroldi 
planed to let noriega retire in panama the bush administration its 
inaction during the coup attempt stemmed from disagreement among 
the rebels about what to do with noriega 
like many panamanian exiles mrs giroldi a mother of three who 
worked at the national bank of panama said she would return as 
soon as stability was restored 
it is our home and we want to help rebuild it she said

panamanians greeted occupying us 
forces with some cheers and some sneers but mostly fear and many 
remained at home rather than risk exposure in glasslittered 
streets swarming with looters 
some of those who did venture out expressed hopes only that the 
bloodshed and destruction would cease 
businessman moises levi pointed at his looted store and then at 
an american soldier standing atop a nearby armored personnel 
carrier 
how many soldiers are there here 20000 40000 where are 
they he asked 
mayhem and destruction have descended on the city since us 
troops began their invasion at midnight tuesday knots of fighters 
backing ousted gen manuel antonio noriega have attacked then 
disappeared while shopkeepers trade shots with swarms of looters 
they really screwed me up as a businessman said bicycle 
shop owner ivan rios as a panamanian i am opposed to this type 
of military action against my country but i am also glad that at 
last we are going to have democracy 
many panamanians were too frightened to come out of their homes 
and display any emotion about the events that rocked their central 
american country but some did cheer americans stationed around the 
nicaraguan embassy 
streets in this city of 1 million people were layered with 
broken glass overturned trash cans and fallen light poles plumes 
of smoke darkened the sky where gunfire and mortar attacks were 
launched 
two american officers escorted by a dozen american gis in battle 
gear toured the santo tomas hospital deputy director dr elmer 
miranda said they were on an inspection of the building 
miranda criticized the americans because in addition to dead 
and wounded the assault created a shortage of food and all types 
of medicines he said the closing of airports was preventing aid 
from entering the country 
one administrative employee hurrying along a corridor also 
chastized the american action 
they are butchering us we dont want any help from them 
she said the united states are courageous with panama but they 
do not dare meddle with russia or japan 
out on the streets though a busload of civilians passing by 
the nicaraguan embassy on friday morning waved white handkerchiefs 
and cheered the us soldiers standing by their armored cars 
the americans who cordoned off the embassy following rumors 
that noriega was there smiled and waved back 
marine lance cpl tracy scott jones of dallas said that after 
the shock of the first days battle people were cheering us on 
they are on our side they clapped as we rolled through the 
streets there was no hostility 
lance cpl william young of seattle said civilians were 
friendly they give us the thumbs up sign 
when you go out on a mission at night the situation is pretty 
tense you just look at the darkness and all you can see are the 
shapes of people said young but then when you go out in the 
day people are pretty friendly

the senate ethics committee says its formally 
investigating five senators who intervened with regulators for a 
troubled savings and loan and a sixth accused of influence 
peddling 
the lawmakers are using the announcement to again proclaim their 
innocence 
the committee said friday it has begun preliminary inquiries of 
the six the first of three possible investigative steps but 
emphasized in a statement it has taken no position as to the 
merits of the allegations or the weight of the evidence 
in the savings and loan case the ethics panel will probe the 
activities of majority whip alan cranston dcalif banking 
committee chairman donald w riegle jr dmich john mccain 
rariz dennis deconcini dariz and john glenn dohio 
congressional watchdog common cause asked for the investigation 
sen alfonse damato rny will be the subject of the 
influencepeddling inquiry expected to focus in part on the award 
of federal housing money to the senators political contributors a 
complaint was filed by a political opponent of the senator 
its a good move said murray flander press secretary to 
cranston in a comment that echoed the sentiments expressed by the 
other five lawmakers 
the fact that they are conducting a full preliminary 
investigation and the fact that he will be cleared this will 
obviate any charges of whitewash afterwards he said 
a preliminary inquiry determines whether there is reason to 
believe senate rules were broken an affirmative finding is needed 
before the committee would proceed to the next level 
cranston riegle mccain deconcini and glenn received a 
combined 13 million for their campaigns and causes from charles 
h keating jr who headed lincoln savings and loan of irvine 
calif the senators met with regulators on keatings behalf in 1987 
the government didnt seize control of lincoln until last april 
14 and the eventual cost to taxpayers is expected to reach a 
record level for a thrift failure of more than 2 billion 
the ethics committee headed by sens howell heflin dala and 
warren rudman rnh had hired an outside counsel robert bennett 
of washington to determine whether a formal probe should begin in 
the lincoln case another washington attorney henry schuelke 
performed the same role in the damato case the panel said both 
counsels had recommended the preliminary inquiries 
mccain spokesman scott selley said the senator has cooperated 
fully with the committee and will continue to do so frankly we 
think theyll find there was nothing wrong with what senator mccain 
did 
deconcini commented i welcome a thorough evaluation of the 
facts and feel confident that i will be exnerated 
glenn was out of town and not available said assistant press 
secretary paul brinkman 
damato said he was delighted with the announcement and 
predicted my actions are going to be proven to be correct 
responsible and the work appropriate in every matter 
riegles office issued a statement that the senator strongly 
supports this review and knows it will determine his conduct to 
have been entirely proper

the staff of a panama city hotel helped hide a 
group of americans from panamanian defense forces troops who were 
looking for american citizens to take hostage after the us 
invasion members of the group said 
we were playing hide and seek with the pdf said jay 
skinner an eastern airlines pilot the marriott employees helped 
us stay one step ahead of them 
on tuesday night hours before us troops launched their 
military action to oust panamanian gen manuel antonio noriega 
skinner and his crew arrived in panama city on a routine flight 
from miami 
at 1 am wednesday they awoke at the marriott hotel to the 
sound of gunfire 
i woke up when it started said skinner 45 who was a 
helicopter pilot in vietnam i saw the tracers going and heard 
gunshots and i said here we go 
the pilot and his copilot ron smith peered out their windows 
and saw smoke and guntoting panamanians the invasion had begun 
after staying in his room all night smith phoned downstairs for 
breakfast about 900 am 
thats when the hotel employees came up and took us down to 
the basement smith said hotel staff explained that the pdf was 
after us citizens 
while the pdf searched the hotels upper floors the crew and 
other americans hid in the basement some of the flight attendants 
hid inside industrialsized washing machines while smith said he 
covered himself with a cloth and hid in a ditch 
skinner said the group changed hiding places frequently he said 
his military training helped him lead troops from the 82nd airborne 
to the groups final hiding place wednesday night 
he first established telephone contact with eastern and worked 
out a code to help the troops pinpoint the groups location 
they came right to us he said it worked like a 
fineoiled machine 
smith and joseph andraos the crews second officer both 
praised skinners skill in handling the situation 
jay skinner is an example of what a captain should be said 
andraos he kept things under control 
skinner smith and andraos were greeted with cheers from fellow 
eastern employees when they brought their empty plane back to miami 
international airport friday afternoon 
earlier in the day a chartered eastern flight also reached 
miami with skinners flight crew and 57 other hotel guests 
including those skinner protected from the pdf 
the fighting upset the gambling streak of one of the passengers 
fairborn maxwell a 45yearold jamaican who was in the casino when 
the panamanians stormed the hotel they briefly held him but 
released him when they found he was not american 
i was winning with a stack of chips when they came in and took 
us he said ruefully 
he brought his chips back to miami because he couldnt cash 
them in

the government protected its case against 
oliver l north from the possible taint of his immunized testimony 
irancontra prosecutors assert in opposing norths bid to get his 
convictions reversed 
in a 70page federal appeals court brief friday prosecutors 
characterized as legally and factually unsound norths argument 
that the government won three felony convictions against him 
without properly guarding against all use of immunized testimony he 
gave on capitol hill 
the extraordinary protective procedures undertaken by 
prosecutors and the court assured that norths immunized 
testimony did not contribute to his conviction said associate 
independent counsel gerald lynch 
prosecutors in the office of independent counsel lawrence walsh 
were instructed to avoid learning the ontents of immunized 
testimony from any source in the irancontra affair 
us district judge gerhard gesell who presided at norths 
trial undertook extraordinary efforts to protect norths 
rights lynch said 
north told the appeals court last month he was convicted with 
a stunning disregard for his 5th amendment rights against 
selfincrimination 
north does not contend that any of the governments trial 
witnesses were discovered as a result of his congressional 
testimony or that a single specific piece of grand jury or trial 
evidence was derived from that testimony responded the 
prosecution 
walshs office said north objects only to the trial courts 
alleged failure to follow the procedures established to protect 
core fifth amendment rights 
norths appeal is scheduled for argument feb 6 
the prosecution also said gesell made the correct decision in 
quashing norths subpoena seeking to compel former president reagan 
to testify at his trial north said his activities were authorized 
by the president and is raising reagans absence at the trial as an 
issue on appeal 
north could not identify a single instance where president 
reagan directly told him to formulate a false chronology or to 
commit other obstructions said the court filing 
norths almost total lack of direct contact with the president 
is apparent from evidence collected by walshs office and from 
norths own testimony at his trial said the prosecution

two farmers in the berkshire hills are 
selling stock in a piece of summer marketing 10 notes redeemable 
in fruit and vegetables at their produce stands starting in june 
the pay now eat later approach is more or less the same one 
employed by the chicago futures markets only on a tiny scale 
the notes will give farmers a shortterm loan over the winter 
when business is slow and costs such as heating greenhouses are 
high said susan witt of share a nonprofit group that works to 
improve the regions economy 
they also will help build the customer base for the stands owned 
by don ziegler and dan tawczynski she said 
the dollarbillsized berkshire farm preserve notes which went 
on sale thursday are green and decorated with handdrawn fruit and 
vegetables and the slogan in farms we trust 
they cost 9 but will be worth 10 when redeemed in june july 
and august at the ziegler and tawczynski stands in western 
massachusetts 
its really being used as a selffinancing tool witt said 
its a way of saying no we dont have to be dependent on 
federal loan programs state loan programs we the customers can 
support the businesses that we shop at ourselves 
in october share was involved in a similar project great 
barrington delicatessen owner frank tortoriello made a successful 
issue of deli dollars certificates worth 10 in future food at his 
establishment he needed to raise money to move the delicatessen 
agriculture commissioner august schumacher jr launched the 
farmers issue by buying two notes thursday with the notes came 
promotional literature calling on consumers to invest now in your 
summer cravings for berkshiregrown plants and veggies 
im intrigued with it schumacher said i think we 
certainly want to support the communitys efforts to support their 
local farmers im looking forward to seeing how it turns out 
at the tawczynski stand called taft farms about 700000 in 
sales were rung up last year said martha tawczynski but winter 
costs are high with 3000 gallons of oil burned this year already 
to keep the greenhouses warm 
turning to the community rather than to a bank to raise spring 
seed money came naturally to the farm families mrs tawczynski 
said 
these are just local people theyre our friends she 
said we get to know people across the counter 
ziegler and tawczynski had been discussing the idea for some 
weeks but the it took on urgency when a severe fire destroyed part 
of zieglers stand earlier this year 
his stand the corn crib is operating again but money has been 
tighter than it usually is during the nonproductive winter months 
ziegler said 
youre always spending more money than youre beginning to 
make he said 
if the farm notes work for the two farmers share hopes to 
extend the program to other local operations witt said 
the idea seems right for this area its a flexible idea and 
other people have taken it up and seen how they could use it and 
that is encouraging she said 
the concept may be limited to tightly knit areas such as the 
berkshire hill communities she said 
its a rural new england area that likes to help out itself 
she said its local connections are very strong and thats why it 
works

battles raged a day later between popular forces and those loyal to 
the soviet blocs last dictator 
hundreds of people were reported killed in the fighting 
a provisional government apparently with the militarys full 
backing was in control in most places but still encountered fierce 
resistance from proceausescu security forces in several cities 
bucharest radio reported 
the popular forces took control of the communications centers on 
friday and arrested key figures from the ceausescu regime but 
there was no clear word on the fate of ceausescu and his wife 
elena formerly the secondincommand

earlier in the day the chief of the dreaded securitate secret 
police gen iulian vlad told the nation on bucharest radio that 
the interior ministry had rid itself of elements loyal to the 
ceaucescu clan 
he appealed to security troops who long terrorized the 
population at ceausescus command to serve the highest cause 
namely the defense of the entire romanian peoples freedom 
however fighting flared in the capital at dawn saturday 
apparently between army units at television headquarters and 
ceausescu loyalists in surrounding apartment buildings 
about 230 am saturday ceausescu loyalists had tried to seize 
radio and television headquarters about two miles apart but 
army troops repulsed the attacks 
the facilities were take by popular forces friday and were 
broadcasting declarations from the countrys newly declared 
provisional government that included a vow to embrace democracy and 
hold free elections next year 
heavy fighting was reported continuing saturday in brasov the 
countrys secondlargest city it had also reportedly been intense 
friday night in the western city of timisoara where the revolt 
began on dec 15 
on friday morning ceausescu fled his presidential palace as 
hundreds of thousands of romanians called for his death in 
retaliation for the massacre of their countrymen in a military 
crackdown unleashed a week ago in timisoara 
the yugoslav news agency tanjug said ceausescu was hunted down 
and captured although it gave no details there was no 
confirmation of the capture in romanian media and the whereabouts 
of the man who ruled romania with an iron fist since 1965 were 
unknown 
the death toll in the uprising was believed to be in the 
hundreds in addition to the thousands of civilians killed since 
the start of the unrest television broadcast an appeal to doctors 
and medical students to go to city hospitals to help the injured 
the tumult capped a historic year of change in the soviet bloc 
that elsewhere was relatively bloodless solidarity took power in 
poland hungary ousted its communist hardliners and opened its 
borders and oldguard regimes in east germany czechoslovakia and 
bulgaria were thrown out in swift succession 
provisional leader ion iliescu appeared on romanian tv along 
with other members of a national salvation committee that the media 
said was formed to run the country temporarily iliescu an old 
acquaintance of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and former 
foreign minister corneliu manescu said free elections would be 
sought by april 
in a few days we shall calm down bury our dead and will be 
consciously building new free and democratic life the soviet 
news agency tass quoted romanian poet mirca dinescu as saying 
besides free elections the national salvation committee said it 
was committed to a pluralistic society continued membership in the 
warsaw pact the idea of a common european home an idea 
espoused by gorbachev abolishment of all structures of the 
ceausescu dictatorship and placement of the army and the security 
apparatus under the control of the civil government 
romanian media now pledging honest reporting said ceausescu 
and his wife fled the palace by helicopter early friday the palace 
was later was set ablaze 
it also was reported they had fled the country but tanjug said 
late friday night that they had been captured along with other 
ranking members of the old guard it was not known where they were 
china on saturday denied giving sanctuary to ceausescu 
nicu ceausescu was shown on tv with a bloody face his arms held 
by a civilian and a man in a uniform he was then taken away by his 
captors 
when security forces attacked the radio and tv headquarters in 
bucharest during the night occupants of the tv building ducked as 
shots were fired toward the windows and the lights went out 
rebel soldiers inside returned fire pinning down the security 
forces and repulsed the attack after about two hours 
the tv station stayed on the air during the attack with 
reporter victor ionesco exhorting residents of bucharest to come to 
scene of the shooting come help us he implored were 
helping you 
people who had been chanting outside the tv building only 
minutes before the shooting scattered briefly during the attack 
but they came back and cheered when tanks on side of the uprising 
took up new positions around the building rebel troops also were 
located on the buildings roof 
a crowd of about 3000 people then took up a vigil through the 
night outside the building continuing their chants for liberty 
maria elena ionesco the tv reporters wife said the attack at 
the radio station also was put down its over weve won weve 
won she said 
maj gen stefan gusa the first deputy defense minister who 
joined the uprising said on bucharest radio saturday morning that 
the army and the people are in control of the situation although 
there are still scattered pockets of opposition in the country 
a source in timisoara said proceausescu commandos dropped by 
parachute had descended on the town and tanks were rolling into 
downtown tanjug later reported the fighting had died down 
in brasov official radio broadcasted an urgent appeal for rebel 
reinforcements bucharest radio reported heavy fighting around the 
central telephone exchange 
the 24year reign of the east blocs harshest regime collapsed 
in one breathtaking week of protests that began with a small rally 
for a persecuted pastor in timisoara and led to fridays nationwide 
uprising by millions 
only last month ceausescu was overwhelmingly reaffirmed as 
supreme leader by a fiercely obedient communist party conference 
that paid homage to his personality cult on thursday during a 
speech in central bucharest he was shouted down by jeering 
demonstrators 
after ceausescu fled bucharest friday morning hundreds of 
thousands of jubilant romanians rallied in the capital for hours 
even as there were reports of fighting between rebel troops and 
proceausescu forces about 2000 proceausescu forces then

congressional ban on loans to iraq is likely to antagonize 
lawmakers critical of iraqs human rights abuses and credit 
problems 
officials say president bush will exercise his right to lift the 
ban imposed by congress several months ago on grounds of us 
national interests the officials who spoke friday on condition of 
anonymity said the move is expected within several weeks

pressure on the administration to broaden trade ties with iraq 
since the 1988 end of its ruinous eightyear war with iran

credits to iraq by the exportimport bank a us government 
institution that promotes the export of american goods to head off

discredited by nicolae ceausescus harsh 
rule and its central role as his loyal cheerleader the communist 
party in romania appears to have little chance of staying at the 
helm 
ceausescu who had ruled since 1965 and cut off any attempt at 
organized opposition was overthrown friday in fierce battles that 
left hundreds dead 
in the bloodiest decision during his long rule ceausescu 
ordered the use of lethal force one week ago against protesters in 
the western city of timisoara who demanded his ouster 
security forces there reportedly killed several thousand people 
including many children and woman and dumped their bodies into 
mass graves in a forest near the city 
ceausescus use of deadly force intended to perpetuate the last 
stalinist regime in eastern europe at any cost contrasted sharply 
with recent communist responses to protesters in other soviet bloc 
countries 
police in east germany czechoslovakia and bulgaria did not fire 
on proteters 
romania is different in many ways from its warsaw pact allies 
ceausescu created a personality cult around himself that seemed to 
entwine his own political survival with that of the communist party 
much like north koreas kim il sung ceausescu created a family 
dynasty in romania with some 40 relatives reportedly placed in key 
state and party jobs 
in romania the communist party existed only to clap and cheer 
ceausescu it hardly was a political party said ion ratiu 
chairman of the londonbased world union of free romanians 
after ceausescus ouster the communist party will likely 
crumble unlike in czechoslovakia poland and east germany where a 
degree of divergent views was tolerated said a romanian exile at 
the usfinanced radio free europe radio station 
mircea stoica a professor at bucharest university who this week 
defected to hungary said a party congress last month where 
ceausescu was unanimously elected for another five years was 
actually 90 percent organized and run by the secret police 
the 5000 delegates to the congress before entering the 
palace hall were searched for alleged weapons like common 
criminals and had to pass through metal detectors what bigger 
humiliation for a communist do you want stoica said 
on friday ion iliescu a former central committee secretary 
ousted by ceausescu in 1971 announced the formation of the 
national salvation front described as the new organism of 
state power 
we will establish a new structure of political power the old 
structure of party and government was liquidated iliescu told a 
bucharest crowd 
we will establish a provisional structure which will prepare 
free elections in which the people will be the decisive factor for 
our public life he said 
in a late night statement broadcast live by romanian radio and 
television iliescu said the front includes all healthy forces in 
our country and is supported by the army which rallied with the 
people against ceausescus security forces

blandiana dumitru mazilu rev laszlo toekes the protestant 
pastor of hungarian extraction whose persecution sparked the 
revolt former foreign minister corneliu manescu exwashington 
ambassador silviu brucan and three army generals 
iliescu said the front urges the abandonment of the leading role 
of a single party the organization of free elections by april and 
changing the countrys name to romania rather than the socialist 
republic of romania 
iliescu 59 reported to be an old friend of soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev from the years when both studied in moscow 
made no mention of the communist party an indication that 
ceausescus former fiefdom will play little if any role in future 
i know how opportunistic communists are after ceausescus 
ouster tens of thousands of them will throw away the red cards 
saying they hated the party and its leaders said sandu 
poberzenic of the world union of free romania 
the communist party has currently a membership of 38 million 
members 
addressing each other friday after ceausescus ouster army 
generals and other officials used the word domnul mr rather 
than the word that until now has been mandatory comrade 
the romanian communist party had been the weakest in the whole 
of eastern europe before the war when it numbered less than 1000 
members ratiu said its policy on international issues often 
ran counter to romanian national aspirations 
still it was not known how and what other parties will be set 
up in romania to contest the planned elections next year 
the fronts platform made no mention of the countrys former 
king michael now 67 and living in switzerland it emphasized that 
a committee will immediately start working out a new constitution 
we must learn how to function as a democracy said dissident 
poet ana blandiana now a front member lets cleanse the shame 
and humility in which we were forced to live in the past 24 years

a county judge described as toughminded 
and outspoken was injured by a pipe bomb delivered to his home but 
authorities said the case appeared to be unrelated to four other 
recent bomb attacks 
washington county circuit judge john p corderman listed in 
stable condition today isnt known to have handled civil rights 
cases the presumed motive in the earlier attacks one of which 
killed a federal judge 
corderman 47 suffered shrapnel injuries to his abdomen and 
right hand and both eardrums were ruptured in the blast in his 
thirdfloor apartment about 230 pm friday said chuck jackson 
maryland state police spokesman 
apparently the device was situated outside when he arrived 
home jackson said he retrieved it entered the apartment and 
a short time later it exploded we dont know whether it was opened 
or not 
despite his injuries corderman left the apartment and activated 
a fire alarm about 10 feet outside his front door before collapsing 
inside the apartment jackson said 
a second bomb that apparently was in the package was taken to a 
nearby city park and detonated 
george hopgood an assistant fbi special agent in charge said 
the latest bomb was dissimilar to the ones that have been found in 
the south 
at this time there doesnt appear to be any connection 
hopgood said 
investigators are checking the possibility the earlier bombings 
could have suggested such an attack to some with a grudge against 
corderman jackson said 
in the earlier cases a nailpacked mail bomb killed judge 
robert s vance of the 11th us circuit court of appeals dec 16 
at his home outside birmingham ala and a similar bomb killed 
black civil rights attorney robert e robinson two days later at 
his savannah ga office 
parcel bombs were found during the week at the jacksonville 
fla chapter of the national association for the advancment of 
colored people and the 11th circuit courthouse in atlanta where 
vance sat both were defused 
federal investigators believe the attacks were motivated by the 
victims or groups role in civil rights cases 
vances colleagues also have received threatening letters 
sources told the associated press on friday investigators 
disclosed thursday there had been four followup threatening 
letters but refused to divulge who received them 
in washington justice department spokesman david runkel said he 
was unaware that letters had been delivered to judges on the 11th 
circuit but he said solid evidence linked the letters to the 
bombers 
the threatening letters had references to a group called 
americans for a competent judiciary the atlanta journal and 
constitution reported today citing anonymous sources familiar with 
the investigation 
the group isnt known to authorities said william hinshaw 
special agent in charge of the fbis atlanta office 
washington county lawyers said they didnt recall corderman 
dealing with civil rights cases 
hes the kind of gentleman who you like him or dont like 
him baltimore attorney chris brown said he has rubbed people 
the wrong way 
brown said the judge takes unusual stances and gives lawyers a 
hard time hes a very colorful outspoken controversial judge 
said to be tough with criminal defendants corderman is a board 
member of the center to prevent handgun violence a gun control 
group 
washington county states attorney m kenneth long described the 
judge as nononsense toughminded fair bright and 
articulate 
long who had lunch with corderman shortly before the blast 
said the judge was in good spirits when he visited him later at 
washington county hospital where he was under 24hour guard 
he was trying to smile and trying to chuckle but it was 
difficult long said hes grateful to be alive 
a neighbor of cordermans steven keyes 30 said he saw a 
delivery man bring a package to the building about 20 minutes 
before the explosion 
it looked like a normal person to me a normal delivery 
keyes said

contract talks between the san diego union and 
the tribune newspapers broke off after a strike deadline passed 
early today but labor officials say theyve decided against 
walking out at this time 
discussions ended after company lawyers rejected a proposal from 
the newspaper guild in which the union dropped its demand for a 
closed shop a key issue in the talks 
union leaders said a strike could be called any time 
representatives of the guild and the uniontribune publishing 
co met all day friday without reaching agreement company lawyers 
told guild officials they didnt plan further proposals at this 
time setting the stage for a possible strike which would be the 
first in the 51 years the guild has represented employees at the 
two newspapers 
pay is less an issue than disputes over the length of the 
contract and preservation of a union shop 
the companys last proposal called for a oneyear pact with 
salary hikes of 8 percent to 10 percent said herb klein editor in 
chief of the copley newspapers a 13paper chain that includes 
those involved in the dispute 
the guild sought a threeyear contract with a 10 percent pay

the energy department has removed one hurdle 
to a 78 million settlement with neighbors of the fernald uranium 
processing plant and revealed another obstacle the fact that no 
funds are available to pay it 
the government announced friday night it was dropping its appeal 
of the settlement with 14000 people who live around the southwest 
ohio plant they sought the payment for alleged emotional distress 
and loss of property values because of radiation releases from the 
plant 
but stephen a wakefield chief counsel for the energy 
department also said the justice department had advised him this 
week he couldnt pay the 78 million from a federal contingency 
fund as planned because the lawsuit wasnt brought against the 
government 
the original lawsuit targeted national lead of ohio inc which 
ran the plant under federal contract until 1985 but the companys 
operating contract with the energy department shielded it from 
liability in such cases 
the department will have to ask congress for a special 
appropriation to cover the settlement wakefield said payments 
probably will be made in installments he said 
thats terrible said paul nemann one of three 
courtappointed trustees overseeing the settlement government 
lawyers promised when the lawsuit was settled last summer that the 
money would be available by october he said but that month the 
energy department appealed the settlement 
residents included in the settlement were happy the government 
had dropped its appeal 
we think its really past time said lisa crawford my 
question is when are they going to put the money in the bank 
the plaintiffs contended in a 1985 lawsuit that releases of 
radioactive material from the plant which processes weaponsgrade 
uranium had reduced their property values and caused them 
emotional distress 
the settlement clears the way for federal funds to pay for 
longterm medical monitoring of the health of the 14000 people 
living within five miles of the feed materials production center at 
fernald 18 miles from cincinnati 
doctors will study whether an excess of cancers or other health 
problems can be traced to radiation released from the plant which 
has operated for 38 years 
the plant currently is run by westinghouse materials co 
operations were suspended earlier this year to intensify cleanup 
efforts at the site

state television said today that the 
soviet union had promised military aid to the popular forces that 
ousted nicolae ceausescu and fighting in fierce battles with elite 
police units of the ousted dictator 
an announcer said without elaboration that the soviet embassy 
had pledged such aid but did not elaborate on whether it would be 
in the form of troops or equipment in moscow soviet media did not 
report such an offer 
the announcement followed an appeal broadcast by the television 
from an unidentified army general who urged moscow to step in 
because terrorist units loyal to ceausescu had sent 
reinforcements to the capital 
hundreds of people were killed in clashes in bucharest between 
the army which sided with the revolt against ceausescu and police 
forces that included ceausescus personal antiterrorist squad 
as dawn broke over bucharest anticeausescu soldiers posted 
atop the tv building fought with pockets of loyalists in nearby 
apartment buildings in a firefight that lit up the early morning 
sky 
the generals appeal came shortly after 6 am as the 
anticeausescu forces repulsed an attack on the television 
building which the popular forces seized on friday and from which 
they broadcast plans to hold free elections by april

a statefunded abortion program that had 
been sliced in half earlier in the year ran dry this week 
curtailing for six months the only statefunded abortion program in 
the southeast officials said 
the legislature cut the fund during its summer session from last 
years level of 924000 to 424500 for the fiscal year and the 
last funds were spent tuesday john tanner of the state department 
of human resources said friday the new fiscal year begins july 1 
north carolina is one of only 11 states in the country that has 
a fund for abortions for poor women 
republican state rep paul stam who led the budgetslashing 
effort in summer said the house had rejected an amendment he 
offered that would have eliminated statefunded abortions for birth 
control purposes 
if the fund had been limited to pay for abortion in cases of 
rape incest or where the mothers life is threatened it would 
have lasted through the fiscal year he said 
what we have done over the last 5 months is spend 96 or 98 
percent of the money on birth control abortions so there is no 
money left stam said its a crazy way to allocate the funds 
firstcome firstserved 
i think it just reinforces that there is a great need for the 
fund countered state rep sharon thompson a democrat it is 
tragically unfair that whether or not you receive help from the 
fund depends on what time of the year you get pregnant 
poor women have few choices left with the state funds gone said 
ruth ziegler of the national abortion rights action league 
our organization would like to see that every woman in this 
state that feels the need to make a choice to have an abortion 
would have freedom to make a choice ms ziegler said we feel 
rich women as well as poor women should be able to make that 
choice

members of the panamanian defense forces 
stacked their guns and raised a white flag in panamas westernmost 
city even though the only sign of us force was two air force 
planes that buzzed the barracks 
i was just doing my job im not happy about the situation 
said one police officer who refused to give his name the police 
are part of the defense forces that were commanded by ousted 
dictator manuel antonio noriega 
although noriega was toppled from power by us forces early 
wednesday he escaped the net thrown by 24000 us soldiers 
sailors and marines 
no us troops showed up in david despite reports of shooting 
and fighting in the area 200 miles west of panama city and 30 
miles east of costa rica 
on thursday two air force jets buzzed the defense forces 
barracks in the center of david witnesses said 
on friday members of the defense forces raised a white banner 
across the front of the barracks and 100 turned in their weapons 
except for sidearms 
they just stacked their weapons in a pickup truck said 
carlos antonio rios a photographer for the houston chronicle who 
had entered panama from costa rica a small crowd gathered in front 
of the barracks and waved american flags during the afternoon 
rumors that noriega himself was in the area were rife during the 
day but none could be confirmed rumors that he had been captured 
were scotched by us army spokesmen defense forces members said 
they didnt know where noriega was 
unlike in panama city there were only scattered incidents of 
looting local residents said largely because members of the 
defense forces continued to police the streets at one point 
defense forces members blocked the entrance to a store and 
prevented armed men from entering 
if they want me to work ill work said the defense forces 
policeman when asked if he would work for the newly installed 
president guillermo endara if they dont i wont whatever

a moveable span on a floating bridge opened 
unexpectedly during a test thrusting a steel wall in front of 
rushhour traffic and causing pileups that killed one woman and 
injured at least six other people 
department of transportation officials were at a loss to explain 
the wreck on the evergreen point floating bridge across lake 
washington during a test that has been conducted weekly for 18 
years without a hitch the test of electronic circuits doesnt 
involve moving the span 
but during fridays test the span rose 4 feet without warning 
in about three seconds creating a wall that three vehicles drove 
into headon 
raili korkka 44 was killed police said three people were 
hospitalized in serious but stable condition with a variety of 
injuries and three others were either treated at the scene or 
briefly hospitalized according to police and hospital officials 
motorist mark bauty said his car bounced over the lip of the 
drawspan just as it started to open and he could hear tires 
screeching and metal crunching behind him 
the bridge was probably six inches high i guess when i hit it 
and the car made it over the front end kept right on going and 
flew off the back end when the bridge was probably about a 
footandahalf to two feet high bauty said 
several cars were left perched on the elevated section of the 
bridge some with blown tires and mangled metal from hitting the 
rising span no cars went into the water 
operator error has been just about ruled out in the 850 am 
accident said department spokeswoman leslie salisbury who 
explained the bridgeopening sequence requires 18 distinct steps 
when the operator got to the 10th step for some reason one 
part of the drawspan opened up she said 
transportation department crews ran through the procedure three 
times friday afternoon and every time we got to that step the 
drawspan opened salisbury said 
the step should not have involved the drawspan mechanism at all 
she said one expert likened it to turning on your windshield 
wipers and having the radio come on instead salisbury said 
the 25yearold 2milelong bridge is supported for 7000 feet 
on concrete pontoons making it the worlds longest floating 
bridge two steelgrid spans each 100 feet long can be raised 
about 7 feet to make room for boats to pass beneath 
preliminary inspections didnt turn up any damage but workers 
plan to inspect the bridge further on tuesday and to close the 
bridge briefly in january for a more detailed look salisbury said 
the department also has recommended an independent consultant be 
hired to investigate 
the operator of the bridge has been with the department for 10 
years and has run the bridge for one year following two years of 
training salisbury said 
the operator was distraught and was treated by medics 45 minutes 
after the accident said daryl rush district bridge maintenance 
superintendent for dot 
opening the drawspan which creates a 200foot opening is 
necessary only 30 to 40 times a year because most vessels can pass 
under elevated portions of the bridge at each end rush said 
evergreen point bridge formally known as the albert d 
rosellini bridge carries an average of 100000 vehicles daily

the first revolts against nicolae ceausescu that 
led to his downfall occurred in the western romanian city of 
timisoara where thousands were said to have been killed by troops 
here is a report from the city by an ap correspondent who traveled 
overland from yugoslavia 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the people who began the revolution 
that toppled nicolae ceausescu danced and cheered when he fled 
bucharest then cried bitterly over mass graves filled with the 
victims of the dictators henchmen 
the bittersweet celebration occurred friday in timisoara the 
western city where thousands were reported killed in protests that 
spread nationwide 
residents hurled the omnipresent portraits of ceausescu onto 
bonfires that blazed around town they fed the flames with signs 
ripped down from buildings that praised him and bore his platitudes 
on building communism 
this is something we never expected to happen said resident 
ingeborg kziraska the dictator is gone 
the streets of the transylvanian city still showed signs of the 
bloodbath that occurred when ceausescus security forces opened 
fire on demonstrators last weekend shops were burned out and 
official buildings heavily damaged 
kziraska spoke outside the cathedral where she said 30 children 
had been gunned down 
inside the cathedral a memorial service was under way with 
about 2000 people attending religious freedom and other civil 
liberties were severely curtailed under ceausescus draconian 
rule 
residents in the city estimated friday that 2000 to 4500 
people had been killed although there was no way to verify those 
figures police reportedly had opened fire on crowds shouting 
bread and down with ceausescu 
but romanian radio which was in the hands of the people who 
toppled ceausescu said today that more than 12000 people were 
killed in timisoara alone since the uprising began dec 15 with 
demonstrations in the city 
yugoslav media said soldiers and police who refused to fire on 
antigovernment protesters in timisoara were executed 
the city itself became a symbol and its name was chanted at a 
huge anticeausescu protest in the capital of bucharest on thursday 
hundreds of people were digging up mass graves discovered in the 
forest district of timisoara trying to find the remains of their 
friends and relatives killed in last weekends crackdown 
three such mass graves are believed to be holding up to 4500 
corpses of people massacred by the dreaded security forces on 
saturday sunday and monday 
vasile todorescu an electrician said he was trying to find his 
20yearold son who disappeared during the unrest he said corpses 
had been transported by garbage trucks to the area and the drivers 
were later shot by the police so that no witnesses whould be left 
civilians wearing ribbons on their sleeves were attempting to 
maintain order in timisoara as people danced joyfully in the 
streets and flashed v for victory signs 
many rode around in trucks people waved romanian flags with the 
socialist emblem cut out of the middle others carried banners 
calling for an end to repression 
on thursday timisoara was reported in the hands of a strike 
committee that reportedly had occupied factories and official 
buildings 
but on friday all 350000 residents of the city that is 30 miles 
from the yugoslav and hungarian borders and 500 miles from 
bucharest seemed to be on the streets 
intellectuals had formed a committee for socialist democracy 
this week that presented to premier constantin dascalescu a series 
of demands for ceausescus resignation free elections and full 
investigation of the weekend shooting 
the intellectuals had also demanded the admission of foreign 
journalists to romania and publication of its demands 
western reporters allowed into romania on friday for the first 
time since the unrest was reported and the bucharest leadership 
sealed the countrys borders saw that nearly every other shop in 
timisoara had been gutted several official buildings had been 
devastated 
the protests in timisaora grew out of an attempt by a few 
hundred people dec 15 to prevent the arrest of a reformed church 
pastor who had sought refuge in his church 
the whereabouts of the ethnic hungarian clergyman the rev 
laszlo toekes was unknown until friday when hungarian radio 
reported that he was alive and was on his way to the transylvanian 
city of tirgu mures to celebrate services nearly half of the 
population in that city is ethnic hungarian

a federal court ruling could mean 6 more 
years in prison for two brothers found guilty of bank fraud in the 
collapse of their northern california savings and loan a 
prosecutor said 
the ruling by us district judge robert peckham made public 
friday found leif and jay soderling guilty of contempt of court 
and violating their probation for indulging in a 500000 spending 
spree during a courtordered freeze on their assets 
the ruling should send leif and jay soderling of windsor north 
of san francisco back to prison for 6 years said prosecutor 
ronald smetana because of the violation of probation conditions in 
their original sentence 
the soderlings lawyer richard freeman could not be reached 
friday 
in 1987 the brothers pleaded guilty to bank fraud and were 
sentenced to seven years in prison but most of the sentence was 
suspended and they spent about nine months in prison before their 
release last year 
smetana said the soderlings owe about 48 million out of 67 
million in restitution required by their sentence and are being 
sued by federal bank regulators for additional amounts lost in the 
failure of their golden pacific savings and loan in 1985 
peckham said the soderlings violated his order requiring them to 
cooperate with the federal deposit insurance corp in paying 
restitution and prohibiting them from spending any of their assets 
without court approval except for 2500 per family in living 
expenses 
the judge said family trust funds created by the brothers spent 
500000 between september and december 1988 shortly after the 
order was issued without seeking court approval or notification 
the money was used among other things to buy cars computers 
cellular phones and a horse trailer peckham said 
the brothers argued that the money was spent by their wives and 
that the trust funds were immune from restitution jay soderlings 
wife evelyn and leifs wife sydney are awaiting trial 
separately for contempt of court 
rejecting the soderlings claim that they were not given notice 
of the terms of their probation peckham said they appeared to 
believe they can continue to push the line of legality in new and 
creative ways and the burden is on the government to anticipate 
every possible maneuver

romanias uprising turned into a 
battle for the airwaves today as members of ousted dictator 
nicolae ceausescus despised security forces tried to retake 
national television and radio stations 
national television showed the bloody faces of some people

injuries resulted

school officials censored a 
studentrun newspaper that ran several stories on sex education 
which were deemed inappropriate including one that explained how 
to use a condom 
principal richard white at holmdel high school said he met with 
the eightstudent editorial board of the sting on friday and agreed 
to allow the paper to publish without the three stories in question 
on jan 2 when classes resume 
craig lacava the newspapers 18yearold editor said the 
articles were prompted by the 800student schools inadequate sex 
education program 
we get a week of it freshman year then a good course that 
lasts several weeks during senior year lacava said by then 
its much much too late 
we decided to do this because we think parents should know how 
uniformed their kids are about these things he said we were 
very concerned about the pregnancy and abortion rate in our 
school 
i had agreed the students had a valid issue said white 
but one article in particular on skills and techniques of using 
a condom was just inappropriate for a school newspaper 
the articles one each dealing with sexually transmitted 
diseases sex education curriculum and condoms were described by 
lacava as explicit but accurate 
it was our feeling that it had to be explicit said lacava 
theres no other word for penis 
the newspaper staff had showed the articles to white the 
previous week lacava said adding he left the meeting feeling that 
white was shocked but would still allow them to be published 
but on tuesday just before we were going to go to the 
printer dr white came in and said we wouldnt be allowed to do 
it lacava said 
lacava and his coeditor 17yearold m liwanag querijero 
decided to take the proofs to the printer despite whites 
objections 
we felt strongly enough to defy him lacava said 
bill sachs owner of fast copy printing center in keyport where 
the paper is normally printed said a school official came to the 
shop wednesday and asked him to hand over the proofs he refused 
about an hour later he said he received a call from the school 
board warning that he could lose his contract if he did not turn 
over the proofs 
they made it clear i had to turn them over he said 
white said no disciplinary action is contemplated against lacava 
or miss querijero 
i wanted them to proceed at a slower pace and do a series of 
articles rather than to broadside the thing and alienate allies 
they might have needed later on to make real changes he said 
the limitations of the sex education courses result from a 
sort of combination of political and educational decisionmaking 
he said parents think teaching kids about sex will promote 
promiscuity thats a constant theme we battle 
but the issue of reforming the curriculum is now solidly on the 
front burner he said i think theyve made their point that what 
we have is too little too late

the arctic air that strained power supplies threatened orange 
trees and brought misery to the homeless today delivered an encore 
of polar blasts and record low temperatures and what could be a 
white christmas in tampa fla 
there was supposed to be global warming but i dont think 
anybodys seen it this month weather service forecaster edward 
yandrich said in new york the greenhouse effect took a hiatus 
the coldest dawn on record broke over some us cities but the 
siberian express that whistled over the pole through the yukon 
and stalled in the midwest should be jumpstarted over the weekend 
by a warm front trickling over the rockies 
snow was falling or forecast from central florida to the 
carolinas and west fo mississippi but in other areas east of the 
rockies todays lows should be followed by a prechristmas respite 
wilmington nc had more than 4 inches of snow on the ground 
this morning and up to 8 inches was forecast by afternoon far 
surpassing the record for the date the snow closed the coastal 
citys airport 
in nebraska the weekend forecast called for christmas day 
temperatures in the 40s seemingly tropical compared with the 
40plus below recorded friday morning 
the cold snap has caused at least 67 weatherrelated deaths 
around the country 
snow flurries whitened the florida panhandle cities of 
pensacola tallahassee apalachicola milton and crestview early 
today said brian maher of the national weather service 
up to 4 inches of snow were forecast for jacksonville where the 
alltime record is 2 inches southern florida which has escaped 
the cold until now was due for a snap with a freeze forecast 
sunday in miami 
people are pouring in said jeanetta pratt of the city 
rescue mission in jacksonville we dont turn anyone away we 
will find a place for them 
citrus growers were nervous jogged by memories of the 3 
billion in damages from hard freezes in 1983 and 1985 
the timing is not good we have a lot of fruit on the trees 
and a lot of concerned growers said dick whalley of florida 
citrus mutual in lakeland 
texas 30 million citrus industry was also threatened 
a sheet of ice and up to 2 inches of snow today covered 
georgias golden isles normally a holiday haven of winter golf 
among the palm trees officials closed icecovered causeways 
cutting off three of the islands from the mainland 
cold records were snapped in more than 125 cities friday a low 
of 23 degrees below zero made it the coldest day ever in kansas 
city mo 
at rochford high in the black hills of south dakota the 
unofficial reading was 60 degrees below zero the weather services 
official low was 47 degrees below zero at broadus and hardin mont 
the alltime record low in the united states is 80 below at 
prospect creek alaska on jan 23 1971 and in new york city 
where it was a brisk 8 friday morning a soviet emigrant said he 
wasnt impressed 
this is nothing said dora romadinov in moscow its much 
colder look theres no snow the sun is out 
the ragsandriches atmosphere of midtown manhattan took on a 
particularly poignant air with many of the citys 80000 homeless 
people crowding into shelters and train and subway stations to keep 
warm cheek by jowl with welldressed christmas shoppers bustling 
from boutiques 
a homeless man in tennis shoes fished for spare coins in a 
fountain across the street families traipsed into radio city music 
hall for the christmas show 
outside city hall demonstrators erected four tombstones to mark 
the deaths of four homeless people who died of exposure while 
sleeping in subways last weekend 
these tragic deaths have gone virtually unnoticed and we more 
affluent new yorkers seem to have let our hearts grow colder and 
more hardened than the bitter winter said david beseda of the 
coalition for the homeless 
around the country thousands were without heat or power because 
of outages caused by overdrawn current ice on the power lines and 
other problems heating oil shortfalls were reported at terminals 
throughout the northeast 
at the southeast kansas branch experiment station near parsons 
the cold was making it difficult to keep water for the cattle from 
freezing luckily none of the cows at the station were about to 
give birth 
it would be a rude awakening to come into the world now 
said station head lyle thomas that would be quite a temperature 
drop 
records lows friday included pittsburgh at 12 below tulsa 6 
below oklahoma city at 4 below denver at 18 below and 
scottsbluff neb at 42 below 
records are nice but who the hell wants to stick around when 
theyre there said george matuella of the weather service in 
omaha neb

a jury found a man guilty of involuntary 
manslaughter in his pit bulls killing of a 2yearold boy in what 
the prosecutor said was the first such case 
the santa clara county superior court jury on friday acquitted 
michael berry 39 of seconddegree murder after a day and a half 
of deliberations berry had been the first pet owner in the country 
charged with murder because of an animals actions according to 
deputy district attorney dale sanderson and the humane society of 
the united states 
berry who could have faced 15 years in prison if convicted of 
the murder charge was also found guilty of owning a mischievous 
animal cultivating marijuana and keeping a fighting dog 
judge james flaherty set a january sentencing date berry could 
be sentenced to up to 4 years and 8 months in jail 
sanderson told reporters he was satisfied with the verdicts and 
that im glad we ran with the murder charge 
berry was charged in connection with the june 13 1987 death of 
james soto his neighbor who wandered into the berry yard and was 
mauled to death by berrys 4yearold pit bull willy 
the dog which was kept in a locked cell during the trial was 
not as lucky as his master willy according to the county humane 
society was to be killed and was kept alive during the trial only 
because he was evidence 
berry claimed during the trial that the dead boys parents 
shared blame for the fact that the boy was allowed to get near the 
pit bull which was tethered to a stake in the yard 
what we have is a guy who raises a dog that is bred for 
aggressiveness and to be a combatant sanderson said during 
berrys arraignment and knowing the dogs propensity he places 
him in an area accessible to all including children 
sanderson acknowledged that there was no evidence of any actual 
malice by berry or intent by him to kill the soto boy but said the 
prosecution was based on a theory of implied malice that he said 
allowed a murder conviction against someone whose actions showed 
wanton disregard for human life 
the state court of appeal agreed that berry could be tried for 
murder 
during a search of berrys home authorities said they found 
several publications on illegal dog fighting and a dogsized 
treadmill

thousands of east berliners poured through 
new berlin wall border crossings at the brandenburg gate today for 
a final frantic day of christmas shopping in the wellstocked 
stores of the west 
other berliners headed for home after singing and dancing late 
into the night at the newly opened gate which has been transformed 
from a symbol of germanys divisions into one of eastwest 
rapprochement 
although visafree travel for west germans to east germany 
technically does not take effect until sunday there were few 
formalities at the brandenburg gate opened only friday for those 
who headed east today 
throughout the night friday a steady clink of metal against 
stone accompanied the merrymakers as hundreds of souvenir seekers 
chipped away at the berlin wall near the gate in the 28yearold 
berlin wall 
at other crossing points east german shoppers laden with 
purchases from west berlin carried christmas presents cases of 
beer and bags of oranges 
west german television periodically carried live coverage of the 
festivities friday night showing the crowd dancing on top of the 
wall popping champagne corks and waving sparklers 
west german chancellor helmut kohl and east german premier hans 
modrow met friday for the second time in a week at a ceremony 
formally opening two border crossings in the wall just north and 
south of the towering gate 
security collapsed as soon as the two crossings were opened 
thousands of people pushed down metal barriers erected to control 
the crowd and swept through the vast paris square snaking through 
the gate and climbing the wall 
west berlin police estimated that more than 30000 people had 
gathered on the western side for the ceremony the crowd on the 
eastern side appeared to be much larger but there were no official 
estimates 
although more than 20 border crossings have been cut through the 
berlin wall since east germany opened its borders to the west on 
nov 9 the opening of the brandenburg gate was the emotional 
climax of the rapid merger of the people divided since the end of 
world war ii 
the openings resulted from a popular uprising in east germany 
that drove out its hardline communist leaders 
when the berlin wall was built in 1961 the brandenburg gate 
berlins most famous landmark that straddled a main prewar 
thoroughfare remained in the east it was also inaccessible to 
east berliners until friday because it was part of the offlimit 
east german border zone 
the crowd carried berlin west german and east german flags one 
large sign saying in english come together was held aloft by 
several people who climbed atop the wall 
the thick section of the wall directly in front of the gate 
remains but hundreds climbed on top to dance and hug in joyful 
scenes reminiscent of the time when the borders were first opened 
in november 
kohl said the opening of the gate was a fantastic thing 
he and modrow met friday afternoon on the border line shook 
hands and then walked together to a platform to address the crowd 
the two leaders were nearly mobbed by the exultant crowd as 
security officials tried in vain to establish some control 
the ceremony was broadcast live on both countries national 
television 
this is where the heart of berlin pounds said a commentator 
for west germanys zdf network 
modrow reminded the crowd of the role the gate has played in 
german history then said its new function should be to serve the 
peace 
kohl said this is the happiest day in my life because i feel 
that here in berlin i am standing in the middle of germany 
we need the sympathy the support and the approval of our 
neighbors as the two germanys move closer together he said we 
want peace and freedom 
the speeches were drowned out by the noisy crowd many people 
had tears in their eyes as they mingled together 
berlin have fun now west berlin mayor walter momper told 
the crowd

pressure remained elusive 
the bush administration said it launched operation just 
cause to bring him to the united states to face federal drug 
trafficking charges restore democracy and protect the 35000 
americans living in the country 
the government that was sworn in tuesday night requires us 
protection and has no police or army to back it indicating it may 
be some time before a working democracy is built in panama 
the dignity battalions joined by an unknown number of noriegas 
once 15000strong defense forces were putting up a tougher battle 
than us officials anticipated 
gen maxwell thurman chief of the us southern command said

ap correspondent candice hughes had just arrived 
at the marriott hotel when the us attack on panama began at 
midnight tuesday she was taken hostage by forces loyal to gen 
manuel antonio noriega then rescued by us paratroopers 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the invasion of panama made targets 
of us citizens and the marriott hotel became a choice hunting 
ground for supporters of gen manuel antonio noriega 
minutes after us troops attacked the panamanian defense 
forces a squad of men with ski masks and assault rifles began 
prowling the hotel 
by the time paratroopers of the 82nd airborne division arrived 
24 hours later more than a dozen guests had been kidnapped and 
others had become hostages to fear 
i found myself taken hostage hunted held incommunicado 
looking down more gun barrels than i care to count rescued and 
evacuated 
these words began it the united states is invading were 
looking for american hostages 
the speaker was the squad leader and he had come to the right 
place the marriott panama citys most comfortable hotel was host 
to a corps of journalists and the usual complement of foreign 
travelers 
he and his cohorts settled on a dozen of us seven turned out to 
be us citizens 
we tried to persuade them to tell their side of the story the 
point of view of those being invaded and attacked we went in 
search of a telephone so we could call the associated press but he 
and his men had knocked out the phones 
but we had made a personal contact that might just might make 
it harder for him to kill us 
we were taken to a private home in noriegas neighborhood 
it was not so bad we were not blindfolded beaten verbally 
abused or tied up our captors gave us water and returned borrowed 
items like pens or cigarette lighters with courtesy 
always present however was the very real possibility that our 
situation would turn suddenly worse 
at one point a kidnapper put the barrel of his ak47 assault 
rifle to the head of the new york times correspondent lindsey 
gruson 
a lot of panamanians have died we can kill you he said 
dont think we wont 
at another point when i turned to console a captive who was 
weeping another kidnapper leveled his assault rifle at me inches 
from my nose and held it there for what seemed like two or three 
lifetimes 
around 4 am nearly four hours after we were taken hostage 
the sounds of fighting outside diminished the phone rang 
its over the squad leader said we dont want to dirty 
ourselves we are going to let you go 
he crouched in front of us tears in his eyes there are 
hundreds of dead at the central barracks the defense forces 
headquarters he said hundreds of dead 
we were put into two vehicles and freed at different locations 
i gruson paul iredale of the reuters news agency and three 
businessmen were dropped on a curbside two blocks from noriegas 
mansion 
fighting continued in the streets and we hunkered at a hedge 
trying to devise a strategy for getting back to the hotel more 
than a mile away someone shot at us from a gas station across the 
street 
we dashed around the hedge to an apartment building and began 
ringing every bell a frightened doorman appeared and waved us away 
with a pistol we continued ringing buzzers and someone inside 
decided to open the door 
a brave family let me into their apartment i was in heaven no 
one was pointing a gun at me and the lady of the house made coffee 
there was a view of the main battle area the defense forces 
headquarters several miles away and i was able to report by 
telephone to our office 
as we drove back to the hotel i felt terrific alive unharmed 
and free at last to report panamas dramatic story 
the next thing i knew a gang of civilian noriega supporters 
from the dignity battalions raided the hotel i looked down 
from my 10th floor window to see three hostages face down in the 
back of a toyota pickup truck full of armed men 
there was no way out trying to walk away seemed foolhardy while 
gangs of thugs were scouting for american hostages gruson and i 
barricaded ourselves in my room i called the us embassy and my 
office in new york to explain the situation 
the hotel was totally unprotected there were 30 or more us 
citizens the dignity battalions had said they would come back 
they didnt but that did not mean we were relaxed at about 4 
pm 12 hours after id been freed the first time some hotel 
workers came to the room 
the marines will be here in about two minutes they said 
hurry 
we went down the hall to a room where an eastern air lines 
pilot jay skinner his crew of seven and about 20 other americans 
were waiting skinner was on the telephone to an eastern crisis 
center in miami 
as it turned out i was a hostage again this time of the 
terrified eastern crew 
time passed and it was clear no rescue was imminent but skinner 
and the crew refused to let us use the telephone or leave the room 
saying it would jeopardize their safety to have americans elsewhere 
in the hotel 
if they capture you and torture you you will tell them where 
we are a flight attendant said 
fear had overcome them during hours they spent in the hotel 
laundry where some had tried to disguise themselves as bellboys or 
chefs 
a flight instructor screamed at me and shoved me against the 
wall when i tried to explain why i wanted to make a telephone call 
our offices in mexico city and new york were worried 
gruson and i got out after four hours when food was brought to 
an adjoining room we dashed into the room grabbed the telephone 
and called our offices 
skinners call to his crisis center finally paid off about at 11 
pm with the arrival of 90 paratroopers from bravo company 2nd 
batallion 405th infantry 82nd airborne division 
the soldiers handed out soft drinks cookies and fruit from the 
hotel kitchen checked to see if anyone needed medical care found 
blankets and pillows and got everyone settled 
they gotta go through us to get to you and they cant do 
that an officer said 
after more than 24 hours in combat the men of battlin bravo 
exhibited such a degree of courage kindness and courtesy that i 
decided to call on them every time i needed saving 
next mornings evacuation was fast and frantic a sniper had 
shot one of the soldiers minutes before the paratroopers piled 110 
guests and hotel workers into two marriott airport food service 
trucks and we barreled down the road to the ruins of an old fort 
about three miles away 
several hours later a chinook troop transport helicopter landed 
on the nearby beach in a cloud of green smoke from a marker 
grenade we hustled aboard and flew to howard air force base about 
eight minutes away 
finally i was free really free and i savored it like a 
spoonful of caviar 
my exhilaration faded as i saw what the fighting and looting had 
done to the city i saw gutted stores shattered glass smoldering 
ruins streets awash in garbage where armed bands roamed at will 
the story had just begun

the soviet union today sent medical supplies to 
romania and appealed to its warsaw pact allies to help support the 
uprising against nicolae ceausescu but it appeared to rule out 
military intervention 
the soviet news agency tass said wounded romanians likely will 
be flown to the soviet union for treatment and it warned that the 
fighting in bucharest had endangered the lives of soviets living in 
the romanian capital 
the first planes with medicines and urgent supplies have 
already arrived in bucharest president mikhail s gorbachev 
said but they still are being held up in the bucharest airport 
which is blockaded 
tass said gorbachev told the soviet parliament that the soviet 
government had decided to appeal to the governments of the warsaw 
pact states with the aim of coordinated efforts in providing 
support to the people of romania 
the soviet red cross ministry of health and other organizations 
were working with similar organizations in france and eastern 
europe to provide medicine and specialists he said 
gorbachev said a number of other measures were being worked 
out with warsaw pact allies and that a special working group was 
monitoring events in romania he provided no other details 
premier nikolai i ryzhkov dismissed talk of sending soviet 
troops to romania to aid the provisional romanian government that 
backed by the army declared itself in control after ceausescu fled 
bucharest on friday 
we have to support them from the point of view of medical help 
and maybe some other kinds of help but to bring in forces i think 
thats impermissible ryzhkov said 
we mustnt repeat mistakes the head of the soviet 
government told reporters not long ago we reevaluated the 
warsaw pact invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 that 
reconsideration was made on dec 4 and should we repeat something 
like that a few days later 
romanian tv in the hands of the rebels said earlier today that 
the soviet embassy had pledged to send personnel and equipment to 
aid the uprising 
the announcement followed an appeal broadcast by the television 
from an unidentified army general who urged moscow to step in 
because terrorist units loyal to ceausescu had sent 
reinforcements to the capital 
gorbachev indicated his country was just as confused as the rest 
of the world about the whereabouts of ceausescu who had ruled the 
allied country of 23 million people for nearly a quarter century 
tass said the fighting had put soviet trade officials and their 
families living in bucharest in serious danger 
the soviet union cannot remain indifferent to the fate of 
soviet citizens and demands that those who have unleashed the above 
actions endangering the life of the soviet people should 
immediately stop them tass said 
on friday the soviet parliament passed a resolution offering 
decisive support for the just cause of the people of romania 
hundreds of people were killed in clashes in bucharest between 
the army and police forces that included ceausescus personal 
antiterrorist squad 
soviet media have aggressively covered the uprising in romania 
providing readers and listeners with startling details of the 
battle for power 
correspondents of the official tass news agency have provided 
vivid eyewitness accounts of the battle between army units 
supporting the uprising and guard units loyal to ceausescu 
official television on friday night showed film of hundreds of 
thousands of romanians packed into the squares of downtown 
bucharest 
gorbachev has given his blessing to the political reforms 
sweeping eastern europe where one after another oldstyle 
communist regimes have fallen this year to the forces of democracy 
while ceausescus romania remained a part of the soviet bloc 
relations between gorbachev and ceausescu were notably cool 
they last met early in december in moscow when tass described 
their meeting in terms that left little doubt about their sharp 
disagreements

striking miners and the pittston co are 
hoping to reach a prechristmas agreement on a contract that would 
end a nearly ninemonth strike 
talks between the united mine workers and pittston resumed at 
midmorning today after breaking off shortly after midnight as the 
two sides sought to meet a mediators hope that the bitter and 
sometimes violent strike be settled by christmas 
principals in the talks did not speak to reporters because of a 
gag order but sources said considerable progress was made thursday 
and friday still an agreement has proved elusive because of 
outstanding disputes 
labor secretary elizabeth dole hoping an agreement was near 
delayed plans to travel to her native north carolina for christmas 
and remained in washington so she could participate if a settlement 
is announced it was dole who named the supermediator for the talks 
the two sides began aroundtheclock negotiations early this 
week and word that a settlement might be imminent surfaced at 
midweek as umw president richard trumka and pittston chairman paul 
douglas were called into the talks 
mediator wj usery pledged to seek a settlement by christmas 
that would allow the nearly 1700 miners from virginia west 
virginia and kentucky to return to work after the traditional 
holiday shutdown of the mines 
although the strike involves just 1700 miners it holds broad 
implications for the umw and the mining industry as a whole the 
dispute between the miners and pittston over retiree health 
benefits threatens to undermine a decadesold compact between 
mining companies and the umw guaranteeing retired miners full 
health benefits 
pittston last year refused to participate in the compact the 
bituminous coal operators association agreement because it 
objected to the new funding formula pittston was unable to reach 
agreement with the miners on an alternate plan and had stopped 
payments into union pension and medical funds 
usery a former labor secretary and veteran mediator was tapped 
as supermediator by mrs dole in late october shortly after she 
visited with pittston strikers in the virginia coal fields 
the dispute over funding the retirement plans led the miners to 
strike april 5 after 17 months of failed contract talks with 
pittstons mining subsidiary pittston coal group the miners had 
worked for 14 months without a contract when they struck 
the union has paid the strikers about 200 a week in benefits 
and is facing fines totaling 635 million for violating court 
orders limiting picketing and other strike activities last week 
the union said it would give each striker a 1250 christmas bonus 
sweetening a prior offer to give them interestfree loans 
pittston hired replacements to operate the mines but production 
has been well below prestrike levels and industry analysts said 
it appeared the company has been forced to buy coal to keep up with 
its supply commitments 
pittston reported that its coal operations lost 36 million in 
the second quarter of 1989 and 98 million in the third compared 
to profits of 9 million and 74 million in the respective 
quarters of 1988

rebel soldiers appeared the take 
control of timisoara on saturday and residents armed with knives 
and sharpened sticks roamed the streets of the city the cradle of 
romanias revolution 
medical personnel reported at least two people killed and six 
wounded from midnight friday to midmorning saturday in fighting 
between the army and holdout units of securitate the feared 
special police force of deposed leader nicolae ceausescu 
scattered gunfire continued in timisoara the nations 
fourthlargest city 
at the military hospital doctors spent the night anxiously 
listening to the crackle of automatic machinegun fire and barrages 
from tanks the sound of gunfire surrounded the building but the 
shooters were not seen 
they are here they are there they are somewhere in the park 
we dont know where they are and thats why its so frightening 
said a doctor 
the physician said she had been working without letup since dec 
17 when police and army units machinegunned thousands of 
civilians 
two days earlier a brutal police crackdown on timisoara 
prodemocracy demonstrators sparked protests that spread across the 
nation leading to fridays revolt against ceausescu by citizens 
and sympathetic army soldiers 
romanian radio said more than 12000 people had been killed in 
timisoara alone since the uprising began as in other soviet bloc 
countries seeking reform the protesters sought an end to 
dictatorial oneparty rule 
among the dead were 7614 people detained by proceausescu units 
and executed said the report which like others was impossible to 
verify 
tearful residents on friday congregated at freshly unearthed 
mass graves believed to contain the bodies of thousands of 
summarily executed victims some mutilated 
the streets on saturday appeared to be controlled by bands of 
citizens wearing armbands of the national colors of blue yellow 
and red they were armed only with knives clubs and sharpened 
sticks open trucks carrying army troops were a frequent sight 
buildings were decorated with romanian flags with their 
communist coatofarms cut out and with pictures of ceausescu 
behind bars 
a wounded man undergoing surgery for a bullet hole in his leg 
asked for military aid for the anticeausescu rebels 
we need guns and airplanes all fighting for us and not 
against us he said through a translator 
send rambo he said grimacing as the surgeon explored his 
wound 
another victim was a 33yearold doctor whose leg was shattered 
by a bullet as he was coming toward the hospital it appeared he 
would lose his leg 
you come to the hospital to help people and here i am as a 
patient he said 
he and other romanians asked a western reporter for anonymity 
in a reflection of the widespread anxiety that the revolution could 
be squelched and repression could return

romanian president nicolae ceausescu had already 
fled a popular uprising at home when thousands of miles away in 
china television still carried his last speech as if nothing had 
happened 
ceausescus sudden fall from power clearly took chinese 
officials by surprise the foreign ministry took more than 24 hours 
to issue a substantive comment and then said simply that it was 
following developments with interest and hoped to continue friendly 
relations with romania 
his fall also left chinese leaders more isolated than ever in 
their rejection of democratic reforms that have swept the socialist 
world this year but it was unlikely to shake their resolve to keep 
political power firmly in the hands of the communist party 
party general secretary jiang zemin speaking to hong kong 
publishers thursday implied that east european armies lacked 
strength to put down the uprisings chinas army by contrast 
underwent the test of lengthy revolutionary warfare and 
maintained strict political discipline he said 
as one communist party after another has been forced to share 
power in eastern europe jiang and other chinese leaders have 
insisted that chinas vast population and backward economy make 
socialism the only viable system 
in internal discussions according to the hong kong economic 
daily they concluded that east europes example only proves the 
correctness of chinas decision to use force against prodemocracy 
protesters in june 
individual chinese who heard foreign radio broadcasts of 
ceausescus fall applauded it but saw no hope that senior leader 
deng xiaoping would be the next aging autocrat to go we dont 
want violence said one noting the heavy fighting and death toll 
in romania given chinas size he said the bloodshed would be 
even greater 
in the end china was reserved in its support for ceausescu 
we believe that its romanias internal affair the 
foreign ministry said repeatedly as the protests swelled last week 
asked saturday if china would give ceausescu a safe haven the 
ministry said only that he had not come nor asked to it refused to 
say what it would do if he did ask 
ceausescu had been one of chinas most reliable friends abroad 
in the 1960s when the soviet union broke with china and took with 
it most of eastern europe ceausescu refused to take sides and 
maintained good relations with beijing 
when much of the world condemned chinas crackdown on 
prodemocracy protesters he applauded it and sent several 
government and party delegations to beijing qiao shi a top 
chinese party official returned the visits in november 
ceausescu was quoted frequently by chinas media with his 
denunciations of western imperialism closely matching those of deng 
and jiang chinese papers withheld reports on the violence in 
romania until it became clear he could not return to power 
a photo exhibit celebrating chineseromanian friendship opened 
with fanfare in a beijing park just one day before ceausescus 
ouster 
but friday as he fled by helicopter from his palace roof the 
exhibit was deserted and locked a visitor who rattled the door 
roused two surprised attendants

albanias state news agency on saturday 
issued an unusually frank report on the romanian revolt against 
dictator nicolae ceausescu whose regime had much in common with 
the albanian leadership 
with the ouster of ceausescu albania remains the last stalwart 
of stalinism in eastern europe 
but atas reporting indicated the present tirana leadership was 
at least not opposed to ceausescus reported ouster 
romania was the last member of the soviet alliance to be hit 
with the wave of reform earlier this year poland hungary 
bulgaria east germany and czechoslovakia each embraced liberal 
change 
the other two eastern european nations albania and yugoslavia 
are nonaligned nations 
yugoslavia broke with moscow in 1948 because its founder the 
late jozip broz tito espoused a less harsh brand of communism than 
stalin albania broke with the kremlin in 1961 to continue its 
orthodox stalinist course 
longtime leader enver hoxha led his country into increasing 
isolation and the nation of 3 million became one of the most 
closed societies in the world 
under ramiz alia who took over after hoxhas death in 1985 the 
country renewed diplomatic relations with dozens of countries and 
opened up somewhat to tourism but alia has continued to abhor the 
reforms in the soviet union and other eastern european countries 
the ata report quoted western and soviet bloc news agencies in 
its dispatch and noted that the soviet news agency tass had been 
unusually vivid in its reporting of the romanian situation 
the dispatch could indicate a further opening in the poorest 
nation in europe 
the news agency has not issued any editorial comment on the 
situation in romania 
ata has on previous occasions quoted western and other foreign 
news agencies but usually only in connection with the situation in 
neighboring yugoslavia where there is a large ethnic albanian 
population

when the atallah family opened its shop selling 
silver crucifixes and painted icons in jerusalems old city four 
decades ago almost all the neighboring stores were owned by fellow 
arab christians 
today only 20 of the 200 shops that line christian quarter road 
remain in christian hands says george atallah who is greek 
orthodox 
the churches of jerusalem could become museums if people keep 
leaving atallah warned 
a worrisome stream of emigration to the west has steadily 
increased encouraged by a rise in moslem fundamentalism and the 
pressures of the twoyear palestinian uprising 
the uprising has caught the christians in the middle as 
palestinians they are part of the antiisraeli revolt their 
children throw stones and are shot by soldiers they suffer 
economic hardship alongside the moslems 
but as the rebellion drags on without real gains islamic 
fundamentalism is strengthening and christian hopes for a secular 
palestinian state are fading 
christians wonder what they are going to do here if islamic 
forces continue to gain power said geries khoury director of a 
christian palestinian research center near bethlehem every day 
people are losing hope 
the christian community is particularly outraged at this weeks 
call by the moslem fundamentalist hamas movement for a general 
strike on christmas day and christian leaders say it will not 
block religious observance of the holiday 
more than 30 christian denominations have followers in the holy 
land led by the greek orthodox greek catholic and roman catholic 
churches 
monsignor michel sabbah the first arab to serve as the roman 
catholic bishop of jerusalem believes the diverse christian 
community needs special nurturing to prosper 
to be a christian in this holy land is a special vocation 
he said in an interview it is a difficult life because of the 
nature of the land always a land of wars a land of hostility a 
land of minorities and majorities 
the arab christians many descendants of the first followers of 
christ have been a troubled minority in the holy land since the 
moslem conquest in the 7th century 
in recent decades the christians have been further overwhelmed 
by jewish immigration and the moslems high birthrate 
israeli experts estimate that in 1947 there were about 650000 
jews 11 million moslems and 150000 christians in 
britishmandatory palestine 
since the founding of the jewish state in 1948 the jewish 
population has increased nearly sixfold and the moslems have more 
than doubled but the christian community numbering just 140000 
in israel and the occupied west bank and gaza strip is smaller 
than it was four decades ago government statistics show 
palestinian leaders insist the number is even lower noting 
traditionally christian towns like bethlehem and ramallah now have 
moslem majorities in jerusalem many christians retain their 
property but live abroad 
an official of israels ministry of religious affairs said the 
governments policy is to protect and encourage the christians 
the west was always very interested in the fate of the 
christians he said israel wanted good relations with the 
west with the christian world so it was in our own interest to 
watch out for the christians 
the official who insisted on anonymity blamed the christians 
increasing minority status on a low birthrate and the mixed 
blessing of ties to western churches that anger fundamentalists 
the palestinian uprising has heightened the christians problems 
many christians welleducated in church schools and often from 
prosperous merchant families found the deteriorating economy too 
much to bear says george shamas a syrian orthodox writer who has 
immigrated to the united states 
job opportunities are not available shamas said life is 
more difficult and people dont want to be stopped by soldiers and 
searched and jailed day in and day out 
still many christians take seriously their longstanding role as 
leaders of arab nationalism the christian town of beit sahour has 
been an example carrying out a much publicized tax revolt and 
boycott of israelimade products 
but joseph a beit sahour christian who has been jailed several 
times in the uprising worries that moslem palestinians do not 
appreciate the christian contribution 
there are efforts by some islamic groups to exclude us or 
maybe to limit our role in the uprising he said asking that his 
last name not be used 
he added you hear that christians are going to be equal to 
the moslems if independence comes in the future but i am sure that 
in reality it will not be the case 
islamic fundamentalism also is growing among israeli arabs fed 
by what moslems feel is discrimination by the jewish state 
municipal elections last year gave big gains to fundamentalist 
candidates 
christian arabs in israel have responded by forming a union of 
churches in the coastal town of haifa and the northern galilee to 
protect their position 
khoury the christian researcher says christians in the 
occupied territories also must ensure their place in a future 
palestinian state he calls on churches to play an active role in 
the uprising as moslem mosques do 
i am not seeking a christian solution khoury insists i 
am seeking a palestinian solution that includes christians

tucked away in the hills of southern 
scotland lockerbie is the kind of small market town that few 
american tourists would ever have known about had it not been for 
the bombing of pan am flight 103 
now many know its quiet streets verdant fields dotted with 
grazing sheep and familyrun shops as well as they know their own 
neighborhoods in new york detroit and the many other cities the 
victims called home 
because of the disaster close ties have been forged between 
many of the towns 3500 residents and bereaved american relatives 
there was a bond created that will last forever said joe 
horgan a philadelphia contractor whose brotherinlaw was on the 
doomed flight on dec 21 1988 
there were times when we lost our faith in our fellow man but 
you only have to come here to have it restored these people 
reached out in the midst of their own devastation and guided us 
all 259 passengers and crew members died when a bomb concealed 
inside a radiocassette player exploded in the planes forward 
cargo hold eleven townspeople were killed by fiery wreckage that 
plummeted 31000 feet from the winter sky 
local residents grieving for their friends and neighbors and 
still shocked by the destruction of their homes and streets did 
yeoman duty in the following days recovering bodies and wreckage 
later they laundered victims bloodstained clothing to be 
returned to relatives 
they formed a lockerbie friendship group to help anyone who 
needed to make the pilgrimage to the fields churchyards and farms 
where their loved ones fell they welcomed them provided 
transportation and as often as not lent an ear to listen or a 
shoulder to cry on

tomas lucas the last fullblooded kwaaymii 
indian has died at age 87 in the laguna mountains area that was 
home to his ancestors for centuries 
lucas who eagerly retold his tribes history and described its 
cultural traditions for audiences ranging from anthropologists to 
elementary school children died thursday said his daughter carmen 
lucas 
in his final days lucas contracted pneumonia she said 
he knew he was dying he told us so she said he told us 
of his disturbing dreams where he was surrounded by angels but 
when he reached out to touch them their wings turned to paper 
because lucas was the last fullblooded member of the dwindling 
tribe kwaaymii elders had forced him to learn and repeat the 
tribal history 
anthropologists and archaeologists came to hear his recounting 
of tribal history and many hours of his monologues were recorded on 
videotape during talks with children from a nearby school 
i guess that im the only one today that remembers the past 
he told a reporter last year i was the only child and no kids to 
play with 
at night i was bound to listen listen to stories listen to 
prayers by keeping my ears open as i most generally have i 
picked up quite a few things some things i wasnt supposed to know 
i heard anyway 
during world war ii lucas moved to san diego where he worked 
until he retired at age 70 he returned to the former kwaaymii 
reservation land where he was raised about five years ago 
beside carmen lucas is survived by a second daughter jacquelyn 
pfingst of san diego and three grandchildren 
an allnight wake was scheduled to begin at sunset wednesday 
followed by burial thursday at the former reservation burial

census director barbara e bryant views 
herself as head cheerleader for the team of statisticians 
interviewers geographers and demographers who will conduct next 
years massive effort to count and categorize the american 
population 
mrs bryant who took office last week after president bush used 
a parliamentary tactic to install her without senate confirmation 
says the groundwork for monumental task of conducting the 1990 
census has been laid 
what i can do now is be a cheerleader i am really committed 
to helping this bureau have a full and accurate count of the 
population she said adding that most of the planning going 
back to 1984 has been done by others 
the job has been complicated by the flow of immigrants and 
illegal aliens into the united states over the past decade after 
heated debate congress voted this year to include illegal aliens 
and military personnal stationed overseas in the census 
officials believe 16 percent of the population wasnt counted 
in 1980 including a disproportionately high number of blacks and 
other racial minorities who often are fearful about taking part in 
the census count 
the census bureau in an attempt to target such 
hardtoenumerate groups is trying to overcome their fear and 
suspicion by working through local grassroots organizations 
especially in urban centers 
some people dont believe the census is really confidential 
said mrs bryant then there are education and language problems 
with some segments of the population and other people just 
distrust the government 
she said every opportunity i have ill be getting the word 
out its confidential i promise 
mrs bryant 63 is the first woman director of the census 
bureau but shes accustomed to blazing trails in 1947 she became 
one of the first women to gain an editorial rank with a mcgrawhill 
publishing co magazine 
i was never the fulltime wife and mother type she said 
she married and took an 11year break to raise three children but 
continued freelance writing and editing 
she began as a science writer and editor but while pursuing a 
doctorate at michigan state university i got totally hooked on 
communication research and later joined market opinion research 
of detroit in 1977 she became senior vice president of the 
company whose president until recently was bush campaign adviser 
robert teeter 
mrs bryant says she does not consider herself to be a political 
appointee and that most of her projects with market opinion 
research were nonpolitical they included studies for 
universities presidential commissions government agencies and 
media organizations 
for municipal transit authorities she developed proposals for 
making city bus and subway travel more popular for national 
geographic and harlequin books she crafted strategies for 
increasing readership 
she conducted polls for detroit news organizations on issues 
ranging from casino gambling to putting a dome on tiger stadium 
i always felt if i were her age i wouldnt have the energy to 
run all over the country the way she does said james leiman 
another company vice president shes a driven upbeat motivated 
person 
some critics question the accuracy of polling but mrs bryant 
defends it 
you have to watch for people giving socially acceptable 
answers she says but the american public is basically pretty 
honest 
for relaxation mrs bryant swims half a mile a day and dabbles 
in gardening and cooking but shell have little leisure time for 
the next year as the census goes forward 
bush nominated mrs bryant for the census post in september but 
when congress recessed for the year last month the senate had yet 
to take a confirmation vote 
bush announced dec 7 he was giving her a recess 
appointment under the constitution an individual appointed by 
the president while the senate is on an extended recess can serve 
until the end of the following year without senate confirmation 
mrs bryant says she hopes to be confirmed next year and serve 
as long as bush wants her

after nicolae ceausescu took power in 
romania in 1965 the armed forces saw their role diminished and 
watched the dreaded security forces receive the best equipment 
training and pay 
the entire army of 180000 men turned against ceausescu in the 
popular revolt that ousted him friday and was fighting some of the 
most loyal proceausescu security forces bucharest radio reported 
other securitate troops were reported to have gone over to the 
army 
while territorial defense was emphasized under ceausescu 
defense expenditures were reduced and the government greatly 
expanded the armys role on building sites and in militarized 
sectors of the mismanaged economy such as the mines and 
coalfueled power stations 
the army also was used in romanian agriculture and on 
ceausescus pet projects such as the the black sea canal which 
turned out to be unprofitable 
after more than 20 years of ceausescus rule the army of 
romania has the oldest and poorest equipment of any east european 
state and it is not maintained at high standards thomas o 
cason said in a 1982 study of east european military forces 
published in wilmington del 
ceausescu had reason to distrust his army after several 
generals plotted to overthrow him in 1984 
romanian officials have said privately that the generals were 
apprehended killed and their bodies were thrown from a helicopter 
into the black sea 
knowledgeable romanians say the army is outnumbered by specially 
trained and recruited security troops numbering some 700000 men 
equipped with the most sophisticated warfare and paid three times 
the average romanians monthly salary of about 300 
the army is nothing compared with the degree of training of 
these shock troops which ceausescu disguised as military units 
wearing almost the same kind of uniform mirceas stoica a 
professor of law at bucharest university told the associated press 
after fleeing to hungary last week 
he said he learned this from a friend who is a security colonel 
and from other sources 
they said ceausescu kept thousands of these troops in each of 
romanias 40 counties and that he had several security force 
divisions around bucharest ready to intervene they were 
equipped with tanks helicopters and guns 
ceausescu grew increasingly securityconscious over the years 
as the number of public protests to his harsh rule intensified 
said mihnea berindei an exile historian living in paris 
army officers speaking on bucharest radio said friday they 
discovered a network of secret tunnels running for 25 miles 
between the party headquarters and ceausescus new palace casa 
republicii in downtown bucharest up to a lake in the northern 
part of the city 
entrances to some tunnels were masked by nondescript panels in 
subway stations the tunnels contained weapons caches and were used 
only by ceausescus most loyal security troops the radio said 
the radio appealed repeatedly to architects who had been 
involved in building such secret caches to come forward and divulge 
the layout to the army and other forces behind the anticeausescu 
revolt 
romania for many years has been one of the main training camps 
for arab and african commandos trained in guerrilla warfare as 
ceausescu formed cordial relations with plo leader yasser arafat 
and libyan leader moammar gadhafi 
several years ago ceausescu borrowed arab terrorist troops 
as a security precaution including arafats body guard of about 50 
men stoica said 
a romanian radio announcer saturday appealed to army units and 
the population to help defend the national radio station against 
arab troops 
foreign mercenaries arrived by helicopter during the night 
they were prepared in a secret training camp near bucharest by the 
biggest enemy of our nation ceausescu the announcer said

dictator nicolae ceausescu and his 
wife elena were captured by the army today one day after a 
bloody popular revolt swept them from power the new provisional 
government said 
ion iliescu a member of the provisional government known as 
the national salvation committee said on romanian television that 
the dictatorial family nicolae and elena ceausescu was 
captured 
referring to ceausescu as a poison hyena iliescu said the 
former hardline communist president who had ruled since 1965 and 
his wife the second most powerful person in the country under the 
old regime would be tried 
iliescu also announced the capture of emil bobu the third most 
powerful person in the country and ceausescus brother ilie 
formerly a deputy defense minister no other details on the 
reported captures were provided 
romanian radio like the television in the hands of the 
anticeausescu forces also swiftly reported the announcement of 
the captures 
if the nicolae ceausescus capture is confirmed the development 
should provide a big boost to army soldiers and civilians still 
battling betterequipped security forces loyal to ceausescu in 
fighting that has claimed hundreds of lives nationwide since the 
dictator was ousted friday 
ceausescu and his wife fled bucharest on friday in a helicopter 
from the roof of the presidential palace ending his 24 year rule 
their son nicu a regional communist party chief had already 
been captured and shown on romanian television 
before todays announcement numerous conflicting reports on 
ceausescu and his wife had said they were captured then escaped 
that they had fled the nation and that they were directing their 
forces from outside bucharest 
however todays announcement was the first definite word from 
the opposition that ceausescu was in their hands 
a provisional government comprised of generals and dissident 
politicians and backed by the army declared itself for democracy 
and free elections but was clearly having trouble maintaining 
control today 
bucharest radio and tv repeatedly appealed to people and army 
units to rush to the capital and aid soldiers outnumbered by the 
enemy security forces 
state television said the soviet embassy pledged personnel and 
equipment to aid the popular forces but czechoslovakias ctk news 
agency quoted the embassy as saying any aid would be restricted to 
food and other nonlethal material 
in moscow president mikhail s gorbachev said his country was 
standing by with assistance but he failed to promise anything more 
than medicine 
we have to support them from the point of view of medical help 
and maybe some other kinds of help but to bring in forces i think 
thats impermissible premier nikolai i ryzhkov said 
at least eight romanian embassies abroad switched loyalties to 
anticeausescu forces as the armed revolt entered its second day 
among them legations in moscow austria canada yugoslavia poland 
and israel 
romanian emigres in touch with bucharest said untrained 
civilians are being enlisted by anticeausescu forces 
we expect the army to win in the end but the ceausescu 
security forces are welltrained wellarmed and they are fighting 
for survival said mrs iolanda stranescu president of the 
british romanian association in london 
gorbachev said a number of other measures were being worked 
out with warsaw pact allies and that a special working group was 
monitoring events in romania he provided no other details 
fighting was fierce in bucharest where the army and civilians 
who took up arms were defending state television and radio 
headquarters and trying to capture the fire gutted presidential 
palace from ceausescu loyalists 
as dawn broke over bucharest anticeausescu soldiers posted 
atop the tv building fought with pockets of loyalists in nearby 
apartment buildings in a firefight that lit up the early morning 
sky 
rocketpropelled grenades slammed into the tv building and 
defenders answered with machinegun and rifle fire 
bucharest radio reported intense combat in brasov the countrys 
secondlargest city and fighting in another central city sibiu 
it said more than 12000 people had been killed in timisoara 
alone since the uprising began dec 15 with demonstrations in that 
western city 
scattered gunfire continued today in timisoara residents 
reclaimed the streets after the army appeared to establish control 
the slaughter of demonstrators by security forces in timisoara 
touched off in this country of 23 million people the quickest and 
bloodiest revolution eastern europe has seen in turmoil this year 
that has toppled oneparty communist rule in poland hungary east 
germany and czechoslovakia 
among the timisoara dead were 7614 people first detained then 
executed said the bucharest radio report which was impossible to 
independently verify 
the radio also announced that all political prisoners had been 
released 
the fighting in romanian cities today blocked urgently needed 
medical supplies the international committee of the red cross in 
geneva reported 
sokeswoman marjolaine martin said an red cross workers flown 
from geneva to bucharest with four tons of supplies friday were 
unable to reach the center of bucharest this morning because of the 
fighting 
ms martin said the red cross also had reports that trucks with 
medical supplies trying to cross into romania from hungary also 
remained blocked today because the borders are closed 
early this morning a tank belonging to the anticeausescu army 
units crushed veteran french television reporter jeanlouis 
calderon during the chaotic fighting outside the central committee 
headquarters 
calderon 31 was reporting on the clash when he was run over by 
one of about 30 armored vehicles that entered the square 
elsewhere in the capital an associated press reporter saw 
prouprising soldiers bring reinforcements of tanks and heavy 
artillery to direct against the presidential palace 
taxis with red crosses rushed the wounded to hospitals in the 
citys emergency hospital about 50 bodies were piled in one room 
most were civilians 
that was just one room in one hospital said producer 
wolfgang roehr of a british visnews tv crew at the hospital we 
saw trucks full of what must have been hundreds of coffins 
bucharest radio said military helicopters piloted by 
proceausescu forces dropped leaflets in the city center that 
warned the popular forces to stop before its too late 
the new government had arrested key figures from the ousted 
regime including the interior minister and the chief of the secret 
police who later went on national radio to urge support for the 
uprising

for 11089 you can watch a russian 
revolution once a minute in bangkok 
you can also do pretty much the same for less 9727 less to 
be precise but your version of the soviet army watch will come 
from taiwan and not moscow 
billed by its promoters as the most exciting fashion accessory 
of 1989 the genuine soviet army watch arrived in bangkok on dec 
1 but counterfeit versions have been on open street sale for 
several months now 
charnchai kheangprakhong manager of zurton international 
which markets the real soviet army watch in thailand said he is 
not worried by the flood of cheap imitations 
it is not a problem you can tell which is genuine and which 
is not there is a big difference in quality he said adding 
that he expects sales of the real watch to surpass 10000 in the 
first year 
it is a hot fashion item he said 
the fake watches came to thailand partly because of the big 
demand for them after the soviet army watch was launched in europe 
and the united states he said 
people couldnt get the real one here so they brought in the 
fake ones he said 
the latest symbol of glasnost is also the latest counterfeit 
item to be found on the streets of bangkok it vies with cheap 
imitations of rolex and cartier watches as well as hundreds of 
other products including old favorites like luis vuitton luggage 
and lacoste polo shirts 
most counterfeit products are made domestically but some 
imitation watches or watch parts are smuggled in from taiwan 
as one western businessman living in thailand remarked 
copyright here basically means the right to copy

president bushs order to send american troops 
into combat in panama initially greeted with broad support in 
congress could backfire politically if casualties continue to 
mount and the united states becomes bogged down there 
the dangers are clear 
how high will the us death toll climb will deposed ruler 
manuel noriega continue to evade us forces that were once 
confident of capturing him 
will the fragile government of guillermo endara installed by 
the united states but dependent on us power for his authority 
take hold 
how long before us forces can be withdrawn 
and what about american hostages 
the hazards were demonstrated after bush declared the situation 
pretty well wrapped up thursday and military officers described 
it as a moppingup operation 
on friday noriega loyalists attacked the headquarters of us 
military forces and gen maxwell r thurman commander in chief of 
the us southern command said us forces were still fighting a 
real war 
the stubborn resistance prompted the pentagon to order an 
additional 2000 soldiers into panama backing up a force of nearly 
24000 already there 
for now the political support for bushs action seems to be 
holding 
were in the adrenalinpumping stage the first 
rallyaroundtheflag moments said stephen hess a brookings 
institution senior fellow and specialist on the presidency there 
hasnt been any major downside but you can start seeing it coming 
university of virginia political scientist larry sabato said 
the first reaction is to support the president but then the 
doubts start seeping in and the worries and the questions 
william schneider a senior fellow at the american enterprise 
institute and a political analyst said the only question is 
whether its going to work and whether its going to work quickly 
americans dont like to make an openended commitment 
anywhere particularly where it involves the loss of american 
lives schneider said 
americans believe we should win or get out in grenada we 
won in lebanon we got out 
bush said us forces will chase noriega as long as it 
takes he said the deployment of combat troops in panama is 
openended as the chase continues and us forces try to restore 
some semblance of order to the country 
already there are demands in congress for american troops to be 
brought home quickly 
but rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said some us forces might have to remain as police 
until christmas eve a year from now 
a military operation initially described as a three to fourday 
mission now stretches into the indefinite future 
white house officials insist however that the operation is 
following the script they envisioned 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said gen colin 
powell the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff briefed bush 
last sunday on the risks and laid it out almost exactly as it 
materialized 
he said powell accurately predicted noriega would not be 
captured immediately that hostages might be taken and that there 
would be a protracted period before us forces would wrest control 
of panama city from noriegas panamanian defense forces and his 
socalled dignity battalions 
fitzwater also said the us death count will not be large 
it doesnt seem likely there would be largescale engagements 
with large amounts of casualties he said 
before the invasion us intelligence sources had reported that 
noriega was drinking heavily and that his mental state had 
deteriorated 
general noriega has been acting irrationally beyond his 
normal conduct said sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate 
armed services committee 
nunn said administration officials in private briefings for 
congress made a very strong case for the invasion however 
there are fears that public opinion may turn against bush if the 
operation drags on 
hess said bush probably doesnt have more than a month of real 
grace the trick is always that it doesnt become our war 
schneider the aei analyst said the best outcome for the 
bush administration would be for this guy to be dead not make 
trouble for anybody 
but the panamanian leader remains at large while us 
casualties mount and even if he is captured the onetime cia 
operative could make some embarrassing demands for secret documents 
if brought to trial in the united states 
he knows where a lot of skeletons are buried in central 
america and some of them may be very close to bushs office 
schneider said noting contacts between bushs vice presidential 
staff and key figures in the irancontra affair 
if noriegas caught schneider said thats not the end of 
the matter

in june a man convicted of selling nearly a 
half kilogram of crack went before us district judge robert 
sweet he spoke of his family and his wish to lead a productive 
life and he pleaded for mercy 
sweet who this month became the first federal judge to publicly 
advocate drug legalization reluctantly sentenced the defendant to 
20 years in prison bound by federal sentencing guidelines his 
frustration was evident 
i know of no basis upon which i could accede to your plea 
though i think it is entirely reasonable and i regret that 
intensely he said 
it is a mechanical task i am a clerk the judge complained 
his frustration festered along with the perception that the 
judicial system was being overburdened by a social phenomenon 
and so in a speech dec 12 sweet declared the war on drugs was 
bankrupt the lifelong republican and former federal prosecutor 
suggested that drugs like marijuana crack and heroin be legalized 
and treated like alcohol taxed regulated and made illegal for 
minors 
i suggest it is time to abolish the prohibition to cease 
treating indulgence in mindalteration as a crime sweet said in 
his speech more money more prisoners more addicts these 
numbers demonstrate to me our present prohibitive policy has 
failed flatly and without serious question 
the reaction was instantaneous the presidents drug czar 
william bennett condemned sweets remarks as stupid and 
morally atrocious vice president dan quayle denounced him 
gov mario cuomo said he considered legalization a sellout 
but others came to his defense 
i think hes a courageous man said baltimore mayor kurt 
schmoke all hes trying to do is get our country to admit the 
failure of current policy and to persuade national policymakers to 
consider a more efficient alternative to controlling drug abuse and 
drugrelated crime 
judge sweet has learned a great deal and is everywhere honored 
as a wise man and experienced jurist what he said needs thinking 
about wrote conservative columnist william f buckley 
both schmoke and buckley had previously supported legalization 
schmoke set off a firestorm in april 1988 when he suggested the 
idea to the us conference of mayors others who have broached the 
proposal range from former us attorney general ramsey clark to 
economist milton friedman to former secretary of state george 
shultz each has been targeted by critics 
sometimes at a reception or party i advance these views and 
people head for somebody else they dont even want to talk to 
you said shultz in an october speech to alumni of stanford 
business school no politician wants to say what i just said not 
for a minute 
sweets remarks were especially provocative because of his 11 
years on the federal bench to lawyers and judges who know him 
sweet is a thoughtful intelligent and fair judge whose opinion 
should not be easily dismissed 
the man is obviously in the eye of the hurricane said david 
breitbart an attorney who has represented clients before sweet 
if he says the war on drugs is a failure then he has seen it on a 
firsthand basis in the courts 
sweet did not answer numerous requests for an interview 
sweets experience with the drug problem dates back to the late 
1960s when as a deputy new york city mayor he helped supervise 
treatment programs for addicts recent sentencings reflect his 
continued belief in rehabilitation 
in october sweet imposed a oneyear prison term the lightest 
sentence allowed by the guidelines on a 29yearold man who 
pleaded guilty to taking part in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine 
noting that it was the first conviction for the employed father 
of two young children the judge said in a sentencing memorandum 
that any longer sentence would interfere with rather than 
facilitate rehabilitation 
sweet also ordered the defendant to undergo drug testing and 
treatment during three years of probation following his prison term 
his colleagues said sweets public stand for drug legalization 
would not affect his work as a judge 
chief judge charles l brieant of the southern district of new 
york said sweet would continue to be assigned narcotics cases 
the judges of the court are confident that judge sweet will 
honor his oath of office and administer the law as it stands 
said brieant a judge doesnt lose his first amendment rights by 
becoming a judge

the chinese government gave beijing catholics a 
christmas gift saturday returning st michaels church more than 
three decades after it was confiscated for secular use 
pale winter sunlight gleamed through the few remaining stained 
glass windows as more than 200 catholics led by bishop fu tieshan 
reconsecrated the 87yearold gothic building with song and prayer 
i cant see the music very well but i remember it said 
whitehaired brother zhang delong who played the new organ to 
accompany the choir as it sang a traditional latin mass 
the church its gray brick spires towering over a treelined 
street in central beijing was built in 1902 to serve the foreign 
diplomatic community the communist government seized it in 1958 
and made it a school 
other churches were closed in the 1960s during the farleftist 
cultural revolution that treated religion as a threat to communism 
st michaels is the fifth catholic church to reopen in urban 
beijing where nearly 40000 catholics live 
its return two days before christmas caps a year that tested 
chinese christians longstanding determination to keep out of 
politics 
some christians both catholic and protestant joined the 
prodemocracy marches of the spring a group of young catholic 
seminarians reportedly gave small amounts of money and food to the 
protesters and several protestants were arrested for their roles 
in the shortlived union set up by protesting workers 
but the church hierarchies appointed with government approval 
and closely watched kept silent even while other official organs 
such as the governmentrun union supported the democracy movement 
after crushing the protests in june the government cracked down 
hard on most of the traditionally suspect segments of society such 
as intellectuals but the churches which suffered in past 
hardline backlashes have been largely unscathed 
since june the governmentsponsored chinese catholic patriotic 
association which has no ties with the vatican has ordained six 
new priests boosting the number in beijing to 24 seven young 
women took vows as nuns the first to do so in beijing since the 
communists took power in 1949 
the events of june did not affect the church i believe thats 
because the church transcends politics said ying mulan vice 
secretarygeneral of the beijing catholic patriotic association 
we dont want to get involved in political activities she 
said in countries where most of the population is catholic such 
as the philippines she said churches may play a political role 
but in an officially athiest country such as china its best policy 
is to seek what common ground it can with the government 
bishop fu addressing the congregation in st michaels told 
them to pray for anding tuanjie stability and unity words 
used often by the government since june 
christians who reject the governmentsponsored catholic and 
protestant churches and worship in illegal house churches also try 
hard to be politically neutral 
in the spring we told the faithful three things dont go 
look at the protests dont speak and come to services said a 
protestant housechurch minister because of that he said police 
have not interfered with the sunday gatherings of his group of 
about 20 
but conflicts still arise periodically between the government 
and religious believers in contrast with st michaels peaceful 
transfer about 1000 catholics in central china tried on their own 
in april to retake a former church and were driven out by police 
catholic sources in hong kong said two people were killed 
the sources have reported at least four arrests this year of 
catholic clergy loyal to the vatican 
since june some high school and college students disillusioned 
with the communist party have begun attending christian churches a 
young man at st michaels said they come because they feel empty 
inside

the pentagon dispatched 2000 more combat 
troops into panama today in the face of continued unexpectedly 
stiff resistance from loyalists of fugitive gen manuel antonio 
noriega 
the fresh troops from the armys 7th light infantry division 
were being airlifted throughout the day from fort ord calif as 
us commanders in panama reported burgeoning concern over the 
harassing attacks and weapons supplies of noriegas socalled 
dignity battalions 
the new arrivals joined 24000 us troops already in panama 
many of them boneweary as the nations largest military force to 
see combat since vietnam faced a changed mission from 
conventional warfare to counterterrorism 
us military officials also reported that prisoners at an 
island penitentiary apparently had overcome their pronoriega 
guards and had radioed for help from american forces the prison 
group was said to include some of the former panamanian officers 
who led a failed coup attempt on oct 3 
pentagon officials put the us casualty count at 24 soldiers 
killed 238 wounded and two missing in addition they said two 
civilian dependents have been reported killed 
in panama city lt col jerry marguila spokesman for the us 
southern command said 139 of noriegas fighters had been killed 
though the panamanian defense forces were neutralized quickly by 
the us assault which began early wednesday noriegas hitandrun 
dignity battalions are increasing their activities of harassing 
attacks with small arms and mortar fire threatening the civilian 
population and hostagetaking he said 
when pressed for specific numbers marguila replied i dont 
have in my mind an increase in numbers between today and yesterday 
of dignitybattalion efforts its just that they are becoming more 
of a concern because they are taking more of our time as opposed 
to the pdf 
at the pentagon one military official speaking on condition of 
anonymity conceded the ferocity of the dignity battalions had 
caught us commanders off guard and he said that despite the us 
seizure of several large weapons caches it appeared that the 
noriega diehards still had access to fresh arms 
defense secretary dick cheney was at the pentagon on saturday to 
keep tabs on developments in panama as well as the bloody 
revolution which ousted romanian dictator nicolae ceausescu 
president bush was at camp david md where he worked on a 
christmas eve address to the american military men and women around 
the globe 
noriega meanwhile continued to defy capture despite a rash of 
rumors as to his whereabouts 
its simply a difficult operation there are a lot of 
places to hide lt gen tom kelly director of operations for 
the joint chiefs of staff said late friday 
the administration also offered what it said was new evidence of 
drug dealings by noriega including a 110pound stash of cocaine 
found near noriegas private office at a military barracks 
he is clearly not only a narcotrafficker but apparently he 
condones and uses the stuff himself said gen maxwell thurman 
the head of the us southern command in panama 
the noriega headquarters was described as opulent 
containing a movie theater jade art and jewels us troops also 
found a picture of adolf hitler in a closet and an assortment of 
occult and witchcraft paraphernalia according to us officials 
the fighting with noriegas outmanned supporters continued 
despite the presence of 11000 troops brought in wednesday to join 
the 13000 normally stationed there 
members of noriegas dignity battalions were waiting when 
first vice president ricardo arias calderon was leaving the 
national assembly on friday and fired shots at his car arias was 
not injured but two aides were wounded 
kelly said the us military is looking at reestablishing the 
police force he said his commanders estimated that clearing the 
city would take five to 10 days 
thurman in panama city said more civil affairs units were 
being brought to help reestablish civil systems in areas of 
economics public facilities and such special functions as 
displaced persons refugees and evacuees 
bush went to camp david md for the christmas holiday but 
white house officials said he would attend a briefing sunday at the 
pentagon 
bush was briefed by telephone saturday morning at camp david by 
national security adviser brent scowcroft on both the panama 
situation and developments in romania white house spokesman sean 
walsh said walsh provided no details of the briefing 
bush was scheduled to make a 5minute radio address over the 
armed forces network on sunday and walsh said part of the message 
would be directed at servicemen in panama 
bush plans to visit soldiers wounded in panama in a houston 
hospital on dec 31 
panamas new ambassador to washington carlos rodriguez moved 
into the embassy on friday after meeting with bush the keys to the 
mission were turned over to him by a state department official in 
late afternoon 
congressional leaders received briefings about the situation in 
panama by the pentagon state department and cia 
sen sam nunn chairman of the senate armed services committee 
said the briefing had underscored his support for the operation and 
said the administration made a very strong case for 
justification 
nunn said that beyond the initial reasons for the military 
actions cited by president bush there was evidence that general 
noriega himself has been acting irrationally beyond his normal 
conduct 
offers were made to noriega through diplomatic channels that he 
could leave for a third country one that has no extradition 
treaty with the united states nunn said he was given an 
opportunity another course not to have to confront the united 
states the senator added 
nunn said it was clear the invasion was launched without a good 
fix on noriegas whereabouts but called it a rare flaw in an 
otherwise wellrun operation 
both kelly in the pentagon and gen maxwell thurman in panama 
said an astounding cache of weapons was seized by american troops 
in noriegas headquarters 
one wonders what the intentions of noriega were the general 
said referring to the 10000 mostly eastern bloc weapons that were 
found he acknowledged that noriegas defense forces had put up a 
tougher battle than expected 
the remnants of noriegas armed civilian battalions he said 
are looting sniping they are lawless but he said im 
satisfied its under control were not getting anything we cant 
handle

on a frosty christmas eve some years ago author 
cleveland amory was in ill spirits manhattan sparkled with a fresh 
blanket of snow but it didnt matter he wasnt a man prone to 
merriment and he was alone 
but that night a woman rapped on his door asking for help to 
catch a cat in an alley between two midtown towers 
amory reluctantly followed her outside and amid the debris he 
saw the cat a ghost of a cat really bonethin dirty wet and 
shivering he put the cat in his coat and he turned for home 
so begins a true tale called the cat who came for christmas 
and so began a relationship that changed cat and curmudgeon 
now the book is on a new york times bestseller list for the 
third consecutive christmas climbing to no 2 in the newspapers 
paperback nonfiction category more than 15 million copies have 
been sold 
the relationship now in its 12th year has never been so 
trusting or so set in its ways 
the story details their first year together including the 
trouble in naming the white cat polar bear was eventually agreed 
to the trouble in traveling with a cat the trouble with putting 
a cat on diet food and the trouble with having guests 
polar bear though had no trouble in laying down the law amory 
must adjust to a life of being catowned 
he has 
you cant help but be because they suddenly are in control 
said the 72yearold amory who had always owned dogs 
amory a big bear of a man with thick gray hair brushed 
straight back from his broad forehead is the founder and head of 
the fund for animals the new yorkbased anticruelty society has 
been instrumental in saving infant harp seals in canada wild 
burros in the grand canyon and wild goats on navyowned san 
clemente island off the southern california coast 
the former newspaper reporter and editor also wrote six books 
including the proper bostonians the last resorts and 
who killed society he turned his attention to animal rights 
more than 20 years ago after seeing a bullfight in mexico and a 
bunny bop in harmony nc in which townspeople encircled 
rabbits and clubbed them to death 
amory spends much of his time now selling his christmas book 
one day last week he gave 13 radio interviews in a little more than 
two hours in each interview he mentioned the tens of thousands of 
animals in shelters and on the streets in need of homes 
his story about polar bear one reader wrote has been 
responsible for more cats being saved or adopted than any other 
book 
that letter meant more to me than any of the others amory 
said in an interview in his onebedroom apartment overlooking 
central park the apartment is full of polar bears toys little 
stuffed mice balls on a string catnip pouches theres also 
polar bears christmas tree decorated with cat cards 
greeneyed polar bear hes somewhere between 12 to 14 years 
old was at his feet hes plump despite diet dinners and he 
isnt very friendly leaving the room after a pat from a visitor 
he doesnt like anything that hasnt happened before and he 
doesnt need to meet any people he hasnt met before said amory 
i think hes gotten to be more of a oneman cat 
and amory is a onecat man they seem to have taken on some of 
the same attributes in their advancing ages theyre both a bit 
slower afoot and a bit quicker to snap he has acquired some of 
my worst traits amory said like my quick temper hes 
certainly developed toward being a curmudgeon 
this night before christmas like past ones amory plans to 
venture out around new york while polar bear sleeps he is on a 
mission for animals 
one year he persuaded police to order carriage horses off the 
streets because of bitter cold 
this christmas eve hell look down alleys for other polar bears 
every christmas eve i think about finding him he said 
stroking his cat ill be looking terribly careful for strays

the ouster of romanias hardline communist 
regime caps five months of political upheaval that rocked eastern 
europe the events demonstrated the kremlins new attitude toward 
countries it once treated like virtual fiefdoms here is a report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it was the fortress stalin built from the baltic 
to the adriatic it held some 100 million human souls two days ago 
its last bastion fell stormed by hundreds of thousands of 
romanians enraged by nicolae ceausescus tyranny 
though the brutal security forces that kept ceausescu in power 
for 24 years fought back across the country killing hundreds it 
was clearly the culminating act of a revolution that may deprive 
the term soviet bloc of any meaning 
a new order in europe in the making through 40 years of 
repression and economic failure suddenly is being born with the 
blessing and connivance of president mikhail s gorbachev 
in the 19th century another european who thought in 
continentwide terms the french emperor napoleon dreamed of a 
continental system to integrate the territory he conquered from 
spain to russia the philosophical father of communism karl marx 
predicted a proletarian revolution would sweep europe 
now gorbachev one of marxs ideological heirs preaches the 
creation of a common european home where after years of kremlin 
domination the nations of eastern europe will be virtually free to 
pursue policies they set themselves 
the fundamental changes of 1989 mean that the five east bloc 
countries must set up new governments reorganize economies and 
begin to work out what kinds of relations they will have with the 
soviet union what ties will be forged with western countries the 
events in east germany raise the special issue of a reunified 
germany in the heart of europe 
gorbachevs vision supplants agreements by the world war ii 
allies that led to the continents division into east and west 
after the defeat of nazi germany 
for more than four decades with the red army serving as its 
gendarme sovietstyle communism reigned in eastern europe from the 
bug river on the sovietpolish border to the german city of weimar 
where bach wrote his great fugues europe seemed immutably divided 
into socialist and capitalist camps 
the west set up a military alliance nato to deal with any 
military threat and the members of the communist bloc formed the 
warsaw pact 
the schism of europe had its hated symbol the berlin wall it 
made concrete winston churchills alarmed rhetoric in 1946 when he 
told students at a small college in missouri that from stettin in 
the baltic to trieste in the adriatic an iron curtain has 
descended across the continent 
true there were rips in that curtain when yugoslavia in the 
late 1940s and later albania successfully rebelled against moscows 
domination but the most stunning changes awaited the advent of 
gorbachev and the whirlwind year of 1989 
beginning in august hardline regimes were ousted in poland 
bulgaria east germany czechoslovakia and finally romania roman 
catholic tadeusz mazowiecki became polands first noncommunist 
premier since world war ii 
czechoslovakias new government is no longer 
communistdominated and hungarys parliament has approved 
democratic multiparty elections next year 
in berlin millions of east germans have poured through newly 
cut breaches in the wall personifying the growing symbiosis 
between east and west berliners sang and danced with joy friday 
night when an opening was made in the 28yearold wall near the 
brandenburg gate long a symbol of germanys division 
the five months that remade politics in eastern europe passed 
with breathtaking speed with gorbachev in power leaders like 
czechoslovakias milos jakes and bulgarias todor zhivkov who 
bankrupted themselves by failing to meet human or economic needs 
could no longer count on kremlin support 
without that backing unpopular communists had to compromise 
with the people or give up power 
in 1942 josef stalin raged that the nazis had turned europe 
into a prison of nations but it was the soviet dictator his 
army and his political disciples who would subjugate central europe 
and its inhabitants after driving out the german invaders 
in a sense revolt began a month after stalins death on an 
april morning in 1953 east berlin construction workers from the 
stalinallee site went on strike over pay cuts within 48 hours the 
protests spread throughout the city with demonstrators chanting 
we want to be free and not slaves mobs tried to take over 
government headquarters 
the soviet army commandant in berlin proclaimed a state of siege 
and two motorized divisions occupied the city protesters who were 
caught were executed order was restored by 9 pm and the red 
army moved to crush worker revolts in leipzig dresden and 
elsewhere 
the scenario was repeated in hungary in 1956 and czechoslovakia 
in 1968 when red army soldiers were sent in to stop reform efforts 
but this fall when east german leader erich honeckers rule was 
menaced by a popular uprising soviet troops remained in their 
barracks and honecker was deposed oct 18 
it was renewed proof of gorbachevs professed unwillingness to 
meddle in the internal affairs of his allies as well as a way of 
getting rid of an old guard communist who rejected much of his 
reform agenda 
the truth about which we spoke so often in the past few 
years has been reaffirmed once again where there is a delay in 
dealing with overripe problems excesses are inevitable 
gorbachev told soviet communists dec 9 warning them their east 
european colleagues fall from power means they must urgently solve 
domestic problems 
the soviets stress the countries they once treated as virtual 
provinces of their own nation must remain in the warsaw pact 
meaning europes age of the blocs is not yet over at least 
militarily 
but with noncommunist leaders seeking a mix of capitalism and 
socialism to better their citizens lives the eastwest 
ideological schism is dying

after their time under lights christmas 
trees in vermont are being put out to pasture and on the garden 
and around the shrubs on the front lawn 
more than 8000 trees were ground up into bits of bark and 
needles during last years merry mulch project and officials 
say the practice is catching on nationwide as a way to save 
landfill space 
its definitely an idea thats spreading said kate 
finleywoodruff marketing representative for the vermont 
department of agriculture 
the statewide program was started last year as an experiment by 
her department and the states agency of natural resources to 
encourage recycling 
we were overwhelmed by the response finleywoodruff said 
queries have come in from around the country about the program 
while some communities already turn christmas trees into wood chips 
for a second year sanitation workers in chicago will collect 
discarded trees for mulch indianapolis has been mulching trees 
since it canceled its christmas tree bonfire on twelth night a 
few years ago 
in vermont the state increased the number of dropoff and 
chipping sites from nine to 33 this year residents who want to can 
take their mulch home 
the state is getting help for merry mulch from several 
municipalities electric utilities ice cream maker ben amp jerrys 
homemade inc and regional solid waste managers and planners 
finleywoodruff said the program developed from the problem of 
solidwaste at landfills and a desire to help vermonts christmas 
tree growers 
were trying to protect their market so people dont get 
discouraged from buying a real christmas tree because of the 
landfill problems she said 
nationwide 343 million christmas trees were sold last year and 
the us agriculture department expects sales to exceed 35 million 
this year artificial trees were introduced in the 1950s and by 
1985 held 47 percent of the market 
pam dwyer executive secretary of the new hampshirevermont 
christmas tree association said the state may be scaring people 
into buying artificial trees 
i dont have a problem with merry mulch dwyer said but 
i think it leads people to believe that christmas trees are a solid 
waste problem 
it takes a christmas tree about 30 years to decompose in a 
landfill according to the american christmas tree journal an 
artificial tree contains petroleum products and may never 
decompose dwyer said 
weve tried to push the idea that christmas trees are a 
renewable source dwyer said im a foresters wife and im not 
convinced that wood products are a solid waste problem 
as for her tree dwyer said she laces it with bread and puts it 
in the yard for the birds when the family is finished with it

poland has formally agreed to overhaul its 
economy in exchange for 700 million in immediate credit from the 
international monetary fund and the promise of billions more in 
western aid officials said saturday 
deputy prime minister leszek balcerowicz and the chairman of the 
national bank of poland wladyslaw baka signed a letter of intent 
that was approved by the imf executive board in washington the 
state news agency pap said 
the first credit installment could be received as early as next 
week pap reported 
acceptance of the letter also launches a 1 billion fund being 
prepared by western countries to back the polish currency pap said 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki and his council of ministers 
met through the night friday reviewing the plan in which poland 
vows to choke off 900 percent inflation cut budget deficits and 
weather the unemployment and poverty that the painful economic 
reforms are likely to bring 
the plan negotiated since mazowiecki formed the east blocs 
first government led by noncommunists in september is tied to the 
most extensive economic reform legislation ever attempted in the 
region 
introduced in parliament a week ago the program would overhaul 
the centralized staterun economy and replace it with a 
marketoriented system 
the imf agreement will certify to western leaders that poland is 
making serious efforts to put its economy in order and is expected 
to release further loans from the world bank and other sources it 
is also critical to arranging the rescheduling of payments on 
polands 40 billion debt to the west 
it was signed during the night it was important to sign it as 
soon as possible because the money could come pretty soon said 
tomasz drzewosowski director of the government press office 
in addition to the 700 million standby loan the imf letter of 
intent is expected to lead to 300 million in world bank loans and 
about 3 billion in other western aid 
the 1 billion currency stabilization fund is expected to be 
ready early in 1990 
poland is working to make its zloty internally convertible with 
the hard currencies of the west a step important to attracting the 
western business investment badly needed to replace polands 
outmoded and unproductive industries 
the government has asked parliament for speedy approval of the 
economic reform legislation so it can be implemented jan 1 
deputy finance minister janusz sawicki has said that if the imf 
money were not ready by jan 1 several western countries probably 
would offer a bridge loan until the first installment arrives 
the imf one of the biggest lenders to third world counties is 
owned by 152 governments with the united states holding the 
largest number of votes 
the economic program anticipates that poles real income will 
fall 20 percent there will be a 5 percent decrease in industrial 
output and a 2 percent to 3 percent drop in the gross national 
product 
price increases of 25 to 50 percent a month during early 1990 
are expected as enterprises raise prices to survive after losing 
production subsidies that have kept charges artificially low and 
maintained unprofitable firms 
many bankruptcies are likely the government is planning the 
countrys first unemployment benefits and estimates there will be 
400000 workers displaced under the communist system unemployment 
and poverty officially did not exist and there has been no welfare 
structure

soviet officials on saturday sent medical help and 
urged warsaw pact allies to support the uprising that ousted 
nicolae ceausescu in romania they all but ruled out military 
intervention 
we have to support them from the point of view of medical help 
and maybe some other kinds of help but to bring in forces i think 
thats impermissible premier nikolai i ryzhkov said 
we mustnt repeat mistakes he told reporters at the 
congress of peoples deputies the soviet parliament not long 
ago we gave our evaluation to 1968 in czechoslovakia that was on 
dec 4 and should we repeat something like that a few days later 
ryzhkov was referring to a warsaw pact statement that condemned 
the 1968 invasion of czechoslovakia to crush the prague spring 
reforms 
the irony in this instance would be the scenario of soviet 
troops helping to oust the vestiges of a stalinist regime that of 
all the nations in the soviet bloc most resembles the rigid system 
prior to the rise of mikhail s gorbachev 
romanian tv in the hands of the opposition said the soviet 
embassy had pledged to send personnel and equipment to aid the 
uprising 
the soviet news agency tass said gorbachev told parliament the 
kremlin had decided to appeal to the governments of the warsaw 
pact states with the aim of coordinated efforts in providing 
support to the people of romania 
the soviet red cross ministry of health and other organizations 
were working with similar organizations in france and eastern 
europe to provide medicine and specialists he said 
the first planes with medicines and urgent supplies have 
already arrived in bucharest tass quoted gorbachev as saying 
but they still are being held up in the bucharest airport which 
is blockaded 
gorbachev said a number of other measures were being worked 
out with warsaw pact allies and that a special working group was 
monitoring events in romania he provided no other details 
tass issued a government declaration that said the soviet 
union is ready to render rapid and effective humanitarian aid to 
the romanian people and the new leadership of the country to 
liquidate the consequences of the tragic events of recent days 
another tass dispatch said some of the wounded were likely to be 
evacuated to moldavia a soviet republic bordering romania 
moldavians are ethnically very close to romanians and speak an 
almost identical language their region belonged to romania before 
world war ii 
tass said a building housing families of the soviet trade 
delegation in bucharest was in the line of fire between pro and 
anticeausescu forces and that fires had started in the building 
tass was told by the soviet embassy in romania that the 
property of many soviet institutions in romania has been 
considerably damaged and that there are wounded among their staff 
members it said it gave no details 
the lives of soviet people including women and children are 
in serious danger tass said 
the soviet union cannot remain indifferent to the fate of 
soviet citizens and demands that those who have unleashed the above 
actions endangering the lives of soviet people should immediately 
stop them it said 
official radio moscow said soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze met with us ambassador jack f matlock and told him 
the soviet union regarded the events in romania as an expression 
of will by the romanian people seeking to renew society through 
democracy 
soviet media have pounced on the uprising in romania providing 
readers and listeners with startling detail of the battle 
ceausescu resisted the kind of reforms the soviets encouraged in 
eastern europe 
romania remained part of the soviet bloc but relations between 
gorbachev and ceausescu were notably cool they last met early in 
december in moscow when tass described their meeting in terms that 
left little doubt of sharp disagreement

fourweek movie pornathon that prompted a police investigation 
and a lawsuit 
to the embarrassment of the womens association a fourstory 
downtown building it owns was used as a set for films such as 
wanda does transylvania and wives of the rich and famous 
this has been a very unpleasant unhappy situation said 
ethel sanfordsmith associate director of the ywca in los angeles 
the ywcas stately clark residence built in 1913 previously 
had been used to shoot the tv miniseries winds of war and 
eleanor and franklin the white house years

familyoriented documentary featuring miss taylor ms 
sanfordsmith said but payment was stopped on a second check after 
the shooting was completed she said 
john laolagi owner of the defunct stallion productions in north 
hollywood said four film crews working simultaneously in a 
monthlong pornathon shot 47 adult videos he said there was 
no intent to defraud anyone 
the filming was legal city police detective greg jones said

leftist guerrillas from the nations 
largest insurgent group ambushed an army patrol in southern 
colombia on saturday killing 10 soldiers an army communique said 
the attack came just hours after another leftist guerrilla 
group the april 19 movement announced it had suspended a 
tentative peace pact after congress failed to approved key parts of 
the accord 
guerrillas belonging to the revolutionary armed forces of 
colombia blew up part of the road south of the town of san martin 
as an army patrol traveling in three vehicles passed over it the 
communique said 
the insurgents then opened fire on the patrol with automatic 
weapons and rockets killing 10 soldiers and injuring an 
undetermined number said the communique read in a radio broadcast 
by the caracol network 
the communique added that forces from the armys 7th brigade 
were still fighting the guerrillas who perpetrated the attack san 
martin is 65 miles south of bogota in meta state 
founded about 30 years ago the revolutionary armed forces of 
colombia with its estimated 5000 armed rebels is the oldest and 
largest of colombias six main guerrilla groups 
another group the april 19 movment said saturday that it would 
not lay down its weapons and accept a government amnesty this month 
as originally planned 
the movement cited as the reason for its decision congresss 
failure to approve key points of an official peace plan which were 
included in legislation to reform the countrys constitution 
the senate shelved the legislation dec 14 after the house 
attached a bill allowing a national vote on colombias extradition 
of drug traffickers 
the senate apparently accepted president virgilio barcos 
argument that the extradition referendum would lead to increased 
terrorist violence by traffickers trying to pressure the public 
into rejecting extradition 
the shelving of the reform legislation was viewed as a victory 
for the barco administrations struggle against traffickers but a 
blow to its efforts to make peace with the april 19 movement and 
other leftist groups 
the legislation would have created a special electoral system 
allowing the movement to elect members to congress with fewer votes 
than normally required the group had demanded the concession in 
return for its agreement to lay down its arms 
a joint communique issued saturday by the april 19 movements 
leaders and government negotiators said the agreement has been 
suspended but not discarded its contents are still valid and 
its negotiators have the responsibility to make it a reality the 
communique said 
both sides expressed the will to continue seeking dialogue and 
negotiation a new round of talks to save the pact is to begin in 
january

washington immigration reform has freed more than 3 million 
american residents from the label illegal alien but hispanic 
activists say reform also has helped create a huge underclass ripe 
for discrimination and exploitation by unscrupulous employers 
the immigration reform and control act of late 1986 was supposed 
to allow illegal aliens to enter the mainstream of american life 
while also stemming the rising tide of illegal immigration across 
the nations southern border 
critics say the landmark legislation has only partially 
succeeded in slowing the influx of aliens and has done little to 
improve the lives of many alreading living here 
congress and the administration these critics say also have 
turned their backs on a host of new problems 
the 80s was a period of great promise that was never met a 
great promise that failed said dan stein executive director of 
the federation for american immigration reform americans looked 
down the barrel of huge increases in immigration and failed to take 
the steps needed to fix the system 
hispanic rights organizations said the legislation which bars 
employers from hiring undocumented aliens has created an 
underclass of people desperate for jobs but vulnerable to employers 
who pay subminimum wages and require workers to perform hazardous 
tasks 
at the same time significant numbers of employers wary about 
sanctions for breaking the new law are discriminating against 
foreignborn or foreignsounding job applicants the activists 
claim 
and congress and the administration have yet to make good on 
their promise to increase the ranks of the border patrol by 50 
percent before the bills enactment there were 3700 border patrol 
agents today there are 3800 on duty according to the immigration 
and naturalization service 
the border patrol also has been thrown into the war on drugs and 
other missions that divert its attention from patrolling the 
border said rep bruce morrison dconn chairman of the house 
judiciary subcommittee on immigration refugees and international 
law 
it was overall an enforcement failure stein said the 
ins and the border patrol have known what needs to be done yet the 
administration has never put pressure on congress to give us a 
respectable level of border funding 
the reforms however appear to have succeeded at least 
initially in slowing the number of aliens crossing the southwest 
border illegally 
apprehensions of these illegal aliens considered the best 
indicator of illegal immigration fell from 16 million in the 
year before the bills passage to 854939 in fiscal 1989 
apprehensions however have begun creeping up again officials say 
the bill also has succeeded in touching the lives of 31 million 
people who were in the country illegally prior to its passage but 
who are now eligible to become citizens through its amnesty 
provisions 
one in every 100 residents of the country has been 
touched said michael fix a senior research associate at the 
urban institute a washington think tank the scale is stunning 
and the kind of money spent and the impact on society over the long 
run is just stunning this is a onetime program of the size of the 
war on poverty a big social deal and i dont think the dimensions 
are really appreciated 
but activists say the amnesty provisions split families with 
one spouse allowed to remain here legally and another unqualified 
to apply for residency immigration reformers complain that 
congress failed to prepare for the clamor of relatives who surely 
will follow 
the failure to reform legal immigration which favors 
legalization of family members of new residents will mean 
unprecedented political pressure to admit millions more immigrants 
when theres not general public support for it stein said 
but mario moreno director of the washington office of the 
mexican american legal defense and educational fund said congress 
could have helped far more people achieve residency through more 
liberal amnesty standards 
at the same time those who dont qualify are outside the loop 
of any sort of safety net he said there have been reports of 
people being taken advantage of of being exploited 
some have taken such hazardous jobs as improperly managed 
asbestos removal or working with toxic wastes moreno said 
jose garcia de lara national president of the league of united 
latin american citizens said he has heard of illegal aliens doing 
hazardous construction or agricultural work or being forced into 
crime 
theyre certainly an unprotected people he said and as 
long as there is political and economic turmoil to the south of the 
rio grande mexicans central and south americans will continue to 
try to enter the country illegally 
congress passed the bill and turned its back de lara said 
congress should roll up its sleeves and do a major overhaul of 
irca and include an initiative to help the countries south of our 
border 
added moreno the unabated flow of aliens is not going to be 
stopped by employer sanctions 
activists complain those sanctions however are responsible for 
employer discrimination against foreignlooking and 
foreignsounding job seekers 
its a very real powerful problem said fix while it may 
be irca related its not just an irca problem a lot of 
discrimination predated irca 
de lara said the office of special counsel within the justice 
department has done almost nil to enforce the laws 
antidiscrimination provisions 
rep john bryant dtexas a member of the immigration 
subcommittee agreed the administration has refused to take 
seriously the obligation to enforce the antidiscrimination 
provisions in the bill they dont have the people to enforce it 
but rep lamar smith of texas the ranking republican on the 
immigration panel said hes seen little evidence of discrimination 
there have only been a dozen or so proven cases of 
discrimination because of employer sanctions and this despite the 
fact that a number of organizations have spent a lot of time trying 
to come up with examples of discrimination said smith 
ins spokesman verne jervis also said discrimination does not 
appear to be severe 
enforcement of employer sanctions however has fallen short in 
smiths view 
until we vigorously enforce employer sanctions we are not 
going to significantly stem the flood of illegal aliens entering 
the united states im hoping we will see more enforcement and the 
imposition of more penalties in the future smith said

two weeks ago hundreds of people 
gathered around a large tv to watch their neighborhood hero 
roberto duran fight american boxer sugar ray leonard and make the 
kind of money they cannot even dream of 
last week they watched another fight on the streets of el 
chorrillo as the invading americans attacked gen manuel antonio 
noriegas headquarters nearby many were killed or wounded 
thousands lost their homes 
on dec 7 they sat on the ground to watch the match on a large 
screen set up on a flatbed truck provided by gustavo torreclosa el 
chorrillos representative to noriegas rump national legislature 
stonehands duran lost but the people of el chorrillo were 
philosophical about it leonard dominated the fight but their el 
chorrilloborn hero had held several world championships hed had 
his day 
el chorrillo had 28000 residents mostly black and poor every 
friday night was an outdoor party of music and dancing with fresh 
fried fish and beer sold on the sidewalk the beer was cheap it 
usually fell off a truck down at the balboa docks 
petty crime was a danger and there were plenty of 
maleantes or hoods and those who tried to act like hoods 
the barrio was right next to noriegas headquarters wednesday 
morning us cannon fire and swept across the neighborhood for 
hours as troops moved in to try to capture the general 
the general is gone but so is el chorrillo 
the wooden structures dating back to the late 1800s and early 
1900s burned like tinder under the shattering cannonade the fire 
lit the sky through the night and sent a pall of smoke across the 
city throughout the next day 
buildings that were home to thousands were reduced to a frieze 
of charred sticks 
hundreds were wounded and more than a hundred were dead 
according to doctors at santo tomas hospital a mile down the 
shore torreclosa was among the first victims everyone who was not 
wounded or killed left many were dazed many were unable to take 
out even a single possession 
we tried to avoid civilian casualties said a us soldier 
who had been there the night of the attack he refused to give his 
name 
on saturday the area was still off limits us tanks and 
soldiers patrolled the streets with loudspeakers warning everyone 
to stay away 
why did they do this a resident asked looking at the 
rubble that had been his building 200 yards away just because 
they wanted to get noriega

after an allnight vigil in the pentagon war 
room as last weeks panama invasion began defense secretary dick 
cheney and gen colin powell emerged at 745 am to explain the 
stillunfolding operation 
standing before a packed room of reporters and cameras cheney 
laid out the reasoning behind president bushs decision and then 
stood aside to watch the youngestever chairman of the joint chiefs 
of staff provide a halfhour detailed breakdown of the most 
massive military operation since the vietnam war 
speaking at length without notes about the complex influx of 
soldiers and their varied missions powell made sure to offer the 
cameras a sound bite colorfully pronouncing gen manuel 
antonio noriegas supporters thugs and rabble rousers and 
declaring this reign of terror is over 
even though the deposed dictator had eluded his military 
opponents the 52yearold powell vowed we will chase him and we 
will find him 
its been some years since mr noriega has been living in 
the jungle im not quite sure hes up to being chased around 
the countryside by army rangers special forces and light infantry 
units the fourstar general said 
powell the first black to hold the post as the nations highest 
military officer had shied away from media attention during his 
first four months as the new chairman of the joint chiefs telling 
his associates i need to get to know my job 
then at bushs order he organized the shipment of 26000 troops 
into panama and the spotlight couldnt have been more intense 
by all accounts powell has won the applause of his pentagon 
colleagues 
the praise has been so constant in fact that when a senior 
pentagon official was asked to say something negative about the 
fourstar general the civilian jokingly replied hes army 
powell has appeared a bit weary and puffyfaced in recent days 
as he has met with reporters usually with cheney at his side to 
explain the military action that toppled noriega from power 
pentagon spokesman pete williams who has sat in on many of 
cheneys meetings with powell says the general has a good public 
relations sense powell honed those skills as the top military 
aide to onetime pentagon chief caspar weinberger and during his 
white house years as the deputy national security adviser to frank 
carlucci whose post he later held 
the chairman has been good about letting his staff speak 
williams said pointing to the neardaily briefings held by lt 
gen tom kelly the director of operations for the joint chiefs and 
rear adm ted sheafer the jcs chief of intelligence 
but williams said that when the general makes a decision 
thats it hes unequivocal 
he doesnt let things get out of hand williams said 
adding i dont think ive ever heard him yell let alone raise 
his voice 
powell is regarded among his fellows as thoughtful and precise 
as well as an officer who shows little favoritism toward his own 
branch of service the army 
colin not only is smart he thinks smart said a senior navy 
official he may be career army but he is the least biased 
toward his own service than anybody i know 
powell was born in new york city the son of jamaican 
immigrants he distinguished himself as the best infantry 
instructor at fort benning ga in the mid1960s and won a bronze 
star and purple heart in vietnam 
he became a white house fellow and later became weinbergers 
senior military assistant 
powell was chosen for the nations highest military post by bush 
this fall shortly after he had been put in charge of forces 
command at fort mcpherson ga overseeing the nations 1 million 
usbased troops 
the president impressed with powell during their frequent white 
house contacts picked powell over many other military men with 
broader military experience and advanced age 
the chairman played a major role in urging bush and the joint 
chiefs to adopt the maximum military option for dealing with the 
panamanian situation one longtime pentagon official said 
he really has switched roles the powell acquaintance said 
noting that powell in his national security council days was loathe 
to take up state department demands for more military involvement 
in central america 
the breakpoint in the administrations approach to noriega came 
after the shooting of an unarmed marine last saturday and powell 
began preparing to offer the president a range of military options 
shortly thereafter one of the senior pentagon officials said 
he was in on it from the very first the official said

mobs also massed in the streets of bucharest 
20 years ago but unlike the determined throngs now dismantling 
romanian president nicolae ceausescus dictatorship the crowds of 
1969 were dancing in praise of ceausescu and his american 
visitor president richard nixon 
at one point ceausescu and i were literally swept up by the 
dancing in the streets nixon recalled in his memoirs 
soon after his first inauguration nixon undertook a politically 
daring visit to bucharest he became the first us president to 
visit a soviet satellite capital hoping to needle the soviets 
former secretary of state henry a kissinger recalled in his 
autobiographical white house years 
early in his quartercentury reign ceausescu attracted the 
attention of us strategists with his effort to pursue a foreign 
policy independent from moscow 
he kept romania in the warsaw pact and ran a typically tough 
domestic regime but unlike other warsaw pact members he did not 
break relations with israel after the 1967 mideast war he pursued 
a strong relationship with china and he criticized the pacts 1968 
invasion of czechoslovakia 
both nixon and kissinger said later that ceausescu helped 
provide a channel for diplomatic communications to chinese leaders 
before the united states had official relations with the mainland 
ceausescu kindled nixons interest when the future president 
visited bucharest as a private tourist in 1967 expecting a routine 
reception nixon recalled in his memoirs that ceausescu surprised 
him with a grand welcome and everywhere we were greeted with 
outbursts of friendship from the people 
nixon wrote that he told ceausescu of his desire to normalize 
us relations with mainland china planting the seeds of what 
nixon later called the romanian channel in approaches to 
beijing and north vietnam 
after his 1969 inauguration nixon included romania on his 
roundtheworld trip and recalled in his memoirs when we landed 
in bucharest aug 2 i became the first american president to make 
a state visit to a communist satellite country 
president nicolae ceausescu is a strong independent leader 
who had cultivated good relations with the chinese in spite of the 
fact that he had to walk a very fine line lest the soviets decide 
to intervene in romania as they had in hungary in 1956 and in 
czechoslovakia in 1968 so far he had walked that line with 
consummate skill 
nixon said ceausescu also agreed to do everything possible to 
help us negotiations with hanoi to bring peace to indochina 
nixon brought ceausescu to washington for a state visit in 
october 1970 and said in his memoirs that the visit marked the 
start of the romanian channel to beijing 
nixon recalled that the romanian channel was used in 1971 when 
ceausescus washington ambassador conveyed a message from premier 
chou enlai saying in view of the fact i had visited bucharest in 
1969 and belgrade in 1970 i would be welcome in peking nixon 
made his historic first visit to china in 1972 after two 
exploratory missions by kissinger 
kissinger wrote that nixon visited bucharest in 1969 to repay 
ceausescus courtesies of 1967 but his principal reason was to 
needle the soviets 
nixon used ceausescus 1970 washington visit for a public step 
forward in the feelers to china kissinger said in a white house 
toast to ceausescu nixon toasted the many common interests of 
the united states and romania listing prominently that of good 
relations such as romania had with the united states the soviet 
union and the peoples republic of china it was the first use of 
chinas official name by an american president kissinger said

iranian newspapers on saturday criticized 
last weeks official visit of romanian leader nicolae ceausescu 
who was later ousted in a popular revolution 
the daily ettelaat said the visit provided an opportunity for 
international news media to defame iran the islamic republic news 
agency reported 
the foreign ministry would do well to offer some explanation 
why it arranged for ceausescu to visit tehran at an inopportune 
time when his ouster was not something difficult to guess it 
said 
the englishlanguage tehran times joined in the criticism by 
writing the nagging question is why should he be received in our 
capital while a whole nation has risen up against his rule 
how can the iranian nation which made one of the most 
vigorous revolutions against an armedtotheteeth dictator not 
share the sentiment of the romanian people standing up to an 
autocratic rule it added the romanian nations victory is a 
triumph of all nations 
the newspapers editorial to be published in sundays issue 
was quoted in advance by irna 
the staff of the romanian embassy in tehran on saturday declared 
its support for the uprising in bucharest and for the new national 
salvation committee the news agency quoted ambassador ilie sisu as 
saying 
during his visit to iran that ended wednesday ceausescu signed 
a deal under which iran would export 41 million barrels of oil and 
1 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year to romania 
ceausescu 71 also visited the tomb of the late ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini in a nearobligatory stop for foreign dignitaries 
the times of london reported saturday that iranian leaders had 
difficulty persuading ceausescu to visit the tomb at the behesht 
zahra cemetery outside tehran 
ettelaat criticized the large number of ceausescu relatives he 
installed in high places in the romanian government it also 
blasted his role in facilitating contacts between former egyptian 
and israeli leaders anwar sadat and menachem begin 
let us hope ceausescu was the last falling star to come to the 
islamic republic for his last meal the newspaper wrote 
let us respect the will of the people of romania the 
inopportune visit to tehran by ceausescu may be made good by 
saluting the struggle of the romanian people 
the daily generally considered progovernment and supportive of 
the private sector said an iranian student was among the hundreds 
of demonstrators killed in the western romanian city of timisoara 
while ceausescu was in tehran 
romania is irans secondbiggest trading partner in eastern 
europe with the volume of trade estimated at about 18 billion 
the new agreements if they remain in place would boost that to 3 
billion a year

other hardline communist leaders did to establish and cement 
authority he brought his own followers into the partys top 
echelons

state hierarchy

defense minister another brother nicolae andruta was a police

planning among other brothers marin was a diplomat and florea an 
editor with the communist party newspaper scinteia 
ceausescus brotherinlaw vasile barbulescu was a party 
secretary in charge of agriculture and gheorghe petrescu elenas 
brother was in charge of the trade unions 
ceausescus youngest son nicu 39 was reportedly a womanizer 
and a heavy drinker reputed for his passion for western sports 
cars and hunting parties he was linked romantically at one time to 
romanian gymnastics star nadia comaneci who defected to the united 
states on nov 28 
nicu nicknamed the crown prince was party secretary in the 
sibiu county in southern transylvania home to a powerful military 
and security garrison

council the romanian equivalent of the boy scouts and girl scouts 
one of ceausescus other sons valentin was a leading nuclear 
researcher and his daughter zoia elena led the institute of 
mathematics in romanias capital

positions in security trade and agriculture

at an age when many people are slowing 
down to enjoy their golden years 70yearold ellen ahlgren is busy 
heading an international drive to help babies afflicted with aids 
ahlgren runs an organization called abc quilts aids baby crib 
quilts whose members make and distribute small quilts to babies 
with acquired immune deficiency syndrome so far theyve made 
nearly 1300 
when you cant do anything its depressing she said 
when you can its a very good feeling 
in 18 months abc quilts has grown from a contingent known as 
ellens elves who worked out of her living room to a network 
of hundreds of quilters in 44 states and several countries 
including japan australia and england the project is supported 
solely through donations 
the quilters use original patterns and designs and each quilt 
has a patch that reads love and comfort to you and has the name 
and city of its maker 
most are sent to ahlgrens home which has become a sort of 
command center with maps tables and papers not to mention 
quilts cluttering the living room waiting for distribution 
every day is like christmas here ahlgren said in a recent 
interview theres always boxes being opened 
ahlgren contacts hospitals across the country to see where 
quilts are wanted and sends them off to places like new york city 
chicago philadelphia houston and washington dc 
those cities are a far cry from ahlgrens rural home located 
about 60 miles north of boston in a town with 2400 residents from 
her kitchen is a view of a snowy field and thick woods 
its a much different setting from the impoverished and 
depressing surroundings where many of the aids babies live 
a babys a baby no matter where theyre sick she said 
though she realizes the babies she is helping probably wont 
live long it doesnt discourage her 
this project taps into a tremendous energy of love 
compassion generosity it raises the awareness of people and helps 
them learn about this horrible epidemic its not just 
statistics 
ahlgren a mental health counselor who worked at a hospice 
before retiring launched the quilt project after reading an 
article about aids babies 
i had made about 20 quilts for my own family and had seen how 
much they enjoyed them so i put two and two together said 
ahlgren who has five children and nine grandchildren 
ahlgren said she and some of her relatives and quilting friends 
made fliers outlining the project and asking for help they posted 
them in various towns in new hampshire and massachusetts then an 
article about the fledgling group appeared in a national quilting 
magazine 
i had been on vacation and when i returned there were 360 
letters waiting for me she said 
since then nearly 1300 quilts have been made and distributed 
ahlgrens goal is to pass out 10000 by 1991 a number that would 
equal the projected number of aids babies 
ahlgren likes to tell a story about a 2yearold aids baby from 
philadelphia nurses said all the infant did for most of the day 
was cry until they gave him an abc quilt 
he reached out and hugged it and went to sleep ahlgren 
said smiling

the redbrick rowhouse is still standing where 
little virginia ohanlon lived where she penned the letter nearly 
a century ago that implored a newspaper editor to tell her the 
truth does santa claus exist 
but no one lives at 115 w 95th st anymore and santa claus 
would find no stockings hung by the chimney with care he would 
find boardedup windows a gutted interior and a flock of pigeons 
in a neighborhood that has had hard times only to rebound into 
affluence in a city that cries out for housing the vacancy of 
virginia ohanlons fourstory house and five others on the street 
has caused controversy 
virginia is all but forgotten in the dispute 
but at least one person remembers last christmas someone 
pinned an unsigned christmas card on the door along with a 
clipping from a newspaper that reprinted virginias letter and the 
response 
please tell me the truth is there a santa claus virginia 
wrote she was 8 years old and some of her classmates were 
skeptics 
in an editorial published on sept 21 1897 in the new york 
sun francis pharcellus church replied yes virginia there is a 
santa claus 
he exists as certainly as love and generosity and devotion 
exist church said how dreary would be the world if there 
were no santa claus it would be as dreary as if there were no 
virginias 
virginia ohanlon douglas died on may 13 1971 a decade 
earlier she had reaffirmed her belief in the santa claus spirit 
saying it stands for love and sharing the joy of giving and the 
extension of it to all people 
but at the time of her death her childhood home already had 
been vacant for about five years recalls jeanne l beatty 
president of the west 95th street development corp which holds 
the houses title 
and now santa himself probably couldnt find virginias house 
the street numbers are missing chicken wire blocks the entrance 
someone has scrawled aids housing now in red on the door 
not long ago a human body was drawn on the sidewalk out front 
with the caption homeless people are freezing to death and this 
building stands vacant 
the nonprofit west 95th corporation developed five houses on 
the street and was supposed to arrange the refurbishing and 
development of six others including virginias home which was to 
hold five families 
but the corporation instead became involved in a legal snarl in 
which the city and neighbors are trying to get back the houses 
claiming ms beatty is holding the property until prices rise she 
says the legal battle has prevented her from refurbishing the 
buildings 
the fight has dragged on for more than a decade 
for the last 10 years the corporation has acted in a totally 
illegal manner by having no board of directors no bylaws no 
annual meetings or any other kind of control beyond the onewoman 
control of jeanne beatty lawyer and neighbor lawrence j gross 
charged in a letter to the state attorney generals office 
he estimated the six buildings once worth about 20000 apiece 
could now bring several million dollars 
but ms beatty says shes no scrooge 
my money is sitting there and has been carrying all of this 
im the one whos been going through all the stress it has impeded 
my health and career its been bleeding me frankly the money id 
been making in real estate is gone she said 
ms beatty said the buildings must be totally refurbished except 
for walls and ceilings 
much has changed since virginia wrote her letter but ms beatty 
insisted the christmas spirit lives on west 95th street 
its in mourning really she said perhaps i should put a 
wreath on the door this year we hope in 1990 it will be occupied 
and lights on again in the window and laughter and cheer for the 
next holiday and carolers can stop by

a special prosecutor said he was up 
against deeply instilled ideas about what is murder when he failed 
to persuade a jury that the man who caused a bus crash that killed 
27 people deserved life in prison 
larry mahoney a 36yearold chemical plant worker was 
convicted thursday of manslaughter assault wanton endangerment 
and drunken driving his jury recommended a 16year prison sentence 
the verdict came 19 months after mahoney driving drunk and on 
the wrong side of interstate 71 ran his pickup into the front of a 
church bus loaded with youngsters on a church outing 
the impact knocked off the bus front axle the gas tank was 
punctured and a fuel fire exploded into the bus interior killing 
24 children and three adults forty people escaped but 12 children 
suffered disfiguring burns 
kentucky authorities have been empowered to charge drunken 
drivers with murder since the late 1970s but convictions are rare 
requiring a jury to find that a defendant acted wantonly with 
extreme indifference to human life 
in the mahoney case the murder charge didnt stick even though 
the tragedy was compounded by the innocence of the victims and the 
horrible way they died 
prosecutors must overcome a deepseated inbred public 
perception of what is murder said assistant attorney general 
paul richwalsky who prosecuted mahoney 
maybe if this crime was called anything else vehicular 
homicide or somehow the label murder was not attached to it 
the results may have been different he said 
though it would have been of great symbolic significance a 
murder conviction probably would have had little real effect on 
mahoneys sentence richwalsky said 
mahoneys most serious conviction was for firstdegree assault 
punishable by 10 to 20 years in prison the jury recommended a 
dozen 16year sentences and the maximum 10 years on each of 27 
counts of seconddegree manslaughter but it also ordered all the 
sentences to run concurrently 
the assault conviction made mahoney a violent offender under 
kentucky law meaning he must serve half his sentence eight years 
before he can be considered for parole 
a murder conviction with a minimum 20year sentence would have 
made mahoney eligible for parole in 10 years 
the jurys decisions nevertheless outraged relatives of many of 
the crash victims who said they had been denied even a hollow 
victory 
janet kytta had wanted just the word murder from the jury 
it was not manslaughter it was murder she said 
her husband chuck kytta was youth director for the church 
radcliff first assembly of god and had arranged the youngsters 
outing to an amusement park 
kytta was standing at the bus front door and must have been 
killed by fire before he could have passed out from smoke dr 
george nichols the states chief medical examiner testified

mikhail gorbachev whose political and economic 
reforms in the soviet union sparked a revolution that shattered 
communist control of eastern europe was named man of the decade by 
time magazine saturday 
the soviet president previously named times man of the year in 
1987 was chosen because he is the force behind the most 
momentous events of the 80s and because what he has already done 
will almost certainly shape the future time said 
the only precedent for such a choice by the magazine was its 
selection of winston churchill as man of the halfcentury in 1949 
this year as world attention ricocheted from the stirrings of 
democracy in the ussr to the massacre in beijing and the 
peaceful revolts in eastern europe it became clear that we were 
witnessing a sequence of events that began well before 1989 and 
whose impact would extend into the next decade perhaps the next 
century the magazine said 
somehow confining our choice to 1989 seemed inadequate and 
thus we named gorbachev man of the decade 
the magazine said he has accelerated history making possible 
the end of one of its most disreputable episodes the imposition of 
a cruel and unnatural order on hundreds of millions of people 
gorbachev becomes only the fourth nonamerican designated twice 
by the magazine one was churchill 1940 and 1949 the others were 
soviet leader josef stalin 1939 and 1942 and chinas deng 
xiaoping 1978 and 1985 
time has been naming a man of the year since 1927 choosing the 
person who for better or worse has had the most impact on the 
years events the first award went to aviator charles lindbergh 
last years winner was earth as planet of the year

a group of panamanian prisoners 
including a military officer involved in the illfated coup in 
october took over an island penitentiary and asked for help from 
the united states us military officials said saturday 
the prison which had been run by loyalists to gen manuel 
antonio noriega is on an island off panamas pacific coast about 
60 miles from the capital 
us officials said the prisoner revolt was led by a man 
identified only as major pajaro who was said to be one of the 
leaders of the unsuccessful coup against noriega on oct 3 
no other details of the prison revolt were available 
meanwhile us military officials said small bands of noriega 
supporters were continuing harassing attacks in the capital 
lt col jerry marguila spokesman for the us southern 
command said the hitandrun noriega loyalists are increasing 
their activities of harassing attacks with small arms and mortar 
fire threatening the civilian population and hostagetaking 
when pressed for specific numbers marguila replied i dont 
have in my mind an increase in numbers between today and yesterday 
of dignitybattalion efforts its just that they are becoming more 
of a concern because they are taking more of our time as opposed 
to the pdf panama defense force 
marguila said the task of the us troops is turning from 
conventional warfare to counterterrorism and police duties 
the us military spokesman said armed bandits continue to 
roam many parts of panama city and that looting has moved from 
shopping districts into some upperclass residential neighborhoods 
where residents have been arming themselves 
marguila said that with the neutralizing of the pdf by the us 
military the country is without an adequate police force to deal 
with the lawlessness 
the pdf was involved in just about every nook and cranny of 
the government since that element is gone there is a void and a 
gap especially in the police force and that is something we 
need to rebuild the spokesman said

the christmas weekend cold snap has stretched 
the nations energy system to the maximum and created spot 
shortages of heating fuels in some areas the energy departments 
chief of emergency preparedness said saturday 
at the moment we think we can get through this abnormally cold 
weather without widespread energy shortages but the outlook 
could darken if refineries break down or other unforeseen problems 
develop said john j easton jr 
easton the assistant energy secretary for international affairs 
and energy emergencies said the government was not considering 
imposing any price or allocation controls 
easton spoke to reporters at energy department headquarters 
during a break in a daylong meeting with about 80 representatives 
of oil companies electric utilities natural gas distributors 
state energy offices and other federal departments 
the meeting was called thursday to exchange information about 
localized distribution problems and to consider easing federal 
rules affecting energy transportation easton said for example 
that the department of transportation was waiving certain limits on 
working hours by fuel truck drivers 
the energy department has begun processing applications for 
waivers of the jones act which prohibits the use of foreign ships 
to carry us oil products in domestic waters easton said adding 
that some exceptions could be granted so that foreign ships heading 
overseas with us fuel products could reverse course to us ports 
easton said the main problem in heating fuels as of saturday 
afternoon was distribution of propane 
in propane there are spot shortages and it will be tight for 
the next 10 days or so he said later he said these shortages 
were in many parts of the country mainly the northeast and 
midwest 
easton said the department wanted to reassure the public that 
the federal government is concerned about the hardships posed 
by heating fuel shortages and that it is actively trying to cut 
the red tape to relieve the bottlenecks 
this is not an emergency easton said stressing that 
supplies of heating oil and natural gas as of saturday were 
adequate although refineries were operating at maximum capacity to 
meet unprecedented demand for heating fuels 
we do not expect any shortages in natural gas although i can 
say the system is producing at the maximum at the present time 
easton said he said some parts of texas were experiencing 
rotating blackouts due to electricity shortages but that power 
supplies in most areas were generally adequate 
easton said the meeting was told by a national weather service 
official that extreme cold weather was expected to continue at 
least through the end of december in the northeast but that some 
relief was likely soon for other regions the january outlook was 
for abnormal cold in the north central states but less harsh 
conditions elsewhere he said

panamas new president said saturday 
he had only three hours warning of the us attack that toppled 
gen manuel antonio noriega and has been scrambling ever since 
because his government had to start from point zero 
president guillermo endara said in an interview that the news of 
the us invasion at midnight tuesday was like a kick in the 
head it was not the best thing i would have thought 
we were not really consulted said endara who said he was 
very diplomatically told of president bushs plans only two or 
three hours before it was launched 
endara said saturday he had named a cabinet but was not making 
the names public yet to protect its members one of endaras vice 
presidents ricardo arias calderon survived an assassination 
attempt friday 
we are keeping them confidential but they will be announced 
soon endara told a group of reporters 
endara and his two vice presidents were sworn in one day after 
the us invasion they assumed office friday 
a few hours later fighters loyal to noriega raked arias car 
wounding two of his bodyguards 
it is a shaky government i took over a government of a 
country invaded by another country there was total anarchy this 
is the first time a government has to start from point zero but we 
are working hard endara said 
endara said he was trying to get one of panama citys two 
airports open to allow food and medicine to be flown in 
endara said his government is also trying to organize a police 
force to replace the one that fell apart with noriegas downfall 
setting off a massive looting spree 
we swore in the first 20 members of the force yesterday 
he added the new force will be commanded by col roberto armijo a 
former noriega loyalist who switched sides 
asked how he felt about the american invasion endara replied 
i have lots of work to do i have no time to think about the bad 
things noriega destroyed everything when he fell everything was 
back to zero 
i would have been happier without an intervention i could 
have gone into a depression over the invasion he said 
i probably would have worked out some details in advance like 
the matter of public order he added 
but he said he could work with the americans 
the gringos have their defects but i am used to them i 
wish it would have been different but we have to work with what we 
have endara said 
he denied reports that he was sworn in before a judge at a us 
military base 
i was sworn in on panamanian territory in a panamanian home 
after 1 am then in the morning we went to the us military base 
at fort clayton he said 
endara and vice presidential candidates arias and guillermo ford 
were elected by a landslide in may 7 elections according to us 
and other foreign observers noriega declared the election void 
all three were scheduled to have been sworn in sept 1 but 
instead noriega named a provisional president and ended up having 
himself elevated to chief of government before the us attack 
everybody would be more at ease if noriega were in custody 
but noriega is not essential now he is out of power forever he is 
not so popular among the people endara said 
he never was people are sad because of the price they had to 
pay for all this he added

this christmas is the first in 15 years 
that belva kent has been at peace the irony does not escape her 
that it was serial killer ted bundy who made the respite possible 
just before his jan 24 execution in florida bundy confessed to 
having killed her 17yearold daughter debra and at least 22 
other young women in the 1970s the condemned man also indicated on 
a map torn from an atlas where he dumped three of his eight victims 
in utah 
numerous searches over several months in central utah netted 
hundreds of animal bones but only a single human kneecap it was 
among 10 bags of bones collected by searchers in early may near a 
road leading into fairview canyon 150 miles south of salt lake 
city 
that was where bundy a former utah law student had said to 
look 
within days belva kent her exhusband dean and two of their 
three surviving children went with detectives to the rockstrewn 
hillside 
we were very peaceful down there belva kent said in an 
interview friday night i came home feeling better than i have in 
15 years 
it took longer for dean kent but after some weeks he concluded 
that bundy in this instance hadnt been lying 
based on what we had known from his confession his 
description fit the area im confident its a good possibility 
thats where he disposed of the remains dean kent said 
its given me peace of mind to believe thats what happened 
the state medical examiner said the kneecap was likely that of a 
young woman but there was no way to determine if it was debra 
kents 
debra kent disappeared the night of nov 8 1974 from a high 
school parking lot in bountiful 10 miles north of salt lake city 
she had left a play early to pick up her younger brother bill at 
a roller rink 
even though the kents had been certain for years that debra was 
a bundy victim his confession and execution struck them in 
surprising ways 
i had anticipated a much different feeling than i had dean 
kent said id felt some of the bitterness would be relieved but 
that isnt the case i think ill carry that to my grave 
belva kent 53 relived the grief all over again 
everyone says youre not given more than you can handle but 
ive been questioning that a bit lately she said 
after debra disappeared her brother bill blamed himself his 
bitterness toward bundy was matched only by his inability to stifle 
the pain five years ago after his marriage broke up he died at 
26 in an alcoholrelated auto accident 
within months of bills death dean kent started drinking 
walked out on a 29year marriage quit his job as an oil company 
executive and fathered a child he lives alone now trying to come 
to grips with his shattered life 
i certainly feel he was the cancer that destroyed our 
family kent said of bundy 
belva kent had raised five children and never worked outside the 
home her selfesteem departed with her husband 
but then there comes a point where you see the bitterness 
doesnt get you anywhere she said so she got a job and has been 
working since 
last summer belva kent was diagnosed as having a benign brain 
tumor behind her forehead the size of a tangerine surgery had to 
be put off when doctors found she also was suffering from multiple 
sclerosis 
then in a reaction to an antiseizure medication belva kents 
entire body blistered and peeled leaving her right eye tearless 
belva kents been back to work for three weeks now slowly 
regaining strength for the brain surgery she will have in late 
spring 
i guess its not my nature to feel sorry for myself she 
says besides other people suffer too its just that my 
hardships are more obvious 
after debra disappeared the kents kept the front porch light 
burning day and night its kept on now belva says as a memorial

justice was swift in a kangaroo court 
on the streets of panama city on saturday time elapsed from arrest 
to trial to release 30 minutes 
the streets of the beleaguered capital had calmed somewhat by 
saturday four days after the us invasion unleashed a frenzy of 
looting 
there was little left to take by the weekend and the level of 
gunfire had dimmed to sporadic exchanges in most of the city 
the balance appeared to have tilted in many areas in favor of 
the armed citizen patrols barricading their neighborhoods with 
everything from exercise bikes and toilet bowls to overturned 
trucks and concrete blocks 
where are the gringos where are the mps where are the 
police demanded a man helping guard a supermarket where steel 
bars staved off looters 
we know this invasion was necessary he said but panama 
has been looted because they are not around they have not made any 
effort to protect decent citizens 
he and his neighbors armed with everything from pistols to 
doublebarreled shotguns had been guarding punta paitilla a 
middleclass area for days nerves were on edge 
they were letting shoppers enter the market in groups of five 
hundreds of people stood in the hot sun waiting their turn at the 
dwindling stock 
suddenly a group of vigilantes came down the street herding 
four prisoners suspected looters stopped at a barricade nearby 
the men were put face down on the pavement and searched their 
hands were tied behind their backs with shoelaces and belts as a 
crowd gathered 
the mood was ugly 
shut your mouth a grayhaired man shouted as one of the 
prisoners tried to speak 
look at the fat one another man cried hes trembling 
one of vigilantes began kicking the man in the head 
stop it people shouted rushing to pull the vigilante back 
another selfappointed cop fired his pistol into the air things 
calmed down 
i know this man one bystander said coming forward hes 
no thief 
the captors moved their prisoners to a curb sat them down and 
began to question them as others came forward to vouch for the man 
or question the vigilantes about the arrest 
a spontaneous court was in session 
the man who had been kicked showed his identity cards 
he was felix suarez a 52yearold minibus operator with a 
contract to transport employees of fort clayton one of the us 
bases near the city he also held a permit for the 32caliber 
pistol he had been packing 
this is a mistake suarez said its a bad mistake 
the vigilantes admitted the gun was what sparked their 
suspicions suarez and his companions all more poorly dressed than 
most in the crowd had not been caught in the act of looting 
were going to let them go someone declared and people in 
the crowd nodded their approval there is no proof they did 
anything wrong 
as suarez and his companions were untied a doctor who asked 
that his name not be used watched his neighbors thoughtfully 
we are trying to impose some order here he said so far 
people have not done savage things but we dont have anywhere to 
send them prisoners we dont have any police someday well have 
to say lets eliminate them

journalists itching to get to the 
hemispheres story of the year have sometimes chafed at the 
restrictions imposed on them by the us military 
if we had it to do over again we would never have allowed you 
all to come said a harried air force col ronald sconyers 
spokesman for the us southern command 
reporting has indeed been dangerous though not impossible in 
the days following the us invasion that began wednesday 
snipers panamanian defense force resisters gen manuel antonio 
noriegas dignity battalion fighters looters and various and 
sundry assailants roamed the city with us soldiers searching for 
noriega himself 
several reporters including candice hughes of the associated 
press were held hostage and threatened with death by noriega 
loyalists before they were set free 
the us embassy said saturday that pronoriega forces had 
released jon meyersohn a cbs producer seized wednesday at the 
marriott hotel and american businessman doug mullen cbs said 
mullen was an executive with gte and was taken hostage with 
meyersohn 
some journalists were not so lucky a spanish photographer was 
killed and two foreign journalists were wounded by gunfire 
before dawn friday about 300 journalists arrived here but the 
southern command kept most of them cooped up at howard air base and 
on nearby rodman naval station 
clad in a helmet and full battle gear sconyers briefed a 
hungry tired unwashed legion of reporters late friday at howard 
four miles west of panama city 
a reporters job is currently impossible on the streets of 
panama city he said 
the journalists slept on the floor and lived on hot dogs and 
popcorn while waiting for permission to leave though mindful of 
the danger in panama city most of the journalists began to chafe 
at the restrictions 
by saturday morning southern command authorities had convinced 
about a third of the journalists to return home the command then 
released the other reporters 
i can understand why they did it i dont like it but i 
understand it said one us reporter 
a handful of journalists was able to get into panama on small 
chartered planes thursday before two big charters one from miami 
and the other from neighboring costa rica arrived early friday 
it was that descent of hundreds of reporters that set off alarms 
at the southern command 
one reporter who arrived thursday marjorie miller of the los 
angeles times said it was dangerous to report from the streets 
friday and that setting loose several hundred reporters most with 
little or no experience in panama or in combat could have had 
grave consequences 
there were a lot of people with guns on the streets said 
ms miller who has worked in central america for several years 
covering war and social upheaval 
one reporter called the restrictions an attempt to 
breastfeed the media with what the southern command wanted 
reporters to hear and to keep them away from the ugly side of the 
invasion 
he said individual reporters and their organizations should be 
allowed to consider the risks and take responsibility for their 
coverage

the united states saturday to end its military action promptly 
saying the attack had trampled on panamas sovereignty and 
caused death destruction and hunger 
even though the action was aimed at bringing freedom to all 
panamanians we cannot help but lament the deep wound inflicted to 
our free and sovereign country and the enormous human and material 
damages it has caused especially among the poor said a 
communique from the nations roman catholic bishops that was read 
by archbishop marcos mcgrath 
the church asked that food and medicine be sent to the embattled 
nation following a fourday looting spree that created shortages 
after wednesdays assault on gen manuel antonio noriegas forces

regime and installing democracy the statement said

did not mention the general by name he was toppled by us troops 
and a new government installed but remains at large 
the church also asked the united states to end their military 
action as soon as possible and that the newly installed civilian 
government restore order and create a new police force to stop 
rampant looting

on our soil it said it hurts us because our nationality our

the united states britain and france 
vetoed a proposed security council resolution saturday to denounce 
the us invasion of panama and demand the immediate withdrawal of 
us troops 
we acted in panama for legitimate reasons of selfdefense and 
to protect the integrity of the canal treaties us ambassador 
thomas pickering said 
i am not here today to claim a right on behalf of the united 
states to enforce the will of history by intervening in favor of 
democracy where we are not wanted he said 
we are supporters of democracy but not the gendarme of 
democracy not in this hemisphere or anywhere else 
britain has expressed complete support in the 15member council 
for the us invasion to oust panamanian military leader manuel 
antonio noriega france has condemned both the invasion and 
noriegas dictatorship 
canada a nonpermanent council member also voted with the 
western allies 
the two communist permanent members the soviet union and china 
voted in favor of the denunciation along with algeria brazil 
colombia ethiopia malaysia nepal senegal and yugoslavia 
finland abstained on the issue 
virtually all other nations in the world body have rejected 
washingtons argument that it acted in selfdefense to protect the 
35000member us community in panama saying no nation has the 
right to invade another 
the 159nation general assembly will reconvene thursday to hear 
speeches condemning the us invasion and to adopt a resolution 
demanding an immediate troop withdrawal diplomats said 
however general assembly resolutions are only advisory unlike 
security council resolutions which can be enforced by political or 
military action 
the security council resolution introduced by the nonaligned 
movement would have demanded the immediate cessation of the 
intervention and withdrawal of the us armed forces from panama 
it would have strongly deplored the intervention in panama by 
the armed forces of the united states which constitutes a flagrant 
violation of international law and of the independence sovereignty 
and territorial integrity of states 
in october 1983 the united states vetoed a virtually identical 
resolution denouncing its invasion of the island of grenada 
the security council has not decided which of two competing 
wouldbe panamanian ambassadors represents the legitimate 
government noriegas nominee or one appointed by usinstalled 
president guillermo endara 
endara is widely believed to have been the winner in 
presidential elections may 7 but the balloting was rejected and 
nullified by noriega

saturday although one group of men was observed using a welding 
torch to cut through the security gates of a store 
buildings along the main avenue of the town were spray painted 
with antiamerican graffiti but residents said the signs predated 
the us invasion when they maintained people were forced to 
feign support for noriega 
rock said there was no resistance to the us force when it came 
back into the town saturday and that many people cheered when a 
reporter asking onlookers how much support remains for noreiga the 
crowd responded in unison nada nada meaning none

known as the dignity battalion a smiling woman wearing a dont 
worry be happy tshirt shouted in spanish indignity 
whenever someone referred to the dignity battalion 
she and others said the us troops were the first americans 
they had ever seen in their town despite the celebrating one 
woman said i wont relax until noriega is captured 
nariciso miranda a leader in the christian democratic party 
said he never thought this great day would ever come when 
noriega came to power he thought it was the end of panama he 
said 
except for the minor looting and the crowd scene outside the 
military compound life appeared near normal at la chorrera 
taxicabs were running us soldiers were keeping order at two open 
grocery stores and a gas station was operating 
but rock said the us soldiers might have to stay for a while 
there is absolutely no city government left here whatsoever

captured deposed president nicolae ceausescu on saturday and would 
put the soviet blocs last stalinist dictator on trial heavy 
fighting broke out in the capital 
the insurgents claimed control of the country after a night of 
ferocious battles between army units siding with proreform 
protesters and security forces loyal to ceausescu who fled his 
palace friday 
but loyalist guards continued to battle army units in bucharest

buildings and monuments the communist leader built to himself 
during 24 years of rule 
rocketpropelled grenades slammed into the 13story television 
building in an attempt to silence the oppositions broadcasts

shooting in bucharest had stopped and the city was virtually 
silent hungarian defense ministry spokesman gyoergy keleti said on 
hungarian television

otopeni with proceausescu forces in helicopter gunships strafing 
army units the state news agency agerpres said 
the pilot of an austrian plane that brought aid into bucharest 
friday evening said when he returned to vienna late saturday that 
he had seen at least 30 bodies of dead attackers at the airport 
the pilot who was not identified in an interview with austrian 
television said battles raged for hours at the airport with 
grenades and mortars being used 
fighting also was reported in outlying cities including 
timisoara where the revolution broke out on dec 15 however an 
associated press reporter in the city said revolutionary soldiers 
were in control 
an austrian television reporter said there was an unbelievable 
attack saturday afternoon by proceausescu forces who had 
parachuted into timisoara the day before he quoted eyewitnesses as 
seeing bodies on the street 
hundreds of people have been killed in two days of street 
fighting and thousands more were reported killed in a week of 
crackdowns on the burgeoning protest movement 
revolutionaries took swift revenge against proceausescu 
fighters captured near the downtown post office killing them on 
the spot 
romanian television gave a jubilant boost to the revolt 
announcing that the army had captured ceausescu and his wife 
elena one day after the dictator was ousted by a weekold popular 
revolt 
the dictatorial family nicolae and elena ceausescu was 
captured declared ion iliescu a member of the provisional 
revolutionary governing coalition 
ceausescu did not appear on televison however broadcasters 
said he would not be shown to prevent rescue attempts by loyalists 
the television had first reported friday that ceausescu and his 
wife were captured but withdrew that report 
iliescu called ceausescu a poison hyena and said the new 
government would prosecute the former president and his wife who 
had been the second most powerful person in the country 
emil bobu who in the past was put in control of the country 
when the ceausescus were traveling abroad also was captured with 
the ceausescus iliescu said 
on friday the revolutionaries announced they had captured 
ceausescus eldest son niku a powerful member of the ruling 
familial cabal 
in bucharest fighting continued around the television and radio 
stations and the partly damaged communist party headquarters where 
security forces barricaded themselves late friday revolutionary 
force appealed to residents nearby to evacuate 
gorbachev asked other warsaw pact nations to cooperate in 
devising coordinated efforts in providing support to the people 
of romania the tass news agency reported 
hungarian foreign minister gyula horn said said a warsaw pact 
meeting planned sunday was scrapped because the situation shows 
signs of stabilization 
soviet officials all but ruled out direct unilateral soviet 
military help but gorbachev said medical aid was being extended 
the first planes with medicines and urgent supplies have 
already arrived in bucharest tass quoted gorbachev as saying 
but they still are being held up in the bucharest airport which 
is blockaded 
doctors at bucharest emergency hospital said they had treated 
hundreds of wounded at that hospital one of 14 in the city 
dr marian palaschivescu haggard in a filthy blue terry cloth 
hospital jacket told reporters 51 bodies had arrived by early 
afternoon at bucharest emergency hospital he then glanced at three 
sets of legs protruding from the trunk of a car that screeched to a 
stop no 54 he said 
the army which rose against ceausescu on friday was joined by 
amateur revolutionaries suddenly at war after decades of 
repression their ragtag forces were nervous and often 
triggerhappy in the face of desperate professionals fighting for 
their lives against inevitable criminal prosecution under a 
reformist government 
the national salvation committee the name of the coalition 
provisional government announced that gen nicolae militaru an 
army officer demoted under ceausescu had been appointed defense 
minister 
maj gen stefan gusa former first deputy defense minister and 
gen victor stanculescu were appointed his deputies romanian

desperates who try to destroy what we have conquered they have 
failed and they will fail 
let us restore the quiet in these historic but also difficult 
moments he urged everything must go back to normal as soon as 
possible 
the national salvation committee warned against lastditch acts 
by the cornered presidential guards and the hated special police 
guards screened all people entering the intercontinental hotel 
the italian news agency ansa said the national salvation 
committee also had advised embassies in bucharest to barricade 
themselves 
chinese embassy windows had bullet holes in them and the soviet 
news agency tass said it had been told a building housing soviet 
trade representatives was in the firing line 
the diehard forces supporting ceausescu adopted guerrilla 
warfare tactics in the city holing up in hotels apartment 
buildings and on roofs and firing at soldiers and civilians on the 
streets 
despite the tension many romanians were clearly enjoying their 
sudden freedom people took wild rides around town waving huge red 
gold and blue flags from which they had ripped the center symbol of 
ceausescus brand of communism 
romanians on the street expressed happiness in tempered terms 
but choked voices and misted eyes underscored the feeling 
as gunfire smacked the television building the youth program 
editor marin constantin clowned for a dozen people pinned down 
with him 
this has finally woken us up from our sleep of death he 
said 
the state of the war shows partly why it was necessary 
romanians pointed out about the only thing in apparent abundance 
in this shortageplagued nation was ammunition 
taxis were commandeered to carry wounded and few private cars 
had enough fuel many shops were closed but they are usually 
bereft of goods when open 
early saturday petre roman one of about 20 members of the 
national salvation committee said the committee wanted free 
elections by april and would assure a certain amount of political 
and economic stability in the meantime 
in timisoara the birthplace of the revolt that swept ceausescu 
from power after 24 years of increasingly autocratic rule two 
people were reported killed and six wounded in fighting saturday 
fierce fighting also was reported at various times from the 
cities of brasov arad and sibiu 
relatives continued a grisly search in forests outside timisoara 
through mass graves of corpses most naked and many mutilated of 
victims of a massacre by security forces last weekend 
the protests began when hundreds of people gathered dec 15 to 
rally against the threatened arrest of an ethnic hungarian pastor 
they evolved into huge demonstrations that drew hundreds of 
thousands nationwide 
ceausescu ordered troops to fire on protesters fueling more 
demonstrations 
romanian television said the death toll approached 12000 but 
there was no confirmation 
the revolt reached bucharest on thursday ceausescu and his wife 
fled the city in a helicopter friday

party had split in two one party professing loyalty to its mother 
party in moscow and another larger party that has declared its

about 450 mourners braved snow and freezing 
temperatures saturday to attend the funeral of alderman robert 
robinson the civil rights attorney killed by a mail bomb and 
eulogized as someone who loved politics and people 
he would never let you down savannah naacp president curtis 
cooper told mourners at st pauls cme church he was the type of 
man who could walk with kings but never lost the common touch 
robinson 42 died monday night shortly after a bomb mailed to 
his savannah law office exploded as he opened it he was the second 
victim of mail bombs federal officals believe might have been sent 
by racists with grudge against the 11th us circuit court of 
appeals 
robinsons death came two days after a similar bomb killed 11th 
circuit judge robert s vance and seriously injured his wife at 
their home in a birmingham ala suburb 
despite the cold and more than 2 inches of snow in the savannah 
area mourners packed the church for saturdays service 
the rev henry delaney pastor of st pauls said saturday that 
robinsons death might seem senseless but is part of a higher 
political agenda for black americans 
delaney said the death should be used to propel black politics 
in georgia forward without fear of racist retaliation he pointed 
out that new york city elected its first black mayor shortly after 
a black teenager was shot to death in a predominantly white 
neighborhood 
dont you give up mrs robinson dont you give up mother 
robinson dont you give up children delaney shouted 
addressing robinsons widow mother and two children 
robbie was killed because he was a lawyer and because he 
sought to rectify wrongs said alderman floyd adams his voice 
often cracking with emotion if he were here he would say dont 
look at this as a setback dont be discouraged 
ww law a former president of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people said robinsons life should serve as 
a role model for young people to inspire them to help those 
shackled by social or economic injustice 
there is so much instruction to be learned from this life 
he said he was the model of selfimprovement and worked toward 
the improvement of his community 
state rep jim pannell said robinsons loss should strengthen 
people in their resolve to help each other 
the bombs of hatred will not drive us back he said 
hours before robinson died a parcel bomb was found at the 11th 
circuit building in atlanta the next day another one was 
discovered at the jacksonville fla office of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people 
on friday a county circuit judge in hagerstown md was 
injured when a bomb exploded in his apartment 20 minutes after a 
package was delivered fbi officials said preliminary reports 
indicated the incident was unrelated to the other bombings 
fbi investigators have concentrated on possible racial 
motivations in the slayings 
robinson represented the naacp in a desegregation case involving 
savannah schools 
agents determined that vance wrote an opinion in an unrelated 
jacksonville school desegregation case in september that was a 
victory for the naacp a threejudge panel of the appeals court 
unanimously reversed a lower courts ruling that jacksonville could 
stop busing students because the school system was integrated

doctors say heavy cracksmoking is making 
addicts critically ill with symptoms similar to pneumonia 
according to a published report 
the condition which has been dubbed cracklung is not readily 
detected unless patients tell doctors of their crack addiction the 
new york times reported in sunday editions if not treated 
properly it can lead to death 
the condition has been identified in four innercity hospitals 
in detroit and the problem also has been recognized in new york and 
baltimore the newspaper said 
while giving outward signs of suffering from pneumonia the 
patients do not respond to antibiotics or other antipneumonia 
treatments 
scientists remain unsure what causes the condition but some 
believe it is caused by a variation of any number of ailments that 
occur when poisonous compounds are introduced into the lungs the 
times said the condition also may be caused by other drugs used in 
combination with crack or used to produce the cocainederivative 
dr dana g kissner a detroit pulmonary specialist said 
cracklung patients suffer severe chest pains and breathing 
problems and often have high temperatures and cough up blood 
kissner who with four other colleagues reported the condition 
in the journal radiology said the young people he saw with the 
condition were smoking between 15 and 25 pipes of crack a day 
one thing that makes the condition unique is the absence of an 
infectious organism a virus or bacterium and the 
ineffectiveness of antibiotics in fighting it kissner said 
but the condition can be successfully treated with 
corticosteriods which are antiinflammatory drugs kissner said 
dr james t kennedy an associate professor at the new york 
university school of medicine said he has seen about 24 young 
people with the condition in the last two years

the united mine workers and pittston co 
failed saturday in a lastditch effort to reach a prechristmas 
settlement in a bitter nearly 9monthold strike by 1700 coal 
miners in three states 
negotiations recessed saturday evening with an agreement that 
both sides would return to the bargaining table wednesday 
governmentappointed mediator wj usery who had said he wanted 
to end the strike by christmas told both sides he expected to 
settle the dispute by next friday according to sources familiar 
with the talks because of a gag order imposed by usery the 
sources would talk only on the condition of anonymity 
a settlement by the end of next week would allow the virginia 
west virginia and kentucky miners to return to work after the 
traditional holiday shutdown of mining operations 
striking mine workers in castlewood va said they were not 
surprised that contract talks were called off 
i wasnt expecting too much said bob dixon a umw local 
president from st paul va we did not want to get our hopes up 
that way they dont get shot down 
miners pulling the late shift at the picket shack in mcclure 
va agreed with dixon its kind of what i expected said a 
miner who did not want to be identified it was not realistic to 
expect so much so soon 
usery hoping to meet his goal had the two sides at the table 
virtually around the clock all week taking a break at midnight 
friday but calling negotiators back to the table saturday morning 
considerable progress was made in the past few days but usery 
decided to recess the bargaining until next week because it was 
clear that an agreement could not be reached drafted and approved 
in time for the bargainers to make it home for christmas 
the possibility of a settlement kept labor secretary elizabeth 
dole who appointed usery in washington delaying a trip she 
planned to north carolina for christmas 
the nearly 1700 miners struck pittstons coal subsidiary on 
april 5 walking off the job at mines in virginia west virginia 
and kentucky after working 14 months without a contract 
wages never have been a major sticking point instead the 
walkout was prompted by pittstons refusal to participate in an 
industry agreement on how to fund costly miners retirement and 
health plans 
the talks are being closely followed throughout the coal 
industry because of the implications a settlement might have on 
future discussions about the benefit plans 
the strike has been costly for both sides 
the union has paid the strikers about 200 a week in benefits 
and is facing fines totallying 635 million for violating court 
orders limiting picketing and other strike activities last week 
the union said it would give striker a 1250 christmas bonus 
although pittston hired replacement workers production has been 
well below prestrike levels the company reported that its coal 
operations lost 36 million in the second quarter of 1989 and 98 
million in the third quarter compared to profits of 9 million and 
74 million in the respective quarters of 1988 
the company has said special security requirements to protect 
replacement workers and equipment has cost more than 10 million 
at times the strike has turned violent 
thousands of striking miners were arrested as a result of 
demonstrations in the early months of the strike several strikers 
also have been arrested in connection with violence against 
replacement workers at some of the mines

artist giorgio cavallon considered a pioneer of 
abstract expressionism has died at age 85 
cavallon who died friday night at new york hospital had a 
following among poets and painters even though his work was not 
widely known 
i had conditioned myself to think of him as a lesser artist 
but he kept showing us to be wrong in that said william agee a 
historian of american art 
abstract expressionism is characterized by an emphasis on the 
artists spontaneous and selfexpressive application of paint in

during world war i he lived on an uncles farm where he drew in 
the earth or scratched drawings on bombshells

in springfield mass six years later he moved to new york 
he began as a figurative painter at the national academy of 
design he began exploring abstract expressionism in the 1930s but 
like other abstract expressionists did not take the full plunge 
until the late 1940s 
in 1936 he was a founding member of the american abstract 
artists a contentious and polemical group that championed the 
cause of abstract art 
cavallon preferred to do everything by hand including building 
his own freezer stove and sofa he even made his own paints 
his work was exhibited in several new york galleries and last 
year was shown at the peggy guggenheim foundation in venice italy 
his work is in several major museums collections including new 
yorks metropolitan museum of art and museum of modern art

leaking butane gas exploded saturday at an 
amoco oil co refinery killing one worker and injuring another a 
company spokesman said 
amoco and casper firefighters took three hours to put out the 
blaze which began with a flash of fire around 630 am 
rick nemitz 33 was killed when the gas ignited as he was 
shutting down an outdoor refinery unit and was either blown to the 
ground or fell from an upper deck according to spokesman d allen 
miller 
kurt sides 31 who had been working on the ground suffered 
second and thirddegree burns to his face and left hand miller 
said sides was in stable condition at wyoming medical center 
we dont have any idea what ignited the butane miller said 
at this point we dont even know the extent of the damage 
no one else was in the area at the time of the blast miller 
said the unit which combines butane and other gases to produce 
highoctane gasoline will be shut down until investigators can 
determine the cause of the blaze 
the leak occurred at the connection point of two pipes miller 
said

butane before the blast because such gas leaks usually dissipate 
into the air he said he didnt know what ignited the gas

administration were investigating the accident the spokesman said 
amoco oil is a subsidiary of amoco corp

a toplevel syrian envoy said saturday the 
presidents of egypt and syria will soon meet to put an end to a 
12year rift 
the emissary vice president abdelhalim khaddam strongly 
indicated after talks with president hosni mubarak that the two 
countries will resume diplomatic relations 
khaddam the highest ranking syrian official to visit egypt 
since 1977 arrived saturday with what he called a message of 
amity and brotherhood from president hafez assad to the egyptian 
leader 
the coming meeting between the two presidents will lead to 
practical and concrete results in rectifying the status of 
egyptiansyrian relations khaddam told reporters after 
conferring privately with mubarak for about 1 hours 
asked specifically whether the summit would bring restored 
diplomatic ties khaddam said when we speak about rectifying the 
status of relations we mean a comprehensive approach not a narrow 
one 
egypt and syria together fought israel in the 1973 middle east 
war but syria broke ties four years later in response to 
thenpresident anwar sadats historic visit to jerusalem in 
november 1977 which led to a peace treaty 
syria was only one of 17 arab states that broke ties with egypt 
over its peace initiative with israel all but syria and libya have 
since renewed ties 
khaddam said the summit will be in the very near future he 
said assad and mubarak would decide where and when to meet 
egyptianlibyan relations improved considerably this year 
without full diplomatic reconciliation mubarak and libyan leader 
moammar gadhafi have met three times since october and have agreed 
on broad economic cooperation between their countries

a county republican party two gop 
assemblymen and their campaign workers have agreed to pay 400000 
to settle a lawsuit accusing them of hiring uniformed guards to 
intimidate hispanic voters a lawyer said 
under the proposed settlement none of the defendants would 
admit any wrongdoing said darryl wold attorney for the orange 
county republican party 
but he said friday their four insurance companies each would pay 
100000 to the plaintiffs five hispanic voters and the orange 
county democratic party 
a federal judge must approve the settlement the lawsuit had 
been scheduled for trial jan 16 in us district court 
state and federal agencies are still investigating the posting 
of guards at 20 polling places in predominantly hispanic voter 
areas of santa ana on nov 8 1988 when assemblyman curt pringle 
of garden grove defeated democrat christian rick thierbach by 
843 votes for an assembly seat 
the guards carried signs in english and spanish warning that 
noncitizens cannot legally vote 
hispanic community leaders complained it was racially motivated 
intimidation county gop officials responded that the guards were 
there only to monitor and report election fraud 
pringle and another defendant assemblyman john r lewis of 
orange could not be reached for comment saturday calls placed to 
their offices rang unanswered and directory assistance had no home 
numbers listed for them 
michael g balmages chairman of the county democratic party 
praised the settlement but said he was sorry the case would not be 
going to trial 
the plaintiffs will not get their day in court and the public 
will be deprived of learning more about the illegal 
unconstitutional and highly unethical acts that were committed by 
the orange county republican party and the campaign of mr 
pringle he said 
a million dollars would not compensate for this infringement 
on our civil rights said reuben martinez treasurer of the 
county democratic party 
joseph remcho the plaintiffs chief attorney expects the 
settlement will be approved he said a court order prevented him 
from discussing it further before all parties sign it

romanian exiles rejoiced saturday at the downfall of president 
nicolae ceausescu and the prospect of democracy in their homeland 
but sadness over the uprisings heavy human toll tempered their 
celebrations 
i am happy for the romanian people but im crying for the 
thousands of people who have died said lucien gozariu who 
joined about 200 people at a rally in downtown detroit 
ceausescu ran his country virtually as a family fiefdom for 24 
years but a popular revolt lasting only a week toppled the soviet 
blocs last stalinist dictator on friday 
reformminded insurgents claimed to control romania on saturday 
after two days of fighting in which hundreds are believed to have 
died thousands more were reported killed during crackdowns earlier 
in the uprising 
an indiana professor who was making his way out of romania on 
friday after teaching english there said the entire city of 
bucharest seemed to be in the streets after the ceausescu regime 
fell 
i have never seen so much joy such smiles on their faces 
sam longmire of evansville said friday night in a telephone 
interview from frankfurt west germany 
one young woman discovered i was american and hugged me and 
kissed me and wouldnt let me go until her friends pulled her off 
and back into the parade he said 
at the detroit rally romanians cheered when told of reports 
that ceausescu had been captured by the romanian army 
they should put him in a cage and march him around the country 
and let the people do to him what they want said ioan borod 
some people carried pictures of ceausescu with a circle drawn 
around his head with the words spit here written in magic 
marker 
rev roman braga spiritual advisor to the romanian orthodox 
convent near jackson mich cautioned against vengeance 
it will take some time to rebuild braga said the people 
must forgive and forget because with hatred you cant accomplish 
anything 
many at the rally werent in a forgiving mood at one point 
several people threatened a priest claiming he was an agent of 
romanias secret police 
he is an agent of ceausescu even in the united states they 
spy on us said gozariu who left romania in 1977 the priest 
fled before violence could erupt 
a romanianamerican in chicago remembered the victims in their 
homeland and the dictator whose reign of repression had ended 
my heart is with the people who died said viorel catarama 
33 who runs a construction company in suburban hinsdale they 
paid the price but its worth it in a way 
i hope for the best i hope for democracy i hope for freedom 
of speech freedom of religion freedom to express yourself and 
most of all now id like to see the president being brought to 
justice catarama said 
in new york exiles who had protested nightly during the past 
week outside the romanian mission to the united nations celebrated 
there friday night sipping champagne waving romanian flags 
stripped of the socialist symbol and chanting victory victory 
some had spoken to friends and relatives in romania earlier 
friday 
my mother was crying all she could say was im free 
horia dugala 26 said after speaking with his mother in brasov 
the members of the new yorkbased coalition of groups called 
romania 21 held another demonstration outside the mission saturday 
and appealed to the international community to send medicine 
blood weapons and united nations troops to their country 
our people need weapons said the rev aurel radulescu head 
of romania 21 we dont want foreign troops in romania only un 
troops to stop the killing we cannot do it alone we need the help 
of the american people and of the united nations to stop the crimes 
and killings 
about 400 people including people of romanian hungarian and 
chinese descent rallied outside san franciscos city hall friday 
night and chanted free romania free china thank you america1 
some exiles in south floridas romanian community credited 
olympic gymnast nadia comaneci for helping trigger the uprising by 
defecting last month 
i think that nadias escape woke up a lot of people said 
emil pintilie of hollywood she was the first step that made 
people start protesting so that ceausescu would go away 
comaneci was in new york and could not be located for comment 
emile popa who defected in 1987 while working for the romanian 
government in this country said ceausescus fall was the best 
christmas present his family could receive 
his wife cornelia 35 and their children maria 7 and roxana 
3 waited more than two years for permission to leave romania and 
were reunited with popa during thanksgiving week 
i dont care if we dont get anything else im just happy

two thousand fresh american troops were 
airlifted to panama on saturday as us commanders conceded alarm 
over the unexpectedly stiff resistance by forces still loyal to 
fugitive gen manuel antonio noriega 
the reinforcements including a helicopter company were sent 
from the armys 7th light infantry division at fort ord calif 
and joined 24000 other us soldiers many of them boneweary on 
day four of the nations largest combat operation since the vietnam 
war 
it is an operation that has turned quickly from the conventional 
warfare of the initial strike which virtually neutralized the 
panamanian defense forces to the more perplexing mission of 
countering guerrilla attacks and policing a nation in institutional 
chaos

listed friday had been killed in the fighting officials also said

wounded there was no official count of casualties among panamanian 
civilians

armored vehicles with an increasing number of arms laid down 
voluntarily by surrendering members of the panamanian defense 
forces including the garrison which guarded the presidential 
palace the number of pdf detainees totaled 2250 according to 
gen maxwell thurman head of the us southern command 
despite the massive recovery of weapons commanders said 
noriegas dignity battalions continued to draw fresh arms and 
ammunition for hitadrun attacks upon troops and civilians 
one american officer said the loyalists of the selfstyled 
maximum leader whose whereabouts remained undetermined had 
used ambulances to shuttle their weaponry around panama city 
still thurman briefing reporters in panama offered several 
bits of good news late in the day he said 
nine employees of evergreen international airlines an american 
cargo carrier had been released by pronoriega forces and 
evacuated by us troops to the safety of howard afb according to 
thurman the airline employees had been stripped to their underwear 
and beaten but were not seriously hurt 
the effort to create a new panamanian police force under the 
new usinstalled government of guillermo endara was proceeding 
at an encouraging pace today we brought down 750 uniforms and 
1000 people showed up he said 
the people are cooperating with us and are beginning to lay 
down their weapons the general said in areas torn both by 
looting and combat he said people are cleaning up the 
debris 
cbs news meanwhile reported that cbs producer jonathan 
meyersohn who had been held by pronoriega forces since the early 
hours of the us assault had been released 
thurman while stressing progress in the effort to pacify the 
pdf conceded that does not mean were over and done with with 
the dignity battalions the guerrillastyled irregulars still 
loyal to noriega 
the southern command also reported that prisoners at an island 
penitentiary in the pacific about 60 miles from the capital 
apparently had overcome their pronoriega guards and had radioed 
for help from american forces the prison group was said to include 
some of the former panamanian officers who led a failed coup 
attempt on oct 3 
lt col jerry marguila spokesman for the southern command 
said saturday that the dignity battalions were increasing their 
activities of harassing attacks with small arms and mortar fire 
threatening the civilian population and hostagetaking 
pressed for specifics marguila replied i dont have in my 
mind an increase in numbers between today and yesterday of 
dignitybattalion efforts its just that they are becoming more of 
a concern because they are taking more of our time as opposed to 
the pdf 
at the pentagon one military official speaking on condition of 
anonymity conceded the ferocity of the dignity battalions had 
caught us commanders off guard 
a pentagon spokesman also said the f117 stealth fighterbomber 
was among the new weapons used for the first time during combat in 
the panama attack lt cmdr edward lundquist said the plane which 
is designed to evade enemy radar was used successfully on one 
mission bombing a field near a pdf barracks to create confusion 
and alarm among the enemy 
defense secretary dick cheney was at his office on saturday to 
keep tabs on developments in panama as well as the bloody 
revolution which ousted romanian dictator nicolae ceausescu 
president bush was at camp david md where he worked on a 
christmas eve address to the american military men and women around

police on saturday interviewed neighbors 
of a county judge and a letter carrier who delivered a package to 
his apartment but found no leads into the bomb attack that wounded 
the judge authorities said 
postal inspectors confirmed saturday night that the pipe bomb 
was delivered through the mail 
washington county circuit judge john p cordermans condition 
was upgraded to good at washington county hospital one day after a 
pipe bomb sent shrapnel into his hand and groin and damaged his 
eardrums 
dr charles chaney said the judges ears were still ringing from 
the blast but his hearing had improved corderman now suffers a 25 
percent hearing loss in both ears down from a loss of as much as 
75 percent initially chaney said 
his sense of humor remains intact the physician said 
when told of the holes in both eardrums he quipped there goes 
scuba diving 
postal inspectors agents of the fbi and the federal bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms and hagerstown police investigating 
the bombing believe it wasnt related to four parcel bombs 
delivered in the southeast in the past week police lt robert 
frick said 
two of those bombs exploded killing a federal judge in a 
birmingham ala suburb dec 16 and an alderman who was also a 
civil rights attorney in savannah on monday 
bombs were found and defused last week at the jacksonville 
fla chapter of the national association for the advancement of 
colored people and the federal courthouse in atlanta investigators 
are focusing on a possible racial motivation in those cases 
frick said investigators didnt have a lead theory in the 
hagerstown bombing its so early in the investigation he 
said we havent fixed our investigation on a particular track 
from what i know corderman doesnt have any idea who may 
have wanted to do this to him he said 
frick said investigators were reviewing cordermans cases 
authorities said they saw no link with the southeast bombings 
but said the attack could have been a copycat crime 
authorities believe a second unexploded bomb found in the 
apartment was delivered in the same package as the pipe bomb that 
bomb was disarmed and alcohol tobacco and firearms officers took 
it and other evidence to the agencys laboratory in rockville 
the us postal inspection service confirmed that the pipe bomb 
packaged in a christmas food gift box was sent through the mail 
and not through some other delivery service said spokesman paul 
griffo in washington 
it basically changes the picture of the investigation 
griffo said now the postal inspection service will be the lead 
agency in the investigation because weve determined that the bomb 
arrived through the mail and not through a delivery person 
the inspection service stopped short however of naming letter 
carrier robert l miller sr the only carrier on cordermans 
route as the person who delivered the bomb 
earlier saturday investigators interviewed miller who said he 
delivered a flat rectangular box to cordermans downtown apartment 
about 1245 pm friday nearly two hours before the 230 pm 
explosion miller said he left the box leaning against the door 
when no one answered 
the carrier said he believed the box contained perishable food 
because the cardboard had a waxy oily texture 
they showed me a picture of a blownup hickory farms box with 
his name on it but i dont know if i delivered a hickory farms box 
or not it just looked like a normal package that came from a 
business said miller 42 
they keep asking me about postage and return addresses i 
dont know i think there was a return address but im not sure 
he said 
doctors said the judge who had been in stable condition after 
surgery friday to remove shrapnel could be released from the 
hospital as early as christmas day 
chaney said doctors removed pieces of leadcolored pipe from 
cordermans groin and right hand and reconstructed the top half of 
the middle finger on the judges right hand which had lost its tip 
several judges and other officials visited corderman along with 
members of his family who have declined to comment corderman also 
refused interviews 
hes in very good spirits county circuit judge daniel 
moylan said hes very grateful that hes alive 
corderman who had been a judge for 12 years was known as one 
of the toughest judges in the county he was known for handing down 
harsh sentences especially in drugrelated cases he also has been 
an outspoken advocate of gun control and has spoken out on 
controversial issues such as club gambling

junk bond defaults soared to 6 billion in 1989 
as the number and value of new issues sank to fouryear lows in a 
market battered by a weak economy and sagging corporate profits 
industry data show 
while the 200 billion market appeared to stabilize toward 
yearend it didnt recover from an autumn bruising that sent prices 
plummeting investors fleeing and companies scrambling to meet 
hefty interest payments 
junk bonds are so called because they are considered below 
investment grade and therefore offer high yields to investors in 
exchange for the higher risk of default they have been one of the 
most important tools for financing takeovers and corporate growth 
moodys investors service inc a creditrating agency 
downgraded 152 junk bond issuing companies in the first 11 months 
of the year compared with 110 for all of 1988 the ratio of 
downgrades to upgrades through november was 28 sharply higher 
than 16 last year 
meanwhile the average net asset value of junkbond mutual funds 
declined 10 percent on average this year according to moodys 
the troubling fact is it occurred while the economy was still 
growing moodys senior economist john lonski said this begs 
the question of what the deterioration of junk bond credit will 
look like in the event of a recession 
lower credit ratings mean companies have to pay higher interest 
rates to borrow money the lower a companys credit rating the 
riskier its securities are considered 
a moodys report estimates that a total of 6 billion in junk 
bond debt belonging to 50 companies will have entered default in 
1989 that compares with an annual average of about 4 billion in 
recent years 
among the most publicized defaults in the market that dates only 
to the late1970s were integrated resources inc at close to 1 
billion and southmark corp at about 700 million 
the situation shows no sign of getting much better lonski 
said we expect that in 1990 the default rate will climb to its 
1989 pace 
the junk bond market hit the skids in september when campeau 
corp which used 3 billion in junk financing to create a 
retailing empire missed some interest payments because of a cash 
squeeze 
dollar volume of junk bond issues this year through last 
wednesday totaled 53 billion down 86 percent from 1988 and 21 
percent from the peak year of 1986 according to securities data co 
there were 131 new issues for the 1989 period vs 160 in 1988 
190 in 1987 and 226 in 1986 the data showed it was the lowest 
since 131 new issues in 1984 
lonski said rjr nabisco incs single 4 billion issue of the 
securities used to complete the companys record 25 billion 
debtfinanced takeover accounted for the biggest chunk of the new 
issue value 
he said junk bonds in 1989 were used less frequently than in 
past years for traditional financing purposes such as the expansion 
of business 
drexel burnham lambert inc remained atop the junk bond charts 
though its market share fell below 40 percent for the first time 
ever drexel underwrote 97 billion in highyield bonds through 
wednesday securities data reported 
in its highyield review for december drexel acknowledged 
the markets problems but said the difference in yields between 
junk bonds and governmentissued treasury securities remained wide 
drexel said junk bond yields often as much as 17 percent still 
outweighs the risk of default drexel long has maintained that a 
diversified portfolio of junk bonds compensates for defaults 
the firm which pioneered the bonds through its nowindicted 
former executive michael milken said the governmentmandated 
withdrawal of savings and loans and redemptions by mutual funds 
amid bad publicity hurt the market most this year 
individual investors decided to withdraw not so much on sound 
credit analysis as on herd instinct the drexel report said 
the general perception that there was something wrong with 
junk bonds the identity of the securities was now completely 
separate from the companies that issued them sank deeper into the 
public consciousness it said 
the wall street firm hurt by the weakness and its settlement of 
unprecedented federal insider trading charges said bad press about 
highyield defaults hurt liquidity and led mutual funds to pull out 
on the other hand these stories helped create market 
imperfections from which astute investors can profit drexel 
said we believe that is the case today
