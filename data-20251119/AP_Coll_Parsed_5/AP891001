china celebrated the 40th anniversary of 
communist rule sunday with song dance and warnings there can be no 
deviation from the socialist road 
beijing was awash with red flags set against a perfect blue 
autumn sky as hundreds of thousands of people on bicycle and 
crammed buses streamed to parks for free entertainment 
police and the military kept a visible presence as the capital 
under martial law since the student protests this spring sought to 
prevent any attempts by counterrevolutionary forces to disrupt 
the national day festivities 
banners warned of the evils of bourgeois liberalization or 
favoring western ideas the communist partys official peoples 
daily renmin ribao stressed that history shows only socialism 
can save china 
at the neonlit great hall of the people on saturday night 
premier li peng hosted a reception for chinese officials and 
foreign diplomats he used his toast to applaud the great 
victory over prodemocracy protesters 
we should devote major efforts to the strengthening of public 
order and firmly crack down on all kinds of criminal activities 
he said 
li also said china faces at least three years of a tightmoney 
policy to reduce inflation and other serious economic problems and 
noted that payments on its 40 billion foreign debt increase next 
year giving rise to new difficulties 
the leading cadres should work hard set a good example 
and share a life of frugality with the whole people for the next 
few years li said 
he concluded his 20minute speech with a toast to the 
anniversary and the vigorous development of our socialist 
modernization 
most foreign ambassadors stationed in beijing attended the 
reception and joined in the toast but western ambassadors walked 
out before the start of a songanddance program that included 
several numbers by military troupes 
the finale featured dancers clad in army uniforms goosestepping 
across the stage in front of a huge red chinese flag 
ambassadors from the united states canada japan and the 
european community have said they will not attend dances and 
fireworks sunday in tiananmen square one embassys spokesman cited 
the particular meaning of tiananmen and added we dont feel 
its time yet to become that cozy to celebrate 
the square adjoining the great hall was the center of the 
protests and the students surrendered it only when surrounded by 
tanks and troops who shot their way into the capital killing 
hundreds and possibly thousands of people 
the vast square was aglow saturday night from strings of lights 
on surrounding buildings and trees a redandwhite neon sign on 
top of the great hall flashed the dates 19491989 
redandblue neon signs flashed vigorously develop china and 
long live the motherland on each side of the tiananmen rostrum 
where revolutionary leader mao tsetung proclaimed the founding of 
the peoples republic on oct 1 1949 
thousands of chinese normally jam the square and surrounding 
blocks on the eve of national day to enjoy the lights and elaborate 
flower arrangements but this year the square has been open only to 
select organized groups and no one was allowed in saturday night 
more than 100000 people including soldiers workers and 
students are to perform folkstyle dances in the square on sunday 
and again only people with special passes distributed by their 
work units will be allowed in 
however even some chinese with passes have said they are 
nervous about going because of vague rumors of a possible bomb 
attack by people angry over the june crackdown authorities have 
warned sternly against any attempts to sabotage the holiday but 
have not said if any threats have been made 
security also was tighter at beijing university whose students 
helped lead the spring protests 
international congratulations were muted due to widespread 
condemnation of chinas crackdown on the student protesters 
the only countries to send special delegations were north korea 
czechoslovakia east germany pakistan burundi kenya and cuba 
the soviet union sent the vice chairman of the sovietchinese 
friendship society 
former us secretary of state alexander haig now a private 
business consultant attended saturdays reception as an honored 
guest walking in with the chinese leaders 
hes a businessman and thats good business us ambassador 
james lilley said of haigs visit the us government like most 
western countries halted highlevel exchanges after the june 
crackdown 
one of the highestranking officials ousted in the june 
crackdown hu qili made his first public appearance since then at 
the saturday night party hu reportedly apologized for his 
political errors unlike ousted party general secretary zhao 
ziyang who still has not reappeared

an extremely potent form of heroin that 
appeared in the city recently has caused dozens of overdoses and 
one death and is overwhelming hospitals officials said saturday 
at least 42 people have overdosed on the mexican black tar 
heroin since friday morning and doctors are barely able to handle 
all the patients crowding the hallways said dr ronald dieckman 
emergency room physician at san francisco general hospital where 
38 of the victims were treated 
the emergency room staff heard about the other victims by 
canvassing other hospitals ambulance drivers reported additional 
uncounted cases dieckman said 
it appears to be the influx of a large amount of an extremely 
powerful drug dumped into the bay area over the weekend we were 
overwhelmed dieckman said typically two or three overdoses 
would have occurred in that period he said 
all of the patients had stopped breathing and one 33yearold 
man whose name the hospital did not release died of an overdose 
others have sustained brain damage as a result of oxygen 
deprivation to the brain dieckman said the staff has been too 
busy handling the crisis to complete an accurate count of the 
injuries he said 
some of these patients are the chronic street users but we 
have also seen a whole number of occasional users who are coming in 
and are overdosed on it dieckman said

the citys health department says it has 
documented the first two cases in which men have become infected 
with the aids virus through oral sex 
if people have bargained that oral sex is what theyre going 
to do and stay uninfected we now have direct evidence that it can 
happen dr george rutherford director of the departments aids 
office said friday 
the findings came in the study of hundreds of gay and bisexual 
men that the health department has been conducting since the early 
days of the aids epidemic 
city health director dr david werdegar acknowledged the 
findings were based on interviews with the subjects rather than 
clinical evidence but said researchers were absolutely sure the 
two gay men had contracted the human immunodeficincy virus through 
oral sex 
we believe we got very accurate information said werdegar 
who added that the subjects trusted the health department 
researchers and had worked with them over a long period 
the research team headed by rutherford and dr alan lifson is 
preparing to submit the results to either the journal of the 
american medicl association or the new england journal of medicine 
werdegar said 
both men who tested positive for the hiv virus reported having 
performed oral sex on numerous partners rutherford said 
other clinicians have reported a few other examples of people 
becoming infected through oral sex but the health departments 
findings were the first time such a transmission had been 
documented in a major study rutherford said 
former surgeon general c everett kopp warned three years ago 
that oral sex might be a transmission path for the aids virus but 
some health authorities and parts of the gay community had started 
to believe otherwise the citys gay and lesbian press in recent 
months has debated the issue and some private sex clubs allow the 
practice 
there have been a lot of questions about oral sex but this 
indicates it definitely is a risk werdegar said of the findings 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring 
the scientific name for the virus is human immunodeficiency 
virus or hiv 
as of july 31 the federal centers for disease control in 
atlanta had recorded a cumulative total of 102621 cases of aids in 
the united states with 59391 deaths

cheering and weeping with joy the 
first of more than 4000 east german refugees who holed up in west 
german embassies in czechoslovakia and poland arrived in the west 
on sunday 
east germany on saturday agreed to the exodus after a remarkable 
accord between soviet bloc and nato nations ended a deadlock that 
forced many of the refugees to spend weeks camping outside the 
embassies 
the first train carrying about 780 east germans who had sought 
refuge in the west german embassy in prague czechoslovakia arrived 
in the bavarian city of hof at 614 am 114 am edt several 
hundred local residents applauded and cheered as the train pulled 
into the station 
the agreement announced saturday covered nearly 3500 east 
germans who began crowding into the embassy in prague several weeks 
ago and more than 800 east germans at the embassy in warsaw poland 
early sunday bavarian radio in west germany said about half the 
3500 refugees in prague were en route 
in poland 809 refugees boarded an east german train that left 
warsaws eastern station before dawn sunday headed for the west 
german border city of helmstedt 
the accord and its details were announced by officials in west 
germany east germany czechoslovakia and poland 
east germany a hardline communist nation that had harshly 
criticized warsaw pact ally hungary for allowing a similar refugee 
exodus earlier this month said it was granting the transfer as a 
humanitarian act and spoke of the refugees being expelled 
there was no explicit mention of the policy toward future 
refugees but adn the official east german news agency said east 
germany hoped west germany would follow normal international 
customs at its embassies abroad after the transfer 
that appeared to indicate east germany would oppose continuing 
emigration of its citizens to the west west german officials in 
bonn could not be reached for comment saturday night 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher made an 
unexpected visit to prague saturday and delivered the news to 
jubilant east germans at the embassy 
i call you fellow citizens and express a hearty welcome 
genscher speaking from an embassy balcony told the weary but 
ecstatic masses huddled in the muddy compound 
he told reporters the solution was agreed on early saturday in 
consultations with the east germans czechoslovaks and poles 
some of the refugees had spent weeks huddled in tents and on 
cots in the embassy compound amid growing crowding spreading 
disease and worsening weather 
the first train left prague saturday night an olive green east 
german locomotive left the citys northern rail terminal at 850 
pm local time pulling nine passenger cars 
about 400 east germans were on board some cheering others 
singing still others appearing a little dazed by the sudden end to 
their ordeal 
we are coming we are coming a group of young refugees 
yelled in unison from an open train window as czechoslovak 
uniformed police looked on impassively 
a young woman from dresden said as she was about to board i 
cant believe it tell me its not a dream 
adn said trains were to carry the prague emigres back to east 
germany from czechoslovakia and on to west germany czechoslovak 
state television said the east germans were to be issued exit 
papers while en route to west germany 
the route was seen as a facesaving measure permitting east 
germany to say that it had allowed the emigres to go to west 
germany from its territory and not from czechoslovakia a warsaw 
pact ally that had vowed not to allow the transfer 
in munich west germany a bavarian goverment spokesman said by 
telephone he believed the trains would leave in intervals of about 
two hours with the first expected in the bavarian city of hof 
early sunday 
the refugees will be housed in emergency quarters maintained by 
the bavarian border police said a police spokesman the bavarian 
official and the police spokesmen spoke on condition of anonymity 
in poland the east germans assembled at the west german embassy 
in warsaw 
the refugees some of whom had been allowed to stay in nearby 
residential neighborhoods reacted with cheering and weeping 
i am happy i am happy one young man said through the bars 
of the compound gates 
west german law automatically granting east germans citizenship 
on arrival has contributed to more than 100000 east germans 
fleeing to west germany so far this year 
the east germans have flooded to west germany because of 
disillusionment with political repression and economic stagnation 
in their homeland 
more than 23000 east germans emigrated over hungarys western 
border since sept 10 when hungarian authorities authorized free 
passage to austria of east germans seeking a new life in the west 
hundreds of likeminded east germans allowed unhindered travel 
into neighboring czechoslovakia but without the necessary documents 
for hungary began crowding the west german embassy in prague weeks 
ago 
others crossed illegally from czechoslovakia into hungary to 
flee west but hundreds more asked for sanctuary at the embassy in 
prague after czechoslovak authorities turned them back at the 
border or began confiscating visas valid for hungary in an apparent 
effort to stanch the westward flow of east germans 
east germany czechoslovakia and other hardline warsaw pact 
countries have been critical of reformminded hungary for 
permitting the exodus 
in east berlin adn quoted east german foreign ministry 
spokesman wolfgang meyer as saying 
in efforts to end the intolerable situation at the west german 
embassies in prague and warsaw that was not brought about by east 
germany the east german government arranged that these people 
illegally at the embassies will be expelled to west germany across 
east german territory with trains of the west german railroad 
asked for details on the agreement to let the east germans 
emigrate a west german government spokesman in bonn referred to 
talks genscher conducted in recent days outside of a session of the 
un general assembly in new york 
genscher had met with his czechoslovak east german polish 
soviet us and french counterparts about the refugee standoffs

a second strong earthquake in as many 
days struck eastern burma near the thai border early sunday the 
meteorological department said shaking tall buildings in the thai 
capital hundreds of miles away 
the quake measuring 60 on the richter scale was centered 
about 12 miles west of the northern thai province of chiang mai an 
official said on condition of anonymity 
there were no immediate reports of casualties 
tremors could be felt as far away as bangkok about 360 miles to 
the south tall buildings in the capital shook noticeably 
another earthquake measuring 50 on the richter scale hit the 
same area saturday the official said 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph every increase of one number means that the ground 
motion is 10 times greater 
a quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in populated 
areas

poland rumbled through the night carrying thousands of east german 
refugees to west germany on sunday

be around 7000 far more than originally expected there were 
reports the exodus sparked even more east germans to try to flee 
via prague czechoslovakia

the son of the late philippine president 
ferdinand marcos vowed his family would some day return from exile 
and that his father would be buried in his homeland 
ferdinand bong bong marcos jr defended his fathers memory 
in a speech saturday to the united filipino council of hawaii 
saying his autocratic rule was needed to keep peace in his country 
it really is a period of mourning not a time for politicking 
and speeches the 32yearold son said but this is the end of 
an era and as one chapter closes another opens and i find myself 
facing the awesome responsibility of trying to fill my fathers 
shoes 
the elder marcos died thursday in a honolulu hospital of heart 
failure at age 72 
philippine president corazon aquino who took marcos place when 
the strongman fled to hawaii after a disputed election in 1986 has 
refused to allow marcos remains to be returned for burial for fear 
the return would cause unrest 
the younger marcos repeated a promise made earlier by the former 
first lady imelda marcos that the family would continue to work 
for the return of his fathers remains 
if it takes years he will be brought home the son said 
he also promised the marcos family would return to the 
philippines 
we are not going back to pursue any personal vengeance 
marcos said we are going back to try and help get the 
philippines out of the troubles that it has now 
marcos didnt give specifics 
after the speech marcos declined to rule out the possibility of 
running for office in the philippines but said he didnt forsee it 
happening soon 
during the elder marcos 20year rule the son said he took a 
feudalistic divided nation and made it strong he built the 
economy and gave filipinos a national identity that they could be 
proud of and fight and die for

sometime in the next decade nurses preparing 
patients for routine surgery may draw out a few pints of blood and 
replace it with something the laws of nature would seem to forbid 
cows blood 
cows blood actually just the oxygencarrying part of it is 
one of several substances under development by biotechnology firms 
seeking a safe clean and maybe even superior substitute for what 
flows through human veins 
doctors at massachusetts general hospital hope to begin 
experiments this fall on healthy human volunteers to see if bovine 
blood transfusions are safe extensive human testing will be 
necessary to overcome skepticism about mixing blood between the 
species 
everybody says you cant give cows blood to a human just 
like you cant give some peoples blood to other people said 
carl rausch head of biopure a bostonbased company working on 
this approach but we are talking about just the oxygen transport 
medium which is hemoglobin 
ordinarily blood organs and hormones cannot be swapped between 
cats and mice or people and elephants because they are rejected as 
foreign substances but there are exceptions for instance 
diabetics take cow insulin and pig valves are used as replacements 
in human hearts 
biopure has more than people in mind for its product tufts 
universitys veterinary school plans to test the same cow blood 
intended for humans to treat sick dogs besides opening up a big 
market among veterinarians it envisions a 60 million a year 
business in transfusions for dogs and cats alone biopure hopes 
that by showing bossies blood works fine for tabby and rover 
people will begin to accept the idea that its good for aunt 
gertrude as well 
people are nervous about this because its bovinederived 
said rausch if you can get a substitute to work in a wide range 
of species then the naysayers will have to say it might work 
 
it should work he and others believe because many creatures 
people included produce similar hemoglobin in three years of 
tests animals showed no adverse reaction to cow hemoglobin even 
when it replaced 95 percent of their own blood 
blood fulfills many vital jobs transporting nourishment 
hormones and diseasefighting armaments the substitutes envisioned 
by biopure and others would take the place of just one of these 
components the red cells 
red cells are packed with hemoglobin a molecule that picks up 
oxygen in the lungs and delivers it throughout the body putting 
back hemoglobin usually in the form of red cell transfusions is 
often essential for offsetting the blood loss of accident victims 
and surgical patients 
there have been attempts to make red cell substitutes for a 
quarter of a century said dr harvey g klein chief of 
transfusion medicine at the national institutes of health in 
bethesda md 
northfield labs in northfield ill and baxter travenol in 
fairfield nj among others are developing red cell substitutes 
from expired human blood green cross in japan has made a 
fluorocarbonbased synthetic molecule that can carry oxygen while 
somatagen in broomfield colo is attempting to make human 
hemoglobin through gene splicing 
the great enthusiasm recently is because of the perceived 
increased risk of infection being transmitted by transfusions 
primarily aids klein said red cell substitutes could be 
purified to such an extent that viral contamination wouldnt be an 
issue red cells cant be right now 
despite screening a tiny risk remains of getting aids from a 
transfusion other viruses can also be passed along including 
hepatitis and herpes as well as a variety of foreign proteins 
every time you take blood its like putting a quarter in the 
slot machine said dr charles huggins head of massachusetts 
generals blood bank if you are unlucky and come up with three 
lemons you can get hepatitis or something else 
rausch said bovine hemoglobin is purified to be 99999999999 
percent free of viruses even if a microbe slips through it will 
be a cow germ unlikely to cause a human disease 
among other advantages the substitutes could be given to anyone 
without matching the blood type and unlike real blood which must 
be thrown away after about three weeks the fake varieties would 
last six months and perhaps longer 
huggins who will be participating in the human testing of cow 
blood said i am making every effort to put myself out of 
business 
however dr leon hoyer vice president of research and 
development at the american red cross doubts this will happen 
blood is becoming safer as tests are developed for more viruses he 
said and doubts will linger about the safety of routinely using 
bovine blood and other substitutes 
its going to take a significant number of clinical trials to 
show that they have no toxicity at all its one thing to use them 
when you have no alternative its another to use them electively 
im not sure that they will have an advantage over standard blood 
that is subject to better testing and viral inactivation procedures 
that will get rid of those issues 
even if the substitutes dont replace real red cells experts 
say there are several situations where they might be routinely used 
before such operations as hip replacements which involve the 
loss of large quantities of blood patients might put several pints 
of their own blood in storage and replace it with a hemoglobin 
substitute after the operation their own blood would be put back 
ambulances might carry blood substitutes so transfusions could 
begin immediately for accident victims rather than after they 
arrive at the hospital where their blood type can be matched 
the military would like to develop a freezedried blood 
substitute that could be mixed with sterile water on the 
battlefield so combat victims could be stabilized until they are 
evacuated to hospitals 
they could be used to treat victims of heart attacks and 
strokes because the substitutes are thinner than blood they might 
ooze around clots and carry oxygen to starving tissue preventing 
permanent damage until clots dissolve 
they could be used to keep organs alive until they are 
transplanted 
by boosting oxygen levels they might improve the killing power 
of radiation therapy in treating cancer 
since hemoglobin is a rich source of iron it might increase 
the bodys natural production of new red cells especially when 
combined with a growthstimulating hormone 
one clear advantage of cow blood is the supply of raw material 
rausch estimates 70 million cows are slaughtered in the united 
states each year and each contains five to seven gallons of blood 
most of it goes to waste 
while plasma is salvaged for fish food the red cells are a 
goopy mass that must be dried and taken to a landfill rausch said 
he can buy it for 50 cents a gallon by 1994 when if all goes 
well his product is approved for routine human use rausch 
expects to be able to sell the highly purified substitute for 150 
to 200 a pint the price he believes real blood will cost then

number of psychic healers and mentalists claimed he used his 
powers to stop bicycles automobiles and streetcars 
he thought he was ready for something bigger so he stepped in 
front of a freight train it didnt work 
the engineer of the train that ran frenkel over said the psychic 
stepped onto the tracks with his arms raised his head lowered and 
his body tensed 
the daily sovietskaya rossiya on sunday said investigators 
looking into frenkels decision to jump in front of a train near 
the southern city of astrakhan found the answer in the briefcase he 
left by the side of the track 
first i stopped a bicycle cars and a streetcar frenkel 
wrote in notes that the investigators found now im going to 
stop a train 
frenkel apparently felt he had found the secret of 
psychicbiological power and that his effort to halt a train would 
be the ultimate test of his powers according to the notes only 
in extraordinary conditions of a direct threat to my organism will 
all my reserves be called into action he wrote 
in the last few months the nation has become awash with 
mentalists and selfproclaimed psychics who are appearing on 
staterun television drawing huge crowds and receiving thousands

frenkel also had been proclaimed by local television in 
astrakhan a city at the mouth of the volga river 800 miles 
southeast of moscow as a healer who had managed to help some 
people the report said 
the engineer of the train saw frenkel dressed in a white shirt 
walking along the railroad from a long distance but only at the 
last minute did the mentalist drop his brief case and step onto the 
tracks 
emergency braking didnt help a tragedy occurred the 
newspaper said it did not say what day frenkel was killed or

about 1000 people loyal to ferdinand 
marcos marched through the capital on sunday and demanded that 
president corazon aquino allow the late leaders body to be buried 
in his homeland 
mrs aquino said sunday she will follow any supreme court order 
to allow the return of marcos body but was confident the justices 
would support her ban 
marcos died thursday in honolulu at age 72 mrs aquino banned 
the return of his body on grounds it might cause civil disorder and 
asked the us federal aviation administration to prevent any 
aircraft from violating her order 
attorneys for marcos said they would file a motion monday asking 
the supreme court to reconsider its sept 15 decision dismissing a 
petition to allow marcos to come home 
marcos had lived in exile in hawaii since he was ousted in a 
popular uprising three years ago that propelled mrs aquino to 
power 
in an 87 vote the court agreed with mrs aquino that the 
former presidents return poses a serious threat to national 
interest 
marcos lawyers hope the justices will reconsider now that the 
former president is dead and since the vote on the first 
consideration was so close 
i will certainly respect the decision of the supreme court 
mrs aquino said in her weekly nationwide radio program sunday 
and i believe they can arrive at the best decision possible 
mrs aquino said she believed she could explain to the justices 
what i really want to achieve for the welfare of the country 
she said the ban would be continually reviewed but at this time 
there is really nothing so far to make me change my original 
decision which is not to allow the return of president marcos 
body 
in a statement sunday opposition groups said they would 
exhaust all peaceful and legal means to bring his body home 
the statement by the new society movement and the nacionalista 
party of vice president salvador laurel claimed public opinion 
favored the burial of the former president in the land of his 
birth 
following a meeting at the presidential palace saturday sen 
neptali gonzales said mrs aquino ordered the ban after receiving 
unspecified intelligence information of a national security 
nature gonzales refused to elaborate 
marcos wife imelda is barred from leaving the united states 
because she has been indicted on racketeering charges in the 
alleged embezzlement of philippine government money she is to go 
on trial in new york in march 
despite government fears of unrest the few promarcos rallies 
held since his death have been peaceful 
in sundays march about 1000 loyalists carried banners in a 
downtown park urging mrs aquino to reconsider the ban they later 
marched to camp crame headquarters of the philippine constabulary 
where they held a vigil 
prayer vigils were held at the marcos family home in suburban 
san juan and at the home where he grew up in batac in ilocos norte 
province 250 miles north of manila 
batac mayor jesus nalupta said marcos supporters had decided on 
peaceful protests so as not to give the government another excuse 
for banning the burial

nearly onethird of american adults know someone 
who uses cocaine but most say drug abuse is not a serious problem 
in their own neighborhoods a poll has found 
while president bush pursues a multibilliondollar war on 
illegal drugs saying they are sapping our strength as a 
nation just 14 percent in the survey called the problem very 
serious where they live 
still 61 percent in the media generalassociated press poll 
identified drug abuse as the nations greatest problem overall a 
level that has risen steadily in opinion polls as the issue drew 
increasing political and media attention 
among that majority barely more than a third expected the 
problem to lessen in the next decade and respondents split sharply 
on whether the best line of attack is against drug producers 
dealers or users 
majorities came together though in opposing some priorities of 
bushs program while most of its funds are for law enforcement 
for example 60 percent said treating drug users will accomplish 
more than punishing them 
moreover a 57 percent majority said building more federal 
prison cells for drug offenders as bush has proposed will fail 
to reduce drug abuse drug treatment and education were seen by far 
more people as effective 
despite those differences nearly threequarters of the 1071 
respondents were convinced that the bush administration is making a 
serious effort and twothirds said the federal government can 
reduce drug abuse significantly 
respondents were split on whether bushs 79 billion plan 
spends enough money too little or too much about half wanted 
antidrug money taken from other programs while a third favored 
raising taxes the rest were unsure 
though taxes were not popular generally threequarters 
supported raising cigarette or alcoholic beverage taxes to pay for 
a bigger drug program and seven in 10 supported a 1 percent 
increase in corporate income taxes 
another funding scheme had less support by 5343 percent 
respondents opposed a 1 percent increase in personal income taxes 
the poll conducted sept 1424 had a margin of error of plus 
or minus 3 percentage points 
the national institute on drug abuse has estimated that roughly 
8 million americans have used cocaine in the past year and 1 
million of them use it at least once a week in the survey 31 
percent said they know someone who uses cocaine or its derivative 
crack about half of them or about oneseventh of all respondents 
said they know an addict 
younger people were far more likely to know a cocaine user 48 
percent of those age 1829 said they did black respondents and 
bigcity residents also were more likely to know a cocaine user 
in a speech sept 5 announcing his drug war bush called on 
americans who know drug abusers to help them stop but the poll 
showed the difficulty of that approach of those who knew current 
cocaine users nearly six in 10 said they already have tried to get 
them off drugs 
bigcity dwellers were the most concerned about drugs in their 
neighborhoods with half saying illegal drugs posed a very or 
somewhat serious problem where they live as opposed to not 
too or not at all serious 
in the nation as a whole four in 10 rated drugs a serious local 
problem and nearly six in 10 did not 
the poll found overwhelming objection to illegal drug use in a 
variety of scenarios including buying and selling marijuana or 
cocaine least offensive was growing marijuana for personal use at 
home twentysix percent found that unobjectionable 
respondents favored some new punishments for occasional drug 
users with 82 percent saying people caught with drugs in their 
cars should have their licenses suspended and 63 percent saying 
the cars should be confiscated 
people were split about evenly however on the notion of 
sending occasional drug users to militarystyle boot camps 
when pupils are caught with drugs at school 99 percent said 
their parents should be told and 78 percent said the police should 
be told six in 10 said the pupil should be suspended while most 
opposed expulsion 
to stop the flow of drugs into this country eight in 10 
respondents said bush should order the military to patrol the 
borders for smugglers but a minority of 43 percent said he should 
order military strikes against illegal drug operations in foreign 
countries

led by chief justice william h rehnquist a 
conservative supreme court majority solidified last spring to veer 
the court dramatically to the right the question now is whether 
rehnquist can keep the momentum rolling into the 1990s 
the 198990 term beginning monday will offer the beginning of 
an answer by july although the courts decision docket is not yet 
as packed with ideologically divisive issues as it was last term 
that could change as the justices begin taking on new cases 
the opportunities through the cases will always present 
themselves university of michigan law professor yale kamisar 
says with a dread shared by many liberals the chief justice 
should have no problem keeping the court busy taking the life out 
of liberal precedents 
the rehnquist court came of age last term by cutting back 
abortion rights curtailing affirmative action for women and 
minorities limiting civil rights protections condoning mandatory 
drug testing and permitting capital punishment for juveniles and 
retarded people convicted of murder 
conservatives who two years ago were highly critical of 
rehnquists leadership now have high praise 
rehnquist did not change but the courts cast did justice 
anthony m kennedy has provided a conservative vote far more 
dependably than did his predecessor lewis f powell 
justices antonin scalia byron r white and sandra day oconnor 
joined with rehnquist and kennedy in numerous key cases last term 
to relegate justices william j brennan thurgood marshall harry 
a blackmun and john paul stevens to the role of dissenters 
that 54 majority however is not rock solid 
for example the judicial philosophy of rehnquist and oconnor 
driven largely by an inclination to defer to congress and state 
legislatures at times has been at odds with scalias 
takenoprisoners libertarian brand of conservatism 
rehnquist is doing a pretty good job but he might not have a 
dependable operative conservative majority in place for a few more 
terms says patrick mcguigan of the conservative free congress 
foundation 
conservatives are buoyed by the comparative youthfulness of the 
courts new majority rehnquist turned 65 on sunday white is 72 
and scalia oconnor and kennedy are in their 50s 
brennan the courts leading liberal is also its oldest 
justice hes 83 marshall and blackmun are 81 and stevens is 69 
we have to face the fact that sooner or later justice brennan 
is not going to be there fighting the brilliant rearguard action 
he has fought for so long says kamisar if anything the 
conservative movement could accelerate 
in the new term the early best bets for conservative victories 
appear to be states gaining even more power to limit access to 
abortions and a curtailment of the federal judiciarys power in 
civil rights enforcement 
the justices have under study attempts by three states ohio 
minnesota and illinois to regulate abortions more stringently 
than allowed explicitly in the courts 1973 roe vs wade decision 
that legalized abortion and subsequent rulings 
the court also is to decide whether federal judges exceeded 
their authority when ordering a kansas city school district to 
increase property taxes to help pay for racial desegregation and 
when fining four yonkers ny city council members for failing to 
carry out a previously agreedto housing desegregation plan 
in a very distinct sense these are solemn and indeed somber 
times for those interested in pressing and advancing basic civil 
rights blackmun told a chicago lawyers group last month 
the justice said the rehnquist courts fivemember majority 
apparently will vote as a group in cases of this kind and may 
well have control of the court in the long years ahead

china celebrated its 40th anniversary sunday with 
a spectacular fireworks show above tiananmen square and tight 
security to prevent protests reminiscent of the crushed 
prodemocracy movement 
senior leader deng xiaoping 85 headed the dignitaries who 
watched the show which included several hundred thousand dancers 
from the rostrum of tiananmen gate 
it was on that rostrum on oct 1 1949 that mao tsetung 
declared the founding of the peoples republic of china the 
worlds most populous communist state 
the square occupied by thousands of students and their 
supporters during the sevenweek prodemocracy movement the 
military crushed in june was again filled with youths but this 
time they were party followers 
a 26foottall statue depicting a worker peasant intellectual 
and soldier was displayed at the north end of the square on the 
same spot where the student protesters erected their goddess of 
democracy a torchbearing woman based on the statue of liberty 
the square was bathed in spotlights neon signs that said 
19491989 and long live the motherland and a fireworks 
show that lasted more than three hours 
there also were dance shows and fireworks at eight other 
locations in beijing 
but the narrow streets around tiananmen were deserted as police 
and soldiers set up roadblocks to keep out all except local 
residents and those with passes to the square 
it has been under military guard since soldiers backed by tanks 
marched on beijing june 34 and drove the students from the square 
hundreds perhaps thousands of people died in the violence 
thousands of police and soldiers patrolled the city sunday in 
jeeps on bicycle and on foot some were in riot gear and many were 
armed with automatic rifle and electric prods 
joining deng on the rostrum in tiananmen were communist party 
general secretary jiang zemin premier li peng and 84yearold chen 
yun an ideological conservative who is rarely seen in public 
because of his frail health but who is believed to retain influence 
over major party decisions 
china invited few foreign dignitaries to the 40th anniversary 
celebrations the ambassadors of all the western countries and 
japan boycotted the tiananmen gala to demonstrate their continued 
disapproval of chinas suppression of dissent 
the top foreign leaders on the rostrum were cambodian resistance 
leader prince sihanouk east german politburo member egon krenz and 
representatives from countries including the soviet union 
pakistan cuba burundi comoros north korea kenya and 
czechoslovakia 
one american known to be on the rostrum was former secretary of 
state alexander haig in beijing as a private citizen attending a 
business symposium as part of the opening ceremonies the 
announcer said celebrate the 40 years of communist china 
celebrate the quelling of the turmoil and the counterrevolutionary 
rebellion 
the government says the prodemocracy movement was aimed at 
overthrowing the socialist system and the communist party 
the official xinhua news agency quoted deng as saying the 
movement was bad but in the final analysis it is beneficial to 
us because it made us more soberminded 
when deng took power in the late 1970s he set the nation on a 
course of economic reforms based on market principles 
but the aging revolutionary remains deeply conservative on 
social and political issues and he has cracked down every time 
political dissent has threatened to get out of hand

one of the first cases to be argued before the 
supreme court in the new term centers on whether a federal judge 
acted within his authority by fining and threatening to jail four 
city councilmen who defied his desegregation order 
the yonkers ny councilmen maintain that the judge tried to 
intimidate them into voting for a plan they opposed thereby 
violating their legislative immunity or the right to vote as they 
choose without fear of punishment by the courts 
the federal government maintains the councilmen were in contempt 
of a court order and that legislative immunity is not a license to 
disobey the law 
the case to be argued monday is an outgrowth of an 
acrimonious nineyear battle in which the federal government has 
been trying to induce yonkers the states fourthlargest city 
just north of new york city to build lowincome housing in white 
neighborhoods the housing has not yet been built as city leaders 
argue over sites and money 
the original case was filed by the justice department in 1980 
five years later us district judge leonard sand found yonkers 
had for 40 years deliberately concentrated virtually all its 
subsidized housing in the southwest quadrant to keep blacks 
separate from whites sand ordered the city to build 200 units of 
public housing in white neighborhoods in 1988 and to plan for 600 
more 
but the city defaulted and unsuccessfully appealed sand then 
ordered yonkers to adopt a package of financial incentives designed 
to attract the low and moderateincome housing or face fines 
starting at 100 a day and doubling each day until they reached 1 
million daily 
in august 1988 the council voted 43 against the package the 
four dissident councilmen nicholas v longo edward j fagan jr 
peter chema and vice mayor henry spallone were held in contempt 
fined 500 a day and threatened with jail for refusing to vote for 
desegregation plan 
facing bankruptcy yonkers prepared to lay off hundreds of 
employees and asked the supreme court to overturn the fines the 
court refused and yonkers paid 819000 before chema and longo 
switched their votes and the plan passed 52 
each councilman paid 3500 in fines spallone and fagan 
remained defiant but their punishment has been stayed pending 
appeal 
in asking the supreme court to hear spallones case his lawyers 
argued the lower courts had done violence to the doctrine of 
legislative immunity 
whether one agrees or disagrees with any legislators apparent 
political agenda tactics or motive the doctrine must remain 
inviolate they wrote inquiry into motives for legislative 
action is precisely one of the evils which the doctrine seeks to 
prevent 
but the united states in its brief argued that the city 
government had already agreed to the desegregation order when the 
councilmen voted against the plan 
the supreme court has never considered the common law 
doctrine of legislative immunity as a license to disobey federal 
court orders the government argued

the metropolitan operas first performance of 
la boheme this season had just one thing going for it but that 
turned out to be a lot 
richard leech a young american tenor of outstanding promise 
made his debut saturday afternoon in the role of rodolfo the 
bohemian writer whose love affair with the fatally ill mimi forms 
the slender plot of puccinis masterpiece 
leech justified the excitement he has stirred in chicago berlin 
and other operatic centers though only 32 he used his warm 
mediumsize voice with the ease and grace of a veteran and he came 
closer to looking the part than most tenors the met engages the 
audience gave him a standing ovation at the final curtain 
the rest of the performance wasnt much to cheer about 
as mimi the koreanborn soprano heikyung hong was a bit out of 
her league her lovely but small voice unable to bloom and soar 
over the orchestra at climactic moments soprano sona ghazarians 
rough tones failed to captivate during her big moment musettas 
waltz song baritone brian schexnayder was a stalwart but 
smallscale marcello the heros best friend 
conductor donato renzetti also making his met debut gave an 
account of the score that was more plodding than impassioned one 
of puccinis most ingenious touches is the way he swiftly brings 
the curtain down after mimi dies on saturday the final measures 
seemed to last forever 
as much a problem as ever were the gargantuan sets by franco 
zeffirelli which often make it hard for the singers to be heard or 
noticed what should be a warm intimate attic setting for the 
first and fourth acts is turned into a parisian skyline with the 
garret pushed back behind rooftops and chimneys the splitlevel 
set for the secondact cafe scene is so elaborate and has so many 
people milling about that its hard to concentrate on the action 
zeffirelli has created similarly bloated spectacles in recent 
seasons for two other puccini operas in turandot the glitz 
seemed to fit the grandiose music and action but in tosca the 
love story was again pushed aside to make room for stage gimmickry 
two of this seasons five new productions verdis la 
traviata and mozarts don giovanni have been put in his 
hands apparently on the theory that zeffirelli sets will bring in 
an audience even if the singing and conducting wont

after 74 years under south african 
rule namibians are engaged in an electoral freeforall for the 
right to lead the territory into independence 
in voting set for nov 711 namibia has the opportunity to 
transform itself from africas last colony into one of the 
continents most politically diverse and democratic nations 
the campaign has been marked by violence and intimidation but 
it also is a rarity in africa a multiparty competition where the 
outcome is in doubt there are 10 parties that include leftists 
rightists allwhite parties allblack parties and multiracial 
parties 
i think all sides are optimistic that we are going to have 
fair elections as planned said fred eckhard an american who is 
chief spokesman for the un contingent monitoring namibias 
independence process 
the frontrunner is the southwest africa peoples organization 
the blackdominated independence movement that waged a 23year war 
against south african rule 
namibians will vote for a 72member constituent assembly with 
members chosen in proportion to the number of votes their party 
receives if swapo wins at least twothirds of the vote it can 
write and implement a constitution by itself 
however details about swapos imprisonment and torture of 
hundreds of its own members in neighboring angola have damaged its 
reputation at home and abroad former detainees say hundreds are 
still being held or have been killed a charge the organization 
denies 
in the absence of reliable election surveys in the vast 
sparsely populated territory it is unclear whether the 
leftistleaning organization will capture twothirds of the vote 
or even a simple majority 
swapos popularity was evident sept 24 when its president sam 
nujoma attended his first rally after returning from 30 years in 
exile 70000 people showed up at a sports stadium in windhoek a 
city of about 100000 
no other party can draw such massive crowds but several 
regularly attract audiences in the thousands for peaceful 
wellorganized rallies 
singing and slogan chanting are more common at such events than 
talk about how to balance the budget or run a civil service 
there are repeated charges of intimidation however mostly 
between swapo and its leading rival the democratic turnhalle 
alliance a moderate multiracial coalition that favors a 
capitalist economy 
in the past most cases of intimidation were attributed to the 
police said john rwambuya head of the un operation in the 
northern town of oshakati but as the campaign begins to heat up 
there is interparty conflict and confrontation 
eckhard says the united nations receives five to 10 complaints 
daily about harassment swapo says its leaders including nujoma 
have received anonymous death threats over the telephone as well 
as in posters and graffiti that have appeared around windhoek the 
capital 
anton lubowski the only ranking white member of swapo was 
assassinated outside his windhoek home sept 12 two days before 
nujoma returned 
the vice president of the democratic turnhalle alliance mishake 
muyongo says swapo backers have beaten alliance supporters and 
stoned their cars 
in katutura the main black neighborhood on the edge of 
windhoek the offices of all political parties are surrounded by 
fences with barbed wire on top 
all of the parties have agreed that their members will not carry 
weapons 
ironically the only armed protection available to swapo is the 
namibian police who were heavily involved in the war against the 
guerrilla movement swapo says it has reluctantly requested police 
protection for its leaders 
despite such problems the campaign has proceeded relatively 
smoothly a feat considering that the bush war raged in the 
northern part of the territory as recently as april 
almost 700000 of namibias estimated 13 million people 
registered to vote a figure that exceeded the expectations of 
electoral officials 
i admit im a bit surprised muyongo said i thought the 
tension would be higher its clear the namibian people want peace 
and they cant wait any longer 
but it remains to be seen whether namibia can maintain a 
democratic tradition after independence 
several african nations reached independence as multiparty 
states but only a handful of the continents 50 governments 
currently tolerate opposition parties and hold open elections 
nujoma said sept 24 that his organization has no intention of 
imposing a oneparty political system on the namibian people 
against their will and he invited the territorys 75000 whites 
to join in building a new nation 
south africa agreed to grant independence to namibia last year 
under a regional treaty that also calls for the withdrawal of 
50000 cuban soldiers from marxistruled angola

a governing party candidate won a seat in 
parliaments upper chamber sunday in the partys first electoral 
test since the opposition won control of the house in general 
elections in july 
sundays election also was the first for the administration of 
new prime minister toshiki kaifu and was regarded as an indication 
of public sentiment as japan prepares for elections for the more 
powerful lower house 
itsuo nomura an attorney and local assembly member from the 
governing liberal democratic party received 467643 votes or 51 
percent 
socialist candidate shizue hosogane had 394123 votes or 43 
percent communist candidate setsuo yamada received 52642 or 57 
percent 
the election was to fill the vacancy left by the death in august 
of liberal democratic party legislator niro iwakami 
no words can express my feelings now nomura said in a 
televised interview as he celebrated his victory in ibaraki 65 
miles northeast of tokyo i feel a great responsibility 
the socialists had campaigned primarily on a platform of 
abolishing an unpopular sales tax the liberal democrats pushed 
through late last year 
the 3 percent tax part of a sweeping change that included 
income tax cuts is widely opposed by merchants and lower and 
middleincome consumers 
a bill to abolish it was submitted in the oppositiondominated 
upper house last week the liberal democrats now are working out a 
compromise tax revision in an effort to deflect criticism 
this is a victory for the new kaifu cabinet and shows the 
peoples faith and understanding of our plans for tax revision 
chief cabinet secretary ichiro ozawa the main government 
spokesman said at a news conference 
ms hosogane the socialist candidate told reporters the 
liberal democrats stressed it would revise the tax and the 
people seemed to accept that even though the government has not 
made clear in any way how it will go about it 
socialist party secretary general tsuruo yamaguchi said on 
television the election was a question of either abolishing the 
tax or maintaining it we werent able to get that message across 
adequately to the people of ibaraki 
the socialists also had hoped that ms hosogane a schoolteacher 
and a political novice would attract voters who are tired of 
veteran politicians and who want to see parliament invigorated by 
fresh faces 
rocked by money and sex scandals and outrage over the tax the 
liberal democrats lost their majority in the upper house in july 
for the first time since the party was formed in 1955 
the party retains its majority in the lower house and has been 
trying to restore its popularity before the next lower house 
elections possibly in january the elections must be held before 
july 1990

a senate panel is delaying confirmation of 
president bushs nominee to head the urban mass transportation 
administration while it investigates work done by his auditing firm 
the senate banking housing and urban affairs committee is 
examining the relationship between nominee brian clymers suburban 
philadelphia accounting firm and an economic development 
organization nearby according to senate aides 
the organization the delaware county partnership for economic 
development is the subject of a broad audit by the department of 
housing and urban development hud inspector general paul adams 
said in an interview friday 
the senate panel unanimously backed clymers nomination on sept 
8 but has since put a hold on sending it for a vote for the 
full house 
the local partnership which has received thousands of dollars 
in hud grants was founded in 1983 by us rep curt weldon rpa 
who has said he is not involved in its daily affairs the 
congressman ordered a consultant to investigate the partnership 
earlier this year when it was disclosed that several of weldons 
campaign supporters had received nobid contracts 
of particular interest to the senate panel are nobid contracts 
reportedly awarded to clymers firm by the partnership to audit its 
books 
clymer has been weldons campaign treasurer in the last three 
elections 
anthony j dunleavy the consultant retained at weldons 
request said that this years contract given clymers firm was 
properly bid however the philadelphia inquirer reported that 
dunleavy said that previous years contracts with clymers firm 
were not awarded through competitive procurement policies required 
by the federal government the newspaper said federal money was 
used 
dunleavy also said the partnership misspent 125000 in federal 
funds on ineligible items such as a promotion film and advertising 
william tancredi a top official of the partnership resigned in 
july after coming under fire for his handling of the organizations 
finances 
adams the inspector general said hud was conducting a general 
audit of the partnership that was not limited in any way shape 
or form 
hud was doing another audit in delaware county when a 
combination of things occurred concurrently that convinced it of 
the need to look into the partnership adams said he declined to 
be more specific 
clymer 42 is the former vice chairman of the southeastern 
pennsylvania transportation authority umta assists state and local 
governments in improving mass transportation systems he has 
declined requests to be interviewed about the matter

prostitutes continue working harry hines boulevard 
in an industrial section of dallas even as the city prepares to 
defend before the us supreme court its efforts to slow down or 
least regulate the sex trade 
the high court will hear arguments wednesday on whether the city 
can enforce portions of an ordinance that is aimed at adult 
bookstores clubs and motels 
there ordinance which took effect in june seeks to regulate 
the sex trade chiefly through zoning and a licensing requirement 
for business operators as well as lesser provisions such as a 
requirement that motel rooms be rented for at least a 10hour 
period 
the supreme court has upheld the citys zoning regulations and 
will debate only the licensing requirement which calls for 
background checks on the owners of sexually oriented businesses 
owners convicted of certain crimes including two violations of the 
states obscenity laws can be refused a license or lose a license 
already granted 
the appeal filed by 14 businesses argue that constitutes prior 
restraint 
they are also challenging a provision giving the police chief 
sole discretion in issuing licenses saying that power is too broad 
the police chief in effect becomes a master censor for the 
community without any guidance in the ordinance itself said 
arthur schwartz attorney for the owners 
the businesses say the licensing requirements violate their free 
speech rights its tantamount to destroying the presses of a 
newspaper for straying over the line in libel cases said 
schwartz 
the zoning sections forbid sexually oriented businesses from 
operating within 1000 feet of each other or within 1000 feet of 
a church park school residential area or historic district 
the city is planning to ask a state court for orders to shut 
down 60 businesses which do not meet the code vice detective steve 
foster said 
businesses can get an exemption if they prove that their 
businesses do not contribute to crime or damage property values 
so far eight of 35 exemption requests have been granted those 
who did not win exemptions had to shut down move or change their 
operations to fall outside of the ordinance 
one prostitute who works the street during the day says she can 
make between 500 and 1000 a day but rarely works in the motels 
that dot the strip anymore because they have begun enforcing the 
part of the ordinance that requires motel rooms to be rented for 10 
hours or longer 
the motels make you pay for all night she said 
some adult bars skirt the zoning provisions by changing their 
dancers costumes this was the case with genos southern belles 
which was denied an exemption because the topless bar was less than 
1000 feet from an apartment complex 
manager marty akeman said the clubs dancers donned pasties and 
bikini bottoms which took the club out of the legal definition of 
a sexually oriented business and brought it under codes governing 
dance halls and live entertainment 
pasties and bikini bottoms are also the norm at the bare facts 
a lounge a few block south of genos bartender dorothy burrus 
belittles the regulations saying you can see more on the 
beach 
one bare facts customer who identified himself only as larry 
bristled at the laws ability to close down existing businesses 
its like people who move near an airport and then complain 
about the noise he said 
but he acknowledged i wouldnt want this in my neighborhood 
john taylor has watched the action from his star tire store for 
4 years its not as bad now as it was he says but he thinks 
increased police enforcement not the ordinance is responsible 
they prostitutes used to be so thick out there that id have 
to stop and wait to get into my parking lot he said now its 
not so bad youll have two or three

secretary of education lauro f cavazos 
praised parental choice sunday as the cornerstone to rebuilding 
americas schools but said some restrictions on student transfers 
may be necessary to prevent segregation 
cavazos in an interview on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley also defended his 13month tenure and said that he has 
been pushing all along the same school reform ideas that president 
bush and the governors agreed upon at last weeks summit in 
charlottesville va 
the summit ended thursday with unanimous support for efforts to 
give parents more say in choosing which public school their child 
attends instead of assigning them strictly by neighborhood lines 
parental choice of schools is vital its the cornerstone for 
restructuring american education said cavazos 
asked about the possibility of choice leading to segregation 
cavazos said you have to be very conscious about that and be 
careful about that 
you have to put into place then guidelines that will prohibit 
students from transferring if that were to occur added cavazos 
who said minnesota and arkansas have not have such problems with 
their statewide choice plans 
cavazos asked about a newsweek report that bush was 
dissatisfied with his performance said the president has not 
discussed that with him 
many of the things were talking about now restructuring 
choice setting national goals all of those things are things 
that weve been advocating for over a year but somehow people just 
havent been listening and paying attention said the former 
texas tech university president who became the first hispanic 
cabinet official ever when appointed by thenpresident reagan last 
year 
arkansas gov bill clinton also interviewed on abc predicted 
the national performance goals bush and the governors agreed to 
forge will include reducing the dropout rate from 25 percent to 10 
percent and moving from the bottom on international math and 
science tests to the top two or three countries over 10 years 
clinton said that while more money is needed to help get poor 
children physically and mentally fit to begin school the main 
challenge is to restructure american schools and reallocate 
existing resources 
theres not a lot more money from the federal government we 
need if its sharply clearly focused clinton said 
new jersey gov thomas kean said theres also a problem about 
what happens to the children after they get into the school there 
are a tremendous number of schools who warehouse children simply 
instead of teaching them who practice what i call educational 
child abuse in the cities 
kean said drug czar william bennett was simply wrong in 
characterizing some discussions at the education summit as pap 
we started with a small group of governors who were concerned 
with education seven or eight years ago we now have 50 education 
governors committed to it we have a president of the united states 
whos willing to take the lead and say this is our most important 
subject facing the country said kean 
clinton said bennett has had a lot of good ideas over the 
years and he had a bad day that day i wish hed never said it it 
was a great conference we set national performance goals for the 
first time in the history of the country and the schools are going 
to be better

kathy troughton didnt hit bottom 
until she saw a national guardsman holding a rifle at her 
neighborhood grocery store five days after hurricane hugo hit 
then she began to cry 
that meant that we were really in trouble she said 
restricted to cold showers and limited lighting for more than a 
week until they got their power back saturday night the family of 
ben and kathy troughton is like thousands of families coming to 
terms with the destruction hurricane hugo brought when it raged 
ashore with 135 mph winds sept 21 
the troughtons are better off than many while an estimated 
50000 residents in the charleston area are still listed as 
displaced persons the troughtons have stayed in their home a 
woodframe splitlevel in this suburb across the harbor 
troughtons job with a car rental agency was not washed away 
during the more than a week they were without electricity a 
generator powered a television and small lamp and relatives 
brought in spaghetti fried chicken and gas to cook with 
on sunday with power restored troughton said they almost 
feel livable again 
but the rhythm of their lives changed days are filled with 
removing trees and scrubbing house nights with uneasy sleep 
the troughtons both 36 and their oldest son scott 15 are 
coping two younger boys were sent to relatives in georgia until 
some normalcy returned troughton said sunday they should be home 
in a day or so 
the storm began its destructive trip up the east coast about two 
miles from the troughtons home when it ripped through sullivans 
island and the isle of palms 
the family delayed departing until too late in part over 
concern for their english bulldog who wouldnt be allowed in an 
emergency shelter 
by the time the eye of the storm passed around midnight they 
knew they had made a mistake 
i thought how foolish i was to have stayed with three kids 
through that i was really angry with myself mrs troughton said 
though the family lost 11 tall pines including four that 
demolished their station wagon hugo left only a leaky roof and a 
torn corner on the house 
i feel very lucky very very lucky scott said 
the first day after the storm was spent on the telephone with 
family and friends checking on their safety 
with power gone since the previous evening food was in danger 
of spoiling mrs troughton used the barbecue grill and about 50 
hamburgers were cooked up and sent to neighbors 
nightfall brought an eerie sense of danger as a 7 pm curfew 
and no electricity turned the neighborhood into a tomb 
at night around here its almost scary she said at 
night there are so few cars moving that when one does its like 
whats going on its almost like being in a war zone 
they received their first shipment of supplies from relatives 
saturday two days after hugo hit food and butane gas to set up 
the stove in the garage by then they were also housing four 
friends to help remove trees and another waiting to return to his 
home on the isle of palms 
on sunday mrs troughton realized she missed going to church 
only when she saw a neighbor heading that way im still confused 
about what day it is she said a week after the storm 
sunday brought more supplies from relatives as well as a painful 
decision the two younger boys would be safer away from home 
my 3yearold was turning on the butane tank my 
11yearold was out there with an ax cutting down trees she said 
monday brought soaking rains that drove everyone inside to 
powerless homes making residents increasingly claustrophobic 
you just feel so closed up in here she said 
some respite came when men from the neighborhood gathered in 
someones garage to watch monday night football on a 
generatorpowered television 
people are living in the garages troughton said theyre 
sitting and talking in the garage theyre drinking in the garage 
theyre playing cards in the garage theyre swapping lies in the 
garage 
their physical possessions safe the troughtons counted their 
losses in convenience togetherness and emotional security 
you walk around and you try to smile and help and all she 
said and then you say forget it im sick of being nice about 
this hurricane im tired of being nice to people no you 
cant have my eggs no you cant have my gas 
the feeling lasted until wednesday when she committed herself 
to scrubbing the cakedon mud from the kitchen floor and sneaked 
into an apartment house laundry room to wash clothes scott got a 
chance to see his friends when the high school football team 
resumed practice and the next day troughton returned to his job 
the old routine is still not back 
i think probably its going to be like somebodys ill you 
might cruise through it pretty good but then six months later 
you will think back and think how terrible it was she said 
in my wildest dreams i could not imagine a hurricane doing 
this

by day bricola colemans neighborhood in 
northwest atlanta looks like any middleclass area with its neat 
yards brick apartment complexes churches small shops and trees 
by night it is a druginfested warren of pushers hookers 
drunks and overworked police whose arrival is met by a cacophony 
of voices shouting twelve twelve a street slang signal from 
lookouts that the police are coming 
but it was by day not night that 12yearold bricola was 
murdered 
fear of retaliation and a conspiracy of silence have hobbled the 
push to find her killer but police say they are sure somebody saw 
something 
to those who knew her bricola represented the daylight side of 
northwestern atlanta a bright imaginative deeply religious 
seventhgrader who studied hard stayed out of trouble and dreamed 
of a career as an actress or dancer 
on sept 12 she arrived home from school and telephoned her 
mother at her job she took the familys clothes to the laundry 
room two buildings away and returned to the apartment 
when della belle coleman arrived home she found her daughter on 
the kitchen floor strangled with a jump rope badly beaten on the 
head and sexually assaulted with a broomstick 
bricola had often said mamma weve got to move mrs 
coleman recalled later 
now neighborhood utility poles carry offers of a 10000 reward 
and a promise of anonymity for anyone with information leading to 
the killer 
lt pt umphress the night supervisor of the zone where the 
killing occurred said the murder appears to be one of opportunity 
not directly tied to drugs but likely done by elements brought to 
the projects by the drug trade 
the dealers attract all sorts of thugs he said 
he described the area as basically stable mrs coleman has 
lived in her subsidized threebedroom apartment 10 years but 
flooded in the past three years or so by crack dealers crime he 
estimated jumped tenfold 
people in these buildings came to terms with the dope dealers 
years ago policeman larry richardson said they even got used 
to the doperelated killings but a sweet innocent little girl 
like that they wont put up with it mothers especially are 
talking and they dont care who knows it or sees them 
a group of more than 100 volunteer civilians organized by state 
sen arthur langford has gone doortodoor seeking anybody who saw 
anything 
people who will not talk to the police will talk to people 
they trust they know the history of our organization langford 
said a lot of addicts wont share information with the police 
but they will share it with us 
he said his group the united youth adult conference which has 
done similar canvassing in other cases including the atlanta child 
killings of the 1970s and 1980s has turned considerable 
information over to police 
but there is no sign so far that the right person is talking 
ill stake my badge that somebody knows and they arent 
talking said lt horace walker who heads the homicide unit 
one recent day richardson drove through the neighborhood 
at one apartment complex he bantered with a confident 
goldtoothed youth whose friends scattered when the patrol car 
pulled into sight the youth gave cocky advice on how to catch drug 
dealers 
he was richardson said later a major crack supplier one of 
the big boys who never actually carries the stuff 
the ones that ran they were the ones that were holding 
drugs and the girl with him was his 16yearold girlfriend she 
knows every damn thing that goes on in these projects and she 
isnt telling any of it 
for now at least the activity following bricola colemans 
slaying has driven the pushers to other complexes nearby 
its another story a mile or so away at bankhead courts among 
the roughest in atlanta where groups of young men richardson says 
are pushers wave at passing patrol cars and fights and robberies 
are so common they often go unreported 
many buildings are boarded up some firebombed in drug wars 
you talk to the old people theyll tell you that when this 
was built it was one of the best communities ever he said 
then their children grew up

republicans are on the offensive papering the 
districts of house democrats with identically worded press releases 
accusing them of casting a vote in favor of higher taxes 
only the names were changed on the attack releases that flowed 
from the house republican campaign committee 
democrats had their own tax plan in the house one they thought 
was a politically sexy idea revival of individual retirement 
accounts 
but from the democrats there was only silence bordering on 
embarrassment after all rep beryl anthony of arkansas chairman 
of the house democratic campaign committee was one of 64 democrats 
who ended up in the republican presidents corner on the question 
of cutting taxes on capital gains 
senate majority leader george mitchell insists he has the votes 
in the senate to defeat the presidents plan but acknowledges 
there is a good chance a retooled version could pass the senate 
to say the democrats have mishandled the tax fight so far 
suggests gross understatement not only were the republicans 
positioned on the side of cutting taxes the democrats 
underestimated the appeal of that tax cut among the small business 
interests and entrepeneurs party leaders still hope vote for the 
party of franklin roosevelt 
the attempt to offer an ira revival as an alternative came 
across as a belated effort to undermine the capital gains cut and 
included a rate increase for about 600000 of the wealthiest 
taxpayers 
there were perfectly reasonable arguments against the capital 
gains proposal 
but the political bottom line was that it was a tax cut 
there were perfectly reasonable arguments in favor of nailing 
the wealthy to finance a restoration of iras 
but the political bottom line was that it was a tax increase 
it is such simplifications that provide the edge in the press 
release politics of today 
democrats still rankle at the memory of how michael dukakis 
veto on constitutional grounds of legislation to require 
teachers to lead daily recitations of the pledge of allegiance was 
used during the 1988 presidential campaign to question the 
massachusetts governors patriotism 
the flag the pollution in boston harbor the state prison 
furlough program all were issues that lent themselves to 
oversimplification and the republicans exploited them 
that ugly election is over and now democrats are champing at the 
bit in their eagerness to take on george bush 
william galston and elaine kamarck two former advisers to 1984 
democratic presidential nominee walter f mondale began a recent 
article by describing what they call their partys current 
disarray so evident in its failure to mount an effective 
opposition to the bush administration 
democratic party chairman ronald h brown told party officials 
meeting across town from the capitol that every where he travels 
democrats ask him when are you going to take the gloves off 
he took them off but as luck would have it he was denouncing 
the capital gains tax cut as a giveaway to the ultra rich 
within minutes of the house vote on which 64 democrats gave the 
president his margin of victory 
the chairman did what he had to do he called the defectors 
good democrats and said he realized they had their reasons for 
voting the way they did 
many of the members who didnt vote with the leadership 
position thought they were doing what was in the best interests of 
their constituents said the party chairman 
he recoiled at the suggestion the defectors might not be good 
democrats 
there is no litmus test in the democratic party he said 
there is no single issue on which we read people out if the 
party that would be ridiculous 
if nothing else it showed brown learned something from the 
experience eight years ago when party leaders railed at the 
southern conservatives the boll weevils who supported ronald 
reagans tax and budget cuts in 1981 
the strongest action was taken against thendemocratic rep phil 
gramm of texas gramm resigned his house seat switched parties and 
was reelected as a republican in 1984 he easily won election to 
the senate 
if the house vote on capital gains proved anything it was that 
challenging a president early in his term when he is riding high 
in the polls is a delicate business 
it requires a careful choice of issues and a willingness to 
absorb a few defeats 
right now the republicans are sending out the press releases and 
hoping to put the democrats on the defensive the odds are the 
democrats will have their opportunities to crow and the reality is 
that bush has yet to be tested

will find those his own age 
like other kids igor loves apple juice and gum and bananas and 
ice cream she said and like other kids he reveled in the 
surprise birthday party his new friends in rochester had when he 
turned 7 recently 
igor is taking drugs to shrink the tumor from its tennisball 
dimensions to a size that doctors hope will allow surgical removal 
in about three months 
the benign but still dangerous tumor at the base of his brain 
as well as his unusual size are caused by an overproduction of 
growth hormone by the pituitary gland 
igor seemed normal at birth according to the family but by six 
months he was the size of a 1yearold at one year he was 
equivalent to a 3yearold 
when doctors in kiev and moscow had no treatment igors mother 
wrote to the red cross in switzerland which advised her to write 
to doctors and hospitals in countries such as england and the 
united states 
there were times she thought it was the end of the world 
said sahulenko who is staying with the ladans in special housing 
for children undergoing treatment at the clinic 
but letter followed letter inquiry after inquiry 
she is a mother said sahulenko what else could she do 
the glasnostera easing of travel and other restrictions on 
soviet citizens also helped she said otherwise hed never be 
here 
the family eventually was referred to the mayo clinic and dr 
donald zimmerman a pediatric endocrinologist they now call the 
miracle doctor 
because the family lacks money and insurance zimmerman asked 
the clinic to absorb the costs of igors care and a pharmaceutical 
house agreed to donate medicine 
people have been so good since the moment she stepped from the 
airplane sahulenko said that is something wonderful in 
america 
after the operation radiation and followup drug therapy should 
complete the removal of the tumor and stop the excess production of 
growth hormone a mayo clinic spokeswoman said sunday 
zimmerman said last week that the boys overall health is good 
although there is concern the tumor could press on the optic nerves 
and interfere with his vision 
even without a tumor he said people with excess growth hormone 
can develop problems such as nerve and muscle disease degenerative 
arthritis and enlarged heart muscles and sometimes have tremendous 
psychological and social problems because of their size

senate majority leader george mitchell said 
sunday he has the votes to defeat the housepassed version of 
president bushs capital gains tax cut a measure he likened to 
crack cocaine 
however mitchell acknowledged that a revised version might have 
enough support to win narrow approval because bushs 
irresponsible position makes it extremely difficult to 
prevent any tax cut from occurring 
interviewed on nbctvs meet the press the maine democrat 
said he is positive the 27month capital gains tax cut approved by 
the house last week will not be enacted by the senate 
it is so bad so wrong for the economy he said it will 
do for the deficit what crack does for the user a quick short high 
followed by a long painful depression 
the measure would reduce from 33 percent to 196 percent the 
maximum tax rate on profits from the sale of stocks and other 
investments until 1992 the rate then would climb back to 28 
percent with assets indexed so that any gains attributed to 
inflation after that point would not be taxed 
its attractiveness to lawmakers stems from predictions by 
economists that a selloff by investors rushing to cash in on the 
lowrate window would generate 94 billion in additional tax 
revenue over the next three years 
after then however the revenues would fall dramatically and 
actually worsen the deficit by a total of 21 billion over the 
following five years according to congress joint committee on 
taxation 
im confident that this socalled yoyo on two years off 
two years and the way in which its constructed cannot pass 
mitchell said theres a growing realization that it will be bad 
for the economy and will do nothing for the future of this 
country 
while saying he personally opposes any cut in capital gains 
taxes now mitchell acknowledged that many members of his party 
favor enacting a differential that would tax capital gains at a 
lower rate than wages interest or dividend income 
whether or not they will coalesce behind any plan along with 
republicans i dont know he said it will be very close on 
some other plan 
a majority of senate democrats have united behind an alternative 
plan proposed by sen lloyd bentsen dtexas to restore up to 
1000 a year of tax deductibility for contributions to individual 
retirement accounts ira deductibility ended in 1987 under the 
loopholeclosing tax law a year earlier that also raised the rate 
on capital gains 
house democratic leaders tried the same ira substitute but 
linked it to an increase in taxes on families with incomes of more 
than 145000 a year 
mitchell said senate democrats will not link their ira proposal 
to such an increase but rather will propose to make up revenue 
lost to expanded ira deductions by extending telephone and other 
excise taxes that were due to expire at the end of this year 
meanwhile house speaker thomas s foley predicted on the same 
program that the house probably will vote this week to repeal 
medicare catastrophic health care coverage that it enacted last 
year for some 33 million elderly americans 
many beneficiaries especially the wealthier among them have 
balked at having to pay premiums this year of up to 800 to help 
cover medical expenses for retirees of more modest means 
i hope personally that the program is retained on a modified 
form said foley dwash but there are a great number of 
republicans and some democrats in the house who are in favor of 
repeal if i were guessing today i think it probably would be 
repealed 
foley also said it is doubtful that congress will complete 
action on a deficitreduction bill which would include any tax 
measure before the oct 16 deadline 
that is the date broad spending cuts in both military and 
domestic programs would be triggered automatically unless congress 
comes up with 6 billion in new revenues or program cuts for 
reducing the budget deficit for fiscal year 1990 which began 
sunday 
we might have some few days in which there would be a 
technical sequestration that is an acrosstheboard cutting 
through executive order of all the accounts foley said i 
dont think thats going to be a permanent situation

new jerseys race for governor has taken a 
very nasty road with the two candidates taking turns denying their 
opponents latest allegation of wrongdoing or impropriety and then 
making one of their own 
once someone goes into the mud he drags the other candidate 
in with him said gov thomas h kean the popular republican who 
is barred from the state constitution from running for a third 
consecutive term with campaigns like this the voters lose 
the sharp volleys between seventerm democratic rep james 
florio 52 the frontrunner in recent polls and fiveterm 
republican rep james courter 47 have become more frequent and a 
televised debate last week granted both their most public forum yet 
a florio television commercial accuses courter of dumping toxic 
waste on his own property but courter says the allegation is 
just plain wrong florio in turn said a courter accusation 
that his law firm allows drug dealers back onto the street is 
slimy 
one of two gubernatorial races this year the other is in 
virginia the campaign has degenerated into an exchange of 
personal attacks that have eclipsed top issues such tax reform 
drug abuse high automobile insurance rates and abortion 
in a raging battle over ethics courter accused florio of 
obtaining a free stake in land in camden county florio said he 
took out a loan to buy an interest in the land which he eventually 
donated to his alma mater trenton state college 
florio leveled his own conflict of interest charges saying 
courters law firm represented westinghouse electric co a defense 
contractor while courter was a member of the armed services 
committee courter said his place on the committee was never 
compromised 
three independent polls released last week show florio with a 
substantial lead over courter one conducted by political media 
research poll for a group of media outlets showed florio with a 
14point lead 
results of a poll released saturday by the eagleton institute of 
rutgers university found courter trailing by 23 points a separate 
poll by the record of hackensack found the republican trailing by 
16 points 
the election is nov 7 
the race comes only a year after a notoriously dirty us senate 
campaign in new jersey which featured among other things 
unsuccessful republican challenger pete dawkins calling sen frank 
lautenberg a swamp dog 
i dont think there was ever much doubt that this 
gubernatorial race was going to become a mudslinging and 
namecalling campaign said rick sinding president of the center 
for analysis of public issues in princeton unfortunately there 
is a growing belief that negative campaigns work in the debate 
they were like two little kids kicking sand on each other 
leaders of each campaign insist their charges are accurate and 
that the other side is distorting the truth they both say they are 
waging positive campaigns but wont let their opponents 
charges go unchallenged 
a florio television advertisement saying the state was forced to 
order courter and his brother to remove drums of fuel oil from land 
they owned clearly angered courter environmental officials say the 
spill of oil was not significant but it took the courters nearly 
two years to remove the drums 
i was the victim of a midnight dumper said courter 
the clear implication in the ads is that jim courter utilized 
his land as a toxic waste dump and thats a vicious personal 
attack said republican leader robert franks an adviser to the 
courter campaign 
florio aides had similar comments about a courter ad accusing 
florio of profiting from his law firms defense of drug dealers 
florio whose forte in congress is environmental issues wants 
to counter proenvironment advertisements by courter who is rated 
by the environmental lobby in congress at the bottom of the states 
14member delegation 
courter is attempting to paint florio as soft on crime saying 
his opposition to a proposal that would loosen restrictions on 
evidence favors criminals rather than victims

west germanys ambassador opened 
his embassy sunday to 200 newly arrived east germans who missed the 
departure of the last freedom train crammed with their countrymen 
come on in all of you slowly ambassador hermann huber said 
to a jubilant crowd that spent a day waiting outside the closed 
compound i am going to take care of you temporarily 
an agreement between west germany and communist east berlin on 
saturday cleared the way for the exodus of thousands of east 
germans who had been holed up at bonns embassies in prague and 
warsaw for several weeks 
trains left prague saturday night and sunday with an estimated 
6000 refugees and another 800 left warsaw today 
east germany said the transfer was a onetime occurrence but 
refugees hearing of the exodus began flooding embasies in those 
east bloc capitals anyway in hopes of also securing safe passage to 
the west 
in prague uniformed czechoslovak police blocked the embassy and 
squad cars later were positioned in all the streets leading to the 
compound all late arrivals east germans were turned back but not 
before about 200 had gathered in front 
the crowd of latecomers most of them young some with small 
children milled about or sat in front of the embassy gate despite 
word from an employee over the intercom system that the building 
was closed for the day 
their growing desperation ended abruptly at 5 pm when the 
policemen in front of the gate moved aside and huber appeared 
later sunday the west german foreign ministry in bonn summoned 
czechoslovak ambasssador dusan spacil late sunday to formally 
protest the police presence around the prague embassy 
in a brief appearance earlier huber had urged the refugees to 
go back home 
last night was a onetime situation he said earlier of the 
exodus of thousands of east germans on trains from prague and 
warsaw to west germany the occupation of the embassy will not 
improve the situation 
however it was unclear now how bonn would respond to the second 
wave of wouldbe emigres or whether east germany would allow 
another transfer 
in warsaw dozens of east germans also waited outside the west 
german embassy including some who missed the train to the west by 
only a few minutes 
the glumlooking refugees sat in cars or milled about the 
street filling out forms for the embassy staff and wondering where 
they would spend the night 
several said they were convinced that eventually there would be 
another train for them 
the agreement between east and west germany allowing the exodus 
highlighted the dramatic political changes at work in the east bloc 
as warsaw pact nations slowly follow the lead of soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev who has initiated widespread reform in his 
own country 
the reformoriented leadership in hungary was the first to take 
up the challenge presented by the east german refugees opening its 
western border to them on sept 10 
east germany czechoslovakia and other hardline warsaw pact 
countries have been critical of hungary for opening its border 
poland was reluctant to antagonize its ally in berlin despite 
the enormous political changes in warsaw that led to the advent of 
the first east bloc government not led communists but polish 
officials did not inhibit the movement of the refugees around the 
city so they did not have to be crammed into embassy grounds 
the hardline government in prague pledged not to let east 
germans emigrate to the west through its territory but on 
saturday west german television showed czechoslovak police 
standing by idly as refugees prepared for their trip west 
more than 100000 east germans have emigrated to west germany 
this year taking advantage of a law automatically granting them 
citizenship on arrival 
among them are about 25000 who emigrated over hungarys western 
border west german border police in munich said sunday nearly 
1000 east germans arrived via austria from hungary overnight the 
highest number in recent days

britains opposition labor party began its annual 
conference sunday poised to shift the socialist movement toward the 
center and dump its votelosing doctrine of unilateral nuclear 
disarmament 
as the weeklong conference opened in brighton public opinion 
polls published sunday showed labor in its strongest position since 
it lost power to prime minister margaret thatchers conservatives 
in 1979 
the electorate now regards the labor party as electable which 
it did not in 1983 or 1987 said gerald kaufman the partys 
foreign affairs spokesman referring to labors last two general 
election defeats 
the policy overhaul endorsed last spring by the partys 
28member national executive committee is virtually assured of 
being adopted during a series of debates beginning monday because 
of committed support from leaders of major trade unions 
trade union bosses have the biggest say at labors policymaking 
conferences under a controversial system that gives them huge block 
votes based on the number of union members 
already the proposed new platform which the conservatives 
dismiss as a cosmetic exercise by an avowedly leftist party has 
helped transform labors fortunes 
in june labor trounced the conservatives in elections for the 
european parliament and has since led by 3 to 12 percentage points 
in every national opinion poll 
five polls commissioned by sunday newspapers put labor between 
five and 12 points ahead they ranged from market and opinion 
research international in the protory sunday times of london 
which put labor at 43 percent of the vote and the conservatives at 
38 percent to labors 46 percent vs the conservatives 34 percent 
in a national opinion poll sampling for another tory supporter the 
mail on sunday 
none of the three other national parties two squabbling 
centrist parties and the environmentalist green party got more 
than 10 percent 
the national opinion poll polled 989 voters on sept 25 market 
and opinion research questioned 1739 between sept 21 and 26 
neither newspaper provided the margin of error 
a key point for labor leader neil kinnock is that polls show 
support consistently topping 40 percent a share that under 
britains electoral system is usually sufficient to give a party an 
outright majority in the 650member house of commons 
after a decade of humiliation labor also has been boosted by a 
sense among many voters that thatcherism has gone too far and by 
the collapse of the center parties which in 1983 and 1987 split 
the anticonservative vote 
but labors task remains daunting 
mrs thatcher who does not have to call an election until 1992 
won last time with a huge 102seat majority 
to regain outright power labor would need to win 97 new seats 
including some conservative strongholds in britains prosperous 
south and achieve the biggest swing against a british government 
since world war ii 
polls which put labor well ahead on issues such as health 
education and welfare also show many voters doubtful about the 
socialists ability to manage the economy 
the proposed new policy package the result of a twoyear review 
kinnock ordered after the 1987 election has dismayed the partys 
vocal left wing 
it stipulates that a laborled government would give up 
britains nuclear weapons only in a negotiated arms deal 
this overturns labors pledge adopted in 1981 as the party 
lurched left after losing power to scrap britains 
submarinelaunched missiles and shut down us nuclear bases within 
five years of coming to power 
for kinnock 47 once an ardent supporter of unilateral nuclear 
disarmament it represents a major personal shift after two 
electoral defeats 
other proposed changes include dropping commitments to 
renationalize most of the stateowned industries sold off by mrs 
thatcher and retaining some of her curbs on labor unions

lebanese lawmakers clashed sunday over 
the presence of syrian troops in their country and christian leader 
gen michel aoun demanded a timetable for their pullout before 
agreeing to peace 
in beirut where aoun made his comments christian forces and 
syrianbacked druse militiamen battled for 15 minutes around the 
mountain garrison of souk algharb testing a fragile ceasefire 
no casualties were reported 
reporters are barred from the parliament sessions in taif a 
saudi arabian resort and from direct access to the lawmakers 
but sources at the meeting reported a stormy session sunday as 
the 63 members of parliament 33 christians and 30 moslems 
gathered for a second day in their bid to end the 14yearold civil 
war and address an arab league peace plan 
the session was dominated by disagreements between christians 
and moslems over what syrias role in lebanon should be said the 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
saudi host foreign minister prince saud alfaisal played down 
the discord 
we do not regard this as disturbing in any way in fact it is 
a healthy sign that all views are aired and opinions expressed 
he said 
he praised former lebanese prime minister saeb salaam for 
invoking the slogan failure is not permissible 
supporters of aoun a maronite catholic say they will not agree 
to give moslems a greater share of political power until there is a 
timetable for a pullout of the estimated 40000 syrian troops in 
lebanon 
syrian troops first entered lebanon in 1976 as part of an arab 
league peacekeeping force they initially sought to curb moslem 
factions but wound up fighting the christians and aoun says they 
have lost their mandate 
syrianbacked moslem leaders support a continuing role for syria 
to protect their position and help guarantee a settlement of 
lebanons civil war 
moslem lawmakers argued that syria should stay in lebanon until 
israel withdraws from a southern lebanese border strip it has 
occupied since 1982 israel says the strip six to 10 miles wide 
is a security zone 
iraq has been supplying weapons to the christians partly to get 
even with syria for backing iran iraqs enemy in the eightyear 
persian gulf war 
damascus has said it will not consider a withdrawal until its 
moslem allies are given an equal share of power with the 
christians who have dominated the executive army and judiciary 
since lebanon gained independence in 1943 
moslems are now believed to make up 55 percent of the poulation 
although there has been no official census since 1932 
addressing supporters in beirut on sunday aoun said we shall 
accept nothing now that we have rejected in the past because our 
demands are indivisible we have waged war to achieve peace 
our only essential goal is to liberate our land and 
reestablish sovereignty over lebanons entire territory we shall 
not compromise the blood of our martyrs auon said 
his remarks appeared to be a response to pressures on christian 
lawmakers in taif to agree to postpone discussion of syrias role 
until after the election of a new president formation of a new 
government and agreement on political reforms 
under that scenario the syrians then would begin to withdraw 
from moslem west beirut and regroup in eastern lebanons bekaa 
valley the withdrawal from the greater beirut area would be 
completed in two years according to officials in beirut 
lebanon has been without a head of state since former president 
amin gemayels sixyear term ended on sept 22 1988 
gemayel named aoun a caretaker prime minister before he left 
office but moslems rejected the appointment and said acting prime 
minister salim hoss a sunni moslem is the legitimate head of 
government

theres a mayoral election in atlanta this 
tuesday but youd be hard pressed to prove it as the quiet return 
of former mayor maynard jackson has unfolded with hardly a hitch 
jackson the citys mayor from 197482 has kept a low profile 
during the two terms of his successor andrew young but at 51 he 
remains popular so much so that his chief challenger fulton 
county commission chairman michael lomax suddenly quit the race in 
august amid dismal poll showings 
im just a nice guy jackson chuckles 
at the last minute veteran civil rights activist hosea williams 
quit his city council seat and entered the race predicting a 
miracle but also running admittedly to make jackson put up some 
kind of a fight 
ive already accomplished one of my major victories to make 
maynard campaign williams said last week if it hadnt been 
for me he would have walked back into city hall scotfree 
but williams has not gotten exactly the fight he sought the 
former mayor refused a oneonone debate even after williams tried 
to force the challenge by fasting which only left him thinner and 
weary the fast brought in one campaign contribution a new pair 
of suspenders from a backer 
with only 15000 or so in campaign donations williams has been 
forced to rely on a few radio ads to get his message out along 
with yard signs proclaiming him the cliquebuster a slap at 
jackson whom he brands part of a superrich small black 
elitist clique 
jacksons staff has concentrated on making sure their supporters 
bother to vote 
the apathy out there is much stronger than i expected 
jackson said were fighting hard for a respectable turnout 
what were fighting for is a mandate i want to make sure im 
not walking up calvary alone the more people vote the more people 
feel invested in the future of the city 
four longshots round out the nonpartisan ballot nightclub 
comedian jerry farber bus driver and antiabortion activist 
mitchell williams georgia tech student mark teal and lafayette 
perry who is unemployed 
young is ineligible for a third consecutive term as was jackson 
eight years ago when he left the mayors office for the life of a 
highpaid bond lawyer young is now mounting a race for governor in 
1990 
the quiet of the campaign is surprising considering the 
presence of the talkative growling hosea williams news reports 
barely mention the campaign focusing instead on what jacksons 
third term will be like 
jackson an erudite eloquent man became atlantas first black 
mayor in 1973 five years after he turned some heads with a 
longshot challenge to veteran sen herman talmadge 
now jackson seems headed for coronation 
even ive been surprised he said that long out of 
office when you look at our numbers 
the toughest job in politics is being a mayor every day you 
make 10 people happy and 10 people mad people want people crave 
strong leadership and thats what ive always tried to give 
in his previous terms jackson was a bold young mayor locked in 
contention with the citys largely white business community as he 
insisted on minority participation in city business other problems 
arose a 1977 garbage strike shook the city and his public safety 
commissioner quit in 1978 amid allegations that he had helped 
supporters cheat on promotion exams 
though black himself williams has been a longtime critic of the 
citys black power structure saying those blacks in power have not 
done enough for poor people he blames jackson for derailing the 
city from its history of continuous progression he charges 
that under jackson crime increased the police department was 
demoralized and hit by corruption and infrastructure needs went 
unmet 
but jacksons eight years in office the opening of the citys 
rapid transit system and the construction of a huge new airport 
complex 
this time out he is courting white business support even 
though he probably doesnt need it to win in a city where 61 
percent of the 192000 registered voters are black 
jacksons priorities this time are the problems of atlanta and 
numerous other cities drugfueled crime and a need for lowincome 
housing 
jackson calls his platform five for the future fighting 
drugs and crime building better housing promoting economic 
development wellmanaged government and improving the quality of 
life 
that is not the agenda of a bond attorney 
i love the law he said i love the practice of law but 
the reality is that politics is my ministry i want to do something 
to make a difference the only thing i have in mind is serving this 
city as mayor 
were going to show ourselves and the nation how great a 
city can be

runcie issued the statement hours after three protestant 
clergymen interrupted his sunday sermon by shouting that his 
fourday visit to the vatican was a betrayal 
runcie who as archbishop of canterbury is spiritual head of the 
state church of england and leader of the worlds 70 million 
anglicans is making his first official trip to the vatican as part 
of a quest to someday bring the churches together 
he said in his statement that some people had charged his 
suggestion to give the pope some sort of primacy among christians 
subverts the british constitution 
this is not the case said the statement the phrase 
universal primacy has a spiritual meaning it does not imply 
political supremacy and does not suggest that the pope should 
administer the affairs of the church of england 
the anglican church split from the roman catholic church in the 
16th century over the popes refusal to annul king henry viiis 
marriage to catherine of aragon the queen of england is considered 
the temporal head of the church of england 
when people try to suggest the whole british constitution is 
being subverted its just someone trying to make a story or stir 
things up the rev canon christopher hill secretary for 
ecumenical affairs to the archbishop told reporters 
neither hill nor the statement said who was doing the 
criticizing but the rev ian paisley delivered a protest to 
runcies spokeswoman saturday accusing the anglican leader of 
high treason 
paisley a northern ireland protestant leader also assailed 
runcie for attending a papal mass in rome on sunday he was the 
second archbishop of canterbury to do so since the reformation 
paisley is head of the free presbyterian church in northern 
ireland which is vehemently anticatholic 
three of paisleys associates disrupted an anglican church 
service attended by vatican officials on sunday 
as runcie was about to begin his sermon at all saints anglican 
church the three clergymen jumped up and peeled off their jackets 
revealing tshirts emblazoned runcie is a traitor to protestant 
britain and remember cranmer 
your presence here is a betrayal shouted one of the 
clergymen 
remember cranmer remember his death cried another thomas 
cranmer was the first archbishop of canterbury of the reformed 
church of england and was burned at the stake by catholic 
authorities in 1556 for promoting protestantism 
ushers hustled the protesters away and police checked their 
passports but no arrests were made runcie showed no emotion at 
the interruption 
the protesters identified themselves as the rev david cassells 
of glasgow scotland the rev brian green of london and the rev 
david larner of london all officers of the british council of 
protestant christian churches 
paisley said he did not join the protest because security guards 
would not have allowed him into the church 
runcie attended an outdoor mass in st peters square sunday 
during which pope john paul ii beatified 29 people beatification 
is a step toward possible sainthood 
runcie was the first archbishop of canterbury to attend a papal 
mass in rome since archbishop donald coggan went to the popes 
inauguration in 1978 
john paul greeted runcie during the ceremony in which catholics 
wish each other peace he did not address the subject of 
catholicanglican unity during the mass 
in 1960 the late geoffrey fisher became the first archbishop of 
canterbury to visit the vatican since the reformation 
in his sermon sunday runcie called again for greater unity 
between anglicans and the worlds 850 million catholics noting 
they already shared many beliefs 
but despite progress in unity talks in recent years anglicans 
and catholics are still divided over issues ranging from birth 
control to the meaning of the eucharist

an estimated 100000 people gathered 
in this montenegrin city sunday to pay homage to the regions last 
monarch at a ceremonial reburial 73 years after his exile 
the state funeral for king nikola petrovicnjegos and queen 
milena was the first official recognition by communist yugoslavia 
of the countrys royal past 
their remains were brought back to his homeland from italy 
saturday and the reburial ceremony included pageantry unseen in 
this former tiny balkan kingdom since his coronation 
an openair liturgy at cetinjes monastery was followed by a 
colorful procession of orthodox roman catholic and moslem clergy 
through the citys streets 
a ceremonial unit of the former montenegrin navy clad in 
traditional 17th century uniforms carried the kings saber and his 
many medals and marched along with montenegrins in colorful 
national costume 
nikola ruled montenegro now the smallest of yugoslavias six 
republics from 1860 to 1916 when he was forced into exile by 
advancing austrohungarian troops 
he died in exile in 1921 and his mountain domain was 
incorporated into the newly established south slav kingdom by his 
nephew serbian monarch aleksandar karadjordjevic 
the nationally televised burial ceremony provided the first 
chance for many yugoslavs to see members of the karadjordjevic 
family which reigned until a communist state was established in 
1945 
tens of thousands lined cetinjes streets and crowded balconies 
and windows to see the cortege pulled by six black horses bearing 
the coffins of the royal couple and their two daughters 
the gun carriage was followed by nikolas relatives three 
princesses of the exiled karqdjordjevic dynasty other european 
aristrocrats in the procession included prince vitorrio emanuele di 
savoia of italy prince dimitri romanov of russia and crown prince 
idriz senussi of libya 
montenegros president branko kostic and other state officials 
also attended in what appeared to be an effort by the regions new 
communist leadership to dissociate itself from its predecessors 
the latest hardliners were swept out of office in a wave of 
popular unrest in january 
the reburial of the royal family in their homeland has long 
been put off under the excuse that the appropriate times have still 
not come kostic said 
nikolas achievements still evoke pride among the 500000 
montenegrins who account for about 5 percent of the yugoslav 
population in a series of battles against the ottoman turks 
nikola managed to triple the area of his realm and keep it 
independent

frustrated citizens waging their own war on drugs 
could become victims of retaliation or spawn more shootouts like 
one in tacoma in which hundreds of rounds were fired warn police 
in several northwest cities 
the potential is always there said yakima police chief 
pleas green 
spokane police lt robert van leuven agreed and said the same 
kind of potential for violence was present no matter where you 
go 
theres always a level of frustration within a community 
whether its a manpower problem or a jail space problem or the 
criminal justice system doesnt react as quickly as citizens would 
like said police spokesman dave simpson of portland ore 
there is potential for citizens to carry their frustration one 
step further and react rather than wait for police 
i think there are several spots where that kind of blowup 
could occur where gangs are trying to establish a turf said 
sgt dick alberthal of the king county police drug enforcement 
unit king county includes seattle 
police who were interviewed agreed that sales of crack cocaine 
heroin methedrine and other highly addictive drugs in 
neighborhoods previously free of significant drug dealing posed a 
danger of violent backlashes 
the tacoma shootout involved a block watch organized resident 
bill foulk who is an army staff sergeant in the 2nd ranger 
battalion at fort lewis 
after a newspaper reported that the group was videotaping what 
foulk and others believed was a crack house he was hit by 
threats from occupants and habitues of the dwelling 
when shots were fired at his house during a block watch barbecue 
sept 23 a dozen of his fellow rangers were there to return fire 
police estimated 200 to 300 rounds were fired without anyone 
being hurt 
two people arrested following the fusillade were identified by 
police as members of the hillside crips a gang linked to drug 
dealing no rangers were arrested although their private firearms 
were confiscated 
foulk said people working to shut down crack houses should arm 
themselves and prepare mutualaid defense plans with friends and 
neighbors 
as soon as you start affecting that drug income they are 
more than likely to be violent he said im not advocating 
violence but i am saying you have to be prepared 
few police said they saw any imminent danger of similar blowups 
in their cities 
even in tacoma i think that was a real anomaly said 
seattle police capt harvey ferguson 
but tacoma police spokesman mark mann said some neighborhoods 
might be even more tense than the hilltop area he blamed crack for 
a 16 percent increase in violent crime in 1988 citing complaints 
of drugrelated activity at 1000 to 1200 houses and other sites 
throughout the city last year 
mann said tacoma police had reports of antidrug forces arming 
themselves but not in a blockwatch environment or in groups 
green in yakima and simpson in portland said their officers try 
to encourage grassroots groups to avoid getting involved with 
weapons police advise other tactics against dealers instead 
mobilize the neighborhood get the good people together 
mann said let that person in the target house know invite 
that person to a block party 
most officers favor civilians just collecting customers license 
numbers and other details for police 
i would not suggest complaining directly to occupants or 
owners advised van leuven in spokane 
these individuals are in a highrisk business a type of 
business where you find the people who are dealing drugs are often 
also using the drugs which means a lot of times you got somebody 
under the influence of drugs this can be very hazardous to your 
health 
videotaping drew a more mixed response partly because 
videotapes shot from the street virtually never show identifiable 
drugs and thus are worthless in court mann said it can invite 
violent retaliation 
if you back a little rattlesnake into a corner hes going to 
bite you he said

mexican president carlos salinas de gortari 
arrived here sunday on an official visit that the bush 
administration hopes will reinforce the steady improvement in 
usmexican relations seven agreements are expected to be signed 
during salinas stay 
president bush who has met with salinas twice previously 
invited the mexican leader to his retreat at camp david for a 
family dinner sunday evening a more formal meeting was planned for 
the white house on tuesday 
the agreements they were to sign during the visit were symbolic 
of increased usmexican cooperation since bush and salinas 
assumed the presidency of their respective countries within a few 
weeks of each other less than a year ago 
the pacts cover such issues as trade investment the 
environment tourism and law enforcement according to us 
officials 
officials from both sides seemed relieved that the spirit of 
hostility which characterized crossborder relations during the 
reagan administration has largely disappeared 
us officials who briefed reporters friday on the condition 
they not be identified by name said mexican authorities have been 
very cooperative in attempting to regulate the flow of undocumented 
aliens from central america over the past six months 
even more encouraging to the administration has been evidence of 
a serious mexican effort to curb drug smuggling 
theres a major national commitment by the salinas 
administration to drug interdiction one us official told 
reporters he added that 25 percent of mexicos armed forces work 
on drug eradication and interdiction 
during a visit to mexico in august secretary of state james a 
baker iii hailed salinas economic policies as bold and 
farsighted 
us officials believe that mexicos program of tax reform 
encouraging foreign investment and lowering trade barriers could 
serve as a model for other nations struggling to overcome the 
effects of a huge foreign debt 
in july mexico reached an agreement with commercial banks that 
provides for among other things a reduction in the countrys debt 
servicing obligations payments on the countrys 107 billion 
foreign debt have contributed to a sharp decline in living 
standards over the past seven years 
one official who briefed reporters friday noted that a year ago 
there were widespread predictions of political turmoil and economic 
catastrophe in mexico 
to president salinas great credit he has i think surprised 
all of the skeptics with his performance politically and 
economically and what he is doing with the mexican economy is in 
the history of that country revolutionary the official said 
usmexican tensions also have eased because both countries are 
pursuing far less ideological policies in central america 
mexico disagreed profoundly with the reagan administrations 
military involvement in central america during that same period 
state department officials were embittered by mexicos efforts to 
undercut american policy toward that region 
with officials known more for pragmatism than ideological 
militancy in charge now in both countries the relationship between 
the respective foreign ministries is better than at any time in 
years 
still disagreements remain as an example mexico opposed us 
efforts in the organization of american states this past summer for 
decisive action against panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega 
in contrast to the us policy of not recognizing panamas 
government mexico is one of the few latin american countries which 
still has an ambassador accredited in panama

jim bakker returns to the stand for more 
crossexamination at his fraud trial monday after a session last 
week that even his defense lawyer says very devastating to his 
case 
bakker charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy related 
to his handling of finances at the television ministry testified 
friday that he never defrauded anyone or conspired with others at 
ptl to commit fraud he is expected to wind up his testimony monday 
the case probably will go to the jury late this week 
george davis bakkers lead defense attorney didnt appear 
confident that bakkers testimony friday had convinced the jury his 
client is innocent 
that was a pretty heavy crossexamination the 82yearold 
davis told the greensboro news amp record when asked how he thought 
the questioning had gone it was very damaging very 
devastating 
he smiled weakly and added it didnt have anything to do with 
the issues but 
several episodes during fridays testimony indicated bakkers 
team may have been caught offguard 
in one instance a defense chart was ruled inadmissible partly 
because it summarized information not in evidence 
in several other instances bakker claimed he had told viewers 
on his television shows that some changes would be made in the ptl 
lodging programs at issue in the charges against him 
but he was unable to say when he made the announcements even 
though the defense has had access for several months to the same 
ptl videotapes and program summaries that the government has 
during three hours of crossexamination bakker answered i 
dont remember or its equivalent more than three dozen times 
during his initial testimony bakker said that when he left ptl 
in march 1987 he had built was building or had plans for 
accommodations for more than 211000 lifetime partners for ptl 
lifetime partnerships are the ptl lodging benefits at issue in 
the fraud charges ptl offered contributors free lodging at hotels 
at ptls heritage usa retreat typically three nights each year 
for life in exchange for contributions typically 1000 
bakker is accused of exceeding the announced limits on the 
number of partnerships hes also accused of diverting most of the 
158 million in proceeds from the announced purpose of construction 
to ptls general operating expenses including about 37 million 
in salary and bonuses for himself from 1984 to 1987 
about 152000 lifetime partnerships were sold between january 
1984 and may 1987 including 66000 in the heritage grand hotel 
where bakker had said only 25000 would be sold and 74000 in the 
stillunfinished towers hotel where bakker had said only 30000 
would be sold 
bakker attempted to show jurors a summary chart of the various 
hotels lodges bunkhouses chalets and campsites he said could 
have accommodated the 211000 partners 
but prosecutor deborah smith and fellow prosecutor jerry miller 
kept the chart from being admitted into evidence 
they argued that the chart summarized information that was not 
in evidence the defense had neither introduced its own evidence 
that some of the facilities were to be built nor elicited that 
testimony from witnesses 
they also said it was misleading bakker said overflow from 
the hotels could be housed in some of the other facilities but 
prosecutors pointed out that lifetime partners had been offered 
their choice of lodging 
bakkers direct testimony answering questions from his own 
attorney dealt largely with his career and with his vision for ptl 
but he touched several times on the difficulty of raising enough 
money to keep ptl going 
you never ever ever get away from the pressure you have to 
raise money for next week next month next year he said 
bakker insisted that his lifetime partnership programs never 
deceived his viewers and that he never hid information from his 
board of directors as the government has charged 
he flatly accused one former employee former top aide david 
taggart of lying when taggart testified that bakker had him relay 
instructions to divert lifetime partnership money to ptls general 
expenses

two rockets struck central kabul 
sunday one exploding near the police headquarters and hospital 
officials reported the missiles killed at least 13 people and 
wounded 24 
the officials said most of the victims were standing in line at 
a gasoline station waiting to receive their daily fuel ration 
witnesses said sunday was police day honoring the police force 
and one rocket blew up in a downtown park near police headquarters 
the hospital officials did not know if any policemen were among the 
casualties and the government made no comment on the attacks 
the second rocket exploded near the ministry of mines and 
industry building in the large presidential compound 
many merchants on chicken street the main shopping street lined 
with carpet and antique stores drew the shutters and closed their 
businesses as ambulance crews removed the dead and wounded 
kabul has been the target of almost daily rocket attacks since 
late june with anticommunist guerrillas stationed in the 
surrounding hills firing the missiles into the city the attacks 
have killed more than 350 people and injured about 800 
the marxist government claims the rebels fire the rockets at 
random into kabul to spread panic among civilians and make them 
flee to guerrillacontrolled areas 
the rebels who have been battling government forces for a 
decade have denied some of the rocket attacks and say the kabul 
government fires at its own people 
most of the rebel factions have bases across the border in 
pakistan and receive military aid from the united states while the 
soviet union backs the government

dozens of east germans including some who 
missed a special train to west germany hours earlier arrived 
sunday at the west german embassy in warsaw hoping to follow their 
compatriots to the west 
up to 100 new refugees sat glumly in cars or milled about the 
street in front of the embassy 
several said they were certain there eventually would be another 
freedom train for them 
juerg sachs of schwerin in northern east germany said he and 
his wife daniela arrived in warsaw at 2 am sunday just before 
the special train left he said they were not able to reach the 
embassy in time to catch the train that departed at 250 am 
sachs 29 said he had been reassured by an official inside the 
embassy compound who told him you missed the train but dont 
worry because there will be another solution in four to six 
weeks 
better six weeks in warsaw than another six years in the 
gdr sachs said using the initials for the formal name of his 
communist homeland the german democratic republic 
about 800 east german refugees in warsaw and 6000 in prague 
czechoslovakia were allowed to travel to west germany in special 
trains late saturday and sunday under terms of a historic eastwest 
accord 
however east germany said it now expects west germany to resume 
normal international customs at its embassies indicating it 
wants the bonn government to bar refugees from its diplomatic 
compounds 
polands official pap news agency said sunday that east germany 
showed high flexibility and understanding for this human 
dimension of the problems in allowing the exodus 
poland has a new government led by noncommunists but it has 
handled the refugee issue cuatiously trying not to antagonize east 
germany a warsaw pact ally 
paps report sunday said again that poland had considered the 
refugees a problem to be settled between the two germanys it said 
it had only provided logistical and technical assistance to the 
talks that led to the eastwest accord 
the agency said the issue should not lead to deteriorating 
relations with either of the german states 
poland took a more liberal approach toward the refugees than its 
hardline communist neighbor czechoslovakia polish officials let 
the refugees move freely around the city but in prague they were 
crowded into the embassy compound 
a west german embassy worker said sunday that east germanys 
decision to let the refugees travel to the west would not 
discourage more from coming to poland 
i think just the opposite he said speaking on condition of 
anonymity

turned up drugtrafficking links in nevada texas and mexico 
seven people were in custody in los angeles and nevada in 
connection with the haul the largest seizure in the world six 
warehouses in el paso texas as well as three homes across the 
border in ciudad juarez mexico were raided by police who said 
the facilities were used as stopovers by the suspected smugglers 
we feel these warehouses were used as staging warehouses 
before the cocaine was sent to los angeles said us drug 
enforcement administration special agent phil jordan

el paso before ending up in a san fernando valley warehouse 
operating as adrianas pottery warehouse where police and federal

managed to gain entrance and snatch up mexican pottery that was 
part of the companys merchandise 
no arrests were made and police said nothing of evidentiary 
value was taken 
when drug enforcement agents across the country heard of the 
bust possible connections to the smugglers began emerging 
one such link between the los angeles seizure and a house in 
juarez was confirmed when one of the los angeles suspects 
telephoned the house from jail and a police officer there answered

secret compartments were seized outside the house in one of

it was banned as bad taste in marengo but 
organizers determined to let the chips fall where they may did just 
that in a cowpie contest complete with cheerleaders urging on the 
bovine contestants 
the idea of people wagering on the wanderings and droppings 
of a cow was too much for marengo mayor richard baker who vetoed 
plans to hold the contest in the northern illinois town as a 
fundraiser for marengos annual settlers days 
organizer bob begora was undaunted every party has its 
pooper he said so he got permission to hold the contest 
saturday at the seven acres antique village amp museum in nearby 
union 
there were no party poopers at the contest where about 250 
people watched from bleachers as one cow at a time wandered a grid 
marked off in 100 3footby3foot squares begora said 
you put the names of the ticketholders on the square and if 
the cow poops on your square you win 1250 begora said on 
the third drop it landed on a line so we split the prize between 
two ticketholders 
begora said 300 tickets were sold at 25 each so three cows 
were used for three separate contests some people bought tickets 
from as far away as st louis because of the publicity generated 
when the contest was banned in marengo begora said 
six cheerleaders known as the pooperettes exhorted the crowd 
to encourage the cows and the first dropping was accompanied by 
the release of 150 homing pigeons and a band playing their version 
of hallelujah begora said 
the cows were fed immediately before with a mixture designed to 
act as a natural laxative 
the contest raised 3750 for settlers days and begora said he 
would like to hold the contest again next year

thousands of east germans received a 
triumphal welcome in west germany sunday after their government 
agreed to let them flee to the west it was the latest chapter in a 
historic exodus from a divided soviet bloc 
we made it we made it screamed one tearful young woman 
after arriving in this northern bavarian city at dawn 
we had no future there said 34yearold uwe kuester of 
cottbus 
about 6000 refugees either arrived or were on their way from 
czechoslovakia border police said and another 800 arrived from 
poland 
the refugees began gathering weeks ago in the west german 
embassies in warsaw and prague after they were unable to reach 
hungary a liberal warsaw pact nation that had opened its western 
border to the east germans last month 
many of those arriving wept with joy others cheered and clapped 
in prague and warsaw east germans who heard of the exodus raced 
to railroad stations some arriving in time to jump on board the 
trains west german news reports and witnesses said more east 
germans were rushing in their cars toward czechoslovakia and at 
least 200 were once again filling the embassy in prague 
up to 100 more east germans assembled at the west german embassy 
in warsaw on sunday 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of west germany 
indicated in a television interview late sunday that west germany 
was talking with east germany about passage to the west for the new 
refugees 
also in the future we will use all our powers and 
possibilities to help those seeking refuge as we have done in 
the past and up until the last several hours genscher said in 
the interview with the zdf television network 
genscher later told ard television he hoped for a parallel 
solution for the latest east germans at the embassy in prague 
the new arrivals follow the more than 24000 east germans who 
have fled through hungary since sept 10 when the reformminded 
communist government in budapest decided to open its border 
hardline east germany reluctantly agreed to the exodus and 
trains began shuttling refugees from prague late saturday trains 
from poland arrived on sunday 
the east german government insisted the refugees from prague and 
warsaw had been expelled 
on sunday the east german foreign ministry accused west germany 
of damaging international norms by giving east germans refuge 
inside bonns embassies in prague and warsaw in the first place 
the governments adn television reported 
as part of the agreement with west germany that was announced 
saturday night the east germans had to travel in staterun trains 
back through their former communist homeland as a facesaving 
measure for the government 
czechoslovakia also with a hardline government had vowed that 
it would not allow the refugees to leave for the west from 
czechoslovakia 
still the action represented an embarrassing retreat for the 
aging leadership in east berlin which had severely criticized 
hungarys action 
the onceunthinkable exodus of east germans reflects dramatic 
changes in the soviet bloc and a growing disunity among its member 
states 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev the galvanizing force for 
reforms sweeping much of eastern europe will visit east berlin 
friday and saturday for celebrations of east germanys 40th 
anniversary 
his talks with east german leader erich honecker are expected to 
deal with the exodus which has threatened the nations already 
demoralized work force 
i hope that gorbachev during his talks with the leaders of 
east germany will try to convince them that political reforms are 
also in the interest of the german democratic republic said 
genscher 
a highranking soviet official was quoted by the west german die 
welt newspaper as saying moscow welcomed east germanys decision to 
allow the weekend exodus 
valentin falin head of the soviet central committees 
international relations section also said he believed gorbachev 
will travel to east berlin with important messages for both german 
governments die welt said there was no elaboration 
east berlin emphasized it expected the latest exodus to be a 
onetime event after which west germany would return to normal 
international customs at its embasssies 
in prague police initially surrounded the west german embassy 
to block newly arrived east germans from scaling a spiked fence 
into the muddy grounds but the embassy later again began letting 
east germans back into the embassy 
bavarian border police spokesman klaus pappenfuss said six 
trains were bringing the more than 6000 refugees from prague 
during the course of the day 
wellwishers handed out bottles of wine champagne and fruit as 
the east germans disembarked in hof red cross volunteers 
distributed hot tea noodle soup baby food and diapers to the 
refugee families 
several former east germans who had fled earlier to the west 
from hungary carried a banner that read 
we got out through hungary and you made it through prague 
soon the zone east germany will be an empty coffin 
sven mueller a 27yearold metal worker said it was strange 
passing through east germany on our way here but we knew we were 
all right because there were west german officials on board 
many of the refugees quickly made their way to a bank of 
telephone booths in the station in efforts to reach relatives in 
east germany 
most had little or no west german currency and those who did 
faced constant busy signals from east germanys overtaxed telephone 
circuits 
amid the crush on the platform loudspeakers called out the 
names of new arrivals who had relatives waiting for them 
the east germans were taken immediately to several refugee 
processing centers and temporary shelters set up by border police 
and the military officials said 
west german law automatically grants east germans citizenship on 
arrival more than 100000 east germans have emigrated or fled to 
west germany this year 
the have flooded to the west because of disillusionment with 
political repression and economic stagnation in their homeland

weve always been compulsive obsessive collectors of odd 
tidbits of information how many people wear torn underwear under 
their expensive clothes how many unmatched socks lie lonely in 
dresser drawers explain mel poretz and barry sinrod in their new 
book 
under the modest title the first really important survey of 
american habits poretz and sinrod have compiled the answers to 
the questions that have been burning holes in their curiosity 
they found for example that 19 percent of americans put both 
the sock and shoe on one foot first then the other as opposed to 
the more common way both socks and then both shoes 
men were slightly more likely to go sockshoe sockshoe 
then women they found 
how do they know these things they asked 
more precisely they polled a little over 2000 people across 
the country sinrod and poretz who are involved in marketing and 
polling say their survey represents the tastes and habits of 89 
percent of americans aged 21 and over however details like 
margins of error that are popular with the more serious surveys 
were not reported 
all totals are statistically correct and can be verified 
trust us poretz and sinrod say 
after making that leap of faith readers will learn that 
only 7 percent of americans admit looking behind a closed 
shower curtain when visiting a friends home and that such 
surreptitious glances are much more common among women aged 21 and 
34 of whom onefourth say they look behind the curtain the man 
most likely to look is aged 45 to 54 they found with one in 10 
doing so 
37 percent of americans never weigh themselves some 41 percent 
of women and 37 percent of men said they never step on the scales 
about one in three checks weight weekly while 14 percent do so 
more that four times a week 
67 percent of americans say they spend less time in the 
bathroom than their mate does the figure was the same for both 
sexes 
38 percent of the people responding say they clean their belly 
button every day 20 percent say they never do so 
53 percent eat spaghetti by winding it on a fork and 47 percent 
cut it 
80 percent eat corn on the cob by going around the ear in the 
circle 20 percent nibble from sidetoside like a typewriter 
61 percent say they would wear torn underwear 39 percent would 
not men were slightly more willing to wear the torn item 68 
percent only 57 percent of the women said they would there was 
this further breakdown 74 percent of white collar workers said 
they would wear torn underwear while only 48 percent of blue 
collar workers would

hazel has told officials of another shipwreck exposed by hurricane 
hugo 
historians and residents on saturday dug up wooden pulleys 
pieces of board and iron spikes along myrtle beach they also found 
a large piece of wood with iron sheeting attached that may have 
been a part of the boats stern 
among those digging was jack thompson who was among the first 
to find the wreckage of the freda a wiley a boston lumber ship 
bound for new orleans after hazel swept through in 1954 
i believe there were several ships in that flotilla carrying 
lumber from boston to new orleans that were caught up in the storm 
of 1898 thompson said this may be one of those lumber ships 
thompson a photographer and longtime myrtle beach resident 
found a pulley from the ship on the beach friday and notified city

house speaker thomas s foley on sunday 
predicted the house this week probably will vote to repeal medicare 
catastrophic health care coverage that it enacted last year for 
some 33 million elderly americans 
many beneficiaries especially the wealthier among them have 
balked at having to pay premiums this year of up to 800 to cover 
the hospital and physicians bills for lowerincome retirees 
i hope personally that the program is retained on a modified 
form foley dwash said on nbcs meet the press program 
but there are a great number of republicans and some 
democrats in the house who are in favor of repeal if i were 
guessing today i think it probably would be repealed 
foley also said he doubts that the reconciliation bill will be 
completed by an oct 16 deadline broad acrosstheboard spending 
cuts in both domestic and military programs will take effect 
automatically then unless it is 
we might have some few days in which there would be a 
technical sequestration that is an acrosstheboard cutting 
through executive order of all the accounts foley said 
however he added i dont think thats going to be a 
permanent situation 
in other house action a longawaited bill to protect the 
nations waterways from oil spills is expected to get to the floor 
this week after months of committee hearings and backroom 
negotiations 
similar legislation already has passed the senate but the 
version that emerged from a house committee was opposed by so many 
members that the drafters renegotiated a new proposal that could be 
sensibly managed on the floor 
the exxonvaldez tanker accident last spring that dumped 10 
million gallons of crude oil into prince william sound inspired the 
congressional review of liability laws and legislation to 
strengthen them 
though specifics werent available last week congressional 
staffers and others with an interest in the house bill believe the 
main sticking point preemption of states rights to enact laws 
stricter than federal statutes will have to be worked out by the 
full house through floor votes 
other items such as limits on how much the federal government 
can charge oil companies for spills are expected to be included in 
the revised legislation before it goes to the floor thursday 
the house also will continue work this week on reducing the 
federal deficit through the bill known as the budget reconciliation 
act of 1989 
this week members will decide whether to repeal catastrophic 
medical insurance for retirees or to reduce benefits and choose 
between competing plans for increasing childcare assistance to 
lowincome families 
on the senate side the finance committee begins work on a 
package of spending reductions and revenue increases designed to 
cut the budget deficit by about 17 billion this fiscal year 
the biggest issue facing the panel is whether to reduce the tax 
on capital gains which president bush recommended as a saving 
incentive and temporary revenueraising measure and the house 
approved last week 
senate majority leader george mitchell said sunday on the same 
nbc program that he has the votes to defeat the housepassed 
version of president bushs capital gains measure 
it is so bad so wrong for the economy he said it will 
do for the deficit what crack does for the user a quick short high 
followed by a long painful depression 
mitchell however said bushs irresponsible position 
makes it extremely difficult to prevent any tax cut from 
occurring on a very close vote 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the finance panel is 
recommending a partial restoration of tax deductibility of 
contributions to individual retirement accounts or iras as an 
alternative to the capital gains cuts 
meanwhile conference committees will be continue on several 
appropriations bills telling each department how much and where it 
can spend money 
last week there was a negotiating session between house and 
senate conferees thrashing out the defense authorization bill one 
of the stickiest in the package 
a major sticking point is how much the government will spend on 
star wars in fiscal 1990 the senate has appropriated 37 billion 
but the house wants to spend only 31 billion 
the house government operations subcommittee on employment and 
housing continues its investigation into scandals at the department 
of housing and urban development with a return appearance by 
selfdescribed influence peddler paul manafort 
stonewalled by the leading players in the scandal the 
subcommittee wants to job manaforts memory about projects linked 
to him by other witnesses since his first appearance in june 
back then manafort acknowledged that he used his influence 
among political appointees at hud to steer millions of dollars in 
government renovation funds to a housing project in which he shared 
ownership 
however he his alexandria va firm of black manafort stone 
amp kelly did relatively little hud business since then other 
witnesses have connected the firm with projects in new jersey 
connecticut georgia and puerto rico

violence 
the united national party issued a statement saying a party 
committee had made the recommendations in a report to president 
ranasinghe premadasa there was no immediate response from the 
president 
sri lanka an island off the southern coast of india is torn by 
a separatist war with minority tamils and a violent backlash by 
majority sinhalese more than 11000 people have been killed since 
the tamil insurgency started in 1983 and 5000 others have been 
killed in the sinhalese violence 
in another political development sunday the most powerful of 
the tamil rebel groups the liberation tigers of tamil eelam said 
it was willing to participate in elections in northeastern sri

soldiers withdrawn and to increase tamil autonomy in the northeast 
india sent troops into sri lanka under an indiabrokered peace 
accord between the sinhalese and tamils that collapsed india has 
promised to withdraw all of its troops by the end of the year

that arias and eight other members of his christian democratic 
party were arrested while they toured the countryside campaigning 
for the ouster of gen manuel antonio noriega the countrys 
military chief who controls the government 
adoc as the opposition coalition is known by its spanish 
initials said the nine were arrested in the western province of 
veraguas on orders of the provincial attorney general for alleged 
subversive activities

christian democratic party leaders the party is a member of adoc 
arias calderon ran as one of two opposition vice presidential 
candidates in the may 7 national elections on a ticket led by 
presidential candidate guillermo endara the government annulled 
the returns which showed the opposition winning by a landslide 
a spokesman at the defense forces in panama city said sunday he

the leader of a nominally 
independent black homeland told a crowd of 15000 people at a 
funeral service sunday that if they want a referendum on rejoining 
south africa he will arrange it 
maj gen bantu holomisa who took power in the xhosa homeland 
of transkei in a bloodless coup in december 1988 addressed the 
crowd during the funeral for a thembu clan chief king sabata 
dalindyebo who opposed the territory being declared independent in 
1976 
dalindyebo a relative of african national congress leader 
nelson mandela died in lusaka zambia in 1986 and his body was 
sent home for burial but the homeland leaders fearing 
demonstrations of support buried the body in a commoners 
graveyard 
the body was exhumed last week for reburial in the chiefs 
cemetery 
transkei is one of four black homelands south africans 
whitedominated government has declared independent but they are 
not recognized by any other country most black south africans 
oppose the homeland system because it deprives the residents of 
south african citizenship residence work and pension rights 
there were antiholomisa chants among the crowd before the 
33yearold military officer took the stage with major south 
african antiapartheid figures such as mandelas wife winnie 
but by the end of holomisas speech delivered in the xhosa 
language many people were shouting amandla which means 
power 
holomisa said if the people of transkei wanted a referendum on 
rejoining south africa he would organize it he did not specify in 
his short speech how the people would make their desire known and 
there is no indication the south african government would accept 
such a decision 
holomisa said he had allowed the exhumation and reburial of 
dalindyebos remains because the people wanted it 
dalindyebo was the traditional leader of thembuland which 
covers most of transkei he was forced out of office by his cousin 
kaiser matanzima in 1975 and fled to lusaka where he joined the 
anc 
the south african government supported matanzima because he had 
agreed to transkei becoming the first independent homeland as part 
of the apartheid policy of creating separate nations for each black 
tribe

you can expect to hear more british accents 
among the new breed of race track owners in the country 
bookmakers schooled in britains gaming industry that allows 
bettors to put money on anything from the sex of a royal baby to 
whether elvis will return in a spaceship are looking to the united 
states to strike out on their own or expand their vast holdings 
many of these entrepreneurs see this country as a growing 
gambling market despite the threats of high land costs and 
competition from state lotteries illegal sports betting and 
casinos 
the lure of offtrack betting in pennsylvania and other states 
has attracted the new race track buyers for them offtrack 
betting holds the promise of bringing gambling specifically 
thoroughbred and harness racing to a broader range of people by 
bringing it closer to their homes and offices in a fashionable 
entertainment setting 
at least five of the 10 major race track deals this year were 
fueled by the buyers desire to exploit offtrack betting 
opportunities or simulcasting which allows tracks to take bets on 
races at other tracks 
european companies think america represents a tremendous otb 
opportunity said maury wolff a parimutuel industry consultant 
with racing resource group of alexandria va you have a history 
of european success in otb enterprises and i think the people who 
run these enterprises look at the us and see it as an untapped 
market for offtrack betting 
bob green and bill hogwood two former officers in the 
londonbased hillmecca gambling giant left their jobs to form 
greenwood racing inc which bought philadelphia park months after 
offtrack betting was approved in pennsylvania they paid 63 
million for the track nearly double what its previous owners paid 
five years ago 
the states horse racing commission has yet to approve the deal 
ladbroke racing corp the us subsidiary of british gambling 
giant ladbroke group plc bought the meadows a harness track near 
pittsburgh and golden gate fields near san francisco where 
california law allows horse players to bet at county fairgrounds 
ladbroke got its start in this country five years ago with the 
purchase of detroit race course the michigan legislature has yet 
to fulfill ladbrokes hopes the lawmakers would approve offtrack 
betting 
we see otb as an opportunity to provide the racing experience 
to a wider range of people its one way to distribute to a 
wider audience and make it more attractive said david goodwill 
president and chief operating officer of ladbroke racing 
another company oregon racing headed by another british gaming 
executive is in the process of buying portland meadows operating 
agreement to take advantage of simulcasting 
key to the pending sale of canterbury downs near minneapolis are 
plans to begin a simulcast agreement with santa anita race track in 
california after the first of the year 
although the debate is just beginning in this country on 
legalized sports betting wolff and others feel race tracks with 
offtrack betting facilities would be in the best position to take 
sports wagers 
eugene christiansen of the new york gaming consulting firm 
christiansen cummings inc said offtrack betting parlors would be 
the obvious place to allow sports betting 
putting sports betting into the hands of mom and pop 
operations would expose them to some nottoofriendly 
competitors christiansen said referring to the bookies that

stakes are high and pockets deep at an annual 
venture capital conference where aspiring entrepreneurs try to 
persuade investors to risk millions on business ideas ranging from 
lightweight planes to submarine tours 
were real excited after our research said nancy young 
whos looking for 38 million to buy a submarine and take tourists 
for an underwater look at the caribbean we have found the 
concept to be more interesting and profitable than when we first 
conceived it a year ago 
she is hoping to follow such firms as hospitality network ltd 
which got 83 million in cash and credit two years ago the 
company has multiplied 10 times in value since then founder chris 
tyson said 
then theres bookstop inc which got 35 million three years 
ago when it was a fivestore moneylosing chain 
last week new yorkbased bdb corp parent of b dalton 
bookseller and barnes amp noble paid a reported 10 million to buy 
controlling interest in the company which now operates 22 stores 
in four states 
bookstop is on its way to doing the kind of fantastic things 
that we all talk about said jerry white director of southern 
methodist universitys caruth institute of ownermanaged business 
which is sponsoring the southwest venture capital conference in 
dallas 
basically what we do is give people a 10minute opportunity 
whether they pull it off is in their ball park white said 
many of these venture capital firms you would have 
difficulty getting an appointment with white said estimating it 
would take a year and 100000 of travel to get access to the same 
investors 
getting past the secretary is going to be a major ordeal and 
getting your story told is going to be another ordeal he said 
if you compete in the conference and win a spot youll get your 
story out to the industry 
this is the seventh conference the institute has sponsored along 
with newly merged accountants ernst amp young and a dallas law firm 
white estimates investors have provided 100 million to growing 
businesses either directly from the conference or through contacts 
made as a result of the meeting 
the conference gave tyson the opportunity he had been unable to 
get elsewhere as he searched for investors in his austinbased 
hospitality network which provides cable television service to the 
hotel industry 
on a wild hair i decided to submit a business plan to the 
conference because i knew i would get in front of a bunch of 
folks tyson said i spoke gave a little slide show on where 
this company would go and we had em lining up at the door 
more than 150 business plans are submitted annually to the 
conference the plans are valuated and the 20 or so deemed to have 
the best ideas are then given time in front of the potential 
investors 
the only people in the room are the presenters and the 
investors white said then the companies are given a room at one 
of dallas upscale hotels where they wait to see if any interested 
investors come by 
theres a second 20 white said who dont get time but 
have their plans forwarded to the investors the remaining never 
make it to the investors 
that screening is what has made the conference popular with 
venture capitalists white said 
if a venture capitalist can have a competitive committee of 
people that screens 150 deals down to the best 20 and presents them 
in a timeefficient process we feel thats a very efficient mode 
of looking for deals on behalf of the venture capitalist he said 
about 150 venture capital funds pay 150 each to attend the 
conference presenters who are usually from the southwest pay 
500 this years twoday conference starts monday 
white said many of the plans chosen are technologydriven 
reflecting investors bias in that area and generally are firms 
that have been in business for some time and an experienced 
management already in place 
this years finalists include eight hightech firms that sell 
software and other computerrelated products others include a 
company that designs makes and markets solar collector products a 
manufacturer of lowcost lightweight aircraft and young 
enterprises idea for sub tours

as part of an ambitious holiday sales campaign 
that has the nations second biggest retailer dreaming about a 
green christmas k mart corp has hooked up with nbc on a 
television special 
the holiday promotion is tied to a central theme that will be 
reinforced with store signs print and broadcast advertising and a 
new song sung by kenny rogers who stars in the tv show 
retailers usually pull out all the stops to pump up christmas 
sales because the season generates about half of their annual 
profits 
this years peak shopping season will be particularly important 
for k mart because the discounter didnt do as well as it might 
have liked during the first half of 1989 income sagged nearly 16 
percent to 239 million in the first six months from 284 million 
in 1988s first half 
christmas 1989 is going to be a very competitive year theres 
no doubt about it said michael g wellman k marts vice 
president of marketing for those retailers that really have a 
strong merchandising and marketing program christmas will be very 
merry 
wellman said k marts preparations built around one main theme 
should put the retailer in a strong position to capitalize on 
seasonal business 
with a chain of 2200 general merchandise stores spanning 48 
states k mart estimates that half of the us population shops at 
its stores each month 
k mart is relying on a variation of the holiday theme it used 
last year taken from the book christmas in america a coffee 
table pictorial of festivities and slices of life from around the 
country 
the book which was in general distribution and sold at k marts 
and the retailers waldenbooks stores proved popular earning a 
place on the new york times nonfiction bestseller list for several 
weeks running 
the special to be aired on nbc during prime time the week of 
dec 10 christmas in america a love story stars 
singerentertainer kenny rogers as a professional photographer 
in the hourlong drama undoubtedly written for maximum 
heartstring tugging at an emotionally charged time of year rogers 
flashes back on his life via his photographs which are on exhibit 
at a museum some of the photographs used in the tv special are 
from the christmas in america book and others are rogers own 
rogers screen son is played by his reallife son kenny rogers 
jr and his wife by actress ashley crow 
the film was produced by king world productions inc and is the 
first advertisersupported network project for the king world 
division formed last year to develop and produce original 
programming sponsored by advertisers king world distributes 
several top syndicated programs including wheel of fortune 
jeopardy and the oprah winfrey show 
barbara loren an advisor to k mart who is coordinating the 
christmas campaign said the role the retailer played in bringing 
the special to tv was unprecedented it also represents a new twist 
in a trend toward retailers and networks working closely together 
on promotional efforts 
k mart and cbs formed an alliance ahead of the new tv season 
that had the twofold purpose of boosting the retailers 
backtoschool business and touting the networks program lineup 
retail industry leader sears roebuck and co had a similar matchup 
with nbc 
the results are still coming in but the early readings indicate 
the retailers benefited from their partnerships 
theres nothing that we have seen to imply that this has been 
anything less than a pretty successful promotion wellman said in 
an interview k mart and other major general merchandise chains 
department and specialty stores will report their september sales 
on thursday 
loren president of the retail consulting firm lorensynder 
marketing inc said k mart helped initiate the tv special because 
last year it had secured the film rights to the christmas in 
america book 
usually a network owns a production and seeks advertisers to 
support the programming in this case it was k mart executives who 
pitched the idea to nbc loren said 
the tv special is part of k marts christmas promotion which 
includes a range of marketing reinforcements to get across its 
theme pictures of kenny rogers will be prominent in k mart stores 
and a new song he has recorded written by dolly parton will be 
piped over stores public address systems 
loren said the mood of the country is such that the christmas 
in america ballad could become a hit 
we are going to a traditional conservative decade she 
said the country is ready for the next white christmas

the immense business empire of the 
nationalist government long a key element in the control of 
taiwan is under attack and plans are being made to begin its sale 
now that the people of taiwan have won some say in this islands 
political process they are demanding a larger share of the 
economic pie the government has reacted by promising to sell off 
some of its numerous firms 
but critics say the government and party arent going far enough 
and that taiwans rulers will maintain control of the financial 
empire through joint ventures stock schemes and other roundabout 
ways 
about half of all the total assets of taiwans companies are 
controlled directly or indirectly by the ruling nationalist party 
or the government the net worth of these assets is more than 380 
billion according to kang ninghsiang a legislator of the 
fledgling opposition democratic progressive party who has 
researched the holdings 
together the party and government dominate taiwans petroleum 
industry telecommunication systems railways steel cement and 
shipbuilding plants and parts of the mass media 
the government also owns 70 percent of taiwans 9 million acres 
of land and maintains a firm grip on the economy through its 
control of foreign exchange and the banking system 
from gasoline for cars to raw materials for the clothes we 
wear everything is more or less under the nationalist control 
said kang 
inhabitants on this island of 20 million already among the most 
densely populated in the world have to fight the most severe 
battle for the limited resources open to the public said kang 
the nationalists and as many as 2 million followers fled to 
taiwan in 1949 following their loss in a civil war to the communist 
forces in china since then the party and the state have been 
inseparable the democratic progressive party a legal entity since 
1987 has yet to come close to challenging nationalist supremacy 
in taiwan economic interests have been the foundation of 
nationalist rule through them the party dispenses favors to 
loyalists and privileges to cooperative private businesses 
in the beginning the favors went mostly to the mainlanders who 
fled with the nationalists but as local taiwanese slowly began to 
assert themselves both economically and politically the 
nationalists attempted to attract them with favors too 
pressure on the party and government to turn state and 
partyrun firms private increased after taiwan lifted martial law 
in 1987 paving the way for the current political liberalization 
a prosperous economy added more pressure creating an abundance 
of idle cash looking for investment opportunities 
in august the government announced that 19 of taiwans 59 
staterun firms will either go public or be sold to private 
enterprises under a program that may take many years to complete 
among the firms to be made private are several banks insurance 
companies chemical firms steel mills and a shipbuilder many of 
the concerns have lost money and drained government finances 
despite their total or near monopolies 
but the government will retain the bulk of its holdings such as 
the lucrative chinese petroleum corp which monopolizes oil 
imports exploration refinery gasoline stations and several 
petrochemical products 
the nationalists will see to it that they will not lose much 
of their economic or political influence with the conversion to 
private companies said chu yunhan professor of political science 
at the national taiwan university 
the government is expected to hold minority shares in the 
companies it sells thereby allowing the nationalist party 
continued influence chu said 
the party will continue to appoint retired officials as key 
executives at the companies and secure the iron ballots of 
employees in elections he said 
despite the governments program to sell public companies 
nationalist party officials said they had no similar plans to 
reduce the giant partyowned business empire 
the party network of about 50 companies includes one that 
finances all stock purchases for taiwans stock market 
the party also owns a television station a radio station and a 
newspaper constituting a powerful propaganda tool 
lawmakers from the democratic progressive party have vowed to 
end what they claim is the flow from national coffers to party 
coffers but most efforts have failed because of the complexity 
of these businesses many of which are joint ventures with private 
businesses 
the government decided this year to cut its annual subsidy of 9 
million to the partys broadcasting corp of china by 10 percent 
each year for three consecutive years 
opposition activists accuse the nationalists of funneling money 
from their businesses into the campaign coffers of ruling party 
politicians the prestigious journalist weekly said ruling 
partyowned companies and other state sources contribute an 
estimated 75 million to campaign funds in each national election 
political observers say exclusive government contracts or 
monopolies of partyowned businesses eventually will have to end 
forcing some companies to close 
but the road will be rocky 
most of the new benefits will go to the vested interests 
says legislator kang true liberalization has a long way to go

just 37 percent of us executives surveyed 
recently said they have begun implementing strategies to deal with 
the unified european market planned for 1992 
the fact that the majority have not taken action shows they 
may be greatly underestimating the impact of the single european 
market on their businesses said john j hurley director of the 
international division at peat marwickboston 
the 12 membernations of the european economic community plan to 
dissolve market borders at the end of 1992 creating a unified 
market with common product standards and expectations of greater 
competition 
the survey by the accounting firm kpmg peat marwick released 
last week found that most us executives believe a unified europe 
will benefit european firms and that american companies should ally 
with european firms 
peat marwick surveyed executives in four fields considered the 
most likely yo be involved in trade with the ec manufacturing 
high technology merchandising and transportation 
of 10000 surveys mailed in february and march to a random 
sampling of executives 993 were returned and 872 were usable 
according to peat marwick the survey has a sampling error of plus 
or minus 3 percent 
more than half of the executives said they expected the overall 
impact of the common european market on their industries in the 
united states to be minimal 
but 85 percent of the respondents said the merger would benefit 
european firms and 60 percent felt their own industries in europe 
could gain from the unified market 
most executives reported they believe the merger holds pitfalls 
for us companies that are not prepared 
eight in 10 respondents said they felt us companies will be 
pressured to acquire a european identity to gain from the new 
arrangement seventyfive percent of respondents predicted european 
authorities will grant special cost advantages to european 
companies 
one manufacturer counseled his peers against thinking the 
europeans would make it easy for us businesses to compete 
according to the survey 
theyll have the power in their hands theyll have the bat 
the ball and the playing field said the executive who was not 
identified 
eightyseven percent of respondents advised us firms to forge 
alliances with their european counterparts and 81 percent suggested 
the need for americans to increase onsite manufactuing in europe 
the survey reported that large multinational firms in high 
technology and manufacturing are taking the greatest care to 
position themselves well for the new european market
