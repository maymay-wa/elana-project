indians dismantled their blockade of 
railroad tracks near brantford ontario on sunday after the 
railway obtained a court injunction 
members of the six nations indian band blockaded the cn rail 
tracks running through their reserve about 12 miles southeast of 
brantford last wednesday to press land claims and show support for 
the mohawks on the kahnesatake settlement near oka in quebec 
cn rail obtained a court injunction ordering the removal of the 
blockade late saturday and provincial police said the natives 
removed a snow plow on the tracks without incident 
were not lawbreakers said bill montour a chief on the 
reserve it was an order by the ontario court we lost the 
battle but were still fighting the war 
other members of the six nations band continued to block two 
highways near brantford and caledonia said police sgt bob adams 
those blockades have been in place for a week and police were 
directing traffic around the area 
at the kahnesatake settlement 18 miles west of montreal about 
400 troops continued to surround a group of about 20 armed mohawk 
men and 30 women and children 
the mohawks retreated to a detoxification center in a small 
wooded area after quebec authorities ordered troops into the 
settlement last weekend to dismantle barricades put up by the 
indians 
on saturday a 51yearold mohawk tie tiertakaron was taken by 
ambulance to a montreal hospital after he was injured in a fight 
with four soldiers tiertakaron was being kept under observation at 
montreal general hospital after suffering head injuries bruises 
and lacerations hospital spokeswoman joan lamontagne said 
mohawks said tiertakaron was asleep when he was attacked and 
beaten severely by soldiers inside mohawk lines around the 
detoxification center 
the army said the soldiers acted in selfdefense after the 
mohawk attacked them while they were on a reconnaissance mission 
two soldiers suffered minor knife wounds in the incident 
the mohawks have said they wont lay down their arms without 
assurances that they will be protected from reprisals by quebec 
provincial police 
indian leaders have proposed setting up a native peacekeeping 
force for the settlement canadian authorities have rejected this 
proposal 
a quebec police officer was killed july 11 when the provincial 
police stormed a mohawk barricade erected to protest a decision by 
the town of oka to expand a municipal golf course onto land claimed 
by the indians 
the dispute over the golf course expansion was resolved when the 
federal government purchased the land and said it would give it to 
the indians but the mohawks have raised a wider range of 
grievances including demands for sovereignty

us employees of the reuters news agency have 
authorized their union leadership to call a strike against the 
company the newspaper guild of new york announced monday 
guild members voted by a larger than 201 margin last week for 
the authorization after contract talks that began nearly a year ago 
failed to result in an agreement the guild represents nearly 500 
employees including 150 journalists 
the newspaper guild in a news release blamed the failing talks 
on reuters demands that it substantially raise the cost to 
employees for their health insurance while cutting maternity 
benefits and severance pay 
andrew nibley reuters editor responsible for north america and 
latin america refused to discuss details of the negotiations while 
they are in progress 
i would say that all major us corporations are dealing with 
the whole issue of spiraling health care costs and how they can be 
contained we think that our salaries are quite competitive and 
among the best in the industry he said 
i dont think a strike would be in anyones interest and i 
certainly hope it doesnt come to that he added 
already reuters employees have engaged in informational 
picketing at the new york and american stock exchanges and at 
reuters offices 
the guild represents journalists technicians computer 
operators sales support staff customer service and clerical 
employees the last contract expired in february 
salaries at reuters range from 636 to 806 a week for 
reporters correspondents can make up to 955 office assistants 
start at 25842 per week while salaries for technicians range from 
617 to 697

you cant buy american cigarettes in 
thailand at least not legally that has a lot to do with ted chen 
the university of massachusetts public health professor has 
worked to prevent the us tobacco industry from breaking into the 
thai market chen blasts efforts to promote american tobacco in 
asia as the new opium wars 
i feel strongly about the health effects of cigarette smoking 
and i feel that if we just stop 1 percent of the increase that 
would mean millions of peoples lives are saved said chen who 
emigrated from taiwan 26 years ago 
thailands ban on american cigarettes has been the focus of a 
twoyear battle between trade and tobacco industry officials and 
public health groups 
us trade representative carla hills has threatened that unless 
thailand relaxes its ban by november thai imports will be banned 
in an amount equal to the cigarettes that might have been sold an 
estimated 166 million a year 
on the one hand the united states is the champion of world 
health for many years on the other hand now youre getting 
this image of becoming the major pusher or the major dealer of 
tobacco its really selling out the image of america said chen 
executive secretary for the asian pacific association for control 
of tobacco which he founded 
us trade officials say they are merely trying to break a thai 
monopoly on cigarettes 
we seek and try to root out trade barriers wherever we find 
them said timothy oleary a spokesman for hills i feel that 
the opponents of what were doing have their hearts in the right 
place but their energies are misdirected we feel that were doing 
what the law says we need to do 
in his fight against tobacco chen has written papers and 
testified before congress he likens the dispute to the 
19thcentury opium wars in which western powers forced china to 
buy opium so they could pay for chinese tea and silks 
ted chen of course has been a marvelous leader because he 
really has a foot in both worlds hes both an american leader and 
an asian leader said mike pertschuk codirector of the 
washingtonbased advocacy institute one of the health 
organizations opposing the cigarette exports 
john dollisson spokesman for the us cigarette exporters 
association in new york said chen and others have been 
hoodwinked into bringing in the health issue when the real issue 
is trade 
the fact is theyre thais going to smoke and whether they 
smoke our product or whether theyre going to smoke their product 
theyre going to smoke he said 
chen and his allies counter that thai smoking rates about 49 
percent of males and 4 percent of females are likely to increase 
once us advertisers get into the marketplace taiwan which 
dropped its strict tariffs in 1987 reported a 4 percent increase 
in 1988 he said 
cigarette advertising is banned in thailand but chen said he 
expects that would fall once the trade barrier is hurdled 
dollisson maintained advertising merely promotes brands and has no 
effect on overall smoking rates 
rep chester atkins dmass is cosponsoring a bill that would 
ban the government from imposing trade restrictions to open new 
cigarette markets 
our position is that there are more worthy products that the 
us government can support and that its time to dissolve the 
200year marriage between the tobacco industry and the american 
government said atkins aide jim kessler

showing by celine 
if parisiennes are casting aside their bikinis looking forward 
to tweedy autumn gear the fashion world is already dipping into 
summer 1991 with menswear in the avantgarde as well a rack show 
at porte de versailles underlines masculine summer trends shown

team under peggy huynhkinh and management by glamorous 
fashionconscious nan legeai formerly of dior 
the main guru behind celines modernism is financier bernard 
arnault whose consortium agache took over celine in 1987 and is 
also backing christian lacroix and dior 
im enthusiastic about celine but cannot talk about my future 
plans for the fashion holdings arnault said at a reception after 
the celine show last week 
while dedicated to the bounding main the crisp celine summer 
wear wont make waves but its snappy goldbuttoned blazers or 
drawstring anoraks shorts peppy knifepleated or polkadotted 
miniskirts and widebottomed flapfly sailor trousers in 
redwhiteblue combinations have a fresh appeal even for 
parisiennes tired of a long hot summer 
the multicolored horizontally striped knit jerseys in mixes of 
turquoise mocha carmine and navy or in navy tobacco and white 
looked ideal for holidays they came out in slitskirt long 
sheaths long cardigan jackets or pullover tunics and shorts 
safari and moroccoinspired wear with belted glen plaid jackets

youthful said french fashion critic vera faure 
celine fans will also be glad to see so many wellmade 
lowheeled pumps in various suede shades or with gold toes and 
heels 
the handbags emphasize celines logo for those who love 
prestige labels the gold coin and brown leather series with 
astrolab motifs is more subtle than the flashy but fun canvas

around with celines banglecharm bracelets

anniversary party at the rothschild rentachateau ferrieres 
outside paris

luxury menswear from france started by himself in 1960 along with 
the first menswear salon the field of luxury menswear was soon

joselove a top menswear buyer for niemanmarcus who was wearing 
an unstructured black claude montana suit for the blacktie

the norm for most workaday paris executives as all over the world

a camera tapes the days proceedings for a 
federal court juror who is sick and unable to attend the trial 
a closed circuit video system allows a marshal to maintain a 
security surveillance of the courtroom 
highlights of testimony in a highly publicized civil trial are 
aired on the evening news 
such are the visions of a fivejudge study committee that is 
recommending a threeyear carefully controlled experiment that 
would allow cameras and radio equipment to record proceedings in 
federal courtrooms 
the us judicial conference the policymaking arm of the 
federal courts scheduled a meeting wednesday to consider the 
proposal the conference has 27 federal judges as its members and 
is headed by chief justice william h rehnquist 
there are signs of erosion in the solid opposition that has kept 
cameras out of federal courts 
rehnquist said last may that he was by no means averse to the 
idea of an experimental program rehnquists predecessor warren 
e burger was dead set against the idea over my dead body 
burger reportedly said of a proposal to televise supreme court 
proceedings 
and while the study committee reported that most federal judges 
oppose a blanket lifting of all restrictions on cameras in the 
courtroom it said the substantial majority favor the committees 
more cautious deliberative approach 
the panel headed by us district judge robert f peckham of 
san francisco called the current rules governing cameras unduly 
restrictive and said they should be expanded somewhat to 
include security and other areas of judicial administration 
it also voted 41 to open some civil but not criminal 
proceedings to camera coverage and broadcast 
like the chief justice a majority of your committee is not 
averse to controlled experimentation on a voluntary basis and would 
like to offer federal judges the opportunity to observe the effect 
of camera coverage and broadcasting of proceedings in federal 
court the panel wrote 
the experiment to begin in july 1991 if approved would be 
limited to two federal appeals courts and six trial courts judges 
would have to volunteer their courtrooms for the experiment and 
they would have broad discretion to refuse limit or terminate 
media coverage of an entire case portions thereof or testimony of 
particular witnesses the panel suggested 
it said 44 states permit in varying degrees camera coverage of 
their judicial proceedings and that most began or are continuing on 
an experimental basis 
the nation is on the brink of a major victory for openness in 
the federal court system rep robert w kastenmeier dwis 
said after the committee report was made public last month 
kastenmeier heads a house judiciary subcommittee that helps oversee 
the courts 
the committees recommendation is excellent said timothy 
dyk a lawyer for news organizations lobbying for cameras in court 
it really proposes a very significant experiment 
no serious problems have been reported in state courts that have 
allowed cameras say dyk and other advocates but until now that 
has not been enough to overcome the resistance of federal judges 
some have said they worry about losing their anonymity that 
lawyers will engage in grandstanding or that television will 
provide only snippets that will distort the proceedings 
whatever the outcome wednesday when the judicial conference 
studies the peckham committee plan supreme court proceedings are 
not likely to be primetime fare anytime soon 
the conference has no control over what the high court does and 
the justices generally have been hostile to television cameras in 
their courtroom 
sources at the high court say the justices were turned off to 
the idea after watching supreme court nominee robert bork get 
roughed up verbally at televised confirmation hearings before the 
senate judiciary committee in 1987 bork subsequently was rejected 
by the senate 
still justice anthony m kennedy the courts newest member 
told a group of visiting high school students last spring that 
televising high court proceedings is inevitable

an infant asleep on a couch a business 
executive speaking on a pay phone a tourist standing on a subway 
platform a 78yearold man out for an evening walk a prosecutor 
buying doughnuts 
in the violent summer of 1990 they were among hundreds of 
murder victims in new york city memorial day arrived with the 
zodiac killer the labor day weekend ended with a tourist from utah 
stabbed to death in the subway while defending his mother from 
muggers 
the three months in between continued a fiveyear trend of 
escalating summer violence experts said killings continued at a 
record pace as the city appeared headed for a new homicide record 
of more than 2000 for the year 
clearly this is the worst of times the numbers are higher 
than ever for murders said thomas reppetto head of the watchdog 
citizens crime commission 
this has got to be the worst summer since the son of sam in 
1977 said james deady a new yorker for 27 years and that was a 
serial killer this is much more wanton 
six out of 10 new yorkers say they would live elsewhere if they 
could and threequarters describe the city as dangerous and dirty 
according to a time magazinecable news network poll released 
sunday 
new york historically and statistically is a violent place 
the average day sees five murders nine rapes 256 robberies 332 
burglaries and 367 auto thefts 
walt whitman writing 150 years ago warned new york is one 
of the most crimehaunted and dangerous cities in christendom 
but this summer violence was as constant as the heat victims 
were chosen by their birth signs or their clothes panhandlers 
turned ugly if turned down children asleep in their homes or cars 
became shooting victims muggers killed cab drivers at the rate of 
nearly three a month 
i get the sense it was a more violent summer that usual i 
think the fact that children were killed that an assistant da in 
the bronx was killed these are people you dont expect to get 
caught in the crossfire said barbara raffel price dean of 
graduate studies at john jay college of criminal justice 
the summer started with a cryptic note found beside a 
78yearold shooting victim zodiac time to die it read 
joseph proce who was out for a late night walk died 24 days after 
the may 31 shooting 
the zodiac also shot three people who survived then the 
mysterious killer disappeared and headlines were taken over by the 
dartman between june 26 and a july 12 arrest of a suspect an 
assailant used a blowgun to fire small homemade darts at 55 women 
in midtown manhattan 
a rash of fatal shootings involving children had mayor david 
dinkins on the defensive around the same time four children age 9 
months to 9 years were shot to death in eight days at the end of 
july 
on sunday dinkins spoke at st patricks cathedral to ask new 
yorkers to come out from behind locked doors to battle violence 
in the citys streets 
come out and put your eyes and ears on the streets come out 
to help stop the violence said dinkins who joined cardinal john 
oconnor at mass 
on july 31 a television executive was shot to death while 
making a call at a greenwich village pay phone authorities say he 
was shot by a homeless man reportedly incensed by his rebuff of a 
request for spare change 
august concluded with a double shot of violence a prosecutor 
was killed by a stray bullet as he bought doughnuts in the bronx 
and a former state senator was shot to death in his brooklyn office 
on aug 30 
three days later brian watkins 22 of provo utah in town to 
see the us open tennis tournament was stabbed to death in a 
manhattan subway station while defending his mother from muggers 
that slaying reinforced the perception of outoftowners that new 
york is out of control 
its over for new york a fact that becomes clearer with each 
passing year wrote nationally syndicated columnist bob greene 
the cranky cabdriver and the impatient waiter seem like 
charming artifacts out of a 1950s musical about new york he 
wrote they have been replaced by the gangs with the box cutters 
and the crack addicts roaming the filthy streets 
reppetto called the subway slaying an almost apocryphal tale of 
new yorks evils a midamerican family comes to new york to 
attend a great world sporting event his mother is attacked and 
hes killed in the most brutal fashion defending her 
the da getting shot that tennis guy its sick i couldnt 
believe it said andy donnelly a financial analyst who moved to 
manhattan in july its like the wild west out there

her toothpickthin legs tears at her lissette rodriguez thinks of 
heaven 
when mom dies i die everyone dies i can walk in there 
she says in her frail voice no pain in my stomach no pain in my 
knee and i walk again 
sometimes her chest feels so tight she cant breathe 
sometimes those who love her cant hold her because her 40pound 
body is so brittle that she bleeds inside 
in these excruciating moments sandy as she is nicknamed 
prays she asks god to take the pain away 
barely 12 years old sandy is dying of aids for her death is 
represented by the concept of heaven where everything is beautiful 
you close your eyes and your body is not working she says

territories 
sandy was born four weeks prematurely in new york city the 
woman she knows as her mother carmen candelaria is really her 
aunt mrs candelaria took sandy and another child from her own 
sister when they were born because the sister was unable to care 
for them 
sandy contracted aids through a blood transfusion needed because 
of her early birth mrs candelaria said the girls natural mother

to god 
mrs candelaria threw a big barbecue may 1 for sandys 12th 
birthday and invited the people at the hospital who care for her 
sandy who weighed 60 pounds then mustered the strength to blow 
out the candles and got icing on her nose 
she celebrated her first communion not in a church but in the 
hospital where she returned at the end of may when her condition 
worsened 
for mrs candelaria it was bittersweet she is tormented by the 
picture in her mind she is unable to shake the image of a little 
girl with brown hair and eyes white lace dress and stockings 
locket around her tiny neck in a wheelchair surrounded by nurses 
a cake decorated with the sentiments jesus loves lissette we 
do too 
i just got sad said mrs candelaria i wanted it to be 
not in the hospital but a real normal communion she told me not 
to cry if i cry shell cry they both cried

moment even sleeping with her mrs candelaria is her shadow and 
has devoted much of her life to caring for her 
she is mrs candelarias protector never talking to her about 
the inevitable 
she knows mrs candelaria said she never talks to me 
about dying she sees me cry too many times 
each day brings a new onslaught of pain for sandy diarrhea 
coughing fever fungus itching her blackandblue body is 
replenished with new blood every month transfusions to keep her 
alive and platelets to help stem the diseases tide 
a hug a kiss a banged foot can start internal bleeding 
i have a pain in here sandy says rubbing her stomach 
sometimes i throw it up sometimes i get mad at doreen 
doreen small her devoted nurse said sandy always fights with 
her 
then she says shes sorry im the focus of her anger which 
is ok when shes in a good mood shell paint pictures for me i 
have a bunch of pictures 
a luxury for sandy is to have her feet rubbed she asks anyone 
who is handy to accommodate her when her cousin lues rivera 
jokingly threatened to stop one day she teased him in spanish i 
dare you 
sandy is a prisoner of her bed cared for at home by her mother 
and the center for hope hospice 
dont put me in there yet she orders ms small afraid she 
may never get back out to do all the things she wants 
her bedroom is filled with a cabinet of survival gear sterile 
water saline gauze diapers dressing kits needles to flush her 
iv 
her link to life is a catheter that enters her chest nourishing 
her with food vitamins minerals and dextrose the thrush 
infection from her mouth to her stomach and the medicine have 
killed her appetite 
sometimes the food at the hospital i dont like it she 
says a treat for her is pizza and french fries but she can handle 
only a few bites 
her constant companions are her friend poopy who takes her 
shopping a doll called baby bubbles whom she hugs and rocks and 
the telephone she frequently calls poopy to take her shopping and 
to chitchat i want to see my grandmother and cousin you see 
the movie mermaid i like the sound 
when you think how limited her life is thats her only 
contact to the outside world said ms small 
her dreams are simple to get out of her bed to go to school 
to see her classmates and the new kids on the block to have 
another party to fly to puerto rico to visit her grandmother to 
see the clouds from the plane

here is the text of the joint statement 
issued by president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
sunday at the close of their summit 
with regard to iraqs invasion and continued military 
occupation of kuwait president bush and president gorbachev issue 
the following joint statement 
we are united in the belief that iraqs aggression must not be 
tolerated no peaceful international order is possible if larger 
states can devour their smaller neighbors 
we reaffirm the joint statement of our foreign ministers of 
aug 3 1990 and our support for united nations security council 
resolutions 660 661 662 664 and 665 
today we once again call upon the government of iraq to 
withdraw unconditionally from kuwait to allow the restoration of 
kuwaits legitimate government and to free all hostages now held 
in iraq and kuwait 
nothing short of the complete implementation of the united 
nations security council resolutions is acceptable 
nothing short of a return to the preaugust 2 status of kuwait 
can end iraqs isolation 
we call upon the entire world community to adhere to the 
sanctions mandated by the united nations and we pledge to work 
individually and in concert to insure full compliance with the 
sanctions at the same time the united states and the soviet union 
recognize that un security council resolution 661 permits in 
humanitarian circumstances the importation into iraq and kuwait of 
food the sanctions committee will make recommendations to the 
security council on what would constitute humanitarian 
circumstances the united states and the soviet union further agree 
that any such imports must be strictly monitored by the appropriate 
international agencies to ensure that food reaches only those for 
whom it is intended with special priority being given to meeting 
the needs of children 
our preference is to resolve the crisis peacefully and we 
will be united against iraqs aggression as long as the crisis 
exists however we are determined to see this aggression end and 
if the current steps fail to end it we are prepared to consider 
additional ones consistent with the un charter we must 
demonstrate beyond any doubt that aggression cannot and will not 
pay 
as soon as the objectives mandated by the un security 
council resolutions mentioned above have been achieved and we have 
demonstrated that aggression does not pay the presidents direct 
their foreign ministers to work with countries in the region and 
outside it to develop regional security structures and measures to 
promote peace and stability it is essential to work actively to 
resolve all remaining conflicts in the middle east and persian 
gulf both sides will continue to consult each other and initiate 
measures to pursue these broader objectives at the proper time

here is the transcript of the news 
conference by president bush and soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev after their summit meeting sunday 
bush well ive been advised that im to take the first 
question and if so i would identify helen thomas of the up 
q id like to ask both presidents whether we are going to have 
a war in the persian gulf and id like to follow up 
bush well with your permission mr president i hope that we 
can achieve a peaceful solution and the way to do that is to have 
iraq comply with the united nations resolutions and i think that 
part of our joint statement two short lines said it most clearly 
nothing short of the complete implementation of united nations 
security council resolutions is acceptable as soon as saddam 
hussein realizes that then there certainly will be a peaceful 
resolution to this question 
q how about president gorbachev what do you think 
gorbachev in replying to your question i should like to say 
that the whole of our seven hours of meeting today were devoted to 
the quest for a political resolution of that conflict and i 
believe that were on the right road 
q mr president if i may follow up with you president bush 
you are indicating that hostilities could break out if this is not 
resolved peacefully 
bush the question is what 
q i said you are indicating that there could be hostilities 
bush the united states is determined to see these resolutions 
enforced and i like to feel that they will be enforced and that 
that will result in a peaceful resolution 
q my question to mr president my name is panyi do you 
think mr president that the conflict of the gulf gives the 
opportunity to solve the palestinian problem through an 
international peace conference for the middle east and my second 
question is if this problem was discussed today with mr gorbachev 
bush well let me say that i see the implementation of the 
united nations resolutions separate and apart from the need to 
solve the other question that question has been on the agenda of 
many countries for many years and it is very important that that 
question be resolved the secretary of state said the other day 
and i strongly support that that under certain circumstances the 
consideration of a conference of that nature would be acceptable 
indeed its been a part of our policy from time to time but the 
thing that i feel strongly about is that these issues are not 
linked and any effort to link them is an effort to dilute the 
resolutions of the united nations 
q a question to president bush from soviet radio and 
television how long will united states be troops be present in 
the persian gulf area 
bush they will be present in the area until we are satisfied 
that the security needs of the area have been met and that these 
resolutions have been complied with and the sooner they are out of 
there as far as i am concerned the better i made very clear to 
president gorbachev as i think he will confirm that we have no 
intention keeping them a day longer than is required and so id 
leave it right there 
q tom raum with the associated press 
gorbachev id like to add something and to confirm what the 
president of the united states has just said to me in our 
conversation that the united states of america do not intend to 
leave their forces in the zone and in connection with the change 
or the normalization of the situation the united states 
administration and personally the president will do everything 
possible to ensure that the forces are withdrawn from the region 
from the zone and thats a very important statement 
q i have a question for both presidents the unity that youre 
expressing today doesnt ignore the fact that there are still some 
irritants between the two countries president bush are you more 
sympathetic now to suggestions of western economic aid to the 
soviet union and president gorbachev would you be willing to 
withdraw soviet military advisers from iraq 
bush for my part i am very much interested in assisting to be 
sure that perestroika is successful we indeed have a mission of 
highlevel businessmen on their way to the soviet union right now 
they happen to be in helsinki this is but one manifestation of the 
fact that we are trying to encourage economic cooperation in as 
many ways as possible and we had a good long discussion in our 
expanded meeting this afternoon about that and i i am given the 
the common stand that the soviet union and the united states have 
taken at the united nations it seems to me that we should be as 
forthcoming as we possibly can in terms of economics and i plan to 
do that 
there are certain constraints as you say there are certain 
nuances of difference there are certain differences real 
differences but on the other hand i have said before and ill 
repeat it here in front of all this journalists from all around 
the world we of course want perestroika to succeed it is an 
internal matter of the soviet union but i think this remarkable 
cooperation that has been demonstrated by the soviet union at the 
united nations gets me inclined to recommend as close cooperation 
in the economic field as possible and i will be saying this to the 
congress when i get back 
we still have problems look weve got some big problems 
ourselves in our economy and we are not in the position operating 
at the enormous deficits to write out large checks having said 
that there are many ways that we can endeavor to be of assistance 
to the emerging economy in the soviet union

gorbachev and there was a question also addressed to me i 
would like nevertheless on the question which did appear also to 
be addressed to me the western assistance to the soviet i would 
like to continue the conversation with president bush is 
continuing on the western assistance to the soviet union i see 
that there is an attempt being made to establish a link between 
this and disagreements or the lack of disagreements and in 
response to that i would say the following 
we began our conversation today together by reviewing the 
situation and realizing that the whole of world society and our two 
great states are undergoing a trial this is a test of the 
durability of the new approach to resolving world problems 
and as we enter upon a new peaceful period and as we emerge from 
the cold war we see that no less inaudible are necessary in 
order to find ways and means in this period of peace to meet the 
new situation and to tackle all problems that may arise 
i think if it hadnt been for malta it would have been very 
difficult for us to act in the very difficult situation which arose 
in eastern europe in europe and in the situation connected with 
the unification of germany i think that if following that there 
hadnt been washington and camp david and the other meetings on 
this level with other partners in international relations we would 
now be in a difficult situation facing the crisis in the persian 
gulf 
and the fact that today we have taken a common approach to such 
difficult problems problems which may well have tragic 
consequences for the whole world not just for the peoples of that 
region demonstrates that we still are moving forward in the right 
direction and that we are capable of resolving the most difficult 
and the most acute problems and to find appropriate responses to 
the challenges of our time and the greater part of our 
conversation together was devoted to this 
and i believe that this is the most important point to bear in 
mind differences nuances in the differences of view arguments 
these can be these are natural its natural that those should 
arise but what we have seen today is that we have confirmed the 
most important progress of recent time now i should like to say 
something about the iraqi question but in fact i havent quite 
finished on the first subject 
i wouldnt want president bushs reply to give rise to the 
opinion that the soviet union is going to align with a certain 
behavior we are acting in a difficult situation we are finding a 
solution we shall find a solution which will be satisfactory and 
above all which will remove the danger of an explosion 
and this is becoming a normal element of the new kind of 
cooperation in trade in technology and human exchange all of 
these elements characterize the new peaceful period upon which we 
are just now embarked and which we have to get used to 
it would be very oversimplified and very superficial to judge 
that the soviet union could be bought for dollars because although 
we do look forward to cooperation in this very serious time of 
farreaching changes in our economy and thats normal lets 
remember the reforms of recent years in a number of states they 
always in addition to the principal efforts made by the peoples 
concerned themselves they always involved also the participation 
of the world community in one form of another so if anybody wants 
to try to impose a different view thats unacceptable to us its 
unacceptable to the united states its unacceptable to the soviet 
union and it would be unacceptable to any other state 
now to move on to the second part of your question concerning 
our experts in iraq they are not so much advisers as specialists 
or experts who are working under contract and their number is 
being reduced whereas at the beginning of the conflict i think 
there were still 196 of them there are now some 150 of them and 
the iraqi leadership looks upon the matter thus that if they 
havent completed their work their normal work under contract 
even though it may be a matter of weapons then they are 
nevertheless leaving iraq and the process is going forward so i 
dont really think theres a problem 
q izvestia question to both presidents did you discuss any 
possible military options for curbing iraqi aggression and what 
would be the conditions and what would be the point where you 
would consider that the political options were exhausted and it was 
time to go to the security council and talk about through the 
security council demanding an iraqi withdrawal from kuwait 
bush the answer to your question is no we did not discuss 
military options and your question is too hypothetical 
and i would like to see this matter peacefully resolved 
gorbachev i would like to support what was said by president 
bush and i stress once more that the whole of our time together 
was spent on talking about this conflict in a mutual search for a 
political solution and i think we can look with optimism in the 
final analysis on the efforts being taken by the international 
community working together within the security council at the un

q mikhail sergeyevich you were just saying that if iraq 
doesnt withdraw its forces peacefully then it will be necessary 
to take military steps what kind of soviet contribution will there 
be to those military steps and what will happen then to the soviet 
citizens who are in iraq now and what will the arab factor be 
gorbachev firstly i did not say that if iraq does not withdraw 
peacefully were going to have recourse to military methods i did 
not state that i do not state that and moreover in my view that 
would draw us into consequences which we cant at this stage 
forecast and therefore our country and the united nations as a 
whole has a whole range of possibilities of finding a political 
solution to this problem therefore i would limit ourselves to 
that and therefore the second part of your question is irrelevant 
q if i could ask president gorbachev specifically iraq had 
been your ally what directly have you done in contact with saddam 
hussein to reverse the situation there and president bush what 
specifically have you asked mr gorbachev to do directly have you 
asked him to make a direct contact with saddam hussein 
gorbachev i should say that from the start of the crisis weve 
been actively exchanging views and carrying forth dialogue not only 
within the security council not only with the administration of 
the usa these types of contact have great importance to us but we 
are also holding active dialogue with leadership of china of 
india of all the other european states especially those which are 
members of the security council and in my view its this dialogue 
which has helped us towards the security council resolution which 
was passed 
on top of that we are also actively cooperating with the arab 
states the countries of the arab world and here our dialogue is 
no less intensive than with our partners in the countries i 
previously mentioned including dialogue with president hussein 
and i can state that what we have announced publicly is also 
being said to president hussein in our dialogue with him which all 
means that the president and the leadership of iraq are expected to 
show a reasonable approach to stop and to understand what is 
implied by the position taken by the security council on this issue 
this is the dialogue which we have undertaken with him and we 
are trying to make sure that our arguments are convincing we 
discussed various options for ending the situation with him and we 
are also attempting as i already said to make it quite clear to 
saddam hussein that if iraq were to provoke military action then 
the result would be a tragedy first and foremost for the iraqi 
people themselves for the whole of the region and for the whole of 
the world 
you know this is of course a dialogue in a very difficult 
situation but we consider it a very useful dialogue and we dont 
exclude the possibility of establishing new contacts of having new 
meetings at various levels and the type of communication which we 
have had up until now with the iraqis gives us hope that those 
links we have with them can be used positively for the sake of all 
of us for the sake of finding a peaceful solution to this problem 
and especially of preventing the situation turning into aggression 
in this situation 
bush my inaudible would simply be that there is no need 
to ask mr gorbachev to contact saddam hussein clearly from his 
answer you can see that they have been in contact 
interpreter the president cannot be heard the microphone 
seems to be off 
bush not working 
interpreter the president could not be heard for a few 
seconds there the microphone was off 
bush is that better well 
gorbachev its a little better but hit it again 
bush chuckles president gorbachev answered the question 
about the contact with saddam hussein and clearly your question to 
me is have i asked him to contact saddam hussein the answer is 
no but the soviet union is in contact he himself received the 
foreign minister aziz but i would just simply sum it up by saying 
the best answer to saddam hussein or the best contact is the 
contact that took place at the united nations when there was 
worldwide condemnation of the aggression 
and i happen to feel that this statement showing the soviet 
union and the united states in essential agreement here is another 
good statement for saddam hussein and hopefully he will see that 
he is not going to divide us and divide other countries and that he 
will do what he should have done some time ago and that is comply 
with the united nations sanctions so but i did not ask him to do 
that because theyre way ahead of us on that they are having 
contacts and trying to be helpful in that regard 
q pravda i have a question to mr bush mr president what is 
your position on the question of signing a treaty limiting 
strategic offensive weapons 
and when do you think that such a treaty will in fact be signed 
bush we still remain committed to a strategic arms treaty we 
vowed that we would encourage our negotiators to move forward more 
rapidly on both the strategic arms treaty and the conventional 
force agreement and im still hopeful that by the end of the year 
we will have such an agreement 
interpreter microphone please for mr gorbachev 
gorbachev should i hit it again i think its working id like 
to confirm what president bush has just said that we really have 
agreed to make fresh efforts to give further instructions because 
we see that there is a possibility successfully to complete the 
negotiating process in those two fora and to come up with positive 
results in the course of this year

q good evening doris akatarian from palestine news agency 
wafa my question is for president bush and i would also like to 
hear president gorbachevs comments on that president bush 
mentioned that you failed to see the link between the palestinian 
question and the present situation i would like to know how come 
it is so important to implement un resolutions in this particular 
instance when other standing ones have been frozen and overlooked 
and disregarded for so long so id like to know how come this 
aggression is so different from other ones and i would also like 
to add that i personally feel that the palestinian dilemma and 
question need the attention of the superpowers more than ever 
thank you very much 
bush i agree that it needs it and we are very much interested 
in implementing resolution 242 of the united nations weve been 
zealously trying to do that as have many other powers for many 
years but the fact that that resolution hasnt been fulfilled when 
it calls for withdrawal to secure and recognized boundaries and it 
should be and hopefully we can be catalytic in seeing that happen 
does not mean that you sit idly by in the face of a naked 
aggression against kuwait 
and the united nations has moved and the united nations 
resolutions should be implemented on their face without trying to 
tie it into some other unresolved dispute but i couldnt agree 
more that it is important it is very important that that question 
eventually and hopefully sooner than later be resolved 
gorbachev i think that everything that is taking place in the 
middle east is a matter of concern to us of equal concern and 
even more than in the case of the persian gulf we need to act more 
energetically in order to resolve the complex of problems in the 
middle east and to come up with decisions and to devise a system 
to devise guarantees that would ensure the interests of all peoples 
and of the whole world community because its a matter which is of 
vital concern to all of us and it seems to me that there is a link 
here because the failure to find a solution in the middle east at 
large also has a bearing on the acuteness of the particular 
conflict weve been talking about here 
q a question for both presidents please in your statement 
you pledged to work individually and in concert to ensure full 
compliance with the un sanctions against iraq may i inquire what 
if any specific and concrete steps you have agreed to take in 
furtherance of that 
bush we didnt agree to specific and concrete steps i think 
president gorbachev in the contacts hes had with saddam hussein 
and if i mean with the iraqis and if they continue will be a 
step in that direction clearly this message itself will be a step 
in that direction but we did not sit at this meeting and try to 
assign each other or ask each other to undertake specific measures 
in keeping with that particular paragraph 
gorbachev id like to add to that that the emphasis here is on 
the significance of the political fact that we feel necessary to 
reflect in this statement which testifies to our political will to 
act jointly or in parallel independently really in search of 
these new steps towards a peaceful resolution of the problem i 
think that for the meeting and the document that weve just adopted 
is more important than our enumerating various steps that might 
have been taken here that forms the basis for the further active 
quest for solutions 
q soviet tass agency i also have a question to the presidents 
of both countries mr president mr gorbachev first of all 
since the last meeting it seems to be that youve had a good 
mutual understanding have you succeeded in deepening that mutual 
understanding in the course of todays meeting and how in general 
what bearing in general is that factor having on the results of 
your negotiations 
bush well i think clearly there has been a developing mutual 
understanding over the years i like to feel and i think president 
gorbachev agrees that our meeting in malta had something to do 
with furthering that understanding im convinced that our meeting 
in the united states at camp david particularly furthered that 
understanding but im not i think the world sees clearly that if 
this had occurred 20 years ago there wouldnt have been this 
cooperative feeling at the united nations and i think its very 
important 
so i dont know how one quantifies mutual understanding but i 
feel were moving on the right track neither of us when we talk 
try to hide our differences neither of us try to indicate that we 
look at exactly every problem exactly the same way but the very 
fact we can talk with that degree of frankness without rancor i 
think enhances mutual understanding 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO> AP900910-0014 </DOCNO>
<TEXT>
and then when we see us on a question of this nature standing 
shoulder to shoulder with many other countries at the united 
nations i think it is obvious manifestation of this developing 
mutual understanding its a very broad philosophical question but 
differences still remain but the common ground in my view at 
least surges ahead of these differences and we will continue to 
cooperate with president gorbachev 
gorbachev i dont know if i would be allowed to tell you a 
secret here i havent asked president bush if hell let me but i 
must admit that im dying to take the risk and tell you but its 
too important to give you an answer to this particular question 
but that last sentence does really give me the hope that well get 
by in our talks the president said you know there was a long 
time when our view was that the soviet union had nothing to do in 
the middle east there was had no business being there this 
was something that we had to talk through during this meeting here 
in helsinki and what was said here is that its very important for 
us to cooperate in the middle east just as it is on other issues 
of world politics so that is an answer to your question 
it is very important that at each meeting we move forward we 
enrich our relationship and i think i should say that we increase 
our trust if trust is engendered between the leaders of two such 
nations during meetings of this kind then im sure youll agree 
with me that that is to the good of all of us whether we want it 
or not history dictates that a lot is going to depend on whether 
the two countries can work together thats not our ambition its 
just the way that history has gone 
so far from excluding such a possibility we intend to cooperate 
with all sorts of other countries as well more and more thats 
how we see our role in the world developing 
and my last comment is also very important it seems to me that 
the way the world is the way the world is changing in todays 
world no single country however powerful will be able to provide 
the leadership which individual countries formerly tried to 
provide including some countries which are represented here we 
can only succeed if we work together and solve our problems 
together that is what is emerging from these negotiations and 
that we consider the most important aspect 
q mikhail sergeyevich from french television im going to 
speak french if i may could i ask mr gorbachev whether the soviet 
union is still iraqs friend as minister tariq aziz declared in 
moscow last week are you still the friend of saddam hussein 
and another question also directed to mr gorbachev president 
saddam hussein stated yesterday that the soviet union would 
demonstrate that it is a great power by resisting george bushs 
pressure and by supporting the baghdad regime could you indicate 
to me if you would what your reply would be to saddam hussein 
gorbachev i will reply to you and so i dont have to repeat it 
also to saddam hussein the same reply that ive given to previous 
questions my position is unchanged we see our role and our 
responsibility and within the framework of that responsibility we 
shall act in cooperation with the other members of the security 
council and in this instance i can once again say since we are 
sitting here two presidents together i shall interact and 
cooperate with the president of the united states id very much 
like to express the hope that president saddam hussein will display 
i really hope that he will will display sobriety will look 
carefully at the whole situation and will respond to the appeals 
and the demands of the world community and that he will take steps 
that are suitable to the situation that are carefully weighed in 
their worldwide implications and in their implications for the arab 
world too 
no one has any intention of trying to exclude iraq from the 
community of nations but what the present iraqi leadership is 
doing is driving into a dead end and i hope that president saddam 
hussein will heed this appeal to him 
q id like to ask mr gorbachev if you have ruled out the 
possibility of a soviet military participation in this effort in 
any sense either as part of the naval blockade or as part of some 
future peacekeeping force in the region 
and i would follow up with a question to mr bush to what 
degree that would be a disappointment to you if if thats mr 
gorbachevs position 
gorbachev i dont see the point of doing that now and we shall 
continue to act in cooperation within the security council and in 
strict compliance with all of its decisions

bush im not disappointed in that answer laughter 
q you said youre determined to see this aggression end and 
current steps are being considered what does this mean what comes 
next 
bush its too hypothetical we want to see the message get 
through to saddam hussein we want to see him do what the united 
nations calls on him to do and that statement can be interpreted 
any way you want to interpret it but its out there and i would 
simply not go into any hypothetical questions that would lead me 
beyond what that statement says 
gorbachev please if you would excuse me ill add a couple of 
words just to what mr bush has already said 
you know in my view i have the impression that both the press 
and public opinion in some countries is in some ways saying that 
theres a lack of decision on somebodys part that were 
withdrawing in the face of those who are trampling on international 
law i cannot agree with that view in fact its a view which 
causes a certain amount of embarrassment to the leadership of 
nations which are acting through the security council in this 
respect 
what has been done up till now in answer to iraqi aggression is 
very important because action has been taken not only within the 
framework of the security council but there has been unanimous 
world opinion a kind of solidarity which has never been expressed 
before in the history of the world and we have prevented the 
aggression going any further we have preserved the functioning of 
the structures which are of economic importance which would affect 
so many other countries as well and finally the resolution has 
been taken on an embargo which is a very stiff measure in 
reaction to the aggression 
in my view this is a strategic way of tackling the question 
which has been tackled successfully at the first stages and we are 
convinced that the next stage of a political solution achieved 
politically to put an end to this acute international crisis and 
make sure that a political settlement should be possible that in 
this situation decisiveness willpower and responsibility and 
political faith in the possibility of a political solution to this 
very difficult issue shows that the political leaders of the world 
are being responsible to their own nations and to the world and we 
do not want to get caught up in arguments about prestige and so on 
q from the finnish television concerning the humanitarian aid 
does your joint statement mean in practice that you consider that 
food should be now allowed to iraq 
gorbachev the presidents feel it necessary to reflect in our 
joint declaration that we see the need to uphold what was decided 
by the security council on this subject and the security council 
was prepared to admit for humanitarian purposes the supply of 
medicines and of foodstuffs required first and foremost for 
children weve actually stated this quite plainly in our 
statement and so weve taken a very clearcut position on that 
but weve also made it clear this must take place within the 
framework of certain international organizations and being 
monitored by them at stages in the operation so i think that this 
has been stated in the correct terms 
bush off mike president gorbachev on that point and that 
the language is very good because it does express the concern that 
both countries feel in the event there actually are children and 
others who are suffering because of lack of food 
i hope that nobody around the world interprets this as our view 
that now there should be wholesale food shipments to iraq because i 
can speak only here for the united states when i would call 
attention to the fact that we need some kind of international 
agencies to see that there is this humanitarian concern as 
expressed this exception in the united nations embargo for 
humanitarian purposes and not only is it required for this 
humanitarian circumstance but that the food gets where it is 
supposed to go 
so this should not be from the us standpoint interpreted as a 
wholesale big hole in this embargo it was not our intention and i 
think the language is very clear on that point 
q a few things if you could clear up for us first of all you 
seem to disagree on the military option and when you talk about 
further steps being taken to implement the un sanctions 
president bush you seem to be saying the military option is still 
out there president gorbachev seems to disagree do you disagree 
on that did you ask president gorbachev to pull his experts out of 
iraq and did you ask him to send troops into the gulf region 
bush i did not ask him to send troops in if the soviets 
decided to do that at the invitation of the saudis that would be 
fine with us but i did not ask him to do that i believe there 
with the 23 countries that are participating on the ground or 23 
countries that are participating on the ground and at sea that the 
security of saudi arabia is close to safeguarded what were the 
other two points

permitting humanitarian shipments of food to 
iraq and kuwait may open the door to broader violations of a un 
trade embargo but the leakage is likely to be small us analysts 
and officials say 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev agreed 
at their helsinki summit sunday to allow food shipments to iraq and 
occupied kuwait in humanitarian circumstances 
they said the united nations whose security council voted aug 
6 to embargo all trade with iraq because it had invaded kuwait four 
days earlier would define the special circumstances shipments 
would be monitored by international agencies 
bush apparently worried that sundays announcement would be 
seen as a weakening of us resolve against iraq said i hope 
that nobody around the world interprets this as our view that now 
there should be wholesale food shipments to iraq 
he is banking on the embargo to force iraqi president saddam 
hussein to withdraw from kuwait 
bush previously had refused to publicly endorse humanitarian aid 
to iraq although other nations have sought to force his hand on 
this issue china and iran said in recent days that they were 
willing to help arrange emergency shipments of food and medicine 
saddam in recent public statements has accused the president of 
trying to starve iraqi children and vowed that foreigners being 
held in iraq and kuwait would share in any deprivations caused by 
the un sanctions 
in washington initial reaction suggested bushs move in 
helsinki would be seen as a concession even though the un 
resolution specifically says that medical supplies and in 
humanitarian circumstances food would be exempt from the embargo 
thats a little crack in the embargo sen bob dole of 
kansas the senate republican leader said on abctvs this week 
with david brinkley 
private us analysts said allowing certain food and medical 
supplies into iraq and kuwait was likely to invite more widespread 
cheating on the trade embargo 
it obviously will be an excuse for a little bit more 
leakage said judith kipper a middle east scholar at the 
brookings institution in washington she added however that 
its the lack of cash and spare parts for machinery that are 
more important in determining whether saddam backs off 
james a phillips deputy director of foreign policy studies at 
the heritage foundation said cutting off iraqs oil income by 
prohibiting petroleum exports is the key to ensuring that saddam is 
unable to buy his way around the sanctions 
iraq would have a difficult time paying for enough food or 
other supplies to improve appreciably its ability to hold out 
against the embargo phillips said 
in a joint statement issued at the close of their meeting bush 
and gorbachev said they were united in seeking to enforce the un 
embargo and pressure saddam to withdraw from kuwait and release all 
foreign hostages 
at the same time the united states and the soviet union 
recognize that un security council resolution 661 permits in 
humanitarian circumstances the importation into iraq and kuwait of 
food the statement said 
the two leaders said a un committee would advise the security 
council on what would constitute humanitarian circumstances they 
said any food shipments should be monitored by unspecified 
international agencies to ensure that food reaches only those for 
whom it is intended with special priority being given to meeting 
the needs of children 
it was not immediately clear which international organizations 
might be involved 
in washington a red cross official said that organization would 
not help monitor humanitarian shipments until iraq allows red cross 
officials to meet with civilians there 
ann stingle a spokeswoman said the international committee of 
the red cross last week was denied permission by iraq to provide 
assistance to several groups including western hostages 
nonwesterners authorized to leave iraq but not able to do so 
iraqi and kuwaiti civilians and kuwaiti prisoners of war 
until we have access we would not be able to participate in 
a unsponsored humanitarian aid effort mrs stingle said

q did you ask him to pull the experts out of iraq and do you 
disagree on the use of military force you seem to say its still 
an option he seems to say its not an option ever 
bush we may have a difference on that im just as i think 
ive answered over and over again at home im not going to 
discuss what i will or wont do and president gorbachev made an 
eloquent appeal with which i agree that a peaceful solution is 
the best so ive left it open he can comment on the other but i 
and again john im sorry the second point 
q the experts pulling the experts out 
bush well i think it would facilitate things but on the other 
hand hes given his answer here and that is not a major irritant 
youve said that hes already i think he said that he is reducing 
the numbers there but i think i tried to make clear that this was 
a question that was widely being raised in the united states and 
it would facilitate things if they were out of there in terms of 
total understanding but i heard his answer listened to it very 
very carefully and i must say that i would let it stand at that 
if i was just saying would i like to see them all out of 
there i think id say absolutely but id let him add to that 
gorbachev in answer to all these questions which you gave us 
such a clear list of ive already given answers i really dont 
have anything to add to the answers ive already given 
q al ahram newspaper of cairo egypt question to the two 
presidents please you mentioned something about the security 
arrangement is the soviet union going to participate in any kind 
of security arrangement and what is the role of the region and the 
countries of that region of the middle east 
gorbachev on the first question as we began we intend to 
continue to cooperate closely and actively in the framework of the 
security council and on the basis of the decisions that have been 
adopted we shall act accordingly thats the first point 
secondly as concerns the role of the countries of the region 
yes i think that generally speaking i would stress the importance 
of the arab factor not yet really hadnt been brought to bear in 
efforts to help resolve this crisis situation 
i dont want to offer you our analysis right now as to why 
thats the case but nevertheless i am convinced that there is an 
obvious activization of the quest on the part of arab states to 
find the response to the urgent situation which faces us faces us 
all here we cooperate with all the arab countries and i might say 
not unusefully the outlines of possible steps are beginning to 
emerge but it is too soon to be specific we are continuing our 
cooperation with arab countries and at a certain stage when the 
situation has changed and has been somewhat when the tension has 
been reduced then perhaps we might carry this further 
but we shall continue in the security council the permanent 
members of the security council to guarantee security i have no 
doubt that we shall succeed in resolving the problem by political 
means 
bush may i comment on that one please i am very glad that the 
arab states at the arab league and in other ways have stated 
their condemnation of saddam hussein he is trying to make this a 
contest between the arab world and the united states 
and it is no such thing if you will look at how the united 
nations has overwhelming condemned him 
so the arab states have a very key role in this many arab 
states have responded in the defense of saudi arabia syria 
morocco egypt to say nothing of the gcc countries so it is not 
saddam hussein and the arab world against the united states it is 
saddam hussein against the united nations and against a majority of 
the arab league and that is a very important point that i will 
continue to make because the arab league itself has stood up to him 
and urged his compliance with the sanctions and condemned his 
aggression 
so in this case i see the arab states as having a very important 
role to play in the resolution of this question and they have not 
been taken in by his attempt to make this the arab world versus the 
united states of america when it is nothing of the kind 
gorbachev i wanted the president and myself to conclude this 
press conference by expressing our deep sympathies and feelings for 
the people of finland for the hospitality extended to us on this 
soil and to appreciate highly the contribution made by the 
president of this country and his wife to have made these excellent 
arrangements for this meeting 
bush may i simply add that president koivisto and mrs koivisto 
have been most hospitable and i agree with this we owe them a 
great debt of gratitude and the people of finland thank you

no one likes the sergeant 
who could its his voice always in your ear like the georgia 
gnats that are in constant orbit around your head 
the voice runs you sometimes from 5 in the morning to midnight 
whenever you think youve caught a break and stretch out on your 
bunk here it comes again dragging you out of a sweaty sleep 
damn whats going on you dont need to be laying down 
sgt 1st class ronnie jacksons shout comes through the barracks 
screen door like a rocket get up we got things to do 
the short stocky commander of the 265th quartermaster 
detachment has been haranguing his men since they were mobilized 
for deployment to the mideast two weeks ago its his job to 
prepare the south carolina national guard water purification unit 
for the hot and potentially hostile desert 
the task is hard and not just because of the crowded training 
schedule or the exhausting heat the guardsmen face each day it is 
also complicated by personal histories jackson a 40yearold 
probation officer and high school sports referee has known nearly 
all 14 of the units men for years 
on the street back in their hometown of allendale sc hes 
just plain ronnie waving hello to henry or earnie or hullie but 
when the uniforms come on he becomes sgt jackson giving orders to 
spc harris and sgts deloach and cohen 
jackson has been the boss since 1982 he has been a member of 
the unit for 17 years a year less than three men he now orders 
around 
it took some getting used to but it had to be done said 
jackson its like refereeing basketball when you walk on the 
floor youve got to take charge 
jackson is in constant motion going from planning meeting to 
planning meeting wearing his combat equipment and carrying a 
briefcase a good percentage of his comments begin with damn 
it 
he is of course a constant target for the men any mistake is 
immediately and loudly corrected when the 40yearold jackson runs 
with the men in the morning many tease him about his endurance 
can you feel it sarge can you feel it asks 23yearold 
ulysses calhoun spinning effortlessly in place as jackson 
determinedly keeps up with the pace 
the men snicker when jackson has to stand on a box to use a 
computerized firing range but the sergeant quickly squeezes off 
round after round of hits he makes sure all the men are aware of 
his prowess 
one evening jackson joined the rest of the unit at the posts 
gym for a game of basketball the opposing side played a hard 
unrelenting game they argued with jackson over nearly every point 
when they won they were exultant 
but the sergeant knows when to back off 
after spending an afternoon in the hot sun the tired and 
frustrated men seemed ready for mutiny except they were too tired 
to make matters worse the schedule called for an evening of 
exhausting chemical warfare training 
the sergeant stayed clear of the men who were allowed to train 
at first aid and navigation instead 
youve got to know when to give them some room he said 
jackson clearly likes the mantle of authority active for years 
in the precincts democratic party he hopes to run for office when 
he returns home maybe for probate judge maybe for state 
representative 
he also hopes to move up in the guard he was set to go to first 
sergeant school before the unit was mobilized ultimately he hopes 
to become a sergeant major 
everybody respects you in that job he said i think i 
deserve that

public schools have begun teaching 
religion in this overwhelmingly roman catholic country prompting 
concern about the continued separation of church and state in 
postcommunist poland 
in the term that began this month the catholic religion is 
being taught two hours a week from kindergarten through high 
school replacing the former system of churchrun catechism schools 
attendance is optional and some other religions also are 
arranging classes but the governments decision has left many 
people uneasy noncatholics express fears their children will 
singled out and harassed by others because of their different 
beliefs 
intolerance is one thing we fear said zdzislaw slowinski a 
wroclaw polytechnic scientist second as we experienced before 
the war the church will impose its doctrines on the overall 
educational system 
slowinski who has four children is rallying likeminded 
parents against the classes he rejects organized religion and 
said his children already encounter hostility because they do not 
participate in church ceremonies 
newspaper letter columns have been filled with arguments for and 
against the classes 
most people who telephoned two callin radio shows on the first 
day of school opposed them some complained that parishioners paid 
to build church classrooms that will be unused because of the shift 
to public schools 
the catholic church made religion in the public schools one of 
its main goals after the communists fell from power last year 
cardinal jozef glemp the conservative head of the polish 
church has vigorously defended the religion classes and his 
priests promote them in their weekly homilies 
addressing 400000 faithful on aug 15 at the jasna gora 
monastery in czestochowa glemp blamed the old regime for current 
doubts about teaching religion in the schools 
in its struggle against religion the communist system managed 
to reduce it in the minds of many people to the rank of a private 
matter the cardinal said in reality religion is not a 
private matter faith requires a community 
the rev henryk jankowski pastor of st brygidas church in 
gdansk said in a recent interview should religious instruction 
in schools be restored the answer is definite schools are the 
property of the nation the polish nation is over 90 percent 
catholic 
jankowskis church is near the shipyard where solidarity was 
born in 1980 and became an unofficial headquarters of the union 
movement during the years it was banned 
an education ministry regulation providing for the classes 
issued aug 2 was drafted by a joint commission of the church and 
the solidarityled government of prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
a former catholic journalist 
priests nuns and lay teachers appointed by local bishops 
arrived at schools on opening day sept 3 
school principals and many other poles were caught by surprise 
there was no parliamentary debate and education ministry 
officials previously had spoken against religion classes room 
assignments and class schedules had been completed so school 
officials scrambled to find space and time for the extra sessions 
jacek ambroziak a government minister and cochairman of the 
joint commission noted that the classes were voluntary and 
declared the instruction does not impose anything on anyone or 
restrict anyones freedom of beliefs 
a commission statement urged tolerance and respect for people 
following a different philosophy 
about 36 million of polands 38 million people identify 
themselves as roman catholic the next largest group is eastern 
orthodox with about 1 million adherents concentrated in the 
eastern provinces 
among many smaller religious minorities are lutherans 
evangelicals jehovahs witnesses seventhday adventists mormons 
jews and even moslems descended from tatar invaders of the middle 
ages 
opposition comes from severql quarters 
freedom and peace a pacifistecological group oriented to the 
young has urged high school students to boycott the classes 
government ombudsman ewa letowska asked the constitutional 
tribunal the highest court for constitutional questions to 
determine whether the religion classes are legal without 
legislation her appeal is based in part on a 1961 law requiring 
schools to be nonreligious in character 
a survey by state television in late august indicated poles 
preferred the system of church schools by a margin of 59 percent to 
39 it involved 900 people nationwide with a 3 percent margin of 
error 
at the kindergarten and elementary level parents decide whether 
their children will attend the classes in high school either the 
student or parents can make the decision 
prayer is permitted at the beginning of the school day in the 
presence of all children including nonbelievers lay religious 
teachers will be paid by the schools but not members of the clergy 
leading noncatholic denominations endorsed the classes after 
some hesitation orthodox and protestant classes are being 
organized drawing pupils from several schools when necessary 
the catholic church argues that religion classes are merely a 
return to the situation before the communists religion was taught 
in schools until the early 1950s when the communists felt strong 
enough to clamp down on the church and imprisoned cardinal stefan 
wyszynski for three years 
after hardline stalinists were ousted in 1956 religion 
returned to the schools briefly until the education law of 1961 
the church then established its catechism schools which met after 
regular school or on weekends 
attendance at the church classes was nearly universal among 
catholics sending ones child was both an expression of faith and 
a patriotic defiance of the communists

two years ago it looked as if a vast part of 
the nations farm empire was burning up as drought and heat parched 
crops and livestock 
but the 1988 drought wasnt as bad as it might have been 
according to an agriculture department analysis crop yields 
plummeted but commodity prices rose for those who eked out some 
production or had grain stored from previous years it wasnt too 
bad 
the latest postmortem of the 1988 droughts effects was written 
by gerald w whittaker of the departments economic research 
service it concentrated on the most severe drought region 
centered in nine states of the midwest and upper great plains 
all of the information used in the study was from usdas annual 
farm costs and returns survey which includes detailed income and 
expense information derived from personal interviews of farm 
operators 
basic findings 
net farm income decreased in 1988 in the drought region to an 
average of 28899 per farm from 38122 in 1987 income in 
nondrought areas rose to 62822 in 1988 from 50967 in 1987 
as used by the agency net farm income includes gross income 
from farming during the calendar year including federal payments 
minus costs of production it also includes allowances for changes 
in the value of inventories and adjustments for depreciation and 
other factors 
despite drought farms in all areas of the country continued to 
improve their solvency position in 1988 
the number of farms considered financially vulnerable continued 
to decrease in 1988 in both the drought and nondrought regions 
farms in the drought region received lower direct government 
payments in 1988 despite an infusion of federal disaster relief 
the average farm in the drought region survived financially by 
selling off inventories and taking advantage of higher commodity 
market prices to redeem price support loans made by usdas 
commodity credit corp 
no statebystate breakdowns were included in the report the 
nine states studied as the drought region were illinois 
indiana iowa michigan minnesota montana north dakota south 
dakota and wisconsin 
in the category of net farm income the report said the share of 
farms in a favorable financial position in 1988 held fairly 
steady at 68 percent in the nondrought region compared with 691 
percent in 1987 
in the drought states 622 percent of the farms were said to be 
in favorable financial position compared with 628 percent in 1987 
even with lower incomes farmers in the drought region 
continued to improve their debt position in relation to assets 
the report said a major factor in their improvement was the 
continued upward trend in land values 
the report noted that higher market prices helped reduce the 
direct payments to farmers in 1988 under usdas commodity programs 
nationally those payments dropped to 98 billion from 115 
billion in 1987 
but congress also provided nearly 39 billion in emergency 
drought aid to farmers in 1988 the nine states in the study 
collected about 257 billion or twothirds of the total

hunters and others returning to the united 
states from mexico with animal trophies might run into some 
obstacles at the border 
the agriculture department says inspectors are on guard against 
items that can carry boophilus ticks into the united states 
this tick which carries bovine babesiosis a serious cattle 
disease often called texas cattle fever was eradicated from the 
united states in 1943 said james w glosser administrator of 
the departments animal and plant health inspection service 
strict measures are being taken to prevent the reintroduction of 
the tick he said 
for example animal carcasses with hides attached are not 
eligible for importation into the united states hides that have 
been tanned or soaked in a saltwater solution with mineral acid 
and dry antlers can be imported from mexico without restriction 
provided they are certified to be of mexican origin 
glosser said raw and untreated hides and antlers may qualify if 
they are certified by the mexican government to have been treated 
for ticks alternately they may be dipped at one of several 
mexican cattle export facilities along the border

the agriculture department is using tiny wheat 
fields of one square foot each to monitor the spread of leaf and 
stem rust in the southeast results have been mixed 
john roberts a scientist in the departments agricultural 
research service said the tiny plots are planted in july about 20 
miles apart along an interstate highway route through georgia 
florida alabama louisiana and mississippi then looping back into 
georgia 
the pilot study was begun in 1986 that was a drought year in 
the region and so was 1987 then in 1988 some of the wheat plots 
on low ground near the gulf coast drowned out 
highway maintenance crews sometimes mow down the wheat along 
with the weeds roberts said and deer and rabbits sometimes munch 
on the plants 
but roberts who works at the agencys research facility at 
griffin ga said the small test plots show real promise as a 
survey method

the soviet union has condemned the invasion of 
kuwait but soviet weapons and military experts helped make it 
possible and many of the experts are still in iraq 
on sunday president bush raised the issue of the experts with 
president mikhail s gorbachev at their summit in helsinki there 
had been speculation the soviet leader might agree to pull them out 
quickly 
he didnt but he did say at a news conference that their 
numbers had been reduced from 193 to about 150 and that they 
would continue to leave as their contracts expire 
they are leaving iraq and the process is moving forward so i 
dont think its a problem he said 
soviet officials have denied the experts played any direct role 
in planning or executing the aug 2 invasion but foreign ministry 
spokesman gennady gerasimov has acknowledged a moral problem in 
the military cooperation with iraq 
our military experts were in iraq to show how to deal with 
soviet military equipment which was sold to iraq for defensive 
purposes gerasimov said thursday 
this military technology was used not for defensive purposes 
which gave way to this moral problem that is to say we helped 
the aggressor 
throughout the past decade including the 198088 iraniraq war 
moscow was iraqs main weapons supplier it sold baghdad more than 
13 billion worth of t72 tanks scud and sam missiles mig29 
mig25 and sukhoi fighters helicopters artillery kalashnikov 
rifles small arms and ammunition according to the stockholm 
international peace research institute in sweden 
technical experts certainly numbering in the hundreds and 
possibly in the thousands were sent to teach iraqs army how to 
use and maintain the sophisticated weapons 
today the bulk of iraqs arms are still soviet said hans 
binnendijk a weapons analyst at the international institute for 
strategic studies in london 
of iraqs 5500 tanks all but about 30 are soviet of its 500 
planes nearly 80 percent are soviet although the iraqi air force 
also has about 100 french mirages of its surfacetoair missiles 
about 300 are soviet the remainder are 60 frenchmade rolands 
binnendijk said 
after the invasion of kuwait the kremlin abruptly shut down the 
arms pipeline 
so why has moscow balked at yanking out the technical experts 
soviet officials say they are bound to honor their contracts 
with baghdad but western diplomats and analysts say the soviets 
have ample legal grounds to cancel the contracts since iraq 
violated the terms by using the weapons for offensive purposes 
money could be a factor but probably not a decisive one the 
soviet union already has shown it is willing to forgo hundreds of 
millions of dollars in trade with iraq to comply with a un 
embargo 
some western observers suggested the kremlin may view the 
experts as a way to retain influence with iraqi president saddam 
hussein 
pulling out the experts would be closing another door to 
influence over the situation there and it might also anger certain 
conservatives in the soviet military who feel gorbachev has already 
caved into the united states and made too many oneway 
concessions mark von hagen a specialist on the soviet military 
said sunday by telephone from columbia university in new york 
a senior western military analyst in moscow said he was 
somewhat skeptical of the soviet claim that there were just 193 
military experts left in iraq at the time of the invasion 
the analyst speaking on condition of anonymity said the figure 
could be in the thousands he added that the discrepancy between 
soviet and western figures could be partly a matter of definition 
with the soviets choosing to count some advisers as civilians even 
though they work on militaryrelated equipment or construction 
projects 
the newspaper sovietskaya rossiya reported aug 26 that about 
7000 soviet civilian experts and their dependents were in iraq 
most working on six large construction projects a 1680megawatt 
power plant two oil fields a 40000ton grain elevator a 
hydroelectric plant on the euphrates river and an irrigation 
collector 
soviet officials say moscow has stopped sending civilian experts 
and has evacuated nearly 1000 women and children on special 
aeroflot flights 
some soviet newspaper columnists have urged the government to go 
further and sever its longstanding ties with saddam 
in my view there are every grounds to say that the 1972 
sovietiraqi friendship treaty has been violated by iraq and its 
continued existence does not increase our international 
prestige wrote yuri kornilov a tass commentator 
he added other voices have been raised against continued 
sovietiraqi cooperation but it seems they are not heard in the 
tall building on smolensk square the foreign ministry 
headquarters

more than four months after nicaraguas 
leftist government surrendered power the state department is 
expressing concern over evidence of continuing military transfers 
from sandinista partisans to rebels in el salvador 
the latest sign was the recent discovery by honduran authorities 
of a shipment of weapons and documents aboard a volkswagen minibus 
alleged to be headed for el salvador 
the vehicle intercepted near the nicaraguan border had a 
hidden compartment containing explosive charges for mortar rounds 
pamphlets false identification documents training booklets and 
blueprints of garrisons of the salvadoran armed forces honduran 
officials said the driver was a french woman who lived in mexico 
the seizure on aug 27 followed the arrest a month earlier in 
nicaragua of two salvadoran guerrillas with a truckload of weapons 
in their final weeks in office the sandinistas granted 
nicaraguan citizenship to several hundred salvadorans many of whom 
have been members of the fmln rebel group for years and used 
nicaragua as a base of operations 
the sandinistas defeated in february elections turned power 
over to president violeta chamorro in april but as part of her 
policy of national reconciliation they have been allowed to 
maintain effective control of the army and police 
her most significant gesture to the sandinistas was to permit 
humberto ortega brother of former president daniel ortega to 
remain as head of the armed forces 
sandinista links with their rebel allies in el salvador was the 
overriding reason the reagan administration offered military 
backing to the contra insurgents in nicaragua during much of the 
1980s 
we are disturbed that nicaraguan territory continues to be 
used to provide military support to the fmln the state 
department said last week it added that the shipment discovered in 
honduras was a blatant violation of the 1987 central american 
agreement which among other provisions forbids crossborder 
weapons shipments to rebel groups 
the department said it expects the united nations agency that 
monitors compliance with that agreement to investigate the matter 
vigorously 
we also expect that the government of nicaragua will take 
whatever measures are necessary to stop this pattern of activity 
which the sandinistas have conducted for years it said 
the department is likely to cite the continuing links between 
the sandinistas and the salvadoran rebels to reinforce its 
contention that the salvadoran armed forces need continued us 
support 
congressional democrats have been lobbying hard for sharp cuts 
arguing that to do otherwise would only prolong the 10year war 
between the salvadoran government and the rebels several rounds of 
peace talks have been held in recent months and a new round is to 
begin shortly

congress reconvenes this week in a changed 
more complicated and for its members a politically friendlier 
world than the one it left at the start of the summer recess 
although iraq invaded kuwait a few days before the break began 
the extent of the us military operation and the longterm nature 
of the commitment wasnt apparent now that the troops have dug in 
and the issue has sunk in congress is in its wartime mode 
while the prospect of war threatens the lives of american 
soldiers its life insurance for politicians president bush got a 
jump in the polls by ordering the biggest military deployment since 
vietnam and incumbents in congress also gained 
dozens of lawmakers from both chambers broke into their august 
vacations to make sure they were seen visiting us troops in the 
saudi arabian desert vulnerable incumbents whose membership in the 
armed services committee or foreign affairs committee seemed 
irrelevant a few weeks ago used the opportunity to raise their 
statesmanship quotient in front of the voters 
thats just one reason congress loves a military crisis even if 
members later turn against the war if it becomes unpopular 
the current atmosphere is not just prevalent among congress 
traditional hawks 
democrats of all stripes are praising bush at every turn in 
part at least it is a shield to deflect criticism of themselves 
by republicans as somehow unpatriotic at a time when national unity 
is demanded 
and with the middle east getting overriding public attention 
its especially hard for republicans to spell out their differences 
with the democrats who control congress 
unfortunately tough issues like taxes clean air the budget 
farm subsidies campaign reform and the savings and loan scandal 
remain unresolved and this congress could be tagged a loser unless 
it deals with most of them 
the 101st congress which convened in january 1989 has left 
most of its work for its final scheduled month lawmakers almost 
surely will be kept in washington past the scheduled oct 5 
adjournment date and there is widespread talk of a postelection 
session 
the cost of the iraq standoff both in 1 billionamonth 
military spending and higher oil prices complicates not only the 
budget but issues like the pending clean air bill and maybe even 
the farm bill currently in final drafting farmers are heavy users 
of petroleum products 
it even has affected the debate over bushs supreme court 
nominee david souter who faces senate hearings later this week 
opponents of the appointment had hoped to make their case to the 
public during the august recess but they were drowned out 
still to be seen is whether the mideast news will submerge other 
issues through the election and become a viable excuse to the 
voters for what so far has been a lackluster legislative 
performance 
or will voters turn their attention elsewhere to concerns like 
the weakening economy or abortion or even the congressional pay 
raise

jay cooper is rapping his fingers on 
his surveillance console and glancing at a photograph of his wife 
and daughters when the message comes from the mission crew 
commander of the us awacs plane 
weve finally got a wakeup call from iraq says the 
commander and the crew springs into action tracking the blip that 
suddenly appears on radar consoles showing iraqi air space 
cooper is a surveillance specialist on one of several us awacs 
planes involved in operation desert shield the planes and their 
30member crews keep a close eye on iraqi air activity and serve as 
traffic cops for the busy military patrols of american and saudi 
jets 
shortly after the blip appears cooper says weve got him 
within minutes the crew determines the plane is a large transport 
they track it until it lands but this incident is routine 
soon the screens again show blank iraqi and kuwaiti air space 
ninety minutes later the voice calling the men into action is 
more urgent the radar now shows an iraqi fighter streaking toward 
the saudi border 
its a fast fighter coming our way cooper says 
dispatching a radar technician to wake kevin lewis another 
surveillance officer who is napping 
the jet accelerates to 1600 mph before suddenly disappearing 
from the screen 
we lost him says lewis i dont know what happened he 
must have turned and screwed out of there 
this would prove the most dramatic incident during a more than 
15hour mission saturday night and sunday morning 
the 180 million awacs plane a converted boeing 707 formally 
known as the e3 airborne warning and control system is perhaps 
the most important element of the us air force presence in saudi 
arabia 
its fuselagemounted radar disc can see for more than 250 
miles picking up targets flying low or high several of the iraqi 
aircraft tracked saturday night and early sunday were helicopters 
for now the awacs is playing defense directing roundtheclock 
patrols by american and saudi jets over saudi arabia and the 
persian gulf 
but should war break out the awacs will shift to offense using 
its unrivaled view of the skies to direct friendly forces in combat 
the awacs would be essential not only because of its tracking 
abilities but also because many fighter jets in northern saudi 
arabia would be out of communication range of the us ground 
headquarters 
we can use awacs as an offensive or defensive mission said 
col tom bliss commander of the us awacs fleet deployed in saudi 
arabia were jacks of all trades 
during the overnight mission each time air traffic was spotted 
over iraq and kuwait the data was fed by awacs weapons officers to 
friendly aircraft navy ships ground control posts and patriot 
groundtoair missile batteries 
it is often boring yet grueling duty with hours on end spent 
staring at the radar consoles often jammed with green markers 
showing friendly aircraft red markers showing hostile airbases and 
yellow markers that signify unknown aircraft 
of late there have been nights when hours pass without any 
iraqi air activity saturday was one of those with a handful of 
spottings of fighter planes cargo planes and helicopters 
sleep is at a premium during the slow hours some men slept face 
down on their consoles others got one of the coveted cots or just 
found a spot on the flat hard floor 
the awacs generally flies only with fighters in the area to 
protect it but still is extremely vulnerable to attack pilots say 
they have little choice but to put their faith in their 
surveillance and weapons crews and the nearby fighters 
one of the more challenging and harrowing experiences for 
awacs pilots is inflight refueling 
the giant 707 has to be brought underneath and within 15 feet of 
a kc135 tanker which drops a boom that initially appears as if it 
will smash through the cockpit windshield but then catches a fuel 
receptacle 
during one refueling sunday the connection was lost twice 
forcing the pilot to repeatedly chase down the tanker and reconnect 
after receiving thousands of pounds of jet fuel the awacs heads 
back into its planned surveillance pattern for the rest of its 
mission 
the commanders face a formidable task in trying to keep the men

barbara bush and raisa gorbachev 
reached over the crowd of finnish women clasping outstretched 
fingers and straining to understand shouts of good will 
good good barbara one woman called in finnish from the 
back of the crowd that gathered before the two first ladies sunday 
where are you said mrs bush peering over a jumble of 
faces 
looking nice raisa said another woman interrupting mrs 
gorbachevs attempts to make a formal statement through her 
interpreter she reached up and held the hand of the speaker 
it was the only joint public appearance the two women made 
during the brief summit of their husbands president bush and 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
at the suggestion of mrs gorbachev an academic researcher 
they paged through antique books at the helsinki university 
library it holds one of the best collections of slavic literature 
in the west 
they were surrounded by picturesnapping wellwishers outside 
the library and pressed by reporters inside for predictions on the 
chances for peace 
yes there is a peaceful solution to the persian gulf 
crisis mrs bush said otherwise we wouldnt be here 
i hope our husbands along with the rest of the free world 
will work hard to make peace mrs bush said 
mrs gorbachev said as people as citizens of our 
countries the first ladies wanted a political peaceful 
solution to be found 
asked whether she was worried about american soldiers sent to 
saudi arabia mrs bush said of course we worry about the men 
and the women we worry 
mrs bush wore a royal blue dress and pearls then changed to a 
blue jacket over red dress for the flight home 
mrs gorbachev wore a severe gray suit and a violet blouse 
during the day appearing less stylish than she has on previous 
visits to the west mrs gorbachev has drawn criticism in the 
soviet union for her fashionable attire and has made fewer public 
appearances lately 
the first ladies along with tellervo koivisto wife of the 
finnish president examined ancient books manuscripts and maps 
including the oldest known moscow city map and an early american 
map showing california as an island 
librarian esko hakli escorted the women through the domed 
neoclassical library pointing out the rarest of its 3 million 
books and 2 million other documents 
mrs gorbachev a former university professor repeatedly 
prodded him for historical tidbits as they strolled past stacks of 
books 
she urged mrs bush to prepare for a visit to moscow by studying 
the 1538 map but hakli told reporters that it shows only the 
moscow river and a few other details and you wouldnt find your 
way with the help of that map

when the dust settled in this nordic 
capital mikhail gorbachev and george bush remained pretty much 
where they were before on the persian gulf crisis pledged to 
political and commercial means to secure iraqs withdrawal from 
kuwait 
bush repeated his pledge to withdraw us troops from saudi 
arabia when the gulf crisis ends and to provide economic assistance 
to bolster soviet reforms 
gorbachev repeated that he did not plan to send warships or 
troops to assist the usled effort to enforce united nations 
sanctions against iraq 
acknowledging nuances and differences on some issues 
the two men were grinning as they left for home bush nodded 
vigorously as gorbachev said we have confirmed the most important 
progress of recent times a sharp reduction of tension between 
the worlds two most powerful states 
but bush feigned horror when gorbachev told a joint news 
conference he wanted to tell you a secret here 
i havent asked president bush if hell let me but im dying 
to take the risk and tell you gorbachev said he changed the 
subject as bush shook his head 
pending disclosure of their summit secret the two leaders could 
look forward to further cooperation in the gulf crisis and as many 
as three possible further meetings this year one to sign a 
conventional arms control agreement at a european summit in 
november another when and if they conclude work a treaty to slash 
strategic arsenals by up to half 
they might also attend a ceremony in berlin on oct 3 reuniting 
the two germanys although neither has said he would go 
secretary of state james a baker iii later said theres 
optimism that we will conclude a conventional forces treaty for 
the conference on security and cooperation in europe to be attended 
by leaders of 35 nations in paris in november 
baker said they would sign a strategic arms treaty at the next 
summit meeting between these two presidents to be held in moscow at 
some time as yet undetermined 
gorbachev spent much of the news conference rebuffing 
suggestions that he was following the us lead in the gulf crisis 
to secure economic aid 
it would be very oversimplified and very superficial to judge 
that the soviet union could be bought for dollars he said 
gorbachev was asked to respond to iraq leader saddam husseins 
challenge for moscow to defy us will in the middle east to prove 
that it was still a superpower 
we do not want to get caught up in a debate about prestige 
the soviet leader responded 
no single country however powerful will be able to provide 
the leadership which individual countries formerly tried to 
provide including some countries which are represented here 
gorbachev said 
bush did not spell out concrete steps he might take to prop up 
the failing economy of the soviet union where shortages of bread 
and other staples were spreading but he said he wanted to bolster 
radical reforms in the soviet union 
we of course want perestroika to succeed bush said i 
think that this remarkable cooperation that has been demonstrated 
by the soviet union at the united nations gets me inclined to 
recommend as close cooperation in the economic field as possible 
and i will be saying this to the congress when i get back 
bush and senate leaders say they will push for ratification of a 
bilateral trade agreement and favorable tariffs for the soviet 
union once that nations parliament codifies recent liberalizations 
in emigration policy 
the president also noted that he was sending commerce secretary 
robert mosbacher to moscow this week with a team of us business 
executives to encourage economic cooperation in as many ways as 
possible 
white house chief of staff john sununu told reporters that the 
two leaders discussed cooperation in developing energy resources 
but he did not go as far as bush did saturday when the president 
said he might be willing to trade us technology for soviet oil 
the soviet union is the worlds largest oil producer

the economic and military 
embargoes in place against iraq could topple saddam hussein 
perhaps in two months say congressmen returning from recess trips 
to the middle east 
the officials we spoke with all felt that he had been weakened 
by the long costly iraniraq war the subsequent settlement with 
iran and his miscalculation in invading kuwait said rep 
john murtha dpa chairman of the house appropriations defense 
subcommittee 
murtha and nine other lawmakers returned sunday from visits with 
saudi arabian king fahd egyptian president hosni mubarak some 
exiled kuwaiti officials and us military commanders and troops 
in the field during their fiveday trip 
the consensus among the rulers they met with was that saddam 
the iraqi ruler would remain in power for two more months murtha 
said 
in that part of the world the insinuations were there are 
other methods of removing dictators from their positions of power 
other than caving in said murtha who would not elaborate 
murtha whose subcommittee oversees military spending said he 
could not estimate how much the us deployment in the gulf will 
cost 
he also said that military equipment was working surprisingly 
well in the hot sandy saudi desert 
you cant see 25 or 30 yards in front of you murtha said of 
the dusty conditions at the front lines equipment has to be 
maintained constantly they sleep in the sand beside their 
equipment yet even with those difficulties morale is very high 
the congressman that he and his colleagues wore military 
uniforms one day to test their comfort and found them acceptable 
he did say however that a lot of sand penetrated the boots and 
that officials have discussed sending different ones to the troops

food water and a trip home are the 
main concerns of asian evacuees from iraq and kuwait but they say 
theyve also been victimized by profiteers jordanian soldiers and 
callous officials 
one complaining indian in the scorching ruweishid refugee camp 
thrust a long handwritten letter into a reporters hands with the 
plea please publish this let the world know how they treat 
us 
pp abdulrahman of peringadi india said indian diplomats and 
other officials are showing cruel discrimination favoritism and 
are receiving bribes in picking people for repatriation 
his letter said officials have ignored deserving cases of 
pregnant women and aged people in an inhuman and cruel way in 
their selection of people for repatriation 
he added that jordanian soldiers in the camps are behaving 
inhumanly and several indians have been severely beaten 
other evacuees also complained about soldiers molesting women 
and providing them with extra food and water in return for sexual 
favors 
the reports could not be confirmed 
one prevalent complaint was that profiteers are selling bottled 
drinking water in the camp for 3 instead of the usual price of 30 
cents a packet of 20 local cigarettes was fetching 750 compared 
to the usual price of 75 cents 
evacuees said jordanian money changers come into the camp at 
night evading the guards who bar them by day they buy kuwaiti 
dinars in exchange for iraqi dinars at a rate of 21 or 11 
compared to 81 before the invasion 
the iraqi dinar although frozen on world currency markets is 
the quasiofficial currency of the camp 
the vast majority of evacuees are penniless laborers who say 
they fled kuwait with little more than the loincloths or saris they 
are wearing 
theres no embassy representative here he came one day then 
left and never came back said one indian man who would not give 
his name but said he had lived in kuwait for 30 years and had been 
a senior government official there 
other indians said an indian diplomat was stoned and forced to 
leave the camp last week because people complained he was showing 
favoritism in picking people for repatriation 
india said it had for a time stopped sending diplomatic 
officials to the camp because of security concerns 
more than 110000 mostly impoverished men women and children 
from bangladesh india pakistan philippines sri lanka thailand 
and other third world nations have been stuck in jordan since 
fleeing kuwait and iraq

the sounds of people on the move echoed through 
the cavernous halls of ellis island again as the gateway through 
which 12 million immigrants passed into the land of opportunity 
reopened as a museum 
six years and 156 million after work began on the biggest 
restoration project in us history the 90yearold brick building 
was dedicated sunday as the ellis island immigration museum and 
turned over to the national park service 
what we celebrate in ellis island is nothing less than the 
triumph of the american spirit said vice president dan quayle 
who snipped a white ribbon to open the museum at what was once 
americas busiest port of entry 
we may all know in our minds that time and time again it has 
been the immigrant who has renewed and rekindled the american 
spirit but here in ellis island we feel it in our hearts 
an audience of about 2500 invited guests gathered outside the 
huge fourtowered immigration building which was renovated 
entirely with private contributions to a foundation that also 
repaired the statue of liberty nearby 
after the ceremony people poured inside the building once 
again filling the vast registry room with sound 
fortynine new citizens were sworn in by supreme court justice 
antonin scalia and six people who entered the nation through ellis 
island in the first quarter of the century were singled out to 
represent the 12 million immigrants who passed through from 1892 
until 1954 
they included johanna flaherty 84 who said she left ireland in 
1923 because she didnt want to wake up and stare a cow in the 
face every morning 
another was clara larsen who came from russia in 1913 because 
she wanted an education in russia the jewish kids didnt stand 
a chance she recalled they didnt accept them in the public 
schools she went on to become an early leader of the 
international ladies garment workers union 
contributions by americans of immigrant stock were celebrated 
throughout the program down to the music the army band played 
selections by george gershwin scott joplin and irving berlin who 
came through ellis island as a child 
chrysler chairman lee iacocca who spearheaded the fundraising 
effort unveiled the american immigrant wall of honor it bears the 
names of about 200000 immigrants whose descendants donated 100 or 
more to the renovation 
there are thousands of different names thousands of different 
stories but you stitch all of them together and you have one huge 
saga and its our saga he said 
one of the names belonged to antonio macchiarola 80 of 
johnston ri who arrived at age 11 i was just a little bit of 
a kid and i had to go through these lines to be examined he 
said everybody was afraid they wouldnt make it 
macchiarola did like 98 percent of those who landed at ellis 
island but for those who were turned back including a little 
girl who traveled with his family and was rejected because of eye 
disease ellis island was called the isle of tears 
among the exhibits is one consisting of objects brought to the 
new world by immigrants items ranged from the exotic such as a 
formal aragonese dress fan from endofthecentury spain to 
passports and other travel documents china christening bonnets 
linens and a teddy bear 
oral histories help fill in the picture the mother of michael 
dukakis for instance recalls coming here not because of hunger or 
war but because women in her native greece could not go to college 
ellis island was the gateway to the new world for the ancestors 
of two out of five americans between 1892 and 1924 an average of 
5000 people a day passed through on the busiest day april 17 
1907 11747 immigrants were processed 
the us government opened the first immigration station on the 
island in 1892 but the building burned down five years later 
its replacement was finished in 1900 a building designed to 
impress immigrants with its ornate copper domes vast windows and 
vaulted ceilings

when pvt michael durnell began 
basic army training the persian gulf was a faraway chapter from 
geography lessons and iraq hadnt invaded kuwait 
eight weeks later durnell and his buddies say they can handle 
fighting in the gulf or whatever the army hands them 
nobody looks forward to going into a possible war situation 
but im definitely ready to do the job said durnell 21 of 
kansas city mo 
he was among 560 new soldiers all in their teens or early 20s 
who graduated last thursday from basic training at fort leonard 
wood the 64000acre post in the ozarks has prepared soldiers for 
a halfcentury 
at seven other army posts across the nation army recruits have 
the same regimen up at 430 am in bed by 8 pm six days a 
week 
don moore of atlanta watched with other parents during the 
graduation ceremony as the teenagers turned young men marched with 
heads held high and chests puffed out 
id hate to lose him but you take an oath to protect your 
country we have to protect ourselves freedom is not free moore 
said 
the prospect of war in the middle east was not emphasized during 
training all recruits face months of specialized training before 
getting their first assignment 
but lt col stephen rasmussen commander of the graduating 
battalion acknowledged the persian gulf crisis in his speech if 
i could ask an iraqi general what these men have done he would say 
theyve worried him a lot he said 
army officials here say they wont change training to suit the 
desert that training includes three weeks of weapons training 80 
miles of marching and millions of pushups 
capt mike presnell watched as 150 of his recruits crawled 
dodged and ran along a 400yard tactical training course in 
100degree heat 
my job is to prepare soldiers to serve in any type of combat 
to graduate combatready soldiers said presnell 
behind him recruits in full combat gear trained to stay alive 
with a sensor device on the helmet and chest the device is 
activated by an infrared beam fired by someone in hiding the beam 
sets off a beep to denote a kill 
they love this they like testing their skills you provide 
them exciting training and theyll be motivated presnell said 
its better they learn their lessons here when its only a beep 
gone are days of filling the ranks with highschool dropouts and 
those in trouble with the law back home now if you dont have a 
high school diploma forget it 
the soldier of today is a hell of a lot better than the 
soldier of 14 years ago were getting better men to begin with 
said maj harold von fischerbenzon a brigade training officer 
the failure rate in basic training is about 5 percent he said 
gone too are the screaming shouting drill sergeants training 
by fear and intimidation 
profanity is out harassment is out its a modern army they 
volunteered to come in you dont need vulgar language anymore

the iron curtain has come down but not 
the wall around alexander solzhenitsyn 
the changes in the soviet union have brought publication of 
solzhenitsyns longbanned books and an offer to restore 
citizenship to the exiled writer 
but the nobel laureate and chief chronicler of 20th century 
russian history remains in his vermont compound deep in the woods 
off a dirt road his home surrounded by a fence with a tv monitor 
at the gate 
what has emanated from behind the fence in recent months has 
been mostly silence only two brief statements have broken the 
quiet with solzhenitsyns characteristic anger and sarcasm 
a soviet official was quoted by the tass news agency aug 16 as 
saying the 71yearold solzhenitsyn had held highlevel talks with 
soviet officials about restoring his citizenship 
the response from the writers wife natalia who frequently 
speaks for him this is a lie 
until soviet authorities formally lift their charge of high 
treason against her husband and admit they were wrong to expel him 
in 1974 there can be no discussion about the reinstatement of 
citizenship mrs solzhenitsyn said 
in late august solzhenitsyn indicated he was preparing to speak 
out at length he wrote to the soviet newspaper komsomolskaya 
pravda that he had completed an article containing his views on 
current soviet affairs and the potential as well as necessary 
measures that need to be taken 
but in what appeared to be an indication of his doubts about 
soviet changes solzhenitsyn sarcastically referred to past 
official excuses about paper shortages preventing widespread 
publication of his works 
one only has to wonder whether there will be enough paper in 
the ussr to facilitate an inexpensive and mass publication of 
this brochure 
michael scammell solzhenitsyns biographer and former 
translator said that until the article appears those wondering 
about solzhenitsyns desires for his homeland have to rely on his 
letter to the leaders written in 1973 
in that letter solzhenitsyn said the russian orthodox church 
should be allowed to function freely the communist party should 
give up its monopoly on power censorship should be abolished the 
republics should be given the option of independence and a strong 
authoritarian leader should head the government but also allow 
strong debate within society 
scammell said the soviet union in recent years had moved well 
past 50 percent toward meeting those goals the russian orthodox 
patriarch was shown on soviet television last christmas christmas 
and easter may become official holidays again 
rifts within the communist party have created power sharing 
scammell added solzhenitsyns the gulag archipelago his 
devastating critique of communist repression has been published 
and the red wheel a series of historical works about the 
russian revolution is being serialized in literary magazines 
scammell said its difficult to know whether the changes are 
good enough for solzhenitsyn 
hes a romantic through and through scammell said 
solzhenitsyn heard family stories in his youth about life before 
the revolution and czarist russia came to be somewhat idealized 
in his mind scammell said 
unless he has had a major change of heart solzhenitsyns dream 
for russia is not modeled on westernstyle democracy the author 
lashed out at the west as too legalistic and materialistic in a 
commencement address at harvard in 1978 
scammell said solzhenitsyn probably would like his russian 
orthodox faith to become almost an established part of the 
state 
solzhenitsyns terms for change in his homeland might contain 
room for compromise but his terms for his own return do not 
he wrote to komsomolskaya pravda that it would be 
inconceivable for me to be a guest or a tourist in my own homeland 
to return and then leave when i do return home it will be to 
live and die there

mondays close was the lowest since oct 2 1989 when the currency 
closed at 13930 yen 
stock traders said the nikkei rose sharply beginning in the 
early morning as investors made indexlinked largescale purchases 
in a positive reaction to the weekend summit meeting between 
president bush and his soviet counterpart mikhail s gorbachev 
the two leaders joined sunday in an extraordinary condemnation 
of iraqs invasion of kuwait and said they agreed that 
aggression cannot and will not pay 
share prices jumped as soon as the market opened today and

the stock market which has been reacting tensely to 
developments in the persian gulf since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 
2 slid for four straight days last week and hit its lowest trading 
level of the year before fridays recovery 
on the currency exchange dealers said the dollars slide was 
due to widespread pessimism about the us economy 
because the gulf situation is prolonged and is still going 
nowhere investors concern is now focused more on a slowdown in 
the us economy said masato hayashi a customer dealer with the 
bank of tokyo 
he said investors are actively selling the dollar aiming at the 
13850yen level on expectations of possible relaxation of us 
monetary policy 
but the question is how far the yen which has no specific 
factor to keep attracting investors can remain stronger against 
the dollar as well as the major european currencies hayashi

british women arriving home from kuwait and iraq 
wept as they told of having to leave fathers and husbands behind to 
an uncertain fate 
briton suzanne turvey 18 said she was persistently questioned 
by iraqi forces in kuwait until she told them where her father oil 
company worker john turvey was hiding 
she said her father was taken to baghdad and she does not know 
where he is now miss turvey had been on vacation staying with her 
father who worked in kuwait for eight years 
i was interrogated by the iraqi soldiers and eventually i had 
to tell them where he was otherwise she added they said i 
wasnt going to be going anywhere 
my poor husband is still there said bhavna trivedi 32 
the last time i saw him was 10 days ago he is in kuwait hiding 
she held her baby son adarsh after arriving at gatwick airport 
late sunday on a british governmentchartered iraqi airways flight 
from baghdad with more than 400 other women and children 
he cannot go out to buy food mrs trivedi said of her 
husband friends are looking after him there is a warning that 
if you are found harboring british citizens you will be hanged for 
treason i am scared 
everyone is tense she added there is a lot of 
resistance they are trying to blow up ammunition trucks there is 
a lot of shooting on the street a lot of people are informing 
british airways the handling agent for sundays charter said 
163 americans among the 438 passengers would leave for baltimore 
this afternoon the americans spent the night in a hotel at gatwick 
in charleston sc 305 weary us evacuees mostly women and 
children sang god bless america when their chartered jet from 
jordan touched down late sunday they were greeted with applause by 
those waiting at the airport after the boeing 747 landed 
an estimated 21000 westerners were in iraq and kuwait when iraq 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 and us officials estimate about 2200 
americans remain some of the men in that group have been sent to 
military installations to serve as human shields against possible 
attack 
theresa fannon a 46yearold nurse from northern ireland and 
other staff members of a kuwait hospital decided to join a bus 
convoy to baghdad it was 4 am when we were stopped at a 
checkpoint and taken to the police station which had been turned 
into an iraqi military base 
there were young soldiers waving guns about and they kept us 
outside in the boiling heat for eight hours 
the small party of britons were then taken to a sorting center 
and left out in the sun for another four hours 
we nearly died that day left 12 hours in the heat miss 
fannon said 
once in baghdad the iraqis split up families and couples at a 
city hotel it was tragic watching the husbands standing there on 
the steps with the children crying and the wives getting ready to 
leave she said 
most of the men have lost a lot of weight and look pale as 
they have been under house arrest for five weeks 
we assumed they were being moved to military installations and 
neither the british nor the irish embassies seem to have much idea 
where they were going

american fighter pilots have been 
ordered except in the most threatening situations to wait for a 
goahead from saudi commanders before firing at any iraqi jets 
us air force officers say 
the restrained rules of engagement apply even in some cases in 
which iraqi jets are deemed hostile 
the rules are designed to sigificantly cut the risk of an 
american pilot firing the first shot in a war with iraq and 
upsetting the volatile regional politics that now have most arab 
nations behind the united states and saudi arabia the officials 
said sunday 
the one thing we dont want to do is start a war by someone 
making a mistake said air force col tom bliss commander of 
us airborne warning and control system or awacs operations in 
the middle east 
its not one of those shoot first and ask questions later 
situations he said 
bliss said that if an awacs plane were to detect a potentially 
hostile iraqi aircraft it would relay the information to the 
command post in saudi arabias eastern province there the saudis 
are in control but an american is always on duty 
it would be up to the saudis to formally designate the aircraft 
hostile and in most cases to decide whether to open fire bliss 
said 
under almost all situations we want the saudis to make the 
call he said 
however the saudis do not have permission to order us forces 
to attack iraqi forces 
under the rules the saudis can tell american fighters to make a 
risky visual identification of iraqi jets even if the 
sophisticated detection systems aboard us aircraft already have 
positively identified the jet bliss said 
exceptions to these rules could occur if communication between 
the air and the saudis on the ground were lost or if an individual 
pilot determined his aircraft to be in imminent danger bliss said 
if communications were lost crew chiefs aboard the awacs would 
work with their weapons officers and could make the decision to 
fire on iraqi jets provided certain criteria were met air force 
officers said 
a pilot acting alone could decide to fire at a hostile jet but 
he too would first have to follow a clear set of guidleines the 
officers said 
for tactical and security reasons the officers discussed the 
rules of engagement on condition those guidelines were not 
disclosed 
we dont want the other guy to know how we would react to a 
certain situation bliss said but he added were taking every 
precaution so somebody doesnt pull the trigger 
the rules for the us pilots are not unlike those for american 
ground troops 
although the american forces are spreading out in increasing 
numbers in northern saudi arabia within striking distance of 
iraqi forces in iraq and occupied kuwait they are deliberately 
being kept behind arab forces led by the saudi army 
ground commanders over the last two weeks have said the 
deployment is designed to make it highly unlikely an american would 
fire the first shot in a ground war or be the first casualty if 
iraqs saddam hussein ordered an attack 
bliss said another reason for the caution in the air is the 
possibility of iraqi defectors 
he said us and saudi pilots assumed any iraqi pilot trying to 
defect would attempt to communicate his intentions and avoid any 
maneuvers that could be interpreted as hostile 
monitoring of iraqi air activity during a 15hour awacs mission 
that began saturday evening and ended sunday morning confirmed 
recent reports that the iraqis generally fly few sorties at night 
american and saudi jets flying air patrols around the clock are 
generally staying clear of airspace claimed by baghdad including 
that over occupied kuwait 
i havent seen provocative acts on either side said a 
senior american air force official in saudi arabia who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
but i wouldnt say theyre going out of their way to avoid a 
provocation 
bliss and members of the awacs crew interviewed during the awacs 
mission said the iraqis were conducting frequent daytime missions 
some of which appeared to be combat air patrols and others routine 
training flights 
on occasion the iraqis fly close to the saudi border once 
within four miles crew members said

sorry sir there are no plans for an 
underwater shopping mall in the inner harbor no maam a highway 
is not coming through your living room and no pull tabs from soda 
cans and empty cigarette packs do not pay for kidney dialysis 
for 22 years operators at the citys rumor control center have 
been handing out facts and dispelling rumors for confused or 
curious citizens 
the rumor was it would be an underwater mall and they would 
have a restaurant and you could pick out your dinner from behind 
the glass said tom saunders whos worked for the hot line for 
10 years we had contractors calling up wanting to build it 
rumor control hot lines were opened in several major cities in 
the 1960s to ease tension in the wake of race riots although the 
violence of that era has passed baltimores hot line still has a 
place and some cities that dropped theirs are reviving the idea 
saunders said 
philadelphia recently opened a rumorcontrol hot line after a 
black man was shot to death by a korean shopkeeper he said 
besides handling the frivolous rumors baltimore officials say 
the hot line keeps the public informed about topics that could 
affect health or safety and helps the city to keep in touch with 
its residents 
its a place people can call to get good information but also 
cast a straw vote in effect for things the city should be doing 
to enhance the community said city council president mary pat 
clarke 
we dont try to appease people we give them the facts from a 
creditable source said lillian jones head of the community 
division of the citys community relations commission which 
operates the hot line 
calls from people expressing a desire to heal race relations 
helped lead to the scheduled meeting of community leaders in 
november the calls followed several apparently racially motivated 
incidents this summer 
each day one of the six workers in baltimores community 
relations office takes a turn staffing the hot line answering 
questions and collecting rumors 
most of the rumors are in reference to news events people 
receive misinformation or bits and pieces and they call rumor 
control saunders said 
workers try to keep abreast of current events he said a 
bulletin board on the wall of the small downtown office is littered 
with news articles fliers and information about events that have 
been brought to the staffs attention 
rumors called in by the public range from the farfetched to the 
mundane health safety and neighborhood issues make up the 
majority of calls 
one of the most unusual rumors called in recently involved the 
ku klux klans purported ownership of a popular line of sweatsuits 
the rumor was the guy who owned it was on a television show 
and he said blacks will overpay for anything saunders said he 
said he was a member of the klan and decided to put out an 
expensive sweatsuit 
we found out a jewish person owned the company therefore he 
wouldnt be a member of the ku klux klan 
the hot line still gets calls from people wondering where to 
send empty cigarette packs and pull tabs from soda cans to help pay 
for kidney dialysis 
people have trash bags of cigarette packs i run into people 
myself at the barber shop who ask for cigarette packages and pull 
tabs saunders said they swear to me they know what they are 
talking about

a inmate convicted in the shotgun 
slaying of an elderly man who walked in on a burglary was put to 
death by injection early monday in oklahomas first execution in 24 
years 
charles troy coleman 43 was pronounced dead at 1235 am at 
oklahoma state penitentiary 
just tell everybody i love them and i have a peace and quiet 
heart coleman his voice quivering said shortly before he died 
at one point he turned toward his attorney mandy welch and said 
i love you mandy 
as he died candlelight vigils were held outside the prison and 
at the capitol in oklahoma city 
oklahoma becomes the 15th state to execute someone since the 
us supreme court in 1976 allowed use of the death penalty to 
resume coleman was the 138th person put to death in the united 
states since the high court ruling 
coleman had been sentenced to die for the 1979 slaying of john 
seward in muskogee seward 68 and his wife roxie 62 were 
killed when they surprised a burglar at a relatives home coleman 
was not tried in mrs sewards death 
colemans truck was seen at the home and customcut meat and 
other possessions from the house were found in his truck when he 
was arrested 
he had more than 25 appeals in his 11year fight to escape 
execution coming within 36 hours of execution three years ago 
before receiving a stay the us supreme court had turned down his 
case seven times twice on sunday 
his final request for a stay failed in a 61 vote with justice 
thurgood marshall dissenting justice harry blackmun did not 
participate 
the defense had raised mental competency questions in seeking a 
stay 
the last person put to death in oklahoma was james d french 
electrocuted in 1966 for killing his cellmate oklahoma has 115 
people on death row 
gov henry bellmon who also was governor in 1966 had denied 
clemency to coleman 
there is obviously a sadistic streak of behavior in this 
case he said the question is should a man like this ever be 
placed back in society i think the answer is no 
colemans wife lynda said in a statement charles is in a 
better place he is with god and at peace now i dont have to 
worry about him suffering anymore 
it is really sad that people are so bloodthirsty but really i 
dont condemn them they think it is right but i dont believe its 
right with god the 10 commandments say thou shalt not kill 
coleman had been in and out of prison since he was a teenager 
on charges including burglary robbery assault and murder he was 
acquitted in 1976 in california in the beating and stabbing death 
of his girlfriends father 
police said coleman escaped from the jail while awaiting trial 
in the seward case later slashing a policemans throat and 
stealing his gun 
police believe the officers gun was used to kill a man in tulsa

secretary of state james a baker iii 
was expected today to announce he would go to damascus later this 
week to meet with syrian president hafez assad 
the visit would surely boost syrias standing even though it 
remains on a state department list of seven terrorismsponsoring 
countries 
shattering old lineups in the middle east the administration 
since the persian gulf crisis began has been courting both syria 
and iran to put pressure on iraq to force it to relinquish control 
of kuwait 
assad a bitter foe of iraqi president saddam hussein has sent 
troops to both saudi arabia and the united arab emirates as part of 
a usled persian gulf defense force 
iran meanwhile is said to be observing the economic boycott of 
iraq called for by the un security council on aug 2 
us officials said baker informed israeli foreign minister 
david levy of his schedule at a meeting last thursday in washington 
the state department in its annual human rights reports 
consistently has criticized syrias domestic practices while the 
office of counterterrorism has implicated palestinian groups 
operating out of the syriacontrolled bekaa valley of lebanon in 
attacks on americans and israelis 
one such incident was the bombing of a pan am passenger plane 
over lockerbie scotland in december 1988 the popular front for 
the liberation of palestine general command which is maintained 
by syria is suspected of the attack 
the group also faces charges in west germany of attempting to 
blow up troop trains carrying americans 
there is no evidence that syrian officials were involved in 
planning or executing terrorist attacks outside lebanon since 
1987 the department said in this years patterns of global 
terrorism 
however the report said they continue to provide support and 
safe haven to a number of groups that engaged in international 
terrorism 
also the report said despite syrian statements abhoring 
terrorism syria considers palestinian terrorist incidents directed 
against targets in israel and the west bank and gaza to be part 
of the legitimate palestinian struggle for independence 
baker flew to brussels after attending president bushs meeting 
in helsinki finland with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
bakers two main tasks in the sixhour stop were to report to 
the north atlantic treaty organization on the summit and to solicit 
contributions from the 12nation european community for the 
campaign against iraq

bert parks flubbed return to the 
miss america pageant was blamed on two pages of his script sticking 
together 
miss illinois marjorie judith vincent a 25yearold law student 
from oak park was crowned early sunday as miss america 1991 
parks fired as emcee 10 years ago for being too old got a 
standing ovation at the start of the pageant saturday night but 
skipped the names of at least a dozen former miss americas during 
the introduction of 29 past winners 
at one point the 75yearold crooner also rambled and was 
interrupted by master of ceremonies gary collins 
pageant director leonard horn said sunday he has not decided 
whether to invite parks back next year but that the blunder would 
not affect his decision 
its a shame for bert because he was so excited its one 
of the chances you take with live tv horn said 
the mistake came when two pages in parks script stuck together 
horn said i dont have a gut reaction to it the pageant 
director said apparently he went to card three and skipped card 
two in his excitement 
parks also rambled about raunchy comedians and a good place to 
eat on the boardwalk and he asked america to refer to women as 
ladies rather than chicks collins took parks by the arm 
and said it was time to let the contestants speak 
horn said parks did not adlib too long 
its very unfair of the press to think he was dragged off 
horn said i thought he was wonderful he brought an excitement 
to the show and to this town 
reached at home in greenwich conn parks wife annette said 
her husband was not available for comment sunday 
miss vincent a thirdyear law student at duke university who 
wants to practice international law credited her victory to 
determination and a lifelong ambition to participate in the pageant 
she spoke to reporters on the boardwalk shortly after 7 am 
sunday for the traditional frolicking in the surf picture 
if you want to achieve a goal and work for it very hard you 
can achieve it miss vincent said in french to the people of 
haiti from which her parents immigrated 
she chose the plight of battered women as the issue she will 
emphasize during her reign 
she said she was stunned that she won finally falling asleep at 
4 am and wants to celebrate with the cheesecake that was 
previously denied her 
i still dont believe im here said miss vincent wearing 
the pageants rhinestone tiara and a sapphire blue dress with an 
olive green purple and black scarf it still doesnt seem real

shares traded hands on the markets first section 
todays sixthlargest singleday increase followed a 
15016point rise friday 
traders said the nikkei index began rising sharply in response 
to the outcome of the summit sunday in helsinki finland where 
president bush and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev agreed on 
responses to iraqs invasion of kuwait 
kazuo horikoshi a dealer with new japan securities said 
largescale buying contributed strongly to mondays surge 
share prices jumped as soon as the market opened today and 
the surge in the spot market prompted rises in the futures also 
he said 
masahiro umemori an analyst with nomura securities co said 
the nikkeis rise in part was a technical adjustment before the 
final trading day for september futures scheduled for thursday 
he said some bargain hunting also helped push up the index

developments in the gulf since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 slid 
for four days last week and hit its lowest trading level of the 
year before fridays recovery 
dealers said crosstrading in which investors bought the yen by 
selling european currencies for profittaking weakened the dollar 
against the yen 
masato hayashi of the bank of tokyo attributed the dollars 
slide to widespread pessimism about the us economy 
because the gulf situation is prolonged and seems to be going 
nowhere investors concern is now focused more on a slowdown in 
the us economy he said 
hayashi said investors were actively selling the dollar aiming 
at the 13850yen level on expectations of a possible relaxation 
of us monetary policy 
meanwhile bank of japan governor yasushi mieno told a news 
conference today that japans recent discount rate increase and the 
rise in oil prices to 30 a barrel do not pose a threat to japans 
economy but he noted the economic environment remains in a 
serious state of flux 
mieno said the effects of iraq shock remain manageable at 
the 30 a barrel level compared to economic setbacks japan 
experienced in two previous oil shocks in the 1970s 
the nations central bank raised its official discount rate on 
aug 30 from 525 percent to 6 percent in an effort to cool 
inflationary pressure prompted by oil price increases resulting 
from the gulf crisis

japanese bonds closed at 8225 percent down from fridays 8245 
percent their price rose to 8257 points from fridays 8248

dead bodies stored in an ice rink 
mental patients roaming the streets and people dying due to a lack 
of hospital care 
that is the grim medical picture painted by a group of kuwaiti 
exiles gathering reports about life in their iraqioccupied country 
there are no medical services except for scattered kuwaiti 
doctors running clinics from their homes says dr fawzia 
alsayegh a pediatrician who used to split her time between london 
and kuwait 
if you have an emergency you die she said adding that 
iraqi troops control the hospitals and have denied access to 
kuwaitis 
information received by the exiles comes from people fleeing 
kuwait and from shortwave or satellite radio transmissions from 
the country 
the information could not be independently verified because all 
regular telephone and mail communication has been cut off by the 
estimated 170000 iraqi troops who have occupied the country in the 
wake of the aug 2 invasion 
up to 1 million people are estimated trapped in kuwait 
the exiles some of them members of kuwaits ruling alsabah 
clan relayed chilling tales of food shortages killings and 
hospital patients dying after being deprived of lifesustaining 
equipment 
some of the stories deal with medical care the pride of kuwait 
until a month ago free care used to be given to citizens at 
hospitals boasting some of the most advanced equipment in the world 
among the claims made by the kuwaitis gathered from numerous 
interviews as well as from statements by mohammed abulhasan 
kuwaits un ambassador 
twentytwo premature babies died shortly after the iraqi 
invasion when troops took away their oxygen supplies abulhasan 
mentioned this is a letter to the un security council the deaths 
were said to occur six days after the invasion 
bodies of dead kuwaitis are being stored in what used to be an 
iceskating rink according sheika merian alsabah daughter of 
kuwaits crown prince 
four cases of cholera an often fatal disease that breeds in 
unsanitary conditions have been reported dr alsayegh said 
cholera is transmitted through contaminated food and water 
iraqi troops have pillaged five regular hospitals stealing 
equipment and transferring plasma deposits from blood banks to 
baghdad the hospitals were emptied of regular patients some of 
whom died exiles said 
they want to prepare the hospitals for iraqi war injuries 
dr alsayegh said 
two kuwaiti and one egyptian woman were left to care for 130 
handicapped and mentally disturbed children after the invasion 
many of the former caregivers mostly expatriate asians fled the 
country after the invasion dr alsayegh said 
mental patients were let out of the psychiatric hospital to 
roam the streets without medication or care they dont know what 
is happening they are sick the pediatrician said it was her 
understanding that most of the patients have been taken in to 
private homes 
ambulances no longer function because iraqi troops shot out the 
tires of many vehicles dr alsayegh said

new kids on the block are fast shedding their 
squeakyclean image as an allamerican pop group as they make 
headlines over an increasing number of scuffles 
new kids lawyer len lewin planned a trip to the west coast 
today to talk to members of the group about their offstage behavior 
some program is going to be established to change things 
around as to how they conduct themselves i think something has to 
be done lewin said were going to sit down with parents 
kids management the whole team 
the boston globe published an editorial suggesting that new kids 
on the block while craftily marketed as cleancut churchgoing 
innercity youths are actually successspoiled youths who 
badly need disciplining 
in the past month the quintet of teenagers from a 
workingclass background in bostons dorchester section and their 
retinue were involved in at least six violent incidents no charges 
have been filed against the group 
in the most recent incident new kid donnie wahlberg 20 
allegedly scuffled with a 20yearold harvard student over an 
airline seat sept 2 on a flight from salt lake city to atlanta 
wahlberg allegedly punched benjamin dattner as some of the groups 
entourage held him down 
the two exchanged blows after wahlberg poked dattner in the eye 
witnesses said dattner was taken to a hospital for a scratched 
cornea and bruises and was released 
the groups tarnished image has left some of its legions of 
young fans or blockheads a little disillusioned 
im not sure im liking them anymore because they dont act 
like they used to kristin bothwell 10 of the citys roxbury 
section said last week people are getting into fights and they 
might start a big bad fight 
wahlberg has been the group member most involved in the 
incidents last month he and his bodyguard allegedly tussled with 
georgia tech students in atlanta the same night group member 
jordan knight was accused of hitting a 21yearold woman in a bar 
and his bodyguard was accused of beating up two men 
in massachusetts two of wahlbergs brothers were arrested in 
front of his home in suburban braintree during a fight a man from 
foxboro said last month he was beaten up by relatives of group 
members at a quincy nightclub 
lewin said he was still trying to gather facts about the latest 
incident he said some of the kids trouble may just come with 
the territory 
is there anything you can do about it im not so sure he 
said 
the group has been enormously popular mainly with teenagers 
and preteens its tours have been marked by sellouts and pressing 
throngs two april concerts in england led to the hospitalization 
of several frenetic fans and firstaid had to be administered to 
hundreds of youngsters 
at this years american music awards new kids won the favorite 
poprock album trophy for their hangin tough lp and were named

chancellor helmut kohl says he wants a 
constitutional change that would let troops from a united germany 
take part in un peacekeeping missions 
such a change would come in december at the earliest kohl said 
sunday 
since the persian gulf crisis began west german officials have 
said a clause in their constitution bars them from sending troops 
to back up us soldiers and those from other nations 
that stance has led to criticism in washington 
kohl cited the iraqi invasion of kuwait on aug 2 as a clear 
example of why a constitutional change is needed to permit german 
soldiers in un missions 
as a member of the united nations we cannot stand to the side 
when the un asks us to take responsiblity kohl said in an 
interview on deutschlandfunk radio repeating the stance his 
government took last month 
kohl said he will seek such a change after the first joint 
german elections dec 2 
although kohls conservative christian democrats are favored to 
win the elections a victory by the leftist social democrats would 
make such a constitutional change much less likely 
the chancellor referred to criticism that his country is not 
doing enough to counter iraqs current aggression 
kohl said many people in other countries say of the germans 
when its a question of making money theyre right there but 
when it comes to taking responsibility they slip away 
thats an opinion that you can already meet in many places 
internationally the chancellor said 
west germany has also been asked to provide money for the us 
soldiers in the gulf secretary of state james a baker iii is 
scheduled to discuss the issue during a visit saturday to bonn

an iraqi attack on saudi arabia would 
collapse within two weeks but iraqi troops dug in at their 
southern border and kuwait could resist a us offensive for months 
and inflict heavy casualties analysts say 
war is always a political decision but theres a less than 5 
percent chance of war if that decision is made by logical military 
thinking said one highranking western military officer in 
baghdad neither side has a viable military option now 
western military analysts argued that as iraq slowly crumbles 
under un economic sanctions imposed after it invaded kuwait on 
aug 2 there is less and less reason for any attack to force 
concessions from president saddam hussein 
iraq they say cannot afford to resort to a military strike 
the analysts contended iraqi aircraft are no match for the us 
warplanes and believe the americans would quickly gain air 
superiority but some said iraq with its army of about 1 million 
men has some of the best ground forces in the world and that a 
conventional war cannot be won by air power alone 
in addition iraqs chances for battlefield success are hurt by 
its leadership and its inability to take full advantage of the 
sophisticated weapons it possesses the analysts said 
saddam who has no military training gives the orders and the 
analysts said they were not impressed by his tactical decisions 
during the iraniraq war of 198088 
however they said the lightning invasion of kuwait indicated 
that saddam might be learning and heeding military advisers trained 
abroad 
it was well planned and well executed but there was no real 
opponent we dont know how effectively they can overcome massive 
resistance one analyst said like the others he spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
because of the international economic embargo ordered by the 
united nations iraq is now hobbled by supply line problems 
shortages of spare parts and a lack of foreign technicians to 
maintain its sophisticated air force and highly mechanized army 
under these conditions an iraqi attack into saudi arabia would 
crumble within weeks the analysts said 
during an overall attack its operational status would fall 
to 4050 percent in two weeks one said 
but dug in behind the border with a months supply of spare 
parts iraq could hold out for two months withstanding massive air 
attacks and inflicting tens of thousands of casualties the 
analysts said 
one said it would be possible to defeat iraq but any attack 
would be costly and dangerous 
if theres a war itll be a real war not limited war so we 
can expect lots of casualties he said you can be sure the 
iraqis would fight 
even when the vast buildup of us and multinational forces is 
complete the hasty alliance would be unable to strike iraq with 
any guarantee of success the analysts said 
iraq has the third or fourthlargest armed forces in the 
world said one iraqi equipment is comparable to almost any 
western army 
in addition to the 1 million men iraq has 2 million reservists 
it has 25 divisions 400000 battleseasoned troops in kuwait 
and southern iraq 
the infantry is supported by two armored divisions 1500 tanks 
and 1000 other armored vehicles 700 artillery pieces and about 
1200 surfacetosurface missiles of various kinds the analysts 
said 
in kuwait alone iraq has massed 16 divisions comprising 170000 
to 180000 men they said 
conventional military wisdom holds that an attacking force needs 
a 31 superiority one analyst noted that means that us forces 
attacking on a front 25 to 32 miles wide would need 350000 men 
at the moment the united states has only about 100000 troops 
in saudi arabia 
on the ground iraqs superior to almost any force the united 
states can bring in said the highranking western officer 
iraqs air force is modern at least as modern as west 
germanys 
iraq has more than 1000 combat aircraft on 20 to 25 bases 
heavily protected by sovietmade surfacetoair missiles and 
antiaircraft guns one western analyst said 
iraqs deployment of its aircraft around so many welldefended 
bases means the americans will not be able to knock out the iraqi 
air force with a quick decisive first strike one analyst said 
moreoever iraq is thought to have about 300 missiles capable of 
hurling warheads 167 miles about 400 with a range of 372 miles and 
about 45 launchers for both types of missiles 
the analysts believe iraq has few if any chemical warheads for 
their missiles but said the threat of chemical warfare is very 
real in battlefield areas within range of artillery gas shells 
the analysts also said there are some morale problems among 
iraqi troops because the army cannot supply them with enough water 
and good food 
there are also signs of problems in the officer corps some 
officers were executed for opposing the invasion of kuwait as many 
as 120 by some unconfirmed reports

cardiologist bernadine p healy research 
director of a cleveland clinic and a former federal health 
official is in line to head the national institutes of health as 
the first woman in that job sources say 
the 46yearold physician a former president of the american 
heart association as well as the american federation for clinical 
research would become the 13th director of the world renowned 
research facility 
gary weiland a spokesman at the cleveland clinic foundation 
said sunday that healy was traveling out of town and he did not 
know how to contact her regarding accounts of her pending 
appointment 
weiland said he was unaware of any notification to the clinic 
that healy had been chosen for the nih post which has remained 
vacant during most of the bush administration because of 
controversy swirling around the potential positions on abortion of 
the new chief 
initial word of healys selection by health and human services 
secretary louis sullivan came from medicine and health a 
washingtonbased newsletter the new york times carried an account 
in its monday editions 
it was understood that healy was the choice of sullivan but 
that her nomination has not been formally sent to the white house 
for approval by president bush 
the position also is subject to senate confirmation 
healy who well known within the government health 
establishments was a member of an nih advisory committee that 
recommended government approval of fetal tissue research to see 
cures to various illnesses a recommendation that was overruled by 
both the reagan and bush administrations 
while members of that panel generally refrained from stating a 
direct position on abortion healy forcefully stated her view that 
it was demeaning to women to argue that the acceptance of fetal 
research as a federal policy would prompt someone to have an 
abortion who was otherwise opposed to the practice 
as word of her pending appointment began circulating the 
national right to life committee said it could not support her for 
the job but stopped short of outright opposition 
we fear that dr healy may for the moment agree to support 
the administration policies on these abortion issues but then 
work with proabortion members of congress to open loopholes big 
enough for truckloads of fetal tissue and abortion pill said 
douglas johnson legislative director of the antiabortion group 
he said that the nrlc cannot support this nomination but we 
do not currently intend to oppose dr healys confirmation in the 
senate 
his mention of an abortion pill was in reference to calls 
for federal approval of a frenchapproved socalled morning 
after abortion pill 
at least four previous candidates reportedly have turned down 
the nih appointment rather than adhere to the antiabortion 
position in general and the question of fetal tissue research in 
particular 
among them was dr william danforth chancellor of washington 
university in st louis and the brother of sen john danforth 
rmo who complained of being subjected to a litmus test on 
abortion 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater subsequently told 
reporters that candidates for jobs that are essentially technical 
or below the assistant secretary of health and human services 
level would not be held to the same standard on abortion as higher 
level political appointees 
healy was an assistant director of the white houses office of 
science and technology policy during the reagan administration from 
1984 to 1986 and began her medical career as a fellow in pathology 
in the national heart lung and blood institute in 1972 after 
receiving her medical degree from harvard medical school and 
interning at johns hopkins hospital 
the national institutes of health consisting of 14 separate 
branches that investigate the causes and treatments of illnesses 
such as cancer heart disease and aids is part of the department 
of health and human services

a whole nation breathes easier today 
americans came this close to having bart simpson with a tennis 
racket masquerading as their national champion instead they got a 
wellgroomed sometimes painfully polite kid who is a throwback to 
the courtly gentlemen of a byone era and still lives with his 
parents 
im just a normal 19yearold pete sampras said growing 
up with a very unusual job 
if only andre agassis life were that simple because the 
neongreen outfits and the vegas showgirl hair the endorsements 
the entourage and the oncourt emotions cannot hide the fact that 
agassi is still without the one thing he needs and wants most a 
grand slam title to validate his talent 
if you convinced me that he was that cool on the inside then 
i would be amazed the 20yearold agassi said still smarting 
from the 64 63 62 spanking sampras administered in the us 
open final sunday 
but i dont believe that and i dont think that even he 
admits to being that cool on the inside agassi continued its 
amazing that he could play so solidly and not show it 
believe it andre pete does and he just may be 
because just like that sampras became the youngest champion is 
us open history and in the bargain delivered what agassi and 
nearly everyone else in the suddenly resurgent american brat pack 
23yearolds aaron krickstein and jay berger 21yearold david 
wheaton and 20yearold jim courier have only promised 
with a serve like a siege gun and a few hundred swings on an 
overcast day in cool new york he joined 1989 french open winner 
michael chang in proving that excellence is what the game is about 
and that being ranked among the top two dozen players in the world 
should mean more than a spot in line at the payroll window 
until sampras turned the trick on the stadium court sunday at 
the national tennis center no yank man or woman had hoisted the 
silver trophy since john mcenroe in 1984 
sure it was tempting during the lean years to try to count the 
transplanted czechs ivan lendl 198587 and martina navratilova 
198384 198687 as american champions yet anyone so easily 
suckered was quickly reminded that the best hope of american tennis 
was supposed to be its junior development programs and not the us 
immigration and naturalization service 
but no more 
here where the melting pot boils over on occasion five of the 
quarterfinalists and three of the semifinalists were american brat 
packers counting the resilient mcenroe who at 31 may not be 
young but is still most certainly a brat 
of the foreign contingent still around by the final eight no 3 
seed lendl was ousted by sampras and unseeded soviet andrei 
cherkasov and defending champion and no 2 boris becker of west 
germany were dumped in succession by agassi 
it should have come as little surprise then that the strains 
of im proud to be an american were piped over the loudspeakers 
when sampras of rancho palos verdes calif and agassi of las 
vegas which for these purposes counts as part of the united 
states made their way onto the court sunday 
and even less surprise that sampras who had gunned down the 
stubborn mcenroe a day earlier was as cool as he claimed to be 
afterward 
from the first point i felt really good he said and who 
is going to argue after drilling his first serve of the match into 
the net sampras reared back again and dealt the first of 13 aces 
with his second serve 
i think that when i serve as well as i did this week it puts 
fear in the mind of my opponents he said when theyre 
serving they might get tight or something because im serving so 
well that plants the seed in their mind that if they play one bad 
game then the set may be over 
that actually may be understating the case against seven 
opponents sampras played a total of 238 games he served in 117 of 
those and held all but 12 or roughly nine games out of every 10 
by contrast sampras opponents served 121 times and he broke 
through 38 times or better than three out of every 10 service 
games 
no wonder he looked so cool 
if you looked at the tape youd see all his aces are on the 
line thats just rough the chance of returning serves hit at 100 
mph when it hits the line are slim agassi said not to mention 
when he blasts one at 120 mph 
despite the hightech racket those rockets issue from sampras 
is actually a throwback to the classic tennis player with his 
serveandvolley style onehanded backhand and in sharp contrast 
to the oftensullen occasionally obscene and 
sometimesspitspewing agassi even temperament 
the serve came suddenly i just got bigger stronger 
taller sampras recalled but he took one hand off the racket 
while playing in the junior ranks after being convinced it offered 
more versatility 
and though he grew up as a player during a time when ugly 
americans jimmy connors and john mcenroe had their way with the 
game and its officials sampras took his cues on how to behave from 
australian greats rod laver and ken rosewall whose matches he saw 
only on film 
i have tremendous respect for those guys i really do 
sampras said all those guys were class individuals and id like 
to be thought of in that category 
incredibly talk about bad intelligence information when no 1 
tennis buff george bush wanted to jump on the american bandwagon by 
calling one of the three homegrown semifinalists while en route to 
the summit in helsinki he chose agassi 
when first informed of the call sampras asked incredulously 
the president i didnt even know that 
and was he bothered by it 
no no no sampras replied recovering in time to prove 
just how cool he really is my phone was off the hook

the two germanys are increasingly preoccupied 
with the skeletons in their closets just three weeks before they 
move into the same house 
east germanys interior minister said in an interview that both 
nations are still spying on each other and west german lawmakers 
are split over a plan to grant amnesty to former east german spies 
a top west german official was quoted today as saying 3800 east 
german spies are still active in west germany with many eluding 
detection and some going to work for the soviet kgb 
meanwhile activists and politicians are trying to keep secret 
files maintained by the east german intelligence service from being 
turned over to the west german intelligence service 
the handwringing over espionage has been increasing as the oct 
3 date of german unification moves closer german media generate 
stories daily about double agents infiltrations and the notorious 
deeds of east germanys former communist secret police 
the two nations that were once the front line of the cold war 
also comprised perhaps the biggest arena for eastwest espionage 
east german interior minister petermichael diestel raised the 
debate another notch sunday when he was quoted as saying that west 
germany still has moles in east german ministries 
diestel also said there are quite a lot of east german spies 
in bonn the west german capital and that it was time for both 
countries to switch off their surveillance 
lutz stavenhagen who coordinates antiespionage policy for 
chancellor helmut kohl denied that west germany was still spying 
on east germany the cologne newspaper express reported today 
but stavenhagen said the soviet union had been trying to recruit 
east german intelligence agents working in west germany he 
characterized most of the estimated 3800 agents as unimportant 
according to the paper 
diestel meanwhile has come under renewed fire by east german 
activists for keeping scores of former communist secret police 
agents on his payroll 
some of the activists who helped oust the communist government 
last year have occupied the former headquarters of the east german 
secret police 
they are demanding that former agents be purged from the 
democratic government and that ordinary east germans get to see the 
files that were kept on them by the oncefeared domestic 
intelligence unit 
they also are demanding that the records not be turned over to 
the west german intelligence agency 
the one thing we dont need is the records going from one 
secret agency to another secret agency said hans schenke one of 
about 22 activists who have been occupying the headquarters of the 
secret police since tuesday 
two weeks ago the east german parliament threatened to reject a 
treaty laying the foundation for german unity unless west germany 
allowed the files to remain in what is now east germany the 
allgerman parliament that takes over after unification will decide 
what should be done with them 
in west germany political parties are feuding over a plan to 
grant amnesty to many of the east german spies in west germany 
lawmakers in the past several days have been debating a proposal 
by the west german justice ministry that would grant amnesty as 
long as the operatives were not involved in murder blackmail or 
other nefarious activities 
but politicians have been unable to decide how broad the plan 
should be whether it should include west germans charged with 
treason or west german peace disarmanent activists who may have 
been east german secret police operatives

secretary of state james a baker iii 
briefed nato allies today on the superpower summit in helsinki 
seeking greater assistance in the international campaign against 
iraq 
baker and other foreign ministers of the north atlantic treaty 
organization nations met for about two hours to discuss the summit 
between president george bush and his soviet counterpart mikhail 
gorbachev on sunday in the finnish capital 
greater allied assistance in the campaign against iraq was on 
todays agenda 
the 12 european community nations said in rome on friday that 
they would not help pay for the us military presence but the ec 
did agree to provide economic aid to egypt jordan and turkey 
three frontline states hit hardest by the crisis 
baker was to meet with ec commission president jacques delors at 
the trade blocs brussels headquarters following the nato briefing 
a us official speaking on condition of anonymity said baker 
would ask the nato allies for more money for egypt jordan and 
turkey not to fund the american military effort 
we have not made a request for financial aid to the us and 
we are not going to make that request the official said in 
brussels we had a request for financial aid to the frontline 
states and of course the europeans dealt with that in rome 
the iraqi sanctions and refugee aid could cost the three 
frontline states some 35 billion by the end of this year us 
officials have said and the costs could climb by an additional 7 
billion in 1991 
the added us costs in military operations in the persian gulf 
are expected to stand at 6 billion at the end of the year 
the american official said he expected baker to repeat his call 
for cargo ships and planes from the nato allies to beef up the 
military presence in the gulf 
i am sure that he will reinforce the earlier request of last 
week for sealift and airlift capability he said nato observers 
said the united states was disappointed with the initial response 
of some of its allies to the appeal 
britain italy and portugal already have offered planes and 
vessels to take us troops to the gulf 
britain and france have built up their military presence in the 
gulf region and smaller allies like the netherlands and belgium 
also have warships on the way to help enforce a un trade embargo 
against iraq 
bush and gorbachev said after their summit sunday that they were 
united in the belief that iraqs aggression must not be 
tolerated 
gorbachev said his former ally iraqi president saddam hussein 
is headed into a dead end in struggling to hold occupied kuwait 
against the insistence of the united nations that his forces 
withdraw

liberian president samuel k doe took power in a violent coup a 
decade ago and left power in the same manner 
his capture sunday by fighters loyal to rebel leader prince 
johnson comes 8 months after insurgents began their battle to 
unseat him the civil war has claimed more than 5000 lives and 
reopened the ethnic divisions that doe used to take power 
sixtyfour people including many of does bodyguards were 
killed in the battle sunday the british broadcasting corp said 
doe was reported wounded in both legs the fight took place outside 
the headquarters of the west african task force sent to end the 
countrys civil war 
doe claimed he had thwarted 30 attempts to topple him since 
april 12 1980 when he led a band of 17 sergeants who ended 
domination of this west african nation by the descendants of freed 
american slaves 
doe son of an army private personally led the charge into the 
executive mansion of president william tolbert who was killed the 
sergeants publicly executed 13 other prominent americoliberians 
several days later 
born in blood does rule was characterized by numerous murders 
and detentions of opposition leaders and suppression of the 
countrys press 
in august 1981 he had five of his closest associates shot for 
allegedly planning a coup against him later a president guard 
commander was executed in similar circumstances 
after more than five years of military rule doe permitted 
elections in 1985 the election rules doe had approved required 
presidential candidates to be at least 35 years old 
his official biography listed his birthdate as may 6 1952 the 
year was scratched out 1950 written in and the biography handed 
out to reporters 
when opposition parties appeared to have won the oct 15 1985 
voting does men burned and destroyed ballots the election 
commission doe had appointed declared him the winner 
on nov 12 1985 another former close associate a sergeant who 
like doe had been named a general after the revolution attacked 
monrovia his men took over local radio stations and appeared to 
control the city before doe counterattacked 
at least 1500 people were estimated to have died brig gen 
thomas quiwonkpa who led the coup attempt reportedly was 
disemboweled after being captured 
quiwonkpa had been a popular commander from nimba county and his 
killing made his home area a fertile base for the dec 24 1989 
invasion of liberia by rebel leader charles taylor 
doe in announcing he would not seek another term as president 
said he has survived 35 or 36 coup attempts and would be happy to 
leave the burden of leading a country the political 
harassment to someone else 
the former master sergeant described by foes as impulsive and 
by friends as brave visited the scene of a bloody assault by his 
own troops on refugees in monrovia he met with victims and 
promised to help them and vowed to executed the masked soldiers 
who had committed the attack 
remember that tough times dont last only tough people do 
doe once said at a news conference 
by all economic standards the country has declined sharply since 
doe took power but it was already broke when he arrived it had 
huge budget deficit and a foreign debt of 800 million 
the goal of his revolution had largely been simply to end the 
rule of the elite descendants of american slaves he also wanted 
better pay and conditions for soldiers 
doe worked hard taking college classes speech tutoring and 
shifting from army fatigues to a threepiece suit 
since july doe had been holed up in his mansion as street 
fighting raged in the capital his troops many of them members of 
his krahn tribe reportedly refused to let him flee without 
obtaining assurances for their own safety 
the rebels have accused doe of nepotism and stealing millions of 
dollars of state money they also hold him responsible for the 
deaths of thousands of civilians killed during the civil war

michigan democrats embraced their new 
nominee for lieutenant governor and honored the partys departing 
candidate in the hopes of ending a bitter dispute 
chanting libby libby libby delegates at the state party 
convention sunday nominated olivia maynard 54 of flint as their 
candidate to succeed twoterm lt gov martha griffiths 
the 78yearold former congresswoman was booted from the ticket 
last month by gov james blanchard 48 who said he feared 
griffiths was no longer able to step in as governor at a moments 
notice 
griffiths skipped sundays convention she had asked that a 
tribute to her be canceled saying she said did not want to listen 
to hypocrites honoring her 
delegates hugged and kissed maynard a former chairwoman of the 
states democratic party as she made her way to the platform 
libby maynard is a person who meets jim blanchards primary 
test of being someone who can assume the office of governor said 
macomb county prosecutor carl marlinga 
her career is a model of competence and caring he said 
maynard said she wanted to campaign about goodpaying jobs 
abortion rights better schools and care for the elderly 
though griffiths stayed away delegates stood and applauded when 
sen don riegle of michigan said she would be a tough act to follow 
our party and our country owes a great debt to martha 
griffiths for her many decades of extraordinary leadership and 
accomplishment he said 
i dont believe that a single other national leader has done 
more to advance the cause of womens rights in this country and 
every man and every woman and every child in this country owes much 
to her 
as a us representative griffiths was instrumental in adding 
provisions barring sex discrimination to the civil rights laws and 
in prying the equal rights amendment from a balky house committee 
the amendment failed to be ratified by enough states 
griffiths had questioned maynards qualifications saying she 
had never served in elective office and had no government 
experience except running a state office for the aging office 
griffiths later said she meant maynard had no parliamentary 
experience and predicted maynard would do a wonderful job 
maynard said she prefers to believe griffiths later comments 
were her true feelings 
blanchard declined to comment on griffiths remarks about 
maynard when he appeared at a postconvention news conference 
thats all behind us he said

the head of nicolae ceausescus 
despised securitate secret police went on trial before three 
military judges today on a charge of complicity in mass murder 
a 28page indictment read out at the opening of the court 
session charged that 52yearold iulian vlad had assisted 
genocide in his position as head of the security department 
all the orders regarding the activity of the troops of 
securitate were given by him the indictment said 
vlad who has been in custody since march faces 20 years in 
prison if found guilty the trial likely will last for months 
but the trial was adjourned until tuesday shortly after the 
proceedings began to give vlad more time to acquaint himself with 
the charges 
the military court presided over by gen adrian nitoiu also 
rejected a bid to have vlads case joined to that of 23 former 
officials of ceausescus administration top aides and members of 
his politburo 
vlad held the position of chief of six directorates of 
securitate from 1987 until the december 1989 revolution and 
commanded about 25000 troops

the indictment quoted vlad as telling ceausescu in two politburo 
teleconferences preceding the dictators ouster i assure you 
comrade general secretary that i will do my best to be worthy of 
your faithfulness 
it also charged that vlad ordered troops into the western city 
of timisoara where the demonstrations that led to the revolution 
first broke out with the intent of suppressing the revolutionary 
movement

officials was made by defense lawyers for former vice premier 
gheorghe oprea who said that vlad could not be judged separately 
from the officials charged with forming the policies he allegedly 
carried out 
dressed in a darkgray suit and guarded by two whitehelmeted 
police vlad occasionally exchanged glances with two of his defense 
lawyers 
he currently is being held in the hospital of jilava jail south 
of bucharest recovering from a gall bladder operation he underwent 
three months ago but defense lawyer gheorghe vilcu said his client

six hours of talks between the two leaders at the finnish 
presidential palace followed by a joint hourlong press conference 
about half the meeting time was spent between just the two 
presidents joined only by notetakers and translators 
the two released a joint statement criticizing the invasion of 
kuwait by iraq declaring no peaceful international order is 
possible if larger states can devour their smaller neighbors 
we are determined to see this aggression end and if the 
current steps fail to end it we are prepared to consider 
additional ones consistent with the un charter the statement 
said we must demonstrate beyond any doubt that aggression cannot 
and will not pay 
the statement did not describe those additional steps 
sections of the un charter authorize force in extreme cases 
but gorbachev made it clear that a military response was not what 
he had in mind and asserted there was a whole range of 
possibilities of finding a political solution 
though the potential use of force remained a difference bush 
said their agreement opposing iraqs invasion and endorsing the 
economic sanctions against iraq was the key element 
there are some differences but not on the fundamental 
point bush said on his way home the fundamental point is 
there is a clarion call for compliance with these sanctions 
the joint statement he said is going to send a very strong 
statement around the world and i couldnt be more pleased 
he said he hoped to see gorbachev again later this year or 
early next year whenever treaties on reducing conventional 
forces in europe and on limiting strategic arms are ready to be 
signed 
bush seemed to imply he was less than optimistic about chances 
of getting either treaty signed this year asked about the 
prospects of treaty signings he said well i hope so i dont 
know i cant guarantee it 
although bush declared the two countries were standing 
shoulder to shoulder in demanding the unconditional end of the 
iraqi invasion of kuwait clear differences remained on several 
issues 
gorbachev said he did not plan to remove the remaining 150 
soviet military advisers from iraq bush said their removal would 
facilitate things 
bush said that the israelipalestinian conflict was unrelated 
to the iraqi crisis even though it was one that must eventually 
be resolved gorbachev suggested there was a link and that we 
need to act more energetically to resolve both middle east 
problems 
still bush said common ground surges ahead of these 
differences 
at their news conference in helsinkis finlandia hall both 
leaders said they hoped their solidarity would help persuade saddam 
to end the occupation of his smaller neighbor 
although the soviets have been leery of the massive buildup of 
us troops in the region and have declined to send forces to saudi 
arabia the final summit statement sidestepped a direct stand on an 
increased military response 
white house aides were delighted with gorbachevs direct 
criticism of saddam 
gorbachev told the news conference he had criticized the iraqi 
leader in private just as he had done in public saddams actions 
are driving iraq into a dead end the soviet leader declared 
the soviet union and iraq have long been allies until the 
crisis moscow had been baghdads principal arms supplier 
gorbachev said the soviet union did not plan to send ground 
forces to saudi arabia to join the usled multinational force 
bush said he had not made such a request 
in a conciliatory gesture bush said the united states was ready 
to explore ways to help the hardpressed soviet economy last july 
at the economic summit of the worlds seven largest industrial 
democracies in houston the administration opposed such help 
bush said later on the plane there were no secret agreements 
at the summit and that other issues such as arms limitation 
negotiations were barely mentioned 
i couldnt ask for any more out of a statement than what we 
got bush said 
it was the first time the two superpowers had spoken in tandem 
on a major international issue since world war ii it was very 
successful for what we were trying to do bush said 
the joint statement called on iraq to withdraw unconditionally 
from kuwait to allow the restoration of kuwaits legitimate 
government and to free all hostages now held in iraq and kuwait 
it also said shipments of food and medical supplies for 
humanitarian purposes into iraq should be closely monitored by the 
un and other appropriate international agencies to ensure that 
food reaches only those for whom it is intended

secretary of state james a baker iii 
announced today he will visit syria to coordinate the us drive 
against iraq with president hafez assad despite differences with 
the syrian government over human rights and terrorism 
baker also reported that saudi arabia the united arab emirates 
and the overthrown government of kuwait would contribute 12 
billion to help pay for the us defense of the persian gulf and 
assist nations hurt financially by their adherence to a boycott of 
iraq 
baker said president bush had directed him to go to damascus 
thursday night after he winds up talks in moscow with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev and foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze 
the president felt it was an important time to have a 
facetoface dialogue baker said 
syria in a makeshift alliance with the united states has sent 
troops to saudi arabia and to the united arab emirates to guard 
their oil fields against an iraqi attack 
we continue to have some differences with syria and we expect 
to discuss those differences baker said 
over the years the state department has sharply condemned 
syrias domestic human rights record and accused it of sponsoring 
terrorism against american and israeli civilians 
meanwhile baker told a news conference he spoke by telephone 
with the ambassadors of saudi arabia and the united arab emirates 
and received word that they along with the overthrown kuwait 
monarchy will contribute 12 billion to the economic and military 
campaign against iraqs saddam hussein 
while touring the persian gulf last week baker received 
commitments of aid without specific amounts from king fahd of 
saudi arabia and president zayid of the united arab emirates emir 
jabir al sabah of the displaced kuwaiti government offered 6 
billion 
baker said roughly half of the 12 billion total would go to 
offset american efforts in the gulf which include the presence of 
us troops the other half would assist poorer nations observing 
the boycott of iraq 
the bush administration reached out to both syria and iran to 
join the campaign against iraq relying on their bitter differences 
with saddam hussein 
however the official iranian news agency reported today that 
iran has agreed to establish diplomatic relations with iraq ending 
a decadeold conflict with saddam 
a us official said baker had no plans to meet with iranian 
representatives 
baker held the news conference after briefing foreign ministers 
of the north atlantic treaty organization on the summit bush and 
gorbachev held sunday in helsinki finland baker asked the nato 
ministers to send ground troops to saudi arabia and to assist 
turkey and frontline arab states 
we will not be embracing syria and everything syria has done 
with which we disagree baker said pressed further on why he was 
going to damascus baker replied they are there 
he said it was important to show the extent to which iraq is 
isolated he made no mention of iraqs reported resumption of 
diplomatic ties with iran the two countries had a bloody 
eightyear war in the persian gulf 
asked if the united states would welcome iranian help baker 
said you bet we would 
the united states has no relations with iran while maintaining 
ties with syria 
the estimated us cost of defending the gulf this year is 6 
billion 
of the 16 nato nations only the united states turkey britain 
and france have troops in the region 
others have contributed ships to move troops eight countries 
meanwhile are holding exercises in the mediterranean 
baker said he suggested they extend their operations eastward 
closer to the crisis area 
manfred woerner the nato secretarygeneral said there was a 
unanimous conviction more can and should be done by the allies to 
support the united states but woerner stressed it would be up to 
each nation to decide what to do 
the state department in its annual human rights reports 
consistently has criticized syrias domestic practices while the 
office of counterterrorism has implicated palestinian groups 
operating out of the syriacontrolled bekaa valley of lebanon in 
attacks on americans and israelis 
one such incident was the bombing of a pan am passenger plane 
over lockerbie scotland in december 1988 the popular front for 
the liberation of palestine general command which is maintained 
by syria is suspected of the attack 
the group also faces charges in west germany of attempting to 
blow up troop trains carrying americans

her opponents are determined to have 
benazir bhutto remembered as the disgraced leader of pakistans 
most corrupt and incompetent government not as a martyr for 
democracy 
when she was dismissed after 20 months in office they set out 
to destroy what some called the myth that only a bhutto could 
govern pakistan 
in removing the prime minister and her democratically elected 
government aug 6 president ghulam ishaq khan cited a long list of 
complaints ranging from corruption and ineptitude to abuse of power 
ms bhutto called it a constitutional coup by the 
establishment a reference to the generals who formerly ruled 
pakistan and still have enormous influence 
a caretaker government made up largely of defected allies and 
bitter critics of ms bhutto has hurled charge after charge to an 
effort to discredit her pakistan peoples party which was founded 
by her father some say her enemies are trying to force her out of 
politics 
three former cabinet ministers have been charged in special 
courts set up to handle corruption cases and to disqualify 
candidates from elections called for oct 24 three years ahead of 
schedule 
today the armybacked caretaker government charged ms bhutto 
with corruption the first step toward possibly barring her from 
next months election she was charged before a special onejudge 
court set up in karachi to try cases of official graft and 
disqualify candidates from the scheduled oct 24 elections 
judge wajihuddin ahmed will decide later this week whether to 
accept the charges and serve formal notice to ms bhutto 
many pakistanis see the tribunals as kangaroo courts evoking 
memories of the process her father prime minister zulfikar ali 
bhutto underwent 13 years ago after gen mohammad zia ulhaq 
overthrew him bhutto was hanged two years later 
there are glaring similarities with 1977 but there also are 
differences ms bhutto said in a recent interview at her 
fortresslike home in karachi the wind of democracy has come 
across the world there is a new future ahead and it will not be 
easy for them to drag pakistan backward 
opponents have not presented concrete evidence to support their 
charges and the family name still carries much of its old magic 
for many wherever she goes ms bhutto draws large crowds that 
chant benazir benazir is innocent 
pakistanis have become increasingly cynical about the future of 
their stopandstart democracy 
since its creation as a moslem homeland 43 years ago when the 
indian subcontinent became independent of britain pakistan has 
endured three wars three internal insurgencies and three military 
dictators 
two prime ministers a president several highranking generals 
and countless politicians and religious leaders have been 
assassinated thirteen governments have been dismissed and three 
constitutions written 
many are wondering whether there is something sick something 
terminal festering deep down in the political soul of pakistan 
said political analyst akbar ahmed it is a cycle of despair 
military rule and terror civilian rule and anarchy 
nobody said it would be easy to lead this volatile country of 
110 million out of the social and economic problems a decade of 
martial law created but never was such a legacy of admiration and 
goodwill squandered so swiftly 
ms bhutto just 37 years old inexperienced and 
westerneducated pursued a policy of confrontation rather than 
compromise opponents considered her arrogant and vindictive and 
spared no effort to bring her down 
in her eagerness to become prime minister she promised to share 
power with the president and the army chief of staff gen mirza 
aslam beg she tried to play one against the other but they united 
against her 
she infuriated beg by meddling in army promotions something she 
promised not to do her policy on kashmir was unclear and her 
public statements of support for militant moslems in the disputed 
territory antagonized india pakistans hostile neighbor 
she displayed only nominal interest in finding a peaceful 
settlement to the 12yearold civil war in neighboring afghanistan 
and helping nearly 4 million afghan refugees return home from 
pakistan 
she appears to have tolerated corruption and greed among senior 
ministers and allegedly allowed her husband asif ali zardari to 
plunder staterun banks dole out public jobs and demand 
commissions on lucrative government contracts 
the last straw was a breakdown of law and order especially in 
southern sindh province ms bhuttos home and power base 
people in the villages expect corruption and arrogance from 
the rich and powerful but they also expect security and 
sympathy said ahmed the political analyst when social order 
is disrupted and kidnappings and senseless killings become 
commonplace the equation is disturbed 
when warfare broke out between rival ethnic groups in late may 
taking hundreds of lives ms bhutto showed little reaction the 
army called in to restore order was greeted as a savior 
close friends and associates warned ms bhutto that the 
president was going to use his constitutional power and dismiss her 
government but she did not believe them 
ms bhutto acknowledges her former ministers are not all 
angels but makes no apologies she denies wrongdoing and paints a 
picture of an administration that improved the nations lot 
i have no regrets i was not betrayed by the people she 
said given half the chance i am sure the people will elect us

the iraqi government has denied requests by 
the international committee of the red cross to aid foreign 
hostages and other foreigners in iraq and occupied kuwait the 
committee said today 
cornelio sommaruga icrc president expressed regret that the 
red cross was not being allowed to carry out its humanitarian 
mandate spokeswoman ann stingle said 
she said sommaruga met foreign minister tariq aziz and other 
iraqi officials during a threeday visit to baghdad last week 
the red cross sought access to foreign nationals being held 
against their will in iraq or kuwait and permission to assist 
foreigners allowed to leave who lack the means to do so no reason 
was given for iraqs rejection of the red cross requests 
we support the neutral role of the icrc in protecting and 
assisting victims of conflict within the framework of the geneva 
conventions and hope that they will soon be allowed to carry out 
their mandate said stephen h richards executive vice president 
of the american red cross 
under the geneva conventions the red cross has the right to 
assist foreign nationals displaced by international conflicts and 
to ensure that prisoners of war are not being mistreated 
ms stingle said kuwait is definitely a fourth geneva 
convention situation because it is an occupied country 
sommaruga also traveled to amman jordan and tehran to 
coordinate red cross operations to aid foreign refugees in jordan 
he also discussed the repatriation of iranian and iraqi prisoners 
of war

the warring factions in cambodia 
agreed today to share power in a transitional ruling council in an 
effort to end the long civil war in their country 
the question of temporary rule has stalled the peace process in 
the past 
a joint statement issued at the end of two days of negotiations 
in the indonesian capital identified six members of premier hun 
sens cambodian government as members of the 12seat supreme 
national council 
the remaining six seats are to come from the guerrilla 
resistance coalition with each faction allowed two members 
the parties also agreed that a peace plan recently adopted by 
the five permanent members of the un security council would serve 
in its entirety as the basis for settling the cambodian 
conflict 
the warring factions met today to discuss who will rule their 
country until elections can be held a day earlier indonesian 
foreign minister ali alatas had said that the four factions had 
indicated they could accept the un peace plan as a negotiating 
framework 
the plan was drawn up by the five permanent members of the un 
security council the united states the soviet union china 
france and britain negotiations are now aimed at forming an 
interim administration alatas said 
the talks have been a series of meetings between the factions 
and mediators alatas and edwige avice the french deputy foreign 
minister 
the vietnaminstalled phnom penh government was represented by 
premier hun sen for the three rebel factions khieu samphan 
represented the communist khmer rouge former premier son sann the 
anticommunist khmer peoples national liberation front and prince 
norodom ranariddh the followers of his father prince norodom 
sihanouk 
sihanouk the head of the guerrilla coalition said he was ill 
and could not travel from beijing for the meeting 
in a written statement today from beijing sihanouk 67 said 
his health was forcing him to take a sixmonth leave from politics 
but he supported all decisions being made in jakarta the notice 
did not explain the nature of sihanouks illness 
alatas said he was encouraged by the progress of the opening 
session and aksed the cambodians to set aside their mistrust and 
enmity 
anyone or any party seen to be blocking the path to peace will 
have to assume an awesome responsibility before history he said 
alatas has mediated a series of meetings since july 1988 those 
talks ended inconclusively when the four factions disagreed on how 
to share power in the period before elections 
under the un plan cambodian sovereignty would rest with an 
interim government formed by the warring factions for the 
preelection period but some vital powers would be held by a un 
peacekeeping force which would supervise and control if 
necessary the ministries of defense foreign affairs finance 
public security and information 
the un force also would verify a ceasefire and supervise 
disarmament of the four factions in a complicated disarmament 
procedure armies of the four would be regrouped in camps and 
gradually relinquish their weapons to the united nations 
the cambodian factions must decide the makeup of the interim 
government and under what circumstances it would cede power to the 
united nations 
hun sen has resisted the idea of his government giving up its 
power before elections hun sen conferred during a break in the 
talks sunday with john monjo the us ambassador to indonesia 
it was believed to be the first highlevel meeting between the 
united states and cambodia since washington withdrew its 
recognition from the resistance coalition in july 
the resistance coalition is battling the government vietnam 
installed in phnom penh after it invaded in late 1978 and toppled 
the khmer rouge 
the khmer rouge had during nearly four years of rule tried to 
transform cambodia into a radical agrarian society causing the 
deaths of nearly 1 million people due mostly to starvation and 
executions

where abbas has lived for several years 
this is my life he said at one point i live only for my 
dream

why wasnt the summit held in a sauna 
for finns sitting naked in a room full of hot rocks and steam is 
the best way to relax and reach agreement 
babies have been born in saunas and old people have been taken 
there to die finns often invite special foreign guests to their 
home saunas 
businessmen regularly make deals in temperatures that top 125 
degrees celsius 257 degrees fahrenheit and president mauno 
koivisto holds sauna evenings with politicians journalists and 
members of high society 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev held 
their summit in the presidents palace here but if the discussions 
had involved only the soviets and finns they might well have taken 
place in a sauna 
bush took a sauna at the kalastajatorppa hotel where he spent 
the night he had planned to go jogging but a light rain persuaded 
him to stay inside and take a sauna instead aides said 
koivistos predecessor urho kekkonen was famous for 
entertaining soviet leaders in the dry steam bath that originated 
in finland 
more than 2000 years ago ancient finns used saunas made of 
sticks moss and mud 
todays sauna can range from the small electrically heated 
cubicles in many modern apartments to the woodheated smoke 
sauna a hot black room with no chimney that is preferred by 
connoisseurs 
the sauna is heated by warming a stove with stones that steam 
when water is thrown on them the water is heated in a big 
brickinsulated cauldron 
some people spend only 10 minutes sweating in the relatively dry 
steam others take hours in a ritual that includes washing beating 
oneself with soft birch switches and swimming in a lake 
in winter daredevils cool off by rolling naked in the snow or 
swimming in a hole in the ice 
for many finns especially in the country the sauna was until 
recently the only source of hot water laundry was always washed in 
the sauna and no haymaking was complete without a sweat in the hot 
room 
saunas are ubiquitous in finnish life they are regular 
fixtures at large corporate headquarters and lakeshore summer 
homes on the weekend finns spend hours warming their saunas and 
wisps of smoke above the horizon are a common sight on a saturday 
evening 
most apartment blocks have saunas and families take turns going 
to the communal bathing rooms scrubbing one anothers backs is a 
major part of the ritual 
babies only a few weeks old are taken into saunas and they seem 
to thrive in the heat physicians say it resembles being in the 
womb 
finns get angry when the sauna they so treasure is linked abroad 
with sleazy sauna parlors and steam baths that have more to 
do with sex than washing 
the sauna is a piece of summer in the middle of winter a 
place for getting clean but above all it is cult place opera 
singer martti talvela said in an interview shortly before he died 
last year 
talvela who regularly entertained foreign guests in one of his 
five saunas felt the ritual was an integral part of being a finn 
it is the cleanest purest place he said for finns it is 
the holy origin

energy department officials cautiously 
predicted adequate gasoline and fuel oil supplies for the rest of 
the year but said today that could change if there is an unusually 
cold winter or war erupts in the mideast 
calvin a kent head of the energy information administration 
told a congressional hearing that the supply of refined petroleum 
products from gasoline and heating oil to jet fuel is tight and 
refineries are producing at nearmaximum capacity 
but he said us petroleum stocks appear adequate and that 
while the supply of crude oil is expected to be cut by 1 million 
barrels a day during the last three months of the year this 
shortage can be handled 
but kent preceded his optimistic assessment by listing in 
testimony before the house energy and power subcommittee a string 
of conditions that he said could cause the situation to change for 
the worse 
serious supply problems could develop he said if there is a 
further cut in foreign oil supplies if fighting erupts in the 
middle east if the country is hit by a colderthannormal winter 
if major refinery problems develop or if there is widespread 
hoarding of heating oil 
rep philip sharp dind the subcommittee chairman said he 
was not reassured by the testimony 
with over 90 percent of us refining capacity in constant 
use there is now a very small margin of safety he said 
noting that any unforeseen problem could cause energy shortages 
rep terry bruce dill said he was nervous about the slim 
margin in refining capacity i fear we will run out of heating 
oil gasoline and jet fuel said bruce 
kent said that current supplies of heating oil on the east 
coast which heavily depends on oil for heating are 16 percent 
above last year and that fuel stocks appear to be adequate 
barring any unusually cold weather or refinery breakdowns 
as for gasoline inventories were described as being at their 
lowest level since july 1988 59 million barrels above the 
minimum operating inventory required to prevent a scattering of 
shortages 
gasoline stocks while tight should be adequate to see us 
through the fourth quarter kent told the subcommittee but he 
said he would not rule out the possibility of some localized 
shortages 
us refineries were described as operating at better than 96 
percent capacity in both july and august well above the operating 
levels of previous summers but kent said us refineries should be 
able to make up for losses in refined products from kuwait and iraq 
dewey mark speaking for the national petroleum refiners assn 
said he wasnt as certain that lost imports of refined products 
could be made up by increased us production 
as a refinery when youre operating at 90 percent youre 
effectively running wide open he told the subcommittee 
if there is no major disruptive event in the market the 
refining industry will be capable of meeting nearterm demands 
said mark but the supply balance is tight

yasser arafats guerrillas controlled the 
largest palestinian refugee camp in lebanon today after crushing 
followers of the notorious terrorist mastermind abu nidal in three 
days of savage combat 
police said at least 80 people have been killed and 250 wounded 
since friday when arafats mainstream guerrillas cracked down on 
the fatahrevolutionary council in the ein elhilweh shantytown 
the fighting reached its peak sunday when the palestine 
liberation organization fighters fought handtohand to root out 
the last of abu nidals followers hiding in a tunnel network under 
the camp 
the guns fell silent after the 12hour battle on the 
southeastern flank of the port city of sidon 25 miles south of 
beirut 
arafats political representative here zeid wehbe said today 
that abu nidal followers who sought refugee in sidon should be 
removed because their presence in the city is an explosive 
destabilization factor 
in a press conference at his ein elhilweh residence wehbe 
accused abu nidals men of triggering fridays fighting by 
kidnapping five fatah activists 
other plo officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
dozens of abu nidals dissidents were being sheltered by sunni 
moslem fundamentalist leaders in sidon 
the citys 350000 predominantly sunni moslem population was on 
strike for a second day today to protest the violence mortar and 
artillery rounds crashed into residential districts in sidon during 
the fighting 
angry youths barricaded the highway entrances to lebanons third 
largest city with burning car tires as schools shops banks cafes 
and restaurants remained closed 
traffic ebbed to a trickle and hundreds of fishermen called off 
their daily excursions in the mediterranean waters 
posters reading hands off sidon palestinian brethren and 
spare us your wrath spanned the empty streets 
reporters and photographers touring the battlescarred camp 
found fatahrevolutionary council bases sealed off and guarded by 
fighters from the mainstream plo fatah faction 
unlike sidon all shops and businesses were open in the 
shantytown that houses nearly 32000 unregistered refugees it 
is the largest among the 13 refugee camps in lebanon 
police said fatah has taken prisoner more than 100 of abu 
nidals 300 fighters in ein elhilweh about 40 were killed and the 
rest fled to majdalyoun five miles east of sidon 
younis awad an aide to arafat called the outcome of the 
fighting a final victory that brought all refugee camps in 
south lebanon under undisputed plo control 
fatah crushed a 200man abu nidal unit in the rashidiyeh refugee 
camp near the port of tyre 25 miles south of sidon in june 
police officials expressed fears that arafats victory will 
trigger retaliation by the remnants of abu nidals organization 
were going to see a wave of assassinations bombings and 
kidnappings against arafats men said one official who declined 
to be named 
abu nidal whose real name is sabri albanna is now based in 
libya 
he broke away from fatah in 1973 and arafat sentenced him to 
death in absentia for killing several plo officials 
abu nidal tops the most wanted lists in the united states and 
europe he is suspected of being responsible for scores of 
terrorist atrocities including the december 1985 bombing attacks 
on rome and vienna airports in which 20 people were killed

east germanys troubled farmers got a break 
today when the government announced a 636 million deal to sell 
food and coveted cigarettes to the shortageplagued soviet union 
the deal will allow farmers to get rid of some of the unsold 
produce and meat that have been jamming storerooms and 
slaughterhouses in the past several months 
east german stores have been spurning homegrown goods in favor 
of western products 
about 255000 tons of meat 60000 tons of butter 5000 tons of 
fish and more than 1 million eggs are included in the contract with 
the soviet union estimated at 636 million officials said 
also included in the deal is sales of 1 billion cigarettes the 
soviet union has been plagued by unrest over mass shortages of 
tobacco 
the contract was announced by government officials and west 
german agriculture minister ignaz kiechle who will be in charge of 
east germanys crubmling farm economy after the two nations unify 
on oct 3 
officials said deliveries will begin in the next few days and 
continue through june 
guenther krause east germanys state secretary and top 
unification negotiator called the deal a spectacular contract 
east german farms sovietstyle collectives that are typically 
overstaffed have been unable to sell enough goods to cover their 
payrolls and operating costs since the nation switched to a free 
market on july 1 
west german food chains made deals with east german stores in 
march requiring them to stock many western products nudging east 
german goods off the shelves 
farmers have been slaughtering cows and pigs prematurely because 
they could not find places to sell them or afford to feed them and 
some economists say perhaps half of a record grain harvest has been 
unsold

candidates across the nation closed their campaigns with a 
blizzard of lastminute television ads in an effort to grab voters 
attention before tuesday primaries often overshadowed by events in 
the persian gulf 
ten states and the district of columbia will nominate candidates 
for hundreds of offices but only a handful of contests have 
attracted much attention 
election officials generally were predicting a low voter 
turnout the predictions ranged from under 40 percent in arizona to 
not much more than 15 percent in wisconsin where there were no 
tight statewide races 
the mideast conflict is overshadowing everything said 
robert frankel the democratic leader of the connecticut house 
the feeling i get from knocking on doors and talking to people is 
that there is a very low perception that there even is a primary 
in connecticut the major statewide contest is for the 
democratic nomination for governor rep bruce morrison campaigned 
as the guy who doesnt want to raise taxes his opponent state 
legislator william j cibes jr has called for a tax increase and 
an overhaul of the state tax system 
people who dont like tax reform nevertheless like the fact 
that i dont shrink from the issue said cibes 
rep john rowland already has the republican nomination for 
governor the frontrunner in the race is former sen lowell 
weicker who is running as an independent 
a different sort of tax controversy grabbed attention in the 
contest for nonvoting congressional delegate from the district of 
columbia former carter administration official eleanor holmes 
norton was favored to win the democratic nomination until it was 
disclosed that she and her husband failed to file city tax returns 
over an eightyear period 
norton said her husband edward always handled the familys 
finances and repeatedly assured her that the taxes had been paid 
i always asked whether the taxes had been filed norton said 
he always said yes 
the washington post on monday endorsed dc council member betty 
ann kane for the post and said nortons failure to file income tax 
returns is not just disabling it is disqualifying 
in minnesota where gov rudy perpich faces a strong primary 
challenge from mike hatch his former commerce commissioner the 
secretary of states office forecast a democratic turnout of less 
than 25 percent 
another endangered officeholder is rep roy dyson of maryland 
who is being challenged in the democratic primary by state 
legislator barbara kreamer dyson has been under investigation for 
his relations with defense contractors and was hurt recently by the 
disclosure that despite his hawkish record in congress he was a 
conscientious objector during the vietnam war 
in arizona where former gov evan mecham is bidding for the gop 
nomination to regain the office he lost through impeachment 
election officials predicted fewer than 40 percent of republicans 
would turn out for the primary 
other states holding primaries are new hampshire new york 
rhode island utah and vermont 
in new hampshire where there are primary contests for governor 
senate and an open congressional seat candidates scrambled over 
the weekend to buy up the remaining available time on wmur the 
states only television station 
former sen john durkin and nashua mayor james donchess agreed 
to allow their competing ads to run during the same commercial 
break sunday evening because that was the only prime time 
available durkin donchess and businessman john rauh are 
competing for the democratic nomination for the senate seat being 
vacated by republican gordon humphrey 
rep bob smith and lawyer tom christo are vying for the gop 
nomination for humphreys seat eight republicans and two democrats 
are seeking to replace smith in the house 
bill zeliff one of the gop contenders for the house seat got a 
boost over the weekend when he was endorsed by john sununu the 
former governor who now is white house chief of staff the 
candidate was airing radio commercials in which sununu says ive 
known bill zeliff for a long time nobody will work harder to get 
the job done 
republican gov judd gregg had only token opposition for 
renomination the frontrunner for the democratic gubernatorial 
nomination is former state party chairman joseph grandmaison 
hatch was running ads in minnesota that accused perpich of 
abandoning state development projects that didnt offer glitz 
when the glitz is gone so is rudy perpich a narrator says 
can we afford four more years we need guts not glitz 
hatch said he decided to run the ad after perpich began airing 
commercials in which he takes credit for creating 350000 jobs in 
minnesota since 1983 
as long as hes personally claiming that then its my 
obligation to say look thats baloney hatch said 
on the gop side state auditor arne carlson was the subject of 
attacks from both his major opponents 
with a poll showing carlson 18 points ahead of his closest 
opponent both businessman jon grunseth and former federal 
prosecutor doug kelley turned their sights on the leader 
the choice liberal arne carlson or jon grunseth the 
officially endorsed republican candidate for governor says a 
grunseth ad that tries to paint carlson as too liberal for gop 
voters on the issues of crime taxes and abortion 
the prospect of a low turnout in arizona was regarded as a 
factor that could help mecham in the gop primary against 
frontrunner fife symington a phoenix developer and three other 
candidates 
if the turnout is under 35 percent mecham could win it

arizona state university

a lawyer for a disturbed young man 
under suspicion in the stabbing deaths of five college students 
disputed the importance of a knife reportedly found in a milk 
carton at the suspects grandmothers home 
jr russo edward lewis humphreys lawyer said sunday he could 
not confirm reports of the knife but he said an emotionally 
disturbed individual might keep his toothbrush under the pillow and 
his shoes in the oven 
the gainesville sun reported sunday that police found the knife 
in a carton during a search of the home in indialantic about 180 
miles southeast of gainesville exactly where humphrey told 
investigators it would be 
lab tests will be performed to determine if the knife is linked 
to the slayings the newspaper said 
police in gainesville have said only that promising evidence 
has been found in searches 
steve platt of the state department of law enforcement crime lab 
in jacksonville said today that 17 to 20 people are working around 
the clock to analyze evidence taken from the three crime scenes and 
from humphreys gainesville apartment his grandmothers 
indiatlantic home and his car 
we are faced with what can be likened to three very complex 
puzzles that we are trying to put together one piece at a time 
he said its a slow painstaking effort 
neither police spokesmen or platt would confirm news reports 
about the knife found at the indialantic home 
humphrey has been identified as one of eight suspects but has 
not been charged in the slayings last month he is being held on 1 
million bail on charges of beating up his grandmother 
published reports have said that humphrey may have a multiple 
personality and has referred to himself as john and by other 
names including henry the sun also reported he sometimes makes 
references to a female personality 
the florida timesunion reported saturday that humphrey had told 
investigators he knew who killed the first two victims they 
believe that he was talking about one of his other personalities 
the newspaper said 
police have refused to comment on the report 
experts said the slayings were committed by a meticulous killer 
who may also be a sexual sadist because of the way three bodies 
were mutilated 
humphreys grandmother elna hlavaty 79 has said she wants to

kremlin advisers struggled today to persuade 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to endorse a sweeping 
economic reform plan backed by rival boris yeltsin and a highlevel 
task force 
the plan would transfer enormous authority from the national 
parliament to the legislatures of the 15 soviet republics 
according to a draft obtained by the associated press 
gorbachevs economic adviser stanislav shatalin author of the 
proposal said the draft was an early version but included the 
basics of his plan for an economic union 
it calls for gorbachevs central government to accept two 
controversial claims by the republics control of their own natural 
resources and the superiority of their laws over national ones 
however it is not clear whether the veto power extends to all 
issues or only economic ones 
although billed as an economic reform plan it amounts to a new 
political blueprint for the country if signed by gorbachev and 
representatives of the 15 republics it would amount to an 
agreement on the principles of a new union treaty the basic 
unifying document of the soviet union 
gorbachevs advisers were racing against a tuesday deadline 
when the soviet government is scheduled to present parliament with 
some plan for economic reform 
shatalin told reporters at the soviet parliament today that he 
believed gorbachev generally supported his radical proposal but he 
said he still did not know whether his plan would be the one 
presented to parliament on tuesday 
many legislators said they feared they would be offered only the 
much more conservative proposal of prime minister nikolai ryzhkov 
it calls for continued central planning and strong central 
government with a slow transition to a partial market economy 
ryzhkov and his staff believe that swift transition to a market 
would be like an overdose for an exhausted patient the 
official soviet news agency tass said in its report on the session 
the shatalin plan calls for creation of a voluntary economic 
union of the 15 republics of the soviet union each republic would 
control its own finances and natural resources and each would be 
entitled to a share of the national gold and hard currency 
reserves according to the early draft 
the implementation of all functions and authority of the 
members of the union is based on the principle of superiority of 
the legislation of the sovereign republics and effective 
distribution of functions between the republic and national 
governments the draft said however it did not say if this 
referred to all issues or only economic ones 
the national government would retain control of defense 
economic forecasting money supply customs and restoration of the 
environment it would run national scientific research and space 
programs atomic energy railroads and communications it would be 
allowed to control only those prices the republics allowed it to 
regulate 
the national government would have no power to tax citizens and 
companies instead the republics would pay dues based on their 
share of national income the draft says 
currently bureaucrats in moscow set prices and divvy up factory 
production among many customers as a result the market is in 
permanent disarray with every factory short of critical supplies 
the shatalin plan allows republic governments to make their own 
decisions on trade with other republics with prices and volume of 
trade set in contracts

gov james r thompson refused today to commute 
the death sentence of convicted murderer charles walker removing 
one of the last possible barriers to walkers scheduled execution 
this week 
the imposition of the death penalty in this case is 
appropriate thompson said in a news conference at the state of 
illinois center 
i made the decision myself in my office this morning the 
governor said in the end it was not a difficult decision except 
for knowing that theres nothing that stands between him and the 
sentence except me 
walker 50 has repeatedly requested that no further steps be 
taken to prevent or delay his execution by injection early 
wednesday he was sentenced for the 1983 murder of a young 
mascoutah couple in a 40 robbery 
if the sentence is carried out this week illinois would become 
the 16th state to execute someone since the us supreme court in 
1976 allowed use of the death penalty to resume no one has been 
executed in illinois since 1962 
i think mr walker has put himself to death im simply not 
standing in the way thompson said 
the governor added that walker might still have a chance to save 
himself if he changes his mind about not appealing the sentence 
several groups had asked thompson to commute walkers sentence 
including the states roman catholic bishops they wrote to 
thompson saying the death penalty undermines the sacredness of 
human life 
some lawyers believe that if walker were to pursue his appeals 
he could probably could get his death sentence reversed 
at walkers 1983 deathsentence hearing prosecutors offered 
testimony about the victims lives from the grandfather of the 
slain youth and the sister of his girlfriend walkers lawyer 
didnt object but four years later the us supreme court barred 
the use of such testimony in capital cases 
a prosecutor told jurors that if they didnt sentence walker to 
death he could receive as little as 20 years in prison and might 
eventually be paroled 
in fact state law then provided a minimum sentence of life in 
prison without parole but again no objections were raised and a 
juror later gave a sworn statement saying the prosecutors 
misstatement figured in the jurys decision to sentence walker to 
death

the trend to private enterprise is worldwide 
but significant changes will take time especially in eastern 
europe says an international finance official in the forefront of 
the transition 
the process of privatization in eastern europe is going to be 
slow and one should not expect results too quickly said sir 
william ryrie executive vice president of the international 
finance corporation 
after the dramatic collapse of communist governments last year 
the countries of central and eastern europe that decided to shift 
from state to private enterprise are finding it a complex process 
involving the selection of capital sources and the introduction of 
modern management ryrie said 
he appeared at a news conference marking mondays release of the 
annual report of the 135nation ifc the world bank affiliate that 
is the leading source of investment for private companies in the 
developing world 
the corporation approved the investment of 22 billion in 
fiscal 1990 for 122 projects in 38 countries demonstrating ryrie 
said the growing opportunities for profitable private investment 
in developing countries overall costs of ifcfinanced projects 
totaled nearly 94 billion reflecting the attraction to other 
investors of ifc participation 
eastern europe along with africa represents special challenges 
for ifc he said these countries are trying to make a very rapid 
move from socialist to market economy and need assistance of an 
organization like ours 
the ifc is very actively providing both investment and technical 
services to poland and hungary ryrie said soon after 
czechoslovakias forthcoming admission to membership the ifc will 
hold talks in prague on possible joint ventures with 
czechoslovakia bulgaria and romania are expected to join ifc later

americans soon could be getting their first 
televised glimpse of federal court proceedings 
a fivejudge study committee is recommending a threeyear 
carefully controlled experiment that would allow cameras and radio 
equipment to record civil trials in federal courtrooms 
the us judicial conference the policymaking arm of the 
federal courts will meet wednesday to consider the proposal if 
the conference agrees a handful of courtrooms could be open to 
cameras by july 
the plan envisions a variety of uses for the cameras including 
airing the highlights of testimony on the evening news or the full 
trial on cable tv 
the cameras also could tape the days proceedings for a federal 
court juror who is sick and unable to attend the trial 
and closed circuit video systems would allow officials to 
maintain security surveillance of the courtroom 
until last month the opposition to cameras in court by federal 
judges appeared unwavering 
but on the eve of the judicial conferences semiannual meeting 
that appears to be changing 
the conference is composed of 27 federal judges and is headed by 
chief justice william h rehnquist 
rehnquist said last may that he was by no means averse to the 
idea of an experimental program permitting cameras in court 
rehnquists predecessor warren e burger was dead set against the 
idea over my dead body burger reportedly said of a proposal 
to televise supreme court proceedings 
and while the study committee said most federal judges oppose 
lifting all restrictions on cameras in the courtroom it said most 
support the proposed experiment 
the panel headed by us district judge robert f peckham of 
san francisco voted 41 to open civil but not criminal 
proceedings to photographic and broadcast coverage 
like the chief justice a majority of your committee is not 
averse to controlled experimentation on a voluntary basis and would 
like to offer federal judges the opportunity to observe the effect 
of camera coverage and broadcasting of proceedings in federal 
court the panel wrote 
the experiment would be limited to two federal appeals courts 
and six trial courts judges who volunteer their courtrooms for the 
experiment would have broad control over what the public sees 
fortyfour states have allowed some camera coverage of their 
judicial proceedings but the federal court system a separate 
entity has been reluctant to go along 
the committees recommendation is excellent said timothy 
dyk a lawyer for news organizations lobbying for cameras in court 
it really proposes a very significant experiment 
no serious problems have been reported in state courts that have 
allowed cameras say dyk and other advocates 
federal judges who have resisted the idea give various reasons 
some have said they worry about losing their anonymity that 
lawyers will engage in grandstanding or that television will 
provide only snippets that will distort the proceedings 
whatever the outcome wednesday when the judicial conference 
studies the peckham committee plan supreme court proceedings are 
not likely to be primetime fare anytime soon 
the conference has no control over what the high court does and 
the justices generally have been hostile to television cameras in 
their courtroom 
sources at the high court say the justices were turned off to 
the idea after watching supreme court nominee robert bork get 
roughed up verbally at televised confirmation hearings before the 
senate judiciary committee in 1987 bork subsequently was rejected 
by the senate

the dough is rising the tomato sauce is simmering 
and deep pans are being oiled at pizza huts first two soviet 
restaurants which are set to open tuesday in moscow 
after three years of negotiations and seven months of 
construction 300 young workers are ready to serve up 
americanstyle pizza garlic bread salad and apple pies for both 
dollars and rubles 
the opening comes one day after pizza huts first restaurant 
opened in beijing the beijing restaurant served 200 pizzas to an 
invitationonly crowd of chinese and foreigners before running out 
of dough by midafternoon it was turning away disappointed people 
pepsico inc which owns pizza hut says the invitation to set 
up business in moscow was initiated by the former soviet ambassador 
to the united states anatoly dobrinyn who frequently ate with his 
family at pizza hut in washington dc 
the restaurants are technically owned by moscow pizza a 10 
million joint venture between moscows restaurant department and 
pepsicos european branch 
the soviet workers were selected from more than 3000 applicants 
and received weeks of training here and in london in more than just 
the cooking and serving of pizza andy rafalet regional operations 
director said they had to learn to smile not snarl like many 
soviet restaurant workers and recognize the body language of 
hungry or impatient customers 
similar training was given when mcdonalds introduced fast food 
to the soviet union eight months ago 
one of the new pizzerias is on gorky street a main thoroughfare 
minutes from the kremlin it seats 120 people and features a 
takeout window selling slices of pizza for rubles only 
the bigger of the two restaurants near a large foreigners 
compound on kutuzovsky prospekt will have a takeout service and 
separate dining rooms for ruble and dollarpaying customers 
the decor is like any other pizza hut down to the redandwhite 
checked tabletops red chrome chairs fake tropical plants and red 
roof logo but in a concession to the long soviet winters dozens 
of brass coatracks have been installed to accommodate bulky coats 
scarves and hats 
a special moscow pizza topped with salmon smoked sardines and 
onions has been added to a menu listing only nine combinations no 
substitutions are allowed soviets are not accustomed to large 
menus because most restaurants here offer limited choices and many 
of those are unavailable on any given day 
the salad bars in the moscow pizza huts are short on lettuce and 
heavy on the coleslaw the coffee hasnt arrived yet and the 
kutuzovsky restaurant ran out of pepsi one hour into a preopening 
press bash 
but moscows communist party youth newspaper had a sneak preview 
and gave it the thumbs up the first thing you are treated to is 
a smile and at once you start feeling easy and at home 
in less than a minute a pretty waitress came up to us and 
smiled moskovskaya komsomolets said she asked us what we 
would like to order but we looked blank salivating and asking her 
what each dish she mentioned was 
pizza hut has imported basic supplies but is relying on local 
flour and vegetables it commissioned its own beer from a local 
brewery and is involved in a soviet joint venture to make 
mozzarella cheese 
pizza hut says the four ovens in its bigger restaurant can 
produce 5000 pizzas daily and it expects to serve 50000 
customers a week about seven times the turnover of any pizza hut 
in the united states mcdonalds moscow outlet still sells 5000 
burgers an hour and the lunchtime lineup is 90 minutes long 
the restaurants are part of a 3 billion trade pact in which the 
soviet union will build at least 10 ships mostly oil tankers to 
be sold or leased by pepsico in return for foreign credits 
the twostory 180seat beijing restaurant expects to serve 
about 285 pizzas daily mainly to foreign tourists and foreign 
residents of beijing 
for some chinese the 460 price of a pizza was enough to turn 
them away from mondays grand opening thats almost onesixth of 
my salary i have to save before i can bring my 3yearold son here 
to have a meal said one man outside

the white house said today that iraq is 
showing signs of desperation by trying to mend relations with its 
former enemy iran and by offering free supplies of oil to third 
world nations 
the desperation attempts reaching out to iran and this free 
oil for the third world indicates that the pressure from 
international sanctions is pinching them someplace white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
such maneuvers have not worked in the past and will not work 
this time fitzwater said 
the spokesman said iran had pledged to abide by the global 
embargo against iraq and would be expected to honor that 
commitment 
theyve been enemies for so long its hard to believe irans 
going to be too supportive in this effort fitzwater said 
it shows iraqi president saddam husseins reaching to a 
country where he murdered millions of their people fitzwater 
added so hes grasping at any straw he can find 
despite the bloody eightyear war between iran and iraq iran 
announced it was establishing diplomatic relations with iraq 
the official iranian news agency said the agreement between iran 
and iraq was reached in a meeting between iranian foreign minister 
ali akbar velayati and his iraqi counterpart tariq aziz who ended 
a 24hour visit to iran today 
separately saddam offered to supply oil free of charge to third 
world countries in what he said was a gesture of solidarity 
fitzwater predicted the offer would be spurned 
it is an affront to all countries for saddam to think that 
they would sacrifice the principles of freedom and nonaggression 
for the iraqi oil or the oil that he has taken through his naked 
aggression against kuwait the press spokesman said 
dismissing saddams offer fitzwater said it means nothing 
the sanctions approved by the united nations clearly cover the 
oil at any cost

one month ago dr william logan told georgias 
aids task force that two medical schools wanted to duplicate his 
bloodheating approach to fighting the disease and said 50 patients 
could be treated by years end 
now logan admits bluntly his research is almost certainly 
finished because of a scathing report by federal investigators 
as far as i can tell at this point in time its dead 
logan said 
logan and another atlanta physician dr kenneth alonso 
announced earlier this year that they had treated two aids patients 
with hyperthermia heating a patients blood to raise his body 
temperature 
the first patient carl crawford 33 disclosed the treatment to 
reporters pointing to visible improvements and pronouncing himself 
cured of the deadly and so far incurable disease a second patient 
who kept his identity confidential was largely unchanged 
skepticism was widespread 
but logan a heart surgeon felt confident in his research when 
he appeared by invitation before the georgia aids task force in 
august he and alonso had dissolved their collaboration alonso 
went on to mexico and treated a third patient who died but logan 
promised to press on with careful work at us research 
institutions 
critics wanted someone else to duplicate the experiments and 
logan told the task force that two university medical centers were 
in negotiation to do just that regulatory problems unrelated to 
the hyperthermia treatments had cropped up at atlanta hospital the 
small medical center where the experiments were performed but 
logan said another hospital would soon take on the project 
logan was careful not to claim hed invented a cure for aids 
i feel like weve opened a little crack in the door he said 
but two weeks earlier several investigators from the national 
institute for allergy and infectious diseases a leading 
government aids research agency had visited atlanta at alonsos 
invitation to check out hyperthermia 
on aug 4 the institutes report came out 
the investigators said hyperthermia appears to have offered no 
clinical immunologic or virologic benefits they said crawfords 
skin lesions werent the rare aidsrelated kaposis sarcoma they 
were cat scratch fever 
there was no reason for further human experimentation in this 
area at this time they concluded 
dr anthony fauci director of the institute accused the 
hyperthermia team of having led to a lot of confusion 
frustration and false hope on the part of hivinfected 
individuals 
this is another example of why weve got to be careful before 
we jump on claims of a new treatment or cure fauci said 
in an interview last week logan could scarcely hide his anger 
i am totally flabbergasted he said adding that the report 
carrying the weight of the institute and its parent national 
institutes of health would almost certainly scare off any research 
institution or hospital from doing hyperthermia tests 
this is why i am so terribly upset im going to fight 
this every way that i can but i dont know what were going to 
do he said 
one medical school mentioned as a site for logans hyperthermia 
trials was mercer university in macon the plan never got past the 
informal talking stage and now it probably never will said the 
medical schools dean dr douglas skelton 
logan suggested that fauci should be fired 
he does not have an open mind logan said he really has 
betrayed an awful lot of people you know what they say about 
nih nothing invented here i dont think hes doing a damned thing 
up there 
press representatives at niaid did not return calls monday 
seeking comment from fauci regarding logans criticism 
logan thinks somebody will carry on his work 
the medical community is not going to buy this he said of 
the report 
that could still be under the auspices of alonso who said last 
week he most likely would perform hyperthermia treatments for 
aids again 
on monday alonsos wife carmen alonso who has served as 
spokeswoman through the publicity surrounding the procedure said 
he has five new sites major hospitals in miami dallas los 
angeles italy and costa rica she did not further identify the 
hospitals 
the report by the national institute for allergy and infectious 
diseases also appears to have dampened the hopes of some aids 
patients and advocates although few aids groups had embraced the 
hyperthermia theory to start with 
dr melanie thompson president of the atlanta aids research 
consortium a physician who treats aids patients told reporters 
she was disappointed 
but i am thankful someone has finally reviewed the information 
in depth and given us the answers we have been waiting for she 
said

unconfirmed reports said today that 
president samuel doe has been killed by rebels from a breakaway 
faction who captured him in a battle in monrovia this weekend 
in washington state department officials said they were aware 
of the reports coming from a camp outside monrovia of rebel leader 
prince johnson but could not confirm them 
the british broadcasting corp quoting witnesses who came to 
the liberian capital from the camp reported that does mutilated 
body is on display there 
johnson had telephoned the bbc to say he had captured doe in a 
battle sunday because liberias leader of 10 years was trying to 
flee the country possibly on a ship of a west african task force 
sent to end the 8monthold war 
meanwhile liberias main rebel fighters demanded today that 
west african troops withdraw from monrovia and said they would 
keep fighting despite the capture of doe by a rival rebel faction 
tom woewiyu chief spokesman of charles taylors national 
patriotic front dashed hopes for an early end to the tribal 
conflict in which three warring parties have killed more than 5000 
civilians 
woewiyus announcement that taylors rebels would keep fighting 
despite the capture of doe came in a telephone interview from 
burkina faso one of eight west african nations he has visited in 
an effort to get the west african force to withdraw from monrovia 
their mission has failed and a prime example is thahe capture 
of doe by the prince johnson group right in their headquarters 
woewiyu said 
prince johnson whose men captured doe in a battle at the 
headquarters of the west african task force in monrovia port 
declared he would run liberia until elections are held he said he 
would courtmartial doe who was reportedly shot in both legs in 
the fighting 
johnson controls monrovia but taylors 10000strong army has 
overrun much of the rest of liberia 
in harare zimbabwe the chairman of the economic community of 
west african nations which sent a fivenation task force to end 
the fighting said today does overthrow may bring peace to liberia 
taylor began the struggle to topple doe accusing him of 
corruption and human rights abuses doe a former army sergeant 
seized power in a bloody 1980 coup and claimed to have thwarted 
more than 30 attempts to topple him since 
more than 5000 people have been killed since taylor crossed 
into liberia from the ivory coast in december and the 3000member 
west african task force was dispatched aug 24 to end bloodletting 
that has followed ethnic lines 
sixtyfour people including dozens of does bodyguards were 
killed in sundays fighting between doe loyalists and johnsons 
fighters witnesses said doe had left his fortified seaside 
mansion to pay an unscheduled visit to the commander of the task 
force lt gen arnold quainoo of ghana at the headquarters of the 
west african task force in monrovia 
johnson and some of his fighters followed doe and his 
bodyguards and a quarrel erupted outside the headquarters the two 
sides then started battling with rifles machine guns and grenades 
the rebels hunted down doe and his followers from room to room 
of the headquarters slaughtering most of them then they seized 
doe who had been shot in both legs and carried him off to their 
base camp 
gambian president sir dawda jawara who leads the west african 
group said today does ouster might help the peace process in 
liberia 
all the factions that were involved in the fighting including 
other interest groups were insisting that doe must go jawara 
said 
he said the west african community would try to consult both 
rebel leaders about an interim government he made no reference to 
johnsons declaring himself president 
johnson seized control of most of monrovia after a split with 
taylor 
the west african task force said today that does aides were 
trying to negotiate the evacuation by ship of the presidents 
relatives who remain holed up in his mansion 
meanwhile doe loyalists named brig gen david nimley acting 
president following does capture 
liberia has been without effective government for months and 
monrovia has been besieged by the three armies since midjuly 
when the west african task force sailed into monrovia two weeks 
ago doe and johnson agreed to an informal ceasefire but taylors 
forces claimed the west african task force supported doe and 
continued fighting 
the war has left monrovia without running water and telephone 
communications and the west african task force had been working to 
try to create secure enough conditions to bring in international 
relief workers 
very little food has made it to the capital a city of 400000 
people for about two months 
about 2100 us marines are based on ships off monrovia and 
assigned to guard the us embassy and residential compound they 
have evacuated hundreds of foreigners from the city but have orders 
not to intervene in the war 
liberia a nation of about 2 million people has strategic 
importance for the united states it is the base for all diplomatic 
messages to and from us missions in africa 
in addition there is a huge voice of america transmission 
station a few miles from monrovia and the country has a powerful 
marine transmitter responsible for guiding all us shipping in the 
atlantic ocean 
liberia was founded by freed american slaves in 1847

in three months 5yearold nicolette 
folsom has lost her mother and father because of aids and her 
little sister also is battling the disease 
on sunday nicolette was one of 300 attending a memorial service 
for her mother jennifer who died last week of aids

the disease nicolette was not infected 
the girls now live with folsoms parents don and june kenney 
in fayston 
the memorial service brought together in the small wooden 
waitsfield federated church a community in mourning 
i wish this could be the closing chapter in the story about 
aids for don and june and their family said the rev paul martz 
but until a medical treatment is found aids will be part of this 
communitys landscape 
mrs folsom believed she contracted the disease through a blood 
transfusion during an emergency appendectomy in a massachusetts 
hospital in 1979 before blood supplies were tested and purged of 
the virus 
she told her story publicly in july saying she wanted people to 
know that the aids epidemic exists in rural areas and to educate 
people about the need to fight its spread 
she acknowledged at that time that her own death was inevitable 
i think about it more lately that death is reality this is 
reality you cant wash it off in the shower its here and its 
real and theres no light at the end of that tunnel she said 
i just wish it would go away and i know its not going to go 
away 
leith said sunday that mrs folsoms story prompted telephone 
calls letters and donations from around the country as of last 
week more than 32000 had been collected for the family most to 
be used for jennifers and angelas medical bills and a college

lt gov evelyn murphy dropped out of the race for 
governor today days after igniting a firestorm by staging a 
statehouse coup against gov michael s dukakis 
this is no time for business as usual and it is no time for 
politics as usual therefore today i am withdrawing as a 
candidate murphy told a news conference this afternoon 
this is not a political ploy she said it is an honest and 
necessary act of leadership 
for the sept 18 democratic primary she threw her support 
behind former state attorney general francis x bellotti who she 
said represents the best hope for change in the statehouse 
last week after dukakis left on a trade mission in west 
germany murphy seized the crown of acting governor unveiling 
proposals to slash state spending to help overcome the state budget 
crunch 
the plans which murphy predicted would save the state up to 
150 million included executive orders to fire an estimated 1000 
workers and cut salaries for some others 
murphy acknowledged dukakis could simply undo her work once he 
returns friday but insisted she was trying to save the state from 
sinking further in its fiscal mess 
critics called her move an act of desperation because of her 
standing in the polls that would be rejected by voters 
she was running behind both bellotti and boston university 
president john silber for the democratic nomination to succeed 
dukakis who is not running for another term 
along with many democrats she was an avid dukakis supporter 
during his 1988 presidential bid but the states fiscal woes have 
made dukakis the source of public disdain and murphy has joined 
the politicians treating the governor like a pariah 
because of the lateness of her withdrawal murphy will remain on 
the ballot next week

german officials on monday announced a 
spectacular deal to help troubled east german farmers supply 
shortageplagued soviets with food and precious cigarettes 
the contract estimated at 636 million will allow east germans 
to rid their packed storehouses and processing plants of millions 
of tons in unsold fish livestock butter milk and flour 
east german stores for the past several months have been 
spurning homegrown goods in favor of western products and the 
nations farm sector has been reeling to the point of collapse 
farmers have been the most restive section of the workforce 
about 255000 tons of meat 60000 tons of butter 5000 tons of 
fish and more than 1 million eggs are included in the contract 
officials said 
also included in the deal is the sale of 1 billion cigarettes 
the soviet union has been plagued by unrest over shortages of 
tobacco 
the contract was announced by government officials and west 
german agriculture minister ignaz kiechle who will be in charge of 
east germanys crumbling farm economy after the two nations unify 
oct 3 
officials said deliveries will begin in the next few days and 
continue through june 
guenther krause east germanys state secretary called the deal 
a spectacular contract 
east german farms sovietstyle collectives that are typically 
overstaffed have been unable to sell enough goods to cover their 
payrolls and operating costs since the nation switched to a free 
market july 1 
west german food chains made deals with east german stores in 
march requiring them to stock many western products nudging east 
german goods off the shelves 
farmers have been slaughtering cows and pigs prematurely because 
they could not find places to sell them or afford to feed them and 
some economists say perhaps half of a record grain harvest has been 
unsold 
officials also announced that west german would give about 950 
million in aid to the east german agriculture sector

in a major step toward ending its 
decadelong conflict with saddam hussein iran has agreed to 
formally establish diplomatic relations with iraq the official 
iranian news agency said today 
also today iraqi president saddam hussein offered to supply oil 
free of charge to third world countries in what he said was a 
gesture of solidarity however he said the countries would have to 
supply their own tankers and his statement appeared to be an 
attempt to circumvent the un embargo on trade with iraq 
saddam addressed his message to third world governments but did 
not specify the countries he said he was making the offer 
regardless of the various governments stands in the persian gulf 
crisis 
we hereby declare that we are prepared to supply all third 
world countries with oil free of charge in accordance with the 
needs of each country saddam said in his latest televised 
message read by an announcer 
the islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia cyprus 
said the agreement between iran and iraq on diplomatic tieswas 
reached in a meeting between iranian foreign minister ali akbar 
velayati and his iraqi counterpart tariq aziz who ended a 24hour 
visit to iran today 
diplomatic relations between iran and iraq were never officially 
severed even though the two countries were at war from 1980 to 
1988 they closed their embassies in 1986 and their respective 
diplomats returned home but there was no formal declaration that 
relations were broken 
diplomats described aziz visit as an attempt by baghdad to get 
help beating international trade sanctions imposed on iraq after it 
invaded kuwait aug 2 
there were unconfirmed reports that shipments of rice and flour 
already were being sent to iraq via iran such shipments would end 
the economic isolation iraq has suffered under the unordered 
trade embargo 
irans leaders have said they will honor the embargo although 
they object to the us military buildup in saudi arabia 
also today the syrian government said it was sending more 
troops to saudi arabia at the request of the desert kingdom 
diplomatic sources estimate that syria has already sent 45000 
elite combat troops to the kingdom and they expected this figure 
to almost double in the near future 
secretary of state james a baker iii announced today he will 
visit syria to coordinate the us drive against iraq with 
president hafez assad syria and the united states have formed a 
makeshift alliance during the persian gulf crisis despite 
differences over human rights and terrorism 
the official iraqi news agency ina questioned president bushs 
motives in meeting sunday with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev in helsinki finland after seven hours of talks the two 
leaders stood firm in demanding an immediate and unconditional 
iraqi withdrawal from kuwait and did not rule out the use of force 
if a peaceful solution is not found 
ina said the summit showed bushs evil tendencies and his 
spite for the arab nation and its central issues primarily the 
tragedy of the palestinian people who are suffering under the 
zionist occupation enforced by us support 
the united states has led the military and diplomatic effort to 
force iraq to return kuwait to its former rulers 
kuwait radio run by the emirates governmentinexile reported 
sunday that three member of saddams elite presidential guard were 
executed for plotting to kill him 
the radio gave no details and did not say when they men were 
allegedly shot western diplomats in saudi arabia said they had 
heard similar reports but were not able to confirm them two 
egyptian state newspapers quoting western diplomats said five 
officers had been ordered executed 
in another development syrias official news agency reported 
that 46 explosions were heard sunday in the iraqi town of alqaim 
near the boredr between the two countries resulting in an 
undetermined number of casualties abc news identified the site of 
the blasts as a chemical plant ina denied the reports 
polish workers returning home from iraq had said about 35 
americans were taken to the chemical plant in alqaim on aug 17 
under guard it was not known whether any westerners were still 
being held at the plant 
saddam has placed hundreds of westerners at industrial and 
military installations to serve as human shields against possible 
attack 
at the united nations today kuwaits ambassador said iraqi 
occupation forces have intensified their crackdown on kuwaitis 
killing civilians in the streets and rounding up others in mass 
arrests 
the iranian news agency quoting a what it said was a reliable 
source said that aziz in his talks with ali akbar velayati 
called for the restoration of bilateral relations and reopening of 
embassies in the two countries 
officials of the islamic republic of iran gave a positive 
response to the iraqi foreign ministers call and announced their 
consent in this connection irna said in an englishlanguage 
dispatch 
it quoted the source as saying preparation for the exchange of 
diplomatic missions will begin in the near future but gave no 
other details 
aziz flew home today after meeting iranian president hashemi 
rafsanjani and velayati irna reported 
it was the first visit to iran by an iraqi official since the 
islamic revolution seized power in 1979 a year later the persian 
gulf war broke out between the two countries 
an august 1988 ceasefire halted fighting 
baghdad began its campaign to improve relations with tehran 
shortly after the un sanctions were ordered 
iraq withdrew its troops from iranian territory it had held 
since the ceasefire began prisoner exchanges and agreed to abide 
by a 1975 treaty splitting the shatt alarab waterway with iran 
the shattalarab is a key outlet to the sea for iraq

55093 sole parent sponsors in the us armed forces 37257 
men and 17836 women 
though he did not have figures for past years hart said it 
would be a fair assumption that that number has risen you could 
parallel the increase in single parents in the civilian population 
with the military population 
hart said all singleparent soldiers must designate a legal 
guardian for their children in the event the parents are called to 
active duty such arrangements are made on a basebybase level 
day care and counseling services are also sometimes available 
but army capt barbara goodno points out the military isnt a 
nursery school or the boy scouts 
the most important thing to remember is single parents along 
with everyone else in the military volunteered for service

worldwide missions

presidents bush and gorbachev may not be on a 
george and mikhail basis but their relationship seems to 
be evolving into a comfortable one especially now that theyve 
ended a summit as allies 
bushs personal encounters with gorbachev remain a little on the 
staid side by bushs usual standards for palling around with world 
leaders associates of the president suggest 
but the two leaders seem to be settling in and getting used to 
each other and by their own accounts the presidents of the 
worlds two superpowers say they trust each other more and more 
at each meeting we move forward we enrich our relationship 
mikhail s gorbachev said after the two leaders ended their sunday 
summit in helsinki with a statement of unity condemning iraqs 
occupation of kuwait 
and i think i should say that we increased our trust 
gorbachev added 
bush who voiced skepticism toward the soviet leaders motives 
early in his term and whose press spokesman once called gorbachev a 
drugstore cowboy now says the two have reached a level of 
mutual understanding 
neither of us when we talk try to hide our differences 
bush said at sundays concluding news conference with gorbachev 
neither of us try to indicate that we look at exactly every 
problem exactly the same way but the very fact that we can talk 
with that degree of frankness without rancor i think enhances 
mutual understanding 
later bush told reporters aboard air force one that gorbachev 
felt confident he projected a certain confidence 
even in discussing economic problems within the soviet union 
gorbachev felt very open about doing it bush said 
the informality of last decembers shipboard summit at malta and 
pitching horseshoes together at camp david in june helped nurture 
their developing relationship the president suggested 
even so theres little hint that the two presidents are 
developing into fast friends or that they are able to wile away 
their hours in small talk its just not that kind of relationship 
in fact personal relations between the two men remain a bit on 
the formal side largely because gorbachev is inclined to want to 
get right down to work say aides who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity 
dont expect to see gorbachev out on the golf course or on a 
tennis court with bush or riding the waves in the us presidents 
speedboat 
white house insiders said that when bush and gorbachev meet 
there is little banter between the two about family sports or the 
myriad other subjects that bush enjoys discussing with other world 
leaders 
gorbachev reportedly showed little interest in visiting bushs 
vacation home on the maine coast during his visit here earlier this 
year 
they did pitch horseshoes together but the game was brief and 
perhaps partly arranged for the photo it produced which for a 
while bush hung on the wall of the presidential jet 
when the two greet each other its not by first names but as 
mr president 
bushs predecessor ronald reagan started off referring to the 
soviet union as the evil empire and wound up with a 
relationship with gorbachev that even bush has hinted was a bit too 
cozy 
reagan told the soviet leader he wanted to be on a ron and 
mikhail basis but it never caught on with gorbachev who 
continued to address reagan as mr president 
bush and gorbachev seem to be growing more comfortable in each 
others presence both on camera and off 
when they met sunday at the presidential palace in helsinki to 
begin seven hours of persian gulf summitry gorbachev presented 
bush with a framed copy of a soviet cartoon depicting the two 
leaders as boxing champs arms uplifted standing over a supine 
figure labelled cold war in russian thats wonderful bush 
said 
later at their news conference bush hit the side of his 
microphone at one point when it seemed to fail hit it again 
gorbachev to him 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said monday that 
worldwide support for the unity expressed by gorbachev and bush at 
the weekend summit has been overwhelmingly supportive and almost 
euphoric 
its a very important source of strength for many countries 
around the world who have had ties in both countries or had 
relationships one way or another to have this happen fitzwater 
said 
and while bush seems cautious in expressing too much 
satisfaction with his blooming relationship with the soviet leader 
he says i dont know how one quantifies mutual understanding 
but i feel were moving on the right track

a judge monday ruled that the sale of 
homes in the love canal chemical dump neighborhood may go ahead 
rejecting a bid by environmental and community groups to block the 
sales 
state justice joseph mintz lifted an injunction he imposed four 
years ago to block the sales he said the environmental groups had 
no standing to intervene 
the injunction which mintz had imposed at the request of the 
state attorney generals office forbade the love canal area 
revitalization agency from selling homes near the notorious toxic 
waste site until the state health department had studied whether 
the area was habitable 
love canal became a symbol of the nations toxic waste problems 
in the late 1970s when chemicals dumped there 30 years earlier 
began leaking into yards and basements hooker chemical co had 
dumped 22000 tons of chemical wastes that included toxic dioxins 
and pcbs into the former love canal before it was filled in and the 
town grew over the site 
an estimated 2500 people fled their homes 
the health department study which was finished last year said 
chemical contamination in a part of the love canal area was no 
worse than in other parts of niagara falls 
that was meaningless without measuring toxicity in those other 
parts of the city environmentalists protested they never 
determined that those comparative areas were safe argued richard 
j lippes a lawyer for the environmental groups 
paul h reid the revitalization agencys lawyer said there was 
no way to make an absolute determination that any area was safe 
there actually do not exist the kinds of standards that mr 
lippes would like us to supply reid said 
lippes also argued that the revitalization agency had not 
complied with other environmental studies required by state law 
mintz said those other studies were irrelevant to his original 
restraining order 
i decided some four years ago that this was an issue of health 
and welfare of prospective inhabitants the judge said i have 
papers before me that raise issues of fauna and animal life and 
architectural integrity that have nothing to do with this lawsuit 
nothing whatever 
william l broderick the revitalization agencys executive 
director said the ruling was gratifying but not unexpected 
the agency last month put 10 houses near the canal on the 
market the first of about 250 that it plans to renovate and sell 
agency officials said last week they had received offers on five 
of the 10 so far and broderick said the agency hopes to start 
closing on those houses soon 
lippes said after the hearing there was no way to appeal mintz 
ruling but that it left open the option of filing a separate 
lawsuit on the same issues he said the groups including the 
natural resources defense council the sierra club and local 
community organizations also would seek a federal court injunction 
to stop the resettlement

more americans know their cholesterol 
level but fewer know their blood pressure and some doctors are 
concerned that people dont understand the whole picture according 
to a survey released monday 
with all the attention given to cholesterol blood pressure 
diet smoking and exercise there is a chance that consumers will 
become confused said dr edward frohlich vice president for 
academic affairs at alton ochsner medical foundation in new orleans 
consumers should realize that its not only the person with 
elevated cholesterol or the person with high blood pressure or 
the individual who smokes or has hereditary predisposition 
frohlich said all are risk factors and frequently they all 
coexist in the same person 
the survey commissioned by voluntary hospitals of america inc 
found that 40 percent of americans age 20 and older know their 
cholesterol level an increase of 8 percent from a similar survey 
last year the new survey found 59 percent know their blood 
pressure a decline of 5 percentage points from last year 
voluntary hospitals commissioned the gallup survey to evaluate

energy department officials cautiously 
predicted monday that fuel oil supplies will be adequate this 
winter but only if the weather isnt severe if refineries avoid 
operating problems and if mideast developments dont disrupt oil 
shipments further 
several congressmen complained that the assessment was based on 
rosy assumptions and suggested that it provides little comfort 
to americans relying on oil to heat homes and factories 
there now is a very small margin of safety said rep philip 
sharp dind and chairman of the house energy and power 
subcommittee the energy department tends to underestimate what 
can go wrong he complained 
calvin a kent head of the departments energy information 
administration told sharps subcommittee that the supply of 
refined petroleum products gasoline heating oil and jet fuel 
will be tight with refineries producing near their capacities 
but he said us petroleum stocks appear adequate the 
agency estimated that while the worldwide crude oil shortage is 
expected to still be about 1 million barrels a day during the last 
three months of the year the shortage can be handled as higher 
prices dampen demand 
but kent said significant supply problems could emerge if 
developments in the mideast further reduce supplies or if the 
winter is abnormally cold operational problems at refineries 
which have been running at better than 96 percent of capacity and 
extensive hoarding could cause localized shortages he suggested 
the agency collects and analyzes world energy data 
sharp and several other congressmen reiterated their call for 
president bush to release oil from the strategic petroleum reserve 
the president should consider at least a modest drawdown of the 
590million barrel reserve to get confidence up and hopefully 
force prices down sharp said 
the bush administration has said tapping the reserve is not 
needed at this time energy department officials said last week the 
reserves will be used if there are significant supply 
interruptions 
rep terry bruce dill said he was nervous about the slim 
margin in refining capacity i fear we will run out of heating 
oil gasoline and jet fuel said bruce 
but kent said the capacity to refine crude both in the united 
states and elsewhere appears to be adequate and will remain 
so over the next three to six months 
he said kuwaits refining capacity could be replaced by 
increases elsewhere and rejected suggestions by some energy experts 
that the heavier crude that will replace the oil lost from iraq and 
kuwait might cause refinery operating problems 
dewey mark speaking for the national petroleum refiners 
association said he wasnt as certain that lost imports of refined 
products could be made up the supply balance is tight 
as a refinery when youre operating at 90 percent youre 
effectively running wide open he told the subcommittee 
kent gave these assessments on the expected supply of various 
refined crude oil products

current stocks are well above normal and rising supplies in

localized supply problems could develop inventories are at the 
lowest level since july 1988 59 million barrels above the

lt gov evelyn murphy dropped out of the 
governors race monday after her mutiny against gov michael s 
dukakis ignited rebellion in her own camp 
the stunning reversal came less than a week after murphy tried 
to prove she could lead state government seizing the crown of 
acting governor when dukakis went to europe on a weeklong trade 
mission 
murphy proposed various steps to slash state spending and solve 
the governments fiscal woes but those maneuvers which were 
blasted as a political stunt designed to rescue her campaign 
caused a wave of defections from within her ranks 
announcing her withdrawal from the democratic race at the same 
podium where she revealed the budget proposals friday murphy said 
now there can be no confusion this is not a political ploy it 
is an honest and necessary act of leadership 
but murphy campaign staffers said the main reason for the 
withdrawal was the simple fact that she could not win 
michael goldman a campaign strategist said surveys conducted 
over the weekend showed murphys support growing but not enough to 
land her the nomination in the sept 18 primary 
he said murphy made the decision monday morning and aides 
relayed it to one of her rivals former state attorney general 
francis bellotti who has been leading in opinion polls 
murphy said she would support bellotti adding he comes 
closest to the values that are important to me 
there was no discussion about giving murphy a job if bellotti 
should win goldman said 
the third democratic candidate is boston university 
presidentonleave john silber who has staked out the conservative 
wing of the democratic party along with independent voters 
mruphys announcement came on the same day that boston mayor 
raymond flynn along with other leading liberals said he would 
back bellotti 
murphy had portrayed herself as a champion of the liberal wing 
of the party but her support had begun disintegrating even before 
last weeks revolt 
murphy took command of state government when dukakis left on a 
trade mission to europe before his departure she said she was 
waiting for him to leave so she could seize control of the states 
ailing finances dukakis postponed the trip briefly then decided 
to leave after warning that he would return if murphy took any 
drastic actions 
murphys budgetcutting plans which she predicted would save up 
to 150 million included executive orders to fire an estimated 
1000 workers and cut salaries for others murphy also asked 
agencies to cut their 1992 budgets 10 percent below spending levels 
for the current fiscal year 
murphy reviewed those plans monday with l edward lashman the 
state secretary of administration and finance 
last week lashman said the projected savings under murphys 
proposals were highly inflated administration officials also said 
the orders requiring personnel cuts could not take effect before 
dukakis returns friday and the governor could undo those orders 
dukakis had issued his own budgetcutting orders before the 
revolt and administration officials said during the weekend they 
were still following the governors instructions

federal health officials on monday formed an 
office to monitor coordinate and enhance research on womens 
health responding to pressure from members of congress 
announcement of the new office at the national institutes of 
health came on the heels of word that a woman cleveland 
cardiologist dr bernadine p healy is the leading candidate to 
head nih 
at a meeting of nih officials and members of the congressional 
caucus for womens issues nih acting director william raub said 
researchers recognize the need to include women in clinical 
studies and to be attentive to womens health concerns 
nih will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that 
appropriate numbers of women are included in research projects 
funded by the institutes he said 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo cochairwoman of the caucus 
said nih officials have been very responsive of late to 
concerns about a lack of women included in experimental drug tests 
and their call for more attention to womens health issues 
but she sought guarantees that the politics of such 
controversial health issues as abortion wont impede nih efforts to 
address womens health concerns 
the huge raging political debate over reproduction has been 
a major obstacle to contraceptive research 
i can understand why a lot of researchers would just as soon 
not walk out into that area she said its affected research 
across the board dealing with women 
with the new office of womens health research in place and 
stronger requirements that nihfunded research projects include 
more women were going to be able to move forward schroeder 
said 
raub acknowledged the political dilemma and said we will have 
to be prepared to wrestle with ethics and were prepared to 
confront that 
sen barbara mikulski dmd pressed raub and dr james mason 
assistant secretary of health in the department of health and human 
services about a timetable for getting the new office running and 
making the other efforts 
were looking for action plans she said 
when mason assured her that nih officials were committed to 
carrying through with their plans she said i dont think thats 
good enough and pressed for a timetable 
mason said he wanted officials to take the time necessary to 
come up with the best possible plan we want quality he said 
mikulski shot back we want action 
one of the reasons researchers have been reluctant to include 
women in clinical trials of new drug therapies is concern that if 
they became pregnant their fetus could be harmed 
i think there has been timidity in the past perhaps related 
to the thalidomide disaster and its effect on women during 
pregnancy mason said referring to birth defects caused by the 
drug 
however he added that doesnt mean it shouldnt be done i 
think its clear it must be done 
dr anthony fauci director of the national institute on allergy 
and infectious disease the lead institute on aids research said 
one hindrance to including women in tests of experimental aids 
drugs is the lack of access to health care by the bulk of women who 
are getting the disease many of the women becoming infected are 
intravenous drug abusers or the sexual partners of drug abusers 
who are at high risk of contracting aids 
with no connection to the health care system researchers have a 
difficult time finding infected women to participate in clinical 
trials he said 
dr ruth kirschstein director of the national institute of 
general medical sciences was appointed acting head of the office 
of womens health research 
dr bernadine p healy 46 research director of the cleveland 
clinic foundation is health and human services secretary louis 
sullivans choice to head nih according to hhs sources who spoke 
on the condition of anonymity 
her name has not been sent to the white house but it was 
expected to be the sources said if confirmed by the senate she 
would become the first woman in that post 
healy was a member of an nih advisory committee that recommended 
government approval of fetal tissue transplantation research the 
recommendation was rejected by the reagan and bush administrations

eleanor holmes norton said monday she wont be 
chased from the race for the district of columbias nonvoting 
house seat by revelations that she filed no local income tax 
returns for eight years 
i am in this race to stay norton said at a campaign rally 
on the eve of the districts democratic primary 
those that think they could chase this woman out of this race 
dont know a fighter when they see one 
norton a georgetown university law professor had been the 
frontrunner in the campaign for the democratic nomination to 
succeed walter e fauntroy who is seeking the partys nomination 
for mayor in tuesdays primary 
but her campaign for the last three days has been trying to 
explain why she filed no local tax returns from 1982 through 1989 
on monday the washington post endorsed veteran city council 
member betty ann kane for the democratic nomination the paper said 
it had been prepared to endorse norton until her tax problems 
became public 
nortons failure to file returns is not just disabling it is 
disqualifying the newspaper said 
jesse jackson who is running for an unpaid shadow senate 
seat to lobby congress for dc statehood also had been set to 
endorse norton but changed his mind in light of the weekend 
developments jackson aides said 
he just couldnt do it now said one jackson aide who asked 
not to be identified they are old colleagues but there are too 
many unanswered questions 
norton who headed the us equal employment opportunity 
commission during the carter administration has said that she 
signed tax returns prepared by her husband edward for the years 
1982 through 1987 she said she was unaware that he had not mailed 
them to the city government 
norton said she even asked her husband are the taxes in and 
he said yes if i had knowingly done this why would i be 
running 
norton also said she has overpaid her taxes and that the city 
owes her a refund for an unspecified portion of the nearly 50000 
in local income taxes that was withheld from her pay during that 
eightyear period this weekend she sent the city a check for the 
more than 25000 she owed in connection with a 1982 tax dispute

terry waite the anglican church envoy held 
hostage in beirut for more than 3 years has been ill but is 
alive released irish hostage brian keenan said monday 
he was in the same apartment as i was being held in keenan 
said in an interview with britains independent television news 
waites cousin john waite said this was the first confirmation in 
more than three years that terry was alive it is wonderful 
news he said 
keenan 39 was released last month after 4 years in captivity 
itn said keenan had not previously revealed information about waite 
because the hostages had a pact to tell hostages families of their 
conditions first 
keenan said he heard the guards calling waite by his first name 
he said he is sure they were talking to waite and not terry 
anderson because he heard waite speak and recognized his english 
accent 
i know terry waite is alive i know he has been ill and the 
illness i do not think is serious keenan said 
archbishop of canterbury robert runcie said the news would put 
fresh heart into attempts to free the 13 remaining hostages in 
beirut they include six americans among them anderson chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press he was 
kidnapped march 16 1985 and is the longestheld captive 
waite 51 disappeared jan 20 1987 after leaving his west 
beirut hotel to negotiate with the moslem extremist group islamic 
jihad for the release of hostages no group has claimed to hold 
waite but he is widely believed held by islamic jihad 
keenan from northern ireland was interviewed at a retreat in 
irelands county donegal keenan said he believed that during his 
illness waite had frequent visits from the captors and from 
senior officers 
waite he said had been kept for a long time in a room in 
which there was a small generator to generate electricity because 
the power situation in lebanon they dont have any 
so he was sitting listening to this for nearly six hours a 
day pounding pounding pounding in his ear 
keenan said he knew waite had been ill because i heard him 
coughing very heavily at night i heard him being addressed by the 
guards as terry 
we always counted the number of people being taken to the 
toilet we knew there was another hostage they called him terry 
and we knew it wasnt terry anderson 
although we didnt visually see him we heard and i could hear 
under the door his door was adjacent to mine 
in the room he was being kept i heard his english accent it 
sounds to me like its terry waites voice i know he is a 
softspoken man 
keenan said he knew waites voice and accent because before he 
left to take a university teaching post in beirut he saw waite 
interviewed on television 
keenan said his captors told him that the british hostages could 
be free within months the door is wide open he said there 
is something happening there is a change in the organization that 
is holding the hostages 
in an interview with the british broadcasting corp john waite 
urged the british government to redouble its efforts to free 
hostages 
john lyttle a spokesman for the archbishop of canterbury said 
keenans statement was very plain evidence that terry waite is 
alive 
i think there are considerable indications from tehran that 
they are anxious now to dispose of this problem altogether to use 
their influence to bring about the release of the remaining 
hostages and i think there are reasonable hopes of progress fairly 
soon lyttle said

education secretary lauro cavazos called 
monday for close scrutiny of operations at 60 schools with high 
student loan default rates as well as the policies of seven 
agencies overseeing the troubled institutions 
cavazos said a new analysis of student loan data showed more 
than 30 percent of all defaulted loans 365 million was owed by 
borrowers who attended less than 1 percent of the nations 10000 
postsecondary institutions the borrowers were to begin repaying 
their guaranteed student loans two years ago 
the majority of the 60 schools are technical trade or vocational 
institutions that are accredited by seven of the nations more than 
100 accrediting agencies 
cavazos originally targeted 89 institutions but 28 have closed 
and one the usa training academy home study of delaware is 
inactive because it no longer receives federal funds 
cavazos said the federal advisory committee that oversees 
accrediting agencies has been directed to scrutinize the policies 
of the seven agencies 
the secretarys latest action comes as the education department 
struggles to keep afloat the higher education assistance 
foundation a private nonprofit agency based in overland park 
kan which is the guarantor of 88 billion in students loans or 
more than 17 percent of the 51 billion student loans outstanding 
nationally 
the total of student loan defaults is 78 billion of which 
19 billion was added last year an estimated 12 billion will be 
loaned to some 5 million students during the 1990 fiscal year 
the federal advisory panel the national advisory committee on 
accreditation and institutional eligibility recommends to the 
secretary which accrediting agencies should be recognized the 
agencies in turn accredit schools so they can participate in 
federal student aid programs 
cavazos directed leonard haynes iii assistant secretary for 
postsecondary education to meet with heads of the accrediting 
agencies and urge them to review their policies and procedures for 
institutional accreditation 
it is reasonable to expect that the level of student loan 
defaults at a school is related to the quality of its program 
said cavazos i am convinced that any accrediting agency that 
takes its role seriously must focus on educational effectiveness 
and must be concerned that institutions with high default rates are 
held accountable 
the accrediting agencies are the accrediting bureau of health 
education schools the accrediting council for continuing education 
and training the association of independent colleges and schools 
accrediting commission the national accrediting commission of 
cosmetology arts and sciences the national association of trade 
and technical schools accrediting commission the national home 
study council accrediting council and the southern association of 
colleges and schools commission on occupational education 
institutions 
cavazos said the department is conducting program or 
administration review of the 89 institutions that remain open 
the highest default institutions included cambridge technical 
institute dayton ohio with an 815 percent default rate 
amounting to 83 million and sawyer college cleveland heights 
ohio with a 799 percent default rate amounting to 18 million 
also metils welding school houston texas with a 69 percent 
rate at 41 million the vocational training center st louis 
mo with a 68 percent rate at 37 million and tarkio college in 
tarkio mo with a 673 percent rate totaling 43 million

arab intelligence reports indicate iraqs plan 
of attack was far more ambitious than taking kuwait and that 
saddam hussein talked with other arab leaders about splitting the 
spoils rep les aucoin said monday 
aucoin dore a member of the appropriations subcommittee on 
defense who returned sunday night from a trip to the persian gulf 
said arab officials told the delegation of conversations saddam 
hussein had with other arab leaders outside saudi arabia to buy 
into this plan of attack 
he said the other leaders rebuffed husseins offers 
they were talking about splitting the spoils it was an 
operation far more ambitious than kuwait i cant say any more 
aucoin said 
he said he and other members of a congressional delegation to 
the gulf area concluded that the attack on kuwait was a precursor 
to a move on the saudi oil fields 
his ends are very clear he said of saddam i am convinced 
if it had not been for the early military buildup the iraqis 
would have marched right beyond the saudi border and seized the 
saudi arabian oil fields 
what threw hussein off guard was that he could not believe the 
saudis would ever allow us deployment of forces there he said 
aucoin also said that us and arab intelligence reports 
indicate the trade embargo may well knock saddam from power by the 
end of the year 
it is not absolutely inevitable but there is a strong 
possibility that increased sanctions could put enough heat on this 
guy to cause him to be toppled the congressman said at a news 
conference 
aucoin said before he arrived in the persian gulf he was under 
the impression that saudi arabia wanted us troops there to direct 
a preemptive strike on iraq 
but i was encouraged by the consensus there of every one of 
the arab nations that the embargo ought to be allowed to play 
out before a military strike he said

allowing humanitarian food aid into iraq may 
lead to enough illicit trade with the persian gulf nation to help 
saddam hussein hang on longer in kuwait us analysts monday 
but it also relieves iraqs critics of the moral dilemma of 
threatening innocent civilians with starvation in order to put 
pressure on saddam they said 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev agreed 
at their summit meeting sunday in helsinki finland that a 
monthold un embargo against iraq permits food shipments in 
humanitarian circumstances especially to feed children 
the united nations security council must define humanitarian 
circumstances but in the meantime some nations are likely to act 
on their own analysts said 
countries for one reason or another may use the cover of this 
humanitarian aid to break the embargo said shireen hunter a 
middle east scholar at the center for strategic and international 
studies a private research group 
this is indeed a dilemma for bush as he seeks to keep a 
tight economic noose around iraq in order to compel saddam to 
withdraw his occupying army from kuwait she said iraq invaded on 
aug 2 and annexed the tiny kingdom six days later 
more than a month after the un security council voted to ban 
trade with iraq it is unclear how long it might take for the 
embargo to cause substantial hardship for iraq 
judith kipper a middle east expert at the brookings 
institution a research group said she sees less than a 50 
percent chance the embargo will work but rep john murtha 
dpa said sunday after returning with other lawmakers from a 
visit to saudi arabia that the sanctions could topple saddam within 
two months 
iraq imported about 80 percent of its food last year 
analysts said leakage in the embargo as a result of a 
humanitarian loophole is likely to be small but it may be 
enough to extend saddams grip on power that in turn may mean a 
longer stay in the saudi arabian desert for the tens of thousands 
of american troops that bush dispatched last month 
unconfirmed reports from the middle east on monday said some 
shipments of rice and flour already were flowing into iraq from 
iran the two countries which were at war from 198088 announced 
they were restoring diplomatic relations 
in brussels belgium on monday secretary of state james a 
baker iii told reporters that arab governments consulted by 
washington in recent days believe iran will continue to abide by 
the international consensus and respect the embargo 
bush apparently worried that sundays summit announcement would 
be seen as a weakening of us resolve against iraq said i hope 
that nobody around the world interprets this as our view that now 
there should be wholesale food shipments to iraq 
last week china and iran indicated they might begin sending 
food and medicine to iraq several other countries including 
tunisia yugoslavia romania and india have said they might send 
emergency food to their citizens trapped in kuwait 
bush and gorbachev stressed that any shipments must be monitored 
by international agencies in order to ensure that the food gets to 
the intended people 
saddam has repeatedly attacked bush for spearheading the un 
embargo saying the cutoff of food was endangering the lives of 
children by agreeing that limited food shipments can go forward 
the us and soviet leaders took away a propaganda tool and averted 
a possible moral problem 
a red cross official said monday that the genevabased relief 
organization saw no evidence that people in iraq or kuwait were 
starving or being deprived of medicines 
it is not at a critical stage said ann stingle a 
spokeswoman for the american red cross in washington she said the 
organizations assessment was based on the firsthand observations 
of a delegation of the international committee of the red cross 
which spent three days in baghdad last week in an unsuccessful 
attempt to win iraqi government approval for a red cross relief 
role there 
mrs stingle said the red cross will not participate in 
monitoring deliveries of unsponsored humanitarian food shipments 
to iraq until the government agrees to permit the red cross to help 
all segments of the civilian population there

the mayors of moscow and leningrad called monday 
for abandoning the traditional celebration of revolution day on 
nov 7 saying shortages and long lines give russians nothing to 
celebrate this year 
the anniversary of the 1917 revolution is one of the major 
holidays on the soviet calendar a day usually devoted to praising 
the glories of communism 
but this year instead of plastering cities with propaganda 
posters and carrying giant portraits of marx engels and lenin 
through the streets the mayors suggested that russians spend the 
day planting bushes and insulating buildings for winter 
its obvious to us that in 1990 the traditional celebration 
and traditional decorating of cities for nov 7 is unacceptable 
gavriil popov of moscow and anatoly sobchak of leningrad said in an 
open letter to city councils throughout russia 
the entire current situation crisis in the economy 
difficulties in gathering the harvest shortages and lines does 
not lend itself to any sort of exultation they wrote 
moscow leningrad volgograd tula archangel and other cities 
across the soviet union are suffering bread shortages for the first 
time in decades although a record grain harvest of 215 million 
tons is expected poor transportation and lack of fuel have slowed 
the process of getting the grain to market 
supplies of meat paper and gasoline have also grown tight 
causing long lines and sending black market prices soaring a 
shortage of tobacco this summer led to street protests in several 
cities and rationing in moscow 
popov and sobchak added that they were calling on soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev to limit the festivities in moscow 
to a military parade there was no immediate response from the 
presidents office 
in the past revolution day has been marked in the capital by a 
parade of military equipment including tanks and rockets followed 
by a vast peoples demonstration in which hundreds of thousands 
of moscow residents streamed through the citys main avenues and 
across red square 
there at the heart of soviet power members of the communist 
partys ruling politburo and top generals stood on lenins tomb 
a few years ago the mayors proposal to skip the celebration in 
favor of a utilitarian effort to prepare for winter would have been 
considered sacrilege 
but in the atmosphere of gorbachevs reforms many soviet 
citizens have become openly irreverent toward symbols and 
celebrations of communist power 
since they blame communism for economic backwardness and decades 
of political repression they feel little inclination to celebrate 
the day the bolsheviks seized power oct 25 by the old czarist 
calendar nov 7 by the new one introduced after the revolution 
may day another major soviet holiday was marked this year by 
counterdemonstrations involving tens of thousands of people in 
moscow as they passed through red square many shouted resign 
and jeered at gorbachev he stood stoically for 20 minutes and then 
left the reviewing stand 
popov and sobchak who are considered leading proponents of 
reform called on all political parties both those supporting 
the october revolution and those categorically opposed to it to 
restrain themselves from any political acts on nov 6 7 and 8 
this year 
the mayors said that whether nov 7 remains a national holiday 
will be decided by a new treaty defining the relationship between 
the 15 soviet republics and the central government 
but for this year at least they said they would prefer to skip 
the merrymaking and remember 1941 when the holiday was 
transformed into saying goodbye to troops leaving red square to go 
into battle

the white house on monday said iraqi president 
saddam hussein was grasping at any straw he can find in mending 
relations with iran once a bitter enemy and offering free oil to 
third world nations 
the man is desperate reaching out wherever he can white 
house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
as his spokesman belittled saddam president bush worked on the 
speech he will deliver tuesday night before a joint session of 
congress on the persian gulf crisis 
hes going to be very candid with them about exactly what 
were doing there and why and what our purposes are fitzwater 
said he said there would be no surprises or new initiatives 
the president also will use the gulf crisis to prod congress to 
reach a budget agreement fitzwater said 
bush meanwhile asked congress for 142 million so that the 
governmentfinanced voice of america can broadcast its radio 
programs 24 hours a day in the persian gulf and throughout the 
middle east 
currently voa broadcasts only 7 hours a day to pay for 
increasing the arabic service bush proposed cutbacks in radio 
programs beamed to eastern europe and the soviet union 
also on monday bush called the leaders of france egypt 
turkey saudi arabia and canada to brief them on his weekend summit 
with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev bush and gorbachev said 
they were prepared to take additional steps against iraq if the 
sanctions fail to force baghdad to withdraw from kuwait 
reporting on bushs conversations fitzwater said the 
response has been overwhelmingly supportive and almost euphoric in 
many cases in terms of the soviet union and the united states being 
able to come together this way 
its a very important source of strength for many countries 
around the world who have had ties in both countries or had 
relationships one way or another to have this happen he said 
referring to the summit accord 
iraq meanwhile sought to break the trade embargo imposed on it 
by the un by offering free oil supplies to third world nations 
in another development iran agreed to restore diplomatic relations 
with iraq its bitter enemy in a bloody eightyear war 
fitzwater predicted iraq would not benefit much from improved 
relations with iran theyve been enemies for so long its hard 
to believe irans going to be too supportive in this effort 
it shows saddam hussein is reaching out to a country where he 
murdered millions of their people fitzwater added so hes 
grasping at any straw he can find 
he noted that iran has said it will abide by the un sanctions 
and will be expected to honor that commitment 
as for saddams offer of free oil for developing countries 
fitzwater said it means nothing the sanctions clearly cover the 
oil at any cost 
in a written statement fitzwater said saddam husseins 
latest statement is a transparent attempt to deflect the focus of 
world attention from his blatant aggression against another 
country such maneuvers have not worked in the past and will not 
work this time 
it is an affront to all countries for saddam to think that 
they would sacrifice the principles of freedom and nonaggression 
for the iraqi oil or the oil that he has taken through his naked 
aggression the statement said

annual rate following a revised 02 percent gain or 116 million 
in june the central bank originally had reported the june increase

november and approximated the 442 billion monthly average of 1988 
and 1989 the fed said consumer credit growth slowed to an average 
of 178 billion a month during the first seven months of 1990 
there are two explanations for the sharp increase said sung 
won sohn chief economist for norwest corp in minneapolis one 
is that it simply is a statistical aberration and will decline in 
coming months to 1 billion to 2 billion a month 
the other more important possibility is that consumers are 
getting pinched right now he added prices were going up in 
general even before the oil crisis wages were not keeping up with 
prices so consumers were relying more and more on revolving 
credit 
nearly 75 percent of the july gain was in revolving or credit 
card debt it was up 217 percent at a annual rate or 377 
billion after rising 70 percent in june such debt had increased

secretary of state james a baker iii 
said monday he would go to syria to coordinate antiiraq efforts 
with president hafez assad despite major differences that include 
us listing of syria as a sponsor of international terrorism 
we share the same goals baker said referring to the us 
drive to isolate iraqi president saddam hussein with a strict 
economic boycott and to confront him with an international ground 
and sea force 
however the united states considers assad one of the more 
radical arab leaders in the middle east and baker acknowledged 
we continue to have some differences with syria and we expect to 
discuss those differences 
in a news conference at nato headquarters baker also reported 
that saudi arabia the united arab emirates and the overthrown 
government of kuwait would contribute 12 billion to help pay for 
the us defense of the persian gulf and to assist nations hurt 
financially by their adherence to the boycott of iraq authorized 
last month by the un security council 
barring unforeseen expenses the contributions would cover the 
estimated 6 billion the united states planned to spend in 
defending saudi oil fields this year 
baker said president bush had directed him to go to damascus to 
meet with assad thursday night after talks in moscow with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev and foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze 
the president felt it was an important time to have a 
facetoface dialogue baker said 
he then flew to moscow where he will pursue with the soviets a 
new approach to limiting nonnuclear troops tanks and artillery in 
europe 
the two superpowers had agreed in february in ottawa to limit 
us and soviet troops in central europe to 195000 an additional 
30000 us troops could be stationed elsewhere in western europe 
but the planned withdrawal of soviet troops from eastern europe 
has caused a reappraisal baker said the ottawa goals had been 
overtaken by events and no longer pertain 
besides considering lower levels which would mean a withdrawal 
of even more us troops baker will meet with shevardnadze and the 
foreign ministers of britain france west germany and east germny 
on the emerging unification of the two germanys 
syria in a makeshift alliance with the united states has sent 
troops to saudi arabia and to the united arab emirates to guard 
their oil fields against an iraqi attack 
over the years the state department has sharply condemned 
syrias domestic human rights record and accused it of sponsoring 
terrorism against american and israeli civilians 
syria is one of the seven countries on the departments 
terrorism list making it ineligible for us military equipment 
sophisticated technology and us assistance in acquiring 
international bank loans after an eightyear lapse iraq was put 
back on the list sept 1 
baker said he spoke by telephone with the ambassadors of saudi 
arabia and the united arab emirates monday morning and received 
word that they along with the overthrown kuwait monarchy will 
contribute a total of 12 billion to the economic and military 
campaign against iraqs saddam hussein 
while touring the persian gulf last week baker received 
commitments of aid without specific amounts from king fahd of 
saudi arabia and president zayid of the united arab emirates emir 
jabir al sabah of the displaced kuwaiti government offered 6 
billion 
baker said roughly half of the 12 billion would go to offset 
costs of american efforts in the gulf including us forces the 
other half would assist poorer nations observing the boycott of 
iraq 
after iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 the bush 
administration reached out to both syria and iran to join the 
campaign against saddam relying on their longstanding differences 
with baghdad 
assad and saddam head rival factions of the baathist party while 
iran fought an eightyear war with iraq 
as baker briefed nato foreign ministers on the summit bush and 
gorbachev held sunday in helsinki finland the iranian news agency 
reported iran has agreed to restore diplomatic relations with iraq 
a us official said baker had no plans to meet with iranian 
representatives while baker said he would not go to tehran 
the united states has not had good relations with syria 
baker said we would like to see an improvement in those 
relations 
pressed why he was going to damascus baker replied they are 
there 
he made no mention of iraqs reported diplomatic reconciliation 
with iran when asked if the united states would welcome iranian 
help baker said you bet we would 
the united states has no relations with iran while maintaining 
ties with syria 
as for nato participation in the antiiraq effort of the 16 
nations in the alliance only the united states turkey britain and 
france have troops in the persian gulf region 
others have contributed ships to move troops and eight 
countries are holding exercises in the mediterranean 
baker said he suggested they extend their operations eastward 
closer to the crisis area 
manfred woerner the nato secretarygeneral said there was a 
unanimous conviction more can and should be done by the allies to 
support the united states but woerner stressed it would be up to 
each nation to decide what to do

cambodias vietnamesebacked 
government and leaders of rebel factions agreed monday to a un 
peace plan that calls for powersharing and free elections 
cambodia premier hun sen said a date for a ceasefire had not 
been worked out but all sides appeared optimistic following two 
days of talks to end the 11yearold civil war 
we have not reached peace yet but we have the framework 
said son sann former cambodian premier and leader of the khmer 
peoples national liberation front part of the threeparty 
guerrilla force 
efforts to reach a peace accord since july 1988 had failed when 
the factions disagreed about powersharing issues under the 
approved un plan each of the four factions would be represented 
in a governing council 
a joint statement said hun sens government would get six seats 
on the socalled supreme national council six others seats would 
be shared by the resistance coalition a 13th seat is reserved for 
prince norodom sihanouk leader of the rebel coalition 
the council is expected to make its first formal appearance 
sept 18 at the un general assembly seat now held by the rebel 
coalition 
the council would cede much of its authority to the united 
nations which would administer the country until free elections 
un officials have said up to 10000 troops and 10000 civilian 
personnel could be sent to cambodia to administer the peace plan 
and oversee elections 
the plan which also calls for disarming the four armies was 
adopted last month by the five permanent members of the un 
security council the united states soviet union china britain 
and france 
we are very pleased with the document and we accept it 
without reservation said khieu samphan head of the communist 
khmer rouge which rejected the plan in june because each faction 
did not have an equal number of seats on the council 
if i can summarize it in one word success said edwige 
avice french deputy foreign minister who led the peace talk 
effort along with indonesian foreign minister ali alatas 
the rebel coalition includes the noncommunist forces of 
sihanouk and son sann who are backed by washington and the 
chinesebacked communist khmer rouge 
the rebels have been battling to oust the vietnamesebacked 
phnom penh government which seized power in late 1978 after its 
forces toppled the khmer rouge 
during nearly four years in power the khmer rouge tried to 
transform cambodia into a radical agrarian society resulting in 
the deaths of nearly 1 million people 
in a statement issued in beijing on monday sihanouk said he 
would take a sixmonth leave from politics because of ill health 
prince norodom ranariddh sihanouks son and leader of his faction 
in jakarta said his father suffered from kidney stones 
the five security council nations said they would welcome 
sihanouk as head of the council but the factions will be able to 
decide its makeup and the arrangements to transfer power to the un 
in a message from beijing on saturday sihanouk quoted chinese 
prime minister li peng as saying the time is ripe to solve the 
cambodian problem 
the peace talk process sped up after the united states withdrew 
diplomatic recognition of the rebel coalition because it included 
the khmer rouge

iran said monday it has agreed to restore 
full diplomatic relations with its former adversary iraq which is 
hoping to break out of its international isolation and coax support 
from other countries 
but it was not clear whether tehran by reopening embassies and 
exchanging diplomats with baghdad for the first time since the 
iraniraq war has agreed to allow iraq to ship in food and 
medicine through iran to bypass unimposed economic sanctions for 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
middle east analyst hansheino kopietz noted diplomatic 
relations between iran and iraq never officially were severed 
despite the two countries bloody 198088 war they closed their 
embassies in 1986 and their diplomats returned home but there was 
no formal declaration breaking relations 
the islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia reported 
the agreement was reached during talks in tehran between iranian 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati and his iraqi counterpart 
tariq aziz 
aziz returned to baghdad on monday after a 24hour visit to 
tehran the first by an iraqi official since the islamic 
revolutionary government seized power in iran in 1979 
quoting a reliable source irna said that aziz in his talks 
with ali akbar velayati called for the restoration of bilateral 
relations and reopening of embassies in the two countries 
officials of the islamic republic of iran gave a positive 
response to the iraqi foreign ministers call and announced their 
consent in this connection irna said 
there was no immediate comment from baghdad 
kopietz a former specialist with londons international 
institute for strategic studies who is now a consultant said it 
was too early to say if iran its relations with the west marred by 
a decadelong hostility would go as far as rescinding its 
commitment to the un embargo 
what it means is simply that they agreed to revive the 
diplomatic relations possibly at ambassadorial level to establish 
a direct channel of communication that would speed up a formal 
border demarcation kopietz said in a telephone interview 
irna said preparations for reactivating the diplomatic missions 
will begin in the near future but gave no other details 
aziz flew home monday after a meeting with iranian president 
hashemi rafsanjani which also was attended by velayati irna 
reported 
he had met alone with valayati for 2 hours immediately after 
his arrival sunday in iran 
irna quoted aziz as saying before his departure that his talks 
in tehran were positive serious practical and friendly 
it said aziz called for speeding up the the trend of 
improvement of ties between iran and iraq and an exchange of 
diplomatic delegations 
he said iran and iraq should join in confronting imperialist 
trends to sow discord among the people of the region adding that 
he has invited velayati to baghdad and hoped to see him there soon 
irna reported too that aziz explained baghdads position in the 
gulf to rafsanjani and velayati who reiterated iranian 
condemnation of the annexation of kuwait as well as the deployment 
of foreign forces in the region 
aziz had been expected to ask iraq to allow shipments of food 
and medicine across their 730mile border the tehran times an 
englishlanguage daily said to be close to rafsanjani hinted two 
days ago that iran might allow humanitarian shipments into its 
onetime archenemy 
iran has declared it will abide by the un sanctions but it 
has strongly condemned the us presence in the region and there 
was speculation that by hinting at aiding iraq was aimed at 
securing financial aid from the west 
there were unconfirmed reports from baghdad that the iranians 
already have allowed rice flour and wheat consignments across the 
northern border 
the aid in food and medicines that iran could provide could be 
of crucial important at this stage said a diplomat in tehran 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
under the sanctions iraqs vital oil exports have been blocked 
cutting off its main source of revenue 
the tehran times hinted that iran could decide to allow iraqi 
oil out through its pipelines to its big kharg island terminal in 
the northern gulf 
analyst charles snow commented in the respected middle east 
economic survey newsletter monday that such a move would be a 
massive and flagrant violation of sanctions and the question is 
what the iranians hope to gain by even suggesting such a scenario 
iraq has been desperately seeking that kind of support to help 
it circumvent the sanctions because its tiny coastline is 
effectively blocked by the usled multinational fleet in the gulf 
baghdads campaign to improve relations with tehran began 
shortly after imposition of the un sanctions when iraq found 
itself confrontating the west while its eastern border with iran 
remained highly vulnerable 
president saddam hussein agreed to withdraw his troops from 
iranian territory held since the 1988 ceasefire exchange all 
prisonersofwar and abide by a 1975 treaty splitting the vital 
shatt alarab waterway with iran 
the waterway just north of the kuwaiti border is iraqs key 
outlet to the gulf 
the withdrawal from iranian territory freed tens of thousands of 
soldiers for deployment in kuwait where saddams troops face more 
than 100000 us troops in saudi arabia

more than 500 pieces of evidence are 
being examined in the killings of five college students but 
investigators refused to say monday if they are closer to an arrest 
were not going to let time dictate this investigation said 
lt spencer mann spokesman for the alachua county sheriffs 
office we have to be right we cant guess we cant take 
chances 
only about half the evidence which authorities last week 
characterized as promising have been processed at the florida 
department of law enforcements jacksonville crime lab said steve 
platt who heads the lab 
the evidence was gathered from the three slaying scenes as well 
as during searches of suspect edward lewis humphreys gainesville 
apartment indialantic home and his car authorities said the 
evidence also includes bodily fluids and fingerprints taken from 
humphrey at the brevard county jail in sharpes 
he is being held in lieu of 11 million bond on unrelated 
assault charges 
its a slow painstaking effort platt said of the crime 
scene evidence we are faced with what can be likened to three 
very complex puzzles that we are trying to put together one piece 
at a time 
he said he could not give a timetable for completing the 
examination 
dna testing of blood and semen are in progress platt said 
although investigators refused to say whether that evidence was 
obtained from the scene or from humphrey 
police refused to comment on published reports that a pubic hair 
resembling humphreys was found at one of the slaying scenes or 
that he had told investigators where to find a knife hidden in a 
milk carton 
investigators have described the killer as shrewd and 
methodical they have said he left taunting messages to them 
and arranged body parts at the slaying scene for maximum shock 
value 
humphrey is one of eight slaying suspects police said the only 
other publicly identified is stephen michael bates 30 a lakeland 
shortorder cook also jailed on an unrelated assault charge 
humphrey faces one count of assaulting his grandmother and is 
charged with the october 1988 armed burglary and attempted rape of 
an indian river county woman and an aug 25 assault on two male 
university of florida students 
meanwhile life around this college town appeared to carry on 
normally with landlords making plans to rent the apartments where 
students were slain investigators finished their searches of the 
apartments over the weekend 
theres still blood on the walls said carol hyde manager 
of the gatorwood apartments where the bodies of manny taboada and 
tracy paules both 23 were found aug 28

saddam hussein offered free oil to developing nations monday in 
a bid to win their support and circumvent a un trade embargo and 
he got a boost from a former enemy when iran agreed to restore full 
diplomatic ties 
the white house characterized both developments as signs the 
iraqi president is growing desperate and grasping at any straw he 
can find 
secretary of state james a baker iii briefing nato ministers 
on the weekend ussoviet summit asked the allies to send ground 
troops into the persian gulf region even as a symbolic presence 
to increase pressure on iraq to withdraw from kuwait there were no 
immediate offers 
baker also announced he would visit syria to coordinate 
opposition to iraq with president hafez assad the united states 
and syria have longstanding differences over human rights and 
terrorism but have formed a makeshift alliance during the gulf 
crisis 
syria beefed up its contribution to the multinational force 
facing iraq saying it was sending more troops to saudi arabia at 
the desert kingdoms request diplomatic sources estimate that 
syria has already sent 45000 combat troops to the kingdom 
in other developments monday 
baker told reporters saudi arabia the united arab emirates and 
the exiled government of kuwait would contribute a combined 12 
billion to help defray the cost of the us buildup in the gulf and 
to assist poorer nations hurt by the un trade embargo on iraqi 
goods 
the official iraqi news agency criticized president bushs 
motives in meeting with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in 
helsinki finland it said the summit showed bushs evil 
tendencies and his spite for the arab nation 
after seven hours of talks sunday the two leaders reiterated 
their demand that iraq withdraw immediately and unconditionally 
from kuwait they did not rule out the use of force if a peaceful 
solution is not found 
there were reports saddam has executed members of his elite 
presidential guard who allegedly were planning to assasinate him 
two egyptian state newspapers quoting western diplomats said five 
officers were ordered executed kuwait radio run by the emirates 
governmentinexile reported sunday that three members of the 
guard already had been killed it gave no details 
kuwaits ambassador to the united nations said iraqi occupation 
forces have intensified their crackdown on kuwaitis killing 
civilians in the streets and rounding up others in mass arrests 
in his latest televised message saddam addressed third world 
countries but did not name them he said he was making his offer as 
a gesture of solidarity regardless of the various governments 
stands in the persian gulf crisis 
we hereby declare that we are prepared to supply all third 
world countries with oil free of charge in accordance with the 
needs of each country saddam said 
we are brothers to you we share the same destiny he told 
the developing nations in what appeared a clear attempt to gain 
their support in his faceoff against the west 
the offer is in appreciation for your evenhanded policies 
toward arab causes the foremost of which is the palestinian 
cause saddam said 
his statement was read by a broadcaster on iraqi state radio and 
tv and monitored and translated in nicosia cyprus by the 
associated press 
saddam said iraq could not transport the oil because of the un 
embargo so interested countries would have to arrange transport 
themselves that would require tankers to dock in iraq and load the 
oil in violation of the embargo 
saddam claimed his offer would not violate the un sanctions 
because no buying or selling would be involved the embargo was 
imposed shortly after iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater disagreed with saddams 
claim picking up free oil would not violate the embargo the 
sanctions clearly cover the oil at any cost he said in a 
written statement 
the united nations has approved the use of force to enforce the 
antiiraqi sanctions 
scores of developing nations have suffered as a result of the 
prohibition on trade with iraq among those hit hard have been 
nepal sri lanka the philippines bangladesh zambia and zimbabwe 
in tehran the official islamic republic news agency reported 
that iran and iraq had agreed to restore full diplomatic ties and 
open embassies in the two countries 
it said the agreement was reached in a meeting between iranian 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati and his iraqi counterpart 
tariq aziz 
aziz left tehran monday after a 24hour visit in which he sought 
iranian help in beating the un trade sanctions it was not clear 
whether tehran had agreed to allow iraq to receive food and 
medicine through iran but there were unconfirmed reports that 
shipments of rice and flour already were being sent to iraq via 
iran 
irans leaders have said they will honor the embargo although 
they object to the us military buildup in saudi arabia 
irna quoting what it called a reliable source said that 
aziz in his talks with ali akbar velayati called for the 
restoration of bilateral relations and reopening of embassies in 
the two countries 
officials of the islamic republic of iran gave a positive 
response to the iraqi foreign ministers call and announced their 
consent irna said in an englishlanguage dispatch 
it quoted the source as saying the exchange of diplomatic 
missions will begin in the near future but gave no other 
details 
diplomatic relations between iran and iraq were never officially 
severed even though the two countries were at war from 1980 to 
1988 they closed their embassies in 1986 and their diplomats 
returned home 
azizs visit to iran was the first by an iraqi official since 
the islamic revolution in 1979 a year later the persian gulf war 
broke out an august 1988 ceasefire halted fighting 
baghdad began its campaign to improve relations with tehran 
shortly after the un sanctions were ordered it withdrew its 
troops from iranian territory it had held since the ceasefire 
began prisoner exchanges and agreed to abide by a 1975 treaty 
splitting the shatt alarab waterway with iran previously iraq 
had demanded full control of the waterway 
in washington presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said that 
both iraqs overtures to iran and its offer of free oil were 
desperation attempts 
such maneuvers have not worked in the past and will not work 
this time fitzwater said

consumer activist ralph nader objected 
strongly monday to a forbes magazine cover story depicting him as 
overseer of a vast network of organizations financed in part by 
rich lawyers and other special interest groups 
it is really reckless stuff nader said in a telephone 
interview if they dont retract i will take them to court 
forbes editor james w michael said the article was carefully 
researched and checked and we stand by it 
the sept 17 edition of the business biweekly said the 
56yearold nader controlled to varying degrees 29 organizations 
with combined revenues of 75 million to 80 million 
it said nader had an umbilical connection with rich 
plaintiff attorneys who make huge sums in naderbacked suits 
against industry and in return contribute to his consumer 
organizations 
the article titled st ralph and his web of interests and 
written by peter brimelow and leslie spencer said nader has 
consistently opposed changes in the damagesuit system 
it also said nader has shown little interest in health problems 
related to smoking because of donations from tobacco fortunes and 
has said little about the cost to consumers of protectionism 
because of his ties to organized labor 
forbes also said naders claims that he leads an austere life 
were a myth it said he rides in limousines and stays in the best 
hotels when traveling earns up to 1 million a year in speaking 
fees and lives in a luxurious town house in washington dc 
in reaction nader said he earns about 300000 annually for 
speaking engagements and donates all but 15000 to various 
research groups and charities he said the town house forbes refers 
to belongs to his sister 
this is a really sleazy invasion of privacy he said 
nader said he will go to court if forbes does not retract 
statements that his center for study of responsive law has not 
filed disclosure forms obligatory for nonprofit organizations 
since its 1968 founding 
he said the reason the internal revenue service reported no 
documents from the center was that forbes gave the irs the wrong 
name putting the in front of the title 
nader said he will also demand that forbes retract statements 
that he owns citizens television systems inc which he said is a 
nonprofit corporation he said he found more than two dozen other 
mistakes in the article which he will take up in a rebuttal he 
will ask forbes to publish 
nader said his organizations had received less than 1 percent of 
their funds from the legal profession over the past 30 years 
he said forbes had attacked him because the business magazine 
is ideologically affiliated with the corporations were 
fighting particularly big insurance companies hit by naders 
consumer campaigns 
forbes editor michaels said nader was obviously very 
thinskinned 
he said the main purpose of the article was to show naders deep 
connections with trial lawyers mr nader has successfully 
fostered the view that he stands above special interests and in 
fact we have established that he doesnt stand above special 
interests at all

when master sgt samuel kanyon doe 
seized power his people hailed him as a hero redeeming them from 
serfdom imposed by descendants of freed american slaves who founded 
liberia 
he clung to power for 10 years the way he gained it with brutal 
killings of challengers that shocked the world and left many 
liberians ashamed to admit their nationality 
he and his bank accounts have grown fat literally on the 
blood and flesh of our people said a liberian university 
professor 
president doe 38 refused repeated demands that he resign and 
leave the country and us state department said he had died of 
wounds suffered in a gun and grenade battle with rebels of a small 
faction led by prince johnson who used to fight in does army 
the rebels quarreled with doe when he turned up unexpectedly at 
the headquarters of a west african regional force sunday in 
monrovias port the regional troops came to liberia in the hopes 
of restoring peace rebels claimed doe had finally decided to flee 
the country wracked by war since dec 24 
more than 60 people most of them does bodyguards died in the 
fighting that left doe wounded in both legs he reportedly died 
sunday in a rebel camp where johnson was interrogating him about 
millions of dollars that disappeared from state coffers 
witnesses said does mutilated body was put on display 
according to the british broadcasting corp 
doe started his political career as a semiliterate career 
soldier who sneered at education he became a portly dictatorial 
despot proud of the masters degree in political science he was 
awarded by the university of liberia 
they got all their phds in their books i got a phd in m16 
guns he once said books is a liberian pidgeon word for 
education 
but does arrogance masked what sometimes seemed to be an 
inferiority complex when he was forced by mounting opposition to 
announce he would not stand for reelection next year doe said he 
wanted to devote time to his family and get a doctorate 
in his private life he was said to be fond of football and 
adopted the style of an african potentate having six children from 
his two wives and at least five from his mistresses his senior 
wife left him after the coup 
doe once declared he wanted someone else to carry the burden of 
leading the nation to end political harassment that included 
about 36 coup attempts his detractors say many were conjured up as 
excuses to kill opponents 
the most serious of the coup attempts in 1985 was led by does 
former army chief of staff gen thomas quiwonkpa he had returned 
from exile in the united states to try to oust doe after blatantly 
rigged elections 
quiwonkpa got to the gates of does israelibuilt fortified 
mansion before his troops were stopped 
doe boasted he disemboweled quiwonkpa his friend from 
childhood what was left of the general was paraded down monrovias 
tubman boulevard on the back of a jeep by soldiers who stripped 
flesh from the body and ate it publicly 
i saw it hundreds of liberians saw it the stories of 
cannibalism at the mansion are not fairy tales said a liberian 
clerk 
an orgy of killings followed as doe repressed a rebellion he 
sent troops to quiwonkpas home county of nimba they murdered 
thousands of civilians from the gio and mano tribes to which the 
coup plotters belonged 
five years later the gio and mano took their revenge rallying 
to the call of rebel leader charles taylor his rebel army invaded 
from neighboring ivory coast last december and doe sent troops who 
again killed hundreds of civilians 
he has doomed us with a legacy of tribal hatred that may never 
end as each side seeks to avenge the killings of the others 
said a lawyer 
doe is a krahn a tribe making up 2 percent of liberias 23 
million people krahns are despised by most of the other 13 ethnic 
groups 
as for does foreign policy many liberians said it was dictated 
by greed 
liberia became the first african country after egypt to resume 
diplomatic relations with israel after the camp david agreement 
doe then visited israel and returned with commitments for 
cooperation including training of his feared special 
antiterrorist unit many personal favors were included critics 
claim 
at the same time his government is accused of extorting 
hundreds of thousands of dollars from lebanese businessmen who 
smuggle diamonds from liberia depriving the nation of desperately 
needed revenue 
libya was the first country to recognize doe after his coup 
other african leaders shunned the master sergeant and denounced the 
assassination of 68yearold president william tolbert in his bed 
and the killings of 16 tolbert aides the aides were given a 
kangaroo trial fastened to stakes on monrovias atlantic beach 
and shot by a drunken firing squad 
doe had said at one point that he had no regrets though he had 
to make some difficult decisions 
it is especially difficult when it comes to signing death 
warrants he said in 1985 in my lonely moments at night i 
said to myself why should these people be executed

prince yealu johnson the dissident 
rebel leader whose forces are said to have killed liberias 
president has fought on two fronts to overthrow the government 
and to overshadow a rival insurgent 
johnson 31 was one of the original group that invaded liberia 
from the ivory coast on dec 24 rebel sources and friends say 
johnson took command when the first commander paul harris was 
killed in an early firefight with government troops 
rebel leader charles taylor later eclipsed johnson cultivating 
foreign journalists and some friendly african governments the 
sources said 
johnson finally broke with taylor this year perhaps over the 
issue of who would lead the movement since then the two groups 
have been at odds 
taylor has accused johnsons forces of killing an elite combat 
unit of taylors men if we find him we will kill him he 
assassinated seven of our special forces taylor reportedly said 
taylor has been accused by some rebel supporters of having 
rivals executed 
johnson whose forces have been described by us officials as 
more disciplined than taylors and perhaps stronger is entirely of 
african descent taylor is of mixed americoliberian african 
ancestry americoliberians are the descendants of american slaves 
who founded liberia in 1847 
it was johnsons forces who moved into monrovia the capital in 
early august and took control of the port taylors men remained 
stalled on the outskirts after seizing most of liberia 
son of a hunter from the gio tribe johnson was born in 
yorcomplay in eastern nimba county rebels launched their attack by 
invading nimba from the ivory coast last year 
johnson grew up with an uncle in monrovia where he was 
befriended by an american family attached to the us agency for 
international development they helped him finish high school 
he joined the army in 1981 and quickly became a lieutenant 
assigned to intelligence he also received some military training 
from us advisers 
he was arrested during an unsuccessful 1985 coup led by gen 
thomas quiwonkpa but escaped and rejoined other exiles in ivory 
coast 
there has been speculation in some regional magazines that the 
united states prefers johnson to taylor the us state department 
says libya supports taylor

the senate approved a resolution monday 
threatening a deterioration in us relations with nations that 
dont contribute enough to the effort against saddam hussein japan 
and west germany were among countries singled out by irate senators 
the resolution attached to a spending bill for the postal 
service treasury department and other government agencies 
directed president bush to present congress a detailed report on 
the administrations costsharing efforts by nov 30 
during his consultations with other international leaders 
bush should consider stressing that failure by any country to 
actively contribute in the most appropriate manner for that country 
could have a detrimental impact on its bilateral relationship with 
the united states the resolution said 
passed by voice vote in the first such congressional action 
since bush ordered us troops to saudi arabia the resolution 
reflected lawmakers sensitivity to complaints from voters that the 
united states is shouldering too much of the burden in the war of 
nerves with iraq 
with 100000 us servicemen and women now deployed in the 
persian gulf the defense department estimates that its desert 
shield operation to deter further iraqi aggression will cost about 
113 billion over the next year 
the european community voted last week to contribute 2 billion 
of economic aid to egypt turkey and other countries who have 
contributed troops to the buildup 
saudi arabia the united arab emirates and the exiled government 
of kuwait have pledged 12 billion to help pay for the us 
military buildup and to assist poor nations hurt by adherence to 
the trade embargo against iraq 
however japan which gets about half of its oil from the 
persian gulf region so far has pledged only 1 billion despite 
pleas from treasury secretary nicholas s brady for more 
if combat arises it will not be japanese boys whose lives are 
at risk it will be american boys said sen john mccain rariz 
the contemptible tokenism of the actions of the japanese 
government to date merit nothing but the worlds contempt and 
american hostility 
sen dennis deconcini dariz the primary author of the 
resolution said the united states with a 170 billion budget 
deficit cannot play uncle sugar to the world 
this time the burden must be shared he said germany can 
send more ships to the mediterranean to offset the many us naval 
vessels now in the red sea the persian gulf and the gulf of oman 
south korea which imports 25 percent of its oil from the persian 
gulf can send some troops 
both germany and japan contend that their constitutions adopted 
after losing world war ii forbid them from sending troops to the 
persian gulf 
deconcini also singled out japans delay of a week in sending 
800 fourwheeldrive vehicles for use in the saudi desert because 
its merchant marine balked at sending a ship into the region 
there does not seem to be this same hesitation however when 
fourwheeldrive vehicles are sent to us ports in this country 
he said 
also as part of the bill the senate approved by voice vote an 
amendment by sen jesse helms rnc that would allow troops in 
the desert shield operation to mail letters home at no charge 
helms who was among the lawmakers who visited with troops in 
the region over the past two weeks said a repeated complaint was 
being unable to find stamps 
no one needs to be told that mail is the crucial link between 
the fighting man or woman and his family and friends back home 
he said they did not have stamps they could not get stamps and 
if by some chance stamps came their way they were soon stuck 
together by the humidity and the sweat 
a similar free mailing provision was introduced monday in the 
house by rep william ford dmich chairman of the house post 
office and civil service committee

dismaying radical reformers president mikhail s 
gorbachev and prime minister nikolai ryzhkov have agreed on a 
compromise economic reform plan that tries to unite two 
contradictory proposals officials said monday 
russian federation president boris yeltsin has likened any such 
attempt to combine the radical reform that he favors with ryzhkovs 
conservative economic plan to mating a hedgehog and a snake 
one radical legislator called for a vote of no confidence in 
ryzhkovs government 
radicals at the session of the supreme soviet that opened monday 
had been expecting gorbachev himself to present the sweeping 
economic reform plan devised by his adviser stanislav shatalin 
but shatalin was left shaking his finger with fury in the 
parliaments lobby as he told gorbachev confidante alexander 
yakovlev the compromise was impossible 
ryzhkov said monday evening he would explain the compromise to 
the supreme soviet national legislature on tuesday gorbachev backs 
the plan parliamentary chairman anatoly lukyanov told the tass 
news agency 
a joint economic task force set up by yeltsin and gorbachev 
favors a plan to fundamentally change the structure of the country 
it would transfer enormous authority from the national parliament 
to the legislatures of the 15 soviet republics according to a 
draft obtained by the associated press 
the republics then would have the power to pursue their own 
reforms including a rapid transfer to a market economy and 
legalization of private land ownership 
but ryzhkovs government refuses to accept what it considers a 
rebellion by the republics tass said 
ryzhkovs original plan which the supreme soviet last spring 
returned to him to be reworked called for continued central 
planning with a slow transition to a partial market economy it 
also urged doubling and tripling many statecontrolled prices 
which set off a wave of panicbuying 
at mondays supreme soviet session leningrad mayor and 
parliament member anatoly sobchak one of the leading radicals 
urged a noconfidence vote in ryzhkov for his failure to produce a 
viable reform program 
we dont have the right to keep preserving the power of the 
government that showed its inability to lead the country out of a 
crisis sobchak said 
there was no immediate decision on whether to take a 
noconfidence vote radicals have tried this twice in the past 
year it went to a vote once in december and ryzhkov won easily 
ryzhkov is going to try to unite the different concepts of 
central planning and a market economy said legislator alexei 
yablokov i am convinced that it is impossible 
ryzhkov and his staff believe a swift transition to a market 
economy would be like an overdose for an exhausted patient 
tass said 
opponents of a rapid economic transition say it would lead to 
popular discontent by causing widespread unemployment and steep 
price rises 
shatalins plan calls for gorbachevs central government to 
accept two controversial claims by the republics control of their 
own natural resources and the supremacy of their laws over 
national ones 
although billed as an economic reform plan it amounts to a new 
political structure for the nation if signed by gorbachev and the 
republics it would amount to an agreement on the principles of a 
new union treaty the basic unifying document of the soviet union 
but gorbachevs refusal to accept the entire shatalin plan puts 
his national government once again on a collision course with the 
government of the russian republic headed by yeltsin the russian 
parliament is expected to approve the shatalin plan possibly this 
week 
shatalin told reporters monday he believed gorbachev generally 
supported his radical proposal and he was surprised to hear 
ryzhkov would offer a compromise he said he expected to meet with 
gorbachev later monday to discuss the situation 
shatalin said the ryzhkov plan contradicted his own and the two 
could not be merged 
tass said the parliamentary session amounted to the end of the 
preparatory stage of perestroika which resulted in the 
disintegration of the old political and economic system 
shatalins plan calls for creation of an economic union of the 
15 republics of the soviet union with each republic controlling 
its own finances and natural resources and each entitled to a 
share of the national gold and hard currency reserves according to 
an early draft 
the national government would retain control of defense 
economic forecasting money supply customs and environmental 
protection it would run national scientific research and space 
programs atomic energy railroads and communications it would 
control only those prices the republics allowed it to regulate 
the national government would have no power to tax instead 
republics would pay dues based on their share of national income 
the draft said 
under the existing central planning system moscow bureaucrats 
now set prices and divvy up factory production among many 
customers throwing the market into disarray with factories short 
of supplies

look at this think how frightened she must 
have been rita lowe exclaimed trying to imagine her italian 
immigrant mothers awe on entering the cavernous registry room on 
ellis island in 1907 
can you imagine coming from a small village she commented 
mrs lowe 67 of long beach calif was among the 371 people 
who took the first ferry from battery park on lower manhattan 
across the harbor monday for the first day that the portal to the 
new world was reopened to the public as a museum celebrating 
american immigrants 
we came to be sure we were here this first day said mrs 
lowe who walked the halls of the restored building with relatives 
remembering her mothers tales 
coming from a small town women were modest and the physical 
embarrassed her i can understand but she couldnt she often spoke 
of those first days here and would say to me i was healthy not 
sick why did they have to examine me that way 
we have to keep this place alive mrs lowe said in 
memory of her and for all those reasons why she came here her and 
all the others 
laima silaikis hood 50 of new york came to the united states 
from lithuania in 1949 she didnt enter through ellis island but 
an uncle of hers had in 1910 
the significance for me being an immigrant a refugee is 
that i can identify with those who came before she said 
standing before photo murals and a display of centuryold 
immigrants trunks valises and baskets in the baggage room a 
great hall at the front entrance of the museum 
the building contains a variety of exhibits on three levels 
many depicting what the incoming millions and their adopted country 
were like when they got here 
patricia sandler was enthralled with the display of immigrant 
artifacts and said she wished she had thought to contribute an 
heirloom from her grandparents john and maria desimone they 
passed through ellis island from naples italy in 1907 
they had lived near mount vesuvius and when it erupted they 
had copper pots they put over their heads to protect them from 
falling stones 
weve had those pots all these years things they kept in 
steamer trunks as mementos mrs sandler said 
theodore heretakis 55 went straight from the ferry to the 
islands seawall to scan the wall of honor among the 200000 names 
inscribed in copper he found the name of his father stavros and 
his fatherinlaw pantelis gigourtakis who came from crete in the 
1920s 
i marvel at the achievement of all the immigrants said 
heretakis an engineer who lives in commack they all demonstrate 
what our parents had the hard work and aspiration 
jerry khlumsky 48 of new york said his grandfather joseph 
settled in chicago in the 1890s after arriving in new york from 
prague in what is now czechoslovakia 
i feel very close and yet theres a gap khlumsky said i 
feel a kinship with eastern europe and this is sort of a meeting 
place between here and there 
i cant believe people had the guts to leave and come where 
they had no idea what they were coming to said jennifer 
wechsler 18 of los angeles who took in the museum with her 
mother judy on the last day of a visit in the city 
barbara viborka 54 of new york reminiscing at the seawall 
said her parents came from czechoslovakia arriving in separate 
ships 
growing up i heard about the trip all the time she said 
they never told me about the bad they made a joke of it 
mother was just coming for a visit to see a cousin and go back 
home she was 16 but she was seasick 14 days and she said she 
decided when she got here god put me on land and thats where im 
staying

fourteen historically black colleges and 
universities are affiliating in pairs with seven midwestern 
research universities to improve the research capabilities of the 
black institutions the education department said monday 
the new coalition known as the university consortium for 
research and development was unveiled at a conference where energy 
secretary james d watkins announced an academic partnership 
between his department and a hazardous materials and waste 
management consortium formed by the historically black colleges 
the midwest consortium will try to win more research grants and 
contracts from private sources and federal agencies particularly 
the defense department the energy departments partnership will 
seek to increase the production of specialists in waste management 
officials said 
the nation has 107 colleges and universities that traditionally 
have attracted black students sometimes in the past being reserved 
for them by law when blacks were excluded from white institutions 
today those institutions serve more than 228000 students the 
education department said the institutions have provided 
undergraduate education for threefourths of all blacks holding a 
doctorate degree threefourths of all black officers in the armed 
forces and fourfifths of all black federal judges 
xavier university president norman francis added too often 
our youngsters have not had the opportunity in undergraduate school 
to do research and we are very concerned about increasing the 
number of our graduates in graduate school so they will become the 
researchers of the future as well as the faculty members of the 
future 
edward fort chancellor at north carolina aampt state university 
noted that of the 30 top producing research institutions during the 
198889 school year none was a historically black instituion 
he said it is imperative that greater resources be channeled to 
historically black institutions because of statistics that show 
members of minority groups constituting 35 percent of the us 
population by the year 2020 
there have been some predictions the nation will be short 
700000 science and technology professionals by the year 2000 
the seven midwest universities and their affiliates in the new 
grouping are 
indiana university and xavier and texas southern universities 
iowa state university and tuskegee and clark atlanta 
universities 
the university of minnesota and florida aampm and jackson state 
universities 
the university of missouri and university of arkansas at pine 
bluff and delaware state college 
ohio state university and hampton and north carolina aampt 
universities 
purdue university and prairie view aampm and tennessee state 
universities 
the university of wisconsin with alabama aampm and howard 
universities 
watkins said his departments effort will receive 43 million 
to develop curriculum train students and faculty and recruit 
students 
i strongly believe that waste management will be one of the 
fastest growing areas of career opportunity during this decade 
watkins said and not just at the phd level or even 
baccalaureate level we need technicians from our twoyear 
colleges and we need them badly 
the departments partners are alabama aampm clark atlanta 
florida aampm hampton howard jackson state north carolina aampt 
xavier tuskegee and prairie view aampm and the universities of new 
mexico highlands northern arizona southern at baton rouge texas

turkey for thanksgiving 
with all of that assembled talent guess which one was 
pictured standing next to the president on the national news that 
night the national turkey bush recalled to laughter weve 
done a little better on the scheduling this year helsinki

a prominent russian orthodox priest and writer who 
had once been persecuted by authorities was killed with an ax while 
on his way to church tass reported monday

ardent opponent of antisemitism it also said he was a dissident 
in the years of stagnation a reference to the administration of 
former soviet leader leonid i brezhnev who ruled from 196482 
but michael rowe a spokesman for keston college in britain 
which studies religion in communist countries said menn kept a low

themselves to the church rowe said in a strictly orthodox 
sense he was an evangelical

us sen alfonse damato criticized japan 
on monday as greedy for not sending more aid to the persian 
gulf to help multinational forces aligned against iraq 
they are acting totally within the character that they usually 
do damato a new york republican said of the japanese they 
are motivated by profit greed and avarice for them not to step 
forward and make a substantial financial contribution to this 
mission is unconscionable 
theirs is an attitude that i think really is repugnant 
damato said of the japanese 
damato said he thought the japanese could find a way to swing 
a deal to make some money to keep people from starving or from 
thirst 
officials at the japanese consulate in washington said their 
country has pledged 1 billion in aid mostly through transporting 
equipment to saudi arabia they also said japan stands ready with 
further economic help to egypt jordan and turkey 
instead of criticizing other countries it is more important 
to strengthen our cooperation and japan is prepared to cooperate 
further with the united states said spokesman noriyuki shikata 
japans constitution restricts the militarys role to self 
defense 
damato also criticized west germany for not offering more 
economic help and egypt for not sending more troops 
at times we have had more congressmen in the sands of the 
desert visiting than some of our allies have troops damato 
said we shouldnt be the lone ranger

congressional negotiators agreed monday to 
toughen industrial air pollution controls in smoggy areas bringing 
many small businesses under control requirements for the first time 
the agreement raised hopes that differences between house and 
senate versions of the complex clean air bill could be resolved in 
the current session thus giving the nation the first major 
revision of federal air pollution laws in 13 years 
the sources who spoke on condition that they not be identified 
said that staff negotiators agreed to accept the tough house 
provisions that would require even small polluters to install new 
control equipment 
the agreement which was expected to be approved by the house 
and senate members of the conference committee represented the 
most significant progress in working out a final clean air bill 
since the discussions began in june environmentalists said 
this is one of the major hurdles said daniel weiss who has 
followed the clean air debates for the sierra club 
different version of the legislation both of which impose 
farreaching pollution control requirements on automakers industry 
and electric utilities were approved by the house and senate early 
this year progress in resolving differences has been slow 
the bush administration had opposed the stronger house 
provisions agreed to in the accord monday saying that requirements 
on small companies to install smogreducing control devices would 
make the legislation too expensive 
the senate bill would have required new controls on smogforming 
chemicals from industrial installations releasing more than 100 
tons a year of those chemicals in smoggy areas 
the house bill would lower the cutoff to 50 tons or 25 tons a 
year depending upon the severity of the local smog problem and 
to 10 tons a year in greater los angeles 
that could bring some dry cleaning plants bakeries and auto 
paint shops under the control requirements 
the clean air bill even with the senates industrial smog 
provisions has been estimated to cost 25 billion a year when all 
its requirements go into effect toward the end of the decade 
industry lobbyists have argued in recent weeks that tough new 
pollution controls should not be imposed by the government at a 
time when the middle east crisis is causing oil prices to skyrocket 
and the economy is on the verge of a recession 
congressional sources who have been close to the clean air talks 
acknowledged that several controversial parts of the bill have yet 
to be tackled including whether to provide financial assistance to 
workers who lose their jobs because of tougher pollution controls 
some lawmakers have also suggested that parts of the bill should 
be reexamined in light of the mideast crisis 
we may have to begin to reassess what is realistic said 
rep mike synar dokla he suggested monday that some pollution 
control requirements on the petroleum industry and a mandate for 
cleaner fuels might have to be postponed 
the compromise accepted by the staff negotiators monday 
generally accepted all the house provisions in the sections of the 
bill dealing with industrial sources of smog and failure by cities 
to meet federal clean air standards 
the compromise included a house provision that the federal 
government may continue to impose air pollution control plans on 
cities that do not have satisfactory plans the senate version 
would have ended that authority

thirtytwo railroads received no federal 
inspections last year the general accounting office said monday in 
a report criticizing the transportation departments safety 
regulation 
the gao report prepared at the request of the heads of house 
and senate commerce committees said the federal railroad 
administration a part of the transportation department has not 
established inspection coverage standards for the various types of 
inspections 
the agency generally agreed with gaos findings the report 
said noting that officials had agreed to create a new position of 
director of training and communication 
the agency has safety responsibility for the nations 
approximately 500 railroads the report released monday said that 
32 had no inspections whatsoever in 1989 only operating practices 
not track and equipment was inspected at 168 others 
because there are no uniform monitoring standards the 
congressional investigative agency said federal rail inspectors 
do not have guidance on how often railroads equipment track 
signals or operating practices need to be inspected 
the gao said that the uninspected railroads typically were the 
smaller shortline railroads which have higher accident and injury 
rates than overall industry averages 
reacting to the report rep john dingell dmich chairman of 
the house energy and commerce committee said that for the third 
time in the last 15 months the gao has demonstrated that the 
federal railroad administrations past claims of an effective rail 
safety program are suspect or hollow

in yamoussoukro houphouetboignys hometown tight security was 
in place to prevent antigovernment demonstrations by recently 
legalized opposition parties during the papal visit 
houphouetboigny who has ruled the country as a oneparty state 
since independence from france in 1960 offered the basilica as a 
gift to the pope during a private audience last year at the vatican 
cost estimates range from 140 million to 300 million for the 
basilica which was packed to capacity for the consecration mass 
in the plaza outside tens of thousands of pilgrims followed the 
service on television monitors and loudspeakers 
organizers had indicated they expected up to 350000 people but 
some may have been discouraged by the armed soldiers stationed in 
and around the city 
there were no major incidents but police clubbed some people in 
the crush of worshipers pushing out of the basilica after the pope 
left news photographers said 
the cost of the basilica which was completed last year has 
been a source of controversy in this onceprosperous west african 
nation now suffering its worst economic crisis in 30 years of 
independence 
at the start of the consecration mass a senior vatican official 
delivered a strong defense of the basilica 
africa rejoices to have such a place to worship god said 
cardinal francis arinze a nigerian who heads the vatican office on 
interreligous dialogue 
in his homily the polishborn pope too appeared to defend the 
right of africans to their own basilica during all ages and on 
all continents the sons of the church have dedicated the best of 
their art to their faith he said 
the colossal church rising out of a former cocoa plantation 
owned by the president in this town of 70000 bears a striking 
resemblance to st peters in rome with its imposing dome and long 
arms of marble columns surrounding a plaza 
the basilica set on a 320acre site is 525 feet high at its 
tip compared with 452 feet at the top of the cross on the dome of 
st peters the basilica has 15000 panels of handblown french 
stained glass 
the basilica seats 7000 people and another 11000 standing the 
entire grounds can accommodate more than 350000 worshipers 
its architect pierre fakhoury has described the new basilica 
as the biggest church in christendom vatican officials however 
said they believed st peters is larger 
houphouetboigny says the basilica cost 140 million was built 
on his own land and was paid for with his familys money 
but published reports have said the price tag could be as high 
as 300 million and the presidents opponents accused him of 
misappropriating state money for the project 
whatever the cost critics have said the money would have been 
better spent on education and health care for the poor 
the vatican issued a written statement that appeared aimed at 
deflecting the criticism and underlining the social benefits of the 
church at the popes request a hospital and other assistance 
projects will be built on the grounds 
the statement said houphouetboigny had made available money for 
the maintenance of the complex which will also include a radio 
station and university offices 
the site will be managed by the our lady of peace international 
foundation under vatican control 
in accepting the donation and in establishing the our lady of 
peace foundation the holy father wishes to contribute to the good 
of ivorians and other africans the vatican statement said 
during the mass the pope sat on a thronelike chair under a 
brocaded canopy rising nine stories above the altar 
houphouetboigny who converted to catholicism in his youth 
hopes the basilica will become a pilgrimage center for africas 75 
million faithful about 10 percent of ivory coasts 10 million 
residents are catholics with onefourth moslems and most of the 
rest animists 
the popes seventh trip to africa also included stops in 
tanzania burundi and rwanda

the militarybacked caretaker 
government monday charged ousted prime minister benazir bhutto with 
corruption escalating its campaign against her in the weeks 
leading up to national elections 
ms bhutto called the charges an act of desperation and 
declared we will not take this lying down she said the 
government was trying to disqualify her and her party from the oct 
24 elections 
she was charged before a special onejudge court set up in 
karachi to try cases of official graft and possibly bar candidates 
from the voting 
judge wajihuddin ahmed will decide this week whether to accept 
the charges and serve formal notice to ms bhutto she has 
previously said she will not appear if she refuses legal experts 
say she could be arrested 
in addition the caretaker government said it plans to file 
criminal charges against her 
ms bhutto on monday went to file her nomination papers as a 
candidate representing lyari the sprawling slum in central karachi 
that is home to 1 million people but after hearing of the charges 
she postponed filing until tuesday 
ms bhutto won the lyari seat in parliament in the november 1988 
election that installed her as the first woman to lead a modern 
moslem nation 
later monday she told a crowded news conference at her home on 
the arabian sea that the caretaker government and the man who 
ousted her president ghulam ishaq khan were trying to disqualify 
her and her pakistan peoples party from the elections 
we want to take part in the election and we wont give in 
she said we will not take this lying down and we wont leave 
the field 
she said the peoples party had formed an alliance with three 
smaller centrist parties to fight the election under the banner of 
the peoples democratic alliance 
we might not have been the perfect government and we might 
have made mistakes she said but compared with the caretaker 
government and the previous government we were much more honest 
and competent 
according to the charges the 37yearold former prime minister 
abused her power by appointing a consulting firm to oversee a power 
project financed by the asian development bank she is also charged 
with awarding a lucrative contract to a british company to export 
cotton at prices substantially below the international market rate 
no other details were given 
if convicted she could be barred not only from next months 
election but from politics for seven years 
ms bhuttos lawyer former interior minister aitzaz ahsan said 
the charges were a political vendetta and would be challenged 
in court 
ishaq khan is frightened of her popular support and fearful of 
victory he is desperately seeking to disqualify her to prevent her 
return 
ishaq khan dismissed ms bhuttos 20monthold government on 
aug 6 citing widespread corruption abuse of power and political 
incompetence 
the caretaker government comprised largely of ms bhuttos 
opponents has spent much of the past month trying to portray her 
administration as the most corrupt in pakistans 43year history 
and to weaken her partys electoral chances at least five former 
cabinet ministers and ms bhuttos husband asif ali zardari have 
been charged with corruption 
despite allegations made daily in pakistani newspapers the 
government has provided no solid proof to back up the claims 
western diplomats have said pakistan could lose hundreds of 
millions of dollars in economic and military aid if ms bhutto is 
victimized or if the elections are rigged 
even though she now has been charged many people are skeptical 
about the governments willingness to actually put her on trial 
although most pakistanis showed little sympathy when she was 
dismissed a trial could bring back memories of the events 
following the 1977 military overthrow of her father prime minister 
zulfikar ali bhutto and his hanging two years later

bombing on washingtons embassy row 
jose dionisio suarez esquivel who had been a fugitive until his 
arrest last spring admitted participating in the conspiracy to 
murder orlando letelier who died with associate ronni moffitt when 
a bomb exploded beneath their car on sept 21 1976 
two topranking officials of the chilean military junta in power 
at the time of the killing are also charged with participating in 
the conspiracy but the chilean government has refused to extradite 
the former officials 
two other men have pleaded guilty in the case 
suarez 51 pleaded guilty to conspiracy to murder an 
internationally protected person 
the offense carries a possible life sentence but in a deal 
accepted by us district judge aubrey e robinson jr suarez will 
not receive more than a 12year prison term no date was set for 
sentencing 
under the plea agreement prosecutors agreed to dismiss four 
other charges against suarez the government also promised not to 
prosecute suarezs wife elizabeth gongora suarez for concealing a 
fugitive 
mrs suarez sobbed softly as her husband entered the guilty plea 
in federal court 
suarez was arrested april 11 in st petersburg fla where he 
had been living with his wife and son who is now 20 months old 
letelier was an outspoken critic of the military regime of gen 
augusto pinochet which deposed allende in a bloody coup in 1973 
he had served allendes government as foreign minister and as 
ambassador to the united states 
pinochets government surrendered power to an elected civilian 
government earlier this year but so far the civilian government 
has refused to extradite retired gen juan manuel contreras 
sepulveda and lt col pedro espinoza bravo former chief of the 
chilean security agency dina 
michael vernon townley an americanborn dina agent pleaded 
guilty in 1978 to planting the bomb beneath leteliers car and 
served a 40month prison term 
in 1987 a chilean army major armando fernandez larios fled 
his country and pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact 
of the killing 
fernandez told investigators that he believed that pinochet had 
ordered the killing but offered no direct evidence 
both townley and fernandez had been expected to testify against 
suarez who was scheduled to go on trial next week 
suarez a member of the cuban nationalist movement admitted 
that in sept 1976 he met in new jersey with townley and others to 
discuss the murder of letelier according to a statement of facts 
filed by prosecutors 
suarez traveled to washington three days before the bombing and 
gave townley a blasting cap he knew would be used to make the bomb 
the statement said suarez townley and others went to leteliers 
home the next day and planted the bomb on the former diplomats 
automobile 
the bomb was detonated two days later as leteliers car was 
rounding sheridan circle killing both him and ms moffitt 
ms moffitt was a colleague at the institute for policy studies 
a liberal thinktank where letelier worked moffitts husband 
michael who was in the back seat was injured by the blast 
investigators believe that suarez may have detonated the bomb 
with an electronic device from an automobile that he and virgilio 
paz romero who is still a fugitive used to follow leteliers car 
said a source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
defense attorney paul goldberger said suarezs main concern in 
pleading guilty was to enable his wife to avoid prosecution

it just doesnt work that way in our world and if it works 
that way theres something wrong with us as there was in world war 
ii when we sat back and let country after country go saying this 
isnt happening said mrs bush in an extensive interview with

crisis bush has faced in the 20 months of his presidency

crisis she said no 
i think wives in my case under our system do very well to 
aid and comfort their husband and keep trying to make life as

said referring to her 4yearold granddaughter 
millie has not been supplanted she said and despite george

denver whose collapse has been estimated to cost the taxpayers 1 
billion mrs bush said he is under investigation solely because 
hes neil bush hes the only outside director ive ever heard of 
who has been investigated like this 
hes going to be innocent but its going to cost him a lot of 
time and money and grief and business to find out hes innocent and 
i just think its darn unfair that theyre only doing it to hurt 
george bush not to hurt neil bush and they have succeeded she 
said 
at their weekend meeting in helsinki mrs gorbachev pressed her 
for information on how much things cost from lipstick to caviar 
im the worst person to talk to i dont go to a grocery store

jack nicholson on monday was named commander of 
arts and letters frances top award for excellence in the arts 
culture minister jack lang presented the 53yearold star of 
one flew over the cuckoos nest and chinatown with the 
greenandwhitestriped ribbon before a crush of photographers 
your angular eyebrows your ironic smile your taste for 
exaggeration have etched out characters who are memorable 
sometimes satanic lang said at the ceremony the french public 
and i share a great fondness for you 
nicholson was in france to promote his most recent movie the 
two jakes a sequel to chinatown for which he is both star 
and director 
accepting the honor nicholson said in halting french reading 
from a note i hope that the quality of my french will not make 
you take back this decoration which i consider a great treasure 
thank you my friends for coming 
in an interview with the television network la cinq nicholson 
called france his second country and said ive had such 
wonderful luck here i dont think that happens too often i had 
been working for a long time as an actor befor i went to cannes the 
first time officially 
that was in 1968 when the film easy rider was first shown 
publicly he said 
asked which directors work he admired most he cited orson 
welles john huston and akira kurosawa 
you have to borrow somewhat the techniques of the people who 
know how to make this kind of material stand up and welles of 
course is one of the greats nicholson said 
i think john and kurosawa have a lot in common about how they 
handle action not too many points of view i remember how after 
john had made the dead he said you know jack im very 
interested to see how the american public will react to a film in 
which the most dramatic thing that happens is the breaking of a 
wishbone i thought this guy was very big 
nicholson who played the villain joker in the blockbuster 
batman said he had developed a new rapport with children since 
that film which spawned an entire industry of spinoff goods from 
lunch boxes to bed sheets 
i worked in the theater in grand guignol productions designed 
to shock and horrify audiences so i understand the mixture of the 
children and the adult audience he said 
for instance a lot more children talk to me since batman and 
they all love the joker theyre crazy over the joker which might 
worry someone hes after all not really a nice man he said 
but if you ask the same child who they want to be they want 
to be batman which i think is the way that form works

movies as the shining and the border was his american

tourist souvenirs

freely on the streets their governments have agreed to unify on

the oilrich middle eastern countries are 
coming forward quickly with multibilliondollar pledges of support 
for the campaign against saddam hussein but the united states is 
having a tougher time with its european and asian allies a fact 
that hasnt gone unnoticed in congress 
secretary of state james a baker iii announced monday that 
saudi arabia the united arab emirates and the exiled government of 
kuwait had pledged 12 billion to help pay for the us defense of 
the persian gulf and to assist poor nations hurt by their adherence 
to the trade embargo against iraq 
but treasury secretary nicholas brady who heading up a second 
highlevel fund raising mission had far less success in obtaining 
additional support from france britain south korea and japan 
the european community did vote friday to supply 2 billion in 
economic assistance to egypt turkey and jordan the three 
frontline states which have been hardest hit by the crisis 
however the 12nation european community said they would not 
pay to support the us military presence in the region 
with the exception of britain and france which are already 
involved in the military effort european nations have been leery 
of making military contributions preferring the 
lessconfrontational approach of supporting poor nations hurt by 
the embargo 
brady also came away essentially emptyhanded following stops in 
south korea and japan 
south korea which has benefited from us military backing for 
more than four decades pledged to continue funding a few airline 
transport flights to saudi arabia while japan said it needed 
further time to decide how much it can do beyond the 1 billion in 
assistance it has already offered 
to express displeasure with the level of support the senate on 
monday aproved a resolution directing president bush to submit a 
complete accounting of the burdensharing effort by nov 30 
the resolution warned that countries that failure to do their 
fair share could mean a detrimental impact on their relations 
with the united states 
sen john mccain rariz called japans 1 billion pledge only 
a few token shillings he contended that a more adequate 
response given japans economic standing would be an 8 billion 
pledge 
the contemptible tokenism of the actions of the japanese 
government to date merit nothing but the worlds contempt and 
american hostility mccain said if combat arises it will not 
be japanese boys whose lives are at risk it will be american 
boys 
even the 12 billion contribution being made by the oil rich 
states did not impress some us consumer groups who charged that 
consumers from america and other countries were in reality footing 
the bill through higher energy prices 
according to an early breakdown on costs the united states was 
looking for the saudis to supply 4 billion for an economic 
assistance package which will total 105 billion and an additional 
500 million a month to offset us military costs 
but edwin rothschild head of citizen action said the saudis 
stood to make an extra 32 billion monthly from the crisis based 
on a 10abarrel rise in oil costs from the 18 per barrel average 
in july before iraqs invasion of kuwait and a 2millionbarrel per 
day increase in saudi production 
the king of saudi arabia isnt digging into his own pockets to 
compensate the united states rothschild said in reality it is 
american and other consumers around the world who are footing the 
bill for the military it is simply a transfer of money 
both west germany and japan face internal domestic debates over 
how deeply the two defeated world war ii nations should get 
embroiled in military operations 
bakers delegation will not stop in west germany until later 
this week but the government of chancellor helmut kohl has already 
let it be known that while it is willing to offer planes and ships 
to transport us troops to the region it is not willing to offset 
the huge financial costs of keeping american troops in the region 
the bush administration has been stressing the need for a united 
allied front to convince iraqi president saddam hussein that the 
trade embargo against his country will not waiver something 
analysts say is not helped by the lukewarm reception by some allied 
countries 
the appearance of disagreement and disunity undermines the 
effectiveness of the sanctions said kimberly elliott a research 
associate for the institute for international economics in 
washington 
but one official who made the 18500mile odyssey with brady 
insisted that the internal wrangling over details of the 
compensation package was only a temporary setback to the unity 
effort 
its where you come out a month or two from now that counts 
said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity we want 
saddam hussein to look out and see a blank wall around him

for the minimumsecurity section of the adult correctional 
institutions in cranston said prison spokesman joseph dinitto 
pfeiffer who had given mrs pigeon until monday to tell him 
where her daughter elaine yates and the girls were hiding said 
she would remain in prison until she talked 
i feel very sad about it and i wish elaine would come home 
mrs pigeon said later as she and her lawyer pushed through a mob 
of reporters outside the courthouse please come home darling 
with your children we all love you 
but neil philbin attorney for russell m yates jr the girls 
father put little stock in mrs pigeons denials of knowing where 
her daughter and granddaughters are 
i believe elaine will know within the hour what has happened 
this morning she is so ruthless that she would allow her mother to 
stay in prison rather than return the children philbin said 
mrs yates and the children kimberly ann then 3 and kelly 
ann then 10 months left their warwick home in august 1985 after 
mrs yates found her husband with another woman on the family boat 
yates later acknowledged hitting his wife and cutting her 
forehead with a diamond ring when they argued about the incident 
after she left he sued for the childrens custody and won it when 
mrs yates did not contest it he then sued mrs pigeon seeking 
the girls return 
the couple has not divorced because yates says he does not want 
to give his wife the legal opportunity to change her and the girls 
names 
sending his motherinlaw to prison doesnt faze me yates 
said why should it shes going there by her own volition 
pfeiffer already has ruled that mrs pigeon participated in the 
abduction of her granddaughters and conspired with her daughter to 
keep them from their father 
the judge said he disliked sentencing her to prison until she 
talked but we want compliance with the courts order 
when mrs pigeon again refused to talk her lawyer daniel 
schrock immediately requested that she be placed in the 
minimumsecurity prison and that he be allowed to drive her there 
instead of having her taken by state marshals pfeiffer granted 
both requests 
yates said he remained optimistic mrs pigeon would reveal the 
location of his daughters schrock said he might ask the judge to 
review the case in a month or two 
mrs pigeon also has been ordered to pay yates 23000 in 
damages but has yet to do so beginning in may she also performed 
about 150 hours of community service at the society for young 
victims in newport 
enough is enough i think she knows i think no one thought 
this would happen that she would end up in jail said june 
vlasaty director of the society its terrible i dont want to 
see anyones mother end up in jail 
pfeiffer had said he hoped working with the childfinding agency 
would make mrs pigeon sympathetic to yates plight but later 
conceded it wasnt working

a slaying bearing similarities to eight 
others has renewed fears a serial killer is stalking a neighborhood 
where residents thought a suspect was already in custody 
i dont fit the profile but what if the guy gets tired of 
looking for somebody who fits the profile and wants to kill 
anyway asked pat monte who has lived in the frankford section 
five years were all scared 
police said the death of michelle martin 30 resembled the 
others but said they believed it was unrelated 
were not looking at it as a serial killer police 
commissioner willie williams said at a press conference monday 
evening we feel theres more than one person involved 
williams said police were looking for a man with whom ms martin 
was last seen 
the victims were women ages 28 to 68 who were repeatedly 
stabbed or bludgeoned several had been sexually assaulted six 
victims died in frankford a workingclass neighborhood and the 
others were killed nearby or frequented seedy bars in the shadow of 
an elevated railway 
ms martins partially clothed body was found saturday in her 
apartment she had been stabbed repeatedly police on monday

she was described as a large unkempt blonde who wandered from 
bar to bar and sometimes sold soft pretzels on the streets 
she hung out everywhere homicide lt james ferguson said 
she was a bad drinker

of the latest killing she had been stabbed 36 times and mutilated 
christophers courtappointed lawyer jack mcmahon jr said 
monday he would seek to have christopher released on bail 
one of the reasons obviously that hes been held without 
bail is that hes a suspect in these other killings mcmahon 
said unless he dug his way out of the prison and went down to 
frankford and dug his way back in hes not the person that police

gov james r thompson refused to commute the 
death sentence monday of a convicted murderer paving the way for 
illinois first execution in 28 years 
his decision came a day after oklahoma carried out its first 
execution in 24 years 
death penalty opponents kept fighting the sentence even though 
charles walker himself has said he wants to die rather than stay 
behind bars for the 1983 murders of a southern illinois couple who 
he tied to a tree shot and robbed of 40 and some fishing gear 
on monday lawyers representing two other illinois death row 
inmates filed an emergency application asking the supreme court to 
stall walkers death until their case can be heard they are 
seeking classaction status for a lawsuit challenging the states 
lethal injection system 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals in chicago last week 
declined to hear the case before walkers scheduled execution date 
were basically asking the supreme court to hold the status 
quo until we can present the merits of the case said lawyer 
james bailinson 
the governor said people from around the world have asked him to 
stay or commute the execution 
significantly none of these groups include charles walker 
he said if walker is to change his mind and he comes back to 
me then i will be available to consider it and i will consider 
it 
if walkers execution by injection is carried out on schedule at 
1201 am wednesday it will have taken him nearly five years to 
halt his appeals and bring on his death 
some legal experts have said that flaws in walkers sentencing 
hearing make it likely his sentence would be overturned if he chose 
to appeal it 
if the supreme court decided against granting a stay walker 
50 would become the 139th person executed in the united states 
since the courts 1976 ruling allowing states to resume use of the 
death sentence and the first in illinois since 1962 
two other states recently resumed executions early monday 
oklahoma executed charles troy coleman for the shotgun slaying of 
someone who walked in on a burglary the first death sentence 
carried out there since 1966 and in june arkansas executed john 
edward swindler for the murder of a fort smith ark policeman it 
was the first arkansas execution since 1964 
illinois would be the 16th state to resume executions since 1976 
several groups had asked thompson to commute walkers sentence 
including the states roman catholic bishops they wrote to 
thompson saying the death penalty undermines the sanctity of human 
life

rebels who captured him a day earlier 
on sunday breakaway rebel leader prince johnson named himself 
president until elections can be held shortly after does capture 
however loyalists named a successor to the former liberian leader 
liberias main rebel group said monday it would intensify the 
fighting dashing hopes for an early end to the 8monthold civil 
war that has left more than 5000 civilians dead 
the national patriotic front led by charles taylor on monday 
demanded withdrawal of the 3000member west african force in 
monrovia to quell the fighting which has often been tribal the 
rebels have also accused doe of corruption and human rights abuses 
although fighters loyal to johnson control the capital taylors 
10000member army has overrun most of the rest of liberia 
in washington the state department said it had been told by 
reliable sources that doe had died from gunshot wounds suffered in 
his legs during a shootout sunday with rebels loyal to johnson 
a state department spokesman who asked not to be identified 
said us officials considered the reports confirmation of the 
liberian leaders death 
we have been informed by various sources including 
representatives of rebel forces that president doe died from 
wounds that he suffered in the shootout with johnsons forces over 
the weekend the spokesman said 
the british broadcasting corp quoted witnesses who visited a 
johnson camp near monrovia as saying does mutilated body was on 
display there 
the witnesses quoted by the bbc did not say how doe had died 
they said however they watched johnson interrogating doe about 
the disappearance of millions of dollars of state funds during his 
10year rule 
gambian president sir dawda jawara chairman of the economic 
community of west african states said monday now that doe has 
been toppled by prince johnson it might help the peace process 
in liberia 
both johnson and taylor had demanded doe step down 
the civil war began after taylor crossed into the west african 
nation of 23 million residents from ivory coast on dec 24 the 
task force was dispatched aug 24 to end bloodletting that has 
often followed tribal lines 
taylor declared monday that his movement would intensify its 
efforts to bring this crisis to an end by moving into monrovia at 
any expense he spoke in a broadcast over the state radio which 
is behind his lines 
he has repeatedly claimed to be on the verge of seizing the 
capital but has been bogged down in the citys eastern suburbs for 
nearly three months at one point he claimed his forces killed 
johnson 
taylor spokesman tom woewiyu said his group will fight until the 
regional army pulls out 
he accused the west africans of seeking to install a puppet 
government 
they have failed to be a peace force woewiyu told the 
associated press in a telephone interview from burkina faso 
their mission has failed and a prime example is the capture of 
doe by the prince johnson group right in their headquarters 
doe was captured outside the headquarters of the west african 
task force where he had gone to pay an unscheduled visit to the 
forces commander lt gen arnold quainoo 
doe met with johnson and some of his fighters outside the task 
force headquarters in monrovia and they quarreled 
rebels battled the government troops with guns and grenades 
chasing doe and his entourage from room to room of the 
headquarters the fighters captured doe shooting him in both legs 
and carried him off to their camp 
in all 64 people mostly doe loyalists died in the fighting 
on monday johnsons men continued the hunt for doe supporters 
killing an unknown number of people witnesses said meanwhile doe 
loyalists named brig gen david nimley acting president 
liberia has been without effective government for months since 
midjuly monrovia has been torn by fighting involving the two 
rebel armies and doe loyalists 
johnson said sunday he would run liberia until an interim 
government can be installed under a peace plan proposed by the west 
african nations 
taylor has said he would honor the results of elections but 
would want to head liberia before holding elections 
about 2100 us marines are based on ships off monrovia and 
assigned to guard the us embassy and residential compound they 
have evacuated hundreds of foreigners from the city but have orders 
not to intervene in the war 
doe took power in a bloody 1980 coup that ousted elitist 
descendants of freed american slaves who had discriminated against 
liberian natives 
he is from the krahn tribe one of 14 small tribes in liberia 
johnson is the son of a gio and taylor is of mixed 
americoliberian and native ancestry

soviet jews rejoiced and a palestinian diplomat 
protested monday as ariel sharon the former israeli general and 
defense minister made an unofficial visit to moscow 
sharon now israels housing minister and head of a cabinet 
committee on immigration is discussing the possibility of buying 
prefabricated housing from a soviet cooperative and sending fruit 
and vegetables to moscow in return according to media reports 
on monday sharon made an unannounced public appearance shaking 
hands and talking with jews waiting in line for visa applications 
outside the dutch embassy israel maintains an interests section in 
the embassy its only permanent diplomatic representation in moscow 
people in the line said later they were overjoyed to meet sharon 
and receive his assurances that the israeli government would not 
abandon them 
sharon arrived friday night for a weeklong visit and made his 
first public appearance saturday at the citys main synagogue 
where he was warmly greeted by a surprised crowd of about 100 jews 
witnesses said 
there had been no advance notice in the soviet press of his 
visit to moscow 
sharon told the crowd at the synagogue that israel would build 
500000 more housing units enough for all the soviet jews who 
emigrate 
israeli officials expect a total of 150000 soviet jews to 
immigrate by the end of the year and say the influx does not appear 
to be affected by the persian gulf crisis 
according to an american newspaper reporter and others who were 
present sharon called the current wave of emigration which has 
brought a record 80000 soviet jews to israel so far this year 
the most important thing to happen to the jewish people in the 
past 40 years 
the burly 62yearold former general encouraged jews to 
continue to emigrate despite a housing and job shortage in israel 
and said they will make the country stronger 
peace depends upon the number of jews who come to israel he 
said 
sharon is only the second israeli cabinet minister to visit the 
soviet union in recent years the first was science minister and 
former defense minister ezer weizman who was in moscow in january 
and met with foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
relations between israel and the soviet union have warmed since 
president mikhail s gorbachev came to power in 1985 gorbachev has 
loosened emigration regulations allowing a record number of soviet 
jews to leave 
there has been speculation that the two countries may restore 
diplomatic relations which the soviet union severed after the 1967 
arabisraeli war 
tass meanwhile said it had received a letter of protest from 
nabil m amr the palestine liberation organizations diplomatic 
representative in moscow 
amrs letter called sharon the key figure responsible for the 
massacre in the palestinian refugee camps of sabra and shatila in 
lebanon in 1982 according to tass lebanese christian militiamen 
allied with israel committed the massacre 
amr also blamed sharon for the destruction of thousands of 
palestinian and lebanese houses tass said

as washington and manila prepare to 
resume talks on a treaty to keep us military bases in the 
philippines the us government issued a travel advisory monday 
warning of increased threats to americans 
a filipino lawmaker denounced the state department advisory on 
monday saying it was part of a plan to move the site of the talks 
expected to begin next week from the philippine capital to 
washington 
an agreement to maintain the six us military bases in the 
philippines is due to expire sept 16 1991 and a new treaty is 
required to keep them open 
last week us authorities at the clark air base and subic bay 
naval base banned nonessential travel outside the facilities 
because of threats from the communist new peoples army 
two us airmen were killed by the rebels on the eve of the 
first round of the talks last may the rebels have warned of more 
such attacks to demonstrate their opposition to the bases 
opponents of the bases say their presence compromises philippine 
sovereignty 
in its travel advisory the state department warned of 
continuing threats to us citizens in the philippines 
these threats are heightened in the period surrounding the 
philippineus base negotitiations it said 
the us embassy estimates there are about 140000 americans in 
the philippines including 40000 affiliated with the us military 
the advisory said those at risk include americans who are 
employed by the us government or private firms those living near 
us military or diplomatic facilities and those who visit places 
patronized by other americans 
the state department noted that the us government suspended 
the peace corps program in the philippines earlier this year 
because of rebel threats it said americans should not travel to at 
least 11 provinces in which communist guerrilla moslem 
secessionists or criminals are active it also warned that the 
security situation could change in major tourist destinations and 
other relatively peaceful areas 
philippine sen aquilino pimentel said the travel advisory was 
meant to show that the philippines has falled into anarchy and 
chaos to justify moving the talks outside the country 
pimentel said a change of venue for talks would put filipino 
negotiators under a lot of pressure 
considering all these efforts to destabilize the philippines 
and the filipino people by the us itself i do not think our 
negotiators will have any chance at all to articulate what is 
to the best of our national interest pimentel said 
a new treaty to keep the us bases open will require the 
approval of twothirds of the 23member senate where there is 
strong antibase sentiment

connecticuts two masonic lodges 
traditionally racially segregated christian organizations met in 
an unprecedented joint service that band leader lionel hampton 
hailed as a blow to prejudice 
this is the first time ive witnessed it and im so happy to 
be here said hampton who was keynote speaker at the joint 
service sunday 
hampton said the meeting of black and white masons symbolized 
what the group was long meant to stand for 
brothers are supposed to work together and meet together and 
have strength and unity he said this is love peace and 
harmony breaking down prejudice and kicking it in the pants he 
said ive finally seen it come to pass that the black and white 
brothers can meet together 
the two lodges one with 28000 whites and the other with 2000 
blacks last year became the first masons lodges in the united 
states to grant mutual recognition and certain membership 
privileges to each other recognition allows a mason to attend 
services or participate in activities in another jurisdiction 
the masons are a christian nondenominational group with 3 
million members in the united states and 6 million worldwide 
st johns lodge no 6 in norwalk was the site of the gathering 
sunday which brought together members of the white grand lodge of 
ancient free and accepted masons with members of the black prince 
hall grand lodge of free and accepted masons 
connecticut is one of only four states with a policy of joint 
recognition mason officials said sunday the others are nebraska 
washington and wisconsin 
we got criticized for it said grand chaplain ervin l betts 
of connecticuts grand lodge for instance the state of 
louisiana will not recognize any of our masons now 
betts said masonic lodges in several states are planning to 
abolish racial divisions and extend recognition to one another 
although racially mixed lodges are virtually nonexistent betts 
said sundays service was a good first step in that direction 
i think its marvelous he said what was so beautiful 
about this was that both blacks and whites helped bring this 
about 
hampton said the event highlighted his 52 years as a mason 
this means so much he said i applaud these people its 
so good when people like this get together weve never had this in 
masonry before

officials decided monday that yoga isnt so 
devilish after all 
during a special meeting monday night that drew about 100 
spectators members of the toccoa city commission the stephens 
county commission and the county recreation board decided they 
would allow yoga enthusiasts to practice their exercises in a 
county recreation center 
but in an attempt to appease those in this small northeast 
georgia town who believe yoga is a form of devil worship the yoga 
classes will wont be sponsored by the county or funded with tax 
dollars 
the move reversed a decision last week to cancel a class after 
some residents complained 
phillip lawrence a local chiropractor who has led the fight 
against yoga said last week those who practice it are opening the 
door to the devil 
the people who are signed up for the class are just walking 
into to it like cattle to a slaughter he said last week half 
of yoga is a branch of eastern mysticism and it has strong occult 
influences

stalled budget talks between 
bush administration officials and congressional leaders reached the 
negotiators selfimposed deadline monday and participants began 
complaining publicly about the lack of progress 
i would say the talks are going nowhere fast treasury 
secretary nicholas brady declared 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash called bradys remarks 
inappropriate and not helpful yet he conceded that work has 
gone slowly and began lessening expectations by predicting 
agreement by the end of the month 
while some progress has been made there was a hope that we 
would make more by this time he said 
for a fourth day bargainers haggled in the privacy of the 
officers club of andrews air force base in maryland 10 miles from 
the capital with little progress to report house majority leader 
richard gephardt dmo the democrats chief negotiator canceled 
a scheduled white house meeting with president bush 
late monday the sessions took a turn for the contentious when 
republicans rejected a new democratic proposal said a source 
familiar with the talks 
democrats offered to accept 100 billion in cuts over five years 
in their cherished domestic spending programs the official said 
the first democratic offer on those programs called for overall 
increases of 41 billion 
they also eased their demands for slashes in the pentagons 
budget from 260 billion over five years to 200 billion and they 
said they would settle for 130 billion in new taxes and fees over 
five years rather than 200 billion 
but the official said that republicans labeled the offer 
inadequate a reaction that angered democrats and caused them to 
question the good faith of the republicans said the source who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
in addition to bradys comment on abcs good morning 
america white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said chief of 
staff john sununu had indicated there was wide disagreement on most 
areas taxes spending cuts and the military budget 
so were still hopeful but its looking less and less 
optimistic for a quick agreement fitzwater said 
the negotiators want to devise a package of tax increases and 
spending cuts that would slice 50 billion from next years budget 
deficit and save 500 billion over five years next years 
shortfall will be at least 250 billion a record unless savings 
are found a level that would trigger automatic spending cuts 
before the talks began bargainers said they had to shake hands 
on a deal by monday to give congress time to enact it by the oct 1 
start of the coming fiscal year 
with the sessions producing little progress participants have 
begun to talk about perhaps finishing in time for bushs scheduled 
speech tuesday night to a joint session of congress 
but some negotiators are beginning to fear that the talks wont 
produce fruit until after oct 1 
if there is no deficitreduction plan in force by that day the 
grammrudman law will automatically pare government spending by 
100 billion democrats and republicans agree that a cut of that 
depth out of the 12 trillion federal budget would be intolerably 
harsh 
im optimistic that well get a deal at some point brady 
said im not optimistic that these particular talks will produce 
it in time 
the frustration was spreading to lawmakers left behind on 
capitol hill some of whom began urging bush to turn up the heat 
hes reaching the point where he really needs to go over the 
head of congress to the american people and sock it to the 
congress for not being serious about reaching an agreement sen 
trent lott rmiss said on the senate floor 
participants said fundamental disagreements remained over how 
deep to cut defense and domestic programs and whose taxes should be 
raised 
democrats want to pare at least 13 billion from the 303 
billion defense budget about 8 billion more than republicans 
democrats were also trying to limit reductions in benefit 
programs such as medicare although officials have said the two 
sides were trying to complete a package that would cut those 
programs by about 10 billion 
the two sides agree that about 25 billion in new revenues is 
needed but are clashing over how to raise the money 
democratic proposals have focused on raising taxes for the 
wealthy and imposing new energy gasoline and alcohol levies 
gop tax offers have included higher rates for beer and alcohol 
and reducing the federal income tax break for state and local taxes 
one major dispute has been over the administrations insistence 
that the capital gains tax rate be cut 
republicans say cutting the rate at which profits on the sale of 
property is taxed would raise government revenues by encouraging 
more transactions but democrats who say the proposal would 
disproportionately help the wealthy are insisting on a tradeoff

interior minister aryeh deri said monday that a 
ruling body of his ultraorthodox shas party will meet this week to 
consider its political future raising fears the party may bring 
down the governing coalition 
the upcoming meeting of the council of torah sages is linked to 
the widening deri affair known as israels watergate 
the affair has eclipsed the persian gulf crisis in the israeli 
media and threatened prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing 
coalition that needs shas support to govern 
shamirs coalition enjoys the backing of 62 legislators in the 
120member knesset or parliament and is likely to collapse 
without shas five lawmakers 
deri is under investigation for allegedly channeling public 
funds through local government councils to religious insitutions 
run by shas deri who was questioned by police last week denies 
these allegations 
the case also involves wiretapping and police are investigating 
reports that deri supporters allegedly bugged the telephones of 
more than 20 journalists and potential witnesses to block 
prosecution 
on monday deri said shas backers wanted the party to quit the 
government and that shas was losing control 
the council of torah sages which determines what shas does 
will meet in the next two days since there are very strong 
reactions from the public deri said on israel television 
i receive hundreds of telephone calls at my home and office 
people dont understand you are in the government the police 
belong to the government and the press all this slander campaign 
and nobody comes out and says stop enough and they are 
rebellious 
deris implicit threat was the most serious so far to shamirs 
government installed in june after a political crisis engineered 
by the centerleft labor party now israels main opposition group 
justice minister dan meridor of shamirs likud bloc said in a 
speech in jerusalem on monday that israels legal system will 
oppose any attempts at political interference 
the legal system acts and will act without external influence 
not in order to please political personalities or 
organizationsbut to maintain the rule of the law one law for 
all meridor said 
in the latest development in the deri case a tel aviv court on 
monday ordered the top aide to the minister zvi yaakobson held 
for a week on suspicion that he misappropriated government funds 
judge yitzhak baraz said police had substantial suspicion that 
yaakobson deris spokesman either pocketed the money or funneled 
it into religious institutions for the minister according to the 
report carried by israel radio and armed forces radio 
national police spokesman ron ishayahu refused comment 
yaakobson was detained sunday with five other deri aides who 
were released later that day on monday three of the aides 
including deris communications adviser yossi shvinger were called 
back two of them were later released 
some politicians have called for deri to step aside until the 
probe is completed attorney general yosef harish could order deri 
to step down but has said he would wait with the decision until 
being briefed by investigators 
at this point we dont know if the evidence points to the 
guilt of the suspect or the innocence harish said on israel 
radio 
deri said he had no plans to step aside 
i fully trust the judicial system deri said

a former state senator pleaded guilty 
monday to charges of trading his vote for cash and joined two other 
former south carolina legislators awaiting sentencing after similar 
pleas 
i made a very bad mistake and im going to have to suffer the 
consequences rick lee said after us district court judge 
falcon b hawkins accepted his plea were looking for the best 
but preparing for the worst 
meanwhile court papers filed monday by us attorney bart 
daniel allege that state rep luther taylor took 2800 from 
lobbyist ron cobb in exchange for voting to uphold a computer 
contract 
a computer company cobb worked for had won the contract from 
clemson university taylor sat on a panel reviewing the contract 
taylor hasnt been charged in connection with the computer 
contract but he has been charged with taking 4300 from cobb to 
vote for a parimutuel betting bill taylor has pleaded innocent in 
that case 
the allegation concerning the computer contract was included in 
the prosecutions court papers in response to a request by taylors 
attorney that the government detail all the evidence it has against 
him 
former reps robert brown and daniel winstead entered guilty 
pleas last week in federal court 
the lawmakers will be sentenced in about 30 days after a 
presentencing report has been completed by the us probation 
office 
lee faces up to 20 years in prison and a 250000 fine 
lees laywer mike spears said he doubts lee knows anything 
which would help the fbi but federal authorities have said more 
indictments may follow 
a republican from boiling springs lee resigned his senate seat 
two weeks ago after being charged in august with violating the 
hobbs act a federal law banning acceptance of money or gifts in 
return for votes or favors 
cobb a former house member was working undercover for the fbi 
in the 16month investigation of statehouse corruption codenamed 
operation lost trust 
he told legislators he was paid by the alpha group investors 
with headquarters in atlanta and made it clear he was paying cash 
for votes and support 
fbi special agent michael clemens told the court monday that in 
early may rep robert kohn told lee that cobb would pay him 1000 
for his efforts in getting the parimutuel betting bill voted out 
of the senate judiciary committee and 2000 if it was actually 
voted out 
lee then met with cobb and indicated his willingness to accept 
the money and on may 11 cobb paid lee 1000 clemens said 
lee contacted the members of the committee asking their support 
for the bill when he determined a majority would vote in favor of 
it he had the committee polled a procedure in which the 
members vote without the committee meeting as a whole 
the committee voted the bill out may 23 the next day cobb and 
lee met in cobbs office in the atampt building in columbia and lee 
took 2000 from cobb a videotape of that meeting was played for 
the court monday 
the parimutuel bill would have allowed citizens to vote on 
whether to permit betting on horse and greyhound races the bill 
was never acted upon by the full senate 
when lee resigned aug 27 he admitted taking money but called 
his role in the scandal minor 
kohn and taylor have pleaded innocent pending the resolution of 
the charges and kohn has withdrawn from his reelection bid house 
speaker bob sheheen has suspended both kohn and taylor

animal rights activists asked a federal judge 
monday to stop the new england aquarium from trading a dolphin to 
the navy alleging the aqyarium has no legal permit to possess the 
mammal 
whether we get it a stop to the trade by agreement or 
whether we get it by injunction we dont care said steven wise 
a lawyer for the group citizens to end animal suffering and 
exploitation 
wise who filed the suit in us district court in boston said 
an informal letter of agreement between the navy and new england 
aquarium would not be a legal transaction for the dolphin he said 
the trade requires a formal permit from the national marine 
fisheries service 
aquarium spokeswoman audrey conley said the aquarium followed 
fisheries services procedures and received appropriate documents 
for the dolphin 
roddy moscoso of the fisheries service in washington said we 
consider the dolphin rainbow to be legally residing at the 
aquarium 
over the weekend the coalition and other animal rights groups 
protested outside the aquarium after learning of a proposed deal to 
trade a male dolphin named rainbow to the naval ocean systems 
center in san diego calif for a partly deaf female dolphin 
the aquarium said rainbow must be moved because it has become 
too agressive to get along with other dolphins 
john h prescott the aquariums executive director said 
saturday that public interest led him to rethink the swap but the 
aquarium spokeswoman said monday that no decision has been reached 
opposition to the trade stems from reports that the navy trains 
dolphins to kill enemy frogmen the navy says it trains and studies 
142 marine mammals in classified underwater surveillance and 
detecting and marking objects for recovery

three armed men tossed gasoline bombs into a 
crowded mahjong parlor early tuesday setting it ablaze and killing 
six people police said 
another 23 people suffered burn injuries police said 
they said the incident appeared related to growing rivalry among 
hong kongs organized crime syndicates the triads 
the men wielding knives burst into the club and dining hall in 
the crowded hung hom section at 245 am subdued a staff member 
and then set the place ablaze by tossing firebombs on the floor 
police said 
they escaped in a car which had been waiting outside the first 
floor club one of hundreds in this british colony that features 
mahjong a chinese game of dice and dominoes 
the blaze spread rapidly through the woodfoundation building 
and was quickly upgraded to a threealarm fire 
firefighters extinguished the fire at 411 am inside police 
found six bodies another 23 people 19 men and four women were 
taken to queen elizabeth hospital for treatment 
in all 40 people were in the club at the time of the attack 
the attack was the latest incident in hong kongs current crime 
wave fueled by guns drugs and criminals from communist china and 
the apparently growing power of local criminal gangs 
in the past two weeks four gangs have robbed a total of 2 
million worth of jewelry and gold during one robbery an innocent 
bystander was killed and a 16yearold girl taken hostage 
according to police figures homicide is up 42 percent so far 
this year rape has jumped 24 percent and armed robbery has more 
than doubled 
the growing crime rate is occurring against a backdrop of 
anxieties about the future of this british crown colony after 1997 
when communist china resumes control of the territory 
china has promised to maintain hong kongs capitalist economic 
and social system for 50 years after the takeover but few hong 
kong residents have faith in chinas promises 
social workers report a marked increase in young people using 
soft drugs such as marijuana and an amphetamine called 
mandrax which are easily smuggled in from china 
the influence of the triads loosely knit criminal 
organizations is also growing possibly fueled by a sense of 
helplessness among hong kongs poorer youth about the colonys 
future

produce photographic negatives for parties in a lawsuit stemming 
from a 1985 fatal car accident 
encinias said after a brief hearing sept 4 that the journals 
constitutional privilege to protect its newsgathering materials

seeking pictures of an auto accident from a newspaper photographer 
said journalists should be compelled to surrender evidence that is 
vital to a private lawsuit 
if a recalcitrant reporter who has photographs cannot be 
sanctioned by contempt the right to a fair trial is not 
protected attorney michael zuk told the court 
he contended someone who sues or is sued in a civil case has the 
same constitutional right to a fair trial as a criminal defendant 
the court ruled in may that a reporter can be required to testify 
or provide unpublished notes or other material in a criminal case 
if there is a reasonable possibility the information would help the 
defendant 
c michael cooney lawyer for the santa barbara newspress 
argued that the states voters had settled the issue when they 
added the shield law to the california constitution in 1980 
reporters are out there in communities witnessing the kind of 
events that end up in courts he said that newsgathering 
function is one that our society the voters have chosen to 
protect with a shield against contempt orders cooney said 
he said the exception the court recognized in may for criminal 
cases should not apply to civil suits where the constitutional 
right to a fair trial if it exists has a lesser status than 
rights against the state in criminal cases 
the case stems from a june 1984 crash on a us 101 onramp 
newspress photographer robert ponce took pictures of the accident 
scene two of which ran in the paper volkswagen of america sued 
by an injured passenger sought ponces unpublished photos as 
evidence 
santa barbara county superior court judge patrick mcmahon 
ordered the newspaper to release the photos saying they showed 
public events and were not confidential the 2nd district court of 
appeal disagreed saying the shield law lets a reporter or 
photographer withhold all unpublished material in suits between 
other parties 
in its may ruling the state supreme court said the shield law 
applied to nonconfidential material but did not say whether a 
criminal defendants ability to compel needed evidence from 
journalists would also cover civil damage suits

polands broadcasters having won some 
longsought liberties as communist control withered away are 
experiencing growing pains as it enters the free flow of 
information the nations chief of television and radio said 
polish media formerly were hampered by government controls on 
the content of broadcasts now they contend with such problems as 
angry politicians complaining they dont get enough air time 
bureaucratic obstacles to the search for information and potential 
competition from other news outlets 
it is normal in the school of democracy we are in a 
transitive period andrzej drawicz president of the committee of 
polish radio and television said sept 4 
drawicz a highranking member of solidarity who was jailed 
during his nations period of martial law told a conference of 
cable news networks international contributors in atlanta that the 
newfound freedom in his nation has been exhilarating 
he described a news system prior to the fall of polish 
communism that was based on ironclad government control 
the media were first of all not to shape the peoples 
comprehensive attitudes not to teach how to live and how to help 
living but to provide a primitive and simplified consolidation of 
the monoparty communist rule drawicz said 
for example he recalled one evening in 1982 when the start of a 
national news broadcast was delayed 20 minutes because officials 
decided the announcers sideburns were too long the man was 
whisked from the studio shaved and brought back 
the challenges are different now he said 
the leaders of the new parties watch us with mistrust 
drawicz said explaining that each one wants to be on tv as often 
as possible to air his views they accuse us of manipulation when 
they are not

a union at nbc said 10 of its members were laid 
off because of a new contract the network put into effect last 
month so now it plans a boycott against nbc and sponsors of its 
shows 
nbc denied the accusations of the national association of 
broadcast employees and technicians and characterized the 
threatened boycott as an effort to harass the network 
the skirmish was the latest since nbcs aug 15 implementation 
of a new fouryear contract that the unions members rejected 
twice they struck nbc in 1987 in a bitter walkout lasting 17 weeks 
no strike is imminent this time because the union says it has 
decided to employ what it calls the inside game keep its 
members on the job as its lawyers fight nbcs action 
the 10 union members being laid off work at nbcowned wmaqtv in 
chicago and include mike cunningham a member of the unions 
negotiating committee and secretary of the unions local there 
nabet spokesman john krieger said 
krieger whose union says it represents more than 2300 people 
in nbcs 5800member work force attributed the layoffs to nbcs 
new contract 
nbc spokesman joe rutledge said the 10 layoffs had been planned 
for late last year and early this year but were delayed to 
assist with vacation relief needs during the summer 
the layoffs have absolutely nothing to do with the new 
contract he said asked if more layoffs are planned he replied 
not to my knowledge 
krieger made public an aug 28 letter from nabet to lane 
kirkland president of the aflcio the letter said a boycott 
against nbc is part of the unions strategy to fight the contract 
that the network put into effect 
in addition to nbc the boycott will be against the companys 
owner general electric co and sponsors who advertise on 
nbcowned television stations and nbcs more than 200 affiliated 
stations krieger said 
rutledge responded that a boycott would certainly qualify as 
harassment its regrettable a boycott serves no ones

a surprise audit of 30 radio and tv stations 
indicates most apparently were overcharging for political 
advertising a federal communications commission official said 
sept 7 
roy j stewart chief of the fccs mass media bureau said that 
the charges were not necessarily deliberate and that the commission 
would not impose sanctions pending further investigation 
i would prefer to think they broadcasters are not aware of 
their full range of responsibilities in carrying out the 
law stewart said he said no more audits were planned and no 
final determinations had been made regarding any violations by 
individual stations 
instead the fcc will increase its efforts to educate station 
executives in the intricacies of political advertising laws 
stewart said 
broadcasters said they were making goodfaith efforts to comply 
with complicated rules 
historically the commission has not done a good job of 
educating broadcasters to the various nuances in this important 
area said edward o fritts president of the national 
association of broadcasters 
the fcc can impose sanctions ranging from a letter of admonition 
to fines totaling 250000 
the july 1617 audit indicated widespread overcharging at 16 of 
20 tv stations and four of eight radio stations two other radio 
stations sold no political ads during the time audited 
stewart would not identify any of the stations that may have 
been in violation he said they first would be given a chance to 
respond to the commissions inquiries 
the inspections were carried out in cincinnati dallasfort 
worth philadelphia portland ore and san francisco the 
commission said the stations were chosen because of their diverse 
locations and because they serve large areas

permitting humanitarian shipments of food to 
iraq and kuwait may open the door to broader violations of a un 
trade embargo but the leakage is likely to be small us analysts 
and officials say 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev agreed 
at their helsinki summit sunday to allow food shipments to iraq and 
occupied kuwait in humanitarian circumstances 
they said the united nations whose security council voted aug 
6 to embargo all trade with iraq because it had invaded kuwait four 
days earlier would define the special circumstances shipments 
would be monitored by international agencies 
bush apparently worried that sundays announcement would be 
seen as a weakening of us resolve against iraq said i hope 
that nobody around the world interprets this as our view that now 
there should be wholesale food shipments to iraq

the soviet union has condemned the invasion of 
kuwait but soviet weapons and military experts helped make it 
possible and many of the experts are still in iraq 
on sunday president bush raised the issue of the experts with 
president mikhail s gorbachev at their summit in helsinki there 
had been speculation the soviet leader might agree to pull them out 
quickly 
he didnt but he did say at a news conference that their 
numbers had been reduced from 193 to about 150 and that they 
would continue to leave as their contracts expire 
they are leaving iraq and the process is moving forward so i

secretary of state james a baker iii 
said monday he would go to syria to coordinate antiiraq efforts 
with president hafez assad despite major differences that include 
us listing of syria as a sponsor of international terrorism 
we share the same goals baker said referring to the us 
drive to isolate iraqi president saddam hussein with a strict 
economic boycott and to confront him with an international ground 
and sea force 
however the united states considers assad one of the more 
radical arab leaders in the middle east and baker acknowledged 
we continue to have some differences with syria and we expect to 
discuss those differences 
in a news conference at nato headquarters baker also reported 
that saudi arabia the united arab emirates and the overthrown 
government of kuwait would contribute 12 billion to help pay for 
the us defense of the persian gulf and to assist nations hurt

allowing humanitarian food aid into iraq may 
lead to enough illicit trade with the persian gulf nation to help 
saddam hussein hang on longer in kuwait us analysts monday 
but it also relieves iraqs critics of the moral dilemma of 
threatening innocent civilians with starvation in order to put 
pressure on saddam they said 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev agreed 
at their summit meeting sunday in helsinki finland that a 
monthold un embargo against iraq permits food shipments in 
humanitarian circumstances especially to feed children 
the united nations security council must define humanitarian 
circumstances but in the meantime some nations are likely to act

times have been hard for the brazilian 
arms industry largest in the third world but industry sources say 
the persian gulf crisis may whet the international appetite for 
weapons once again 
the iraqi offensive helped illustrate just how vulnerable the 
saudis are to a similar invasion and this should help our sales in 
the medium and long term said a source at the engesa tank 
factory in sao paulo 
there are also excellent sales perspectives in other middle 
eastern nations which in view of the current situation will want 
to build up their defenses he said on condition of anonymity 
its obvious that a crisis such as the one in the persian gulf 
could help our business 
earlier this year engesa and avibras brazils two largest arms 
manufacturers requested protection from creditors for debts of 
about 200 million 
both traced their financial problems to money owed by iraq 
their biggest customer for years during its war with iran arms 
sales are secret but a muchreported figure put iraqs purchases 
at 3 billion 
the demand for weapons in the 8year war when brazils arms 
industry sold to both sides helped make it the third world leader 
knowledgeable sources said iraq which occupied kuwait on aug 
2 still owes engesa 80 million to 90 million for hundreds of 
urutu armored personnel carriers cascavel reconnaissance and 
antiaircraft vehicles and jararaca troop carriers 
a source at avibras who also spoke anonymously said iraq owed 
45 million for several astros ii computer and radarcontrolled 
multiple rocket launchers delivered more than three years ago he 
said it canceled orders for 100 million worth of astros ii 
launchers after they were produced 
other customers in the middle east latin america and africa 
the most important markets reduced or suspended arms purchases in 
the late 1980s making matters worse for brazilian arms makers 
because exports provide 90 percent of the arms industrys 
revenue it went from high profitability to insolvency in a few 
years 
industry experts predict weapons sales will pick up when the 
persian gulf crisis ends as middle eastern countries seek to 
bolster their military strength 
engesa is negotiating to sell saudi arabia the 42ton osorio 
battle tank hoping to obtain a 22 billion order for 320 of them 
the avibras source described his companys expectations as 
moderate but added we would imagine that the countries of 
the region especially saudi arabia will want to improve their 
defenses in the near future and the astros ii would be 
ideal 
he said avibras was seeking other buyers for the systems 
originally destined for iraq 
rene dreifuss of the fluminense federal university in rio de 
janeiro a political scientist and military analyst said the 
weapons industry should not expect a bonanza 
the iraqi invasion of kuwait has completely changed the weapon 
requirements of the regions countries he said in a telephone 
interview from now on they will want highly sophisticated 
armaments brazil does not and cannot produce 
on a sophistication scale of 1 to 10 brazilian weapons rate a 
3 our arms industry is defintely in the minor leagues 
manufacturers attribute the success of brazilian weapons in 
third world markets to their simplicity durability and low price 
after the current crisis is over middle eastern countries 
will want the sophistication of the f15 f111 and b52 warplanes 
and of the m1 abrams tanks dreifuss said 
geraldo lesbat cavagnari of the university of campinas strategic 
studies center said any increase in sales would be shortlived 
he told the news magazine istoe senhor with the end of the 
cold war and as a result of the greater understanding between the 
two superpowers the general worldwide trend is to be more 
concerned with economic than with military matters 
cavagnari said the weapons makers should switch to products for 
civilian use some are doing so 
avibras has increased production of parabolic antennas and other 
communication equipment engesa is making more jeeps trucks and 
tractors 
embraer the governmentcontrolled aircraft manufacturer 
produces more commuter planes than military aircraft 
its most sophisticated military plane is the amx subsonic 
tactical jet fighter produced jointly with italys aeritalia and 
aermacchi 
the amx is the perfect tactical support fighter for the kind 
of conflict now under way in the middle east but so far we dont 
foresee any major sales in that part of the world a source at 
the company said 
iraq iran and egypt use embraers tucano turboprob trainer he

ayala reta traveled thousands of miles to 
reach the land of her biblical forefathers but her journey has 
ended with sleepless nights and frequent bouts of tears 
i want my parents to be here with me she said in amharic 
her native language eyes fixed on the concrete steps in front of 
her 
ayala 17 is a member of the ancient ethiopian jewish 
community which was isolated from world jewry for 2000 years she 
is one of many whose families have been divided by israels 
ofteninterrupted effort to gather in the exiles 
lately the journey has become even more difficult ethiopias 
gondar province where the jews live is torn by civil war their 
departure is said to be obstructed by diplomatic maneuvering and 
questions about their jewishness 
the ethiopians feel their entry into israeli society always 
difficult because of their primitive background has been made 
worse by israels need to absorb thousands of soviet immigrants 
ayala lives at a girls boarding school near gedera a small 
town south of tel aviv social worker ayelet hammer said the 
ethiopian girls are frightened and disoriented by the abrupt 
transfer to a society centuries removed from their villages 
these girls are so alone here so frightened their parents 
wont make it ms hammer said i have never seen so many 
tears 
ayala said she had not been able to sleep or concentrate on her 
hebrew lessons since receiving reports that her parents in ethiopia 
believed she was dead 
ms hammer tried to calm her and said we will send them a 
picture of her to convince them she still exists 
several months ago ayala and her brother left the family in 
ethiopia and walked into neighboring sudan after hearing they could 
reach israel from there she flew to israel via a third country 
which she refused to name for fear of compromising the secret route 
my brother walked out with me but never made it here from 
sudan she said quietly ayala would not say how they were 
separated 
they are taught to keep all these personal things deep 
inside ms hammer explained 
about 15000 jews remain in ethiopia approximately 8000 were 
flown to israel in 1984 after going to sudan in a secret 
ussupported airlift known as operation moses 
the airlift was ended after three months when leaks to the press 
embarassed the ethiopian and sudanese governments 
about 12000 of those remaining have abandoned their homes and 
gone to addis ababa the capital hoping to get on the direct 
flights to israel that began when the two nations resumed relations 
in october 
only about 500 made it each month however and israeli 
officials announced recently that the flow had stopped altogether 
in july 
fears for those in addis ababa increased as separatist rebels 
advanced to within 100 miles of the capital israeli newspapers say 
several hundred may have died of malnutrition or disease 
some reports say president mengistu haile mariam of ethiopia is 
demanding israeli arms as a condition for letting the jews go but 
israeli officials deny it the soviet union mengistus main ally 
and arms supplier for years recently began reducing weapons 
shipments 
ethiopians in israel claim israeli officials use doubts that 
some of the ethiopians are jewish as an excuse for slowing the 
immigration 
because of all the problems here with the thousands of soviet 
jewish immigrants the government doesnt want more arrivals right 
now said rahamim elazar chairman of the public council for 
ethiopian affairs 
israeli officials say verification of applicants jewishness is 
standard practice and has not caused the halt in immigration 
even when children and parents are reunited the modern pace of 
israeli society often changes relationships that existed back home 
ofira taka 20 came to israel five years ago without her 
parents and they finally arrived a few months ago but she still 
lives alone in a hostel for single ethiopians 
i only go to visit them once every few weeks she said i 
couldnt live with them like we used to in ethiopia they dont 
understand me what i have to face in this country they are no 
help at all 
ms taka looked around at her small room and said we had a 
big mud house in ethiopia with everyone around all the time i 
would prefer to be there now 
disruption of family structures is not the only hardship 
ethiopians settled in outlying areas suffer far more joblessness 
than israels 10 percent unemployment rate would suggest 
many train to be mechanics or welders but cannot get jobs in 
those fields said zalmon perlmutter head of a governmentrun 
absorption center for ethiopians 
most wind up working in factories as unskilled laborers so of 
course they want to live in places where there is work in the 
center of the country perlmutter said 
an acute housing shortage caused by the influx of soviet jews 
which could reach 150000 this year has kept the ethiopians in 
outlying towns and lowincome areas 
ethiopians say they are discriminated against in favor of the 
soviets 
shabtai metuka 28 arrived in 1983 but still lives with his 
wife and two children in an absorption center years after he was 
entitled to a government apartment 
i always wanted an apartment where there was work he said 
but finally agreed to live in kiryat gat a southern town with high 
unemployment 
i found a place but was put off time after time he said 
finally they said you cant have the apartment after all i 
went there and a soviet family was living there

yesterdays adversaries can become todays 
allies when they find that they need one another as washington and 
moscow do now 
president bush needed and got soviet backing for the usled 
effort to force iraqs saddam hussein out of conquered kuwait he 
needs soviet cooperation for the creation of a new eastwest 
security system in europe and for arms control deals that may yet 
spare some military spending and produce the elusive peace dividend 
the latter aims mesh with mikhail s gorbachevs goals 
including his urgent need to revive a collapsing soviet economy 
with western support and perhaps with us economic assistance 
sundays summit at helsinki served all those aims it produced 
no further steps to be taken against iraq in case united 
nationsapproved economic sanctions dont suffice both sides said 
they were satisfied 
bush and gorbachev repeated in person the demand their 
governments had made before that iraq obey the united nations and 
withdraw unconditionally from kuwait that didnt alter the 
position of the two powers but dramatized it and brent scowcroft 
bushs national security adviser said their solidarity had to be 
terrible news for saddam hussein 
there were points of difference 
the soviet union long the major arms supplier to iraq still 
has military advisers there gorbachev said they were gradually 
withdrawing and about 150 were left bush said he would prefer that 
they all got out but didnt regard it as a major problem 
gorbachev stressed the summit quest for a political solution in 
the persian gulf bush said that would be best but did not rule 
out the use of force if the embargo and other measures do not work 
bush said that might reflect a difference with gorbachev but he 
also said that one of the keys to their personal diplomacy is that 
they dont try to hide differences but discuss them without rancor 
and concentrate on common ground 
bush said if this crisis had occurred 20 years ago cooperation 
with moscow would have been impossible 
indeed a large scale military move into the area by either side 
would have prompted the other to war talk 
now moscow has accepted the deployment though it wanted 
reassurances that it is temporary that us forces in saudi 
arabia and warships in the persian gulf are there for the crisis 
not for good bush told him the us forces wont stay a day longer 
than necessary 
on the other side us policy for more than 40 years has been 
to keep soviet forces out of the region bush said that if moscow 
decided to send in troops at saudi arabias invitation it would be 
fine with him gorbachev said he had no such plans 
the summit emphasized perhaps inflated gorbachevs role in 
dealing with the crisis that could help strengthen him at home 
where his government is struggling with severe economic hardship 
such a development would be fine with the white house bush 
asked gorbachev to tell him about the economic situation in the 
soviet union and later said that he wants to help improve it 
he said soviet cooperation on the middle east gets me inclined 
to recommend as close cooperation in the economic field as 
possible 
that sounded a little like a cashandcarry deal and gorbachev 
said soviet support cant be bought for dollars although we do 
look forward to cooperation in this very serious time of 
farreaching changes in our economy 
the summit also serves a domestic purpose for bush who 
addressed a joint session of congress tonight on the middle east 
crisis the solid front with gorbachev is both a buttress for 
administration policy and a prototype for what could be a different 
way of handling future international emergencies 
for the first time since world war ii the united states and the 
soviet union are allied in dealing with a crisis offering a sample 
of the new world order the administration has been talking about 
this is a test of the durability of the new approach to 
resolving world problems gorbachev said history dictates 
that a lot is going to depend on whether the two countries can work 
together 
their world war ii alliance ended when the war threat did and 
the enmity that followed shaped the cold war generations 
should the new way of doing business succeed in settling this 
crisis without war and survive to be applied to the ones that 
follow the helsinki summit really will symbolize a remodeling of 
history

the secret diary of laura palmer is 
roughly equivalent to rebecca of sunnybrook farm on a fouryear 
bender 
if twin peaks the television series seemed dark violent and 
just plain confusing dont pick up the musings of its dead 
homecoming queen 
this girl imbibed more controlled substances and indulged in 
more sexual dalliances than the entire cast of a porno movie on 
location at a crack house 
released this week by pocket books the secret diary of laura 
palmer is one of several marketing spinoffs including a cassette 
tape pie and coffee from the mindboggling abc series created by 
eclectic film maker david lynch and former hill street blues 
writer mark frost 
the diary actually is written by lynchs 22yearold daughter 
jennifer and is living proof that the apple does not fall far from 
the tree 
jennifer lynchs first novel is a twisted slice of americana in 
which nothing is quite what it seems and sex is never quite making 
love 
it is vaguely reminiscent of her fathers chilling depiction of 
sexual blackmail in blue velvet 
but laura palmers diary is not cloned from david lynch films 
rather it is 184 pages of ruminations about life in a fictional 
northwest lumber town as seen by its homecoming queen 
it is written of course before her murder which only further 
unsettled an already unsettling place to live 
peaks freaks grab a pencil though the book is billed as 
containing definitive clues that identify lauras killer its not 
easy going 
like the tv series which ended its first season without 
disclosing the murderer the book is crammed with red herrings 
confusing twists oblique references and everything but a simple 
declarative sentence that states laura palmer was killed by 
whoever it was who dumped her body in that lake 
and talking to jennifer lynch about how to decipher the book is 
exactly like talking to her father or frost about the shows 
reeling plot lines 
which means you never get a direct answer 
yes says jennifer lynch with a smile smoking cigarettes in her 
publicists west hollywood office she knows who the killer is 
will readers of the book 
the careful reader will know the clues and who the killer 
is she replies 
what about this bob character in the book and why is every 
mention of his named spelled in capital letters 
thats the way it needed to be she answers 
have we seen bob thus far in twin peaks episodes 
i should probably let that slide she replies 
on the subject of herself and on the inner workings of laura 
palmer the author is thankfully less enigmatic 
jennifer lynch carries herself with a selfpossession that 
belies her age in conversation she refers to her father as 
david and in a clear but undefensive way patiently stresses 
that she alone is responsible for the book 
i had a job to do and i did it she says it was a tricky 
situation at first i wanted to keep my career different from his 
what was the directive from lynchfrost productions when she sat 
down to write the book 
be laura palmer she answers i had to basically become 
her laura was a very troubled very dark girl 
and while the tv series alluded to lauras darker side 
permeated by sex violence and drugs there is nothing equivocal in 
her diary if it were made into a movie the secret life of laura 
palmer would carry an x rating 
beginning with her 12th birthday and ending days before her 
death at age 16 the diary chronicles a young girls descent into 
cocaine addiction orgies prostitution and near insanity 
but sex drugs and murder clues aside the book also manages to 
capture the mindset of a teenage girl caught in the netherworld of 
puberty 
laura alternately worships her mother and thinks her uncool 
worries about the onset of menstruation and with a heartfelt 
conviction available only to teenagers believes she is the worlds 
sole possessor of such confusing feelings 
this is about some of the dreams hopes and fears of any young 
girls life says jennifer lynch weve all been there weve 
all been 12 
but lynch stresses that the book is not an autobiography 
although having david lynch as a father did make for a somewhat 
untraditional childhood 
her parents were divorced when she was a youngster but she 
spent much time with her father who once had a paper route in 
between making early films such as eraserhead 
i used to have very few people who liked me because my father 
was strange and we were poor and we lived the art life lynch 
says 
to her hanging out on movie sets and spending most of her 
childhood surrounded by adults was a completely normal upbringing 
it was traditional to me because it was the only one i had 
she says 
lynch makes her directorial debut this year with a feature film 
titled boxing helena she wrote the screenplay when she was 19 
the story which she calls an obsessive modernday love 
story is about a woman whose boyfriend cuts off her arms and 
legs and keeps her in a box

one of the relatively unpublicized tragedies of 
the lending institution fiasco is that some of the best young 
companies in america may be getting shortchanged 
these are wellrun and innovative businesses they may have 
excellent management fine credit records good products and a 
bright future but they cant convince their banker to give them a 
loan 
the alternative for some of them is to seek money from friends 
mortgage the house go out of business or short of that lay off 
their staffs and go into hibernation until bankings mean mood 
passes 
it is an odd turn of events but its existence can be documented 
in talks with smallbusiness people and by reading the newspapers 
and magazines that report on smallbusiness matters sometimes 
bankers offer the evidence 
what has occurred might not glare out from any of the usual 
statistics but the anecdotal evidence is sufficient to suggest the 
problem is there and many of the companies being hurt had nothing 
at all to do with it 
the problem had its beginnings during the mid1980s when certain 
lenders freed of some of the more onerous regulatory restraints 
and eager to prove something to themselves shoveled money at 
anyone with a business plan 
the economy was bustling and bankers were eager to participate 
and that meant making loans or investments some of those business 
plans were read with less discernment than one applies to the 
comics 
as a result a lot of bad loans were made many lenders got into 
trouble and regulatory officials cracked down no lender wanted to 
remain constantly under the eye of supervisory officials so they 
slowed their lending 
as economic growth ebbed and regulators cracked down officials 
of lending institutions became alarmed at their earlier ways and 
vowed to mend them they imposed a harsh discipline on themselves 
no loans beat poor loans they said 
a rather popular way of demonstrating the new conservatism was 
to replace the chief lending officer with an individual whose one 
overriding goal was to improve the loan portfolio he or she would 
be evaluated solely on that basis 
the head of a soundly managed small company tells how it 
affected him and his experience quite likely is shared by many 
others 
his banker asked him to drop by having experienced an increase 
in sales he approached the bank expecting an improvement in his 
credit line he left with a smaller one i know youll 
understand the banker said 
another smallbusiness person explains how he got caught in the 
middle of the attitudinal change at another bank 
he had purchased an existing but failing business and had saved 
it with a large infusion of capital in the process he had also 
saved the banks loan to the company which had been nonperforming 
at first the bank was thankful but as negotiations proceeded 
for a new loan the businessman detected a cooling of interest it 
culminated with the suggestion that wed be happy if you took 
your business elsewhere 
many of the companies being hurt are very small rather new and 
perhaps operating on a shoestring but smallbusiness organizations 
point out that small is how the biggest began and that tomorrows 
giants are todays babes 
not all the companies being denied credit are risky 
developmental types some are tomorrows leaders or they would 
have been

seven years have gone by since broadway theaters 
dimmed their marquees at the death of tennessee williams but his 
poetic genius burns brightly as ever along the great white way 
this past season was illuminated by stunning revivals of cat 
on a hot tin roof starring kathleen turner and orpheus 
descending with vanessa redgrave 
now five oclock angel his letters to maria st just the 
russian emigre actress who held his quaking hand many an opening 
night and whose unquenchable vitality inspired maggie the cat is 
stirring a kindlier look at this melancholy dreamer whose sad 
descent into alcohol drugs and what he called his deviant 
satyriasis pathetic homosexual cruising led to the violent 
ward and threatened his cobilling with eugene oneill as americas 
greatest playwright 
reading those touching candid letters i was reminded of my own 
chance meeting with tennessee williams six months before the then 
maria britneva mistook for an understudy the unassuming 
vulnerable little man in mismatched socks sitting alone on a sofa 
at a party in john gielguds london house 
i encountered him on a ship the ss america which sailed from 
new york on dec 30 l947 bound out for cobh cherbourg and 
southampton leaving behind the greatest recorded snowstorm in the 
citys history on the day after christmas 258 inches had fallen 
in 12 hours 
i wasnt even a cub reporter then i was a 22yearold college 
senior and exgi on my way to ireland to marry a farmers daughter 
i met on the steps of a church in hochst germany just after the 
war 
the name tennessee williams appeared on the passenger list 
slipped under the door of the steerage class cabin deep in the 
bowels of the ship that i shared with three elderly strangers 
only one of them a refugee piano craftsman from hitlers germany 
going back to hunt for a lost love in the rubble of hamburg had 
ever heard of the playwright he encouraged my youthful idolatrous 
whim to seek an audience with the occupant of the suite on the boat 
deck whose a streetcar named desire had opened to thunderous 
applause and 20 curtain calls just three weeks before 
on a looseleaf page from a lecture notebook i begged an 
interview on behalf of the marlboro college citizen a mimeograped 
campus publication that came out whenever english majors like me at 
that brandnew college in vermont could be coaxed from the ski 
slopes the surly cabin boy who finally answered the call bell 
seemed indifferent to the message entrusted to his care and even 
less unimpressed with the quarter i pressed into his palm but in 
less than an hour down came an answer inquiring if 2 pm 
tomorrow would be convenient 
that was new years eve as the appointed hour approached an 
assistant purser dangling an enormous set of keys passed me through 
the locked wooden gates resembling rodeo corral dividers leading 
from tourist class through the betterlit corridors of cabin class 
on up to the artdeco splendor of first class there a tiny 
elevator attended by a midget in a commodores uniform made the 
final ascent to the boat deck while i tried to review the 
questions i intended to ask my gate keeper prattled on about the 
two blueribbon steers from the chicago livestock fair that would 
make their bow as beef wellington at the captains midnight gala 
ushering in 1948 
tennessee williams was the first celebrity i ever met and still 
lingers in memory as the kindest 
although snow could be seen streaming past the porthole and the 
boat deck echoed with the clank of seamen scraping icicles from the 
lifeboat davits the playwright was wearing a white palm beach 
suit a flowered sports shirt and leatherthonged sandals over 
argyle socks that matched as we shook hands a waiter arrived with 
champagne in a silver bucket and an enormous tub of glistening 
black caviar 
in the intervening four decades no interview subject has shown 
such hospitality yet my host was touchingly apologetic 
i hope you dont find this too pretentious he said in the 
soft southern drawl that imprinted those opening words indelibly in 
memory but i just cant help living it up four years ago 
tonight i was an usher at the strand theater making 17 a week 
with deep musical laughter punctuated by a hacking cough he 
signed the bar chit and peeled off a 20 bill for the delighted 
steward success is wonderful he said proffering a toast i 
wish you buckets of it you are going to be a writer arent you 
and not an english professor 
his anxious tone and the sudden narrowing of those clear blue 
eyes conveyed great compassion for budding authors but dark 
suspicion of future academics who might degenerate into

the cabin steward arriving with fresh towels was invited to join 
me in inspecting the array of bon voyage telegrams plastered on his 
dresser mirror and his christmas toys good luck charms 
treasured from the dec 3 opening night party for a streetcar 
named desire 
that tiny trolley is from marlon and jessica sent the 
southern belle doll he said indicating the gifts from the 
shows stars marlon brando and jessica tandy 
the toy trolley reminded him that another streetcar named 
cemeteries passed by his french quarter apartment in new 
orleans quite appropriate he said more to himself in the 
mirror than to me suddenly his mood became grave and melancholy 
he asked if i had read the glass menagerie i told him i had 
seen it with a free ticket from the stagedoor canteen on an army 
furlough 
then you saw the incomparable laurette taylor he sighed 
almost on the verge of tears i owe everything to her he was 
still mourning the death over a year ago of the alcoholic hasbeen 
shunned for a decade by broadway producers before bringing to 
luminous life amanda wingdale alias edwina williams tennessees 
dreamy doting mother 
staring out the porthole he murmured something about 
streetcar being his last play his swan song this didnt 
seem to make much sense because i had read about another play 
summer and smoke trying out at a theaterintheround in 
dallas 
many years later gore vidal who became his friend on that 
european trip told me williams was convinced then against all 
medical evidence that he was dying of pancreatic cancer 
seven chiming bells in the passageway signifying 330 abruptly 
dispelled his despondency 
soon he was laughing again and stroking his mustache at what 
even then must have been the sine qua non query of all williams 
interviews how did someone born in columbus miss raised in st 
louis and in love ever after with new orleans come to be called 
tennessee 
as he has explained so many times since he was merely 
indulging the old southern weakness for going out on a limb of the 
family tree grandsires a couple of greats back on his fathers 
side had been chancellor of the territory that became tennessee and 
the states first senator and governor 
next morning the mood of the north atlantic changed just as 
abruptly soft grandma moses snowflakes gave way to churning seas 
flying spume beaded with ice and an eerie keening wind that made 
doors leading to the decks almost impossible to push open 
even on the calmest sea the 33500ton ss america rolled 
relentlessly no wonder in her wartime interlude as the troop 
transport west point she had been chosen for operation seasick 
a controlled test of a new maritime palliative called dramamine 
now the piano in the lounge had to be lashed down and 
fiddles little wooden guard rails were raised on the tables 
in the nearly deserted dining salons to keep crockery and glassware 
from careening to bits 
to escape the retching sounds and odors of my stricken mates in 
that airless inside cabin i set about exploring the ship i 
lurched and grabbed my way down endless staircases past the engine 
room and the coiled anchor chain to the swimming pool the only 
one in the water which rose and fell like a giant indoor wave was 
tennessee williams doing situps beside the pool were several 
young men whose sweat shirts identified them as members of the us 
bobsled team keeping in shape for the winter olympics at st 
moritz 
waving me over the playwright climbed out toweled off and 
groped through the pocket of his paisley robe for an envelope it 
was an invitation for the following evening to his delayed new 
years party which had to be delayed again because of the storm 
when the gale finally subsided my uniformed gatekeeper with the 
bandolier of keys escorted me up to the first class suite only a 
few guests including the captain and the ships doctor who looked 
a bit queasy gathered around the punch bowl i remember a very 
pretty french girl whose father was a wellknown paris publisher 
and some members of a us trade delegation who werent sure who 
was our host the olympics were represented by gus lussi the 
coach and george button the father of figure skater dick button 
who had caught the queen mary and would go on to win a gold medal 
at st moritz 
also there was a coquettish aging actress in peroxide bangs who 
threatened to audition there and then for the role of blanche 
dubois 
for once the shipboard conversation consisted of more than 
blizzard horror stories there was much speculation about henry 
wallaces announced third party bid for the presidency which had 
just caught up with the ships newspaper williams who professed 
little interest in politics spent most of the time handing around 
canapes and topping off drinks somehow he reminded me then of jay 
gatsby quite the loneliest person at his own party 
the last time i saw him dawn was stagelighting the green 
bluffs and gray storage sheds of cork harbor seagulls were 
screaming around our twin smokestacks and the carillon of st 
colmans cathedral was summoning the faithful to early mass 
descending the gangplank to the tender taking departing passengers 
to the customs wharf i heard a voice drawl down from the boat deck 
blessings on your irish bride 
tennessee williams was alone at the rail wearing the good 
luck topcoat he had bought on the strength of favorable notices 
for streetcars philadelphia tryout

new york ap tennessee williams loved the ocean and he loved 
ships 
he first sailed for europe at age 17 on the homeric with his 
grandfather rev walter edwin dakin who led a tour group from his 
episcopal parish in clarksdale miss 
young thomas lanier williams not yet known as tennessee lost 
his wallet and 160 to a pickpocket on the eiffel tower 
accompanied the reverend gentleman to the follies bergere and was 
thrilled by the gothic grandeur of colognes cathedral which 
he first viewed from a steamer on the rhine 
beginning with a stormy crossing on the ss america as the year 
1947 ended williams sailed for europe almost every year and 
sometimes crossed the pacific on ships to bangkok or singapore he 
was a passenger on the queen mary ile de france liberte andrea 
doria queen elizabeth united states president cleveland the 
qe2 the oronsay and the vulcania which he said was his favorite 
ship 
to him leisurely ocean crossings were essential to the 
freedom of a writer which he defined in his memoirs as 
the freedom to stop when you please to go where and when you 
please it means to be a voyager here and there one who flees many 
hotels sad and happy without obstruction and without much

editors note hes one of the nations top physicists a 
whitehaired genius who won the nobel prize for his work with 
subatomic particles now leon lederman is back in the classroom 
teaching students who have no desire to pursue science as a 
profession why its vital that ordinary citizens understand 
science he says because scientific developments are shaping the 
world 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in the class they call physics for poets the 
professor has just finished explaining nuclear fusion 
a hand shoots up can you describe it without using numbers 
the student asks 
thats the kind of question nobel prizewinner leon lederman 
gets frequently these days since he began teaching a physics 
course designed for liberal arts majors 
and he loves it 
heres the man who shared a nobel prize in physics two years ago 
for his work with subatomic particles a man whose previous job 
gave him the power to choose which experiments would be carried out 
on the worlds most powerful atomsmashing machine 
a man who helped find a quark 
now the 68yearold physicist is lecturing students more 
comfortable with quatrains than quarks and who probably never heard 
of him until they got to the university of chicago 
lederman asked for the job he has a passion for teaching 
i think the progress of civilization is very much dependent on 
increasing the literacy of the general public lederman says 
this is a democracy we have votes 
president bush set a goal in his state of the union address this 
year of making us students first in the world in math and science 
by the year 2000 
but the most recent international ranking in 1988 found us 
high school seniors ninth out of 13 countries in physics 11th in 
chemistry and last in biology according to the national center for 
education statistics 
and the most recent science report card produced for congress 
released in 1988 showed that just 7 percent of 17yearolds had 
the knowledge and skills to perform well in collegelevel science 
courses more than half were deemed to have too little scientific 
knowledge to participate in the nations civic affairs 
lederman is attacking that record when he joined the university 
of chicago faculty he specifically asked to teach physics for 
poets 
among undergraduates lederman is viewed as something of a hero 
and something of a curiosity 
you wouldnt expect a nobel laureate to do something like 
that says william wolf a physics student 
with a head of curly white hair lederman looks the part of a 
college professor but unlike some of his colleagues he has a 
sense of humor constantly cracking jokes in his new york accent 
he says hes driven to teach as much by his need for a stage as his 
will to educate 
his successor as director of fermi national accelerator 
laboratory john peoples says lederman is probably the only nobel 
prizewinning physicist who could make a living as a standup comic 
this is a very serious subject lederman says but i dont 
have to take myself seriously 
so he begins his class by clanging a shiny red bell and 
punctuates his lectures with oneliners and puns like freeze a 
jolly good fellow in an explanation of cold fusion 
he can be a little corny says freshman anne tuttle who 
took the course to fulfill a science requirement but even so she 
says he makes physics more interesting more appealing 
lederman began his career in 1951 on the physics faculty at 
columbia university in 1979 he took the directorship at fermilab 
in batavia ill the us department of energys highenergy 
physics lab there he oversaw construction and operation of the 
worlds most powerful particle accelerator 
he helped discover two of the 12 smallest subatomic particles 
that comprise the standard model of the structure of matter the 
beauty quark and the muon neutrino it was the 1961 discovery of 
the muon neutrino that earned lederman and two collaborators the 
nobel prize in 1988 
last year he left fermilab to return to teaching after deciding 
that of all his accomplishments education had been the most 
important 
evidence of his drive to improve science education shows up well 
beyond the classrooms where he lectures 
in aurora ill southwest of chicago the nations only 
threeyear public residential high school for exceptional math and 
science students has graduated its first two classes lederman 
founded the school the illinois mathematics and science academy 
on saturday mornings 100 high school students converge on 
fermilab for saturday morning physics created by lederman his 
first year there physicists who work at the lab volunteer their 
weekend mornings to teach gifted illinois teenagers saturday 
morning physics was the first of about 20 programs for students and 
teachers now running at fermilab all attributable to ledermans 
initiative the programs will occupy a new 1 million building 
funded by the department of energy

in chicago this summer a multimilliondollar academy opened 
for the citys 15000 teachers to improve science and math 
education in the public school system lederman chaired the 
steering committee and envisions it as the first of 25 such schools 
around the country it will hold its first class for teachers on 
oct 15 
we dont have enough scientists like him says us 
secretary of energy james d watkins who has named lederman to his 
new 28member secretary of energy advisory board watkins calls it 
a collection of the brightest minds in the nation 
his mind is so superior that he can go well beyond just 
science and technology watkins says he can go into the whole 
field of human endeavors we all cling to him when we want to 
accomplish something 
lederman next plans to reform the basic undergraduate curriculum 
to give more emphasis to science 
if redefining college education seems an impossible dream 
ledermans colleagues will tell you thats not a problem 
he has this optimism to go places that other people say are 
hopeless says henry frisch a physics professor at the 
university of chicago 
frisch recalls ledermans moxie at a meeting several months ago 
of presidents of universities sponsoring the teachers academy 
he said we dont have a building we dont have a director 
we dont have money and were going to open sept 1 frisch 
said any reasonable person would say no way 
said lederman its very optimistic but why not until you 
fail youre a success 
leon max lederman was the second son of immigrants from odessa 
and kiev who revered education but didnt have any of their own 
he grew up in manhattan and the bronx and entered city college 
of new york a school that in the 1930s and 40s was in ledermans 
words converting firstgeneration secondgeneration immigrant 
students into the american dream 
his interest in science grew out of watching his older brother 
experiment in the basement with chemistry carpentry and 
electrical things that sparked and made zaps 
at city college and as a graduate student at columbia university 
under the gi bill he gravitated to the physics students 
there were many very bright guys and i liked the way they 
talked and i liked the way they thought about things he says 
in physics for poets lederman faces a different kind of 
student a student whom he watches glaze over when he begins 
working equations 
lederman responds with comedy during one lecture he showed a 
cartoon by gary larson picturing a student who asks his teacher 
may i be excused my brain is full 
he provides his students with lecture notes illustrated with 
stick figures and cartoons in one set a diagram of a proton 
colliding with a lithium atom is illustrated with a batmanlike 
burst captioned pow ouch smash 
his attitude is pretty confident that well like physics 
says freshman naomi swinton whose interests lie in urban 
anthropology his attitude is everybody can learn physics and 
everybody should because theres so much happening 
when composing his course outline lederman asks himself what 
do i want them to remember 10 years from now when theyre 
congressmen or tv anchorpersons or newspaper journalists 
lederman says its vital for citizens to understand science 
because scientific developments are shaping the world 
look at this political wave sweeping europe he says in an 
interview it comes from communications it comes from the fact 
that a citizens protest in outer mongolia is read about in a 
village in the amazon its the result of communications which 
comes from quantum mechanics quantum mechanics invented the 
transistor and that changes politics

editors note bill huggins born in london is a photographer 
and picture editor who retired from the associated press earlier 
this year he was just starting to work when the german blitz on 
london began 50 years ago here are his recollections of those 
terrible days in a city under siege 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<TEXT>
in 1938 in case war came we were issued gas 
masks airraid shelters were dug in the london parks 
in 1939 war came in 1940 the bombing began 
we were never gassed but bombs fell all over london in the blitz 
of 194041 and in our streets in forest gate thats part of the 
east end that got the worst of the bombing because the docks along 
the thames river in that district were vital to the countrys 
survival 
after a night of bombing we went to work through streets where 
houses shops and offices had been reduced to rubble overnight 
the ruins were still smoking the people who had lived and 
worked in the buildings were searching for anything that could be 
saved the streets were crisscrossed with firemens hoses 
i had just left school at 14 and was a messenger boy with 
barratts photo press agency delivering pictures to all the 
newspapers in fleet street 
at first it had been a peaceful war our photos of the british 
army in france showed the soldiers doing nothing apart from 
digging holes 
in april 1940 the germans invaded denmark and norway and in may 
they overran holland belgium and france the german air force 
started to attack us and the air fighting in the battle of britain 
took place over our heads 
we went to an airraid shelter near the office two or three 
times but we soon began ignoring the warning sirens and carried on 
work as usual people get used to things and it was exciting to 
look up at the trails in the sky and try to identify ours and 
theirs 
the docks were first bombed on a saturday afternoon sept 7 i 
stood in our garden and saw a mass of black smoke to the south by 
the time it got dark the sky was red with the glow of the fires a 
fantastic sight 
in october and for the next six months in the winter of 194041 
the bombers came almost every night 
so many men were away in the military that anyone from about the 
age of 14 could be called on for duty as fire watchers we put on 
tin hats and stood in doorways and on roofs watching for 
incendiaries small bombs that started fires 
i was outside our house when an incendiary hit the wall and 
bounced into the road showering flaming phosphorus 
it was the only time in the war when i was really scared i got 
as far as picking up a sandbag but i felt helpless then a man ran 
up took it from me and threw it on the burning bomb 
that was the nearest i came to being hurt although bombs fell 
as close to us as 60 yards and broke our windows a cap from one of 
our own antiaircraft shells came through our roof but we werent 
hurt 
a boy named percy who was a friend of mine and lived near us 
came out of his garden shelter as a bomb fell nothing was ever 
found of him all of his family died in the shelter 
the city londons financial district was heavily bombed on 
dec 29 1940 the ap office then in tudor street was burned and 
our agency was damaged mainly by sparks flying off st brides 
church which was gutted 
london burned well that night because it was low tide in the 
thames and the firemen couldnt get water 
when i got to the office the water tanks on the roof were 
leaking through the ceiling alfred barratt our boss bellowed at 
me to get a broom to get rid of this water 
i was cleaning up the water when another staffer said dont 
bother with that go out and get some tea the jug we used was 
the one in which we made up the photo developer 
everything was blacked out at night and there were no street 
lights but i found you can see in the dark better than you think 
what impressed me going home at night in the blitz was the 
cheerfulness of the people who slept on the subway platforms 
seeking shelter from the raids 
thousands would go down at dusk when the underground trains were 
still running and hold singsongs when the blitz eased off people 
continued to sleep in the subway because it had become a kind of 
club people liked the feeling of being together 
the blitz on london and other cities killed 40000 people 
injured 86000 and destroyed 2 million homes 60 percent of them in 
london but people took it in their stride we grew up only a few 
years after world war i and as boys we used to play at britons 
against germans by the time the war began we were already 
conditioned to it 
like thousands of other families we had a governmentissued 
anderson airraid shelter half buried in our garden but we didnt 
like it so my brother george who was still at school and our 
sister maisie who was older and worked in an office slept 
together under the dining table 
when germany attacked the soviet union in june 1941 the bombing 
slacked off it resumed again in 1944 after the allies invaded 
france and the germans began sending over flying bombs and rockets 
i was in a church parade in 1944 in putney in south london when 
we were asked to help out at some houses hit by a flying bomb we 
formed a human chain to remove the debris and look for survivors 
then the guy next to me passed on the crushed body of a baby 
i can see it now

judd hirsch best known in goodguy roles 
plays a crafty rapist in the nbc movie she said no he hopes 
the audience doesnt get the wrong idea about the character 
oh yeah they cast me against type says hirsch the star 
of nbcs dear john and two earlier series taxi and 
delvecchio 
in she said no hirsch portrays a successful lawyer who is 
accused of raping a woman played by veronica hamel he is freed 
when a deadlocked jury results in a mistrial taking the offensive 
he files a multimilliondollar slander suit against his accuser 
i play a rapist but hes a lawyer hes older he looks like 
he doesnt need to do this hirsch says i played him like a 
nice guy because thats the way he saw himself the american public 
might find this guy lovable 
people tend to view an actor as the character ive played a 
lot of nice guys in a string of parts 
in she said no hirschs martin knapek plays to the press 
the jury and the public for maximum sympathy he casts himself as 
the victim who has been falsely accused by a vindictive and 
mentally ill woman youll find the real person buried beneath 
all the words hirsch says 
lee grant also stars as the prosecutor who resigns to become 
hamels defense lawyer in the second trial john patterson directed 
from a screenplay by michael ohara 
this is really the womans story hirsch says it tells 
how it affects her i think what michael wrote is how the legal 
system rerapes her she carries the emotional burden she worries 
that people will think shes as sick as he says she is she has a 
problem with her lawyer she has a problem with the legal system 
evidence that would vindicate her is inadmissible 
we know there are people who can get away with murder i think 
michael was fascinated with that the loopholes that people can 
escape through so when i took the part i couldnt play to the 
results you cant take away his selfesteem you have to play the 
character not only as he wants other people to see him but as he 
sees himself 
during an interview in his office hirsch is eating tiny slivers 
of kosher pastrami at his desk on the desk is a teapot shaped like 
a taxicab nearby is a piano and a huge stuffed toy african lion 
in the sunlight by the window 
hirsch back for a third season of dear john divides his 
time between television motion pictures and the stage he won two 
emmys for taxi an oscar nomination for ordinary people and 
a tony award for im not rappaport 
i dont think youll see a lot of change in dear john this 
year he says the characters are pretty much set and will get 
larger this is not vignette or sight comedy or humor that comes 
out of lifelike things were smack in the middle we want to be as 
funny as we can be this year were going to take the characters to 
the limits kirk will get more insulting ill get more outraged 
hirsch says comedy helps him cope with his own life 
i dont think id be as mature if i didnt do comedy he 
says ill screw up terribly i can scream and yell comedy 
teaches you another outlook i think how john can be silly or 
hopeless and yet be invincible he falls on his face but he always 
comes out right 
hirschs movies include without a trace teachers the 
goodbye people and running on empty his plays include 
scuba duba barefoot in the park chapter two hotl 
baltimore and knock knock 
he made his television debut at the age of 40 in the law in 
1974 portraying a public defender an attempt was made to turn it 
into a series but it didnt work 
two years later he was detective dominick delvecchio in 
delvecchio that lasted only a year and in 1978 he did 
taxi he also starred in a shortlived series detective in 
the house 
through it all hirsch has developed a philosophy about an 
actors odyssey from job to job 
a friend once told me i was a successful failure he says 
he said youre negatively inspired i know more what i dont 
want to do than what i do want to do theres too much pride in 
this country people dont know how to accept failure when they do 
fail they have to lie about it

the vegetarians of love atlantic bob geldof 
 
despite a more admirable second try americans are still more 
likely to admire bob geldof for his philanthropy than his music 
geldof whose role as the leader of the irish band boomtown rats 
during the punk explosion was overshadowed by his work putting 
together the live aid concerts for famine relief is attempting to 
recover from deep in the heart of nowhere that unfortunately 
named 1986 album was a stylistic and commercial failure 
geldof was propped up by superstar guests on nowhere and he 
sounds much more comfortable fronting an eightpiece band on the 
vegetarians of love the sound is strikingly new also for the 
first time geldofs irish heritage shows in his music which is 
driven by instruments like the accordion penny whistles and a 
ukelele 
theres a certain lowkey charm to it all geldofs worldweary 
almost defeated sound is perfect for the tale of lost love in a 
gospel song and his reaching out on love or something 
love is like your clothes he sings on the latter song 
cowritten by dave stewart its only useful while it lasts 
geldofs not a very distinctive writer but he adeptly weaves 
stories even his uneventful date on no small wonder comes 
alive 
two things will prevent this album from significantly expanding 
geldofs audience for one its relentlessly depressing from the 
ugly cover to the last song the end of the world he builds up 
little sympathy for the audience to wallow with him 
second geldof cant sing never could really and its 
probably why his music is so little known here if anything his 
voice is getting worse lowering into a growl that often sounds 
like mark knopfler of dire straits unfortunately he cant play 
guitar like knopfler 
musically sir bob is destined to remain a footnote

to the critics trumpet call that bruce

i been 
the 54yearold actor has been gratefully reading the reviews 
for after dark my sweet a hardedged thriller based on a 
novel by the longneglected pulp writer jim thompson 
a guy in vanity fair gave me glowing remarks but in the 
middle of it he said mr dern has been absent from the mainstream 
movie scene for over a decade 
that almost paralyzed me dern said i just couldnt 
believe it i did almost a movie a year for the last 10 years the 
burbs may not have worked on the level everyone wanted it to but 
it was fun on the edge that championship season those are 
not lightweight experiences 
such comments are minor annoyances 
the nice thing about this film is that its not an unsimilar 
venture to what got me going 20 years ago at bbs a small company 
that made milliondollar films easy rider five easy pieces 
drive he said now avenue is another small company that makes 
the 1990 milliondollar film which is now a 5 million film last 
year it was drugstore cowboy this year its after dark my 
sweet he said 
the film casts dern as a scruffy excop adrift in the california 
desert a boozy widow rachel ward introduces him to a former 
boxer and mental patient jason patric who is conned by dern into 
kidnaping the son of a rich palm springs family 
one of the things that people seem to be appreciating dern 
observed is that im not too far from the well uncle bud has a 
lot of sleaze on him a lot of little moves on him 
if there is a bruce dern role this might be the ultimate 
hes not overtly savage not an overt bad man but hes lurking in 
the area id definitely ask for his drivers license right away if 
i saw him 
how did dern get this way he appears to be an upright citizen 
his only addiction seems to be running which he does for 15 miles 
day in day out 
i began in television as an actor who worked he said by way 
of explanation i didnt have a strong individual leadingman 
persona the jobs i took in order to maintain any semblance of a 
career were roles in this villainous area 
when youre introduced into the movie business they remember 
you in the first strong images they have of you the images of me 
were always as bad guys in television shows or movies 
and what bad guys he was the man who shot john wayne in the 
cowboys the crazy who attacked the super bowl in a blimp in 
black sunday jane fondas warcrazed husband in coming 
home the poloplaying cad in the great gatsby 
dern is quick to cite some of his nonvillainous movies they 
shoot horses dont they smile middle age crazy 
but i dont fight typecasting anymore he sighed 
dern grew up a rebel in a distinguished illinois family his 
father was statesman adlai stevensons law partner a grandfather 
was secretary of war under franklin roosevelt a greatuncle was 
the poet archibald macleish an exclusive prep school failed to 
calm his wild spirit nor did the university of pennsylvania where 
he was expelled from the track team for refusing to shave sideburns 
grown for a college play 
his studies at the actors studio brought dern to the attention 
of elia kazan who cast him in the play sweet bird of youth and 
the movie wild river in hollywood dern found his first steady 
work as jack lords sidekick in the tv series stony burke 
dern is doubly celebrating these days for his own success in 
after dark my sweet and daughter lauras in wild at heart 
its amazing he said with fatherly pride you have a 
daughter who suddenly explodes on the scene even though shes been 
around for 10 years it appears she just arrived in june 
shes what i call a townie even though she grew up in the 
valley instead of beverly hills or hollywood all of the kids who 
grew up here are townies he said most of the actors in my 
generation didnt come from la they came from other lands laura 
and her generation were around films all their lives 
whats surprising to me is the magnitude of stardom they 
achieve at such an early age and the ability they have to handle 
it the kind of professionalism that laura and jason patric and 
nicolas cage have these kids have a whole persona they can do 
this they can do that nothing fazes them it was all kind of 
flustering and flattering when we started out it took us well into 
our forties before we got any kind of recognition that they get 
now 
does he give laura any career advice its not necessary says 
dern 
she knows its a marathon she got in knowing that in the 
marathon the race doesnt start until youve done 16 miles its 
what you do with the last 10 that counts

his first encounter with 
impressionism came as a culture shock for julian alden weir 
he had been in a chamber of horrors he wrote his family in 
connecticut after visiting a show of french impressionists in 1877 
weir was only a late convert to the movement that left a deep 
impact on american art as is demonstrated in a new exhibition 
attracting rave reviews and fascinating european and american 
crowds 
american impressionism on view at the lakeside villa 
favorita gallery is billed as the most important show of its kind 
ever held outside the united states 
the exhibition features 66 works by 26 artists temporarily 
joining the collection of baron heinrich von thyssenbornemisza 
the swiss industrialist it is one of the worlds most important 
private collections of masterpieces from five centuries 
for europeans the new show marks a discovery except perhaps 
for mary cassatt childe hassam john singer sargent and john 
twachtman most of the artists whose works are on view here are 
virtually unknown even to specialists in the old world 
prestigious european encyclopedias make only passing reference 
to the american movement that produced compositions of 
extraordinary vitality according to baron thyssen 
the movement was pioneered by cassatt an expatriate who settled 
in paris in 1877 became a student and close friend of edgar degas 
and remained in france until her death some of her works hang in 
the louvre her refreshing mother about to wash her sleepy 
child painted in 1880 is the earliest dated exhibit here 
the works displayed in lugano by all the other artists were done 
only after 1886 described by guest curator william gerdts as the 
crucial year for american awareness of the impressionist 
movement 
in that year a paris dealer staged a large exhibit in new york 
of claude monet pierre auguste renoir degas and other leading 
french impressionists by and large most americans were 
oblivious to impressionism before 1886 gerdts a professor at 
city university of new york notes in the exhibition catalog 
gerdts says that early in the 19th century landscape had been 
recognized as the most important american pictorial theme one 
that embodied the natural history of a nation that had no 
appreciable human past 
he says that this explains that it was monet the pure 
landscapist who received the greatest adulation among american 
collectors during the next decade the lugano show suggests that 
monets influence also was predominant on the american artists 
singer sargent who first met monet as a student in 1876 
theodore robinson and several others whose works are on view were 
plainly under his spell 
scenes painted at giverny monets home and shown here tell of 
an almost steady flow there of american artists birds eye view 
of giverny recalls robinsons repeated long stays in the french 
village also on view are giverny scenes by john leslie breck and 
dawson dawsonwatson 
the poppy garden by massachusettsborn william metcalf 
believed to have been one of the first americans to visit giverny 
makes the cover of the exhibition catalog 
there is no record of such visits by childe hassam although he 
also studied in france like most other american impressionists 
his oeuvre is represented here by 10 canvases spanning a period of 
30 years most of them are cityscapes including one from his 
popular flag series 
twachtmans shimmering winter scenes and ferdinand friesekes 
painting of women vie for attention as well 
alden weirs renowned red bridge depicting an iron span 
over the shetucket river near his connecticut home is presented as 
a rare impressionist example of concern with work and industry 
a feast for the eye was how the reviewer of the influential 
neue zuercher zeitung summed up his feelings 
irene martin curator of thyssenbornemisza collection said it 
took 18 months to organize the relatively small show works were 
lent by 36 major american museums and 9 private collectors four 
are from baron thyssens own collection 
i think he is really the only european collector she said 
in an interview with the associated press martin an american 
specialist who moved here from dallas three years ago says the 
lugano exhibition is unique because of its comprehensive approach 
including regional artists not even known to most americans so far 
this is the first time a show like this has happened she 
said explaining that exhibitions in the united states focus on 
individual artists or regions the number of visitors has been 
growing steadily since it opened last month 
it is going well and i am hoping it will even get better 
martin said we have also had already a lot of american tourists 
here and they are just thrilled

with his new album spirits dancing in the 
flesh carlos santana wanted the same feeling of oneness 
experienced at the finale of the olympic games 
every four years at the olympics you see people from all 
walks of life joining hands dancing laughing together crying i 
wanted to do the kind of album to create that spirit every day 
he said in an interview at columbia records where he has been 
since his first album in 1969 
as word spreads that santanas in the building it seems that 
every employee comes by to say hello and ask for an autograph 
the first video for peace on earth mother earth third 
stone from the sun he says shows the earth is the womb and we 
are the babies forget about national anthems flags and passports 
and get into onefamily consciousness that turns me on 
the first part of that piece was composed by john coltrane 
the second by me and the third by jimi hendrix 
i met hendrix at a concert he mentioned about joining my 
band musically he knew the band was embracing something different 
than show business that he was being put into we were just kids 
but he knew i think he had enough of show business he wanted to 
seriously play some music 
tramaine hawkins for whom santana predicts big things and 
bobby womack sing on spirits dancing in the flesh santana 
plays guitar 
this is the last album under his present columbia contract and 
his thoughts are full of what he wants in a new contract the 
chance to advise the company about nonmainstream records i 
dont want a big juicy contract with a lot of money i would like 
to create a new branch in the company that deals with people in a 
different way than the predictable only college radio is open to 
experimenting with music programming says the man of whom it has 
been declared he is latin rock 
this company needs a branch of rebels and renegades he 
says i want to work with them there are a lot of bands not that 
predictable the fabulous thunderbirds tracy chapman bonnie 
raitt john lee hooker turn on the radio it is very insulting a 
lot of people dont want the same formula of canned soup they want 
the real gumbo 
i would like to bring my firsthand experiences with the 
streets im trying for music you and i can be revitalized from 
spiritually a lot of people arent dealing with the heart 2 live 
crew and madonna have to do everything controversial to sell 
something im a lover my sound penetrates deeper than a surgeons 
knife because i go all the way to your subconscious 
im not beethoven or mozart but my music is going to last 
longer than the people who service my records theyre like 
generals who make phone calls im in the trenches every day i 
have more firsthand experience with peoples needs than these 
people i have to deal every day to make sure nobody walks out on 
my show after two hours they stay 
i see children and grandparents hip and square black and 
white people tell me how my music consciously or unconsciously 
helped them find their own identity in this world 
outspoken and never at a loss for words santana says that 
columbia records would like him to repeat black magic woman of 
1970 they treat you as a legend and dont put your new records 
in the stores every time i go on the road for the last five years 
its been sold out people are waiting for the new thing were 
going to play 
santana found it frustrating to take the healer which he 
composed and the soundtrack to la bamba to columbia and have 
them rejected la bamba came out on warner bros and the 
healer on chameleon records i did a jazz album with wayne 
shorter two years ago they havent put it out 
he hasnt done music for a film since la bamba 
all the scripts they send me are demeaning to women if i 
cant play music in front of my four sisters mom wife and 
daughters i wont play it thank god im in a position where i 
dont need to do it santana said 
musicians respect me i have a lot of confidence and peace of 
mind because of what i do and how i do it i feel confident about 
my future very few bands can go to jerusalem and make hebrews and 
palestinians dance together or play at san quentin and see blacks 
latinos and whites dancing together for the duration of the 
concert they forget about their hate thats what my band does 
santana is touring the united states next year he plans to go 
to south africa and south america i promised my wife some 
domestic rhythm time the lord gave us a daughter eight months ago 
i need to watch her grow ive tried all my life to balance my 
life salvador is 7 estella 5 and angelica faith 8 months im 
very grateful 
santana left mexcio for san francisco at 14 and has only played 
in his native country twice next march im invited by the 
president of mexico to perform in mexico city im banned from 
mexico all i said was they have to stop imitating the worst of 
american music and get into their own thing 
in 1973 they let me play for rich people in a small bullfight 
ring i wanted to play in a coliseum and have a ceiling on ticket 
prices they said i couldnt because i play rock n roll in 1988 
they let me play in a town kind of like fresno calif 
now the president says im an international musician and 
invited me to come to mexico through the front door with linda 
ronstadt and los lobos if we do seven concerts i want the money 
from three to stay in san diego and collect interest and the money 
to go to a hospital in mexico to take care of children

when robert penn warren died of cancer last 
year only his wife and doctor were by his side 
his death was peaceful at his summer home in stratton vt 
there were no family feuds coming to a head no journalists or 
disciples rushing to catch the last words of the poet laureate no 
hysterical mobs sobbing in the streets 
he had his admirers but they were respectful quietly 
worshipful like jay parini a poet and novelist who lived nearby 
at the time warren fell ill parini was at work on a historical 
novel about the last year of leo tolstoy who attracted worldwide 
attention in 1910 by running away from home and dying near a small 
railroad station the book is called the last station henry 
holt 2295 the story is about an aging author more than one 
aging author 
every book has a kind of secret origin something connected to 
the authors own life said parini a teacher at middlebury 
college whose previous works include the novel the patch boys 
and town life a collection of poems 
one of my attractions has always been to mentor figures older 
people in particular people i can stake my life on thats why im 
interested in writers like tolstoy and thoreau and warren writers 
who are ethical in some way having a way of life i can follow 
he said

in 1879 tolstoy was 51 years old and in the past decade had 
published his two greatest novels war and peace and anna 
karenina he had a happy marriage several children and an 
enormous estate he was one of the most celebrated writers in the 
world 
and he wanted to kill himself 
i would say to myself well fine so you will be more famous 
than gogol pushkin shakespeare moliere tolstoy wrote of his 
midlife crisis more famous than all the writers in the world 
and so what and i had absolutely no answer 
drawing on his own interpretation of christs teachings the 
author devoted himself to selfperfection he called for universal 
brotherhood advocating chastity nonviolent resistance and the 
abolishment of private property and denounced the authority of 
church and state 
his views led to police surveillance and excommunication from 
the russian holly synod but also earned him a devoted sometimes 
fanatical following with peasants and intellectuals alike shouting 
his name in the streets calling for a tolstoyan way of life 
i think tolstoy was vividly and probably painfully aware of 
the fact he was playing a role parini said 
this mother teresa tolstoy was an act he knew in his heart 
of hearts he had been sleeping with all vhese servants that he had 
this tremendously immoral history probably 60 years of corrupt 
actual life if people out there really knew who tolstoy was they 
wouldnt accept him and it terrified him

<TEXT>
parini began the last station in 1985 after stumbling upon 
the diary of valentin bulgakov a tolstoy disciple who lived at the 
authors home in his final years 
the novel is structured like a series of diaries woven together 
tolstoys world was torn by feuds love affairs and the authors 
own dilemma over whether he should flee his comfortable 
surroundings and live among the poor 
chapters are rotated among the members of the household with 
family members and admirers disputing who was acting in tolstoys 
best interests and the writer secluded in his room expounding his 
views in letters and diaries 
the one thing i was amazed about tolstoy is he never lost 
himself in the swirl of this center parini said you look at 
his diaries and his letters the comments he makes to people the 
message becomes even when your life is crashing around you theres 
no reason for you to crash 
with everyone getting in their side of the story the author 
agonized over who should have the last word logically it should 
have been tolstoy the books moral center but parini had his own 
ideas he wanted the final voice to be his own 
parini concluded the book with an original poem his friends 
objected what right did he have to upstage the hero of his story 
how many journalists would show up if parini ran away from home 
his editor was so angry she deleted the poem the writer put it 
back 
i thought it was important to put it before the reader that 
this is fiction and there is an author here controlling all these 
voices he explained its an act of ventriloquism by putting 
my voice last its calling attention to the fact that it is me 
presenting the characters 
maybe that was a mistake it could have been

parini interviewed warren many times during the poets final 
years they would take long walks in the woods go swimming joking 
about warrens advancing years and earnestly discussing the meaning 
of life the grand laureate and his gentle admirer tolstoy and 
bulgakov 
warrens great gift was his ability to understand his own 
imperfections parini said in the last station no one is 
perfect not tolstoy not his family not the man who juggled the 
voices the novel is parinis bridge between two great mentors the 
dying russian begging for forgiveness as he gasped for breath and 
the highspirited southerner whose final poems so nearly uncovered 
his own hidden story 
warren comes as close to a perfect human being as i ever 
noticed he was totally selfless yet had a firm ego he was able 
to live a whole life with no pretension he was able to master his 
art and help people parini said 
warrens poetry came to a head in his last 10 years when he 
wrote his most magnificent work he was going to be dead soon and 
wondered what his life was all about i think tolstoy also wondered 
what his life was all about i think he and warren would have had a 
lot to say to each other

the happy goodman family was rehearsing 
for the dinah shore tv show some 20 years ago when a lighting 
technician descended from a catwalk and stood near them to hear 
better 
as the four singers belted out their famous gospel music the 
stagehand remarked i havent ever heard anything like that i 
couldnt set them lights until i came down and heard this 
the four members of the pioneering gospel music family can now 
be heard singing together again after 10 years of concentrating on 
their individual careers the goodmans have reunited on an album 
appropriately titled the reunion 
a 40city concert series is planned for 1991 howard happy 
goodman wife vestal and happys brothers sam and rusty will be 
back on stage together reaffirming their title the first family 
of gospel music 
its exciting wonderful 68yearold happy goodman said 
about the reunion and the forthcoming tour we went into the 
studio with more vitality and vigor than ever 
there has been a goodman family in gospel music since the 
mid1940s but the four in their best known configuration got 
together in 1963 
few gospel music performers have been such trailblazers 
in 1968 the happy goodman family won just the second grammy 
award in gospel music they have performed more than 3000 
concerts including one on the white house lawn for jimmy carter 
when he was president 
they have sold more than 12 million records and were among the 
first in spiritual music to use drums steel guitar bass and lead 
guitar 
their gospel singing jubilee was among the first syndicated 
tv shows featuring gospel music it aired from 1965 through 71 
rusty goodman has been a prolific gospel music songwriter 
composing sacred standards such as i wouldnt take nothing for my 
journey now had it not been and who am i 
happy and vestal who are pentecostals appeared regularly on 
the ptl tv program in the 1980s 
happy nicknamed by his mother because of his cheerfulness as a 
child looks back on his long career and summarizes his 
achievements simply im proudest that ive been singing with my 
family and with my wife of 40 years singing songs we love to do 
and seeing people rejoice at our music around the country 
along the way happy and his family were never afraid to take 
chances they added the drums steel guitar and other instruments 
when only a piano was standard practice for gospel bands 
they began wearing tuxedos and evening gowns and they demanded a 
decent salary from promoters when other acts were afraid to speak 
up 
rebels sort of we were says 60yearold vestal goodman 
if we felt like it would make it better we werent afraid to try 
it i guess we were pioneers in a lot of things we opened doors 
for others to do things that were not the norm 
adds the whitehaired rotund happy the main thing was our 
public the public had to like it if the people liked it we could 
care less what our peers thought about it 
we had a lot of repercussions about things but the others 
came right along and followed us 
in the early years of their career the goodmans moved to any 
city that offered a radio station with a strong signal to broadcast 
their gospel songs they lived in evansville ind swainsboro 
ga asheville nc and madisonville ky after living in 
charlotte nc for several years they moved to suburban 
nashville three years ago 
there were hard times we traveled in anything anybody would 
sell us on credit goodman said 
they launched their recording career by hooking up with 
nashville song producer russell sims who would take a chance on 
a threelegged horse happy says 
the recording contract led to the grammy in 1968 and a second 
grammy in 1978 by happys math figuring the awards come 10 years 
apart they are two years overdue for their third 
happy and vestal have few if any regrets about their career 
gospel music speaks to the heart and soul of people it makes 
you laugh or cry it lifts the soul of man vestal says 
adds her husband ive been going good for 50 years ive 
never drawn a salary or been on a payroll except for gospel music 
theres no use quitting now

buying a home is supposed to be the american 
dream for many people that dream has been dampened by the effects 
of the savings and loan crisis which has made victims of both 
buyers and sellers this the second of a threepart series sampls 
on main street examines how the crisis has battered one 
midsized city 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in many places the savings and 
loan crisis seems a faroff fury unknown people swindling faceless 
institutions in complicated ways with vague consequences 
but in colorado springs as in many cities across the country 
the consequences have undermined everyday life by exacerbating an 
already depressed economy 
three of the six local sampls went under this year a surviving 
thrift seeks to reassure listeners in its radio ads that weve 
been in business over 70 years sale signs in suburban yards 
proclaim bankowned headlines in the real estate section 
scream repo 
some people cant get out of their homes some cant get into 
homes sellers have to swallow bigger losses because prices are 
depressed by the huge inventory of governmentowned homes hanging 
over the market buyers have trouble getting mortgages because 
money is tight qualifying is harder and rules are much stricter 
the sampl crisis says national association of home builders 
economist dean crist is hitting main street now 
in the mid1980s colorado springs exploded as a high tech high 
rollin military mecca that grew from 214000 residents in 1980 to 
about 300000 before the energy and defense booms went bust in the 
late 80s 
overbuilt and overappraised commercial and residential real 
estate prices dropped through the basement developers simply 
walked away from their debts so did homeowners caught in the 
squeeze between lost jobs and high mortgages their houses were 
repossessed by banks sampls or the federal government 
this year three sampls were taken over by government regulators 
two were sold one simply was shut down when no one offered to buy 
it and the repossessed properties settled into government hands 
today government agencies estimate they are offering for sale 
as many as 2200 singlefamily houses in the area thats almost 
half the 4620 singlefamily homes listed for sale by the pikes 
peak association of realtors multiplelisting service at the end of 
august 
steve barron a local realtor said the sampl crisis didnt cause 
the depressed market in colorado springs but it added to it 
what the sampls did was make money available for building on a 
speculative basis said barron they loaned money at 100 
percent rather than force a down payment all that overbuilding is 
what you see now 
the sampl crisis has lowered market values throughout the 
city said realtor cliff snyder 
barron views it as an opportunity for some people who were shut 
out of the housing market because of inflated prices during the 
1980s heyday 
the sampl collapse has created a window of opportunity for 
people who couldnt buy in back in 87 he said houses are as 
low now as theyre ever going to get this chance will never come 
again 
but the veteran realtor acknowledges that the sampl crisis 
coupled with a sluggish national economy and colorado springs 
overdevelopment has changed the way he and his colleagues approach 
clients 
the real estate community as a whole is much more cautious 
about the way they do business when they represent the seller 
they insist on a job history and a credit report on the buyer 
barron said 
heck in the 1980s if a buyer had a pulse he qualified now 
its gone to the other extreme he said 
were looking at a lot of retrenching its much tighter now 
much tougher to buy a home said charles grayson a banker in 
colorado springs 
judy and dave crenshaw can testify to that they had to go to 
three different mortgage companies and deal with two government 
agencies before they finally were able to buy a home here 
the government has tightened their belts so extremely that it 
has made it very difficult for people like us said mrs 
crenshaw we got caught in the squeeze 
the crenshaws lost out on one home because an appraisal fell 
more than 11000 short of the loan they were seeking that 
appraisal really did us in she said with disgust it was very 
stressful for us 
two months later they bought a new twostory home with a full 
basement for 80000 even that wasnt easy 
it took us three or four weeks longer to get the house than we 
expected and cost us more money because of the delay said mrs 
crenshaw a civil service employee at the fort carson army hospital 
the resolution trust corp the government agency established to 
sell properties acquired through failed sampls requires buyers in 
colorado springs to spend an extra 25 for credit counseling 
with such fierce competition in the marketplace barron said 
that extra fee might make the difference between selling an rtc 
home and one just like it down the block offered by a private 
buyer and financed by a mortgage lender who doesnt charge for 
advice 
were talking about buyers without a lot of disposable 
income said barron why should they have to pay 25 to rtc for 
something they can get free someplace else 
barron will not take his buyers to any sampl for financial 
assistance too unstable too many hassles too risky he said 
why add to the trauma and stress with a technically 
incompetent or unstable lender its a question of confidence will 
they still be there next week said barron i dont know 
anybody in my office using a savings and loan regularly today 
kerry wanner concurs 
word is spreading among brokers and agents said wanner a 
broker were bottomline people when you go to an sampl and you 
cant get the job done you dont go there anymore

television sound a pool is lined with motherofpearl tile 
fivefoottall rare porcelain vases stand guard at the entrance to 
a french restaurant employees stand in hallways just to answer any 
questions that might happen by 
to some the phoenician resort epitomizes excellence to others 
it is a monument to excess and extravagance paid for by the 
nowinsolvent lincoln savings amp loan 
but for anyone who spends a night there its hard to believe 
this 275 million desert oasis actually is a governmentowned and 
operated property 
if the governments running it theyre doing a wonderful job 
id say this is one of their more successful ventures frederick 
shaw a westfield nj physician said with a chuckle its the 
nicest resort ive ever stayed in 
club fed as it is called locally was seized by fbi agents 
last november after federal regulators took over lincoln from 
charles keating the phoenix developer blamed for one of the 
costliest of all sampl failures 
as if the phoenicians ownership wasnt troublesome enough 
iraqs invasion of kuwait created some figurative ripples through 
the seven swimming pools here too 
lincoln savings owned 55 percent of the resort the share now 
in the hands of the federal resolution trust corp the londonbased 
kuwait investment office owns the remaining 45 percent 
they assured us the investment is secure phoenician 
spokeswoman sally cooper said of the kuwaitis 
the us government continues to run the palmfilled oasis 
hiring an austrian hotelier to manage the 130acre resort until a 
buyer can be found 
no attempt has been made to sell the hotel because of pending 
litigation and the kuwaitis have the first right of refusal rtc 
spokesman kevin shields said 
the phoenician is one of the bestknown of all the thousands of 
properties now in the hands of the federal government acquired 
through failed sampls 
it became both a symbol of the sampl excess and a battleground 
for keating who claims sampl regulators didnt understand his 
business and conspired to ruin his deals 
regulators for their part claim keating looted lincoln 
savings using it as his own piggy bank to finance a lavish 
lifestyle for his family and build speculative white elephant 
projects like the resort which they say has lost millions since 
its october 1988 opening 
its very opulent and extravagant shields said this is 
not something sampls should go around building 
so heated is the feud between keating and regulators that when 
the government ousted keatings management of the phoenician fbi 
agents confiscated documents and changed the locks on the doors 
phoenician management now says the resort is breaking even on a 
cashflow basis but thats not a true picture the rtc says 
because the phoenicians balance sheet carries no debt lincoln 
footed the 275 million bill for building the resort 
the question is can it really make a profit shields said 
what price will we be able to sell it in order for the buyer to 
make it profitable 
while all the wrangling has gone on few if any reservations 
have been canceled because of the mess 
really all of this has not had any adverse effect if 
anything curiosity was piqued said ms cooper 
dennis beljan was curious he and his wife came from nearby 
mesa ariz for a golf holiday because i knew it was supposed to 
be a super property 
it exceeds some of the higher quality resorts in the area 
beljan said you dont feel any government presence at all

earlier reflecting the nations stagnant economy according to a 
survey released today 
in a survey of more than 15000 businesses by manpower inc 23 
percent said they plan to increase hiring activity in the fourth 
quarter of 1990 while 11 percent plan to reduce the size of their 
work force 
that is down from 26 percent and 9 percent respectively in the 
same 1989 period the figures also are below the 27 percent planned 
hiring and 8 percent planned staff reductions in this years third 
quarter 
manpower a temporary employment firm attributed the 
pessimistic hiring plans in large part to declining economic 
conditions in the northeast that began early last year 
manpower said its latest quarterly survey was conducted before 
the middle east crisis began manpower president mitchell fromstein 
said the callup of military reserves could alter hiring practices 
if it lasts an extended time jobs of activated reservists are 
guaranteed upon return 
construction industry hiring expectations were especially weak 
with 17 percent of firms planning additional hiring but 20 percent 
expecting employment declines manpower said that marked the first

alaska air group is flying solo with a 
secondround 47 percent fare increase to counter rising jetfuel 
prices a trendsetting move usually left to the industry giants 
alaska air seattlebased holding company for regional alaska 
airlines and its feeder airline horizon air industries announced 
last week the additional increase will take effect oct 1 
like nearly all domestic carriers it had announced a 53 
percent increase aug 30 prompted by fuel prices that have soared 
since iraq invaded oilrich kuwait on aug 2 
pan am corp one of the industry giants was the first to take 
the plunge with a secondround fare boost but its increase is 
smaller 44 percent 
the new yorkbased parent of pan american airways announced the 
additional increase for domestic service aug 31 one day after the 
firstround rise the increase which goes into effect sept 18 
will not affect international fares 
alaska air is taking a chance with its secondround jump 
its very out of character for alaska to take the lead in fare 
increases in national terms alaska air spokesman greg witter 
said friday 
were simply trying to get the ball rolling here he said 
noting alaska airs fuel bill has jumped 53 percent since late 
july from an average 64 cents a gallon to 98 cents by friday 
the initial increase simply wasnt big enough to cover costs he 
said 
alaska airlines which serves 37 cities in eight western states 
and mexico and horizon which flies to 34 cities in five pacific 
northwest states and british columbia are prepared to back off 
we will scuttle the fare increase if the competition doesnt 
follow suit witter said we refuse to put ourselves in a 
position where were noncompetitive 
rising fuel prices may not be the only issue for alaska air 
the carrier has been embroiled for months in reducedfare 
battles on the lucrative west coast corridor where it is one of 
the last regional carriers said industry analyst robert decker 
with the chicagobased duff amp phelps investment research firm 
alaskas fare increase may be related to farecutting as much 
as anything else and to get their fares up to economic levels 
decker said alaska airlines is really a niche player and 
getting fares back up is very important to them 
alaska airlines with a reputation for excellent passenger 
service and premium meals has about a 1 percent share of the 
overall domestic market it dominates air traffic between alaska 
and the lower 48 with a 52 percent share 
the industrys firstround increase was slow in coming and 
the 53 percent increase wasnt enough witter said 
several major carriers including american airlines and delta 
airlines delayed increases planned to counter rising fuel prices 
because some competitors refused to budge from preinvasion prices 
and even the 53 percent jump isnt expected to fully compensate 
airlines for the effects of the persian gulf crisis 
some airlines had considered 10 percent boosts but the industry 
finally settled on the smaller increase 
industry analyst bill whitlow with dain bosworth in seattle 
said alaska air needs the secondround increase to survive the 
soaring fuel prices 
larger carriers have the financial resources to swallow the 
losses if they prove to be shortterm whitlow said 
witter said alaska airs 101plane fleet alaska airlines 55 
jetliners and horizons 46 propeller planes burns about 18 
million gallons of fuel a month 
the fuelprice increases cost the carrier about 6 million in 
the first month after the invasion he said 
thats significant for a carrier with reported profits of 96 
million during the second quarter of 1990 and operating revenues of 
2633 million

chinas first pizza hut opened monday in beijing 
and served 200 pizzas to an invitationonly crowd of chinese and 
foreigners before running out of dough 
by midafternoon the restaurant was turning away guests 
we have to wait for the dough to rise so itll take about an 
hour one waitress said other waitresses said there would be a 
twohour wait 
henry foo general manager of beijing pizza corp ltd which 
operates the outlet said more guests turned up than expected 
in the future the twostory 180seat restaurant expects to 
serve about 285 pizzas daily mainly to foreign tourists and 
foreign residents of beijing most chinese have never eaten pizza 
and many dont like cheese which is alien to the chinese diet 
until now pizza has been available only in a few jointventure 
hotels in china which do not allow ordinary chinese free access 
but company chairman jiang tinzhi said the new pizza hut also 
hopes to attract chinese customers 
pizzas have been accepted by other asian communities and they 
will be accepted in china as well jiang said 
its terrific its delicious was the assessment of 
16yearold liu mei one of the first customers who said she had 
never eaten a pizza before 
but some chinese standing outside looking at the price said it 
was too expensive the cost of a pizza is the equivalent of about 
460 
thats almost one sixth of my monthly salary i have to save 
before i can bring my 3yearold son here to have a meal said 
one man 
beijing pizza corp ltd is a 1 million joint venture between 
the hong kongbased amit ltd which holds 60 percent and the

congressional leaders and 
white house negotiators raced the clock sunday trying to narrow 
their differences over the budget and reach an agreement for fiscal 
1991 
the two sides worked for a third straight day at andrews air 
force base in maryland 20 minutes from the capital spending much 
of their time discussing taxes lawmakers have said they want to 
finish work by monday to give congress time to enact a package of 
savings by the oct 1 start of the fiscal year 
there had been talk of a meeting at the white house monday 
morning but those tentative plans were scuttled as the bargainers 
broke for the night with still too much preliminary work to do when 
they resume talks monday president bush returned to washington 
late sunday after his helsinki summit meeting with soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev 
returning with bush aboard air force one white house chief of 
staff john sununu told reporters he had been told by administration 
budget director richard darman that not much progress has been 
made at the talks 
congress and the bush administration have been deadlocked all 
year over how to reduce the deficit 
the bargainers have been searching for a combination of new 
taxes and spending cuts producing 50 billion in savings for next 
year and 500 billion over the next five years inaction could mean 
a record 250 billion deficit next year 
democrats and republicans have clashed all year over how to 
achieve budget savings democrats have tried to emphasize defense 
reductions and new taxes while republicans have sought to pare 
domestic programs 
an official said the two sides were considering about 10 
billion in cuts in benefit programs such as medicare and aid to 
farmers when the talks began friday democrats offered reductions 
of 72 billion while republicans pressed for 155 billion 
republicans were hoping to limit cuts in the 303 billion 
defense budget to about 4 billion democrats after initially 
demanding about 15 billion in reductions eased their proposal by 
2 billion 
each side was seeking about 25 billion in new taxes and federal 
fees but their components varied 
democrats wanted to raise income taxes paid by the wealthy and 
impose new levies on energy gasoline alcoholic products and 
luxury items such as boats and jewelry 
republicans were pressing for new taxes on beer and wine 
eliminating some incometax deductions for the rich and cutting the 
capital gains tax rate 
the bargainers who had come to andrews to avoid distractions 
had their talks interrupted unexpectedly saturday night officials 
said 
the negotiations have been held in the bases officers club a 
sprawling building that has continued to be used for wedding 
receptions 
shortly after 10 pm saturday a fire alarm was set off 
supposedly by a musician who inadvertently hung a coat on it like 
everyone else in the building the bargainers had to evacuate that 
ended the negotiations for the evening

the number of working oil and gas rigs in the 
united states soared by 27 this week to 1039 an indication that 
the domestic oil patch finally is feeling the effects of the middle 
east crisis baker hughes inc reported today 
this is the second highest this year said ike kerridge who 
keeps track of the count for baker hughes its the highest since 
jan 2 when the count was 1042 
although the count traditionally increases this time of year 
kerridge said the jump was clearly larger than he expected 
i think this is the beginning of the reflection of the higher 
oil prices he said 
kerridge has said he expected it to take several weeks for the 
rig count to increase in response to rising oil prices 
last week the count increased by 10 to 1012 a year ago this 
week the count increased by 14 to 950 
baker hughes a houstonbased oil toolmaker company has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 the count the widely watched 
index of drilling activity represents the number of rigs actively 
exploring for oil not those producing oil 
at the height of the oil boom in december 1981 the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but the rig count plunged to a low of 663 
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986 
texas was the big winner this week with its count climbing by 
11 among other major oilproducing states new mexicos count was 
up five colorado was up by four and louisiana gained three rigs 
wyoming oklahoma and michigan each gained two more rigs while 
ohios count was up by one 
the only state to lose this week was california where the rig 
count was down by 12

president saddam hussein of iraq today 
offered to provide third world countries with oil free of charge in 
what he described as a gesture of solidarity 
but the iraqi leader did not say how the oil would be 
transported a unordered embargo bans trade with iraq 
we hereby declare that we are prepared to supply all third 
world countries with oil free of charge in accordance with the 
needs of each country saddam said in his latest televised 
message 
the statement was read by a broadcaster on iraqi state radio and 
television monitored in nicosia via satellite and translated from 
the arabic by the associated press 
saddam addressed his message to third world governments but did 
not specify the countries he said he was making the offer 
regardless of the various governments stands in the persian gulf 
crisis 
the initiative is in appreciation for your evenhanded policies 
toward arab causes the foremost of which is the palestinian 
cause saddam said 
we are brothers to you we share the same destiny he told 
the third world countries 
saddam said that since iraq would not be able to transport the 
oil because of the un embargo the countries who want the oil 
should arrange transport themselves 
he claimed his offer should not violate the un embargo 
because no buying or selling was involved the embargo was imposed 
shortly after iraq invaded kuwait aug 2

grain and soybean futures prices fell moderately 
this morning on the chicago board of trade reflecting a lack of 
significant new export demand and perceptions that the corn and 
soybean crops are improving 
sharp early declines in the energy and precious metal markets 
also contributed to weakness in the crop markets said walter 
spilka a grains analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co in 
new york 
the soybean complex led todays early retreat amid 
disappointment that the bush administration did not announce plans 
to grant agricultural export credits to the soviet union analysts 
said 
good rainfall over the weekend in the mississippi delta region 
also weighed on the soybean market while forecasts for the midwest 
predicted mild conditions as the corn harvest nears 
sunshine and warm mild temperatures is all they need 
spilka said of both the corn and soybean crops 
it seems like were heading toward a perfect finish here if we 
dont get an early frost 
prices also were pressured by expectations that the government 
will increase its corn and soybean harvest estimates in a crop 
report due out on wednesday 
in early trading wheat futures were 1 cents to 2 cents lower 
with the contract for delivery in september at 261 a bushel 
corn futures were 1 cents to 3 cents lower with september at 
236 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 2 cents lower with september 
bid at 106 a bushel soybeans were 1 cents to 6 cents lower 
with september at 607 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures were higher in early trading on the 
chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 10 cent to 20 cent higher with october at

congressional leaders and 
administration officials say they still have a wide gulf between 
them after three days of intensive talks that have yet to produce a 
deficitcutting deal for next year 
the two sides began a fourth day of bargaining today at andrews 
air force base 20 minutes from washington one official speaking 
on condition of anonymity said there was still no movement 
toward completing a pact 
white house and democratic bargainers said they were frustrated 
the talks have not progressed further 
i would say the talks are going nowhere fast treasury 
secretary nicholas brady said today on abcs good morning 
america im not heartened by progress in the talks its 
disappointing 
brady said he doubted the negotiations would achieve agreement 
in time to avoid mandatory budget reductions in most federal 
programs at the start of the fiscal year on oct 1 
im optimistic that well get a deal at some point im not 
optimistic that these particular talks will produce it in time 
brady said 
the chief democratic negotiator house majority leader richard 
gephardt dmo had tentatively planned to discuss the standoff 
with president bush at the white house today 
but brady denied a meeting was planned 
i cant see the purpose of a white house meeting he said 
sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the session was 
canceled because so much work remained instead they said 
bargaining would continue today and perhaps tuesday as well 
white house chief of staff john sununu returning from finland 
with bush aboard air force one told reporters late sunday that he 
had learned that not much progress has been made at the budget 
talks 
asked about that remark one democratic participant said i 
think thats a fair description 
the bargainers goal has been to shake hands on a packagesaving 
50 billion next year and 500 billion over the next five years 
many had said they wanted to complete their bargaining by today to 
give congress time to enact the plan by oct 1 the start of the 
new fiscal year 
but participants said they still had much work to do they spent 
much of sunday discussing taxes and benefit programs 
both sides are seeking about 25 billion in new taxes and fees 
democrats have proposed raising income tax rates for the wealthy 
and placing new levies on energy gasoline alcohol and luxury 
items such as furs and private planes 
republicans have suggested reducing the capital gains tax rate 
which they say will raise money limiting the deductibility of 
state and local income taxes and boosting alcohol levies 
a major gulf remained over pentagon spending democrats wanted 
to slash bushs 303 billion defense request by 15 billion while 
republicans wanted to limit the reduction to 4 billion officials 
said each side had eased its position somewhat but that 
disagreement remained 
republicans began the talks seeking deeper cuts than democrats 
in benefit programs such as medicare by sunday the two sides were 
considering about 10 billion in reductions in those programs 
about midway between their opening positions 
the negotiators met at the air force base officers club 
keeping reporters confined to a press center about two miles away 
their justification for the unusual site of the sessions 
eliminating distractions was shattered saturday evening when a 
fire alarm clanged in the building at about 10 oclock 
officials said a musician at a wedding reception being held 
elsewhere in the club accidentally placed a coat on the alarm the 
bargaining recessed for the evening

the dough is rising the tomato sauce is simmering 
and deep pans are being oiled at pizza huts first two soviet 
restaurants which are set to open tuesday in moscow 
after three years of negotiations and seven months of 
construction 300 young workers are ready to serve up 
americanstyle pizza garlic bread salad and apple pies for both 
dollars and rubles 
the opening comes one day after pizza huts first restaurant 
opened in beijing the beijing restaurant served 200 pizzas to an 
invitationonly crowd of chinese and foreigners before running out 
of dough by midafternoon it was turning away disappointed people 
pepsico inc which owns pizza hut says the invitation to set 
up business in moscow was initiated by the former soviet ambassador 
to the united states anatoly dobrinyn who frequently ate with his 
family at pizza hut in washington dc 
the restaurants are technically owned by moscow pizza a 10 
million joint venture between moscows restaurant department and 
pepsicos european branch 
the soviet workers were selected from more than 3000 applicants 
and received weeks of training here and in london in more than just 
the cooking and serving of pizza andy rafalet regional operations 
director said they had to learn to smile not snarl like many 
soviet restaurant workers and recognize the body language of 
hungry or impatient customers 
similar training was given when mcdonalds introduced fast food 
to the soviet union eight months ago 
one of the new pizzerias is on gorky street a main thoroughfare 
minutes from the kremlin it seats 120 people and features a 
takeout window selling slices of pizza for rubles only 
the bigger of the two restaurants near a large foreigners 
compound on kutuzovsky prospekt will have a takeout service and 
separate dining rooms for ruble and dollarpaying customers 
the decor is like any other pizza hut down to the redandwhite 
checked tabletops red chrome chairs fake tropical plants and red 
roof logo but in a concession to the long soviet winters dozens 
of brass coatracks have been installed to accommodate bulky coats 
scarves and hats 
a special moscow pizza topped with salmon smoked sardines and 
onions has been added to a menu listing only nine combinations no 
substitutions are allowed soviets are not accustomed to large 
menus because most restaurants here offer limited choices and many 
of those are unavailable on any given day 
the salad bars in the moscow pizza huts are short on lettuce and 
heavy on the coleslaw the coffee hasnt arrived yet and the 
kutuzovsky restaurant ran out of pepsi one hour into a preopening 
press bash 
but moscows communist party youth newspaper had a sneak preview 
and gave it the thumbs up the first thing you are treated to is 
a smile and at once you start feeling easy and at home 
in less than a minute a pretty waitress came up to us and 
smiled moskovskaya komsomolets said she asked us what we 
would like to order but we looked blank salivating and asking her 
what each dish she mentioned was 
pizza hut has imported basic supplies but is relying on local 
flour and vegetables it commissioned its own beer from a local 
brewery and is involved in a soviet joint venture to make 
mozzarella cheese 
pizza hut says the four ovens in its bigger restaurant can 
produce 5000 pizzas daily and it expects to serve 50000 
customers a week about seven times the turnover of any pizza hut 
in the united states mcdonalds moscow outlet still sells 5000 
burgers an hour and the lunchtime lineup is 90 minutes long 
the restaurants are part of a 3 billion trade pact in which the 
soviet union will build at least 10 ships mostly oil tankers to 
be sold or leased by pepsico in return for foreign credits 
the twostory 180seat beijing restaurant expects to serve 
about 285 pizzas daily mainly to foreign tourists and foreign 
residents of beijing 
for some chinese the 460 price of a pizza was enough to turn 
them away from mondays grand opening thats almost onesixth of 
my salary i have to save before i can bring my 3yearold son here 
to have a meal said one man outside

soybean futures prices closed moderately higher 
monday on the chicago board of trade rebounding sharply from the 
days lows after a private meteorologist forecast a freeze this 
weekend in the midwest 
wheat futures also advanced while corn futures were narrowly 
mixed and oats retreated 
freezing temperatures would pose a greater threat to the still 
maturing soybean crop than to the corn crop which is nearly ready 
for harvest 
sources on the trading floor said central weather service an 
illinoisbased forecasting firm headed by earl finckle predicted 
temperatures would drop below 32 degrees during the weekend as far 
south as the northern edges of iowa illinois indiana and ohio 
finckle would not confirm the reports saying his firm provided 
commodity weather forecasts only to its subscribers 
the crop markets opened lower led by the soybean complex amid 
disappointment that the bush administration announced no grain 
export credits to the soviet union after sundays summit meeting 
at the close wheat futures were 3 cents to 5 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in september at 267 a bushel corn was 
cent lower to 1 cents higher with september at 240 a bushel 
oats were 1 cents to 1 cents lower with september at 107 a

the middle east crisis finally has made its way 
to the domestic oil patch according to a widely watched index of 
drilling activity reported monday 
the rig count the number of working oil and natural gas rigs 
in the united states soared by 27 this week to 1039 the second 
highest total this year baker hughes inc 
i think this is the beginning of the reflection of the higher 
oil prices said ike kerridge a vice president at 
houstonbased baker hughes an oil toolmaker that has tracked the 
count since 1940 
this is up more than i would have expected for the seasonal 
pattern i probably would have expected an increase of about 12 
kerridge said the same week last year the count rose 14 to 950 
the count reflects the number of rotary rigs exploring for oil 
or gas it has shown some gains since iraqs invasion of kuwait 
last month and the resulting boost in oil prices last week the 
count increased by 10 to 1012 
but until monday kerridge had attributed most of improvement to 
traditional seasonal increases the oil patch has been suspicious 
of the persian gulf crisis and some drilling companies stung by 
the oil bust in the 1980s have been hesitant about adding dollars 
for oil exploration fearing any price increase is only temporary 
at the height of the oil boom in december 1981 the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices tumbled and the rig count 
followed hitting a low of 663 in the summer of 1986 
some of us remember the pain we had to go through in 1986 
said don covey president of the exploration and production 
division of mitchell energy amp development corp an independent oil 
company near houston we dont want to get caught in that trap 
again 
but rising oil prices have had some positive impact on 
mitchells drilling plans covey said the additional revenue from 
production has allowed mitchell to finance two drilling projects on 
its own rather than with a partner as previously planned 
i think youve got to be cautious covey said its only 
one week 
kerridge said some of the delay in higher rig counts can also be 
attributed to the amount of time it takes to gather the permits 
contracts equipment and crews for a new drilling project 
some may have started the process immediately but i think 
some probably waited to see if price increases were just a 
temporary spike he said 
whether increases in the rig count are higher than normal the 
rest of the year will depend on what happens to oil prices 
kerridge said 
if people think this is temporary i dont think youll see a 
prolonged increase he said 
if higher oil prices persist covey said his company probably 
will have more money budgeted next year for drilling 
if drilling continues to increase some industry executives 
believe there may be problems in restoring rigs that have sat idle 
during the downturn in the oil industry 
there are a lot of rigs mothballed covey said adding he 
doesnt know how many can be put back into operation easily 
but dale steffes an independent oil analyst in houston 
disagrees 
if the money is there the people and the rigs will be right 
there behind it steffes said in 1981 we added 1000 rigs to 
the fleet 
steffes said he expects the rig count to show 
betterthanaverage gains because he believes oil prices will 
remain in the upper 20s per barrel for the rest of the year 
so the producers will have extra cash flow a lot of the 
majors oil companies will not be as quick to put it back in 
drilling steffes said but the independents the minute they 
get their bank notes caught up theyre going to pump the extra 
back into drilling thats their nature you give them some extra 
money and thats what theyre going to do 
according to mondays rig count texas was the big winner this 
week with its count climbing by 11 among other major 
oilproducing states new mexicos count was up five colorado was 
up by four and louisiana gained three rigs 
wyoming oklahoma and michigan each gained two more rigs while 
ohios count was up by one 
the only state to lose this week was california where the rig 
count was down by 12

creditors and asking for release of private financial information 
a spokesman said monday 
richard ravitch a partner of the new yorkbased blackstone 
group said the firm is contacting greyhounds creditors one at a 
time to ask their help in obtaining information needed for a 
buyout offer 
we dont have access to the data confidential information 
about the company and we wont have unless the creditor can ask 
the company to release it ravitch said 
he and members of the striking bus drivers union met sunday in 
washington to discuss a possible buyout offer which ravitch said 
could include partial employee ownership 
greyhound has until oct 2 to exclusively present to creditors 
its reorganization plan under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 
its in creditors best interest to have another proposal 
than the one theyre going to get from the company ravitch said 
greyhound spokesman george gravley said the company is forging a 
reorganization plan and expects to present it in november if the 
federal bankruptcy court allows an extension 
the plan does not include sale of the company gravley said 
if the companys plan is approved by creditors greyhound expects 
to emerge from chapter 11 by mid1991 
the striking amalgamated transit union has tried to gain control 
of greyhound from chairman fred currey who led a 1987 leveraged 
buyout of greyhound a unit of gli holding inc greyhound filed for 
chapter 11 reorganization in june citing costs incurred by the 
drivers strike that began in march 
union local presidents and other labor officials met sunday in 
washington with the general partner of blackstone which has an 
800 million investment fund 
mr ravitch came before the council to indicate that he 
continued to be interested in buying the company and in doing that 
under terms that would bring about an end to the labor dispute with 
the union said earle putnam the unions general counsel 
ravitch also said he was hoping to be able to get more 
information from the company about his financial condition and its 
operating condition that would enable him to put a value on the 
company and understand what would be required to restore it to full

putnam said blackstone would deal with union at arms 
length he said a buyout would result in new collective 
bargaining agreement 
as far as partial workerownership putnam said the most the 
union would have would be a minority stock interest that would be 
created through a profitsharing plan 
its never been our intention to own the company in the terms 
of putting in cash or dominating the board or management he said 
also figuring in the companys future is a pivotal trial before 
the national labor relations board on alleged unfair labor 
practices brought against greyhound in milwaukee the trial set 
for this month was rescheduled to november

against the company by the union should the milwaukee complaint be 
upheld greyhound could be forced to rehire striking drivers and 
give them millions of dollars in back pay 
the drivers union had considered its own buyout offer before 
the company filed bankruptcy negotiating with a new jersey 
investment firm to represent the atu however no offer was made 
nor were any meetings held

the foxboro co a multimilliondollar company 
recently bought by a british firm announced monday it would lay 
off 1600 employees worldwide as part of a restructuring 
while the path we have chosen is ambitious and initially 
painful especially for the people directly impacted the results 
of these actions will be improved prosperity and growth said e 
barrie stephens chairman of siebe plc 
siebe is a private manufacturer of electrical equipment 
headquartered in windsor england it purchased foxboro three 
months ago for 6564 million or 52 a share 
the firm now controls 98 percent of foxboro stock and has made 
arrangements to buy the final 2 percent of the foxboro massbased 
company 
the british company said it would be laying off 1600 people 
over the next two quarters from foxboro which makes process 
control instruments and systems 
john c fuller a spokesman for foxboro said about 800 of the 
layoffs will be from four plants in massachusetts and the rest 
from its european facilities 
fuller said siebe was streamlining foxboro and planned to 
restructure the company by increasing its global market and 
improving its manufacturing abilities and technology 
i dont think any of it is directly related to how much 
siebe paid or didnt pay i think it is related to restoring the 
profitability level fuller said 
he said foxboro had not made money in three of the last five 
years this is looked more on as refocusing primarily on 
financial operations and sales and customer service and engineering 
operations he said in other words focusing on the core of 
the business 
siebe completed the purchase of the company a week ago on 
friday gary k willis president and chief executive officer of 
foxboro was fired and 300 employees at a plant in foxboro were 
laid off fuller said the layoffs were across the board with few 
departments remaining untouched 
willis whose firing was not announced until monday was not 
removed as part of the streamlining and will be replaced soon 
fuller said 
i think the cutbacks over the past few years indicated the 
buck stops somewhere and someone had to take responsibility for 
it fuller said of willis 
he said the restructuring was expected to take six months to 
complete 
stephens said in a written statement the new headquarters for 
foxboro europe will be based in germany and will be the center of 
its sales and service organizations in the united kingdom france 
italy and the netherlands

the soviet union seeking to make oil production 
its top foreign currency earner has asked for a second meeting 
with visiting heads of american energy firms us commerce 
secretary robert mosbacher said monday 
mosbacher is leading a delegation of 15 chief executives to the 
soviet union which at moscows request includes the heads of seven 
energy companies on monday they met with foreign economic 
relations minister konstantin katushev before having pizza and beer 
at one of two pizza hut restaurants to open tuesday 
minister katushev particularly asked that there be another 
meeting with the energy people to expedite the energy opportunities 
and developments in exploration and refining and other things that 
might be pursued and moved faster mosbacher told a news 
conference 
with oil at a higher prices and their flow of oil decreasing 
theyre very anxious to build up their production as the no 1 
source of hard currency for them 
the soviet unions antiquated and longmismanaged oil industry 
produced about 121 billion barrels of oil a day last year 
onesixth of the worlds total 
it exported 37 million barrels a day about half of it to the 
west oil analysts estimated that netted the soviets 20 billion 
about 40 percent of its badly needed hard currency 
mosbachers delegation includes chief executives of atlantic 
richfield co chevron corp pruet oil co texaco inc archer 
daniels midland co dresser industries inc and the louisiana 
land and exploration co 
mosbacher said mondays talks about extending american knowhow 
in the energy agricultural and homebuilding industries were 
general but under the right conditions i think they could move 
from there to concrete actions actually being accomplished quite 
quickly 
he said the us administration is looking at increasing the 
level of permitted technology transfers to the soviet union 
always precluding at this point that technology which could be 
used directly militarily 
the technology that is being sent to the soviet union is of a 
higher nature than it has been and we are examining and 
reexamining the possibility of even raising the level further 
he said 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said in a television 
interview sunday night that he discussed increased technology 
transfers during his helsinki summit with president bush 
today we mine our natural resources but we dont use them 
effectively enough and they the united states have the 
techonology and they proposed and named something in order to 
secure the better use of our raw materials and protect the 
environment gorbachev said 
he said bush also promised to remove all obstacles preventing 
the soviet union and the united states from jointly developing a 
new civilian aircraft 
its a very big business deal on a big scale he said 
the bush administration said last week it would take a fresh 
look at economic aid to the soviet union in light of moscows 
support and cooperation in trying to resolve the persian gulf 
crisis 
but it said it remains hamstrung by the jacksonvanik amendment 
enacted to punish the soviets for preventing free emigration the 
amendment also prevents the soviets from obtaining 
mostfavorednation trading status 
so the economic help were talking about is the private sector 
coming in and investing and helping develop and helping train 
mosbacher said 
the soviet union introduced legislation last year lifting most 
travel restrictions on its citizens but the measures have not yet 
been passed 
we hope theyll move quickly now mosbacher said if they 
dont well have to reexamine it but at this point there are no 
plans in the short term to do that

precious metal futures prices tumbled monday reflecting a 
stronger dollar and pronounced weakness in the oil market for most 
of the day 
oil prices staged an abrupt reversal late in the session after 
the metal markets closed and ended with sharp gains 
on other commodity markets copper futures sank grains and 
soybeans were mixed and livestock and meat futures advanced 
on new yorks commodity exchange gold futures settled 1090 to 
1260 lower with the contract for delivery in september down 
1090 at 37860 a troy ounce silver finished 45 cents to 52 
cents lower with september at 4755 a troy ounce 
platinum futures ended 2430 to 2480 lower on the new york 
mercantile exchange with september at 45540 a troy ounce 
light sweet crude oil for october delivery opened at 2855 a 
barrel on the new york merc down nearly 150 from fridays 
settlement the opening drop largely reflected perceptions that the 
joint ussoviet condemnation of iraqi hostility in the persian 
gulf region had further reduced the likelihood of an allout middle 
east war said peter cardillo commodity trading adviser with 
jesup josephthal amp co in new york 
gasoline and heating oil futures also opened sharply lower in 
new york which eased inflation fears and reduced investor interest 
in gold as an inflation hedge analysts said 
precious metals also were pressed by the stronger dollar and by 
heavy trade selling of platinum which scraped the bottom of its 
25anounce daily price limit at one point 
bette raptopoulos metals analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc said the biggest factor in the precious metals 
decline was a perception that the persian gulf standoff will not 
lead to a shooting war 
thats todays perception she said tomorrows perception 
may change and i suspect it will 
analysts were at a loss to explain the oil markets sudden 
rebound which occurred very late in the session after trading in 
the precious metals had ceased 
stephen platt of dean witter reynolds inc said some players 
fear the resumption of diplomatic relations between iraq and its 
former enemy iran may signal the beginning of a military alliance 
cardillo said oils rally was inspired by crudes failure to 
fall very far below its opening level 
light sweet crude oil settled 91 cents to 126 higher with 
october at 3130 a barrel heating oil was 148 cents to 263 
cents higher with october at 8589 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 74 cent to 196 cents higher with october at 9456 
cents a gallon 
copper futures followed gold and silver lower on the commodity 
exchange copper gave back more than a quarter of fridays gains 
which had pushed the market to its highest level in nearly a year 
copper settled 165 cents to 295 cents higher with september at 
1338 a pound 
soybean futures rose moderately on the chicago board of trade 
after a private meteorologist forecast a freeze this weekend in the 
midwest 
wheat futures also advanced while corn futures were narrowly 
mixed and oats retreated 
a weekly agriculture department report released after the close 
showed 17 percent of the corn crop mature as of sunday and 11 
percent of the soybean crop dropping leaves 
the crops remained well behind the normal pace due to late 
plantings 
wheat futures settled 3 cents to 5 cents higher with september 
at 267 a bushel corn was cent lower to cent higher with 
september at 239 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 1 cents lower 
with september at 107 a bushel soybeans were 3 cents to 7 
cents higher with september at 619 a bushel 
stronger cash markets supported livestock and meat futures on 
the chicago mercantile exchange

the dollar rose against most major currencies 
monday but it was the japanese yen that dominated foreign exchange 
trading 
gold prices fell sharply in new york as traders perceived an 
easing of the crisis in the middle east after the weekend summit 
between president bush and soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
analysts said the yen which fell sharply in recent weeks as 
tensions continued in the persian gulf regained strength following 
the bank of japans decision aug 30 to raise its discount rate 
a recovery on the tokyo stock exchange has raised interest in 
japanese investments and traders who had placed their money into 
currencies such as the british pound recently were now turning to 
the yen said james t mcgroarty a senior vice president with 
greenwich capital markets inc 
investors also believed that interest rates in britain which 
have supported the pound would begin to decline from their current 
high levels mcgroarty said such a development would make sterling 
a less attractive investment 
the dollar was higher against all major currencies except the 
yen monday but its more of an individual currency assessment 
rather than an overall dollar view mcgroarty said 
in new york the dollar fell to 13952 yen from late fridays 
14010 in tokyo overnight the dollar fell to a closing 13943 
japanese yen from 14025 friday and in london it fell to 13920 
yen 
the pound fell sharply against the dollar closing at 18580 in 
new york compared with late fridays 18930 in london earlier 
sterling fell to 18565 from 18933 dollars late friday 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with late fridays 
prices included 15820 german marks up from 15680 13175 swiss 
francs up from 13055 53005 french francs up from 52530 
118000 italian lire up from 117050 and 116675 canadian 
dollars up from 116335 
other late dollar rates in europe compared with late fridays 
levels included 15808 german marks up from 15665 13197 swiss 
francs up from 13055 52985 french francs up from 52465 
17822 dutch guilders up from 17653 118050 italian lire up 
from 116850 and 11703 canadian dollars up from 11633 
in gold dealings analysts said the weekend summit meeting 
heartened new york traders gold is seen as a hedge during times of 
political uncertainty so the metal fell as the markets felt 
reassured 
david ryan chief trader and vice president for bullion trading 
at dean witter said gold prices continued to fall as they reached 
several technical support levels monday 
on the commodity exchange gold for september fell 1090 to 
37860 a troy ounce republic national bank later quoted a bid of 
37990 down 1010 
gold fell by smaller amounts overseas in london it slipped to 
a late bid of 38475 a troy ounce from 38675 late friday and in

earlier in hong kong gold fell 345 an ounce to close at 
38456

oil prices shot up monday in a late rally fueled 
by rumors of hostilities in the persian gulf after falling in the 
morning on the belief that the bushgorbachev summit made mideast 
war less imminent 
this is such a strange market said stephen smith an 
analyst with bear stearns amp co youre down a dollar and a half 
and then youre up a dollar and a half 
light sweet crude closed up 126 at 3130 per barrel for 
october contracts in light trading on the new york mercantile 
exchange 
oil had opened down 149 as traders were calmed by the weekend 
summit in helsinki finland president bush and soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev agreed that iraq should get out of kuwait but 
gorbachev indicated an unwillingness to resort to a military 
solution to the crisis 
crude fell another 20 cents before beginning a steady climb in 
all contract months 
unleaded gasoline and home heating oil also fell in the morning 
and rose across the board in the afternoon 
on october contracts gasoline closed up 150 cents at 9456 
cents per gallon while home heating oil closed up 191 cents at 
8589 cents per gallon 
natural gas futures were mixed 
the swings in oil prices sent stocks moving in opposite 
directions the stock market opened higher and closed lower the 
dow jones average of 30 industrials up about 30 points at its peak 
of the day finished with a 396 loss at 261559 
after oil opened with its sharp decline the price began 
rebounding on news that iraq and iran were reestablishing 
diplomatic ties for the first time since their extended war of the 
1980s the conciliatory move was viewed as a bid by iraq to try 
busting the international embargo of its oil that was put in place 
after it invaded kuwait on aug 2 
the markets paid brief attention to iraqi president saddam 
husseins announcement that he would provide free oil to third 
world countries as a gesture of good will but saddam said the 
recipients would have to pick up the oil themselves which would 
force them to get past the us navy 
when he came out with his statements they were construed as 
bearish said ed kevelson a trader with dean witter reynolds 
inc initially he came out with free oil so people said 
sell it then they started thinking you had to transport it that 
was pretty much discounted throughout the day as hussein 
gibberish 
the late afternoon rally was spurred by rumors that did not turn 
out to be valid according to annlouise hittle a senior oil 
analyst with shearson lehman brothers inc 
some people were trading on a rumor that iraq had moved troops 
into jordan hittle said another rumor was some saudi rigs 
were hit another one was some shots were fired 
officials in washington said there was no information to confirm 
any of the rumors

a shortage of cash could threaten the 
international cocoa organization work program proposed monday by 
its chairman officials from producing and consuming countries said 
in presenting his program west germanys peter baron 
acknowledged the possible cash shortage by saying the organization 
could sell off some of its stockpiled cocoa to finance it 
barons proposal calls for the 41nation cocoa organization to 
concentrate over the next two years on research and development in 
cocoa improving quality and promoting consumption 
these tasks would give the organization a new role now that its 
old market regulatory powers conferred by the international cocoa 
agreement have been officially suspended he said 
members of the organization agreed in march to extend the 
international cocoa agreement for two years from oct 1 but with a 
suspension during this period of its powers to intervene in the 
market to regulate supplies and prices 
the cocoa organization is short of cash because its producing 
member countries owe just over 153 million raised from a levy 
charged on internationally traded cocoa the ivory coast the 
worlds largest producer is the biggest debtor owing 87 million 
the levy of 30 per ton the organizations only source of 
direct funding was abolished in april 
according to official calculations the organization expects to 
have 22 million in hand oct 1 but will face ordinary 
administrative expenses over the next two years of up to 30 
million 
the bulk of the cash is required to finance its stockpile of 
250000 tons of cocoa 
member governments agreed in march that if producers did not pay 
their debts a limited amount of stockpiled cocoa could be sold to 
prevent the organization going into the red in 19901992 
probably no more than 20000 tons would have to be sold to fill 
any gap in the budget and that would be too small an amount to 
destabilize the market traders said 
baron said no more than 2000 to 3000 tons would have to be 
sold to finance his proposed work program 
cocoa is currently priced at around 1250 a ton on the world 
market 
producers and consumers are meeting separately to consider 
barons plan 
a decision on whether to endorse it is not expected until 
friday the final day of the cocoa organization talks here
