thugs at the polling stations hundreds had died during the 
campaign in political violence

democratic elections the first in the countrys 186yearold 
history more than 400 observers including former president jimmy 
carter and about 60 unarmed un military advisers were to monitor 
the balloting 
haiti is the first un member to ask the world body to observe 
balloting 
the country has been rocked by violence and political turmoil 
since the fall of presidentforlife jeanclaude duvalier his 
flight into exile in france in 1986 ended 29 years of duvalier 
family dictatorship that began with his late father francois papa 
doc duvalier in 1957 
the interim government of president ertha pascal trouillot 
appointed in march is the fifth since duvaliers fall 
an ardent critic of duvalier while he was in power aristide has 
many enemies in hardline duvalierist circles 
he reluctantly became a candidate at the prompting of a 
centerleft organization which sought to offset the candidacy of 
roger lafontant reputed head of the tonton macoutes the feared 
secret militia of the duvaliers 
lafontant came back from exile in july to run for president the 
electoral council disqualified him for technical reasons but he 
vowed at the time to fight the decision 
a former salesian priest aristide was expelled from the 
conservative roman catholic order in december 1988 for allegedly 
fomenting revolution 
three months earlier hoodlums backed by the army stormed into 
his saint jean bosco church and killed at least 12 parishioners 
aristide was shielded by his flock and unharmed 
his critics accuse aristide of demagoguery they say his 
presidency is based on emotional appeal and would pose the threat 
of a theocratic dictatorship 
many haitiians had feared aristides candidacy would provoke new 
violence

the palestine liberation organization on 
wednesday urged the security council to send un staff to the 
israeloccupied territories to help protect palestinians 
the united states however could veto any resolution calling 
for deployment of un personnel appointment of an ombudsman or 
convening of an international human rights convention to help the 
palestinians 
negotiations were continuing in efforts to devise a draft 
resolution that could be adopted by consensus or avert a us veto 
in defense of its israeli ally 
the british broadcasting corp reported the united states has 
proposed that the security council consider convening a broad 
middle east peace conference 
the idea was discussed at a meeting of the five permanent 
members of the council who agreed to it said the bbc attributing 
its report to unidentified diplomatic sources 
the new york times reported in thursdays editions th united 
states would not oppose a call for an international middle east 
peace conference to settle the palestinian question in a resolution 
criticizing israels treatment of arabs in the territories 
us representative thomas pickering denied at midday wednesday 
that washington was making any proposal on the palestinian issue 
state dept spokesman david denny said later he was aware of the 
bbc report but had no comment 
soviet ambassador yuli vorontsov told reporters he did not 
expect a us veto but declined to discuss details of a possible 
consensus resolution the council was to meet against thursday and 
could vote on a resolution on protecting palestinians 
i dont think there should be any question of a veto because 
we are working differently now on a consensus basis and thats 
a sign of the times 
after more than three months of close cooperation and consensus 
he said the council now is not interested in scoring points or 
in passing resolutions that will be vetoed by the other members 
the soviet envoy commented after informal consultations among 
the five permanent members including the united states britain 
china and france he said the council was not interested in the 
resolutions we are interested in solutions 
earlier farouk kaddoumi the plo foreign affairs spokesman told 
the security council that it had a moral obligation to protect 
palestinians from what he called israeli crimes like the shooting 
deaths of at least 19 palestinians on temple mount on oct 8 
he told the 15member council that the united nations should do 
no less for palestinians under israeli occupation than it has done 
for kuwaitis under iraqi occupation 
we call upon your august council to establish a permanent 
presence of the united nations and its personnel in the occupied 
palestinian territories in the context of an established 
mechanism based on monitoring the situation and submitting 
periodic reports 
his speech was delivered as the council continued an 
intermittent monthlong debate about how to help safeguard the 
rights of palestinians in the israeli held territories 
he also blamed the united states for protecting israel and its 
criminal practices he said that the contradiction between 
council actions in the case of kuwaitis under occupation and its 
inaction in the case of palestinians has come to jeopardize its 
credibility and prestige and to cast doubt on its potential to play 
its required role in our new world 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar told reporters 
wednesday that he intends to send his special envoy jeanclaude 
aime to israel to discuss the palestinian problem after the 
council concludes its debate this week 
several draft resolutions currently are in circulation and 
united states is meeting with various council members in an effort 
to find an acceptable resolution 
plo officials said if there is no agreement then they will push 
for a vote thursday on a tough resolution sponsored by colombia 
cuba malaysia and yemen 
that resolution calls for the council to appoint an ombudsman to 
the territories to monitor and observe the situation with the 
help of the un personnel stationed there and to report on it to 
the secretarygeneral and the security council

president turgut ozal often praised by 
president bush as a loyal ally for his strong support in the 
persian gulf crisis is on slippery ground at home 
the 63yearold president is increasingly isolated has little 
public support and often faces criticism from establishment groups 
and members of his own motherland party 
the resignation of the chief of staff on monday indicated ozal 
also had alienated the military as well the most powerful 
establishment group in turkey 
gen necip torumtay who was succeeded tuesday by gen dogan 
gures stepped down not so much over a specific issue but to 
protest a style of government sources close to the military said 
since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 ozal has run a oneman show 
concerning turkeys gulf policy often bypassing cabinet members 
and the foreign ministry 
a few days after the invasion for example reporters told the 
foreign minister that pipelines carrying iraqi crude oil through 
turkey were being closed to comply with a un trade embargo 
in october foreign minister ali bozer resigned defense 
minister safa giray quit the next month 
some observers fear ozal may lead turkey into a middle east war 
who else but bush still supports ozals style of government 
asked columnist turker alkan in the daily gunes could a nation 
of 50 million be pushed into war behind the united states just 
because ozal wants it when everyone from 15yearolds to the chief 
of staff is opposed to war 
ozal was elected prime minister in 1983 when the military turned 
over power to civilians in general elections he won reelection in 
1987 but his party was badly beaten two years later 
the parliament where the motherland party enjoys a large 
majority elected him president his term runs until 1995 that 
year ozal moved to cankaya palace turning over the prime 
ministers job to a loyal follower yildirim akbulut 
opposition politicians say ozal is running the government even 
though the presidency is supposed to be a mainly ceremonial post 
they hope to win enough votes in the next elections to change the 
constitution and unseat him 
ozal is also opposed by organized labor at a meeting tuesday to 
discuss productivity labor representatives marched out in protest 
when ozal entered the hall nationwide 48000 miners are on strike 
to protest the governments insistence on low wages 
businessmen once ozals allies and supporters of his free 
market policies now grumble about what they say is widespread 
corruption in government and the lack of a coordinated economic 
policy 
the educated elite and other secularist turks meanwhile are 
demanding an end to government policies and hiring practices deemed 
favorable to islamic fundamentalists their discontent is shared by 
the traditionally secular military 
in a farewell message to turkeys 800000strong armed forces 
torumtay said the road shown by ataturk was the goal which 
cannot be deviated from 
he referred to kemal ataturk founder of modern turkey in 1923 
and proponent of a westernallied secular state 
the military has toppled civilian governments three times since 
1960 the latest takeover was in 1980 following a period of 
political violence that claimed 5000 lives

a united states senator was shouting 
accusations at robert s bennett when the special ethics counsel 
began to fidget in his black swivel chair 
sen dennis deconcini was good and mad gesturing vividly while 
he complained that bennett was out to get him and the other 
socalled keating five 
bennett squirmed in his seat while deconcini hurled accusations 
bennett was personally trying to write new standards of conduct for 
the senate bennett was no longer a independent investigator but a 
prosecutor who wanted the five senators as a trophy 
finally the senator sat down the senate ethics committee 
hearing room was quiet as the stocky attorney rose to speak in 
rebuttal 
these are not my standards bennett said speaking directly 
to the committee with a forceful voice but not hurrying his words 
and just because you cant go to the government printing office 
and say hey give me the ethical standard that covers all 
situations doesnt mean they dont exist gentlemen youre a lot 
better than that 
while many lawyers hired by congress to conduct a highly visible 
investigation may show great reverence to us senators bennett is 
not one of them he is not intimidated by the committee members who 
hired him or the lawmakers he was brought in to investigate 
bennett 51 is known for his straightforward even blunt 
speech 
he is a nononsense litigator who has a way of getting across 
to a whole spectrum of different people said peter p mullen 
executive partner of the 1100lawyer new yorkbased firm of 
skadden arps slate meagher and flom which hired bennett this 
year he can talk to princes and paupers kings and the 
homeless 
bennetts expertise is in defending businessmen accused of white 
collar crimes mullen said his firm scoured the country before 
hiring him to head its white collar practice by the time the deal 
was completed bennett had brought along from his former firm 14 
other lawyers three legal assistants and four secretaries 
the ethics committee also could point to bennetts experience 
when he was hired a year ago to investigate sens deconcini 
dariz john mccain rariz donald w riegle jr dmich john 
glenn dohio and alan cranston dcalif the five intervened with 
thrift regulators on behalf of former sampl owner charles h keating 
jr a political contributor 
bennett was special counsel in the investigation of sen dave 
durenberger rminn who the senate denounced earlier this year 
for financial misconduct 
and he performed the same role in the case of former sen 
harrison a williams jr dnj who quit the senate in 1982 just 
as the chamber was about to expel him for bribery 
bennetts response to deconcini in the opening days of the 
ongoing ethics committee hearing told a lot about himself 
he told the committee the only trophy he wanted was the one he 
already had in the wall of his office which also has a panoramic 
view of the washington monument and environs 
the trophy is a stuffed 5pound 2ounce brown trout he caught 
in 1985 underneath the fish is a saying that bennett shows clients 
in hopes theyll heed the advice if i had kept my mouth shut i 
wouldnt be here 
and he reminded the committee that many senate standards of 
conduct were not written by him but by former sen paul douglas of 
illinois in 1951 when bennett was growing up in brooklyn and only 
interested in the dodgers 
bennetts rebuttal also mentioned his three teenage daughters 
to make the point that even the school they attended has standards 
of conduct 
whenever i have a case i feel is important i always work my 
daughters in bennett said later its just something to make 
them feel good to let them know im thinking about them 
sitting in his office for an interview bennett remembered 
that he may be focused on his work now but once was more 
interested in cutting school to watch games at old ebbitts field 
one day i was yelling come on pee wee reese and i felt a 
hand on my shoulder it was my father bennett said who had been 
tipped off by a friend that his son was at the ballpark 
bennetts father a banker officer expressed his displeasure 
that day but now bennett says i have one request for this 
story mention my father f robert bennett 
bennett is not the only highprofile member of his family 
younger brother william is incoming chairman of the republican 
national committee formerly the national drug czar and a secretary 
of education robert bennett though says hes strictly 
nonpolitical 
a favorite hoby is fishing for brown trout in montana and a 
year ago bennett bought a home near livingston along the 
yellowstone river 
bob is a good spin fisherman but now hes trying to become a 
good fly fisherman said bennetts pal lenny gregrey of 
livingston a retired new york city police lieutenant 
his only frustration is he cant tie knots his fingers wont 
work i gave him a written test and he got all flustered gregrey 
said of his usually unflappable friend 
he was sweating over the questions

some top congressional democrats say that if 
war breaks out in the persian gulf lawmakers should consider an 
income tax surcharge to raise the tens of billions of dollars the 
fighting likely would cost 
the idea similar to the surtax that helped finance the vietnam 
war drew a negative response from one white house official and a 
mostly skeptical reaction from several republican congressional 
leaders tuesday 
nonetheless some democrats say a war against iraq would be so 
expensive that it would be a blow to the weakening economy if the 
government was forced to borrow the money 
war is a very expensive proposition said senate budget 
committee chairman james sasser dtenn who was among the first 
to publicly discuss the idea if we go into a war we have to 
find some way to pay for it not to shove these costs onto future 
generations by borrowing 
the proposal has yet to be embraced by house speaker thomas 
foley dwash or senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
but for democrats skeptical of attacking iraq soon calling for 
a surtax underscores the domestic price of going to war 
sasser said he envisions a surtax of about 5 percent to 10 
percent 
during the height of us involvement in southeast asia 
president johnson persuaded congress to approve a 10 percent income 
tax surcharge to pay for the war taxpayers would calculate the 
amount of money they owed the government and simply increase it by 
10 percent 
the surtax was in effect from april 1968 through december 1969 
because of it fiscal 1969 was the last time the federal budget ran 
a surplus finishing 32 billion in the black 
rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget 
committee agreed that a surtax should be weighed if fighting 
breaks out in the persian gulf 
the prevalent view is if we sustain our current level of 
operations wed be able to handle that panetta said when you 
go beyond that into a fullscale war thats when the question 
marks start coming 
if war occurs and we incur substantial costs do we need to 
come up with a way to pay for it absolutely yes said rep steny 
hoyer dmd a member of the house democratic leadership 
one white house official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said it would be premature to talk about using a surtax to pay for 
a war against iraq 
and its not clear that thats the way to go the official 
said 
republican lawmakers seemed mostly opposed to the idea although 
house minority leader robert michel rill said im not going 
to prejudge anything 
we may have to consider cutting spending to pay for those 
costs said no 2 house republican newt gingrich of georgia who 
led the antitax faction of the house gop during this years budget 
negotiations i know thats an unthinkable alternative for sasser 
and panetta 
the administration has not released an estimate of what a war in 
the gulf would cost 
in september when the united states was building a force of 
240000 troops defense secretary dick cheney said the price of 
maintaining it would be 15 billion this fiscal year last month 
president bush said he would add 200000 troops to the total but 
the administration has provided no new cost estimate 
democrats citing studies by private defense analysts say 
fighting could cost 1 billion to 2 billion per day republicans 
using experts of their own say a threemonth war could cost 15 
billion to 30 billion 
under new budget procedures the costs of us operations in the 
middle east will not be counted as part of the official federal 
deficit but to pay its military expenses in the gulf the 
government will have to either raise taxes cut spending or borrow 
money

a thief can steal more money with a computer 
than with a gun and a terrorist can spread more chaos with a 
keyboard than with a bomb experts said today 
we are at risk the national research council said in a 
300page report increasingly america depends on computers they 
control power delivery communications aviation and financial 
services 
they are used to store vital information from medical records 
to business plans to criminal records although we trust them they 
are vulnerable 
the report titled computers at risk calls for a coherent 
national effort to develop security systems and increase public 
awareness of the dangers posed by vulnerable computers to accidents 
and deliberate attack 
to date we have been remarkably lucky the council said 
it pointed out that although money and information have been 
stolen lives have been lost because of computer errors and 
communications and financial systems have been disrupted there has 
been no systematic attempt to subvert critical computing systems 
unfortunately there is reason to believe that our luck will 
soon run out the report said thus far we have relied on the 
absence of malicious people who are both capable and motivated we 
can no longer do so we must instead attempt to build computer 
systems that are secure and trustworthy 
as evidence of how untrustworthy computers are the report 
listed these examples 
a nearly successful attempt to use thousands of phony bank of 
america automatic teller machine cards fabricated with personal 
identification numbers stolen from an online data base 
thousands of reported virus attacks and hundreds of different 
viruses identified such as stoned devils dance 1260 jerusalem 
yankee doodle pakistani brain icelandic2 ping pong and december 
24 
a software design error that froze much of american telephone amp 
telegraphs long distance network 
the german chaos computer club breakins to the nasa space 
physics analysis network 
the 1988 internet worm incident robert morris of arnold 
md is appealing his conviction in federal court for unleashing a 
program that paralyzed thousands of computers linked to the 
nationwide program 
an error in computer software controlling a radiation therapy 
machine a therac 25 linear accelerator resulted in at least three 
patient deaths 
a cleveland man allegedly mailed more than 26000 
virusinfected diskettes with aids prevention information to 
hospitals businesses and government agencies worldwide 
whatever trust was justified in the past will not be justified 
in the future unless action is taken now the report said 
it recommended that an institution be created to accelerate the 
commercialization and adoption of safer and more secure computer 
and communications systems 
a major activity of the group would be to evaluate products with 
respect to security the organization must not be a captive 
of government system vendors or individual segments of the user 
community the report said 
but it would need the highest level of government support even 
a congressional charter the report said adding the committee 
sees this proposal as a test of commitment for industry 
the national research council is an arm of the national academy 
of sciences a private organization chartered by congress

the pilot of a dc9 that collided in fog 
with another jetliner on an airport runway killing eight people 
returned to the cockpit only last week from a fiveyear medical 
leave officials said tuesday 
the national transportation safety board said tuesday night that 
northwest airlines capt william lovelace was at the controls 
monday when the plane ran into a boeing 727 racing for takeoff at 
detroit metropolitan airport 
investigators said earlier tuesday it was unclear whether 
lovelace of phoenix or his first officer james f schifferns of 
spokane wash was piloting the plane 
schifferns who spent 20 years in the air force was hired by 
northwest in march his first job in commercial aviation 
ntsb investigators said they were looking at such factors as 
human error weather and equipment as possible causes of the 
accident 
a fireball fed by fuel burned away the top of the 
pittsburghbound dc9 after the right wingtip of the northwest 727 
tore open the dc9s fuselage and dislodged an engine 
noxious fumes killed six men and two women among the 43 people 
aboard the dc9 said wayne county chief medical examiner bader 
cassin seven people remained hospitalized two of them in critical 
condition 
ic payne a passenger on the dc9 said he couldnt see much 
out his window and just remembers a piece of shrapnel striking him 
on the head 
it nearly knocked me out of my seat said payne a quality 
inspector for general electric based in fort wayne ind the 
first thing i did was reach up to see if all my head was still on 
then i heard someone in the front of the plane yell out that the 
engine just blew 
nbc news reported tuesday night that it had obtained partial 
transcripts of an exchange between an air traffic controller and 
the dc9 cockpit 
that exchange showed the controller asking the pilot to verify 
his position uh were not sure its so foggy out here were 
completely stuck here looks like were on 21center here nbc 
quoted the transcripts as saying 
the collision occurred near the end of runway 3c which leads 
directly into runway 21c the dc9 turned off a taxiway into runway 
3c and into the path of the 727 officials said 
the federal aviation administration said it had not reviewed the 
control tower transcripts and could not comment on the nbc report 
ntsb spokesman alan pollock said we obviously had interviews 
with people in the tower and we have determined the dc9 was having 
visibility problems as far as exact wording i cannot comment on 
that 
the crew of another northwest flight reported overhearing a 
flight crew say they were unsure of their location but that they

after nasser was 
released from a sixyear prison term for attacking israeli 
soldiers he was hoping to find a job and settle down to a normal 
life 
that didnt happen 
instead nasser 27 was ordered to turn in his orange 
israeliissued identification card it was replaced by a green one 
that says in hebrew and arabic the holder of this card is not 
allowed to enter israel 
nasser is one of at least 2400 palestinians in the west bank 
getting green cards under new strictures following more than a 
dozen stabbing attacks by palestinians on israelis in the past two 
months 
having a green card prevents the holders from working in israel 
where palestinians have provided much of the cheap labor as 
restaurant workers garbage men or as in nassers case 
construction workers 
i thought my punishment ended but i guess it is just 
beginning said nasser who was interviewed at his fathers home 
in this refugee camp near bethlehem he asked that the family name 
not be used for fear of reprisal 
nasser was jailed for firebombings aimed at israel patrols and 
attacks on palestinians suspected of collaborating with israel he 
says no one was killed or injured in the incidents 
he feels he paid his dues in prison and worries that he will 
have trouble supporting himself and wont be able to help his 
retired parents 
its like being back in prison he said 
nasser was in jail while tensions grew enormously between arabs 
and israelis during the last three years of the palestinian 
uprising 
in the past two months stabbing attacks by arabs seeking 
revenge for the deaths of 17 palestinians in jerusalems temple 
mount riots have brought counterattacks by israelis and increased 
calls for blocking palestinians from entering israel 
following a fatal stabbing attack sunday in greater tel aviv 
the coastal area that is israels main population center hundreds 
of police on tuesday set up checkpoints on roads leading to the 
jewish state 
police not only checked for green cards but frisked any 
palestinian trying to cross the green line israels boundary with 
the west bank and gaza strip before it seized the territories in 
the 1967 middle east war 
green cards were first issued to palestinians in february 1989 
but the program has been stepped up in the past month 
shmuel ozenboy a spokesman for the military government of the 
occupied territories said the 2400 new green cards issued brings 
to 10800 the number of palestinians barred from entering israel 
because of crimes or antiisraeli activities 
news reports said that following sundays tel aviv attack 
officials were considering raising the total of banned palestinians 
to about 15000 
the number could potentially include any of the 60000 people 
jailed during the palestinian uprising including thousands held 
without ever being formally charged or tried 
economics minister david magen already has suggested that the 
110000 palestinians who work in israel be cut to 50000 to create 
jobs for the thousands of soviet jews being resettled in israel 
similar calls for banning palestinians in the past have been 
thwarted by employers dependence on cheap palestinian labor and 
israelis distaste for menial jobs 
defense minister moshe arens argued at a parliament committee 
this wee that it would be naive to expect to instantly end 
israels dependence on cheap arab labor 
we should change the state of affairs but it would only be 
possible in gradual stages and with planning he said 
both palestinians and israelis have warned that cutting off 
palestinians from jobs when they are frustrated at the uprisings 
failure to produce political gains could further increase 
violence 
job openings in the territories are almost nonexistent because 
israel routinely refuses permits for factories keeping the west 
bank and gaza a captive market the uprising has further reduced 
jobs for the 17 million palestinians in the territories 
abdul fatah abu shukur dean of the economics department at 
annajah university in the west bank city of nablus said the 
territories unemployment rate of more than 25 percent would be 
driven up by the green cards

president bushs selection of conservative 
william bennett to head the republican national committee is 
prompting i told you sos from critics who doubt the partys 
commitment to minority concerns 
civil rights advocates see the choice of bennett an ardent foe 
of racial quotas as a departure from rnc chairman lee atwaters 
highprofile effort to woo black voters over the last two years 
bushs decision sends the wrong signal to blacks especially 
following his veto of sweeping civil rights legislation that blacks 
considered a litmus test said howard university political science 
professor ron walters 
it lends credence to my opinion that the republican party was 
never really serious about this walters said voicing the 
opinion of many who have been suspicious of the gops intentions 
however rnc officials insist that bennett will continue the 
minority outreach program and that his staunch opposition to 
minority hiring quotas should not affect that 
atwater who is battling a brain tumor and will remain as the 
partys general chairman often said his longrange goal was to 
bring more minorities to the party 
it also was his shortterm goal for the 1990 election in which 
22 percent of the blacks voted for republicans in congressional 
races according to a new york timescbs news poll that was up 7 
percentage points from 1988 and double the percentage found in 
1982 
sources said atwater urged bush to sign the civil rights 
legislation that came to the presidents desk shortly before the 
nov 6 election 
bush vetoed the bill after a fight within his administration 
the president contended it would lead to racial hiring quotas 
although language in the measure said it was not intended to 
encourage quotas 
the selection of bennett was like salt in the wound after the 
veto said ralph neas executive director of the leadership 
conference on civil rights 
it appears that once again president bush has cast his lot 
with the right wing his core constituency with the wealthy and 
the privileged neas charged 
bennett has several strikes against him as far as minority 
groups are concerned including his recent help in the racially 
tinged reelection bid of sen jesse helms rnc 
bennett defended helms campaign advertisements that were widely 
criticized for racial overtones and said north carolina was the 
most harmonious place ive been for race relations helms beat 
back a strong challenge by harvey gantt a black democrat 
bennett later said he was eager to do battle with democrats over 
racial quotas and affirmative action 
when he was president reagans chairman of the national 
endowment for the humanities in the mid1980s bennett refused to 
set numerical goals directed by the equal employment opportunity 
commission for hiring women and minorities 
critics said he steered the endowments funds away from research 
on black and womens studies 
then as reagans education secretary bennett blasted colleges 
and universities that he said were imposing unofficial quotas 
he wrote a book counting by race in 1979 that lays out a 
historical argument against using quotas for hiring or college 
admissions 
republican civil rights advocates are trying to put the best 
face on bennetts pending chairmanship most recently bushs 
antidrug czar he still must be approved by a vote of the 
republican national committee members 
rnc spokesman bj cooper said bennetts statements on quotas 
mirror exactly the administrations policy and that the party is 
committed more than ever to recruiting minority voters and 
candidates 
give the man a chance said thaddeus garrett jr an 
informal adviser to bush on minority issues and a backer of the 
civil rights bill 
garrett said he hopes that the die is cast and that bill 
bennett will have no other desire than to make sure this outreach 
program continues 
it doesnt do me any good not to be hopeful said garrett 
arthur fletcher chairman of the civil rights commission who 
also disagreed with bush on whether the civil rights legislation 
was a quota bill said he hopes bennetts appointment will 
force a needed debate on civil rights 
since they made the move and appointed the guy lets have the 
debate the assumption is that because hes there hes uust going 
to turn everybody off im saying let bennett express himself 
said fletcher

cleaning up the mess left behind 
by departing soviet troops is likely to cost tens of millions of 
dollars the state ctk news agency reports 
the ministry of control estimates that damages to the 
environment and to buildings occupied by soviet troops in czech 
lands for the past 22 years will run as high as 285 million ctk 
said tuesday 
the estimate did not include the damage caused by soviet 
soldiers in the countrys eastern republic slovakia 
according to the report most historical buildings in northern 
bohemia have been damaged the area around ceska lipa near the 
borders with poland and what was formerly east germany are the most 
severely damaged ctk said 
soviet soldiers vandalized the interior of the castle of decin 
50 miles north of prague and turned the castles basement into a 
reservoir of feces ctk said 
the pullout of soviet troops from czechoslovakia began in 
february but differences over financial compensation for damages 
they have caused during their 22year stay have yet to be resolved 
moscow has agreed to withdraw all the troops stationed on 
czechoslovak territory by july 1991 
the agreement was reached after the peaceful revolution last 
year that ousted the communist leaders put in place after a 
sovietled invasion in 1968 crushed reform 
the soviet union has a similar agreement with hungary and that 
country is also seeking financial compensation for damages 
resulting from the soviet soldiers decadeslong stay

an agriculture department report says theres 
a good reason why farmers in the european community take to the 
streets when their subsidies are threatened the protests have 
usually worked 
in late august for example french farmers protested low prices 
they had been getting for beef and lamb blaming cheaper imports 
from britain ireland and eastern europe 
groups of angry french farmers hijacked imported shipments 
destroyed beef and lamb carcasses and set live animals loose in 
town squares other acts included killing sheep or lambs in public 
and british trucks carrying live sheep twice were set on fire 
farmers in the ec stage such protests largely because the 
demonstrations are successful the report said the french 
agriculture minister while condemning the demonstrators violence 
announced measures designed to relieve some of the profit 
squeeze 
the tradition of protests continued this week as negotiators met 
in brussels in a lastditch attempt to revamp the worlds trading 
system 
police used tear gas and water cannons on monday to disperse 
30000 farmers protesting the talks being held under the auspices 
of the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
the socalled uruguay round of talks for the liberalization of 
world trade has been clouded by persistent snarls over agricultural 
issues primarily the refusal of the 12nation ec to go along with 
substantive reductions in farm subsidies favored by the united 
states and most other gatt members 
european farmers typically small and heavily dependent on ec 
subsidies and protection from outside imports fear they would be 
swamped by the marketoriented policies sought by the others 
the report by economist mary lisa madell of usdas economic 
research service was published in the december issue of 
agricultural outlook magazine 
farmers may have a lot to protest but they face some economic 
realities that politicians in brussels and the national capitals 
cannot change the report said 
for instance the average size of the ecs 9 million farmers is 
only 33 acres it added those averages range from 161 acres in the 
united kingdom to less than 10 acres in greece 
the larger more efficient farms can flourish under the high 
level of support provided by the blocs common agricultural 
policy or cap but many smaller operations still struggle to 
survive 
until the mid1980s the community adjusted prices under the cap 
to ensure that farmers could earn a good living from the land but 
costs grew burdensome and chronic surpluses developed 
thus price supports or intervention prices have remained 
stable or have been shaved somewhat since then even so the cap 
price levels are still high compared with world prices and 
overproduction remains a problem the report said 
current attempts in the uruguay round to reduce tradedistorting 
price supports and phase out longstanding ec export subsidies have 
helped stir the conflict further 
health scares such as the mysterious new cattle disease bovine 
spongiform encephalopathy or mad cow disease in the united 
kingdom and ireland have taken a toll 
so have concerns over food poisoning outbreaks and local 
scandals over hormones in meat supplies animal rights issues are 
also worrying livestock producers the report said 
 
washington ap the agriculture department has plugged a 
loophole that allowed about 5 percent of the peanuts sold for human 
consumption to be marketed without federal inspection 
officials said the new regulation which took effect tuesday 
was required by congress in legislation a year ago 
daniel d haley administrator of the departments agricultural 
marketing service said approximately 95 percent of the peanuts 
marketed for human consumption are sold under marketing orders and 
are inspected and certified for size quality and condition 
the new rule covers those peanuts not covered by the marketing 
orders 
haley said the agency conducts the program on a fee basis for 
peanut handlers most handlers operate under a peanut marketing 
agreement authorized by federal law 
an 18member comittee of peanut producers and handlers 
administers the program which is financed by assessments on 
handlers 
haley said that under the agreement peanut handlers are 
indemnified for peanuts tested and found unsuitable for human 
consumption because of aflatoxin contamination aflatoxin a 
naturally occurring chemical that can cause cancer can result from 
a certain kind of crop mold or fungus 
only handlers who have signed the agreement are eligible for 
indemnification he said 
handlers whose peanuts until now have not been tested but will 
be now under the new law may wish to sign the agreement to take 
advantage of the indemnification haley said 
those interested should contact peanut administrative 
committee po box 18856 lenox square station atlanta ga 
30326 telephone 4042617800 
 
washington ap last year the united states sold 17 million 
worth of crayfish to sweden up from 6 million in 1988 says the 
agriculture department 
swedes turned to us crayfish providers after their own 
domestic supply was jeopardized by a fungus and pollution the 
departments foreign agricultural service said in this months 
agexporter magazine 
the small lobsterlike crustaceans are known by many names 
depending on where you buy them theyre crayfish in sweden but in 
louisiana the main source for us exports the creatures are 
crawfish 
and in tennessee and many other places theyre crawdads or 
something else dont ask for crayfish in australia the report

the head of the drug enforcement 
administration says he is pleased that the justice department found 
no support for news reports his agency was involved in the bombing 
of pan am flight 103 
however dea administrator robert c bonner added tuesday im 
concerned that there may be some subliminal impact on the 
agencys reputation this would be unfortunate as it is clear 
there was no connection between dea activity of any kind and the 
pan am 103 tragedy 
the dec 21 1988 explosion over lockerbie scotland killed 259 
people aboard the plane and 11 on the ground the new yorkbound 
flight originated in frankfurt with a stop in london where 
passengers and luggage were transferred to another aircraft 
news reports in late october alleged that terrorists took 
advantage of an undercover dea operation to smuggle explosives 
aboard the plane 
the dea quickly rebutted the reports but the parent justice 
department ordered further inquiries by the dea and especially the 
fbi the lead us agency investigating the bombing 
in a statement tuesday deputy attorney general william p barr 
said while the investigation is continuing the fbi has found no 
evidence to substantiate recent allegations of a connection between 
operations of the dea and the bombing of pan am flight 103 
bonner said in an interview that he understood the delay 
i think it was appropriate to have the bureau fbi take a 
look at this he said to totally rule out even a scintilla of 
concern has taken several weeks 
nbc and abc had reported among other things that the frankfurt 
airport security had been relaxed to accommodate dea agents 
tracking usbound drug shipments from the middle east 
but bonner said evasion of airport security measures even to 
ensure the success of a sting operation is not something we 
do the dea inquiry found specifically that the agency never 
circumvented security measures at the frankfurt airport 
the deas inquiry also found that it had no investigative or 
operational activity in effect on dec 21 1988 that involved the 
use of pan am flight 103 or frankfurt international airport barr 
said 
in addition the dea probe rejected contentions that flight 103 
passenger khalid nazir jaafar of detroit was part of an undercover 
dea operation 
lew kreindler a lawyer for us relatives of flight 103 
victims said last month that the allegation of an undercover drug 
operation was an old story that had surfaced last year in a 
british newspaper he contended it was an attempt to distract 
attention from pan am which is being sued by the relatives 
pan am has maintained its security procedures are second only to 
those of el al the israeli airline 
investigators believe members of the popular front for the 
liberation of palestine conducted the bombing but the fbi has not 
produced enough evidence to bring criminal charges law enforcement 
sources say british and german authorities also are investigating 
the bombing

scientists think they found the smoking gun 
to show that asteroids wiped out the dinosaurs a 110milewide 
crater in mexico possibly gouged by a mountainsize rock smashing 
to earth 
the crater near the yucatan peninsula town of chicxulub may have 
been ground zero for the collision that some scientists believe 
killed dinosaurs 65 million years ago university of arizona 
scientist bill boynton said tuesday 
the collision with the estimated power of 70 million 
onemegaton bombs could have kicked up 3milehigh tidal waves and 
a sparked a worldwide firestorm 
we think we have found the smoking gun but there may be other 
guns and maybe a firing squad boynton said during a meeting of 
the american geophysical union 
boynton and other researchers said another impact crater 22 
miles wide near manson iowa and possible craters under the 
caribbean near colombia and cuba point to the possibility a shower 
of asteroids or comets caused the extinction 
the yucatan crater boynton and his colleagues theorize was 
caused by an asteroid striking shallow mexican waters is now on dry 
land buried by 65 million years of sediment 
the study by alan hildebrand boynton and others was the latest 
of more than 2000 in the past 12 years that examined whether 
asteroids huge volcanic eruptions or slow climate change sent the 
dinosaurs to oblivion 
in 1978 scientists found deposits of iridium metal in 
65millionyearold rocks around the world iridium is rare on 
earth but less rare in asteroids and comets the killerasteroid 
theory was born because an impact would have spread iridium dust 
around the globe 
the theory is that a 6milewide asteroid or comet or a comet 
shower smacked into the earth kicking debris into the atmosphere 
and causing radical environmental damage that wiped out the 
dinosaurs and up to 75 percent of all species 
we wouldnt be here if it hadnt been for the extinction of 
the dinosaurs said geologist walter alvarez of the university of 
california at berkeley they were ruling the place mammals were 
just running around underfoot until the impact killed the dinosaurs 
and let us evolve 
some researchers think the impact or impacts clouded the sky 
with smoke dust or debris that blocked out sunlight and wiped out 
food supplies others have theorized somewhat in jest that 
changes in vegetation upset the dinosaurs diet leaving them 
fatally constipated 
other possible deadly effects of asteroids hitting earth include 
acid rain giant tidal waves dark freezing weather global warming 
by the greenhouse effect and a worldwide firestorm that broiled 
creatures in their tracks

with christmas around the corner the white 
house historical associations souvenir shop is doing a booming 
business once again in christmas ornaments with a presidential 
twist 
it was almost a decade ago that the nonprofit group came up 
with the idea of selling tourists the special christmas keepsakes 
alongside its standard postcards and guidebooks about presidents 
and first ladies 
the shiny ornaments proved a hit with tourists and natives 
alike 
each years ornament has outsold the last and the associations 
executive director bernard f meyer confidently predicts well 
sell in the neighborhood of 150000 to 200000 of the newest one 
the 1990 white house ornament is a colorful miniature of the 
blue room as it looked at yuletime when martin van buren was 
president 150 years ago 
the association which operates out of a townhouse on jackson 
place across from the white house sells the 24 karat goldfinished 
ornaments for 11 or 13 by mail 
meyer said he has heard reports of stores reselling the 
ornaments for as much as 18 
he shrugged off the black market markup saying theres 
nothing we can do about it 
the association which raises funds for acquiring art and 
furnishings for the presidential mansion now counts on the 
christmas ornament sales for twothirds of its 25 million annual 
operating budget 
not all of that is profit but meyer says the group clears 
several hundred thousand dollars from the ornament sales to 
subsidize other projects including a forthcoming new book on white 
house art and paintings 
the association still sells the earlier ornaments from each 
christmas going back to 1981 in keeping with its mission it 
packages them with pamphlets recalling the history of early us 
presidents 
last years ornament was a colorful presidential seal its 
popularity was heightened by a production glitch that led to 
temporary shortages and long lines outside the associations 
townhouse 
the ornaments also are sold at a booth inside the white house 
along the route that more than 1 million visitors follow each year 
meyer said the associations volunteer board of directors has 
turned down proposals for wider marketing of the christmas 
ornaments 
our organization is conservative he said we are not 
connected with the white house but we have the name we dont want 
to do anything that could create an embarrassment 
word of mouth has proven sufficient to propel ornament sales 
upward each year and people who give a white house ornament once 
to friends or relatives often find they are expected to produce the 
new one the next christmas 
meyer knows how that works he says he has to buy 22 himself to 
keep everyone on his gift list happy 
 
editors note ornaments can be ordered by mail at 13 each 
with checks payable to the white house historical association

the government has been trying for years with 
one spectacular failure along the way to develop systems to retard 
aircraft fires such as the one that swept a northwest airlines 
jetliner this week 
the hope at one time was that an antimisting fuel additive 
would prevent the vapors in jet fuel from igniting and exploding in 
a crash 
in ontheground stationary tests the additive appeared to work 
and the federal aviation administration was close to requiring 
airlines to add it to jet fuel 
but when the faa deliberately crashed a remotecontrolled boeing 
720 in the california desert six years ago to test the idea under 
realistic conditions the jetliner exploded in flame 
eleven months later the faa acknowledged the concept is not 
practical for daytoday airline operation in the foreseeable 
future 
the experiment was not repeated and as mondays runway 
collision at detroits metropolitan airport shows fire remains a 
constant hazard in aviation accidents 
the collision of two northwest jetliners a dc9 and a boeing 
727 killed eight people aboard the dc9 and left it a shredded and 
firechared hulk 
the eight apparently died from inhaling noxious fumes before 
their bodies were burned beyond recognition officials said 
at least 20 other people were hospitalized with burns broken 
bones and smoke inhalation 
concern over aircraft fires was dramatized in 1977 when two 
boeing 747 jumbo jets collided on a foggy runway at tenerife in the 
canary islands killing 581 people 
in the years since the failure of the fueladditive experiment 
in 1984 the faa and the department of transportation have 
concentrated on trying to make the immediate surroundings of air 
passengers more flameresistant 
faa officials say the aim is to delay for an additional 60 
seconds the spread of fire inside an aircraft cabin thus providing 
additional time to evacuate 
a year after 23 people were killed in a 1983 smoky fire aboard

the federal reserves relaxation of reserve 
requirements should help fatten the thin profits of large banks at 
taxpayers expense but likely will not greatly stimulate the 
economy in general analysts say 
the central bank said its unusual action announced tuesday was 
aimed in part at encouraging banks to lend to creditworthy 
borrowers easing a shortage of credit 
but private economists said the most visible result of the first 
change in reserve requirements since 1983 likely will be a modest 
increase in bank earnings at a time of increasing strain on the 
industry 
this increases the profit margin to banks but does not 
guarantee more loans said economist allen sinai of the boston 
co it may or may not reduce interest rates 
this is a surgical move to shore up the banking system because 
there is a risk that the banking system could bring the economy 
down more sinai said 
because of the types of reserves reduced large banks likely 
will benefit more than smaller banks he said 
reserve requirements ensure that banks have the cash on hand to 
meet depositor demands institutions must maintain the reserves 
either as cash in the vault or in noninterestbearing accounts 
with the fed 
when the central bank requires fewer reserves banks then have 
more money to make profitearning loans or other investments 
consequently the feds revenue is reduced because it has less 
money to invest in government securities 
as i understand it this is a transfer of profits from the 
treasury to the banking sector said economist paul getman of 
regional financial associates of west chester pa all of the 
feds profits at the end of the year go to the treasury 
the central bank turned over 216 billion in 1989 according to 
a fed official the net effect of tuesdays change depending on 
interest rates will be to deprive taxpayers of roughly 600 
million a year and to bolster bank profits by about the same 
amount 
thats a nice piece of change for the banking sector but i 
dont think its going to do squat to get them to make more 
loans getman said 
he said banks arent tightening credit because they lack money 
to lend but rather because of concerns about the ability of 
borrowers to repay the loans during an economic downturn 
bert ely a financial institutions analyst in alexandria va 
said the reduced reserve requirement will only partly offset a more 
than 60 percent increase next year in banks deposit insurance 
premiums 
what the government taketh with one hand it giveth back 
partially with the other he said 
during the two weeks ending nov 28 institutions maintained 59 
billion in reserves tuesdays change would reduce reserves by 
about 136 billion according to the fed 
the move tuesday affects two types of reserves those held 
against nonpersonal time deposits with maturities of less than 18 
months and net eurocurrency liabilities 
nonpersonal time deposits primarily are certificates of deposit 
purchased by businesses net eurocurrency liabilities are the net 
amounts that banks borrow from their overseas branches 
the reserve requirement on those two types will drop from 3 
percent to 15 percent beginning dec 13 and to zero beginning dec 
27 no change was made in the requirement of a 12 percent reserve 
for transaction accounts primarily checking accounts 
a change in the reserve requirements is the most rarely used of 
the feds three monetary policy tools 
the most common is the purchase or sale of government securities 
to expand or contract the amount of cash available to banks those 
sales directly affect the federal funds rate the interest charged 
among banks for overnight loans the fed has cut the funds rate 
now at 7 percent three times since july each time by a 
quarterpoint 
the next most common is a change in the discount rate the 
interest the fed charges on direct loans to member banks that was 
last changed in february 1989 when it was raised from 6 percent 
to 7 percent

a federalstate task force will review 
corrosion and maintenance problems on the alaska oil pipeline in an 
effort to deter what one official calls a potential disaster 
the transportation department said tuesday the task force will 
assess operation maintenance and safety of the 800milelong 
48inch steel pipeline which snakes from prudhoe bay to the marine 
terminal at valdez and carries a quarter of the nations 
domestically produced crude oil 
the panel also will review environmental protection and 
emergency response procedures 
the formation of the task force was announced by travis p 
dugan head of the departments research and special programs 
administration 
twentyfive percent of this nations domestic oil production 
is transported through this pipeline dugan said its vital 
that the safety and operational procedures used in this system are 
of the highest caliber 
we formed this task force to avoid potential disaster which 
could easily occur if the pipeline is neglected he said it is 
our way of locking the barn door before the horse runs away 
the task force will include representatives of the 
transportation departments office of pipeline safety the pipeline 
monitoring branch of the bureau of land management part of the 
interior department and the state of alaskas department of 
natural resources and office of pipeline monitoring 
a report by the congressional general accounting office in may 
said there has been no proper watch over the maintenance of the 
13yearold pipeline leading to the possibility of an oil spill on 
land equally as disastrous as the march 1989 ocean spill in prince 
william sound 
the pipeline has not received the systematic comprehensive 
oversight needed to ensure compliance with operational safety 
emergency response and environmental requirements the report 
concluded 
gao officials said at the time the situation was worrisome 
because of reports of corrosion in the pipeline they did note 
recent improvement in federal and state checkups on pipeline 
operations and said new efforts at coordination showed promise if 
organized and staffed appropriately 
the pipeline is operated by alyeska pipeline service co which 
said last month it expects to spend 600 million to 800 million by 
1993 on corrosion detection and repair 
alyeska said then it had already repaired 138 corroded sections 
with steel sleeves 
alyeska is a consortium of subsidiaries of the exxon bp arco 
mobil unocal phillips and amerada hess oil companies 
the pipeline carries nearly 2 million barrels of crude oil per 
day that is about oneeighth of all us crude consumption because 
the nation imports half its crude

france signaled a dramatic shift in dealings with 
its former african colonies by ordering french troops in chad to 
stand aside while rebels toppled a regime that paris had backed 
with guns and money since 1982 
the time has passed when france could pick and choose the 
governments in these countries change them or maintain them as it 
wished said foreign minister roland dumas 
foreign legionnaires had grandstand seats when idriss debys 
insurgents marched into chads capital ndjamena on sunday 
having chased president hissene habre across the chari river to 
cameroon 
in other african capitals amidst other upheavals in the past 
french troops have helped prop up friendly regimes habre himself 
received extensive french military support in countering libyan 
incursions in 198687 
but this time habre got no help 
we didnt aid idriss deby we simply left him alone said 
the french development minister jacques pelletier 
as recently as june france helped finance habres reelection 
to the presidency billed as chads first free elections only the 
official party and independent candidates were allowed to run 
but during that same month president francois mitterrand 
spelled out frances new attitude at a francoafrican summit he 
linked french aid to efforts at democratization and stressed that 
his countrys military muscle was not at the disposal of dictators 
seeking to settle scores with domestic rivals 
habre was notably hostile to mitterrands pronouncements saying 
france must not impose western ideological systems on nations 
unable to sustain them 
some skeptics question whether france is prepared to exchange 
its role of gendarme for spectator in all cases arguing that 
expediency dictates the african policies made in paris 
jeanpierre magnant a chad specialist at bordeaux universitys 
institute for political studies is among those unconvinced that 
france will remain faithful to a new policy 
it doesnt change the foundation of things it changes the 
form magnant said of mitterrands pronouncements we support 
the good dictators and those that bother us we let them go 
france acknowledges that libya supplied deby with 40 percent of 
his arms but in a departure from past policy said this was not 
grounds to contain his advances on habre 
some french media have referred to massive libyan arms 
shipments saying paris conveniently chose to ignore what in the 
past would have constituted an aggression by a foreign power 
france which currently has 1800 troops in chad one of the 
worlds poorest nations had backed habre after he took power in a 
1982 coup detat 
deby 38 a master tactician trained at frances war college 
became habres military adviser but he fled last year amid 
allegations of a coup taking refuge in sudan 
deby who began his final offensive nov 10 had implored the 
french to remain neutral and victory in hand thanked them 
france has expressed satisfaction with debys stated wish for 
multiparty democracy in chad like most former french colonies in 
africa chad has had only dictators of various types since gaining 
independence three decades ago 
habre has slowly fallen from grace in paris 
since the fall of communist dictatorships in eastern europe 
several of africas strongmen have been forced to move to 
multiparty systems 
the shock of 1989 had lots of repercussions in africa and 
especially francophone africa where bloody dictatorships were 
everywhere said magnant it is france which made the oneparty 
regimes 
chad is the most dramatic but not the first example of recent 
french neutrality in a conflict in francophone africa 
in may france reinforced its military presence in gabon where 
demonstrations hostile to president omar bongo threatened the 
security of french oil operations but the french troops there to 
protect french citizens avoided intervening in the violence 
the same scenario was played out recently in rwanda where 
french soldiers helped evacuate foreigners and guard the airport 
but engaged in no major fighting against a rebel army 
besides chad and gabon france maintains troops in the ivory 
coast senegal the central african republic and djibouti an 
important french naval base 
the paris newspaper liberation said africa is no longer a top 
priority for france with the ongoing changes in europe and the 
persian gulf crisis chad is but a poor mans war the paper said 
other african despots must now take note that france is no 
longer their life insurance policy liberation wrote

a new study found 91 percent of nonsmokers 
were regularly exposed to high levels of cigarette smoke 
suggesting that the environmental protection agency has 
underestimated the risk of passive smoking a researcher says 
dr michael cummings of the roswell park cancer institute in 
buffalo ny also said childhood exposure to parents cigarette 
smoke could be a greater risk than an adult nonsmokers exposure to 
a spouses or colleagues smoke 
if that is correct lung cancer could be about to increase among 
nonsmokers of the baby boom generation a result of their parents 
widespread adoption of smoking after world war ii cummings said 
he presented his findings tuesday at a meeting of an epa panel 
considering the merits of the agencys draft passive smoking study 
that concludes that cigarette smoke is a known cause of cancer in 
nonsmokers 
the panel has been criticized by antismoking groups after news 
reports disclosed that six of its 16 members had ties to a tobacco 
industry research organization 
questions of potential conflict of interest arose again tuesday 
during a voluntary disclosure of possible conflicts three panel 
members did not disclose that their institutions had received 
tobacco industry grants 
morton lippmann the panels chairman did not mention that 
three researchers in his department at new york university were 
receiving a total of 578000 from the center for indoor air 
research of linthicum md which is financed and operated by the 
tobacco industry 
lippmann declined to be interviewed tuesday 
two other panel members failed to disclose tobacco industry 
research grants to their institutions 
geoffrey kabat did not mention that his employer the american 
health foundation of new york is receiving a 109000 grant this 
year from the center for indoor air research 
kabat also declined comment 
a third panel member jan stolwijk of yale university said his 
department several years ago received a grant of 250000 from the 
rj reynolds tobacco co 
i had nothing to do with it he said as a matter of fact 
i was not happy about it 
the epa panel which was meeting again today at an arlington 
hotel is considering two draft epa reports one concludes that 
cigarette smoke causes 3700 lung cancer cases per year in 
nonsmokers and should be designated a class a carcinogen a known 
cause of human cancer 
the other report is a guide to aid the development of workplace 
smoking policies 
as the meeting opened tuesday rep chet atkins dmass and 10 
other congressmen wrote a letter to epa administrator william 
reilly asking that panel members be required to sever their ties 
to the tobacco industry 
they said epas rule prohibits officials from participating in 
decisions that directly and predictably affect the financial 
interest of an industry in which they have an employment or 
financial stake 
david ryan an epa spokesman said the agency had no comment on 
the letter 
the cummings study measured levels of cotinine a nicotine 
breakdown product in the urine of 669 nonsmokers he found that 91 
percent had detectable levels 
that means they had been exposed probably in the past week 
to tobacco smoke he said 
when this hitherto unsuspected high background exposure to smoke 
is taken into account studies suggest that women married to 
smokers may have more than double the risk of lung cancer than do 
women married to nonsmokers 
the epa which did not take the background exposure into 
account concluded that wives of smokers have a 28 percent increase 
in lung cancer risk compared to wives of nonsmokers 
j donald debethizy of the rj reynolds tobacco said small 
amounts of nicotine found in some foods could be producing some of 
the cotinine cummings measured but others disagreed 
we dont find any evidence that dietary intake is related to 
cotinine said joellen lewtas manager of the epas environmental 
tobacco smoke research program 
robert flaak the epa official conducting the panel meeting 
said he was not concerned that the panel members had failed to 
disclose the tobacco grants to their institutions 
the fact that they left something out is not malicious i 
dont think he said the disclosure process is a voluntary 
one 
in materials sent to the panel flaak had written that the 
issues that might be perceived as conflicts of interest include 
the extent to which you or your organization have received 
professional or personal benefits from any individuals 
organizations or groups representing any viewpoint concerning the 
issues under consideration at this meeting

backers of republican fife symington were 
rebuffed by the arizona supreme court in their bid to have him 
declared governor outright without having to compete in a runoff 
feb 26 
symington and his democratic opponent terry goddard praised 
the courts decision tuesday and said they looked forward to the 
runoff 
the legal tangle began when symington outpolled goddard by about 
4000 votes in novembers election but did not get the required 
majority to succeed democratic gov rose mofford who did not run 
this year 
symington supporters acting without his approval went to court 
to argue that the constitutional amendment requiring the runoff was 
invalid because rules on how to implement it had not been passed by 
lawmakers before the election 
the court ruled against the symington supporters three hours 
after hearing arguments the legislature does not have the power 
to eliminate by inaction this constitutional requirement chief 
justice frank gordon jr wrote 
symington supporters said they would decide in a day or two 
whether to go to federal court 
symington after initial hesitation had come out against the 
lawsuit saying he didnt think avoiding a runoff would sit well 
with voters

the justice department says the courts have no 
role in political discussions between president bush and congress 
over whether to go to war in the mideast 
arguing that it was a matter for the political branches of 
government congress and the white house assistant attorney 
general stuart m gerson asked tuesday for dismissal of a lawsuit 
by 54 democratic members of congress that seeks an injunction 
requiring bush to seek congressional approval before attacking 
iraqi forces 
lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that the court should tell the 
president not be snubbing his nose at congress 
gerson told us district judge harold h greene that an 
injunction is unnecessary because there has been no decision one 
way or another to deploy forces against iraq 
it may well be that iraq will come to its senses it may very 
well be for the congress to endorse the united nations resolution 
passed last week by the security council authorizing force to expel 
iraqi troops from kuwait after jan 15 gerson said at this 
point its a matter to be worked out by the political branches 
gerson argued that granting the injunction would put this 
court directly in the way of defining what a war is itself 
becoming commanderinchief gerson said 
the plaintiffs contend that the warpowers clause of the 
constitution requires a declaration of war or some other 
authorization by congress before the president may launch us 
forces 
i think the president is snubbing his nose at congress and i 
think the court should say he cannot continue to do so 
university of pittsburgh law professor jules lobel argued for the 
lawmakers this suit is not about whether we ought to go to war 
but who ought to make that decision 
but greene expressed skepticism about lobels argument noting 
that the bush administration views the war powers clause as a 
process for the two political branches to agree when there is a 
war 
it doesnt have to involve the judiciary greene said you 
also have a problem to overcome in that no court has ever issued an 
injunction you are asking for 
presidents have ordered armed forces to engage in hostilities 
more than 200 times since the founding of the republic congress 
has issued only five declarations of war though it sometimes has 
approved of presidential action through other resolutions 
the constitution says the congress shall have power to 
declare war and also the president shall be commander in 
chief of the armed forces

westerners hiding from the iraqi 
army in kuwait growing desperate are thinking of surrendering 
before christmas just to have contact with their families a 
recently arrived kuwaiti refugee says 
dr abdullah alshayeji a 32yearold economics professor at 
kuwait university said tuesday that kuwaitis were still risking 
their lives to get food water and medicine to mostly british and 
american men hiding from the iraqis 
he said iraq was not mounting active patrols to look for them 
but moved quickly when informants told them where westerners might 
be hiding 
iraq has promised to execute anyone hiding a westerner in 
kuwait 
foreigners who are caught are transported to iraq where they 
are deployed as human shields at strategic targets around the 
country to try to deter an attack by western forces about 600 
americans british and japanese are held at such sites 
up to 2000 british and american men are still believed hiding 
in kuwait 
americans and britons told alshayeji that many are considering 
giving themselves up just to talk to their wives and other loved 
ones at christmas said the professor 
he said he had been in regular contact with four americans and 
also spoke to the us embassy in kuwait 
alshayeji said that before he drove to saudi arabia on nov 29 
two hostages told him to contact their families and tell them they 
were on the verge of turning themselves in 
he said they want the us government to take action against 
iraq they are wiped out mentally physically morale is down 
they are basket cases every one of them 
since the kuwaitis help the westerners avoid iraqi patrols find 
them empty houses to live in and get them food the foreigners are 
in increasing danger as more kuwaitis flee the country 
the kuwait information office in saudi arabia says 200 kuwaitis 
have crossed the border into saudi arabia daily since early 
october and just 200000 of the original population of 570000 
native kuwaitis remain behind 
alshayeji said the iraqi forces had been especially vigilant at 
the university while they systematically stripped kuwait of 
everything of value 
it has been wiped out period everything that could be moved 
was moved said the professor who was an undergraduate at 
oklahoma state university and received his doctorate at the 
university of texas 
the five campuses of kuwait university which once held 18000 
students are no longer functioning and neither are the countrys 
600 schools meaning there will be no 199091 academic year for any 
students who stay in kuwait the professor said

development of the navys 487 billion 
seawolf attack submarine should be slowed until technical and 
financial problems are solved says a house committee report 
released today 
the vessel is perhaps the most conspicuous and potentially 
most costly example of a program struggling with the problems of 
adapting stateoftheart computer technology into a 
multibilliondollar weapons platform says the government 
operations committee report 
it recommends that congress limit funding for construction of 
additional seawolf submarines until the pentagon clarifies the 
programs mission and provides assurances that the computer 
problems will be fixed 
spokesman lt greg smith said the navy would have no immediate 
comment 
pentagon plans call for building 29 of the ships for 487 
billion with the first scheduled for completion in 1995 at an 
estimated cost of 19 billion it is billed as the largest 
quietest and most heavily armed nuclear attack submarines

the ability of mammograms to detect breast 
cancer early has improved significantly since 1985 says the food

the agency said tuesday that greater radiation now being used is 
justified by the improved quality of images is still within fda 
safety guidelines and is about twothirds lower than 1979 levels 
fda surveys of mammography equipment in 1985 showed that 36 
produced substandard images a survey by the agency in 1988 found 
the rate had declined to 13 percent 
i hope the surveys will encourage women to make greater use of 
mammography said dr james mason assistant secretary for health 
at the department of health and human services early detection 
and treatment offer women their best chance of surviving breast 
cancer 
the national cancer institute recommends that women over 40 have 
regular mammograms 
a report on the fdas surveys was published in the november

the immigration and naturalization service 
says it has released 75 salvadorans from custody in anticipation of 
a new form of legal residence for them 
the 75 were those who may qualify for socalled temporary 
protected status under the new immigration law signed last week 
by president bush 
this provision was established for salvadorans illegally in this 
country who fear returning to their wartorn homeland but 
nonetheless do not qualify for regular refugee status 
to be admitted to legal residence as a refugee an immigrant 
must demonstrate a wellfounded fear of persecution at home 
the immigration and naturalization service in the past has 
contended that most salvadorans who enter the united states 
illegally could not qualify as refugees 
the new law permits those salvadorans in the united states 
before sept 19 and here continuously since then to apply for 
temporary protected status as of jan 2 permitting them to 
work legally and banning their deportation 
the law contains provision for eventual extension to citizens of 
other nations temporary protected status is to last only 18 
months from jan 1 
an ins statement tuesday quoted the head of the service gene 
mcnary as saying in keeping with the humanitarian spirit of the 
temporary protected status program the service was releasing 
salvadorans in custody who could qualify

the picture had no particular scientific 
value but astronomers were still hopping up and down with 
excitement over the first photo taken by whtt will soon be the 
worlds most powerful optical telescope 
scientists said the 942 million keck telescope at mauna kea 
hawaii will peer deeper into space than ever before and yield 
clues to the creation of the universe 
astronomers on tuesday displayed kecks first picture which was 
taken with only a quarter of the telescopes 36 mirror segments in 
place when completed it will be the worlds largest telescope with 
a mirror 10 meters in diameter 
the photo of a galaxy 65 million light years from earth more 
than matched the quality of images from the worlds largest 
effective telescope the 5meter hale telescope at mount palomar 
observatory it was taken nov 24 
when we first saw the picture we were really thrilled said 
mirror designer jerry nelson an astronomer at the university of 
california berkeley we were all hopping up and down 
the photograph had no particular scientific value nelson said 
he said the galaxy ngc 1232 was selected simply to demonstrate the 
quality of the telescope which will be fully functioning late next 
year 
astronomers said the keck will allow them to gaze back 12 
billion years in time by revealing light images still traveling 
toward earth 
they will be able to see stars as they appeared some 3 billion 
years after the birth of the universe palomar by contrast 
reaches back 8 billion years 
how did the big bang lead to the structure of the universe 
asked william frazer vice chairman of the california association 
of research in astronomy to understand that weve got to look 
closer to when the galaxies first formed this will enable us to 
get closer 
the keck telescope is the first to be built of automated mirror 
segments it differs from other large telescopes in that its mirror 
is composed of separate hexagonal segments 6 feet in diameter the 
aluminumcoated mirrors are kept in alignment within onemillionth 
of an inch by computercontrolled sensors 
the keck will offer research opportunities not possible with the 
15 billion hubble space telescope which was supposed to see 
farther into the universe than the keck but has a mirror flaw that 
renders it less powerful 
nasa wont be able to fix the orbiting hubble until 1993 
the california institute of technology and the university of 
california are sharing the cost of the keck

cnn got the scoop on manuel noriegas taped phone 
calls but no longer has an exclusive on the story 
us district judge william hoeveler ruled tuesday that 
transcripts of the tapes will be made public thursday unless cnn 
appeals 
he ruled in favor of four news organizations that had argued the 
transcripts were part of the public record and that the public had 
a right to know the facts behind a case that had tested the limits 
of freedom of the press 
cnn had sought to retain exclusive use of the tapes accusing 
the other news organizations of trying to steal their story 
the content never was and never will be cnns said sanford 
bohrer an attorney for the four news organizations the miami 
herald the associated press postnewsweek station wplgtv of 
miami and gannett co and its usa today 
cnn attorney terry bienstock said the network had not decided 
whether to appeal 
he said the judge broke new ground by deciding that material 
used in closed court hearings could be made public 
to the extent it benefits all media cnns pleased about 
that bienstock said but we still see this as a continued 
breach of the newsgathering process by allowing access to 
information gathered under a promise of confidentiality 
cnn has broadcast some of the seven tapes and argued that the 
recordings and therefore the transcripts were its property the 
network said the transcripts should be burned or returned to cnn 
hoeveler disagreed saying cnn did not interview noriega to 
obtain the conversations nor did it record the conversations 
the tapes contain conversations between the deposed panamanian 
dictator who awaits trial on drugtrafficking charges and his 
defense team his lawyers accuse the government of leaking the 
recordings made by prison authorities 
after cnn aired one of the tapes last month noriega attorney 
frank rubino argued that the recordings violate noriegas 
attorneyclient privilege and hoeveler on nov 8 barred the 
network from further such broadcasts 
but cnn aired a tape anyway the next day saying the first 
amendment forbids prior restraint of the media 
cnn stopped the telecasts after a federal appeals court upheld 
the judges ruling the us supreme court on a 72 vote refused 
to intervene 
cnn then submitted the tapes to hoeveler who had the 
transcripts made after all sides examined them in secret the 
judge found the tapes did not prejudice noriegas defense and said 
the network could air them 
noriega is awaiting trial on charges of taking 46 million in 
payoffs to protect the cocaine trade

scientists have computed a table of quake 
odds that will help emergency officials in southern california warn 
the public quickly that the big one may be imminent 
the us geological survey scientists figured out the chances 
that a moderate jolt along the san andreas fault will be followed 
by a catastrophic quake it computed those odds for jolts of 
different sizes and locations 
when a moderate jolt does occur the scientists will consult 
their canned forecasts and will warn state officials if the odds of 
a catastrophic quake striking within the following three days fall 
between 5 percent and 25 percent 
armed with such a warning state officials can tell the public 
and get emergency equipment in place said scientists who unveiled 
the quakeprediction system tuesday at a meeting of the american 
geophysical union 
the idea is to let people know when the possibility exists of 
a larger earthquake on the next several days said jim davis 
californias state geologist 
last month the state announced the nations first detailed plan 
for issuing warnings that there is a strong chance an earthquake 
will strike within days 
under that plan state officials can close schools prepare 
emergency equipment and urge people to stay at home until the 
danger has passed 
a 1988 geological survey report said the big one is at least 60 
percent likely within 30 years somewhere along the southern san 
andreas fault which runs past los angeles 
a 1980 federal emergency management agency report said such a 
quake could kill up to 14000 people hospitalize 55000 and cause 
up to 17 billion in damage

war fears tend to encourage buying of the dollar seen as a safe 
haven in times of trouble 
sky television a british station reported tuesday that iraqi 
president saddam hussein was considering a possible withdrawal from 
kuwait provided iraq were allowed to keep the rumailah oil field 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues which had shed

persian gulf situation might take a favorable turn securities 
dealers said 
the yens rise and higher bond prices also encouraged stock 
purchases although the index lost as many as 235 points at one 
point following a round of buying they said 
but a waitandsee mood basically remains in the market 
partly because of uncertainties about the gulf crisis said takashi 
morinaga of okasan securities

japanese government bonds rose to 8722 as of 5 pm 3 am est

advertisers and regain circulation lost in a 6weekold strike has 
launched its first afternoon edition in nine years 
street hawkers tuesday distributed 30000 copies of the initial 
press run the tabloid had blue ink printed across the top and 
bottom of the front page to distinguish it from morning editions 
we have been champing at the bit to be innovative and try to 
do things when we think its practical to do so said news 
publisher james hoge 
theodore kheel an adviser to the unions called the new edition 
an act of desperation doomed to failure 
using management replacement workers and employees who crossed 
the picket line the news has published every day during the 
strike but its prestrike circulation the nations third highest 
at 109 million has dropped by more than half 
the circulation drop has cost the paper many major advertisers

about 85 million for the year thats on top of losses of 115 
million from 1979 through 1989 
in 1981 the daily news ceased publication of an afternoon 
edition called daily news tonight that paper lasted a year 
the news parent the tribune co of chicago committed 20 
million to that venture but daily news tonight attracted only

puerto rican leaders say it took a riot to draw 
attention to their impoverished communitys problems 
my community has the same problems especially in the poorer 
neighborhoods as the black community weve been completely 
ignored emilio lopez said one day after hundreds rampaged in the 
citys wynwood section 
the fivehour riot erupted monday after six police officers were 
acquitted of conspiracy in the beating death of a reputed drug 
dealer from the neighborhood stores were looted and burned fire 
damage alone was put at 29 million 
business owners tuesday said police were too slow to move in and 
save their shops 
the miami police sacrificed us said patrick gerrits owner 
of a contracting firm that fell victim to the looting and 
vandalism 
only three mismatched shoes remained at a shoe store operated by 
ricardo perezs family i saw people on television running with 
boxes and boxes of our shoes he said the police stood half a 
block away and didnt lift a finger 
police chief perry anderson admitted that the riot squad which 
waited two hours before moving in was slow to react nevertheless 
he defended their caution pointing out that there were no deaths 
or serious injuries 
we live in a very volatile city a powderkeg city he said 
youre damned if you do and youre damned if you dont 
about 15 arrests were made 
it was the fifth major racial uprising in miami in little more 
than a decade previously the riots affected primarily black 
neighborhoods 
there seems to be an invisible government where the voices of 
minorities unless they peak in violence are not heard said 
betzaida ferrer state director of the national puerto rican 
foundation 
emilio lopez said inadequate education health care and social 
services a lack of jobs and tense relations with police plague the 
community and make disturbances more likely 
the jury on monday cleared the officers of conspiracy in the 
beating death of leonardo mercado two years ago and deadlocked on 
more serious civil rights charges the judge declared a mistrial on 
those charges 
community leaders met tuesday night and called for a renewed 
investigation of the slaying they also demanded a retrial on the 
deadlocked charges and better communication with local government 
we are getting a lot of attention now but i dont want within 
48 hours everything to be forgotten said ivette morgan a puerto 
rican member of the community relations board

the main opposition social democrats are in 
the throes of their worst crisis in years after standardbearer 
oskar lafontaine failed to unseat chancellor helmut kohl then 
turned down the party chairmanship 
the leftleaning social democrats are a party without a 
platform they are crippled by internal divisions and desperately 
seeking a new leader of the caliber of senior party member willy 
brandt the former chancellor 
lafontaine said tuesday that he is too busy as governor of 
saarland state to assume the chairmanship 
but he also complained about the halfhearted support his 
campaign received among some social democrats before sundays 
election 
it is impossible to conduct an election campaign without 
solidarity lafontaine said tuesday 
lafontaine refused to fully embrace german unity during the 
campaign 
the resulting damage was especially severe in what had been east 
germany where the party captured just 25 percent of the vote 
social democrats are now viewed by many there as political pariahs 
lafontaine 47 spent most of his campaign warning against the 
pitfalls of unification rather than proposing how unitys problems 
like high unemployment in the eastern lands can be solved 
the spd should wholeheartedly say that unification is a 
positive development said renate koecher a researcher at the 
allensbach polling institute 
secondly they should see the new german states east germany 
as new turf where they have to be intensively engaged 
the party lost a halfmillion votes to kohls christian 
democrats in the opposition partys worst electoral showing since 
1957 it was the social democrats third defeat by kohl since he 
came to power eight years ago 
kohls grasp on germanys leadership is already being compared 
to that of konrad adenauer west germanys first chancellor who 
held office for 14 years 
it really is now a fairly unbalanced political system with a 
very strong predominance of the government parties said peter 
pulzer an oxford university germany specialist who observed the 
elections 
the governing parties led by the christian democrats also 
include the christian social union and free democrats 
it took brandt finally to dislodge adenauers christian 
democrats in 1969 the social democrats are now hunting for a 
leader who can do the same to kohl 
brandt 76 is the social democrats most popular member and is 
respected throughout the party 
the party leadership needs rejuvenation said national 
chairman hansjochen vogel who on tuesday announced plans to step 
down 
possible candidates for the top party job include johannes rau 
walter momper and bjoern engholm 
rau 59 is the popular governor of north rhinewestphalia but 
he lost heavily to kohl in the 1987 chancellor race 
momper the 45yearold former mayor of berlin had been seen as 
a rising star within the social democrats ranks but he lost in 
berlin city elections on sunday 
engholm the 51yearold governor of schleswigholstein state 
is a dapper pipesmoking intellectual popular in his home state 
one of the social democrats best orators 47yearold herta 
daeublergmelin has also been mentioned for the job

verdict clearing them of murder riot and other charges was 
announced 
im sorry for what happened to yusuf hawkins but i had 
nothing to with it i was confident i was secure in my 
innocence serrano said 
serrano was convicted of a weapons offense punishable by up to a 
year in prison sentencing was set for jan 11 
none of hawkins family was in court for the verdict but the 
rev al sharpton a family adviser complained about the verdict 
the first defendants are convicted but when they get to the 
bottom of the list the community pressure is no longer there he 
said maybe we just have to stay on the system all the time

life in prison

lockheed corp says its yf22 advanced 
tactical fighter successfully fired a sidewinder missile in the 
first such launch in the highstakes competition for the pentagon 
contract to build the plane 
the plane passed the test of whether the missile would scorch 
the fuselage or affect the jets handling lockheed spokesman 
richard stadler said tuesday 
a team led by lockheed and one by northrop corp are in a 
winnertakeall competition for the 63 billion contract for the 
atf the replacement for the f15 and the first us fighter to 
carry missiles entirely inside its fuselage 
the pentagon has said it hopes to buy the first of 750 planes 
for the air force in 1996 the navy has indicated it may want about 
500 similar planes 
lockheeds version is more compact than northrops the yf23 
the launch at the remote china lake naval weapons station last 
week had zero effect in the two critical areas stadler said 
like lockheed northrop has produced two prototypes which are 
being tested in a variety of areas such as wind drag handling and 
engine performance 
so far the government has given each team about 750 million to 
develop their versions of the atf and each team has invested more 
than that in its own money since the program began in 1986

windwhipped rain and a rare high tide battered the new england 
coastline forcing evacautions and closing roads a change in wind 
direction eased the chance of more flooding today 
hundreds of coastal residents returned to flooded homes after 
tuesdays storm dumped up to 3 inches of rain in parts of northern 
new england and gave portland maine its fourthhighest tide on 
record 
weather officials said an unusual alignment of the moon sun and 
earth caused tides to rise 2 to 3 feet above normal strong winds 
and heavy rain whipped the waves even higher 
state and local officials had been on alert for the high tide 
and no injuries were reported many feared a repeat of the january 
1987 storm that flooded new england coastal areas 
the tide was expected to crest around noon today forecasters 
said a change in wind direction from southeast to west lessened the 
risk of more flooding 
we shouldnt have any problems said john cannon of the 
national weather service in portland maine the seas should be 
quite a bit lower 
the storm moved out of the midwest where a deadly blizzard 
dumped up to 2 feet of snow on monday 
in providence ri civil defense officials closed the citys 
massive hurricane gates for the first time since hurricane gloria 
brushed the east coast in september 1985 hurricane gates in new 
bedford mass also were closed for about four hours because of 
high tide coming over the seawalls 
on cape cod yarmouth firefighters evacuated about 50 coastal 
residents 
in eastham mass volunteers waited for high tide to recede to 
see what remained of a 6000yearold archaeological find an 
amateur archaeologist discovered last week the volunteers tried to 
save the remains of a campsite hearth and dwelling but had to 
retreat to higher ground as water rose 
authorities in maine said about 100 people were evacuated from 
offices on the portland pier sections of which were under 3 feet 
of water 
winds of 40 mph to 50 mph hit the maine coast the high tide in 
portland was 1365 feet nearly 4 feet above its norm but below the 
citys alltime high of 147 feet

a us congressman today expressed disappointment 
in human rights discussions with chinese officials and said 
beijings prosecution of people involved in the prodemocracy 
movement raises serious rights concerns 
trials of prodemocracy advocates raise questions that will not 
be overshadowed by the persian gulf crisis said robert torricelli 
a new jersey democrat 
torricelli also criticized chinas abstention on a un measure 
authorizing the use of military force to dislodge iraqi troops from 
kuwait he said he told chinese officials this week that they 
missed an important and dramatic opportunity to improve chinas 
international standing 
torricelli a member of the house foreign affairs committee 
said he was disappointed by human rights discussions with vice 
foreign minister liu huaqiu and other foreign ministry officials 
human rights will be the focus of us discussions on chinas 
mostfavored nation trade status and lifting sanctions imposed 
after the bloody crackdown last year on protesters demanding 
democratic reforms he said 
there seems to be a general judgment here that the worst in 
their relationship with the united states has passed that the 
world is looking at other problems that what might happen here 
with further prosecutions will be little noticed he said it 
is my view that that is a tragic mistake if that is their 
judgment 
torricelli said chinese officials voiced regret over the armys 
june 1989 suppression of the prodemocracy movement but seemed most 
concerned with the international condemnation that followed 
soldiers killed hundreds perhaps thousands of protesters 
thousands were arrested in a nationwide crackdown against dissent 
that followed 
according to court officials and chinese sources about a dozen 
major figures in the prodemocracy movement have been charged with 
counterrevolutionary crimes at least two have been charged with 
plotting to overthrow the government a crime punishable by death 
torricelli said china should grant amnesty to people jailed 
because of their political activities linked to the movement 
torricelli also said he told officials china acted irresponsibly 
by abstaining on a security council resolution thursday that 
authorized force against iraq if it refuses to withdraw troops from 
kuwait 
china was the only permanent member of the council that did not 
support it

a new ground radar system to be installed 
at airports in detroit and 29 other cities will help air traffic 
controllers prevent accidents like the one in detroit a federal 
official said 
the new system is designed to track vehicle and aircraft 
movement on runways robert bartanowicz supervisor of the federal 
aviation administration academy in oklahoma city said tuesday 
it gives us a video map of the airport on the radar screen 
bartanowicz said it can paint runways ramp areas and pickup 
targets such as trucks and aircraft 
it will especially be useful during periods of low 
visibility he said 
detroit which doesnt have ground radar is among the first 10 
cities scheduled to receive the airport surface detection equipment 
3 sometime after march he said 
a collision between two jetliners on a detroit runway monday 
killed eight people and injured 24 others a transcript obtained by 
nbc indicated the pilot of one plane told an air traffic controller 
moments before the accident that he was lost in the fog 
bartanowicz said the faa currently is testing the system in 
pittsburgh 
these are highly reliable and much better much improved 
bartanowicz said its a good way of directing surface traffic 
he said tests on the model in pittsburgh are not complete but 
the faa academy is set to receive one for training in march 1991 
he said other models will be installed in airports sometime after 
that

defense secretary dick cheney will ask 
nato allies for more help in transporting american troops to the 
persian gulf region a us official said today 
the official said the appeal would be made at a twoday defense 
ministers meeting starting thursday 
the official cited a need for planes and ships to bring more 
american troops and their gear to the gulf for help in 
transporting us troops through european ports and also for more 
chemicalwarfare protective gear 
all of them the allies have made some contributions to the 
effort in the gulf said the official but he said more help is 
needed for this massive undertaking 
we have some requirements that have already been presented and 
not all have been met said the official who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
we need chemical warfare suits we have received some 
notably from the germans the british and some of the arab forces 
need them as well said the official 
there are now about 300000 us troops in the persian gulf 
region a number that is to increase to more than 400000 in the 
next weeks 
about 100000 american troops are being transported from europe 
today natos european defense ministers met to discuss the 
prospect of war in the gulf and a new conventional and nuclear 
defense strategy for the allies to reflect a new eastwest 
relationship 
cheney and canadian defense minister bill mcknight join them 
thursday for two more days of talks on the same issues 
the meeting comes one week after the adoption of the un 
resolution authorizing military action against iraq unless it 
leaves kuwait by jan 15 almost six months after it invaded and 
annexed its small neighbor 
in all forces from 27 nations are lined up against iraq all 16 
nato allies except turkey luxembourg iceland and germany have 
sent forces to the gulf region 
in recent weeks washington issued two separate appeals to its 
allies for help in flying and shipping american forces to the gulf 
while the response has been generally good officials said more 
help was needed in view of the scope of the us military buildup 
nato will not specify the contribution each of the allies has 
made to date for fear that providing such a breakdown would 
generate friction within the alliance

the opposition today selected the chief 
justice of the supreme court to head a caretaker government 
meeting president hussain muhammad ershads condition for 
resigning 
thousands of people poured into the streets to celebrate 
ershads dramatic resignation announcement tuesday night several 
thousand people assembled at dhaka airport demanding that 
authorities prevent ershad or other government officials from 
fleeing 
in the northern town of rajshahi a student leader was killed 
and two other people were wounded by security guards when they 
marched on the home of a highranking state official 
ershad a 60yearold former army general capitulated to the 
oppositions intense sevenweek campaign to oust him and said he 
would step down as soon as the opposition agreed on a candidate to 
replace him 
chief justice shahabuddin ahmeds candidacy was expected to sail 
through parliament on saturday with ershads support said 
opposition leader khaleda zia sheik hasina another top opposition 
leader confirmed the choice 
jubilant opposition leaders appealed for calm today for the 
first time speeches by the two women who had led the long struggle 
to unseat ershad were broadcast on statecontrolled media 
we have initiated the path of victory for democracy we must 
take the movement to its final victory ms hasina leader of the 
opposition awami league said in a recorded speech 
the autocratic regime has fallen now is the time to display 
restraint and maintain peace to take our movement for democracy to 
a total victory said mrs zia head of the bangladesh 
nationalist party 
mrs zia and ms hasina also warned the president of the 
peoples wrath if he reneges on his promise to quit 
addressing a rally of 50000 cheering and chanting followers 
ms hasina warned that the effort to unseat ershad was not over 
although ershad announced that he had resigned in fact he is 
still in power she said 
she called for immediate dissolution of the cabinet and handing 
over power to a neutral caretaker government 
ershad is conspiring to stay in power mrs zia said let 
there be no doubt that people will fight until they have achieved 
the victory and ousted the autocratic government 
seizing power in a bloodless coup in 1982 ershad governed under 
martial law for four years then quit the army and staged an 
election in 1986 which observers agreed was rigged 
the drive to force ershads resignation began after he said he 
would seek reelection in june the opposition insisted that a fair 
vote would be impossible unless he handed over power to a neutral 
administrator 
shahabuddins confirmation as vice president would clear the way 
for him to succeed ershad in compliance with bangladeshs 
constitution 
once in office the caretaker government would likely dissolve 
parliament making new elections possible the opposition parties 
boycotted previous elections saying ershad would have rigged the 
voting against them 
if ershads replacement is chosen by the opposition and approved 
by parliament it will be the first peaceful transition of power in 
bangladesh 
the campaign for ershads ouster had mushroomed in recent weeks 
with doctors university professors some of ershads 
parliamentarians and civil servants resigning in solidarity with 
the opposition 
last week ershad imposed a state of emergency in an attempt to 
crush the movement the army was called out to counter street 
protests and the opposition claimed at least 100 political 
activists were shot and killed 
this morning scores of victory processions paraded through the 
streets of dhaka unhindered by police the houses of ershads 
ministers were under extra guard by troops 
mobs attacked four ministers residences and the offices of 
ershads jatiya party after his announcement 
ershad canceled all appointments and remained at his home deep 
inside dhakas wellguarded military cantonment according to an 
aide who spoke on condition of anomymity 
he is still in charge of the government the senior minister 
in his cabinet said other sources said the armed forces were still 
taking orders from ershad 
ms hasina combined forces with mrs zia in october to renew the 
pressure on ershad to quit previous efforts to unseat him were 
undermined by the rivalry between the two women 
ms hasina is the daughter of sheik mujibur rahman bangladeshs 
first president mrs zia is the widow of ziaur rehman another 
former president both men were assassinated 
bangladesh has had nine presidents since it gained independence 
in 1971 and all have taken over after assassinations or military 
coups 
though ershad gave bangladesh a measure of political stability 
he made little headway in alleviating the misery of his people 
bangladesh one of the poorest nations in the world has more 
than 107 million people it is bordered by india burma and the bay 
of bengal

nasa tried to get its troublesome 
150 million observatory working right today as more and more 
stargazing time evaporated on columbias scientific mission 
already set back by four years of delays 
astronautastronomers ron parise and robert parker got in 36 
percent of the observation time planned for their 12hour shift 
that ended this morning nasa said that compares to 17 percent in 
the crews previous work period and none before that 
among the targets viewed today was a galaxy 41 million light 
years away that is believed to contain a black hole and crab 
nebula a remnant of a supernova that occurred more than 900 years 
ago 
were trying as hard as we can parise told ground 
controllers 
ten percent of the astro observatorys 230 planned celestial 
targets could have to be scrapped because of the trouble with its 
automatic aiming systems nasa scientist ted gull said tuesday 
it could be several days before the observatory aboard the 
shuttle is working at peak efficiency gull said 
after a day of problems monday columbias astronauts reported 
early tuesday that the observatorys instrument pointing system 
appeared to be working properly 
the system which automatically aims astros three ultraviolet 
telescopes developed glitches later in the day before it was 
coaxed back into operation early today 
problems persisted however through the morning spacelab 
mission operations controls john david bartoe at one point 
informed the astronauts that this is by far the most stable 
pointing weve seen so far 
except that the target isnt in the telescope replied 
parise 
new software later was transmitted to correct the sensitivity of 
one of the instrument pointing systems three star trackers 
finetuning of the system was expected to continue through the day 
the observatory also has an xray telescope which has its own 
pointing system and is controlled by computer commands from the 
ground the telescope unexpectedly fell out of alignment tuesday 
night but ground controllers corrected the problem today and got 
the instrument operating again clusters of galaxies were observed 
its sort of a continuing story nothings quite right yet 
said arthur davidsen of johns hopkins university principal 
investigator for one of the ultraviolet telescopes 
the astronauts used the ultraviolet telescopes pointing system 
to spot a few targets tuesday but they sometimes had to aim the 
telescopes manually a less precise and more timeconsuming 
operation the manual operation was not always successful either 
trouble with the pointing system has cost scientists valuable 
stargazing time forcing to them to drop some lowpriority targets 
from their list 
columbias 10day mission is the first shuttle flight in five 
years dedicated entirely to scientific research 
columbias mission was scheduled to fly in 1986 but was 
postponed because of the challenger explosion the flight also was 
delayed for six months this year because of shuttle hydrogen leaks 
and other problems 
the equipment problems have frustrated scientists who have been 
anxious to use the observatory to study xrays and ultraviolet rays 
that cannot penetrate earths atmosphere 
davidsen said he remained optimistic 
i would be surprised if they could not conquer this problem 
within the next day or so he said tuesday night if they can 
conquer it by today and we can do excellent observations until 
the end of the mission we can recover very nicely the instruments 
are showing us that if we can point at these targets were going 
to get spectacular data 
also on tuesday the astronauts twice spotted the soviet mir 
space station mir was orbiting with five men 32 miles above 
columbia which is carrying seven astronauts in an orbit 218 miles 
above earth

one of bolivias most prominent 
businessmen was shot to death today by his leftist guerrilla 
kidnappers during a shoot out with police trying to rescue him 
authorities said 
jorge lonsdale the owner of the countrys cocacola 
distributorship and other properties was kidnapped in june by 
members of the nestor paz zamora commando movement the leftist 
group is responsible for a string of recent terror attacks 
including the bombing of a us marine residence 
interior minister guillermo capobianco said negotiations for 
lonsdales release were under way between his family and the 
captors when fighting broke out early today between the guerrillas 
and troops surrounding their hideout 
he said preliminary reports indicated that lonsdale was shot in 
the head by michael northtufster an italian who is one of the 
groups leaders capobianco said northtufster was then killed in 
the shootout with police and soldiers 
two other guerrillas also were killed in the exchange of 
gunfire and three were captured capobianco said 
he said several policemen were injured in the fighting 
the nestor paz zamora group takes its name from the late brother 
of bolivias current president jaime paz zamora nestor paz zamora 
launched an unsuccessful guerrilla movement in bolivia in 1970 the 
year before his brother founded the revolutoonary left movement 
currently the governing party 
the nestor paz zamora group claimed responsibility for a bomb 
attack on oct 11 on a us marine residence in la paz a bolivian 
policeman guarding the building was killed and a statue of john f 
kennedy was destroyed 
police said several members of the commando group detained in 
connection with the october bombing were linked to the lonsdale 
kidnapping they said police discovered a small wooden cage used to 
imprison lonsdale in one of two safe houses where the kidnapped 
businessman was held 
lonsdale one of bolivias most affluent entrepreneurs headed a 
major bolivian soccer team and was part owner of a la paz daily la 
razon 
the kidnappers initially demanded 8 million in ransom for 
lonsdales release but family members said they lowered the demand 
to 500000 tuesday the family had planned to pay the ransom 
through a catholic church leader 
capobianco told reporters the police decided to intervene today 
and attempt a rescue when they grew concerned the guerrillas 
intended to kill lonsdale he did not elaborate 
but a leftist legislator gregorio lanza who watched the 
confrontation disputed capobiancos account i want to denounce 
before the country that the government did not keep its promise of 
a truce with the kidnappers thirty policemen took part in the 
operation lanza said 
authorities said northtufster 29 the commando leader who was 
killed in the shootout was a native of bolzano italy they said 
he arrived in bolivia in 1982 to work with the poor and became a 
jesuit seminarian they said he broke off his religious studies to 
study sociology at la paz university and it was not known when he 
joined the guerrilla group

president corazon aquinos government 
today raised fuel prices by more than 45 percent and congressional 
and labor leaders warned that new strikes and unrest would result 
mrs aquino said the government had no choice but to increase 
prices because of soaring costs for crude oil since iraq invaded 
kuwait in august 
although an increase had been expected the size of it stunned 
the public the price increase was considerably more than requested 
by the three oil companies 
long lines formed at gasoline stations as motorists sought to 
beat the 6 pm price change leaders of the two major labor 
federations called emergency meetings to consider a general strike 
god have mercy on those who made this decision said sen 
ernesto maceda a leading critic of other recent fuel price 
increases this is a most painful most stinging and baseless 
decision 
in an announcement only two hours before the increases took 
effect the energy regulatory board raised premium gasoline from 31 
cents to 57 cents a liter the price of liquefied petroleum gas 
widely used in cooking was increased by about 50 percent 
smaller but substantial increases were mandated for all other 
grades of petroleum including diesel aviation fuel and kerosene 
fuel price increases in 1987 and 1989 were followed quickly by 
major coup attempts against mrs aquino the last fuel price rises 
in september led to a nationwide strike by leftwing unions 
consumer prices for fuel are subsidized by the government the 
philippines imports virtually all its petroleum and increases in 
crude oil prices have strained the governments hardcurrency 
reserves 
in a televised statement mrs aquino claimed she had no 
authority to influence decisions of the energy regulatory board 
although it is directly subordinate to her office 
she urged the board to reduce the increases for kerosene 
petroleum gas and diesel and to transfer them to other categories 
of petroleum that will not affect so much our poor countrymen 
several cabinet members appeared to have been caught by surprise 
by the announcement labor secretary ruben torres said he was 
shocked 
transport secretary oscar orbos urged reporters to tone down 
critical reports about the price increase to help the 
president 
sources at some newspapers controlled by the government said 
editors were told by mrs aquinos staff to refrain from critical 
remarks about the price increase

solidarity leader lech walesa has widened 
his lead over darkhorse challenger stanislaw tyminski four days 
before the final presidential vote according to an independent 
poll published today 
in another boost for walesa us defense secretary richard b 
cheney met with the solidarity leader today in gdansk and wished 
him victory and success in the runoff election 
i have certain political experience and i feel that i have 
talked today with the man who will win cheney a former 
congressman told walesa in the presence of reporters at the end of 
their 40minute meeting at solidarity headquarters in gdansk 
i wish you victory and success in this difficult task he 
said 
tyminski had claimed during a rally tuesday that he was invited 
to meet with cheney but turned down the invitation 
a us source said tyminski was on the guest list for an embassy 
reception for cheney but that no special meeting was planned 
in the poll 61 percent of those questioned supported walesa and 
20 percent backed tyminski the remaining 19 percent were 
undecided according to the survey conducted by the private polling 
service demoskop and commissioned by the governmentowned newspaper 
rzeczpospolita 
an opinion poll conducted a week ago by state television put 
walesas support at 58 percent and tyminskis at 30 percent 
a polish emigre businessman who says he made a fortune in peru 
and canada tyminski returned to his native land in september and 
scored a stunning secondplace finish in the first round of voting 
on nov 25 his victory forced prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
out of the race 
the poll published today was based on a survey of 988 people 
across the nation and conducted on tuesday no margin for error was 
given 
at a news conference on tuesday tyminski said his own soundings 
showed him trailing walesa 44 percent to 50 percent with his 
support growing by 15 percent daily 
today tyminski campaign officials denied a claim made in a 
report on polish television that he had beaten his wife and refused 
to give food and medicine to his children in canada last year 
the charge was made in a taped interview broadcast late tuesday 
by a woman identified only as clara fox 
the information has nothing in common with the truth said 
campaign spokeswoman agnieska majewska 
tyminksi acknowledged an acquaintance with the foxes but said 
it was only slight 
mr fox visited us two times and i threw him out because he 
acted in an uncultured way tyminski said he behaved in a very 
uncatholic way he insulted my wife and was thrown out 
tyminski has promised to quickly improve polands economy and 
has blamed many of its problems on walesa and mazowiecki who heads 
polands first noncommunist government in more than four decades 
but tyminski has also been criticized for his leadership of the 
fringe libertarian party of canada his advocacy of nuclear weapons 
and his long absence from poland

at least 26 states face deficits or budget shortfalls this 
fiscal year nearly all have made spending cuts and face more as 
the economy worsens 
it becomes a political decision do you want to let people out

iraq today began processing exit permits 
for soviet citizens and soviet officials said they were willing to 
discuss compensation for terminating the work contracts of more 
than 3200 soviet citizens 
if there are going to be costs we are prepared to bear those 
costs because we feel that the security and wellbeing of our 
citizens should come first soviet foreign ministry spokesman 
vitaly churkin said in moscow 
iraq demanded the compensation monday when it announced the 
soviet citizens would be freed 
when iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 there were about 8000 
soviet experts in iraq building pipelines working on construction 
projects and advising the iraqi oil industry 
a soviet diplomat in baghdad speaking on condition of 
anonymity said more than 200 exit visas were issued before the 
interior ministry closed for the day 
he said an illyushin il86 jet which can carry up to 400 
passengers was expected to land in baghdad on thursday to pick up 
the first of the departing soviets thursdays flight will stop in 
ankara turkey to be checked for possible contraband in violation 
of un trade sanctions 
aeroflot the soviet unions national carrier currently flies 
smaller planes twice a week to baghdad 
the fivemember command council headed by president saddam 
hussein announced monday it was allowing the soviets to leave the 
decision came five days after moscow once iraqs chief patron 
threatened to send troops to the gulf if iraq did not release 
soviet citizens 
iraq banned foreigners from leaving the country in response to a 
usled military buildup that followed the invasion 
however the soviets in iraq have not been listed among saddams 
other guests the hundreds of americans europeans and 
japanese held hostage or the 600 men held as human shields at 
strategic locations to deter attack 
churkin the soviet foreign ministry spokesman said he did not 
know how much money the soviet union might have to pay to iraq in 
compensation 
we have had an extensive economic relationship with iraq and 
it will have to be seen what kind of balance there exists in our 
transactions with that country he said 
but churkin praised the decision to release the soviet citizens 
moscow expresses satisfaction with the iraqi leaderships 
decision and proceeds from the fact that our people can now leave 
iraq and return home without hindrance 
still churkin said the iraqi move did not lessen moscows 
opposition to the invasion and annexation of kuwait 
our attitude will not change at all he said

nearly one in four us hospitals do not require 
patients consent before testing for aids and one in four do not 
require that a patient be told if the results are positive 
according to a study published today 
the study of 561 hospitals reported in todays issue of the 
journal of he american medical association also concluded that 
twothirds of all the nations hospitals and about 40 percent of 
its rural hospitals have admitted at least one patient with 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
aids is no longer a disease of just 20 cities said dr 
charles e lewis professor of medicine at the university of 
california los angeles and coauthor of the study 
but despite the diseases spread a clear comprehensive policy 
has not been developed by hospitals to protect the rights of 
patients the study concluded 
from the perspective of a potential patient the studys 
researchers wrote the current state of policy provides no 
guarantee that their rights will be protected 
according to the study 22 percent of the nations hospitals do 
not have a policy requiring that they inform patients they will be 
tested for the aids virus and 253 percent of the hospitals do not 
have a policy requiring that patients be told they have tested 
positive for the aids virus 
fiftysix percent of the hospitals have policies requiring that 
aids test results be included in patients records 38 percent 
require that treatment plans be reviewed when patients test 
positive and 3 percent require that patients testing positive be 
discharged or moved to other facilities 
researchers wrote that the discrepancy in policies may be the 
result of the difficulty in trying to create a policy that protects 
both patients and hospital employees as well as guards against 
lawsuits being filed by either group 
not only do hospitals face potential risk of litigation from 
patients for violation of their rights but hospitals also may be 
held responsible for placing health care personnel at increased 
risk by withholding relevant information about infected patients 
the study said

a newspaper today published what it described as a 
whos who of moscow racketeers and a map of city neighborhoods 
controlled by the 10 major criminal groups in the soviet capital 
the weekly commersant business newspaper said it sent a copy of 
its map and stories to moscows internal affairs department for 
comment two days later the department replied that organized 
crime does not exist as such in moscow the newspaper said 
commersant said organized crime controls some or all of moscows 
drug trade prostitution slot machines video arcades and usedcar 
sales but its main business is extracting protection money mostly 
from restaurants and other semiprivate enterprises it said 
whenever the supply of a product is forcibly kept below demand 
such as narcotics in the west or alcohol during prohibition 
organized crime steps in and thrives the newspaper said 
but in a country such as the soviet union where virtually 
everything is difficult to obtain the opportunities for organized 
crime are endless couple that with an overstretched police force 
and you have an explosive situation 
the new soviet interior minister boris pugo said tuesday that 
president mikhail s gorbachev is very concerned with the rise in 
organized crime 
however the struggle with this crime hasnt been effective 
enough so far pugo told the government newspaper izvestia 
he said corruption has penetrated all organizations all 
bodies of power including the highest echelons 
commersant said its picture of moscows underworld was drawn 
from anonymous informants and written by journalists who asked not 
to be identified for fear of gangland retribution 
moscow gangs have grown since 1988 when the two oldest and 
largest groups held a gangster summit to divide the city into 
spheres of influence the newspaper said 
that system soon broke down and now there are more than 10 
major criminal gangs known as teams or brigades with a combined 
membership of about 6000 people commersant said 
it said the assyrian brigade has a monopoly on the illegal drug 
trade and operates out of the central krasnaya presnya district 
home to the moscow zoo and several embassies 
the dolgoprudnay brigade controls northern moscow and leads in 
racketeering particularly extracting protection money commersant 
said 
other gangs control warehouses and hardcurrency restaurants 
blackmarket leather and fur counterfeiting and extortion of vodka 
salesmen the paper said

a former senior police official who 
escaped from prison and then seized national police headquarters 
was captured today by american troops after he fled the building 
the former police official col eduardo herrera hassan walked 
out of the building ringed by a group of policemen loyal to him and 
an estimated 80 journalists who were trying to ask him questions 
the cluster crossed a roadblock manned by american troops and 
herrera who was wearing civilian clothes got away in the 
confusion 
herrera escaped in a car but was captured a short time later at 
a condominium building near the police heaquarters 
several shots were fired and one of herreras supporters was 
wounded about 50 armed men with herrera also gave up after trying 
to flee 
herrera escaped tuesday afternoon from prison on the pacific 
island of nao aboard a private helicopter and took over the police 
headquarters near the panama canal early today 
us troops and panamanian police then took up positions 300 
yards away from the building but both sides held their fire 
before fleeing herrera met with us and panamanian officials 
but it was not immediately known what they discussed 
the us embassy had issued a statement that said in answer 
to a request from the government of panama the united states has 
provided military support to the national police to help in the 
protection of the area around the national police headquarters 
the united states maintains about 12000 troops in panama to 
protect the canal until panama takes it over at the end of the 
century 
the standoff was the first challenge to the nearly yearold 
government of president guillermo endara herrera said he was not 
trying to overthrow the government but gain more respect for the 
police 
the national police force was created after us forces invaded 
last december and toppled gen manuel antonio noriega who is 
jailed in miami awaiting trial on drugtrafficking and 
moneylaundering charges 
herrera a former noriega associate was fired as deputy 
national police chief in august and jailed in october on charges of 
conspiring against the new government 
before fleeing the headquarters herrera claimed to have control 
of panamas police force but it was not known how much support he 
had among police officers 
officials said he tried to take over a police station on the 
outskirts of the city tuesday night but failed he managed to take 
over police headquarters early today 
endara said his government had the support of the majority of 
the countrys police and accused herrera of trying to stage a coup 
herrera allowed reporters into the police headquarters for a 
news conference this morning and said this is a movement that is 
not a military coup 
he said members of the police force felt humiliated and wanted 
me to be their spokesman i came to cooperate in the reconciliation 
of this country no one has been kidnapped no shot has been 
fired 
herrera did not elaborate on the alleged discontent 
there were about 100 men with herrera at the news conference 
some said they were being held against their will herrera said all 
were free to leave 
it was not known if he took any hostages with him when he fled 
the building 
herrera was a member of noriegas panama defense forces but he 
had been on the outs with noriega who forced herrera to leave the 
country by naming him ambassador to israel prior to the us 
invasion 
after ousting noriega the us government installed endara who 
had won popular elections that noriega anulled 
herrera returned to panama and was named deputy police chief in 
january the defense forces were dissolved and replaced with the 
national police which number about 12000 and contain some members 
of the old force 
in describing his escape for reporters herrera said a 
helicopter landed and took me from prison i didnt know who they 
were until the men removed their masks and i realized that they 
were members of the police force 
prison guards fired at the departing helicopter but there were 
n reports of injuries 
a us army officer met with herrera early today but there was 
no indication of what they discussed herrera said he had assured 
the us officer that he did not want bloodshed herrera said he 
also met with panamanian officials to present them with complaints 
of officers 
endara said tuesday night that herrera had tried unsuccessfully 
to seize a police station in the panama city neighborhood of san 
miguelito he called several provinces and we know he failed 
absolutely he called over the national police radio network and he 
got no response endara told a news conference 
officials said herrera apparently visited other police stations 
before arriving by car at the headquarters in panama city early 
today

the navy is sacking a senior commander and 
reassigning two other top officials for failing to inform top 
pentagon leaders of serious setbacks in the development of the a12 
attack aircraft program 
navy secretary h lawrence garrett iii announced the actions 
tuesday as the pentagon released an internal navy report that 
outlined a breakdown in supervision of the 6yearold aircraft 
program 
the a12 avenger stealth bomber is the navys top aircraft 
priority the carrierbased plane is scheduled to begin replacing 
the aging fleet of a6 intruder attack planes in 1995 and to serve 
as a mainstay well into the 21st century 
garrett wrote in a memo to defense secretary dick cheney that 
the navys a12 program supervisors failed to make clear to top 
navy and pentagon leaders last spring that the project was faring 
much worse than the contractor claimed 
the planes development is more than a year behind schedule and 
at least 20 percent over the planned 47 billion cost 
the controversy heated up last june when the contractors 
general dynamics and mcdonnell douglas told the navy they could 
not produce the first plane on time that costs were escalating and 
that certain performance standards for the aircraft could not be 
met 
just a few weeks before that cheney had announced after a 
highlevel pentagon review of the a12 program that it was fully on 
track 
garrett told cheney he was forcing vice adm richard c gentz 
commander of the naval air systems command to retire by next feb 
1 he also said he was reassigning the executive officer for 
tactical aircraft programs rear adm john f calvert and the a12 
program manager capt lawrence g elberfeld 
calvert and elberfeld also received letters of censure from the 
navy secretary although garrett said he would not stop elberfelds 
scheduled promotion to rear admiral 
gentzs office today released a statement he wrote for his 
employees in which the threestar admiral said it was with 
sincere regret that he leaves the navy in which he has served 
since 1957 
the navair team is strong totally competent and most of all 
has the necessary experience and dedication to meet any challenge 
by continuing to work together he wrote 
dennis kline head of the naval air systems command public 
affairs office said today that gentz would not agree to be 
interviewed about garretts action or the a12 program 
an aide in elberfelds office said he was out of town and could 
not be reached for comment and an aide to calvert said the admiral 
would not comment 
a statement issued in cheneys name tuesday said he was troubled 
by the conclusions of a separate a12 investigation by the 
pentagons inpector general cheney ordered deputy defense 
secretary donald atwood to make recommendations for corrective 
action when cheney returns from europe next week 
a central theme of both the internal navy report and the 
pentagon inspector generals investigation is that overly 
optimistic cost and schedule estimates of the contractors were not 
sufficiently challenged by the government the reports also said 
that official secrecy helped mask the projects problems 
the navy report said mcdonnell douglas and general dynamics 
contract officials failed to advise the navy of cost and schedule 
problems they knew existed it said the contract officials felt 
pressured by upper management at their companies to avoid making 
forecasts of cost or schedule overruns since such problems would 
reduce contract payments to the companies 
in its report the inspector generals office cited an instance 
in which general dynamics required government inspectors at the 
companys a12 plant in fort worth texas to turn over their notes 
to review them for security classification one set of notes was 
lost and it later was determined that they had contained no secret 
information anyway 
we question any procedure by which a contractor obtains access 
to and control over the work product of government personnel 
engaged in oversight duties the report said 
the inspector general was highly critical of the role of john a 
betti the undersecretary of defense for acquisition it said he 
put too much credence in assurances by the contractors that the 
project could be completed on time and within the cost ceiling and 
that he dismissed warnings by lowerlevel pentagon officials that 
the project was encountering serious problems 
we find mr bettis failure especially troublesome in view of 
a prior warning within the office of the secretary of defense of 
cost growth on the a12 program inspector general susan j

secretary of state james a baker iii told congress today that 
iraq must get out of kuwait now or risk all israel issued a 
veiled warning to take matters into its own hands if the united 
states fails to act 
iraq today began processing exit permits for more than 3200 
soviet citizens and soviet officials said they were willing to 
discuss compensation for terminating the soviets work contracts 
as iraq demanded 
the united states meanwhile was preparing to seek more help 
from nato allies in transporting troops to the persian gulf and 
the philippines government increased fuel prices by nearly 50 
percent as a result of rising prices brought on by the gulf crisis 
bakers appearance before the senate foreign relations committee 
came as lawmakers stepped up demands for a role in any decision to 
attack iraqi troops many on capitol hill have also been pressing 
the bush administration to pledge more time for economic sanctions 
to work 
but baker told lawmakers the unimposed embargo has had 
little if any effect on iraqs inclination to withdraw 
congress and the american people must tell saddam hussein in 
unmistakable actions and words get out of kuwait now or risk 
all 
president bush on a visit to south america said he disagreed 
with those who believe that sanctions should be given up to 18 
months to work 
ive not been one whos been convinced that sanctions alone 
will bring him saddam to his senses bush said tuesday in 
uruguay 
bush was wrapping up the trip in argentina today in buenos 
aires while greeting diplomats at the presidential palace he was 
approached by the iraqi ambassador to argentina sahibhussain 
tahir a grimfaced bush gave tahir a quick formal handshake 
without exchanging a word 
in israel there was increasing concern about how firmly the 
united states was prepared to act against iraq 
an israeli newspaper haaretz said today that israel has 
tacitly warned the united states that it will feel free to deal 
with the iraqi military threat if the united states doesnt 
israeli officials said the report went too far but stressed 
they were watching bushs latest diplomatic moves in the gulf 
very carefully 
iraq has accepted bushs offer to send baker to baghdad and to 
receive iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz in washington 
on the timing of that meeting a member of the palestine 
liberation organizations executive committee yasser abedrabbo 
told radio france internationale today that bush would meet with 
aziz on dec 17 
white house spokesman bill harlow said no specific date had been 
set for the aziz meeting bush had said it would take place the 
week of dec 10 
meanwhile oil prices fell and stocks rallied on a report that 
iraq is willing to withdraw from kuwait if allowed to keep a 
disputed section of a borderstraddling oil field 
britains sky television news said saddam was proposing to 
relinquish all of kuwait but the southern end of the rumailah oil 
field 
iraqs ambassador to the united states mohammed almashat was 
asked today about the british report 
i havent heard that but all i can say is negotiations 
involve give and take i let you conclude what it means he said 
in an interview on cbs 
the bush administration has been under mounting pressure from 
congress not to act unilaterally in the persian gulf house 
democrats voted 17737 in caucus tuesday for a nonbinding 
resolution telling bush he must first get permission from congress 
before sending troops into battle 
the administration is also seeking dismissal of a lawsuit by 54 
democratic members of congress that seeks an injunction forcing 
bush to seek congressional approval before attacking iraqi forces 
the resolution calls for the authorization except to protect 
american lives from imminent endangerment 
lawyers for the plaintiffs argued tuesday the us district 
court in washington should tell the president not be snubbing his 
nose at congress 
the unordered trade embargo has cut off most of iraqs oil 
exports and imports of food and weapons 
in moscow soviet foreign ministry spokesman said moscow was 
willing to discuss compensation payments for iraq for allowing 
soviet citizens to leave before their work contracts expired 
if there are going to be costs we are prepared to bear those 
costs because we feel that the security and wellbeing of our 
citizens should come first churkin said 
a soviet diplomat in baghdad said more than 200 exit visas were 
issued today and some freed soviets were to fly out on thursday 
economic effects of the gulf crisis are being felt far beyond 
iraq 
philippines president corazon aquinos government today raised 
fuel prices by more than 45 percent because of the soaring cost of 
crude oil long gas lines formed in the hours before the price 
inrease took effect 
word that the united states will seek trooptransport help came 
from a us official in brussels who said today that defense 
secretary dick cheney will ask nato allies for more help during a 
twoday meeting starting thursday 
the official cited a need for planes and ships to bring more 
american troops and their gear to the gulf for help in 
transporting us troops through european ports and also for more

the european community was given a 
deadline of noon thursday to draw up a new proposal for sharper 
cuts in agriculture subsidies that would rescue deadlocked world 
trade talks officials said today 
uruguayan foreign minister hector gros espiell imposed the 
deadline after a series of meetings to try to find a way to move 
forward the stalled uruguay round of trade negotiations 
the negotiations kicked off in 1986 in the uruguayan resort of 
punta del este are designed to overhaul world trade in 15 areas 
including agriculture manufactured goods textiles and services 
such as telecommunications transportation and banking 
they are sponsored by the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade the world trade regulatory body 
but the european communitys hardline opposition to cuts in 
farm subsidies has threatened the 107nation uruguay round the 
most wideranging attempt ever to reduce trade barriers 
in response to the deadline ec trade negotiators gave differing 
signals as to how flexible europe was prepared to be on the farming 
issue 
were ready to move by noon tomorrow said hugo paemen a 
senior negotiator for the 12nation trading bloc the ec is 
discussing new agriculture proposals as well as proposals in other 
areas 
but ray macsharry the communitys top farm official who has 
been among the most intransigent negotiators said our degree of 
flexibility is minimal 
a lot of contracting partners need to rethink not just the 
european community the ec cannot be expected to give in on 
everything he told reporters 
the talks stalled tuesday amid heavy pressure from the united 
states and other countries to substantially reduce subsidies for 
european farmers who are among the worlds most heavily 
subsidized 
in october the united states proposed cuts in farm subsidies 
ranging from 75 percent to 90 percent over the next decade export 
subsidies designed to promote sales overseas were targeted for the 
deepest slashes 
the european community so far has offered to snip only 30 
percent from subsidies for major crops over 10 years beginning in 
1986 some reductions already have been made prompting us 
critics to contend that much less than 30 percent would occur in 
the next five years 
france and germany have been the most resistant to deep cuts in 
farm supports the german government had been worried about the 
farmers vote in last sundays elections 
australian prime minister bob hawke said today he was 
imploring german chancellor helmut kohl and french president 
francois mitterrand to inject the political will and the courage 
which is obviously necessary to prevent a debacle in these 
negotiations 
there have been hints of cracks in the communitys position 
opposing any but the most modest reductions britain the 
netherlands and surprisingly germany have urged more flexibility 
the uruguay round is the eighth in a series of negotiating 
sessions since world war ii designed to reduce barriers to world 
trade 
the general agreement on tariffs and trade was established in 
1947 as a forum for promoting free trade

the socalled keating five senators applied 
pressure on regulators in support of probably the worst 
institution in america charles h keating jrs lincoln savings 
and loan a federal regulator said today 
william k black testifying before the senate ethics 
committees public hearings asserted that one result of the 
senators pressure was to delay enforcement actions against lincoln 
ultimately leading to greater losses for taxpayers 
black described as improper a request that one of the senators 
dennis deconcini of arizona made in a disputed april 9 1987 
meeting the senators held with regulators 
deconcini asked the regulators to waive a rule that would limit 
lincolns ability to make direct investments and would have the 
effect of exposing the thrift to direct regulatory control 
this is an institution that is probably the worst institution 
in america and instead of people trying to help bring it under 
control five us senators were pushing us in the opposite 
direction black said it was startlingly the wrong 
direction 
black a senior deputy counsel with the federal home loan bank 
board generally supported the earlier testimony of two other 
regulators that deconcini an arizona democrat sought to have the 
regulators waive a rule limiting lincolns ability to make risky 
direct investments and that he used the word we suggesting he 
was speaking for all the senators 
none of the other senators said they differed he said 
but black went beyond previous testimony to assert that he 
believed political pressure from the senators led to later actions 
by the bank board that allowed lincoln to significantly expand its 
junk bonds and direct investments 
this led to greatly increased losses for the federal 
insurance fund initially and the taxpayers eventually he said 
blacks testimony touched off a flurry of objections from 
defense attorneys for some of the five senators 
we had found a massive violation of a rule that was vital to 
safety and soundness of the institution and we were being asked 
not to take any enforcement action and to allow that violation to 
continue black said 
i felt it was intimidating and i felt charles keating had 
clearly set up the meetings to be intimidating black said 
under questioning by special counsel robert s bennett black 
described a disputed april 9 1987 meeting he and three other 
federal regulators held with the five senators under scrutiny 
black said the regulators had found massive problems at lincoln 
including the use of an accounting scam to produce paper 
profits and send big dividends to a parent shell company run by 
keating his family and associates 
regulators had also found evidence of filestuffing or the 
insertion of phony documents in an attempt to support millions of 
dollars in loans for the benefit of examiners after the money had 
been committed 
keatings institution ultimately collapsed and was seized by the 
government april 14 1989 the cost to taxpayers of paying off 
insured deposits has been put at more than 2 billion 
we call it a scam black said i think most people do 
black took detailed notes in the meeting he and three san 
franciscobased regulators held with the five senators 
the five senators are under investigation for allegations they 
improperly intervened with regulators on behalf of keating at a 
time when keating and his associates were contributing 13 million 
to their campaigns and causes 
on tuesday m danny wall former chairman of the old federal 
home loan bank board said he called sen alan cranston dcalif 
to tell him when californiabased lincoln was seized on april 14 
1989 
he said something to the effect i think the board has made a 
mistake i hope you are right wall said 
the regulator said he responded we had no choice 
bennett has used blacks notes to corroborate regulators 
testimony that one of the senators dennis deconcini dariz 
offered the government a deal in return for concessions for 
keating 
wall said he called cranston after the senator had contacted him 
four times in three months on keatings behalf and several other 
times over three years 
it was an unusual degree of involvement by a senator in the 
affairs of one institution wall said but he contended it was not 
improper 
besides cranston and deconcini the senators under scrutiny are 
republican john mccain of arizona and democrats john glenn of ohio 
and donald riegle of michigan 
wall testified that deconcini contacted him at least twice ad 
cranston four times to urge that regulators permit keatings thrift 
to be sold rather than taken over by the government 
two years before the seizure in the meeting where black took 
notes regulators told the senators that criminal referrals on 
lincoln were being forwarded to the justice department testimony 
in the hearings has shown that only cranston and deconcini 
contacted the bank board after that 
the two senators have said they contacted wall about a sale 
because they were trying to save jobs at lincoln and its parent 
company american continental corp 
wall said cranston urged prompt consideration and approval of 
any legitimate proposals for the sale of lincoln while deconcini 
sought prompt consideration but did not urge approval of any 
proposal 
he said he did not recall discussing the details of any of the 
proposals with the senators 
all three proposed buyers were rejected because they were not 
armslength transactions and keating was involved on both sides 
of the deal wall said none of the proposed deals would make 
lincoln economically viable he said 
under questioning by sen jesse helms rnc an ethics panel 
member wall said none of the senators pressured him

former president reagan said today 
that sovie president mikhail s gorbachev might resort to martial 
law to prevent his countrys economic crisis from leading to 
anarchy 
describing gorbachev as a friend and a friend in need 
reagan said gorbachev is torn between people who want to move 
faster on reforms and entrenched bureaucrats who are blocking his 
path 
with production and the soviet gross national product 
declining will the people be patient long enough for the reforms 
to work we must hope so for the alternatives are not desirable 
reagan said 
it is conceivable that president gorbachev will feel the need 
to invoke some of his more drastic powers using the army and the 
kgb to impose and maintain martial law reagan said 
if he does so i believe it would not be from some powermad 
impulse but rather from a belief that such an action would be the 
only way to save his nation from instability 
reagan making the only public address of his fiveday visit in 
england spoke at the cambridge union debating society he was 
warmly received by more than 500 students and faculty 
if the peacefultransition scenario does not succeed and if 
the martial law scenario is played out and fails to push the 
transition forward the socalled worse case may result this would 
involve chaos civil strife perhaps anarchy and widespread famine 
the spillover from such an upheaval would become everyones 
business 
there would be millions of starving refuges and there would be 
uncertainty about the control of the remaining nuclear weapons 
deployed about the soviet countryside 
for all these reasons we in the west must make every effort to 
understand the current transition we must understand the tension 
between and among the various nationalities within the ussr and we 
must assist the people of that vast land in making the transition 
to democracy and a market economy as peacefully as possible he 
said 
a few demonstrators were outside the debating chamber two of 
them protesting us policy in guatemala one student had a grocery 
shopping cart rigged up with a bicycle wheel strung with tinsel 
labeled reagans brain 
inside however reagan was greeted with a burst of applause as 
he slowly walked in nodding to the main floor and the jammed 
galleries

women are twic as likely as men to experience 
depression a major public health problem that costs the united 
states 16 billion a year officials said today 
the american psychological association said patterns of 
thinking physical and sexual abuse poverty and unhappy marriages 
are all woven into a complex tapestry that puts women at double the 
risk for depression 
bonnie strickland an amherst professor of psychology and past 
president of the apa called depression a major public health 
problem that costs the country about 16 billion a year and leads 
to about 30000 suicides a year 
unfortunately its often not recognized and untreated 
strickland said at a news conference 
the pattern of depression she said seems to be occurring more 
and more often among young adults shifting away from the 
middleaged who were once the major victims and though depression 
occurs at some time in the life in one out of every eight men the 
disorder strikes 25 percent of all women strickland said 
a threeyear study by a committee of experts organized by the 
apa found that at least 7 million american women suffer from 
depression and that most will go untreated often with tragic 
unnecessary losses such as suicide 
women truly are more depressed than men primarily due to their 
experience of being female in our contemporary culture ellen 
mcgrath chairwoman of the national task force on women and 
depression said in a statement prepared for a news conference 
today 
the study said more research is essential to determine why women 
are so vulnerable to the ailment how best to treat it and how best 
to help women protect themselves from the dangers of profound 
depression 
mcgrath said the task force found that women of all races ages 
and income levels in europeafrica and north america are all at 
higher risk than men for most types of depression and said 
mcgrath the reason is not that women are more apt to admit their 
feelings 
it is astonishing how often this difference is denied by 
assuming that women more readily report emotional distress than 
men she said this argument says women are not really more 
depressed they just say and think so 
the report by the task force said a number of social economic 
biological and emotional factors raise the risk of depression for 
women consequently the experts said women and their depression 
should be studied in a biopsychosocial context that recognizes 
the varied effects of gender differences in all these factors 
among the task force findings 
biology is not as strong an influence in womens depression as 
previously believed menstruation pregnancy abortion and 
menopause are not major factors in significant depression for most 
women infertility is however with up to 40 percent of women 
studied saying the inability to conceive is the most upsetting 
experience of their lives 
depression in women may be related to genderrelated 
personality styles that include passive dependent patterns and 
negative thinking but this requires more research 
the research suggests women focus too much on discussing 
depressed feelings instead of developing action and mastery 
strategies mcgrath said 
abuse early in life may play a large role the study said that 
between 37 percent and half of all women have had a significant 
experience of physical or sexual abuse before the age of 21 for 
many women depression may be the result of posttraumatic stress 
syndrome or even undiagnosed head trauma from battering 
unhappy marriages and parenthood are important factors the 
study said women are three times more likely than men to be 
depressed in unhappy marriages and that having young children 
around creates a vulnerability to depression the more children 
in the house the more depression is reported the study said 
the report called poverty a pathway to depression it said 
that 75 percent of the us poor are women and children 
some groups of women are particularly susceptible the report 
said these include minority elderly chemically dependent 
lesbian and professional women it said these need special 
attention and support 
although depression now readily yields to treatment in 80 to 90 
percent of all patients most women with the ailment go untreated 
the report said and for those who are treated the depression is 
misdiagnosed at least 30 to 50 percent of the time it said 
approximately 70 percent of the prescriptions for 
antidepressants are given to women often with improper diagnosis 
and monitoring the study said it recommended more research on 
the use of antidepressant drugs for women 
the apa task force included 34 women and five men the group 
included psychologists physicians mental health workers authors 
and editors and rep patricia schroeder dcolo

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the 
united states and abroad 
 
nov 29 
the westerly ri sun on the persian gulf 
it would be impossible to imagine that the bush administration 
did not know what it was doing when it chose or agreed to jan 15 
as dday in the persian gulf 
jan 15 is the day by which saddam hussein must remove his 
patriots from kuwait or see the middle east explode into a cauldron 
of disaster 
but jan 15 is a day with more than passing importance in the 
united states in fact the choice of jan 15 as a date of 
ultimatum for war could hardly have been more ironic 
jan 15 is martin luther king day martin luther king jr was 
americas gandhi more than any other patriot he represents 
nonviolent confrontation and the peaceful resolution of nearly 
irreconcilable differences it was his disarming technique of 
aggression that ended the timeless supremacy of institutional 
racism in the south 
to supplant this day of peace with a day celebrating the threat 
of annihilation by fire is an injustice and a terribly sad 
commentary on the times it does not bode well for a peaceful 
solution to the invasion of kuwait 
 
dec 2 
the flint mich journal on the persian gulf 
it is our hope that the united nations security council 
resolution authorizing the use of force against iraq will result in 
peace not war 
president bush has done the right thing in securing the worlds 
approval for the use of force should that option become necessary 
we strongly support the resolution because we believe that if 
saddam hussein understands anything it is force 
still we remain convinced that force should be used against 
iraq only when it is clear all other nonviolent options have been 
exhausted and so we applaud president bushs announcement to 
send secretary of state james baker iii to iraq and his invitation 
to iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz to come to washington for 
consultations 
the biggest potential problem we have with the un resolution 
is its deadline we understand the need for a deadline the world 
cannot go on tolerating saddams belligerence forever he has 
already defiantly ignored 10 previous un resolutions demanding 
iraqs unconditional and immediate withdrawal from kuwait and 
release of all hostages 
but just because the un resolution allows the use of force 
after jan 15 we hope the bush administration does not interpret 
that to mean the united states must or even should initiate war on 
jan 16 
 
nov 27 
the union leader manchester nh on the persian gulf 
as we face the stalemate in the middle east has the time come 
to consider use of our ultimate weapon that is the nuclear 
weapon 
if it is determined that the sole means of ridding the world of 
saddam husseins own nuclear threat is through force then it 
would be foolish not to consider the most effective and lifesaving 
means of that force 
nuclear weapons saved thousands of lives that would have been 
lost in a protracted war against the japanese 
some will think this an ugly solution but then war is ugly in 
itself a lengthy war which would spill the blood of american boys 
across the desert sands would be the ugliest of all 
 
dec 2 
wilmington nc sunday starnews on the persian gulf 
president bush doesnt have the patience to strangle saddam 
hussein he is risking war instead 
he is risking war even though public support for war is 
dwindling and some top military experts say it might not be 
necessary that given a year or so the blockade of iraq could 
force saddam out of kuwait 
that was supposed to have been the plan when the president sent 
our young people to the gulf in late summer they were sent to keep 
sddam from overrunning saudi arabia 
the refusal of other countries to trade with iraq was going to 
bankrupt and starve saddam into submission 
it might have worked theres reason to think the american 
people would have had the patience to sit it out considering the 
bloody alternative a long wait isnt such a bad thing 
the president got the united nations security council to approve 
a resolution authorizing americans to die possibly by the tens of 
thousands for the new world order 
if congress were willing to play its proper role it would be 
stampeding back to washington to let the president know he has 
sprinted too far out on the limb that has us all on it 
but with the exception of sen sam nunn and a few others most 
lawmakers democrats and republicans alike lack the nerve to 
oppose the president not that many of them are keen on supporting 
him you understand theyd rather lie low and hope they wont get 
blamed for whatever happens 
 
dec 1 
albany ore democratherald on the persian gulf 
the bush administration was wondering whether to call 
congress into session on the persian gulf situation it should do 
so without delay 
congress should be asked to act on a resolution that would 
authorize the use of force against iraq unless that country meets 
certain conditions one condition would be the release of all 
american hostages by a deadline another would be complete 
withdrawal from kuwait 
such a resolution would not be the same as a declaration of war 
but it would be close enough 
as commanderinchief the president has the power to move 
troops and even to amass units in saudi arabia as he has done but 
theres grave doubt whether he can send them into battle without 
congressional consent when the united states is not under attack 
and there is no other emergency 
congress often comes across as a collection of craven kooks 
still its part of our constitutional government and has a role to 
play the security council of the united nations has authorized the 
use of force if iraq doesnt leave kuwait by jan 15 this is 
helpful from the standpoint of diplomacy but a un resolution 
means zip when it comes to the american constitution 
if iraq attacks our units in saudi arabian need no act of 
congress to defend themselves but if its our side that shoots 
first congressional action is required before the bloodshed 
starts

the independent deputy chairman of 
parliament is likely to head a new coalition government following 
the resignation of premier andrei lukanovs socialist cabinet 
parliament sources said today

reached in consultations between the majority socialists and

distribution of ministries between the socialists and opposition 
parties and the dates of regional and parliamentary elections

of peaceful transition 
other candidates mentioned were two independent university 
professors blagovest sendov and petar dinekov 
the new cabinet is to include three deputy premiers and 11 
ministers for a total of 15 government posts down from 22 in the

delaware county daily times chester pa on middle east 
hostages 
a nation that chooses not to pursue freedom for an innocent 
captive resigns its own freedom those who choose not to listen 
will themselves cry out and never be heard 
this excerpt was taken from a postcard one of about 450000 
that were mailed to the white house as part of a campaign to show 
the administration that the american public cares about hostages 
and hostagetaking should not be tolerated 
but these cards were not intended to address the current hostage 
situation 
the cards were mailed in 1989 a year before the average joe 
ever heard about saddam hussein and what a madman he is the 
postcard campaign was intended to rekindle the passions across the 
land when americans first became targets of terrorist attacks 
the cards were meant to reignite hope for the other hostages 
our country has all but forgotten terry anderson who has been 
held captive in the middle east since march 16 1985 
we can only vaguely remember him and the other lost hostages 
joseph james cicippio who has been held hostage since sept 
12 1986 thomas sutherland who was captured june 9 1985 edward 
austin tracy oct 21 1986 jesse turner jan 24 1987 alann 
steen also jan 24 1987 
our fear is that as time goes on we are likely to get caught up 
even more in the ebb and flow of our everyday lives one day their 
names may not even draw the faintest of recognitions and then all 
hope will be lost 
god forbid

the clarionledger jackson miss on the keating five 
sir i believe what is on trial here is not the five 
colleagues of mine but the us senate and for that matter the 
congress of the united states thundered sen daniel inouye at 
the keating five hearings 
what he said is true but it should not as inouye did be said 
in defense of the socalled keating five 
those who defend the five senators say the line between helping 
a constituent and taking a bribe is very slim 
that may be true too like the difference between good and 
evil life and death right and wrong 
its another way in which the words and actions of our elected 
representatives dont jibe with the common citizen 
and until the campaign finance laws are reformed to make the 
average americans voice louder than the fat cats cash the 
language of our politicians will not reflect the voice of the 
american people

los angeles daily news on taxes and the airline industry 
those new tax increases devised by congress and president bush 
to cut the federal deficit have begun to bite and now were 
waiting for the payoff businesses and consumers still act as 
if they expect things to get worse before they get better 
taxes on airline tickets went up 2 percent by itself 
this tax hike is modest it increases the cost of most tickets by 
less than 10 
several carriers are struggling and the new tax could well act 
upon them like a wave of economic influenza sparing the healthy 
but killing the infirm 
thats the problem with raising taxes even modestly when the 
economy is sagging many enterprises that would absorb the new cost 
easily when business is good dont have the same cushion when sales 
are off 
even before saddam hussein congress and bush made their 
economic moves the airline industry already was in the process of 
consolidation in which the weak were getting weaker and the strong 
were swallowing them up it would seem that the tax increase can 
only hasten the day when domestic air travel is controlled by 
just three or four companies 
its not the proper role of government to prop up companies that 
cant make a profit but the government should try not to kick 
companies through taxation or any other means when theyre down

sarasota fla heraldtribune on fuel conservation 
in the interests of fuel conservation reduced emissions through 
more conservation driving habits and better maintenance of our 
roads and highways we have urged higher taxes on gasoline but it 
still hurts when the price of a fillup goes up 
though the price rises associated with the tensions in the 
persian gulf have not led to less consumption of gasoline perhaps 
the new round of tax increases will prompt drivers to plan their 
trips more carefully car pool when possible break out bicycles 
and break in new walking shoes 
americans may even take a sharper look at their gas guzzlers 
comparing their efficiency to the promised economy of smaller cars 
if americans respond to the tax rises by conserving and using 
fuel more wisely we can make progress toward a more responsible 
energy policy but even proponents of the gasoline taxes will feel 
the sting when we fill up our tanks

the reporter fond du lac wis on cosby vs simpson 
the news probably brought out some cheering and sneering along 
with sighs and maybe even cries that bad boy brat bart simpson 
edged out a rerun of the cosby show by threetenths of a point 
now that the two television shows are on opposite each other 
thursday nights the choice is clear 
viewers of the simpsons take delight in the antics of cartoon 
character bart simpson and both youngsters and young adults see 
great humor in his illmannered actions and insolent attitude 
cos watchers find bart a disrespectful brat with offensive 
behavior as opposed to the cleancut wholesome cosby family which 
is sure to end its show on the right side of everything 
seeing this as a battle between good and evil is really going to 
an extreme its too much to consider it a battle between young 
iconoclasts and old conservatives 
its simply a matter of good taste given the choice of only 
those two programs good taste should make the choice easy

athens ohio messenger on china 
its one of the paradoxes of totalitarian regimes that they 
empty language of all objective meaning and yet employ words to 
send subtle and often sinister messages to the people they 
repress thats why a recent evening newscast in china carried 
ominous implications 
since the early days of chinas liberalization in the late 
1970s television news anchors have opened their shows with 
viewers hello earlier last month the program began 
comrades hello 
the dread cword symbol of coerced solidarity and phony 
totalitarian chumminess had largely fallen from official usage 
its reappearance is taken by many chinese as a sign that reigning 
hardliners want to reassert their control not only of political 
institutions but also of social custom 
a small matter perhaps but looking through the distorting lens 
of communism one can never be sure of the gauge of things its 
safe to say however that despite the comradely so to speak 
efforts of president bush and his administration chinese communism 
is as entrenched as ever

the times of india new delhi on britains new prime minister 
although britains new prime minister john major is widely 
held to be a margaret thatcher clone his choice of michael 
heseltine one of his two rivals for the tory leadership as 
environment secretary suggests he has a mind of his own 
true the appointment can be seen as a way of bringing 
heseltine down a notch or two by filling a relatively minor slot 
one moreover which would test his commitment to reviewing the 
controversial community poll tax that mrs thatcher had introduced 
on the other hand by making so fierce and consistent a critic 
of the tax as heseltine responsible for taking a second look at 
it major is indicating that he is prepared if necessary to 
undo one of his putative patrons landmark measures hardly the 
behaviour of a clone 
majors retention of douglas hurd as foreign secretary sends 
a different signal one of continuity this is likely and may have 
been meant to reassure the americans who valued mrs thatchers 
support on the persian gulf crisis very highly and who were 
apprehensive that her successor might not be quite as 
enthusiastically supportive 
 
dec 3 
straits times singapore on britains new prime minister 
what is important is that john major a man of humble origins 
whose early youth was marked by economic hardship has risen to the 
highest elected office in britain on his own merits without the 
props of wealth or class 
he thus exemplifies the social mobility that was accelerated by 
the policies of his predecessor margaret thatcher whose views 
on most issues he basically shares 
in an important decision he has promised to review the 
socalled poll tax a controversial levy to fund local services 
whose unpopularity with many britons could hurt the conservative 
partys chances in the next general election 
notwithstanding this however major in effect represents 
thatcherism without mrs thatcher that element of change within 
continuity should be good for britain both domestically and 
abroad

the independent london on the persian gulf 
president bush said that the iraqi leader doesnt 
necessarily believe that i am totally committed to what i have been 
saying 
why should he president saddam hussein has been given little 
reason to believe the united states has the will for war 
the behavior of congress is undermining the credibility of 
bushs threat of force and is encouraging the iraqi leader in his 
dangerous intransigence 
when bushs firm position is subject to sustained attack the 
effect is to make war more not less likely 
although talks between the united states and iraq will almost 
certainly take place the situation continues to move closer to 
war 
 
dec 3 
alahram cairo egypt on the persian gulf 
president george bushs initiative for talks with iraq was a

the us government endorsed the canadian 
findings about a 1985 crash in gander newfoundland without 
consulting the chief federal investigator who looked into the 
disaster according to congressional testimony today 
george seidlein testified that the canadian panel was wrong in 
concluding that ice on the wings caused the disaster that killed a 
planeload of american servicemen 
the cause actually was due to the crew trying to force the dc8 
to climb after takeoff before it had accelerated to a high enough 
speed seidlein told the house judiciary subcommittee on crime 
seidlein was the national transportation safety boards chief 
onsite investigator in gander but his superiors didnt consult 
him on his views of the canadian findings which the us 
government endorsed 
by the time canada reached its conclusions seidlein had 
transferred to an agency office in lansing mich and was about to 
retire he testified 
seidlein wasnt intentionally excluded from consultations 
testified ronald schleede the ntsbs investigations chief who was 
seidleins boss 
why did you send him up there to gander asked us rep 
william hughes dnj is there a reason you didnt bring him 
in 
no sir replied schleede 
on tuesday witnesses told the panel the us government has no 
reason to suspect a terrorist tie to the crash 
within hours of the tragedy the us military officials readily 
accepted canadian investigators theory that the chartered dc8 
jetliner went down seconds after takeoff because of ice on its 
wings witnesses told a house hearing tuesday 
several eyewitnesses said tuesday that they saw a bright light 
in the sky just before the crash and a terrorist group aligned 
with iran claimed responsibility for destroying the jet rep robin 
tallon dsc and some families of the victims theorize a 
terrorist act connected to the irancontra scandal might have 
caused the crash 
how could canadian investigators so quickly rule out terrorism 
and the us government readily accept the assertion disbelieving 
congressmen asked 
i cant explain that responded lt filotas a canadian 
aeronautical engineer who dissented from a majority finding of a 
canadian panel that ice on the wings caused the crash 
the theory of ice on the wings is preposterous said 
filotas who attributed the crash to an inflight fire possibly 
caused by a bomb 
fbi agents who went to gander cooled their heels in a local 
motel after offering their help to the canadians who declined it 
said rep lawrence smith dfla the agents went home 36 hours 
after they arrived when the canadians informed them terrorism had 
been ruled out smith said 
the fbi told the house panel it has no reason to question the 
accuracy of the canadian findings 
no credible evidence has surfaced suggesting the plane crash 
was the result of an act of terrorism nicholas ohara deputy 
assistant director for criminal investigations at the fbi said in 
written testimony 
yet the pilot who flew the first leg of the doomed flight to 
cairo told the fbi he believed the explosion of a bomb may have 
caused the crash said tallon the pilot said an egyptian guard 
assigned to the plane disappeared from his post several times 
the fbi found very serious allegations but there is no 
record of what the agency did after it received them said tallon 
tallon wondered whether the fbi and the royal canadian mounted 
police withheld allegations relating to terrorism from the canadian 
panel that looked into the crash 
the dec 12 1985 tragedy killed 248 members of the armys 
101st airborne division coming home from a peacekeeping mission in 
the middle east all eight crew members on the charter flight of 
miamibased arrow air also died 
arrow air was one of the subcontractors that hauled weapons to 
the contra rebels in nicaragua for oliver norths secret resupply 
network it operated in 1985 and 1986 during a congressional ban on 
us military aid to the guerrillas 
the gander crash occurred less than three weeks after the reagan 
administration secretly assisted a shipment of hawk antiaircraft 
missiles from israel to iran as part of the us effort to free 
hostages held in lebanon the iranians were outraged and felt they 
had been duped because the missiles werent the kind they wanted 
rep william hughes the subcommittees chairman asked whether 
the pentagons defense intelligence agency questioned the canadians 
about the possibility of a terrorist bomb aboard the plane 
i dont know of any inquiries made of the canadians replied 
william allard the dias general counsel hughes dnj said he 
found that incomprehensible 
allard said the agency gathers strategic and tactical military 
intelligence rather than doing investigative work

foreign minister david levy warned saddam 
hussein today that israel would destroy his security if he 
tried to use peace moves in the persian gulf as a springboard for 
an attack on the jewish state 
levys remarks to parliament reflected the apparent unease of 
israeli officials at the prospect of a resolution of the gulf 
crisis that would leave the iraqi presidents army and missiles 
intact 
israel does not use the same instruments and the same deadly 
weapons as saddam hussein used against his people and threatens to 
use against us levy said 
but if anyone thinks that through some maneuver in the name of 
peace he will be able to continue to threaten with the aim of 
surprising israel he will find israel ready always with its 
might to destroy his security to hurt him until he is sorry and 
regrets his action levy said 
earlier a tel aviv newspaper said israel had tacitly warned the 
united states that it will feel free to deal with the iraqi 
military threat if the united states doesnt 
officials said the report in the daily haaretz went too far 
but that they were watching president bushs latest diplomatic 
moves in the persian gulf very carefully 
haaretz said levy met tuesday with us ambassador william brown 
and told him israel had kept a low profile on the gulf crisis 
because it was given to understand that the united states would 
confront iraqs military might 
in this lay a hint that if the united states backs out of its 
undertaking israel will no longer feel committed to a lowprofile 
policy and would react to the iraqi threat the paper said 
iraq has threatened to attack israel if war breaks out in the 
gulf in the past it has vowed to use chemical weapons against the 
jewish state and israel has distributed gas masks to its citizens 
israeli officials speaking on condition of anonymity said 
israel expects the united states to abide by all its undertakings 
but added that israel has not received any official assurance that 
washington will disarm iraq 
an official said israel believes that once the crisis is 
resolved iraq will be unable to carry out its threats against 
israel he then amended believes to hopes 
levy summoned brown after receiving a message from secretary of 
state james a baker iii explaining bushs offer to send baker to 
baghdad and receive iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz in 
washington 
haaretz said levy told visiting european dignitaries tuesday 
that israel would adopt the highest profile if its existence 
was threatened 
these remarks coupled with the statement to ambassador brown 
express a new israeli policy toward the gulf crisis following the 
invitation to iraq to negotiate with the united states haaretz 
said 
the officials denied israeli policy had changed 
another newspaper davar said levys message to washington was 
sharp it quoted unidentified sources in jerusalem as saying 
this message was the most significant so far between washington 
and jerusalem on the gulf crisis 
davar said israel regarded the united states official goals in 
the gulf to be iraqs withdrawal and the restoration of the ousted 
kuwaiti rgime but also believed it had unofficial goals 
including in israels opinion the disarming of iraq including 
nuclear facilities

the dangerous habit of sniffing butane and propane 
gas to get high appears to be growing among affluent adolescents 
and may even approach epidemic levels two health experts warn 
in a letter published in thursdays new england journal of 
medicine they described two cases in cincinnati in which boys died 
suddenly while sniffing gas both occurred within a sixweek period 
this year in middleclass neighborhoods 
doctors have known about sudden sniffing death since at 
least 1970 but such deaths are rarely reported in the united 
states 
they said they suspect that abuse of these readily available 
inhalants has reached epidemic proportions indicating an urgent 
need for preventive efforts directed at teenagers and their 
parents with an emphasis on the risk of sudden death from 
sniffing 
the gases can kill by triggering cardiac arrest the warning was 
contained in a letter written by pharmacist earl siegel and dr 
suman wason of childrens hospital medical center in cincinnati 
they said that in march an 11yearold boy was found collapsed 
in the a movie theater bathroom along with a plastic bag and a 
container of butane lighter fuel efforts to revive him failed and 
traces of butane were found in the boys blood and lungs 
six weeks later a 15yearold boy lost consciousness while 
playing with propane taken from a back yard gas grill he and 
friends inhaled the gas and also engaged in torch breathing 
blowing out the gas and lighting it he died on his way to the 
hospital and traces of propane also were found in his body 
interviews with friends and school officials about the boy in 
the first case revealed that the sniffing of butane lighter fuel 
was common among many children at their upper middleclass school 
in cincinnati they wrote

the german and soviet governments have not 
discussed what to do with deposed east german communist leader 
erich honecker who is in a soviet military hospital outside 
berlin an official said wednesday 
hans klein chief spokesman for chancellor helmut kohls 
government told reporters the matter was being handled by 
authorities in berlin they brought manslaughter charges against 
honecker last week for the shoottokill orders once directed at 
east germans trying to flee to the west 
honeckers fate is one of the first thorny issues facing bonn 
and moscow since the two governments signed several treaties on 
soviet troop withdrawals germansoviet cooperation and 
nonaggression 
klein insisted the federal government had no role in honeckers 
case 
we have a united german law and the justice senator in berlin 
and the justice minister in brandenburg are in charge he said 
the government never puts pressure on the administration of 
justice 
the spokesman also ducked a question on whether the soviet 
military had any legal right in the new united germany to hide a 
german citizen from german authorities 
klein said no one was hiding honecker because everyone knew 
where he was 
german police must have permission from the soviets to enter the 
hospital in a soviet military compound in beelitz a town 20 miles 
south of berlin to arrest honecker 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman vitaly churkin said in moscow 
on monday that honecker was staying at the hospital for 
humanitarian reasons 
a berlin court last friday issued an arrest warrant for 
honecker 78 on manslaughter charges in the shoottokill orders 
issued to east german guards at the nowfallen berlin wall and 
inner german border 
honecker has denied all the charges against him including that 
he was personally responsible for the estimated 200 people who died 
trying to escape his repressive government 
honeckers lawyers have said their client is too ill to stand 
trial media reports earlier this year said honecker was suffering 
from kidney cancer but german television has broadcast pictures of 
a fitlooking honecker walking the grounds of the hospital

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
will send a special envoy to israel later this week to discuss the 
palestinian problem a senior un official said wednesday 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
jeanclaude aime would go to israel as soon as the security council 
concludes its work on an occupied territories resolution 
the council took up that resolution wednesday yemeni ambassador 
abdalla saleh alashtal who chairs the council this month said a 
vote is expected thursday 
the plobacked resolution would establish a unappointed 
ombudsman to monitor israels treatment of the palestinians 
it would also endorse the idea of calling a meeting of the 164 
nations that signed the fourth geneva convention to pressure israel 
itself a signatory to accept the accords as applicable in the 
occupied territories 
the geneva convention forbids military forces from attacking 
civilians under occupation even in selfdefense and outlaws 
deportations and collective punishment two tactics israel has used 
to try to break the palestinian uprising 
perez de cuellar had been holding off sending aime until the 
council finished its work 
aime goes to israel as part of a compromise in which israel 
agreed to receive him if it was understood that he would not be 
investigating the oct 8 temple mount shootings in which israeli 
police killed 17 palestinians 
israeli officials said the palestinians were stoning jews at the 
western wall below and said the police fired in selfdefense 
israel contends that accepting a un inquiry into an event in 
jerusalem would call into question its sovereignty over the city 
which it has made its capital 
the jewish state captured the eastern arab sector of the city 
from jordan in the 1967 middle east war and later annexed it most 
nations reject israels claim to east jerusalem

the government said today it will lift its ban 
on blood donations by haitians and will intensify efforts to screen 
heterosexuals who pose a risk of transmitting aids 
the strengthened program will enhance rather than replace 
the current procedures used to safeguard the blood supply said 
health secretary louis w sullivan the changes will be phased in 
by the food and drug administration an agency of the department of 
health and human services 
by shifting the focus of screening procedures to cover a 
broader range of risk factors fda will build upon the safety of 
the blood supply while providing all healthy and willing 
individuals the opportunity to donate blood 
haitians had protested the ban as discriminatory and a federal 
advisory panel last spring said the policy should be ended hhs 
spokesman brad stone said the rescission follows the work of that 
blood products advisory committee 
hhs also will ease the ban on blood donations by black africans 
where testing for the form of the aids virus found in subsaharan 
africa is available 
the most important thing they need to do now is remove the 
stigma said dr jeanclaude compas a brooklyn ny family 
practitioner and chairman of the haitian coalition on aids 
almost every single medical book in this country has haitians 
associated with aids he said even though there is no 
association between any disease and national origin 
it was very traumatic to haitians and particularly to haitian 
youngsters said joseph etienne director of the haitian center 
council in queens ny he said the food and drug administration 
informed him of the decision this morning 
new york with 400000 and miami with 100000 have the 
highest population of haitian emigres in the united states he 
said 
in place of the ban all prospective blood donors will be 
required to answer written and oral questions about highrisk 
behavior about 9 million people give blood each year 
the ban had been imposed early in the epidemic because 
scientists said at the time they had found high numbers of aids 
cases transmitted by heterosexual contact among haitians 
scientists and policymakers believed that screening for 
highrisk heterosexual contact would be too difficult compared with 
screening for drug use or homosexual contact the chief modes of 
transmission among most americans 
the policy had originally excluded haitians who came to this 
country after 1977 but it was extended early this year to all 
haitians 
the change sparked widespread protests among haitianamericans 
and black african immigrants who claimed the policy was causing 
discrimination in employment and housing 
panelists last spring said there were no data to support 
excluding haitians 
prospective donors will be asked whether in the last 12 months 
they have had syphilis gonorrhea or hepatitis traded money or 
drugs for sex been paid for sex 
all donated blood is tested for the aids virus before it is 
used however an infected person may not test positive for six 
months after contracting the virus

american workers productivity grew at a 
mediocre annual rate of 02 percent in the julyseptember period 
while the nations businesses trimmed the working hours of their 
employees the government said wednesday 
analysts took the 02 percent falloff in hours the first such 
decline since 1986 as a sign that american businesses had been 
bracing over the summer for a recession which many economists 
think has taken hold 
the labor departments report did not come as a surprise 
economists said because many american businesses have implemented 
largescale layoffs in recent months 
there was some cutting because of the expectation there was 
trouble down the road said robert dederick chief economist at 
the northern trust co of chicago 
generally productivity defined as output per hour of work 
should increase if hours are cut but that didnt have much of an 
impact in the third quarter largely because the sluggish economy 
kept output unchanged analysts said 
its hard to make much progress on productivity when output is 
sliding out from under your feet its sort of a race to keep step 
with it a race weve been losing dederick said 
increased productivity or getting each worker to produce more 
during each hour of work is considered vital to boosting the 
nations standard of living without inflation 
the 02 percent third quarter increase in nonfarm productivity 
followed an equally anemic 03 percent rise in the second quarter 
of 1990 still it was better than the 13 percent plunge in 
productivity during the first quarter of 1990 
so far this year productivity has fallen at an annual rate of 
02 percent 
the economy just isnt going anywhere the productivity 
numbers are extremely weak but we know were in a recession so 
it doesnt come as much of a shock said michael k evans who 
heads an economic forecasting firm in washington 
during all of 1989 productivity fell 07 percent 
before that decline productivity growth had averaged around 14 
percent a year for the past several years better than the 12 
percent average of the 1970s but far worse than the 33 percent 
annual gain posted in the two decades after world war ii 
wednesdays report provided revised figures on the third quarter 
of 1990 the 02 percent revised increase was not nearly as big an 
improvement as the 16 percent rise first reported by the labor 
department 
during the julyseptember period the number of hours worked in 
nonfarm sectors edged down 02 percent a slightly bigger decline 
than the 01 percent decrease first reported it was the first 
falloff in hours worked since 1986 
hourly labor costs a major measure of inflation for businesses 
shot up 46 percent in the third quarter compared with a 5 percent 
rise in the second quarter during all of 1989 hourly labor costs 
increased 32 percent 
unit labor costs a key gauge of future price inflation rose 
44 percent in the third quarter compared with 47 percent in the 
second quarter last year unit labor costs increased 39 percent 
for the year 
total business productivity including farming rose 04 percent 
in the third quarter compared with a 06 percent increase in the 
second quarter for all of 1989 business productivity fell 05 
percent 
manufacturing productivity increased much more rapidly than in 
the other sectors climbing at a 51 percent seasonally adjusted 
annual rate in the third quarter that was the largest increase 
since it rose 65 percent in the second quarter of 1987 
manufacturing productivity rose 26 percent for all of 1989 
in the third quarter hours worked in manufacturing fell 18 
percent marking the fifth time in the last seven quarters that 
hours of people working in manufacturing have fallen

a national committee today recommended a sharp 
increase in federal spending on school lunches to provide an 
estimated 24 million children with a more healthy diet 
with more singleparent households more working mothers and 
more children in poverty school lunches are more important than 
ever the citizens commission on school nutrition said 
for many children the school lunch has made the difference 
between going hungry and being satisfied between being 
undernourished and being well fed the committee said 
the committee called upon congress to greatly increase the 
amount spent per student on school lunches but did not say how much 
additional money was needed it said current funding adjusted for 
inflation is 58 percent of what it was when the program was 
started in 1946 
one of its members vivian pilant director of school food 
services for south carolina said it would take at least 200 
million to provide a more healthy diet 
the committee also recommended that congress mandate that 
schools offer only milk with 2 percent or less fat and reduce this 
later to 1 percent it said this is one of the keys to a fatfree 
diet 
the panel urged schools to limit lunches to an average of 35 
percent of calories from fat in the next two to four years and 
then to 30 percent of calories 
the report said a meal of grilled cheese and peas served with 
whole milk draws 414 percent of its calories from fat this would 
be reduced to 37 percent with 1 percent milk and to 34 percent with 
skim milk it said 
michael f jacobson executive director of the center for 
science in the public interest said he believed such legislation 
could be passed despite expected opposition from the dairy 
industry 
mcdonalds service only lowfat 1 percent milk said 
jacobson cant schools do as well asmcdonalds i think whole 
milks days are numbered in the school lunch program 
the commission was organized by the center a nonprofit 
organization that promotes changes in health and environmental 
policies 
susan acker a spokeswoman for the agriculture department said 
the department agreed with a number of the commissions 
recommendations and had taken or would take steps to implement 
them 
in some cases they would like to see us move more quickly 
than we think we will be able to ms acker said 
she said the department has issued nonbinding guidelines 
setting a national standard limiting the fat content of americans 
diet to 30 percent but believes it is going to be a slow 
process to reach this goal in the school lunch program

mci communications corp announced guidelines 
wednesday designed to help protect customers from misleading or 
fraudulent services on 900telephone numbers which it plans to 
start offering nationwide on jan 1 
the company said the consumer safeguards will include a 4 cap 
on each call to childoriented 900 services 
there have been widespread complaints of fraud and deceptive 
advertising in the socalled audiotext services industry which in 
just a few years has mushroomed into a billiondollar annual 
business 
the mci policies will include 
prescreening of programs and advertising 
strict guidelines on which companies will be allowed to bill 
their services through mci 
an upgraded consumer complaint monitoring and tracking system 
a requirement that adult services be placed on a single prefix 
when available to facilitate blocking requests by customers 
support of regulatory efforts to make free blocking of all 900 
numbers available to residential customers 
mci believes the majority of 900 programs available today 
provide valuable information to businesses and consumers said 
eugene eidenberg mci executive vice president however 
aggressive action to combat abuses against consumers is necessary 
if the industry is to realize its full potential 
mci the nations second largest longdistance company thus far 
has been testing the 900number services and has offered only 
limited commercial availability said mci spokeswoman pam small 
starting jan 1 mci will offer our service to an unlimited 
number of customers small said 
phone audiotext companies offer popular services such as 
weather sports theater information oneway chats with music 
personalities shopping information stock quotes and political 
pitches to callers to 900 longdistance numbers callers typically 
receive flatrate or perminute charges for the calls on their 
phone bills 
con artists have found easy pickings in the audiotext business 
levying astounding phone charges in some cases to callers seeking 
games of chance sex talk and easy credit 
witnesses before a house hearing in september told of 8000 
phone bills and phony santa claus lines 
daniel clearfield executive deputy in the pennsylvania state 
attorney generals office testified that thousands of people 
nationwide were being victimized daily by fraudulent or worthless 
900number services 
he said the industry had the potential to be the telemarketing 
consumer fraud problem of the 1990s 
the hearing focused on legislation by rep bart gordon dtenn 
that would impose federal restrictions on the phone audiotext 
industry but the bill opposed by phone and audiotext industry 
representatives as well as a federal communications commission 
official did not get out of committee 
in october the national association of information services a 
900number industry group issued a code of responsibility

former gen hussain muhammad ershad 
like the eight men who preceded him as president of bangladesh 
kept an alert eye on the military in his young coupprone nation 
he should have been watching the civilians for they were the 
ones who ultimately forced him to offer his resignation this week 
his chief political opponents were two women known as much for 
their animosity toward each other as for their fervent desire to 
dump ershad the man they called a military dictator ershad like 
so many others found it easy to discount them 
what he didnt foresee was that the women sheik hasina and 
khaleda zia whose speeches rarely offered much substance beyond 
ershad must go would preside over a movement that exploded 
beyond their staged rallies into popular mass support 
ershads strength was his weakness he stayed too long 
in the 19 years since bangladesh broke away from pakistan in a 
civil war it has never achieved a transition of power through the 
ballot box but ershad lasted nearly nine years far longer than 
any of his predecessors whose terms ranged from a few weeks to 
four years and were always replaced by military coups 
he brought a measure of discipline and stability to an 
impoverished nation that sorely needed it but in the process he 
seemed to acquire an arrogant confidence in his own ability to 
survive 
being a military man helped me because i have a trained mind 
i have organized thinking ershad said in an interview in late 
september that is why i dont make many mistakes 
sipping tea and seated on a brocadecovered pseudoantique 
chair in his house deep inside dhakas military base ershad added 
my offices are organized computerized everything i want is in 
my computer system politics do not influence my decisions 
during the interview which took place 19 days before mrs zia 
and hasina launched the strikes and protests that would lead to his 
retreat from power ershad spoke confidently of his ability to win 
the presidential elections he had called for june 1991 
and in the next election after 1991 my vice president will 
be the candidate so i have to find a way to go out he said 
if i can hand over power peacefully and step down democracy will 
take root 
to his credit after leading a bloodless coup in march 1982 
ershad did not become the sort of totalitarian leader who often 
emerges in developing nations human rights activists generally 
gave him good marks 
political opponents seldom disappeared in bangladesh or emerged 
from detention with marks and tales of torture 
when demonstrators defied curfews and bans on public protests 
this month ershad called in the army to support the police and 
paramilitary forces but there was no massive show of force even 
when tens of thousands of people flooded the streets for days in a 
row 
the nationwide death counts for the past week ranged from the 
governments claim of six to the oppositions claim of 100 
fair elections were another matter when ershad resigned from 
the army and was elected president in 1986 foreign diplomats and 
journalists said the openness with which the ballot boxes were 
stuffed was ludicrous ironically longtime political observers 
said ershad had a good chance of winning a fair election because 
his opposition was so splintered 
although bangladeshs 110 million people have a per capita 
income of barely 170 a year and nearly 70 percent of them are 
illiterate they have a natural bent for politics 
the country has more than 100 nationally recognized political 
parties most of whom usually boycotted elections because they were 
convinced ershad and his jatiya party would not permit their 
candidates to win 
this time when mrs zias bangladesh nationalist party and 
hasinas awami league sounded the call for an antiershad strike 
doctors lawyers and tv actors joined the usual party activists 
students and rentacrowds from the shantytowns 
merchant sailors and civil servants resigned their government 
jobs in protest 
the military was silent for the first time bangladesh was 
headed for political change without tanks rolling down the streets 
or army officer assassins crashing into a presidents house in the 
dark of night 
if the opposition can maintain its unity and momentum and 
these are still major questions hasina and mrs zia should find 
personal and political satisfaction 
hasinas father was sheik mujibur rahman bangladeshs first 
president who was assassinated during a military coup in 1975 
mrs zias husband president ziaur rahman was assassinated in 
another military coup in 1981 
if the opposition permits it ershad a credible poet and a 
skillful golfer may be able to realize a dream he spoke of during 
his interview in september 
when i am no longer president i can go back to the golf 
course and play 18 holes instead of the nine holes i normally play 
now in the mornings 
 
editors note earleen fisher ap bureau chief in new delhi 
since 1987 has reported frequently on bangladesh

new legislation being considered by the european 
parliament will guarantee working women in european community 
countries at least 14 weeks maternity leave at full pay and the 
guarantee of a job on return 
the proposal contrasts sharply with policy in the united states 
where there is no federal law guaranteeing maternity leave 
all 12 european community countries already offer women some 
form of paid maternity leave but the new directive sets a minimum 
and bars dismissal linked to pregnancy 
the draft directive passed last week by the european 
parliaments committee on womens rights also provides two weeks 
compulsory rest before birth it applies to any woman working full 
or part time 
this directive stops women from being penalized for what is a 
normal part of a womans life said christine crawley chairwoman 
of the committee and a labor party ec parliamentarian from britain 
it will result in a lot more british women having the same 
career opportunities as men she said it is a major 
breakthrough 
british women have the most to gain under the new legislation 
under existing british law women are entitled to six weeks leave 
at 90 percent of regular pay followed by an additional 12 weeks at 
the equivalent of 7450 per week 
french women by comparison have 16 weeks leave at full pay 
germany grants 14 weeks at full pay and denmark offers 28 weeks at 
90 percent pay 
the new european directive also requires employers to improve 
working conditions for pregnant and breastfeeding women it 
stipulates that prenatal visits to the doctor be counted as work 
time with no loss of pay 
in the united states 30 states have laws granting unpaid leave 
from six weeks to one year 
its not a question of pay were the only western 
industrialized country that does not permit jobprotected leave 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo said in a telephone interview 
from washington 
ms schroeder was the prime sponsor of a bill known as the 
family amd medical leave act that was vetoed by president bush 
last spring the bill provided 10 to 12 weeks of unpaid leave 
she said the bill will be reintroduced in the next session of 
congress and that the european legislation will increase 
congressional determination to see it made law 
im glad to know theres enlightenment somewhere on the planet 
and i hope it spreads to the united states ms schroeder said 
the bush administration in vetoing the legislation argued that 
it was not the governments role to dictate how private industry 
dealt with employees 
if that argument were taken to logical conclusion there would 
be no health or safety standards at all at work mrs crawley 
said 
maternity leave is one of many benefits offered by european 
governments attempting to encourage women to reproduce many 
governments are concerned by a birth rate that is stable or falling 
and a population that is graying 
onethird of europes 321 million people are over age 50 that 
proportion could reach onehalf by the year 2000 according to some 
estimates 
in much of the third world birth rates are soaring 
the european directive will be considered by parliament during 
its next full session which begins monday it then goes to the ec 
council of ministers for approval if approved it has the force of 
law throughout the european community after dec 31 1992 
one european parliament official said the chance of passage was 
better than excellent 
mrs crawley said italy which holds the rotating ec presidency 
hopes to have the maternity directive passed by dec 18 britain is 
the only member to have expressed reservations she said

president bush today saluted 
president carlos s menem for quashing a military rebellion and 
said it demonstrated that the days of violence and dictatorship 
in argentina are over 
bush at a news conference with menem at the presidential 
palace also said im not optimistic that iraqs saddam hussein 
will withdraw from kuwait without a fight 
he praised the argentine president for sending two warships to 
the gulf to help enforce the united nations sanctions against iraq 
and for the tough freemarket reforms menem has instituted to cure 
argentinas hyperinflation 
bush reiterated that there will be no concessions for the iraqi 
dictator and said there should be no effort to help saddam find a 
facesaving way to pull his troops out of kuwait 
when naked aggression takes place its not a question of 
finding saving face for the aggressor bush said heatedly 
when a country is literally raped and pillaged should the world 
go out and try to find a way to save face for he who has raped and 
pillaged that country 
bush came to the argentine capital this morning from uruguay 
midway through his fivecountry trek through south america just 
two days ago bullets flew in buenos aires during a shortlived 
military rebellion 
but the troops who took over the armed forces headquarters a 
block from the presidential palace surrendered by days end it 
was the fourth military uprising in four years for argentinas 
nascent democracy 
argentina helped lead the way in restoring democracy and 
president menem and the argentine people proved again this week 
that they will not permit any group to return argentina to the days 
of violence and dictatorship said bush it was a superb show 
of strength and commitment 
he said menem has also been a leader in the continents shift to 
freemarket reforms and privatization of staterun industry and he 
said i am very grateful for argentinas strong leadership and 
support for the worlds common purpose in the persian gulf 
menem praised bushs enterprise for the americas initiative to 
spur free trade among the nations of the western hemisphere 
relations with the united states are now very good and they will 
get better after this visit he said 
on iraq bush said im not optimistic i see no evidence 
saddam hussein is wiling to comply fully with the un 
resolutions 
menem said i share everything that has been said here by the 
president the only thing is for iraq to withdraw without 
conditions 
on his plans to meet at the white house with iraq foreign 
minister tariq aziz and to send secretary of state james a baker 
iii to baghdad before jan 15 bush said 
i view these talks as confined by or put it this way 
mandated by the un security council resolutions period said 
bush that means no concession of territory that means freedom 
of innocent people that are held against their will that means 
respect for embassies and that means the eventual security and 
stability of the gulf although thats not specified by the 
resolution 
i dont view these talks as having anything to do with 
concessions that stop short of full implementation of un security 
council resolutions he said 
on a separate matter bush said the new gatt treaty must tackle 
agriculture subsidies or the talks in brussels will fail 
he promised that if that round fails we will work bilaterally 
with the argentines to see that their trade with us is not set 
back the european communitys reluctance to curb protectionist 
measures for its farmers is jeopardizing the negotiations 
on argentinas steep foreign debt bush predicted menems 
economic reforms will lead to a happy ending by making the 
country more attractive to foreign investors he said the united 
states can try to be helpful with the private banks although 
it is primarily a matter for the banks and the argentine government 
to resolve 
hours before bushs arrival bombs exploded in two branches of 
the usowned chase manhattan bank in buenos aires suburbs no 
one was injured police said and no group immediately claimed 
responsibility 
after the redcarpet welcome and a wreathlaying at a monument 
to gen jose de san martin a hero of argentine independenc bush 
went to the presidential palace the casa de gobierno for private 
talks a working luncheon and a news conference with menem 
while greeting diplomats at the palace a grimfaced bush shook 
hands with the iraqi ambassador to argentina sahibhussain tahir 
as the iraqi diplomat approached bush stopped smiling and gave 
tahir a quick formal handshake without exchanging a word the 
encounter contrasted sharply with the warm greetings bush gave all 
the other members of the diplomatic corps 
bush arrived here aboard his marine one helicopter after a 
75minute flight across the river platte from punta del este 
uruguay 
authorities in santiago chile reported a bombing there this 
morning of a bridge near the us consulate the latest in a series 
of explosions by leftist chilean groups protesting bushs planned 
visit thursday there were no casualties 
this was the third stop on bushs fivenation sixday south 
american tour he began the morning with a private breakfast with 
uruguayan president luis alberto lacalle in punta del este capping 
a relaxed overnight stay in the ocean resort 
bush said tuesday he was confident that mondays military 
uprising in argentina was not a reflection on the stability of 
argentine democracy it was a militaryvsmilitary 
controversy bush said 
bush moves on to chile thursday and venezuela on friday before 
heading home saturday

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
today the united states will strike suddenly massively and 
decisively if military force is needed to get saddam hussein out 
of kuwait 
testifying before congress baker staked out a hard line against 
saddam he said his proposed trip to baghdad later this month was 
not an opening for negotiations 
this is not to be a meeting of negotiation over the terms of 
the un resolutions baker said adding that he would stick with 
the international demands for complete and immediate iraqi 
withdrawal from kuwait 
baker stopped short of saying the bush administration would 
launch an attack to liberate kuwait after jan 15 the deadline 
established last week by the united nations security council but 
he left no doubt about the administrations determination to remove 
saddam quickly 
if it force must be used it will be used suddenly 
massively and decisively he told the senate foreign relations 
committee 
in buenos aires argentina bush said any talks baker might have 
in baghdad would be mandated by the un security council 
resolutions 
that means no concession of territory that means freedom of 
innocent people that are held against their will and that means 
the eventual security and stability of the gulf although thats 
not specified by the resolution bush said in the argentine 
capital midway through a fivecountry south american trip 
baker underscored comments made last friday by bush who said he 
would not allow us soldiers to become involved in another 
protracted divisive war such as vietnam 
baker said it would be very helpful if congress would 
support the type of resolution passed by the un security council 
congressional underscoring of the message that we are trying 
to send could significantly reduce the chance of war he said 
saying that holding off a military clash with iraq would hurt 
the united states and help saddam kill kuwait baker said the 
unimposed economic squeeze has had little if any effect on 
saddams inclination to withdraw 
however sen paul sarbanes dmd and several other senators 
challenged baker saying the administration was giving up on 
sanctions prematurely 
this is a time for the patience of the longdistance runner 
sarbanes said 
he told baker youve placed us on a course to war 
on the other side of the capitol cia director william webster 
echoed baker saying there was no indication the sanctions are 
forcing saddam to rethink his policy on kuwait 
our judgment has been and continues to be that there is no 
assurance or guarantee that economic hardships will compel saddam 
to change his policies or lead to internal unrest that would 
threaten his regime webster told the house armed services 
committee 
baker whom bush has offered to send to baghdad as an emissary 
sought to rebut arguments made by members of congress some former 
us military commanders and former defense secretary robert s 
mcnamara that sanctions should be given more time to disrupt the 
iraqi economy and compel saddam to pull out of kuwait 
waiting not only gives saddam time to break the sanctions but 
it imposes costs on us baker said as we wait saddam will 
continue torturing kuwait killing it as a nation he will 
continue to fortify kuwait to build chemical and biological 
weapons and to acquire a nuclear weapons capability 
as we wait he expects other issues to deflect our attention 
weaken our resolve and dissolve the international coalition and as 
we wait the burden of saddams crime weighs heavier on the world 
that is why we must make credible our preparations to use force 
baker said 
on tuesday in a sign of growing unease house democrats 
overwhelmingly adopted a nonbinding resolution that said bush 
should not order an attack without prior approval from congress 
democrats voted 17737 in a closeddoor caucus for the 
statement which also expressed support for the presidents 
diplomatic initiatives in the gulf crisis 
also tuesday mcnamara the defense secretary at the height of 
the vietnam war told the senate committee the administration 
should continue to rely on economic sanctions as the main weapon 
against iraq for a year or more 
who can doubt that a year of blockade will be cheaper than a 
week of war mcnamara said 
the testimony reinforced expressions of caution over the last 
several days from congressional democrats and former us military 
commanders 
but bush while visiting uruguay remarked ive not been one 
whos been convinced that sanctions alone will bring him saddam 
hussein to his senses 
he said he disagreed with two former chairmen of the joint 
chiefs of staff gen david jones and adm william crowe who 
suggested bush give the sanctions up to 18 months to work 
i dont agree with them bush said i cant say how long 
but i dont agree with them 
meanwhile republican sen larry pressler of south dakota said 
americans want peace 
if we start having body bags come back we will have a very 
serious revolt in terms of public opinion he said 
sen daniel patrick moynihan dny added we have time i 
dont see any hurry i dont see any doubt that he either gets out 
or he gets thrown out blown out 
webster testified as rep les aspin dwis opened three weeks 
of hearings by his house armed services committee on the three 
major options to solving the gulf crisis sanctions diplomacy and 
war 
the country is united on ends but divided on means said 
aspin who unlike his counterpart on the senate armed services 
committee sen sam nunn dga backs bushs recent deployment of 
200000 troops in addition to the 240000 already in the gulf area 
and yet aspin said action that isnt backed by consensus 
will mean disaster whatever we do the country the congress and 
the president must do it standing on common ground

a public interest group seeking more healthful 
school lunches drew a bead on whole milk wednesday calling upon 
congress to ban milk with more than 2 percent fat from school 
cafeterias 
the citizens commission on school nutrition also called for 
increased spending on the school lunch program and urged schools 
to reduce the overall fat content of lunches to 35 percent of 
calories within the next 2 to 4 years ultimately it said the 
standard should be 30 percent 
i think whole milks days are numbered in the school lunch 
program said michael f jacobson executive director of the 
center for science in the public interest the school nutrition 
commission was organized by the center a nonprofit organization 
which promotes improved health and environmental policies 
susan acker a spokeswoman for the agriculture department which 
administers the school lunch program noted that milk for the 
lunches was required to be lowfat at one time congress passed 
legislation in 1979 requiring that whole milk be served land the 
department has since issued rules requiring that the full range of 
milk from skim to whole be available 
jacobson said the dairy industry was instrumental in reversing 
the original lowfat rule 
nevertheless he said he thinks the chances for the proposed 
lowfat rule are very good 
the whole nation is moving in the direction of health he 
said the only milk mcdonalds serves is 1 percent lowfat milk 
cant schools do as well as mcdonalds i think the changing 
environment is going to influence congress 
dairy industry officials referred inquiries to monica olson of 
the national dairy council who was not in her office on wednesday 
the commissions report said a meal of grilled cheese and peas 
served with whole milk draws 414 percent of its calories from 
fat this would be reduced to 37 percent with 1 percent milk and to 
34 percent with skim milk it said 
another organization public voice for food amp health policy 
said the recommendations do not go far enough public voice has 
called for congress to require limiting the fat content of school 
lunches to 30 percent of calories 
the agriculture department has issued guidelines establishing 
this as a nonbinding standard for americans but ms acker said 
the department believes it is going to be a slow process to put 
it into effect 
asked for comment on the commissions report she said we are 
in agreement with a number of the recommendations they made but 
they would like to see us move toward them more quickly than we 
think we will be able to 
an estimated 24 million children eat federally subsidized school 
lunches 
with more singleparent households more working mothers and 
more children in poverty school lunches are more important than 
ever the commission said 
for many children the school lunch has made the difference 
between going hungry and being satisfied between being 
undernourished and being well fed the committee said 
the panel called upon congress to greatly increase the 
amount spent per student on school lunches but did not say how much 
additional money was needed it said current funding adjusted for 
inflation is 58 percent of what it was when the program was 
started in 1946 
one of its members vivian pilant director of school food 
services for south carolina said it would take at least 200 
million to implement the departments nonbinding guidelines in 
school lunchrooms

a dc9 pilot complained he as lost in the 
fog moments before his plane collided with another jetliner 
killing eight people according to a transcript obtained by nbc 
federal investigators while refusing to confirm the precise 
conversation between the pilot and an air traffic controller said 
tuesday the dc9 crew had trouble finding its way just before 
mondays collision at the detroit airport 
also northwest airlines reported the captain was making his 
first flight without another pilot observing since his return last 
week from a fiveyear medical leave and the planes first officer 
had joined the airline last march 
twentyfour people were injured two critically in the fiery 
collision between the dc9 and a boeing 727 both operated by 
northwest the 727 was rolling down a foggy runway toward takeoff 
when the dc9 pulled in front of it 
there was another fire this morning on the wing of a northwest 
jetliner after it landed at detroit metropolitan airport the fire 
was put out and passengers safely left the aircraft officials 
said 
northwest airlines spokeswoman christy clapp said residual fuel 
in an auxilary power unit ignited on the right wing the fire was 
spotted by ground crews as the boeing 727 was taxiing to the 
terminal she said 
nbc reported tuesday that it had obtained a partial transcript 
of a conversation between dc9 pilot william lovelace and a 
controller 
according to the transcript the controller asked lovelace to 
verify the position of the dc9 which was supposed to be heading 
toward a runway for takeoff 
uh were not sure its so foggy out here were completely 
stuck here lovelace said looks like were on 21center 
here 
if youre on 21center exit that runway immediately sir 
the controller said 
moments later the planes collided 
the pilots of both planes survived the collision and the black 
box recordings of cockpit conversations were being analyzed in 
washington 
we obviously had interviews with people in the tower and we 
have determined the dc9 was having visibility problems said 
alan pollock spokesman for the national transportation safety 
board as far as exact wording i cannot comment on that 
they had difficulty in keeping track of where they were 
said ntsb investigator john lauber there were numerous 
communications between the aircraft and the air traffic control 
facilities with regard to that taxiway and exactly where they 
were 
lauber said the crew of a third northwest airliner also reported 
overhearing someone tell the tower they didnt know where they 
were but he said it was not known whether the communication came 
from the dc9 
pollock today said ntsb investigators expect to remain in 
detroit through the weekend but a formal report wont be completed 
for nine to 12 months investigators today continued questioning 
the planes crews and controllers

a group of legislators today demanded imposition 
of a state of emergency and a freeze on all political parties and 
parliaments to help pull the soviet union out of its political and 
economic crisis 
the group which included the rightwing soyuz group of 
parliamentarians as well as the reformist liberaldemocratic party 
all but called for a military coup as a means of solving the 
nations problems 
the groups leaders announced the legislators were forming a 
national salvation committee and demanded transfer of power to it 
the state news agency tass and the independent news agency interfax 
reported the committee asked the army to help implement the plan 
calling the military the sole force still resisting the 
disintegration of the state interfax reported 
vladimir zhirinovski a leader of the liberaldemocratic party 
and spokesman for the committee said in a telephone interview that 
the coalition represented 400 lawmakers in the 2250member 
congress of peoples deputies 
sentiment for a crackdown also is widespread in the communist 
party which holds a majority in most of legislative bodies on the 
national and local level many communists want president mikhail s 
gorbachev to call a state of emergency and enforce it through the 
armed forces and the kgb security police 
the national salvation committee seemed to have the same goals 
although its goals were not spelled out clearly during the news 
conference its leaders called today to announce the groups 
existence 
with all but one of the 15 soviet republics seeking some form of 
independence or autonomy from central government many officials 
fear for the very structure of the soviet union 
the soviet economy also is crumbling as the old command system 
is failing and grocery shelves in major cities are bare 
across the capital russian federation president boris yeltsin 
harshly warned military officers at the dzerzhinsky military 
academy that if the army enters our boiling society as an active 
factor confrontation will increase many times and carry the 
society to catastrophe

charles h keating jr clearly didnt care 
much for a redbearded federal thrift regulator william k black 
and by the looks of their faces wednesday defense attorneys for 
the keating five senators cared little more for him 
kill him dead keating once wrote in reference to the lawyer 
for the federal home loan bank board 
black proved to be a dramatic witness during the 12th day of 
public hearings by the senate ethics committee into the five 
senators who face allegations they unethically intervened with 
regulators on behalf of their political patron keating 
defense attorneys objected paced stammered and complained 
throughout blacks testimony which not only supported other 
regulators allegations but raised new ones 
it is the most fundamental smear declared william taylor 
attorney for sen alan cranston dcalif and later what this 
witness testified to are not facts 
innuendo said james hamilton attorney for sen dennis 
deconcini dariz reckless and irresponsible 
the lawyers tangled with the committees special counsel robert 
s bennett who called black as a witness time and again the 
committee chairman sen howell heflin dala settled the dispute 
in his unruffled alabama drawl 
now hes got wide latitude to address the witness heflin 
said 
back described arcane accounting practices but he also 
distilled them into language anyone in the room or watching on 
television could follow 
keatings lincoln savings and loan operated like a ponzi 
scheme or financial pyramid dependent on an everincreasing 
churning of assets he said 
its parent keatings american continental corp was no more 
than a shell that siphoned dividends from lincoln and 
distributed them through inflated salaries to keating his family 
members and associates black said 
we call it a scam black said simply i think most people 
do 
lincoln black said was probably the worst institution in 
america and the five senators pressure he said led to a delay 
in regulatory controls on lincoln thus causing increased losses 
that taxpayers now have to pay for to the tune of 2 billion 
instead of people trying to help bring it under control five 
us senators were pushing us in the opposite direction he said 
none of the keating five senators were present for blacks 
testimony besides cranston and deconcini they are republican john 
mccain of arizona and democrats john glenn of ohio and donald 
riegle of michigan 
keating the arizona highflier now under indictment in 
california had long ago targeted black as a problem 
the ethics committee released copies of a memo keating wrote to 
his chief washington lobbyist jim grogan on july 15 1987 making 
clear he wanted black removed in it keating refers to the then 
speaker of the house jim wright of texas as an ally 
the memo begins highest priority get black with the last 
two words underlined 
good grief keating wrote if you cant get wright and 
congress to get black kill him dead you ought to retire

former president ronald reagan said 
wednesday that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has lost 
control of the economy and may have to resort to martial law to 
preserve stability 
i think it can be said that today president gorbachev controls 
the soviet foreign ministry and he commands the loyalty of the kgb 
and the military but he does not control the economy or the 
political direction of the 15 republics reagan said in an 
address to the cambridge union debating society 
he said the best hope is that the soviet union will peacefully 
evolve into a loose confederation 
however it is conceivable that president gorbachev will feel 
the need to invoke some of his more drastic powers using the army 
and the kgb to impose and maintain martial law reagan said 
if he does so i believe it would not be from some powermad 
impulse but rather from a belief that such an action would be the 
only way to save his nation from instability 
in the course of six summit meetings with gorbachev reagan said 
he came to recognize the soviet leader as a friend 
about his meeting with gorbachev in september reagan said 
this time i saw him not only as a friend but a friend in 
need for his nation was and is going through a period of great 
uncertainty and turmoil 
reagan making the only public address of his fiveday visit in 
england spoke at an event honoring the 175th anniversary of the 
founding of the cambridge union 
he was welcomed with loud applause as he walked in slowly 
nodding to the main floor and the jammed galleries the crowd of 
more than 500 students and faculty listened intently to his speech 
delivered in a soft voice tailored for microphones and not for 
victorian debating chambers 
reagan said he looked forward to an economic competition between 
the soviet union and the west but first we must show them how 
the game is played 
reagan who once spoke of the evil empire centered in the 
kremlin said western democracies must now be teachers not 
preachers to emerging democracies 
the evil leaders who once ruled a soviet empire are gone and 
so is the empire replaced by a modern realist at the top who has 
unleashed pentup forces that yearned for freedom and democracy 
he said 
as the victors it is for us to hold out the hand of 
reconciliation as we did with fallen enemies after world war ii 
to tend to the sprouts and saplings of democracy in the former 
adversarys land until they can grow strong and tall on their 
own

computer hackers have stolen some 12 million in 
free telephone service through johnson space center in what at 
least one expert said was the biggest such theft in the nation 
according to published a report 
hundreds of people have used the system over at least two years 
the houston chronicle reported wednesday 
its the biggest one ive ever heard of and certainly the 
longestrunning one ive ever heard of said detective jim black 
computer crime unit coordinator of the los angeles police 
department and a leading authority on telecommunications theft 
the national aeronautics and space administration could not 
determine precise figures for the loss said spokesman steve 
nesbitt 
the 12 million figure was calculated from costs of similar 
breakins described by law enforcement agents specializing in 
computer crime 
nesbitt said the service was stolen in two ways by using a 
longdistance credit card number and by direct use of nasas phone 
lines the credit card fraud was discovered by atampt when use of the 
number exceeded typical patterns 
the heavy losses were sustained through four lines in the space 
centers regular phone system 
that was shut down its been deactivated nesbitt said 
the incident at nasa is the second such infiltration of a 
government agency to come to light in recent weeks on nov 17 it 
was reported that computer hackers and others had stolen phone 
service worth millions through the houston offices of the drug 
enforcement administration 
in both instances intruders gained access to the federal 
telephone system a phone service similar to a wats line the 
federal telephone system has no percall billing a fact that 
allows abuses to go undetected for so long

soviet soldiers on wednesday unloaded an emergency 
food shipment of israeli watermelons tomatoes and oranges that 
israeli leaders say is a gesture of thanks for allowing thousands 
of soviet jews to emigrate 
soviet troops shook hands with israelis on the airport tarmac 
after 10 tons of the produce was unloaded from an israeli passenger 
plane 
the shipment destined for a moscow hospital was organized by 
the quasigovernmental jewish agency which helps settle jewish 
immigrants in israel 
the boeing 767 of the national carrier el al then returned to 
tel aviv via bucharest romania where it picked up another cargo 
of 250 soviet jewish immigrants to israel 
a record number of 150000 jews from the soviet union have 
arrived in israel this year 
the food shipment is a gesture of gratitude to the soviet 
government for permitting jews to return to their homeland said 
jewish agency spokesman yehuda weinraub 
he said another 15 tons of powdered milk would be sent thursday 
to childrens hospitals in moscow leningrad and kiev 
the el al jet landed at moscow airports cargo terminal before 
dawn on wednesday and was met by soldiers and seven army trucks 
the soldiers who did not speak english or hebrew worked 
silently for an hour unloading the crates onto trucks when they 
were finished several approached the israelis to shake hands 
at bucharests airport the departure terminal was packed with 
soviet jews who had traveled overland by bus most from odessa to 
board planes to israel 
the soviet union does not permit direct flights between moscow 
and tel aviv and the immigrants are routed through transit 
stations in poland hungary and romania 
some of the immigrants tired from the long bus trip complained 
they were forced to wait hours at the airport in bucharest to get a 
seat on an el al plane many clutched possessions as they waited 
including a cello a small dog and a bundle of brooms 
matvey rabinovich 85 of odessa wore a jacket covered with 
soviet military medals he said he planned to stay with a nephew 
who is a doctor in the israeli town of holon

us gen colin l powell chairman of the joint 
chiefs of staff said wednesday that if it comes to war in the 
persian gulf the united states intends to use overwhelming 
force to win 
he also said saddam hussein must withdraw unconditionally from 
kuwait to avert war 
the united states is not going to blink on this one said 
powell he must leave 
powell addressing a london research center the royal united 
services institute said he did not doubt that the united states 
and the other allied forces massed against iraq could win a 
conflict but he said he did not know how long it would take 
if we have to use force if it comes to that the united 
states intends to use overwhelming force to win decisively as 
quickly as possible with as few casualties as possible said 
powell 
british government leaders have also stressed the nocompromise 
policy in the past few days amid speculation that the planned trip 
to iraq by us secretary of state james a baker iii could end up 
as negotiations 
president bush says the aim of bakers trip is simply to ensure 
that saddam understands the seriousness of last weeks un 
resolution authorizing the use of force unless iraq withdraws from 
kuwait by jan 15 
some senior british defense officials have indicated they feel 
that a decision on military action should be made quickly after the 
jan 15 deadline you will then either have to fish or cut 
bait one said this week speaking on condition of anonymity 
britain last month announced the near doubling of its military 
force in the gulf to 30000 in steppedup preparations for war 
powell arrived tuesday for a twoday british visit arranged 
before the gulf crisis began in august 
he conferred with british defense chiefs and met the new prime 
minister john major powell will go on to brussels headquarters 
of the nato alliance 
powell who is bushs senior military adviser brushed aside an 
unconfirmed british television report that iraq would withdraw if 
allowed to keep a disputed oil field 
the issue is more than the use of a single oil field he 
said 
answering questions he said he could see no circumstances in 
which bush would compromise or negotiate with saddam 
powell stopped well short of saying war was inevitable if saddam 
holds out after jan 15 but he stressed repeatedly there could be 
no compromises 
he also said that the size of the us force in the gulf some 
400000 troops does not mean the only thing to do is to use it 
or lose it 
we have given the president a solid military option to make 
sure he has a whole range of options he said

kuwaiti exiles said wednesday they have formed 
a group that is drawing up plans to rebuild their country if the 
iraqi invaders are expelled 
the assumption is that everything has been looted said 
ibrahim alshaheen who was director general of kuwaits housing 
authority before the aug 2 invasion 
he said the kuwaiti committee based in washington has spent 
the last six weeks examining matters that will need to be addressed 
presuming that the kuwaitis regain possession of their country 
the kuwaitis say they are braced for the worse in terms of 
damage they believe they will have to replace items ranging from 
hospital incubators to office computers 
at kuwait university for instance furniture equipment books 
administrative files and research projects have been removed or 
destroyed 
as an example of their planning the exiles said they are 
finding out where to buy generators which will be needed to 
provide electricity 
similar plans are being made for health public welfare and 
school facilities and for roads alshaheen said at a press 
conference the world bank is also playing a role in planning for 
rebuilding kuwait 
while kuwaitis have been in contact with us agencies to find 
out where to obtain technical assistance they said they dont need 
money 
the oilrich emirate is financing its operations in exile with 
the revenue from investments that had been made abroad before the 
invasion 
mohammed alsabah chairman of the economics committee of the 
higher planning council of kuwait said the kuwaitis are prepared 
to spend billions of dollars in the rebuilding effort 
fawzi alsultan executive director of the world bank estimates 
that 20 billion to 25 billion has been lost as kuwaits economy 
has ground to a halt and the country was stripped of its resources 
iraq has destroyed the nations banking and financial system he 
said 
files and computers have been wiped out or stolen nearly 4 
billion in foreign exchange and gold reserves have been seized and 
5 billion in currency and bank deposits have been confiscated

iraq has accepted president bushs offer to 
hold talks on the persian gulf crisis the state department said 
today 
we are engaged with them on dates and arrangements for the two 
meetings the department said 
bush had proposed that iraqi president saddam hussein send his 
foreign minister tariq aziz to washington then bush said in 
making the offer last friday secretary of state james a baker iii 
would go to baghdad 
in buenos aires argentina today bush said any talks would be 
mandated by un security council resolutions that have been 
adopted since the crisis began 
that means no concession of territory that means freedom of 
innocent people that are held against their will and that 
means the eventual security and stability of the gulf although 
thats not specified by the resolution bush said 
his comments came before the state department announced that 
iraq had accepted the offer to hold talks 
earlier today baker told the senate foreign relations committee 
that he would not negotiate with saddam on the trip and added a new 
warning if force must be used it will be used suddenly 
massively and decisively 
he said his meeting in baghdad will not be the beginning of a 
negotation over the terms of the united nations resolutions nor 
baker said would he negotiate on subjects unrelated to the 
iraqi occupation of kuwait 
i will not be negotiating the palestinian question or the 
civil war in lebanon he said saddam did not invade kuwait to 
help the palestinians he did it for his own selfaggrandizement 
saddam had said earlier that the palestinian problem must be on 
the agenda in any dialogue with baker 
joe wilson the deputy ambassador in iraq was called in by the 
iraqi foreign minister to be told of iraqs acceptance of the 
offer the announcement said 
wilson and a number of other us officials remain in the us 
embassy in baghadad 
bush made last weeks unexpected overture at a presidential news 
conference in washington 
it followed mounting complaints in congress that the 
administration was rushing into war with iraq over its invasion of 
kuwait without giving diplmacy enough time for the pursuit of a 
peaceful settlement 
even so bush pledged the administration would not waver from 
the resolution approved last thursday by the un security council 
threatening a forceful eviction of iraqi troops if they did not 
withdraw by jan 15 
sen paul simon dill urged baker at todays hearing to 
provide saddam hussein with a way out of the crisis he 
suggested one approach would be to propose the world court resolve 
iraqs territorial claims against kuwait 
if at all possible make that a meaningful trip simon 
urged 
baker stressed that the un resolution did not require the 
united states to attack jan 15 or a day after without 
elaboration baker said diplomatic steps were being taken in the 
search for a peaceful solution 
however baker insisted that iraq must withdraw from all of 
kuwait liberate all foreign hostages and permit the restoration of 
the ousted government 
bush in making the offer to swap envoys said baker would not 
waver from the three demands 
the best way to get that across is oneonone baker looking 
him in the eye bush said

forget the bitter past remember the less 
fortunate have a heart invite a red army soldier home for the 
holidays 
a german friendship society is asking east germans to make life 
a little easier for the soviet force that occupied their former 
nation for 40 years 
the message set an extra place at the table this christmas 
pour another glass of champagne on new years eve call the soviet 
command and ask them to send over a soldier 
the inclination to help is very strong horst gruetzke 
spokesman for the berlinbased german society said wednesday 
the societys nationwide appeal is the latest demonstration of 
gratitude to the soviet union for giving up its claim to east 
germany and allowing german unification 
it comes amid a largescale and remarkably popular effort by 
german relief groups labor unions and companies to ship hundreds 
of tons of food and other necessities to ease the soviet unions 
chaotic food situation 
this appeal is in keeping with the relief effort said 
gruetzke we want to thank the soviets for our sovereignty 
the german society was formed in january with the goal of 
improving relations between east and west germany its members 
include former chancellor willy brandt 
the government of eastern brandenburg state said tuesday it 
would try to send holiday food packages to soviets on their bases 
and also sponsor an inviteasoldier program 
once feared and reviled the soviet army is drawing mostly pity 
these days as it prepares to pack up and leave what used to be east 
germany 
its mystique as a formidable fighting force has been replaced by 
images of lowpaid unskilled young men heading back to a homeland 
struggling with shortages and social turmoil 
a news photographer recently caught two soldiers poking through 
an eastern german garbage dump for something valuable to salvage 
reinhart luschert spokesman for the eastern german forces based 
in strausberg said he welcomed efforts by germans to share holiday 
dinners with soviet soldiers 
we are glad about such activities because we know the problems 
of the soviet soldiers he said 
there have been widespread reports of desertions and suicides by 
soviet soldiers and assaults upon them by eastern germans 
lt gen michael kalinin commander of soviet forces in eastern 
germany told a news conference in potsdam on wednesday that about 
80 soviet soldiers have deserted this year and that 24 of them 
fled to the west 
the soviets carved east germany from the ruins of world war ii 
and turned it into a mirror image of its own stalinist system 
but soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms and refusal 
to support the hardiine communist leader erich honecker helped 
lead to honeckers downfall a free society and german unity 
the soviets have agreed to remove their 360000 troops within 
four years germany has agreed to build houses for them back in the 
soviet union 
german chancellor helmut kohl has lobbied world leaders and his 
own people to send aid to the soviets to stabilize the collapsing 
food distribution system that has created dire shortages 
the german red cross said it was allocating 2 billion to the 
effort 
there are sistercity groups civic groups church groups all 
sorts of people getting involved in this said margitta 
zimmermann a red cross spokeswoman in bonn 
at least 15 charitable groups have either sent or plan to send 
powdered milk baby food preserved meats clothing and other 
supplies shipments are being made by trucks freighters and 
planes

commuters mutinied against their bus 
driver fighting him for control of the bus in a wild ride after 
they saw him acting erratically officials said 
it was inexcusable that the bus was allowed to continue for 
two feet never mind 20 minutes said john haley bay area rapid 
transit deputy general manager 
the incident occurred thursday on a laidlaw transit co bus 
operated under contract with the transit authority 
the driver 34yearold kenneth webb whos in jail was 
scheduled to appear in concord municipal court this week on charges 
that include driving under the influence battery and having an 
open container of alcohol in the bus according to the contra costa 
county district attorneys office 
it is incomprehensible to us that this man could embark on 
what was essentially a 20 or 25minute odyssey without being 
stopped haley said 
webb was arrested thursday night after the california highway 
patrol transit police and laidlaw employees converged on the 
stopped bus 
by that point an unidentified passenger who had tried to 
wrestle the driver out of his seat had suffered a broken jaw haley 
said several of the 12 passengers aboard had tried to get control 
of the bus he said 
this is a very serious situation that could have been 
prevented haley said criticizing the way the situation was 
handled by bus company personnel in charge during the incident 
the drama began about 1045 pm thursday aboard a bus that 
provides express shuttle service from a station in concord to 
brentwood laidlaw provides the drivers under contract with bart 
haley said that even before the bus left concord passengers 
waiting to board the bus reported to the station agent that the 
driver was acting erratically 
the agent telephoned transit police local police departments 
and supervising laidlaw people he said by that time the bus had 
started for the brentwood station 
the laidlaw supervisor had the opportunity to stop that bus 
by radio immediately but they did not do so haley said 
according to laidlaws own report their operator was speaking 
in slurred speech and they did not stop the vehicle 
at one point said haley the laidlaw supervisor got into a car 
and followed webbs bus and noticed that the operator was 
operating erratically 
haley said that rather than stopping the bus immediately the 
supervisor pulled over to get a pay phone and call in to the 
dispatcher to discuss how to handle the situation he didnt 
want anyone to hear the conversation on radio 
laidlaw officials did not immediately return a telephone call 
seeking comment

a neverpublished dance that norwegian 
composer edvard grieg withdrew from his orchestral masterpiece 
peer gynt was performed for the first time wednesday more than 
100 years after it was written 
also played at the concert were three rare piano pieces that 
grieg composed when he was 17 years old and dedicated to a swedish 
sweetheart 
grieg played the piano pieces at his first public concert as a 
teenager in 1861 they were seldom if ever played again the 
composer later banned their performance and ordered his copies of 
them destroyed after he died 
music lovers paid 86 nealy four times the normal oslo 
concerthall price to hear the grieg works at a benefit for a 
proposed new 172 million opera house the 1400seat hall was 
almost full 
henrik ibsen norways bestknown playwright asked grieg the 
countrys leading composer to write incidental music for ibsens 
folklore poem peer gynt the poem is a fantasy about a man who 
wanders from norway to north africa meeting mountain trolls and 
eventually finding love 
grieg composed the music in the 1870s he wrote to a friend that 
he didnt like the project but needed the money grieg felt the 
suite would never be a success outside scandinavia but it became 
one of his most admired compositions 
before peer gynt was performed grieg decided to remove the 
dance entitled the dance of the mountain kings daughter it 
was never published 
dag schjelderupebbe a grieg scholar found the dance during 
research for a catalogue of griegs music the study by an expert 
committee began in 1962 and the last of the resulting 20 volumes is 
to be released in two years 
knut skramm of the victoria recording co in oslo said the dance 
was quite simple and we can understand why grieg left it out 
but it does not show him in a bad light 
but pianist geir henning braaten who was to perform the grieg 
music at the concert said he was in raptures over the dance 
schjelderupebbe said the three early piano pieces are not the 
grieg we knowhe was so young and had not found his own style 
you can hear that the young composer is a future star 
therefore i see no reason not to perform it braaten said of the 
decision to play the pieces despite griegs ban 
griegs copies of the pieces were kept in bergen norway where

some american and british women were 
reunited with relatives wednesday at a baghdad hotel and they 
expressed hopes that president saddam hussein would free their 
loved ones 
iraqi officials met the 18 american and 24 british women at the 
airport and drove them to the almansour melia hotel to meet their 
relatives who had been brought to the capital from the strategic 
sites where they were held 
saddam told us if we come here we will not go back 
emptyhanded said dawn bazner of detroit a member of coming 
home a hostagesupport group 
the group came to baghdad accompanied by bishop thomas gumbleton 
of the detroit archdiocese 
iraq is holding hundreds of westerners hostage at strategic 
sites in an effort to deter an attack by the multinational forces 
in saudi arabia and the gulf region 
i feel we are here to do something very spectacular said 
jennifer williams 22 of dallas whose father is held hostage most 
of the women in the group were wives of hostages 
donnitta cole of texas who spoke with reporters at the airport 
in amman jordan said the iraqi ambasador in washington had 
promised a meeting with saddam 
let us hope that it will happen she said 
we have no guarantees or promises said ellen martin of 
detroit who is trying to win the freedom of her husband robert 
my hopes are high that we all will be successful in getting 
our people out said nina ginn of seattle but we have no 
concrete guarantees that that would be the case 
iraq has pledged to release all the hostages in batches between 
dec 25 and march 25 if nothing happens to disturb the 
atmosphere of peace 
gilly battersby a british woman who acted as spokeswoman for 
the hostage wives said the group had brought medicine and baby 
formula for childrens hospitals 
the american and british women said they were encouraged by the 
success of some earlier groups that traveled to baghdad to win the 
freedom of relatives 
ten britons were released by saddam after their wives and 
relatives flew to baghad and appealed for their freedom at least 
four americans were also freed after similar missions by their 
families 
many of the women carried heavy giftwrapped packets 
at least we can be with our loved ones for christmas and new 
year if we are unsuccessful in our mission said one of the 
american women in amman she spoke on condition of anonymity

the nuclear power industry is having a 
meltdown over the simpsons 
the primetime cartoon shows evil powerplant owner with 
overbite the dozing employees and a threeeyed fish named blinky 
all have contributed to driving industry officials into a critical 
mass but more than anything homer simpson has them glowing under 
the collar 
the us council for energy awareness an industry information 
group told the simpsons producers in a february letter it was 
horrified to see nuclear plant workers portrayed as bungling 
idiots 
top idiot on the councils list was homer father of the 
simpson family and an employee of the fictitious springfield 
nuclear plant homer perpetually in need of a shave seems to care 
less about safety than about naps doughnuts and having enough 
tartar sauce for his fish sticks 
in various episodes homer gives away the plants blueprints to 
a foreign exchange student his boss tries to bribe a plant 
inspector with a bushel of cash and threeeyed blinky is found 
swimming near the plant 
i am sorry that the simpsons has offended a lot of people in 
the energy industry executive producer sam simon said in a feb 
5 letter to carl goldstein a vice president of energy group i 
agree with you that in real life homer simpson would not be 
employed at a nuclear power plant 
on the other hand he probably wouldnt be employed 
anywhere 
after they exchanged a few more letters simon finally suggested 
he and other fox broadcasting co executives tour a real nuclear 
power plant 
we had no illusion that this was suddenly going to turn the 
simpsons into anything resembling real life and it hasnt 
goldstein said but they were interested 
in april the group converged on the san onofre nuclear power 
plant in san clemente calif 40 miles south of the fox los 
angeles offices 
we dont have any homers at our nuclear plant said david 
barron a spokesman for san onofres owner southern california 
edison who accompanied the producers and writers 
simon said the tour showed that the simpsons had been right 
and wrong about nuclear power 
although they did little initial research he said the 
simpsons creators seemed to accurately represent worker 
conditions the cafeterias lunch pails and radiation warning 
signs the writers placed homer in a sector to illustrate an 
impersonal bureaucracy then discovered some plants actually used 
that term 
but simon also said the tour also changed a lot of peoples 
minds i think the facts are pretty powerful that its a clean and 
safe and important source of energy while some of the shows were 
in the works before we really backed off that as a source of 
comedy no more threeeyed fish 
but dont have a cow simpsons fans 
the show will continue to jab the industry in its third season 
next year but in a more responsible way simon said 
for example homer is to begin a dinner grace with this thank 
you for nuclear power which has yet to cause a single fatality 
at least in this country 
plans even call for homer to avert a nuclear meltdown 
hes kind of asleep at the wheel and wakes up when theres an 
alarm and doesnt know which button to press so he goes 
eeneymeeneymineymo and hits a button and does avert a 
meltdown simon said he becomes a hero and feels guilty about 
it its not a politically charged episode 
the domestic industry has been sensitive about its image since 
one of the two three mile island reactors was crippled in a 1979 
accident that led to a 1 billion cleanup and in 1987 
pennsylvanias peach bottom plant was shut down for a time and 33 
workers fined on charges of sleeping andor inattention to 
duty 
asked if she watched the simpsons three mile island 
spokeswoman mary wells jokingly told a reporter goodbye but 
she relented and confessed she finds the show funny 
simon said the producers had a practical reason for placing 
homer at a power plant 
it was really just for the joke that this boob had a position 
where he could possibly make a mistake and destroy the world he 
said

the rebels who have taken power in chad 
announced an interim cabinet on wednesday that includes holdovers 
from the ousted regime as well as a former political prisoner 
a 33member council of state held its first meeting in the 
evening under the presidency of rebel commander idriss deby no 
communique was issued afterwards but one of the members who were 
given the titles of commissars said the council might stay in 
power at least year 
several chadian ambassadors abroad pledged to support the new 
leaders and france said it would keep a contingent of more than 
1000 troops in chad to defend the new government against any 
foreign aggression 
in ndjamena there were disclosures about secret prisons where 
opponents of ousted president hissene habre had been held nine 
bodies with hands tied together reportedly were found at various 
locations and taken to a morgue in the hope they could be 
identified 
amnesty international the londonbased human rights group 
alleged in march that habre had direct knowledge of detentions 
torture and summary executions of political prisoners 
residents said secret prisons had been found since habre fled 
saturday that had not been known about previously 
habre fled ndjamena following a threeweek offensive by the 
rebel forces of idriss deby whose party named him interim leader 
of chad on tuesday 
in a nationally broadcast speech deby 38 said he will 
establish a multiparty democracy in this african nation of 54 
million people a former french colony 
the names of the members of the interim cabinet were released 
wednesday they include top aides of deby but also the president 
of the nowdissolved national assembly jean alingue and two 
holdovers from habres cabinet justice minister abakar mallah and 
environment minister kotiga guerina 
the new comissar for higher education gali gata ngothe was 
a political prisoner until saturday 
chads ambassadors at embassies in france algeria egypt and 
sudan pledged loyalty to deby 
the ambassador to france allammi ahmad said the first steps 
taken by deby incontestably were measures in the direction of 
reconciliation civil peace and unity 
in paris french foreign minister roland dumas said deby has 
asked that france keep its troops in chad and that his request was 
granted 
the rebels received 40 percent of their weapons from libya 
french officials say but deby in his broadcast address ruled out 
any concessions regarding libyas claim to the aouzou strip a 
mineralrich region in northern chad 
we will defend our national unity the territorial integrity 
of chad within its borders inherited from colonization he said 
libya on wednesday pledged respect and noninterference in the 
internal affairs of chad according to libyas official news 
agency jana 
chad gained independence from france in 1960 france although 
it ha troops in chad as part of a pact with habre remained 
neutral during debys recent offensive 
habre took his family and eight cabinet ministers to maroua in 
cameroon according to the state newspaper the cameroon tribune he 
has made no public statements or appearances since his flight 
jana said habre and his entourage took three imprisoned libyan 
military officers with them when they fled chad and it asked that 
human rights organizations and the red cross work for their 
release 
officials in cameroon said some of habres ministers were 
preparing to return to ndjamena and reconcile themselves with 
deby 
deby was habres chief aide in a successful 1982 coup but broke 
away last year and formed a rebel movement habre and us 
officials claim libya actively backed debys rebellion but the 
libyans and deby deny it 
libyas army occupied northern chad in 1983 and 1986 prompting 
france to 6end troops to back habre libya was driven out in a 
series of battles masterminded by deby in 1987 
dumas during a cabinet meeting in paris said he received 
reports of agitation in northern chad and that supporters of 
former chadian president goukouni oueddei were involved oueddei 
has been based in libya since he was toppled by habre and deby in 
1982

us and soviet negotiators have resolved 
three big stumbling blocks as they work to complete a nuclear arms 
pact for president bush and mikhail s gorbachev to sign in moscow 
early next year us officials say 
the two sides in meetings over the last month have agreed to 
limit soviet backfire bombers outside the treaty to allow us 
nuclear programs with great britain to continue and to restrict the 
launch and payload weight of the soviets modernized groundbased 
ss18 missiles said an official who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity 
plans for bushs trip to moscow are on hold while the 
negotiators try to reach agreement on other technical matters 
involving inspection of weapons systems and interpretation of 
missile data 
the white house has said bush will go to moscow only if the 
treaty which aims to cut us and soviet arsenals of longrange 
nuclear weapons by 30 percent is ready for signing the pact will 
call for scrapping hundreds of warheads under close supervision 
experts from both sides will meet friday in washington to work 
on the remaining technical matters the session is a precursor to 
the meeting between secretary of state james a baker iii and 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze in houston on monday 
or tuesday 
the two are expected to thrash out their remaining differences 
and set a date for the moscow summit shevardnadze is to then fly 
to washington to see bush on wednesday 
recent negotiating sessions produced agreement on three of the 
outstanding differences holding up the pact known as start for 
strategic arms reduction treaty officials said 
specifically 
the united states agreed that the soviet backfire bomber can be 
counted separately from other strategic weapons under the 
agreement officials said a separate letter outside the actual 
start treaty would limit the number of backfires 
initially the united states had maintained the bombers had to be 
included in the overall start limits of 1600 heavy bombers and 
other ballistic missiles the soviets can retain said an official 
close to the talks 
the source declined to reveal the number of backfires that would 
be permitted the soviets have 355 backfires now according to an 
estimate by the international institute for strategic studies a 
londonbased think tank 
the soviets agreed to continued us nuclear programs with 
great britain as long as those programs are not seen as upsetting 
the overall strategic balance the cooperation primarily involves 
submarine technology and missiles the united states provides for 
british subs 
the negotiators have agreed that any modernized ss18 could not 
have the capability to carry heavier payloads including warheads 
than the current ss18 the treaty however would not limit 
modernization such as improved accuracy or fuel efficiency or 
alteration in the types of warheads 
under the pact the soviets would cut the number of ss18s by 
half to 154 
with those issues resolved administration officials are still 
cautious in predicting that the treaty will be ready for a january 
summit 
the remaining areas of disagreement however are not enough 
for anyone to fall on their sword over one us official said 
another official described the remaining issues as loose 
ends but said they are significant enough to block the 
agreement 
officials said that issues still to be worked out include 
primarily differences over 
monitoring of production facilities for mobile ballistic 
missiles the two nations disagree on where in the missile 
construction process should be allowed the united states wants 
assurances for early inspection of soviet ss24 missiles which 
have 10 warheads while the soviets have insisted that inspection 
of final assembly is sufficient 
to what extent each side must provide uncoded telemetry from 
testing of ballistic missiles so that the other can interpret the 
data and verify compliance with the treatys restrictions on 
missile performance 
whether the soviets will be allowed to inspect the b2 bomber 
to ensure it is not equipped to carry longrange airlaunched 
cruise missiles armed with nuclear weapons as the united states 
has assured them

scientists have cloned a gene that helps the 
electric ray deliver its stunning shocks an advance that may help 
in development of drugs to fight cystic fibrosis 
the gene tells cells how to make a protein called the chloride 
channel which transports electrically charged particles through 
the cell membrane 
in the ray that transport process is used to build up the 
voltage needed to stun enemies or prey 
human cells use a similar chloride channel for other purposes 
and in cystic fibrosis it fails to work properly that promotes 
development of a thick sticky mucus that sets the stage for fatal 
lung infections 
scientists may be able to use the newly cloned gene to isolate 
and purify a human chloride channel said robert beall the cystic 
fibrosis foundations executive vice president for medical affairs 
the human channel could then be used in research to screen 
potential drugs for treating cystic fibrosis he said other 
experiments could illuminate how the channel is regulated by the 
protein that is defective in cystic fibrosis yielding new insights 
that could point to possible therapies he said 
the cloning of the ray chloride channel is reported in 
thursdays issue of the british journal nature by scientists at 
hamburg university in germany the cystic fibrosis foundation 
helped pay for the work

women are more than twice as likely as men to 
suffer major depression because of factors ranging from sexual 
abuse to a passive way of thinking the american psychological 
association said wednesday 
biology plays only a minor role in the disproportionate rate of 
depression among women said the study of an apa task force it 
cited victimization unhappy marriages and cultural traditions 
shaped to diminish feminine worth as more serious causes 
ellen mcgrath a new york psychologist who chaired the study 
said that the apa committee deemed the findings dramatic no 
matter what the station in life black white rich poor 
educated or untrained all women are more at risk for depression 
than men she said 
bonnie strickland an university of massachusettsamherst 
professor of psychology and past president of the apa called 
untreated depression a major public health problem in the united 
states costing about 16 billion and leading to about 30000 
suicides annually 
one in every four women and one in every eight men will suffer 
a serious clinical depression at some time in their lives she 
said depression is chronic recurrent and the cost of human 
suffering is unfathomable 
one of the most astonishing findings is how often this gender 
difference is denied in the healthcare field said mcgrath 
what is usually said is that women are more ready to complain 
more able to talk about their feelings than men are and that women 
are more comfortable utilizing mental health services 
the task force study she said shows this does not hold 
there are true differences in depression between men and 
women said mcgrath the major reason seems to be culturally 
implemented biology is not as strong a factor as previously 
suspected 
strickland said the rates of depression are shifting more toward 
the young noting some studies show that as early as age 16 
american women begin to develop a passive view of themselves one 
of the major elements that can lead to depression illnesses 
the task force partially based its study on previous research 
worldwide on depression among women the group also conducted 
research of its own to draw its conclusions 
among them 
biology is not as strong an influence in womens depression as 
previously believed menstruation pregnancy abortion and 
menopause are not major factors in significant depression for most 
women infertility however is with up to 40 percent of women 
studied saying the inability to conceive is the most upsetting 
experience of their lives 
depression in women may be related to genderrelated 
personality styles that include passive dependent patterns and 
negative thinking but this requires more research 
the research suggests women focus too much on discussing 
depressed feelings instead of developing action and mastery 
strategies mcgrath said 
abuse early in life may play a large role the study said that 
between 37 percent and half of all women have had a significant 
experience of physical or sexual abuse before the age of 21 for 
many women depression may be the result of posttraumatic stress 
syndrome or even undiagnosed head trauma from battering 
unhappy marriages and parenthood are important factors the 
study said that women are three times more likely than men to be 
depressed in unhappy marriages and that having young children 
around creates a vulnerability to depression the more children 
in the house the more depression is reported the study said 
the report called poverty a pathway to depression it said 
that 75 percent of the us poor are women and children 
some groups of women are particularly susceptible the report 
said these include minorities elderly chemicallydependent 
lesbians and professional women it said these need special 
attention and support 
though depression now readily yields to treatment in 80 to 90 
percent of all patients most women with the ailment go untreated 
the report said and for those who are treated the depression is 
misdiagnosed at least 30 to 50 percent of the time the study 
said 
approximately 70 percent of the prescriptions for 
antidepressants are given to women often with improper diagnosis 
and monitoring the study said it recommended more research on 
the use of antidepressant drugs for women 
the apa task force included 34 women and five men the group 
included psychologists physicians mental health workers authors 
and editors and rep patricia schroeder dcolo

tim burton is young only 32 his hair is long 
too long falling over his face and sticking out at the sides his 
dreamy eyes gaze as if a movie screen is on the distant wall he 
has a lazy grin and a nervous unsettling laugh 
hardly the kind of person youd put in charge of a major motion 
picture but burton has managed quite well hes one of hollywoods 
hottest properties the director of the megabudget megasmash 
batman and the offbeat hit beetlejuice 
it makes perfect sense to him he simply points to his high 
school experience there were three kinds of male students he 
recalls athletes very popular with the girls academics 
preferred by the teachers and the freaks people meant 
perhaps to find themselves a little later in life 
i went to my 10year high school reunion a few years ago 
burton recalled in a recent interview it was so amazing some 
people peaked in high school everybody i saw who was considered an 
outcast i didnt see one example where this wasnt true they were 
incredibly attractive and successful 
you got to get it out some way if you get everything you 
want youre not going to have those desires you dont have that 
eternal conflict of getting something out 
his new film edward scissorhands is a holiday fable about 
a freak johnny depp rescued from his brokendown mansion high 
above town and taken to the nice suburban home of a friendly avon 
lady dianne wiest 
a punk in whiteface and black leather edward was constructed by 
an aging scientist vincent price of course who died before he 
could make a pair of hands an array of scissors are there instead 
the neighbors all take to wiests unusual guest who endears 
himself by using his hands to artfully trim hedges poodles and 
womens hair but edward also has a soul hes in love with 
wiests beautiful and popular daughter winona ryder depps 
girlfriend in real life and must fight nasty boyfriend anthony 
michael hall for her affection 
its a classic fairy tale an image of creation and of 
destruction beauty and horror touching and not touching burton 
said its an externalization of how you feel at odds with 
yourself twosided 
beetlejuice fans will appreciate the campy sets with 
brightly painted monochromatic houses as well as matching clothes 
and billboards food too burton says he was trying to be funny 
and also wanted to make a point how people see others on just one 
level applying catchall phrases that deny any complexity 
people say youre this youre that i think theres a 
necessity for people to categorize i think it helps make them 
comfortable and some of the weirdest people ive known get it the 
worst if people cant put you into a category theyre inclined to 
just write you off as a freak 
burton who grew up in burbank calif watched sciencefiction 
and horror films as a kid and first showed talent as an artist by 
designing an antilitter poster in ninth grade that graced the 
sides of local garbage trucks 
after high school he attended the california institute of the 
arts on a disney fellowship and soon joined walt disney studios as 
an animator working on the fox and the hound and the black 
cauldron 
price was the inspiration and the narrator for his first 
film vincent an animated short completed when the director 
was just 23 his next project was frankenweenie his first live 
action film 
it happened just by osmosis that need to want to do 
something i didnt care how it manifested itself i didnt care if 
it was drawing animation whatever animation was a little too 
tedious for me live action was better because it was immediate and 
helped me come out of my shell he said 
he followed with peewees big adventure and then 
beetlejuice the wacky ghost story that helped make stars of 
ryder michael keaton geena davis and alec baldwin 
the script had no story burton recalled it was 
incredibly vague and contradicted itself all over the place i 
cant to this day say if it was good or not you just felt 
someones personality in it 
burtons confident hell keep getting better he thinks history 
hollywood history is on his side some of the great directors 
john huston billy wilder preston sturges hadnt even made films 
at his age hes still developing still learning to express

miss saigon producer cameron mackintosh who 
already has fought with actors equity over ethnic casting is 
seeking permission to cast a filipino actress in the broadway 
version of the hit london musical 
the actress lea salonga played the role of kim a vietnamese 
bargirl in the british production but she would need the unions 
approval to appear in the united states 
mackintosh battled the actors union last summer when it turned 
down his request to allow british actor jonathan pryce to recreate 
his starring role of a eurasian pimp the ban stirred debate over 
colorblind casting and minority opportunities on stage 
the producer then canceled the 10 million show but changed his 
mind when the union relented allowing pryce to appear here 
the agreement between mackintosh and the union allowed the 
producer to hire two nonamerican asian performers for the musical 
but said he must get special permission to let salonga star in new 
york 
mackintosh also agreed not to use yellowface makeup or facial 
devices designed to simulate asian eyes in any us production and 
to try to recruit asianamerican actors for lesser roles in the 
show 
mackintosh traveling in australia could not be reached for 
comment his spokesman marc thibodeau confirmed wednesday the 
request to the union 
more than 10 open auditions in new york los angeles san 
francisco vancouver british columbia and elsewhere have been 
held specifically for the role of kim he said salonga was chosen 
for the london production after a worldwide search 
a union committee will consider mackintoshs request for 
salonga said union spokeswoman helaine feldman but no date for 
the meeting has been set 
if rejected the producer could appeal to the unions 79member 
council if that request also is denied the matter could go to 
arbitration 
of the nearly 50 performers in the large cast 34 roles are 
played by ethnic minority actors including 27 asians 
miss saigon set during the closing days of the vietnam war 
has sold a record 30 million in advance tickets it is scheduled 
to open april 11 1991 at the broadway theater

the group called the national salvation committee demanded 
that the armed forces be asked to help halt the nations slide into 
chaos but gorbachevs main rival boris yeltsin said he was 
opposed to using the military to resolve the crisis 
the salvation committees members included the hardline soyuz 
group of parliamentarians as well as the reformist 
liberaldemocratic party 
there are many fascist elements emerging in many parts of the 
country and this process should be stopped before it is too 
late said vladimir zhirinovsky a leader of the 
liberaldemocratic party and a spokesman for the national salvation 
committee 
the committee called the military the sole force still 
resisting the disintegration of the state the independent 
interfax news agency reported 
leaders demanded shifting power to the committee if gorbachev 
did not act interfax and the state news agency tass reported 
gorbachev must assume this responsibility or we should find an 
alternative said vladimir voronin leader of the sakharov 
democratic union and a committee member 
he said in a telephone interview that the committee wanted a 
strengthening of presidential power 
the group is calling for suspension of the parliaments of 
lithuania moldavia georgia and russia because they are seen as 
the strongest challenge to the central government zhirinovsky said 
in a telephone interview 
other committee members seemed inclined to suspend all 
legislative bodies 
if presidential decrees are not obeyed in a region that 
regions representative bodies should be dissolved and a 
plenipotentiary representative of the central government should be 
sent to replace it said voronin 
the lithuanian parliament declared independence on march 11 and 
the newly elected noncommunist parliament of georgia is moving in 
that direction moldavia is split among opposing ethnic groups 
the russian republic issued the strongest challenge by declaring 
itself sovereign with the right to overturn national laws on its 
territory threequarters of the soviet land mass 
zhirinovsky said the coalition represented 400 of the 2250 
members of the congress of peoples deputies and included members 
of the soviet peace committee the russian national front and the 
communist party 
he said the proposal for introducing a state of emergency 
starting jan 1 would be introduced at the next session of the 
congress on dec 17 
tass said the groups program surprised journalists and even 
some members of the bloc who were already disagreeing with some 
provisions during the press conference 
sentiment for a crackdown is widespread in the communist party 
which holds a majority in most legislative bodies on the national 
and local level many communists want gorbachev to call a state of 
emergency and enforce it through the armed forces and the kgb 
security police 
the national salvation committee seemed to have the same goals 
although they were not spelled out clearly during the news 
conference called to announce the groups formation 
the soviet economy is crumbling the old central system is 
failing and grocery shelves in major cities are bare 
with all but one of the 15 soviet republics seeking some form of 
independence or autonomy from central government many officials 
fear the collapse of the union 
yeltsin president of the russian republic and gorbachevs main 
rival warned officers at the dzerzhinsky military academy in 
moscow against a military coup 
if the army enters our boiling society as an active factor 
confrontation will increase many times and carry the society to 
catastrophe he said 
first of all the army cannot solve the economic problem and 
today the economy is the greatest concern he said 
yeltsin said any interference by the army in internal 
political affairs will simply blow up the army from inside it 
could split into small groups fighting each other 
the tough political struggle which today remains peaceful 
could grow into an armed conflict he said taking into account 
that we are a nuclear power such a development would immediately 
create a threat not only to life in our country but in the whole 
world 
yeltsin has led the drive for shifting power from the central 
government to the republics as a result hardliners feel he has 
contributed to forces splintering the country

iraqi president saddam hussein was reportedly offering wednesday 
to put all issues on the negotiating table but president bush 
said hes not optimistic about prospects for an iraqi withdrawal 
from kuwait 
saddams latest surprise came as top bush administration aides 
warned that iraq must pull out of kuwait or face the prospect of a 
devastating military strike 
israel too gave saddam one of its most forceful warnings to 
date saying it would destroy his security hurt him until he is 
sorry if he used current peace moves as a cover for aggression 
against the jewish state 
the cable news network said saddam was feeling enormous pressure 
to withdraw from kuwait and quoted a ranking iraqi source it did 
not identify as saying all issues are on the table 
everything 
bush on a south american visit was asked about the report 
im not optimistic i see no evidence saddam hussein is 
willing to comply fully with the un resolutions he told 
reporters in argentina those resolutions call for an unconditional 
withdrawal of iraqi troops from the emirate the freeing of foreign 
hostages and the restoration of the former kuwaiti government 
the report and word from the state department that iraq had 
formally accepted an offer for talks sent crude oil prices for 
january delivery down more than 3 a barrel to 2729 on the new 
york mercantile exchange that was the lowest level since august 
the month iraq invaded kuwait 
the bush administration had offered last week to send secretary 
of state james a baker iii to baghdad and invited iraqi foreign 
minister tariq aziz to washington iraq indicated earlier it would 
accept and the state department announcement formalized that the 
department said the dates were being worked out 
the bush administration has said the talks are to reiterate what 
un resolutions say and are not meant to be wideranging 
negotiations iraq says it wants to bring in other middle east 
issues including the arabisraeli conflict but the bush 
administration has ruled that out 
moscow meanwhile was making conciliatory moves agreeing to 
discuss compensation payments to iraq the move came as the baghdad 
government prepared to begin freeing more than 3200 soviet 
citizens 
the soviets are among thousands of foreigners who were trapped 
by iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait on wednesday a group of 
american women arrived in baghdad and said they hoped to win the 
release of their hostage husbands 
saddam told us if we come here we will not go back 
emptyhanded said dawn bazner of detroit after arriving in the 
iraqi capital 
the state department has discouraged private hostagefreeing 
missions saying the emissaries put themselves in danger and also 
risk being used for propaganda purposes 
in a series of statements wednesday baker cia director william 
webster and gen colin l powell chairman of the joint chiefs of 
staff all took a tough position on what might happen if iraq 
refuses to give up kuwait 
the united states is not going to blink on this one powell 
said in a speech at a london research institute 
if we have to use force if it comes to that the united 
states intends to use overwhelming force to win decisively as 
quickly as possible with as few casualties as possible he said 
baker appearing before the senate foreign relations committee 
stopped short of saying the united states would strike militarily 
if iraq still holds kuwait after jan 15 the deadline for 
withdrawal established last week by the united nations security 
council 
but if force must be used it will be used suddenly massively 
and decisively he said 
baker said so far unimposed sanctions have had little effect 
on iraqs inclination to withdraw from kuwait which it overran 
aug 2 
webster voiced similar sentiments in an appearance before the 
house armed services committee he said it would be risky to rely 
on sanctions alone to get iraq to relinquish kuwait 
there is no assurance or guarantee that economic hardships 
will compel saddam to change his policies he said 
congress has been pressing the administration to seek its 
approval before going to war in the gulf 
in baghdad a soviet diplomat said more than 200 exit visas were 
issued wednesday for soviet citizens and that an evacuation flight 
was set for thursday 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman vitaly churkin said the 
kremlin was willing to discuss compensation payments for iraq for 
allowing soviet citizens to leave before their work contracts 
expired 
the baghdad government made its demand for compensation earlier 
this week when it announced more than 3200 soviet experts would 
be allowed to go home 
the israeli warning to saddam came from foreign minister david 
levy in remarks to lawmakers his coments reflected the apparent 
unease of israeli officials at the prospect of a resolution of the 
gulf crisis that would leave the iraqi presidents army and 
missiles intact 
if anyone thinks that through some maneuver in the name of 
peace he will be able to continue to threaten with the aim of 
surprising israel he will find israel ready always with its 
might to destroy his security to hurt him until he is sorry and 
regrets his action levy said 
british officials said wednesday a 57yearold british man held 
by irq at a strategic site had died in captivity he died tuesday 
of an apparent heart attack they said

a newly elected state legislator must give 
up his seat when he goes to serve in the persian gulf with his 
national guard unit under a ban included in the state constitution 
robert porter is a member of the guards 744th transportation 
company which was called up last month 
the state constitution bars legislators from serving while they 
are on active military duty republican house speaker harold burns 
says thats unfair 
if youve done the patriotic thing and gone to serve to have 
your house seat taken away from you is ridiculous he said 
thats one of the worst things ive ever heard its almost evil 
and i would do everything in my power to change it 
porter a republican couldnt be sworn in wednesday along with 
other house members because he is training at fort devens in ayer 
mass 
burns said he would support a change in the constitution to 
ensure lawmakers who are called to serve will still have their 
seats when they return he and other republican leaders say they 
hope no one calls for a special election to fill porters seat 
changing the constitution requires either a vote by the 
legislature or a constitutional convention vote in either case 
voters must ratify the change 
we could change this in 1992 but unfortunately that doesnt 
help rep porter burns said

here are excerpts from the opening statement 
of secretary of state james a baker iii before the senate foreign 
relations committee on wednesday 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
from the outset the international community has rallied behind 
four objectives first the immediate complete and unconditional 
iraqi withdrawal from kuwait second the restoration of kuwaits 
legitimate government third the release of all hostages and 
fourth a commitment to the security and stability of the gulf 
the president has stated repeatedly mr chairman that we want 
to achieve these objectives peacefully he has also made clear that 
we seek to achieve them at the least cost to ourselves and at the 
least cost to other members of the international coalition 
from the outset our strategy to achieve these objectives has 
been to make saddam hussein pay such a high price for his 
aggression that he would quit kuwait we have aimed to impose costs 
on him for his aggression by taking increasingly harsh steps on a 
continuum of pressure and pain politically economically and 
militarily on this continuum economic sanctions and military 
preparations are not alternatives but are really reinforcing and 
escalating steps of the same strategy 
notwithstanding our desire for peace from the outset we have 
proceeded with the full realization that if these objectives cannot 
be achieved peacefully then we really must be prepared to use 
force given the vital interests that we have at stake 
to date the international coalition has had considerable 
success in isolating iraq and in making it pay high costs for its 
occupation of kuwait we regret the pain that this causes the 
innocent citizens of iraq a people with whom we have no quarrel 
but the question before us now is whether the costs we impose on 
saddam hussein through sanctions alone will be high enough to cause 
him to withdraw peacefully from kuwait 
mr chairman we have to face the fact that four months into 
this conflict none of our efforts have yet produced any sign of 
change in saddam hussein he shows no signs of complying with any 
of the security council resolutions instead he appears to be 
doubling his bets 
he has tried to make kuwait part of iraq systematically looting 
and dismembering a sovereign arab state he has been terrorizing 
the population his soldiers committing unspeakable crimes against 
innocent kuwaitis 
he has called for the overthrow of king fahd of saudi arabia and 
president mubarak of egypt he has threatened to rain terror and 
mass destruction on his arab neighbors as well as on israel and 
he has been playing the cruelest of games with hostages and their 
families and with our diplomats in kuwait 
after serious and sobering consultations the united nations 
security council last thursday passed by an overwhelming majority 
a 12th resolution one that authorizes all necessary means 
including the use of force to eject iraq from kuwait after january 
15 1991 
in passing this resolution the international community is 
giving saddam yet another chance indeed one last chance to 
come to his senses 
in passing thursdays resolution the international community 
sends the following clear message we continue to seek a diplomatic 
solution peace is your only sensible option you can choose peace 
by respecting the will of the international community but if you 
fail to do so you will risk all the choice is yours 
to ensure mr chairman that he understands this choice the 
president has invited the foreign minister of iraq to washington 
and has directed me to go to baghdad put bluntly this is the 
last best chance for a peaceful solution if we are to have any 
chance of success i must go to baghdad mr chairman with the 
full support of the congress and the american people behind the 
message of the international community 
let me be clear this meeting will not be the beginning of a 
negotiation over the terms of the united nations resolutions those 
terms are clear a complete immediate and unconditional 
withdrawal from kuwait the restoration of the legitimate kuwaiti 
government and the release of all foreign nationals 
nor is this the beginning of a negotiation on subjects which are 
unrelated to iraqs brutal occupation of kuwait i will not be 
negotiating the palestinian question or the civil war in lebanon 
saddam hussein did not invade kuwait to help the palestinians 
he did it for his own selfaggrandizement and as eduard 
shevardnadze has said mr chairman you do not enslave one people 
to free another 
put simply my mission to baghdad will be an attempt to explain 
to saddam the choice he faces comply with the objectives of the 
security council or risk disaster for iraq 
to give substance to these words the president has directed the 
secretary of defense the chairman of the joint chiefs and me to 
work with the other members of the international coalition to 
reinforce the multinational force in the gulf and to coordinate its 
efforts our aim is to ensure that if force must be used it will 
be used suddenly massively and decisively 
do the troop reinforcements and the security council resolution 
mean that war is inevitable surely not there is a peaceful 
solution possible one that does not reward aggression and 
everyone including saddam hussein knows what that is he can 
choose peace by withdrawing unconditionally from kuwait and by 
releasing all hostages 
he will not make that peaceful choice however in our opinion 
unless he understands that the alternative to peaceful compliance 
is that he will be forced to comply that is the message that we 
are trying in every way we know how to send him that is the 
meaning of the steps the international community has taken over the 
past month it is not a new strategy but rather a continuation 
and reinforcement of the strategy that we have been pursuing since 
august 
now i know that some here and throughout the country are very 
uneasy about the prospects of war mr chairman no one wants war 
none of us not you not the president not me none of us none of 
us though have sought this conflict and we are making every 
attempt possible to resolve it peacefully to resolve it peacefully 
without appeasing the aggressor 
i know the arguments of those who believe that time and the 
economic embargo alone will work to resolve this conflict 
peacefully but i think we have to face some very hard facts if 
sanctions are to succeed theyve got to do more than simply hurt 
iraq economically they must hurt iraq so much that saddam hussein 
changes his behavior and withdraws from kuwait that is the 
criterion of success by which sanctions must be judged 
in considering the role of sanctions and our strategy we need 
to ask ourselves can economic sanctions alone compel a dictator 
like saddam hussein to make the politically difficult choice of 
withdrawing from kuwait absent a credible military threat will he 
take the security councils actions seriously is there anything in 
saddam husseins history that could lead us to believe that 
sanctions alone would get him out of kuwait

americans and canadians of polish origin are not 
eligible to vote in the second round of polands presidential 
elections an official at the polish consulate here said wednesday 
the second election takes place only in poland said the 
official krzysztof smyk that is the polish law 
smyk said the consulate has not received any complaints about 
sundays balloting because people know the regulations we 
informed them in the first round of voting 
this regulation was undertaken by the polish parliament before 
the voting began 
but some polish canadians are disappointed they wont be able to 
vote said janusz sukiennik editorinchief of the torontobased 
polish alliance press 
i can feel some disappointment among the people especially 
now when the campaign is getting emotional but that is the law 
and we can not change it 
presidential candidate lech walesa was easily leading emigre 
businessman stanislaw tyminski who holds canadian and peruvian 
citizenship in the latest poll with 61 percent versus 20 percent 
for tyminski 
the controversial tyminski who only returned to his homeland 
this fall after 21 years overseas took second place over tadeusz 
mazowiecki in the first round of voting on nov 25 eliminating the 
prime minister from this weeks runoff 
about 5000 polish canadians cast their ballots in toronto in 
the first round of voting 
it was unknown how many polish americans cast their vote

and mr chairman if i might let me try to answer these 
questions based on the results so far after four months of a 
stringent embargo no one doubts that sanctions are having some 
effect on the iraqi economy but we have o face the difficult 
fact i think that no one can tell you that sanctions alone will 
ever be able to impose a high enough cost on saddam hussein to get 
him to withdraw 
so far all available evidence suggests that they have had 
little if any effect on his inclination to withdraw thats in 
part because saddam to a considerable extent can decide who in 
iraq gets hurt by the sanctions and you can bet the iraqi people 
will feel the pain first and most deeply not the iraqi military 
and not the government of iraq itself 
saddam has a long history of imposing great pain and suffering 
on the iraqi people it is not new for him to impose economic 
sacrifices on the iraqi people in pursuit of his ambitions so we 
need to remember who it is we are trying to get out of kuwait 
he is a ruthless dictator he has an inflated sense of iraqs 
leverage and a very high pain threshold he undoubtedly believes he 
can endure economic sanctions however surely he understands more 
acutely the consequence or the consequences of military force 
waiting not only gives him time to break the sanctions but 
waiting mr chairman imposes costs on us as we wait saddam will 
continue torturing kuwait and continue killing it as a nation 
as we wait he will continue manipulating hostages attempting 
to break the coalition as we wait he will continue to fortify 
kuwait he will continue to build chemical and biological weapons 
and he will continue his efforts to acquire a nuclear weapons 
capability as we wait he expects other issues to deflect our 
attention to weaken our resolve and to dissolve the international 
coalition and as we wait mr chairman his crime weighs heavier 
on the world 
and so that is why we think we must make credible our 
preparations to use force the international community has clearly 
agreed that force will not be used before january 15 of next year 
provided of course that there is no provocation in the 
intervening time frame thus mr chairman we need to remind 
ourselves that for now no one is making a decision about going to 
war indeed in asking me to go to baghdad the president has made 
it clear that he will use the next six weeks to exhaust all 
diplomatic opportunities 
but to support these diplomatic efforts mr chairman the 
president has also made it clear that we need continued support for 
our military preparations to make credible an offensive option to 
liberate kuwait 
while not prejudging any decision whether force should be used 
sometime after january 15 i can state unequivocally that failure 
to continue preparations now has at least three dangerous 
consequences first it would undercut our diplomatic leverage by 
removing the other alternative to a peaceful withdrawal which is 
use of force it would send iraq exactly the wrong message that 
is continue to play for time youll have lots of it because the 
security council resolution is just a bluff the international 
coalition is not even preparing the option to use force let alone 
take that option 
that is a message mr chairman that we should not and must not 
send we must show saddam hussein that time is not on his side he 
needs to know that even if he believes he can withstand the 
sanctions and he may well be right in this belief we can and will 
impose even greater costs on him through the use of force if that 
is necessary 
secondly the failure to prepare a credible offensive military 
option would only tend to reaffirm the status quo and to legitimize 
to some the brutal occupation that he is now carrying out against 
kuwait and its people 
third the failure to prepare adequately now would mean that 
should conflict come we would be irresponsibly risking greater 
casualties putting the lives of those young americans already on 
the front lines in the persian gulf at greater risk than they need 
to be the president will not stand for that and neither mr 
chairman i submit will the american people 
mr chairman we do not proceed along this pass unaware of the 
dangers and the risks that are involved but let there be no doubt 
that succeeding in this endeavor hopefully in peace if necessary 
by force is in the vital interests of the american people it is 
often said that there has been no clear answer given to the 
question of why we are in the gulf 
much of this i think results from the search for a single 
cause for our involvement a single reason the president could use 
to explain why the lives of american men and women should be put in 
harms way in the sands of arabia on the seas around it or in the 
air above it 
mr chairman lets stop this search and lets be honest with 
ourselves and with each other there are multiple causes there are 
multiple dangers there are multiple threats and standing alone 
each is compelling but you put them all together and the case is 
overwhelming put very bluntly a very dangerous dictator armed to 
the teeth is threatening a critical region at a defining moment in 
history it is the combination of these reasons that is who is 
threatening our interests what capabilities he has and is 
developing where he is carrying out his aggression and when he 
has chosen to act that make the stakes so very high for all of us 
let me explain strategically this man is a capricious dictator 
whose lust for power is as unlimited as his brutality in the 
pursuit of it he has invaded two neighbors he is harboring 
terrorists and now is systematically exterminating kuwait he uses 
poison gas even against his own people he develops deadly toxins 
and he seeks relentlessly to acquire nuclear bombs he has built 
the worlds sixth largest army has the worlds fifth largest tank 
army and has deployed ballistic missiles 
geographically saddams aggression has occurred in a political 
tinderbox that is crossroads to three continents his success would 
only guarantee more strife more conflict and eventually a wider 
war there would be little hope for any effort at peacemaking in 
the middle east 
economically his aggression imperils the worlds oil lifelines 
here and abroad hitting hardest those fledgling democracies that 
are least able to cope with it his aggression is an attempt to 
mortgage the economic promise of the postcold war world to the 
whims of a single man 
morally we must act so that international laws not 
international outlaws govern the postcold war world we must act 
so that right not might dictates success in the postcold war 
world we must act so that innocent men and women and diplomats are 
protected not held hostage in the postcold war world 
historically we must stand with the people of kuwait so that 
the annexation of kuwait does not become the first reality that 
mars our vision of a new world order we must stand with the world 
community so that the united nations does not go the same way as 
the league of nations 
politically mr chairman finally politically we must stand 
for american leadership not because we seek it but simply 
because no one else can do the job and we did not stand united for 
40 years to bring the cold war to a peaceful end in order to make 
the world safe for the likes of saddam hussein 
so these then are the stakes mr chairman if he is not 
stopped now if his aggressive designs are not frustrated 
peacefully if possible or if necessary by force we will all pay a 
much higher price later on as the security council did last 
thursday this congress and the american people must tell saddam 
hussein in unmistakable actions and words get out of kuwait now or 
risk all 
mr chairman now more than at any time during this conflict it 
is important that we stand united with the world community in full 
support of the united nations security council resolutions simply 
put it is a choice between whats right and whats wrong between 
whats right and whats wrong and mr chairman i think that we 
have the courage and the fortitude to do whats right thank you 
very much

a globetrotting saudi prince has run 
afoul of a florida hotel that claims his highness failed to pay for 
damages left during a stay last spring 
prince turki bin abdul aziz al saud the youngest of king fahds 
six brothers who now occupies two floors of the charles hotel in 
cambridge with his retinue of 65 is being sued by the hyatt 
regency grand cypress hotel in orlando fla 
during a nearly monthlong stay in more than 30 rooms last 
spring the prince and his entourage scratched pianos left stains 
and damaged a ceiling the hotel alleges 
the lawsuit filed in orlando circuit court also says the prince 
failed to pick up the tab for hyatt guests who had to be moved to 
other rooms after the royal family extended its stay twice the 
hotel is seeking 20000 in charges and damages 
originally the hyatt management had been willing to accept 
7500 for the damages said denis l durkin a lawyer for the 
hotel the royal family accepted the offer but never paid he said 
james a hauser a lawyer for prince turki on wednesday called 
the lawsuit a misunderstanding that arose because hotel management 
failed to bring the damages to the attention of the princes 
administrative staff 
there was never a problem while the family was staying 
there hauser said after they left there arose some 
allegations or claims for repairs and relocation expenses 
but none of those items had ever been brought to the attention 
of the royal family or the man who pays the bills its one of 
those things where the communication doesnt make it from a to b to 
c 
hauser said he expected the lawsuit would be resolved quickly 
the prince who has started a public relations campaign to 
change his image as troublesome has managed to stay on good terms 
with management at the charles 
everything here is fine said hotel spokeswoman martha 
sullivan we think hes a model guest and we have no 
complaints 
still others have complained 
in october cambridge residents complained that the princes 
security guards ejected local children from a park during royal 
family visits they also claimed the saudis drove stretch 
limousines across newlyseeded athletic fields

scientists plan to install a 4 million 
observatory on an underwater volcano complete with cameras 
microphones and seismometers to monitor the gradual birth of the 
next hawaiian island 
university of hawaii researchers hope the hawaiian undersea 
geoobservatory or hugo will be in place on loihi seamount within 
two years using its instruments to study earthquakes and 
eruptions geology and geophysics professor fred k duennebier said 
wednesday 
its a good idea to monitor undersea volcanoes said bob 
tilling a us geological survey volcanologist more than half 
the worlds volcanoes are on the sea floor the challenge is to 
capture one of these erupting because we havent done that yet 
loihi is a rugged steepsided submarine volcano about 22 miles 
southeast of the island of hawaii it rises roughly 11200 feet 
above the surrounding sea floor its cratered summit is now about 
3300 feet beneath the surface of the pacific duennebier said 
volcanologists are certain it is active but havent actually 
observed an eruption intense earthquake activity suggests 
eruptions happened in 1986 1988 and early this year duennebier 
said during the american geophysical unions fall meeting 
it will be the next hawaiian island in about 50000 years or 
so once eruptions build the summit above the oceans surface he 
added i wouldnt buy real estate yet 
the observatory will be a network of 20 or more cameras and 
instruments plugged into electrical boxes located on a system of 
electrooptical cables draped across loihis summit and slopes 
like tvs lamps and stereo equipment linked by extension cords in 
someones living room 
hugo will be connected to the big island by another cable that 
will provide power and also carry data from the observatory to a 
recording station and scientists on shore 
duennebier said that once a ship lays the cable and boxes 
unmanned remotecontrolled submarines and manned submersible 
vehicles will plug cameras microphones seismometers and heat and 
chemical sensors into the network 
scientists who study the sea floor now usually use instruments 
that are dropped off ships fall to the ocean floor record 
scientific data on tape and then are recovered by ships 
duennebier said hugos instruments will have the advantage of 
being able to collect data on quakes and eruptions and send the 
information to land immediately if a camera or instrument breaks 
down or becomes obsolete a submersible vehicle or 
remotecontrolled submarine can retrieve it and install a new one 
the observatory will be able to collect pictures and information 
for at least 10 years unless it is buried by undersea lava flows or 
landslides duennebier said he said the instruments would be 
placed in areas where they are least likely to be damaged 
during the apparent eruption of loihi in 1986 the university 
installed seven temporary seismometers on loihis slopes they 
detected thousands of earthquakes at the rate of about three daily 
while seismometers on land detected only three per month 
duennebier said that shows the value of installing a permanent 
observatory like hugo 
the hawaiian islands were created by a hot spot a plume of 
molten rock that rises from deep inside the earth as a giant plate 
of earths crust was dragged over the hot spot volcanic eruptions 
from the hot spot formed each of the islands in succession 
loihi is now over the hot spot which also has branches feeding 
hawaiis kilauea and mauna loa volcanoes 
the network of cables and electrical plugin boxes for the 
observatory will cost roughly 4 million although about twothirds 
of that cost has been donated by atampt co in the form of 25 miles 
of undersea cable and the use of a cablelaying ship to install it 
the university also got 100000 of 25 million it requested 
for the project from the national science foundation duennebier 
and his colleague oceanographer alexander malahoff hope to use 
that money to start buying cameras and monitoring instruments for 
the observatory 
because the observatory will be equipped with numerous plugin 
boxes many other researchers will be able to install their own 
instruments on loihi duennebier said

saddam hussein said wednesday that iraq 
wants dialogue with other nations but he indicated a settlement in 
the persian gulf still hinges on a larger solution to mideast 
problems 
the official iraqi news agency monitored in nicosia said 
president saddam told visiting european parliamentarians that iraq 
rejects ultimatums from the bush administration 
bush has demanded that iraq withdraw from kuwait without 
precondition and has threatened through the passage of a un 
resolution last week to wage war if iraqi forces havent left 
kuwaiti territory by jan 15 iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 and 
days later declared it to be an iraqi province 
what guarantees legitimate interests among people and honest 
ties among nations is not threats the use of force or bribes but 
the building of a human bridge based on love the iraqi news 
agency quoted saddam as saying 
the foundations of this bridge should be dialogue and 
interaction through dialogue to attain a common understanding and 
solutions based on convictions 
it said saddam stressed iraqs determination to confront any 
attempt to threaten intimidate and brandish the use of brute 
force regardless of the direction from which it comes 
in argentina bush said wednesday he is not optimistic that 
a peaceful solution can be found the chairman of the joint chiefs 
of staff gen colin powell said in london that america is not 
going to blink on this one 
iraq has insisted that any solution must include a settlement of 
such mideast problems as the palestinian homeland it argues that 
enforcing un security council resolutions against iraq but not 
those against israel represents an unacceptable double standard 
saddam reiterated the link between the gulf crisis and other 
mideast problems tuesday during a meeting in baghdad with king 
hussein of jordan palestine liberation organization chairman 
yassir arafat and yemeni vice president ali salem albeidh 
the iraqi news agency said the four leaders welcome dialogue but 
affirmed their commitment to work toward solving all the problems 
in the area particularly over the palestinians in israel 
the united states and the other countries contributing to the 
antiiraqi multinational force have rejected linking the gulf 
crisis to other mideast problems 
the iraqi news agency also said saddam criticized bush during 
the meeting with the europeans 
the president of a state that claims to be free and democratic 
does not have the right to turn into an informing policeman at the 
un security council he has to seek dialogue this is what iraq 
wants saddam was quoted as saying 
also wednesday the cable news network quoted a ranking iraqi 
source it did not identify as saying all issues are on the 
table everything it said saddam was feeling enormous pressure 
to withdraw from kuwait

the business newspaper commersant on wednesday 
published a map of neighborhoods in the soviet capital that it said 
are controlled by 10 major criminal organizations and ran a whos 
who of moscow racketeers 
the weekly said whenever the supply of a product is forcibly 
kept below demand such as narcotics in the west or alcohol during 
prohibition organized crime steps in and thrives 
but in a country such as the soviet union where virtually 
everything is difficult to obtain the opportunities for organized 
crime are endless couple that with an overstretched police force 
and you have an explosive situation 
commersant said it got its information from anonymous 
informants it said journalists who wrote the stories didnt want 
their names used for fear of gangland retribution 
the paper said it sent a copy of its map and stories in advance 
to moscows internal affairs department for comment and the 
department replied two days later that organized crime does not 
exist as such in moscow 
but commersant said organized crime controls some or all of 
moscows drug trade prostitution slot machines video salons and 
usedcar sales its main business however is extorting protection 
money the paper reported mostly from restaurants and other 
semiprivate enterprises 
boris pugo the countrys new interior minister told the 
government newspaper izvestia on tuesday that president mikhail s 
gorbachev is very concerned with the rise in organized crime 
however the struggle with this crime hasnt been effective enough 
so far 
corruption has penetrated all organizations all bodies of 
power including the highest echelons pugo said 
commersant said the two biggest and most senior gangs in moscow 
held a 1988 gangster summit to divide up the city spelling out 
who would operate where that attempt soon broke down it said and 
now 10 major gangs operate it said they are known as teams or 
brigades and involve about 6000 criminals 
the paper gave this breakdown 
the assyrian brigade monopolizes illegal drug trade operating 
out of the central krasnaya presnya district home to the moscow 
zoo and embassies 
the dolgoprudnay brigade specializes in racketeering 
especially protection it controls northern moscow and parts of the 
olympic village 
the solntsevo brigade victimizes usedcar sales people and is 
moving in on extorting protection money from cab drivers it 
recently staked a claim on yuzhny port on the moscow river 
the lyubertsy and chechen brigades share prostitution 
antons brigade runs loansharking and controls downtown moscow 
all the video salons and revenues from pop music shows 
one brigade leader controls the income from all slot machines

relations between saudi arabia and 
the soviet union are blossoming due to the persian gulf crisis 
with both countries eager to open embassies and a 
multibilliondollar loan to the soviets reportedly in the works 
the swift rapprochement follows nearly 60 years of diplomatic 
standoff between moscow and riyadh which had no formal ties since 
the severing of relations by josef stalin in 1932 
the two nations now have much at stake in the swift development 
of relations reestablished by saudi arabia on sept 17 
the saudis hope to ensure soviet support for the multinational 
coalition arrayed against iraq once one of moscows closest 
allies the soviets for their part are counting on financial help 
from the oilrich arab kingdom to ease their economic crisis 
according to official sources the soviets plan to send a 
delegation to riyadh this month to look for embassy premises and 
hold talks on a badly needed loan 
a saudi delegation led by the foreign ministrys undersecretary 
for financial and administrative affairs mohammed hussein 
abdulwali has been shopping in moscow for a suitable site for a 
saudi embassy said the sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the saudi foreign minister prince saud alfaisal an infrequent 
visitor to moscow was in the soviet capital in the critical days 
before the un security council approved a resolution on nov 30 
authorizing military force against iraq 
finance minister mohammed abalkhail was part of that delegation 
sparking reports of negotiations for a multibilliondollar saudi 
loan to the soviet union and even heftier assistance from the six 
oilrich states forming the gulf cooperation council 
the unofficial reports mentioned loans of 1 billion to 45 
billion from saudi arabia alone 
kuwait has had relations with moscow since shortly after gaining 
independence from britain in 1961 for years it tried to influence 
its conservative arab neighbors to do likewise 
under pressure of the 198088 iraniraq war oman and the united 
arab emirates established ties with the soviet union as well as 
with china and the east european bloc nations in the early 1980s 
qatar followed in the late 1980s 
under pressure of the gulf crisis saudi arabia finally dropped 
its resistance and announced the establishment of ties on sept 17 
and bahrain followed on sept 28

the united states and pakistan are 
trying quiet diplomacy this week to restart a halfbilliondollar 
aid package and redefine a 40yearold relationship erected on cold 
war foundations 
as the vitriolic antiamerica slogans of past weeks begin to 
fade washington and islamabad are searching for ways to break the 
impasse over pakistans nuclear program the biggest source of 
friction between the two longtime allies 
on oct 1 president bush said he could not guarantee congress 
that pakistan does not possess nor wants to possess nuclear 
weapons automatically freezing economic and military assistance 
pakistan one of washingtons best friends in the islamic world 
reacted strongly to the suspension partly blamed on the 
proamerican policies of prime minister benazir bhutto before 
her aug 6 ouster on corruption charges 
teresita schaffer a deputy assistant secretary of state 
arrives thursday for talks with prime minister nawaz sharifs 
monthold government on a wide range of issues including the 
impasse on the nuclear program 
henry rowen an assistant secretary of defense is expected next 
week 
us officials say the problems are not insurmountable but they 
acknowledge that neither side has much room to maneuver 
few people expect islamabad to back down on its nuclear program 
and congress appears in no mood to make concessions a stalemate 
that some western diplomats fear could reshape alliances in the 
region by pushing pakistan closer to its western neighbor iran 
many anaylsts and diplomats believe the cutoff of us aid and 
washingtons ultimatum would leave pakistan with no option but to 
accelerate its nuclear program declare itself a nuclear state and 
test an atomic device 
neither pakistani nor american officials are willing to be 
specific about what islamabad allegedly did that prompted the aid 
suspension but diplomatic sources say president ghulam ishaq khan 
ms bhutto and topranking military leaders decided last spring to 
cross the nuclear threshold 
with the threat looming of a fourth war with its traditionally 
antagonistic eastern neighbor india they agreed to step up 
pakistans secret program to enrich uranium for possible use in 
nuclear weapons 
islamabad insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes 
and accuses washington of turning a blind eye to the nuclear 
programs of other countries including israel south africa and 
more importantly india which tested a nuclear device in 1974 
a nuclearcapable india breathing down the neck of pakistan 
hardly makes an easy equation said retired brig gen ar 
siddiqi the resulting strategic imbalance could throw south asia 
into a situation where the quest for security takes precedence over 
the quest for abiding peace and reconciliation 
pakistan is the thirdlargest recipient of us aid after egypt 
and israel the beneficiary of a sixyear 4 billion package that 
includes delivery of 50 f16 jet fighters the pride and backbone 
of its air force 
when the deal was signed in 1987 western diplomats said the 
united states agreed to provide pakistan with a sophisticated 
conventional defense force the only hitch pakistan would not go 
nuclear 
that was the deal they accepted it then said one diplomat 
insisting on anonymity but they are a sovereign state they can 
unaccept it now 
sharif says he wants to maintain good relations with washington 
but not at the cost of pakistans sovereignty and independence 
pakistan he says is prepared to live with the consequences 
but many pakistanis say their country has become an addict of 
foreign aid receiving an estimated 3 billion annually and has 
been living beyond its means for a long time 
the suspension of us aid comes at a time when the persian gulf 
crisis is taking its toll on pakistans economy already burdened 
by a 155 billion foreign debt oil prices have skyrocketed more 
than 40 percent remittances from the gulf have plummeted and 
export earnings have dropped 
relations between the united states and pakistan have followed 
an onagain offagain course since 1976 when islamabad first 
endured washingtons wrath by signing a nuclear reprocessing plant 
deal with france the project was canceled in 1977 and aid resumed 
the following year 
washington again cut assistance in 1979 after disclosures that 
pakistan was importing sensitive materials to its nuclear facility 
outside islamabad 
aid was restarted later that year after the soviet union sent 
its troops into neighboring afghanistan and restored uspakistan 
relations to the cozy days of the 1950s containment of the 
communist threat 
with the end to the cold war and the soviet withdrawal from 
afghanistan western diplomats say pakistan no longer has the 
strategic importance it enjoyed during the afghan war 
after iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 many pakistanis 
believed the persian gulf would be their afghanistan of the 1990s 
and ease us pressure instead the gulf crisis has heightened the 
pressure 
an increasingly assertive congress feels that the us 
administration ignored the wrong signals from iraq to serve 
shortterm strategic goals and nurtured the fiend that devoured 
kuwait said one military source also insisting on anonymity 
fear of the islamic bomb still looms large in the american 
psyche he said

combat troops once at the front 
line of the us defense against the soviets in europe poured into 
saudi arabia on wednesday the vanguard of the us buildup in the 
gulf 
sixteen hours after leaving snowcovered germany soldiers from 
the 2nd armored cavalry regiment were sweating in temperatures in 
the high 70s and getting accustomed to walking in ankledeep sand 
at an air base in eastern saudi arabia 
this is one of the best trained units in the army said lt 
andy kilgore 23 of philadelphia miss from the regiments 2nd 
squadron theyve been trained to face 7to1 odds against the 
soviets theyre ready for the iraqis or anybody else 
the arriving soldiers some looking tense and nervous said they 
were welltrained for war but hoping for peace 
lt gene lanzillo 25 of alexandria va said the unit used to 
patrol the former east german border and had been on the cutting 
edge of eastwest divisions never envisioning ending up in saudi 
arabia 
there was at least one similarity he said the iraqis use 
mainly soviet equipment 
i think theyre a competent army a battletested army after 
eight years of fighting iran were not leary of them but i think 
we respect the power they represent lanzillo said 
certainly wed like it to be settled peacefully he added 
i think we have more to lose if it isnt 
the regiment is one of eight army units ordered here as part of 
the 200000strong troop buildup that will give the 240000 us 
troops already in the gulf the capability to launch a military 
operation to liberate kuwait 
advance teams from other us and germanbased units have been 
arriving here the past week but the 2nd armored cavalry which is 
part of the armys vii corps is the first major combat force to 
reinforce operation desert shield 
brig gen steven l arnold assistant chief of staff of the 
us armed forces central command said combat support units had 
arrived first unlike the initial us deployment in early august 
when combat troops were first on the ground 
its not the same situation that it was in august he said 
in an interview in august when the 82nd airborne landed here 
they fully expected to fight that day 
with a lot of combat troops already here the army is now 
returning to its normal practice of bringing in support teams first 
so that when combat troops arrive there is already someone on the 
ground to take care of their food living quarters and 
transportation arnold said 
he said the main armored and mechanized units are now on their 
way we have some afloat coming from europe some moving from the 
states and theyll be arriving soon he said 
all reinforcements are expected to be here by jan 15 the 
deadline the united nations has set for saddam hussein to withdraw 
from kuwait before facing possible military action by the 
multinational force it includes about 100000 ground troops from 
15 other countries 
some air force reinforcements also flew in on wednesday 
several f15 fighter pilots from the 1st tactical fighter wing 
at langley air force base va landed at the airbase a team of 
civil engineers from tyndall air force base fla who do rapid 
runway repairs were shuttling between two airbases because of a 
mixup in their final destination several truck drivers from the 
air forces 66th transportation company at semback air force base 
in germany didnt know where they were heading 
gen arnold said the ideal is to give newly arriving troops 
at least three weeks to get used to the climate and the 
environment to make sure all their equipment has arrived and been 
checked out and to travel the several hundred miles to their 
desert camps

a short crop has forced up the price of peanut 
butter so the agriculture department instead will donate more 
cheese to schools and needy people officials said wednesday 
betty jo nelsen administrator of the departments food and 
nutrition service said process cheese prices have dropped to an 
average of 120 per pound from about 165 a year ago 
meanwhile droughtreduced peanut yields this year boosted 
peanut butter prices to around 170 per pound from less than 1 a 
year ago she said 
cheese was in plentiful supply in the early 1980s as result of 
large dairy surpluses and was a big item on the usdas food 
donation list but as these surpluses dwindled prices rose and 
little cheese was available for donations 
cheese is an excellent source of protein and calcium and we 
know our clients will be glad to see it back in our programs 
again nelsen said 
the cheese will be substituted for peanut butter on a limited 
basis in the child nutrition programs including school lunches 
and the program for the elderly beginning in december she said 
in february about 40 million pounds of cheese will replace 
peanut butter in the temporary emergency assistance program which 
provides food aid to the needy including lowincome and unemployed 
people nelsen said

a former panamanian lieutenant colonel prosecutors 
say can tie manuel noriega directly to drug payoffs signed a 
longdelayed plea bargain wednesday his attorney said 
luis del cid agreed in march to plead guilty to some 
drugrelated charges but the deal bogged down over guarantees he 
would not be extradited to panama for prosecution there after 
serving his us term 
the department of justice has now agreed to oppose deporting or 
extraditing del cid said his attorney sam burstyn 
fortunately the us government has agreed to all the points 
now burstyn said 
the agreement was signed late wednesday and was to be the 
subject of a hearing thursday before us district judge william 
hoeveler 
burstyn said recent court battles over noriegas taped telephone 
conversations and the freezing of his assets boosted del cids 
bargaining power 
i figured we had reached a sellers market in light of the 
governments recent difficulties burstyn said 
diane cossin spokeswoman for the us attorneys office said 
she could not discuss negotiations with defendants attorneys 
del cid was a lieutenant colonel in the panamanian military and 
a top aide to noriega when the two were captured during the us 
invasion 
del cid acted as a liaison and money courier between drug 
traffickers and manuel antonio noriega the us attorneys 
office has said 
the plea agreement calls for del cid to provide testimony 
against noriega burstyn said del cid faced a maximum of 70 years 
on four drug counts but agreed to plead guilty to only one with a 
maximum recommended sentence of 10 years burstyn said he expected 
del cid to serve only about 2 years 
noriegas defense professes iittle concern about del cids 
possible testimony 
hes just another witness who is getting paid for his 
testimony said noriega attorney jon may del cid is just one 
among many witnesses who are getting the keys to the jailhouse door 
from a government thats desperate to shore up its case 
del cids plea bargain will not hurt noriega as long as del 
cid tells the truth said a lead noriega lawyer frank rubino 
del cid is accused in a february 1988 indictment of accepting 
200000 in cocainetrafficking profits from drug pilot floyd 
carlton caceres now the prosecutions chief witness carlton and 
noriega had agreed to the price during a december 1983 meeting the 
indictment alleges 
later that month carlton delivered the money intended for 
noriega to del cid at the headquarters of the panamanian defense 
forces in panama city the pilot continued to deal with noriega and 
prosecutors have said that shows the money was indeed passed on to 
the panamanian leader 
the defense has previously disputed some prosecution claims that 
del cid was a key aide to noriega forcing the us attorneys 
office to acknowledge he was not head of panamanian intelligence 
as they first claimed 
but prosecutors in turn showed a picture of del cid and noriega 
at a meeting with cuban leader fidel castro a meeting the 
indictment says was intended to mediate a dispute between noriega 
and the medellin drug cartel which allegedly paid noriega 46 
million and bribes to ship cocaine through panama

the united states embraced canadas findings 
about a 1985 air crash in gander newfoundland without consulting 
the chief us investigator who looked into the disaster a 
congressional panel was told wednesday 
george seidlein the national transportation safety boards 
chief onsite investigator in gander testified that canadian 
investigators were wrong in concluding that ice on the wings caused 
the disaster that killed a planeload of american servicemen 
seidleins superiors at the ntsb endorsed the iceonthewings 
theory but didnt ask seidlein for his opinion even though they 
sent him up to gander to look into the crash which killed 256 
americans 
seidlein said the weather conditions simply werent right for 
ice to have formed on the wings in sufficient amounts to cause the 
crash he wasnt invited to give his views and didnt volunteer 
them he told the house judiciary subcommittee on crime 
instead he said the crash occurred because the crew tried to 
force the dc8 to climb after takeoff before it had accelerated to 
a high enough speed 
seidlein rejects the theory that a terrorist bomb might have 
downed the plane a possibility that has been raised by some 
canadian investigators members of congress and families of the 
victims 
several eyewitnesses say they saw a bright flame just before the 
crash a terrorist group with ties to iran claimed responsibility 
for the disaster which occurred amid the reagan administrations 
secret arms sales to iran 
rep william hughes dnj asked seidleins boss ronald 
schleede why the chief investigator wasnt questioned 
seidlein wasnt intentionally excluded from consultations 
replied schleede the ntsbs investigations chief 
by the time canada reached its conclusions seidlein had 
transferred to an agency office in lansing mich and was about to 
retire schleede testified 
hughes the panel chairman accused schleede of trying to give 
us a snow job 
why did you send him up there to gander hughes asked 
schleede is there a reason you didnt bring him in 
no sir schleede responded 
rep william mccollum rfla suggested that the united states 
was loathe to question canada too closely about its probe of the 
crash 
just because the two countries have close ties thats no reason 
we ought to have blinders on said mccollum 
we had access to all the relevant data and found no 
problems with the canadians findings said schleede who still 
regards the iceonthewings theory as plausible 
seidlein said it was his choice to go to lansing and that he was 
under no pressure from the ntsb but he also said he had been asked 
for input on other international crashes before the us decided 
whether to endorse the findings 
hughes disclosed that the subcommittee has been pressing canada 
to provide investigative reports by the royal canadian mounted 
police the rcmp looked into the possibility of a terrorist link in 
the gander crash hughes said he will urge the 102nd congress to 
pursue the matter and that the fbi and intelligence agencies should 
review the reports once the us government obtains them

game was key in the redskins 4220 rout of miami 
its a nice honor i dont know what the criteria are but 
its nice to have it it means a lot as an honor to the total 
offensive line said lachey 
a sixthyear player lachey was obtained from the los angeles 
raiders in 1987 for quarterback jay schroeder who now starts for 
the raiders redskins officials however consider the deal one of 
their best in recent years and have long called lachey the most 
talented member of their line 
i think it says a lot for him and the other linemen coach 
joe gibbs said of the award i think it says a lot for our 
coaches and linemen theyre a tightknit group theyve bounced 
back and taken some criticism 
gibbs said coaches who grade game films said the redskins 
blocking against miami was their best of the season 
meanwhile gibbs brushed aside comments that were reportedly 
made by former redskin quarterback joe theismann critical of his 
coaching methods and assistants 
the national sports daily quoted theismann wednesday as saying 
gibbs had gotten rid of the teams characters and was becoming 
so isolated that he was out of touch with his players 
joe hasnt been around much lately so he needs to stop by i 
dont know where all that came from gibbs said 
from the sounds of it im not sure joe knows what hes talking 
about he said 
the interview with theismann who was the redskins quarterback 
in their 1982 super bowl championship season was included in the 
newspapers first edition to be sold in the washington area

rep bob carr suggested yanking the authority 
of house chairmen to approve overseas junkets for their committees 
but that suggestion died before the day was over 
i offered it only yesterday and didnt have the opportunity to 
mount the campaign you need to make these kinds of things happen 
he said wednesday i didnt want to embarrass anyone by springing 
a surprise 
carr dmich said he made his point just by floating his 
proposed house rule under which recorded committee votes would be 
required for all committeesponsored foreign travel he withdrew 
the proposal the same day he proposed it 
house democrats discussed the matter at length in a closeddoor 
caucus tuesday carr said and he said rules committee chairman joe 
moakley dmass and rep martin frost dtexas chairman of the 
caucus panel on organization promised to study possible changes in 
travel policy 
my intention at this point was to put people on notice to 
take a shot across the bow on congressional travel carr said 
that may be enough to solve the problem if theres a spate of 
goofy thinlysubstantiated travel in the future ill press this 
in a most forceful way 
carr elected last month to his ninth term sought similar 
reforms in the 1970s without success 
he said he decided to renew his effort after seeing a television 
news report on a trip to latin america by eight members of the 
house ways and means committee last april the group spent the last 
five days of the 12day excursion which cost about 100000 on 
the caribbean island of barbados 
an abc news crew using handheld cameras videotaped members of 
the delegation there the report aired in october on the program 
primetime live said the barbados segment of the trip consisted 
largely of leisure activities 
several lawmakers who made the trip said the presentation was 
inaccurate and that they put in long hours of work carr said he 
couldnt pass judgment on the entire ways and means trip but that 
the barbados portion was suspect 
publicity about such questionable activity threatens to 
undermine public confidence in all congressional travel most of 
which is justified and can save money by giving lawmakers ideas for 
changing programs he said 
despite their power committee chairmen can be overruled by a 
majority of the members on most matters under house rules carr 
said but he said there is no provision limiting chairmens power 
to authorize travel 
under his proposed rule all committeesponsored foreign trips 
would be authorized by a resolution approved by majority vote the 
resolution would include a detailed itinerary the purpose for each 
stop the name of everyone making the trip the estimated total 
expense and the trips anticipated benefit to taxpayers

the chairman of the house judiciary committee 
accused the justice department on wednesday of engaging in a 
coverup by withholding documents about its dealings with a computer 
firm 
rep jack brooks dtexas said the committee cannot complete 
its investigation of the justice departments alleged mistreatment 
of inslaw inc because the agency refuses to turn over some 200 
documents it considers privileged 
brooks indicated the committee would conduct further discussions 
to determine if it should subpoena the documents 
steven r ross the general counsel for the house charged that 
in refusing to turn over the documents attorney general dick 
thornburgh was trying to exempt his department from congressional 
investigations of waste fraud and abuse 
the justice department has been locked in a lengthy court battle 
with inslaw inc a computer software firm that alleges that 
government officials conspired to steal its product and drive it 
out of business 
the department is appealing a bankruptcy courts finding 
confirmed by a federal district judge that officials used 
trickery fraud and deceit to steal software that inslaw had 
devised for us attorneys offices 
the companys president william hamilton estimated that the 
justice departments actions cost inslaw several hundred million 
dollars in lost business 
the judiciary committee is investigating inslaws allegations 
that top justice department officials under former attorney general 
edwin meese iii engaged in a criminal conspiracy to drive the 
company out of business and deliver lucrative government computer 
contracts to political friends of the reagan administration the 
justice department denies those allegations 
brooks said the justice departments refusal to turn over 200 
documents the agency considers privileged has stalled the 
investigation 
in a sept 26 letter to the committee thornburgh told the panel 
he could not turn over the material because of an obligation to 
protect documents compiled by attorneys in connection with 
pending litigation which are not in the public domain and could be 
described as litigation strategy or work product 
that could be described as coverup or hiding or holding out 
brooks said at a hearing of the panels economic and commercial law 
subcommittee to discuss what steps to take to force production of 
the documents 
ross noted that in an aug 21 letter thornburgh urged the 
committee to review justice department documents on the inslaw 
matter before launching an investigation into unsubstantiated 
innuendo 
on the one hand the attorney general invited the committee to 
review the documents and then when the committee asks to see the 
very same documents he has switched positions and now is saying 
those documents are privileged ross said 
ross said the justice department made a more direct attack on 
congresss power to investigate waste and fraud in the government 
in a dec 4 letter to the panels ranking republican member rep 
hamilton fish of new york 
the letter by w lee rawls assistant attorney general for 
legislative affairs states that congressional investigations are 
justifiable only as a means of facilitating the task of passing 
legislation 
ross said the justice department is trying to create a new 
standard for what is acceptable means of committee investigation 
what that proposed standard would do would be to eradicate the 
timehonored role of congress of providing oversight which is a 
means that has been upheld by the supreme court by which the 
congress can assure itself that previously passed laws have been 
properly implemented

wednesday in a raucous confrontation outside a courtroom where a 
judge set 300000 bail for the man charged with the murder of 
rabbi meir kahane 
no bail for murderers yelled the jews and the arabs 
shouted god is great thanks be to god as they met in a 
hallway of the manhattan criminal courts building 
armed court officers wedged themselves between the groups and 
forced the arabs to leave the building by one set of elevators 
while directing the jews to another 
outside both groups marched and chanted the jewish group 
carried an effigy intended to represent the suspect with a noose 
around the neck and a mockup of an electric chair 
the bail hearing was for el sayyid nosair 35 of cliffside 
nj who allegedly shot kahane to death nov 5 as the rabbi 
finished speaking to a jewish group at a midtown manhattan hotel 
we will raise the bail as quickly as we can said nosairs 
lawyer michael warren he was accompanied by an egyptian lawyer 
dr abdel halim mandour who said he was here to help with the 
case nosair came to this country from egypt in 1981 
nosair is also accused of wounding two other men and threatening 
a third while fleeing he was stopped when a us postal service 
police officer shot him in the neck a block from the hotel 
warren asked a judge alvin schlesinger to set bail at 
100000 saying nosair had never been arrested before has a wife 
and child and other relatives here and was a responsible city 
employee nosair a universitytrained engineer worked as a boiler 
tender 
assistant district attorney william greenbaum opposed bail 
telling schlesinger that the prosecution has witnesses the murderweapon 
and ballistics evidence to tie nosair to the crimes 
greenbaum said nosair did have an arrest record a rape charge 
in pennsylvania in 1985 that was dropped 
schlesinger set bail and said he would issue his rulings on 
motions march 4 
during the hearing a man who shouted god will punish you 
nosair was ushered out of the courtroom and a woman who 
complained that the bail was too low was restrained briefly by 
court officers

an experimental antirejection drug has 
reversed the effects of some autoimmune diseases and will be 
tested on people suffering from the most serious form of diabetes 
a transplant surgeon said wednesday 
the food and drug administration approved a university of 
pittsburgh study in which the type i diabetes patients will be 
given the drug fk506 about a week after diagnoses dr thomas 
starzl said 
we are anxious to get the information out that there is 
something that could switch off this disease starzl told 
reporters whether you believe its proper or not its only here 
that teens or adults can be treated providing we can see them 
early 
several type i diabetes studies are under way on weaker 
immunesuppressing drugs but fk506 has shown the most potential 
for curbing the illness said gerod grodsky a biochemistry 
professor and diabetes researcher at the university of san 
francisco 
i think this is an experiment that has to be done grodsky 
said the potential advantages are enormous 
type i diabetes also known as juvenile diabetes affects 11 to 
12 million americans of all ages it can cause blindness and kidney 
failure and its symptoms are excessive thirst frequent urination 
rapid weight loss and blurred vision 
only university of pittsburgh hospitals have been given fda 
approval to use fk506 which fujisawa pharmaceutical co of japan 
derives from a fungus the drug fights rejection of organ 
transplants by suppressing white blood cells which stave off 
infection and disease 
the university already has tested the drug on two autoimmune 
diseases in such diseases the bodys white cells mistakenly 
destroy healthy cells 
fk506 reversed the effects of psoriasis a skin disease that 
creates unsightly skin lesions in all six patients who took the 
drug starzl said the drug also reversed the effects of pyoderma 
a rare skin ulcer in six of seven patients he said 
were seeing some very dramatic recoveries he said 
also fk506 appeared to cure a disease similar to type i 
diabetes in laboratory rats said dr patricia carroll of 
pittburghs medical school 
starzl said researchers hope to test fk506 on a dizzying list 
of diseases including multiple sclerosis and a form of 
hepatitis 
starzl who in 1963 performed the worlds first successful human 
liver transplant is credited with making the university a world 
transplant center 
at the news conference starzl 64 also said he would perform 
fewer surgeries and more research at the universitys planned 
transplant institute 
the university has started a nationwide search for 60 type i 
diabetes patients ages 18 to 45 for the twoyear study half will 
receive insulin and fk506 half will receive insulin and placebos 
carroll said 
patients with type i diabetes need insulin shots to survive 
because the white cells destroy the bodys insulin factories in the 
pancreas 
complicating the study is the type i diabetes socalled 
honeymoon period up to a year of remission after diagnosis in 
about half the patients carroll said it will be difficult to 
determine if improvements in patients conditions are due to the 
remissions or the drug she said 
grodsky said he was concerned about fk506s side effects on the 
diabetes patients but carroll said researchers have yet to see the 
drugs side effects in patients who havent undergone transplants 
in transplant patients fk506 has caused dizziness and 
excessive dreaming she said 
while the type i study is very exciting whether this drug is 
the one that works or not we dont know yet grodsky said

a former state legislator received three 
years probation and a 2500 fine wednesday on a cocaine possession 
charge stemming from an fbi investigation of statehouse corruption 
i feel there is nothing more i can say except that i am 
terribly sorry the former house member donna moss told us 
district judge falcon hawkins 
mrs moss a gaffney democrat and the mother of two is the 
third former lawmaker sentenced in the probe 
under sentencing guidelines mrs moss could have received up to 
four months in jail she pleaded guilty oct 12 to the single 
misdemeanor count as part of a plea bargain she agreed to 
cooperate with the government 
mrs moss admitted involvement with drugs on or about april 19 
1989 
her attorney wade weatherford told hawkins mrs moss became 
associated with people she thought were her friends 
weatherford arguing his client should not go to jail said 
after she broke company with those people she never used drugs 
again 
she has readily admitted her guilt and cooperated fully 
weatherford said she has never received financial gain for 
anything she has done 
he said it is impossible to express her feelings of having 
hurt people she has lost a promising political career but that is 
probably the least of her loss and hurt 
mrs moss needs to be home for her two children ages 10 and 15 
weatherford said 
hawkins said he was confident mrs moss has suffered for the 
pain and suffering brought on her family and the humiliation 
you have brought on your fellowmembers of the legislature 
as terms of probation mrs moss must if asked submit to 
random drug testing she must cooperate with authorities and pay 
9666 a month for probation costs in addition she must pay a 25 
special assessment 
us attorney bart daniel said mrs moss began cooperating with 
authorities literally within hours of being contacted by the 
fbi 
the extent of the cooperation was briefly discussed during a 
hearing at the judges bench the record of the hearing was ordered 
sealed by hawkins 
monday former state sen rick lee got six months at a halfway 
house and five years probation former rep luther taylor got a 
6year prison term

carolina

in october convicted him on six counts of violating federal bribery 
laws

activities but information uncovered during the fbis operation 
lost trust led to the drug charge 
three former house members who pleaded guilty to bribery charges 
await sentencing four other house members await trial 
mrs moss was elected to the house in 1984 and rose to head of 
the medical military public and municipal affairs committee she

us and philippine panels began 
talks wednesday on the future of us military bases in the 
philippines and a us spokesman said later both sides expected to 
reach agreement by next month 
the americans maintain the giant clark air base subic bay naval 
base and four smaller facilities under a treaty that expires in 
september 1991 
stanley schrager spokesman for the us side told a briefing 
after wednesdays meeting that both panels are optimistic they can 
agree by the end of january their selfimposed deadline 
on tuesday before talks began the philippines spokesma said 
disagreements had surfaced on operation of the bases 
schrager said wednesday obviously the talks have not broken 
down there has not been an impasse 
philippine spokesman rafael alunan said technical committees of 
the two negotating teams had difficulties agreeing how much 
freedom will be allowed us forces inside clark after the 
philippines assumes sovereign control over the base 
alunan said wednesdays talks provided a clearer 
understanding of each others position but no agreements were 
reached talks will resume thursday 
schrager said any disagreements by the experts will have to be 
resolved later by philippine foreign secretary raul manglapus and 
chief us negotiator richard armitage 
our hope is by the time mr armitage leaves on friday we 
would come closer to resolving some of the stickier issues and 
mapping out an initial framework for a continued security 
relationship schrager said 
the third round of bases talks opened in the heavily guarded 
central bank building manglapus and armitage met privately 
tuesday 
manglapus has announced the philippines will take over clark and 
the four small bases after 1991 but allow us forces access on a 
commercial basis he said manila was open to extending the us 
stay at subic for a 5to7year period 
americans would have access to standing structures at clark 
but the philippines will control thoroughfares runways and air 
traffic control alunan said 
he said filipino officials encountered stiff resistance from 
the american side when they insisted on applying philippine laws on 
tariffs income taxes duties licenses and registration inside 
clark 
an official close to the talks who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the philippines demanded total criminal 
jurisdiction over us service members takeover of postal service 
and use of the philippine peso as currency in the base 
a lot of this is totally unacceptable to the americans 
the official said this has to be straightened out at a higher 
level 
exact amount of compensation for us use of the bases will be 
determined later 
in 1988 the reagan administration agreed to seek 960 million 
in us aid over two years for use of the bases through 1991 
last year congress cut the bush administrations aid request 
for the philippines provoking charges that the united states 
reneged on its pledge

serbian president slobodan milosevic 
on wednesday urged yugoslavs to learn from their history and avoid 
fratricidal violence ahead of elections pitting his socialist party 
against nationalist parties 
there is no time or reason to give our lives again in the 
struggle over the countrys fate said milosevic whose party of 
hardline communists recently changed its name to the socialist 
party 
the state tanjug news agency reporting his comments said he 
spoke to about 70000 supporters in novi sad 40 miles northwest of 
belgrade 
serbia the largest of six yugoslav republics and montenegro 
are the last of yugoslavias six republics to be ruled by 
communists giving sundays elections special significance 
with ethnic and political tensions rife the central 
intelligence agency has predicted the country may break up in 18 
months and civil war could break out 
many of the 17 million victims of world war ii were yugoslavs 
killed by other yugoslavs and with the death of communist founder 
josip broz tito in 1980 traditional regional rivalries have 
rekindled 
serbias differences with ethnic albanians in its province of 
kosovo have resulted in bloodshed several times the past year 
serbia also is feuding with croatia and slovenia the most liberal 
yugoslav republics over the future of the country 
milosevic would prefer a strong federation where serbia can 
maintain its dominance but croatias and slovenias newly 
established democratic governments have served notice they could 
seek independence unless the country was changed into a loose 
confederation with greater autonomy

the keating five senators pressured thrift 
regulators on behalf of probably the worst institution in 
america and caused enforcement delays that inflated the cost of 
the eventual federal bailout the senate ethics committee was told 
wednesday 
william k blacks criticism was the strongest the committee has 
heard of the senators intervention with thrift regulators black 
a senior career regulator was the first witness in 12 days of 
hearings to blame the senators for delays in the governments 
seizing of charles h keating jrs lincoln savings and loan 
at the conclusion of wednesdays session committee chairman 
howell heflin dala announced the panel has voted to compel the 
testimony of a key aide to keating james grogan 
the regulators testimony had defense lawyers for the senators 
bitterly objecting that black should not be permitted to blame the 
delay on senators because he had no direct knowledge they were 
responsible he was permitted to give the testimony 
black said political pressure by all the senators generally 
played a role in delaying the seizure from 1987 to april 1989 it 
may now cost taxpayers more than 2 billion to cover the losses of 
the irvine calif thrift 
the regulator specifically linked pressure from an aide to sen 
alan cranston dcalif in may 1988 to delaying decisions by 
regulators that greatly increased losses for taxpayers 
at an april 9 1987 meeting between the five senators and four 
regulators including himself black testified that sen dennis 
deconcini dariz kept coming at us on lincolns behalf even 
after the regulators said they were making criminal referrals to 
the justice department 
cranstons lawyer william taylor iii called blacks testimony 
the most fundamental smear james hamilton representing 
deconcini said black was having people smeared having innuendo 
left and was reckless and irresponsible 
the other three senators under investigation are john mccain 
rariz donald w riegle jr dmich and john glenn dohio 
keating and his associates contributed 13 million to the five 
senators campaigns and causes the committee is trying to 
determine whether the money influenced their conduct 
earlier two former chief thrift regulators edwin j gray and 
m danny wall told the committee the senators were not responsible 
for delaying the seizure of keatings irvine calif thrift until 
april 14 1989 
that was two years after the san franciscobased regulators who 
met with the senators in 1987 had recommended a government 
takeover 
black provided a vivid account of the april 9 1987 meeting with 
the senators saying he was extremely upset with their hostile tone 
toward the regulators 
this is an institution that probably was the worst institution 
in america and instead of people trying to help bring it under 
control five us senators were pushing us in the opposite 
direction it was startlingly the wrong direction black 
testified 
they had made a decision we were wrong lincoln was an abused 
institution and they were coming after us we were put under 
considerable pressure immediately you could see it in our faces 
five us senators are a heck of a lot bigger than this boy i 
felt charles keating had clearly set up the session to be 
intimidating 
black also said he became aware that keating was trying to have 
him fired committee counsel robert bennett released a july 15 
1987 memo from keating to his lobbyist in which keating wrote 
highest priority get black good grief if you cant get 
wright and congress to get black kill him dead you ought to 
retire 
wright is a reference to former house speaker jim wright who 
met on at least one occasion with keating 
but the testimony that most riled defense lawyers came when 
bennett asked black 
in the twoyear period where the bank board did not take 
action did the inquiry by the senators have an effect on board 
decisions 
yes black responded and repeated the answer when the 
committee chairman sen howell heflin dala asked whether 
political influence of these senators interfered with or affected 
the treatment of lincoln 
black testified the federal home loan bank board backed off its 
tough position on lincoln in may 1988 
he testified that after the board approved a hardline policy on 
may 5 of that year a cranston aide carolyn jordan called two 
senior officers at the bank board and indicated severe 
displeasure 
the board revised its policy black said to expressly permit 
lincoln to make new direct investments they would not otherwise be 
allowed to make 
lincoln also was permitted to significantly expand its sale of 
junk bonds 
this led to greatly increased losses for the federal savings 
and loan insurance fund initially and the taxpayers eventually 
black said 
under crossexamination from mccain attorney john dowd black 
was asked whether the arizona republican had done anything to 
interfere with your examination of lincoln 
not to my knowledge black replied 
and under questioning from glenn lawyer carol e bruce black 
acknowledged that the senator could not have known before 
meeting with regulators how bad the problems were 
heflin said the committee on thursday would seek an order in 
us district court granting limited immunity from prosecution for 
grogans testimony grogan was corporate counsel for keatings main 
company american continental corp and vice president of lincoln 
grogan keating and five other witnesses have refused to testify 
on the grounds that the fifth amendment to the constitution permits 
them to decline to testify in a manner that might incriminate them 
heflin said no immunity order would be sought for keating 
in explaining the decision heflin said grogran had 
substantial contacts with all five senators and the committee 
believes it cannot fulfill its obligation to these members and the 
senate without obtaining his testimony 
the chairman added that giving use immunity to mr grogan does 
not bar the prosecution of any person including mr grogan 
under a grant of use immunity prosecutors may not use 
testimony of the witness in question in any way but are not barred 
from a prosecutionif they can show their evidence was obtained 
independently 
no date for grogans appearance has been set but heflin said he 
would not testify before dec 12

miamis police chief who has weathered more than 
20 riots during 22 years on the force said wednesday that 
criticism over slow police reaction to a melee this week is 
overblown and unwarranted 
police had no idea violence would escalate in a largely puerto 
rican neighborhood and they had to stay on side streets until 
reinforcements arrived said perry anderson who has headed the 
department of 1114 officers for 2 years 
anderson said the monday incident in which hundreds of youths 
swarmed through the citys impoverished wynwood neighborhood 
looting stores and setting fires was minor compared to what hes 
been through in the past 
this was not a riot this was not even an uprising the 
46yearold anderson said in an interview everybodys crying 
foul you see it all over the news and it looks like miamis 
burning down but miamis not on fire you have to look at the 
magnitude of what actually happened here 
two large businesses a vacant crack house and four vehicles 
were destroyed by fire causing an estimated 3 million damage a 
dozen small businesses were hit by looters anderson said there 
have been 11 arrests stemming from the disturbance so far 
were not being given credit that we did not lose any lives 
said anderson who recalled a 1980 riot that left 18 people dead 
after an allwhite jury acquitted five police officers in the 
beating death of a black motorcyclist 
mondays incident was sparked by the partial acquittal of six 
officers accused of beating to death a smalltime puerto rican drug 
dealer from the neighborhood 
the unrest began about 7 pm and raged unchecked until 150 
officers in full riot gear moved in about 930 pm 
until police could get back up help they did the best they 
could to keep people from entering the 10block area anderson 
said the police also kept close guard on surrounding districts 
where thousands of employees work in the citys garment industry 
but that didnt make business and community leaders feel better 
in wynwood considered one of the poorest neighborhoods in miami 
with an annual median income of 10900 
the worst thing was that the cops were there and they 
didnt do anything said manny frias whose television store was 
cleaned out by looters 
it was just the most helpless thing ive experienced in my 
life said sara seidler whose drapery store burned to the 
ground why didnt the police go in how come there were media in 
here and there were no police 
patrick gerrits whose 44yearold construction company was 
gutted said he got calls from officers as early as 4 pm warning 
him to clear out 
anderson said he is infuriated that officers made such calls to 
businesses but didnt notify their superiors of a possible 
disturbance 
none of those people informed the chief of police he said 
critics say the police should not have been caught off guard as 
anderson and mayor xavier suarez have admitted given the citys 
penchant for unrest after a racially charged trial involving 
police 
anderson who said he was criticized this summer for moving in 
too quickly during a haitian demonstration complained now im 
being criticized because i didnt go in early enough youre damned 
if you do damned if you dont

out for boom microphones 
bush suggested the warning wednesday as he posed for pictures 
with menem in his private office at casa rosada the presidents 
palace reporters cameramen and photographers crowded into the 
room and someone extended a longpoled boom microphone in the 
presidents direction 
i got myself in trouble with an open mike bush said 
motioning at the offending instrument and mentioning an 
embarrassing incident during his 1984 vice presidential campaign 
against geraldine ferraro 
bush was referring to his comments to longshoremen on the 
morning after his one debate with mrs ferraro he was speaking 
just to the group but a highly sensitive mike over his head picked 
what he said we tried to kick a little ass last night bush 
said then the comments haunted him for the remainder of the 
campaign 
if there was any further discussion of the incident between bush 
and menem it went unrecorded even on the boom mikes 
equals 
bushs annual quailhunting trip in beeville texas after 
christmas has fallen victim to the persian gulf crisis 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the president 
would spend the holidays at camp david instead with everything 
thats going on he just thought that was best fitzwater said 
usually bush and his wife barbara spend christmas at camp 
david and then the president heads out two days later for several 
days of hunting at beeville followed by a trout fishing excursion 
in alabama on the way home 
equals 
words were shouted in anger and pushes and shoves were traded as 
a leftist legislator demanded the right to speak as bush waited to 
address a joint session of argentinas congress 
luis zamora a member of the movement toward socialism sought 
recognition so he could protest bushs visit however vice 
president eduardo dualde quickly advised zamora that he was out of 
order and could not be heard amid some scuffling zamora was 
removed from the room by several colleagues and a sergeant at arms 
i dont want to be part of this farce zamora said 
afterwards a cameraman said the incident escalated outside the 
chamber and that the pushing turned into an exchange of blows 
bush took it in stride 
lest you be embarrassed by the echo we heard at the opening of 
this ceremony dont worry about it the president told the 
lawmakers every once in a while you hear an echo from the 
declining past of marxism he said it was the price for 
democracy 
equals 
with his wife ailing at home from a sinus infection bush 
brought his daughter dorothy leblond to south america as his 
companion she also was his tennis partner 
they teamed up for a doubles match at menems house against the 
argentine president and claudia casa bianca a former argentine 
tennis pro then menem and bush teamed up against alberto kohan 
his health minister and jorge dante menems tennis instructor 
after trailing bush and menem rallied to win 54 
it was the second contest for bush and menem the two also had 
played together last year in costa rica amid ceremonies celebrating 
that countrys 100th anniversary of democratic rule

northwest airlines pilot bill lovelace had just 
begun to get his life in order after a divorce and business failure 
when he found himself on the wrong runway at detroits foggy metro 
airport 
the pilot in a runway crash that killed eight people was 
described by friends wednesday as a professionalcaliber magician 
and woodworker a man meticulous in everything he did 
i would never hesitate to fly with him said barbara 
giannini a neigbor 
investigators say lovelace was piloting a northwest dc9 that 
collided with one of the carriers boeing 727s on monday killing 
eight people on the dc9 and injuring 24 others no one aboard the 
727 was injured 
lovelace 52 whose own injuries were minor once was an 
instructor in flying dc9s and has flown commercial airliners since 
1966 northwest officials said 
after logging 20000 hours in commercial flight he took 
disability leave in february 1985 for kidney stone treatment 
mondays flight would have been his 13th since returning to work 
nov 25 following two weeks of ground training and 13 hours of 
simulator flying five of the dozen flights had been into or out of 
the detroit airport but mondays was his first without a monitor 
at his side northwest said 
three weeks before returning to active duty lovelace had been 
declared bankrupt under a petition he had filed in midjuly in 
federal bankruptcy court in phoenix court records show he cited 
debts of about 152000 against assets of 106000 and a monthly 
income of 4212 in pension and retirement benefits 
the airline has described his absence as a medical leave rather 
than retirement 
his bankruptcy laywer david engelman said part oflovelaces 
debt stemmed from an unsuccessful gift shop that he sold in 1989 
divorced and with two grown children lovelace had remarried in 
september he was certified as fit to fly oct 10 by the federal 
aviation administration 
flying was his no 1 love he talked about it often said 
judy wells a friend of 3 years 
no one answered the door at lovelaces phoenix residence 
wednesday where a neatly trimmed kumquat tree graces the front 
yard of the beige stucco onestory house with heavy brown 
shutters 
neighbors offered a positive portrait of the man 
an accomplished magician he performed as the great orsini 
complete with swirling black cape 
good enough to be professional said a friend jack wall 
hes just a good neighbor said ms judy wells who took 
over the gift shop hed started during his medical leave hed 
stop in and see how your day was going 
neighbor dave giannini a carpenter also knows him as very 
fussy meticulous very intelligent 
his house shop anything he did had to be just right 
said giannini who lives across the street from lovelace 
i dont honestly believe it was his negligence that led to 
the collision giannini said that guy was a straight guy 
even driving a vehicle he was really cautious 
brad zinn a friend who patronizes sun magic shop where great 
orsini posters are displayed said lovelace is a very detailed 
kind of guy 
everything was just so with bill and im sure he took that 
into the cockpit zinn said bill just wouldnt have wandered 
onto the runway without some good reason there must have been some 
miscommunication 
it was lovelaces interest in magic that led to his woodworking 
he would perform shows for schools and hospitals when he wasnt 
flying and because he needed props for such tricks as sawing a 
woman in half he said in a 1986 newspaper interview he decided to 
make his own 
that led to purchase of a table saw and other equipment and 
ultimately to the lathe on which he shapes bowls that have sold for 
300 to 750 he once said it took 40 to 50 hours to make one of 
them 
he also has produced chess sets and grandfather clocks

a woman who was severely braindamaged in a 
1983 traffic accident appears far happier with her lesbian lover 
than with anyone else several nurses testified wednesday during a 
guardianship hearing 
the hearing to determine the guardianship of sharon kowalski 
once pitted her parents against her lover but don and della 
kowalski say they no longer have the energy or the money to care 
for their disabled daughter 
that leaves only ms kowalskis lover karen thompson seeking 
guardianship 
kowalski relinquished guardianship of his daughter last year and 
she has been cared for since at a nursing home in suburban 
robbinsdakem pending ms thompsons petition 
maryanne connell a licensed practical nurse from trevilla 
nursing home testfied that ms thompson has been extremely 
concerned about ms kowalskis emotional and physical welfare 
when karen thompson isnt around she is withdrawn shell be 
real quiet ms connell said when karen is there shes always 
smiling she responds better she cooperates 
other nurses provided similar testimony which was scheduled to 
continue through friday when judge robert campbell could make a 
final ruling 
gay rights activists have rallied around ms thompson saying 
she is the most capable of caring for ms kowalski 33 who was 
paralyzed in an accident blamed on a drunken driver 
ms kowalski lost use of her limbs and cant speak but she can 
use the fingers on her right hand and communicates by typing 
shaking her head and using an alphabet board she taught physical 
education before the accident 
ms thompson a professor at st cloud state university has 
testified that she and ms kowalski lived together four years 
before the accident and considered themselves secretly married 
kowalski had earlier fought ms thompsons attempts to gain 
guardianship saying he thought she only wanted to make money on 
speeches and a book about his daughter neither he nor his wife 
attended wednesdays hearing

these are tough times for local and state officials confronted 
by falling revenues and widening budget gaps they are laying off 
workers trimming aid to the old and poor and limiting services 
from garbage collection to snowplowing 
it takes a lot of courage to be a local elected officials 
these days said douglas peterson senior policy analyst for the 
national league of cities theyre going to be making harder and 
harder choices 
at least 26 states face deficits or budget shortfalls this 
fiscal year several others will next year the prospects get worse 
as the economy continues to slide 
local officials are even harder pressed federal funds from 
earlier years have dried up and many states have cut local aid to 
balance their budgets 
were at the bone already and the marrow is just beginning to 
leak said dave fuller a commissioner in lewis and clark county 
mont where any more bad fiscal news will mean cuts in senior 
citizen programs snowplowing and road repair 
there are a few exceptions oil states such as alaska and 
louisiana see revenues grow along with oil prices wyoming is 
anticipating an unexpected 184 million in increased revenues next 
year 
but the bounty is doubleedged before his term as governor 
expired this week alaskas steve cowper asked for 43 million 
more to pay escalating costs for fueling state cars trucks and 
ferries 
elsewhere officials struggle to maintain the status quo as the 
situation grows more bleak 
were kind of like a boat in a swiftflowing stream and i am 
trying to keep that boat right where it is instead of being swept 
downstream in that current said govelect zell miller of 
georgia where dropping revenues threaten layoffs next year 
in most cases spending is being trimmed through acrosstheboard 
spending cuts 
it allows department heads to decide what their priorities 
are said said marsha howard research director for the national 
association of state budget directors the problem with 
acrosstheboard cuts is that you might end up with a small agency 
taking such a cut that it cant exist anymore 
however cuts are imposed they mean a reduction in what 
government can do 
new york gov mario cuomos proposed 1 billion spending cut 
would reduce state aid to education medicaid the homeless and 
those with aids 
if you dont like these cuts then show me what other cuts you 
have in mind cuomo said when his plan was met with criticism 
i frankly dont believe there are a whole lot of other 
alternatives 
massachusetts has laid off 1711 workers leaving fewer social 
workers for abused children virginia has laid off 700 state 
employees including college faculty and staff gov l douglas 
wilder has ordered a mental hospital closed 
los angeles and louisville ky have closed health centers 
vermont and maryland put off programs to pay prescription for the 
elderly delaware postponed a program to fight drug and alcohol 
abuse among pregnant women 
education also has suffered state college tuitions are rising 
in massachusetts new hampshire north carolina virginia and new 
jersey new york city faces teacher layoffs lower perpupil 
funding will mean fewer new teachers and larger classroom 
populations in kansas 
snow removal is being cut concord nh wont bring out the 
plows until it snows 4 inches so far the state capitol has been 
spared a snowstorm 
were kind of operating on a wing and a prayer at this 
point said assistant city manager julia griffin 
many places have put off repairs on sewer systems roads and 
bridges 
there might be a road not paved or plowed or a water or sewer 
system not upgraded said lash chaffin of the league of nebraska 
municipalities those are the kinds of things that come back to 
haunt you in future years but they are things the public doesnt 
see 
other cuts are highly visible a 20 million deficit has forced 
los angeles to impose a sevenmonth hiring freeze on the police 
department at a time when the homicide rate approaches a record 
the budget ax has fallen on rich and poor communities 
washington dc mayorelect sharon pratt dixon promises to cut 
2000 workers in the face of a 100 million revenue shortfall 
officials in washingtons affluent suburbs of montgomery county 
md and fairfax county va say they will be forced to make sharp 
cuts 
some communities are still looking to taxes to avoid painful 
cuts the los angeles county board of supervisors is studying 
increased taxes on utilities and hotel rooms new york city is 
contemplating a similar move on hotel bills 
but many have been to the tax trough only to see deficits 
continue to grow arizona faces a 108 million deficit despite a 
250 million tax increase last spring new jersey with more than 
28 billion in new taxes faces a 600 million deficit new york 
has raised taxes 3 billion over the last two years 
a survey this spring of national league of cities 15000 
members found 76 percent had already increased charges for services 
like garbage collection forty percent had raised property taxes 
yet officials still strive to find places to cut 
in dutchess county ny which faces the elimination of 75

an antiterrorism expert hired by pan 
am said wednesday he was told the xray machine in frankfurt the 
german city where flight 103 originated may not have been working 
that day 
retired lt col wilfred wood told a public inquiry into the dec 
21 1988 terrorist bombing of flight 103 that he had been hired by 
pan american world airways to set up the airlines security 
subsidiary known as alert 
the boeing 747 which blew up over lockerbie scotland left all 
259 people on board dead and killed 11 on the ground after 
originating in frankfurt it stopped at londons heathrow airport 
for a transfer to the new yorkbound jumbo jet 
wood told the inquiry now in its 10th week that security 
official ulrich weber told him the day after the disaster that the 
xray machine at frankfurt might not have been working the previous 
day i was shocked rigid and very upset wood said i was 
appalled 
the machine is used to xray luggage to ensure it does not carry

was set up six months before the disaster

london was reduced from weeks to days xray operators were trained 
for an hour or two he said

the doctor who performed the worlds first 
liver transplant said wednesday hell perform fewer surgeries and 
more research as the university of pittsburgh creates the worlds 
first transplant institute 
this is a switch in gears said dr thomas starzl its 
part of a thing thats been going on for a long time 
starzl 64 who underwent surgery in august to clear a clogged 
artery near his heart said he only will perform surgeries in cases 
with unusual problems or experimental procedures 
he made his comments on his future at a news conference to 
discuss an experimental antirejection drug that will be tested on 
people with diabetes 
starzl said he will concentrate on developing pitts 
transplantation institute which was chartered in 1986 it will be 
modeled after the nations leading cancer treatment institutes he 
said 
centers performing transplants around the world are all part of 
larger hospitals or clinics but pitts will be the first 
freestanding facility he said 
starzl attempted the worlds first liver transplant in 1963 at 
the university of colorado in denver he performed the first 
successful liver transplant there four years later 
starzl also pioneered techniques in kidney transplants 
the field has come so far and failures have become such a 
rarity in the developmental days when many patients died the 
loss was less difficult to see than the few patients who die now 
starzl said now when you fail it creates much sharper 
questions 
stormie jones 13 of white settlement texas the worlds first 
and longestsurviving recipient of a heartliver transplant died 
nov 10 at childrens hospital of pittsburgh when she suddenly 
rejected her transplanted heart 
starzl who led the team that did the heartliver transplant in 
1984 was reluctant to discuss her case wednesday but distributed 
copies of a statement on his plans and the eulogy he delivered at a 
recent pittsburgh memorial service for stormie and other childrens 
patients 
the lot of physicians who care for the desperately ill is to 
reconcile grief with the determination to make things better the 
statement said without the sense of personal loss that goes with 
a dear name and face there is little progress and no incentive for 
striving except for personal or professional ambition 
pitt transplant researchers are wrestling with methods of 
transplanting intestines which patients reject easily starzl told 
reporters 
theyre the achilles heel of multiple transplants he said 
but doctors were encouraged by four successful intestine 
transplants that were performed here this year

israeli fruit german sausages italian 
cheese and american medical supplies are among the products 
arriving in the soviet union as part of a worldwide private effort 
to ease winter shortages 
while the governments of the united states sweden and other 
countries have no formal plans yet to organize food aid private 
groups and individuals are rallying to rush food to the soviets 
relief organizations have chartered planes used aeroflot 
flights and organized truck convoys to get past the vast countrys 
transportation bottlenecks several organizations have sent staff 
members to ensure that food and medicine reach their destinations 
the soviet government which blames food problems on the 
collapse of its central distribution system has not officially 
asked for the food but the chronic shortages have worsened 
dramaticaly this winter 
consumers must wait in long lines often for as long as three 
hours for basics such as butter sometimes pushing and shoving 
breaks out over a scarce item 
the country doesnt have enough rail cars or refrigerated trucks 
to transport food from the fields to markets nor are there 
sufficient storage facilities there has been widespread theft and 
diversion to the black market 
the european community has drafted an aid package to be adopted 
next week providing about 2 billion in food and transportation 
over two years 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev meanwhile has made deals 
involving loans and export credits to buy basic foods and consumer 
products to fill empty store shelves 
but individuals and private organizations have gone ahead on 
their own to help orphanages hospitals and pensioners 
tore waeraass a norwegian slaughterhouse owner is driving a 
truck carrying three tons of sausages to the soviet city of 
murmansk 
im a bit suspicious of the mafia in murmansk but people from 
the church have promised to help us so that it will be families 
with children who get the christmas gift he said 
the first aid to reach moscow a planeload of food from german 
charities arrived on nov 29 trucks met the aeroflot flight and 
took 25000 packages of flour sugar sausage and lard to 
childrens hospitals and orphanages 
the german red cross and the caritas organization sent convoys 
of trucks vans and buses stuffed with food packages last week 
more caravans are planned later this month 
and soviet soldiers on wednesday unloaded an emergency 10ton 
shipment of israeli watermelons tomatoes and oranges that israeli 
leaders said were a gesture of thanks for allowing thousands of 
soviet jews to emigrate 
on thursday israels quasigovernmental jewish agency was to 
send 15 tons of powdered milk to childrens hospitals in moscow 
leningrad and kiev said yehuda weinraub an agency spokesman 
in london british children began a campaign wednesday to 
collect food for soviet youngsters organizers urged every british 
school child to donate a can of food and each british school to 
send at least one parcel 
a british management consultant announced a cooperative effort 
with moscow officials to improve the delivery of bread and milk in 
the soviet capital keith burgess head of a fiveman team from 
andersen consulting that spent three days in moscow said in the 
short run we will focus on squeezing that extra bit of capacity 
out of the system to make sure there is enough to eat this winter 
in the long run the aim is to rework the food supply system 
the italian aid group together for peace flew 14 tons of 
milk tuna cheese vegetables syringes and medicine to a 
childrens hospital in moscow last weekend 
the american relief agency care concerned about the effect a 
sustained shortage could have on gorbachevs government this week 
began an operation to distribute more than 50000 packages of food 
to residents in leningrad and moscow 
the connecticutbased relief group americares sent 4000 tons of 
powdered protein drink aspirin and antibiotics dec 1 for 
orphanages and childrens hospitals the aid collected from 
companies and individuals was the first private american aid 
flight into the soviet union said spokesman dwain schenck 
our state department says they dont see a real famine problem 
and shortage but the fact is a lot of people over there are 
suffering schenck said 
the us and several western governments say there are 
shortages but not widespread hunger 
but some governments are taking steps to organize food aid 
japan which has already promised medical assistance announced 
wednesday it would set up a clearinghouse for private food aid to 
the soviet union 
switzerland plans an emergency airlift this week 
the impression is that the shop shelves are empty and 
refrigerators full in the soviet union said norwegian church aid 
spokesman helge kjollesdal 
but even if there is no acute starvation in the real sense 
there can easily be difficult situations at childrens and old 
peoples homes and among other underprivileged groups who do not 
manage to hoard

negotiators involved in 107nation free 
trade talks reported failure wednesday in their efforts to resolve 
a nasty fight over farm subsidies with some trade ministers 
suggesting the discussions are on the verge of breaking down 
it is a stalemate and it is serious said a grimfaced us 
trade representative carla hills 
officials said there would be another effort at a breakthrough 
thursday 
high noon is tomorrow thursday said canadian trade 
minister john crobie if there is no change then it is over 
the trade ministers emerged just before midnight from a twohour 
meeting in which they sought in vain for a compromise position on 
the expensive subsidies that developed countries pay to their 
farmers 
an indian official commerce minister subramanian swamy was 
pessimistic saying it looks like they are heading for 
suspension 
if the talks are broken off even for a brief time it would put 
the entire fouryear effort at trade reform in jeopardy because of 
the tight deadlines negotiators had faced to submit a completed 
document to the us congress 
the dispute pitted the 12nation european community against much 
of the rest of the world including large farm exporters such as 
the united states brazil and argentina 
european officials had been expected wednesday to agree to at 
least a modest expansion of their offer to reduce internal farm 
support payments by 30 percent 
instead the europeans emerged from their separate meeting 
saying they had decided to make no further offer on farm subsidies 
until the united states made compromises on other issues 
there had also been hope that the european position might change 
as a result of a meeting wednesday night in paris between german 
chancellor helmut kohl and french president francois mitterrand 
but following that discussion no new offer was announced 
crosbie described the mood inside the discussions as somber 
and said the meeting thursday would determine whether there was any 
point in continuing the talks 
we are going to have to decide whether we are going to give it 
all up or not he said 
the farm subsidy fight evolved as the biggest stumbling block to 
conclusion of the most ambitious round of trade liberalization 
talks ever undertaken the negotiations known as the uruguay round 
for the country where they began in 1986 had been scheduled to 
wrap up friday after five days of marathon bargaining 
but after three days the talks remained stalemated and some 
delegations talked openly about the possibility of giving up and 
going home 
the united states has got to recognize that this is a 
negotiation between equals not a group of people to be pushed 
around in this way said british agriculture secretary john 
gummer 
otto schlecht germanys deputy economics minister said we 
have no reason to go to the americans on our knees 
gummer said the europeans had insisted on american compromise 
offers in areas including trade in services textiles nnd 
investment to be made at the same time that discussions went 
forward on the farm issue he said the us side had rejected that 
proposal 
us officials said the europeans were engaging in a desperate 
attempt to shift the blame for failure of the negotiations 
what is holding up the negotiations here is that the european 
community has not yet provided a proposal on agriculture us 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said 
the european community entered the negotiations offering to trim 
domestic farm support payments by 30 percent the united states 
supported by major farm exporting countries was seeking much 
deeper cuts of 75 percent in domestic supports and import barriers 
and a 90 percent cut in export subsidies 
the trade talks the eighth in a series of negotiations dating 
to 1947 offered the promise of lowering prices for consumers while 
at the same time boosting economic prosperity especially in third 
world countries with farmbased economies 
the united states has argued that without sufficient progress in 
agriculture developed nations will not be able to win concessions 
from third world countries to reform their trade practices 
including agreement on tough new rules to protect against copyright 
piracy something that costs american businesses an estimated 60 
billion in lost sales annually 
negotiators spoke pessimistically about a failure of the talks 
which many fear could trigger a rise of protectionism and global 
trade wars similar to the events of the 1930s that were blamed for 
making the great depression more severe 
anyone who does not admit that the round is in deep crisis is 
just deluding themselves said australian trade minister neal 
blewett

a south carolina viewer who saw the words 
adultery and shock therapy during commercial breaks on 
cbs guiding light wasnt seeing subliminal messages the 
network said wednesday 
because of a small technical problem in new york the 
columbia woman saw the first part of taped promotions for geraldo 
riveras syndicated talk show that were supposed to appear only on 
wcbstv in new york the network said 
it was utterly innocent said a network executive who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
the brief appearance of the promotional announcements 
accidentally went out on the network during the pauses it puts in 
the guiding light daytime soap opera for local commercials 
aired by affiliates the executive said 
the goof came to light because of the sharp eyes of viewer julie 
moore 
she said that while looking at episodes of the soap opera she 
taped last week she spotted the word adultery in large type 
imposed over the cbs logo during a commercial break the words 
shock therapy appeared in the same way in the tape of the next 
days show 
the shows appeared on the cbs affiliate in columbia sc 
wltxtv 
i didnt know what it was until i ran the tape back said 
moore who said she discovered the words when she advanced the tape 
slowly 
dick laughridge the stations general manager said he was 
flabbergasted when shown the videotapes tuesday wltx made copies 
of them and sent them to cbs officials in new york 
embarrassed cbs officials issued a terse statement 
there was a small technical problem in the way our network 
computers switch to local stations the network said 
then alluding to the accidental transmission of the geraldo 
promotions on the network it said 
occasionally a fraction of a second of another feed will air 
in this case it was a promo for an upcoming show to air on wcbstv 
in new york we are taking steps to correct this problem

a consumer advocacy organization wednesday 
asked chrysler corp to recall 500000 cars and minivans equipped 
with a complex automatic transmission system the company rejected 
the request as completely without merit 
the center for auto safety said in a letter to chrysler chairman 
lee iacocca the ultradrive transmission had performed poorly since 
its introduction in the 1989 model year and that its durability was 
questionable 
owners complain that the transmissions stick between gears 
causing clutch burnout computer controller failure and internal 
transmission damage said the letter from clarence ditlow 
executive director of the center 
ultradrives dismal showing in its first two years on the road 
earns it the dubious distinction of the worlds most defective 
transmission ditlow wrote 
chrysler spokesman tony cervone said ditlows description of 
problems with the transmission were grossly exaggerated the 
recall suggestion is completely without merit and his allegations 
regarding safety hazards in connection with this transmission are 
totally irresponsible cervone said 
the nations thirdlargest automaker introduced the ultradrive 
fourspeed transmission in late 1988 
it was offered on the 1989 1990 and 1991 dodge dynasty spirit 
and caravan minivan plymouth acclaim and voyager minivan 
it was available as standard or optional equipment on the 1990 
and 1991 chrysler imperial lebarons new yorker and town amp country 
minivan as well as the dodge daytona 
ultradriveequipped vehicles comprise 24 percent of vehicles 
sold in the united states since the new transmission was 
introduced but 233 percent of the vehicles that have prompted 
complaints to the center for auto safety and the national highway 
traffic safety administration have had ultradrive ditlow said 
nhtsa the safety arm of the department of transportation has 
received 161 complaints about chrysler transmissions during the 
1989 and 1990 model years ditlow said ranking second is general 
motors corp with 91 complaints 
gm sold more than 5 million cars and trucks in 1989 while 
chrysler sold more than 2 million 
the letters consumers have written point to an alarming 
pattern of repeated premature ultradrive failures ditlow wrote 
many owners have described harrowing experiences when 
transmissions gave out during travel he said 
cervone said most problems with the transmissions had been 
identified and fixed early in 1989 and it is now fully 
competitive from reliability standpoints and ahead of the 
competition in many other areas

a judge will decide if lastminute 
absentee ballots can determine the outcome of a runoff for mayor of 
berkeley 
incumbent mayor loni hancocks apparent victory margin over lead 
challenger fred weekes was narrow enough that the outcome could 
hang on absentee ballots on which the court fight is focusing 
tuesdays runoff was forced when hancock a leader of the citys 
liberal berkeley citizens action party got 499 percent of the 
vote nov 6 just missing the 50percentplusone requirement 
bcas liberal democratic coalition has dominated city politics for 
a decade 
on friday alameda county superior court judge howard schwartz 
will hear arguments on whether absentee ballots that arrived after 
the polls closed tuesday should be counted 
the election code says absentee ballots can be counted only if 
received by election day but hancocks opponents say as many as 
3000 of 8000 requested ballots werent mailed out until last 
week reaching voters as late as monday 
we wont know the number of ballots involved for a while 
city clerk marie mcketchnie said wednesday 
hancock led weekes a city councilman by only 590 votes in 
unofficial results of tuesdays election 
but weekes a moderate democrat who wants to eliminate 
ideological practices from city hall asked the judge to allow 
the counting of mailin ballots postmarked before the polls closed 
but not received until after election day 
there are a large number of uncounted ballots out there 
said weekes i dont know how large but it could change the 
outcome 
with all 116 precincts reporting weekes trailed hancock 16682 
to 16092 but led 2403 to 1624 among early absentee ballots 
depending on the judges decision remaining absentee ballots 
could change the outcome but a spokesman for hancock who during 
the campaign promised to continue berkeleys liberal tradition was 
confident the mayor would remain in office given her edge 
if the absentee ballots split in the same ratio as the earlier 
absentee ballots there is no way mr weekes can win the 
election said malcom bernstein treasurer of the hancock 
campaign 
mcketchnies office was swamped with requests for absentee 
ballots after the special election was announced 
we got applications from all over the world she said 
hancock 52 is the most prominent member of the berkeley 
citizens action party born in the fervor of the 1960s antivietnam 
war youth and civil rights movements 
the coalition lost control of the council and the rent board in 
the november election hancocks defeat could mean the end of the 
groups dominance

an explosion and a 1000volt electric 
arc spitting sparks and smoke at a rail station prompted 
authorities to evacuate about 1000 san franciscobound commuters 
wednesday morning 
no injuries were reported during the explosion and subsequent 
arcing that occurred about 9 am at the 19th street bay area rapid 
transit rail station said ray cole acting manager of system 
safety 
the operator of the 10car train ordered the station evacuated 
i was in the front of the train and i heard this loud bump 
said commuter clint danbury 33 there were lots of yellow sparks 
and smoke and there was about 20 seconds of panic 
one oman moaned oh my god oh my god but several others 
said lets calm down it was pretty scary in a dark tunnel in the 
ground 
technicians were investigating why the rail that carries the 
electrical current that powers the train began flashing and 
generating sparks and smoke cole said 
a heavy electrical current flashed into the metalwork behind the 
wall panels on one side of the station and melted brackets 
supporting decorative metal strips at the other end 
all traffic to and from the 19th and 12th street stations in 
oakland was shut down for about an hour until id the groups program surprised 
journalists and even 
some members of the bloc who were already disagreeing with some 
provisions during the press conference 
sentiment for a crackdown is widespread in the communist party 
which holds a majority in most legislative bodies on the national 
and local level many communists want gorbachev to call a state of 
emergency and enforce it through the armed forces and the kgb 
security police 
the national salvation committee seemed to have the same goals 
although they were not spelled out clearly during the news 
conference called to announce the groups formation 
the soviet economy is crumbling the old central system is 
failing and grocery shelves in major cities are bare 
with all but one of the 15 soviet republics seeking some form of 
independence or autonomy from central government many officials 
fear the collapse of the union 
yeltsin president of the russian republic warned officers at 
the dzerzhinsky military academy in moscow against a military coup 
if the army enters our boiling society as an active factor 
confrontation will increase many times and carry the society to 
catastrophe he said 
i am categorically opposed to any possibility of escaping the 
crisis with force oprating through the army 
first of all the army cannot solve the economic problem and 
today the economy is the greatest concern just the reverse such a 
development will deprive us of the last chance for a positive 
result it will deprive us of the chance to escape a civil war 
yeltsin said any interference by the army in internal 
political affairs will simply blow up the army from inside it 
could split into small groups fighting each other 
the tough political struggle which today remains peaceful 
could grow into an armed conflict he said taking into account 
that we are a nuclear power such a development would immediately 
create a threat not only to life in our country but in the whole 
world 
yeltsin has led the drive for shifting power from the central 
government to the republics as a result hardliners feel he has 
contributed to forces splintering the country

after leaving michigan wendy stanek mother of seven worked 
undercover for agents in arizona 
it got too touchy god if i didnt have the kids id stay 
out there and do it stanek said tuesday by telephone back in 
the same crystal falls house she moved out of several months ago 
stanek took it upon herself to penetrate the drug trade in her 
small hometown near the michiganwisconsin line her freelance 
work for the state polices upper peninsula substance enforcement 
team or upset led to the december 1989 arrests of 22 people on 
cocaine and marijuana charges 
authorities heralded the operations success but threats 
against stanek and her children persuaded her to move her family 
four months later into hiding near show low ariz 
stanek 36 and divorced said she made slow and uneasy progress 
in undercover work for the navajo county ariz drug task force 
thats the first time i felt very uncomfortable i was into 
cutofffinger times 
all the while her kids were homesick for michigan 
it was the kids stanek said they didnt like it 
arleigh richmond chief deputy of the navajo county sheriffs 
department said the task force had great expectations when stanek 
volunteered to do undercover work in the mountainous southeastern 
arizona county but after two months she failed to make any buys 
we tried to work her as an agent here we had no success 
richmond said i think she had pretty much told everybody what 
and who she was when she got here we wasted quite a bit of money 
before we found that out

narcotics here

cnn has decided to allow court transcripts of its 
manuel noriega prison tapes to be made public without further legal 
battles the network and its attorney said wednesday 
us district judge william hoeveler ruled tuesday the 
transcripts could be released thursday unless cnn decided to take 
the case to a higher court 
cnn has decided not to appeal network attorney terry 
bienstock said adding that cnns primary concern had always been 
to protect its confidential source 
we dont think the transcripts in and of themselves will 
jeopardize the source he said 
cnn spokesman steve haworth said many of the conversations were 
in code and that without supporting documents they would not be 
meaningful in any case 
sanford bohrer attorney for four media organizations that asked 
for the transcripts applauded cnns decision 
i think it was the right decision because judge hoevelers was 
the right decision bohrer said i could never understand how 
cnn could claim to own conversations that were taped by the united 
states government of an inmate in a federal prison 
the news organizations seeking the tapes were the miami herald 
the associated press postnewsweek station wplgtv of miami 
gannett co inc and usa today which gannett owns they argued the 
public has a right to examine the content of tapes that set off a 
freespeech controversy that went to the us supreme court 
cnn has televised some of the seven tapes at issue and argued 
that the recordings and therefore the transcripts were its 
property cnn accused other news organizations of professional 
jealousy and said the transcripts should be burned or returned 
to the network 
but the judges decision ruled the tape transcripts were public 
documents because the information was originally compiled by 
noriega and the government not cnn 
the tapes controversy began last month when cnn aired a series 
of telecasts based on noriegas telephone conversations somehow 
leaked to the network the judge ordered the telecasts stopped 
pending his review of he tapes a move cnn opposed as 
unconstitutional prior restraint of the press 
the supreme court decided not to intervene and the judge after 
reviewing the transcripts determined there was no threat to 
noriegas right to a fair trial and said the tapes could be aired 
cnn hasnt said where it got the tapes but noriegas attorneys 
said the tapes were released to the government of panama by the 
state department or the drug enforcement administration and that 
panamanians gave them to cnn 
noriega is awaiting trial on charges of taking 46 million in 
payoffs to protect the cocaine trade passing through panama from 
colombia to the united states

a group that is dedicated to helping jews 
leave the soviet union said wednesday that it would not object if 
the bush administration agreed to give agriculture credits to the 
soviet union 
surpluses of wheat and corn have beaten down prices and farm 
belt lawmakers are urging president bush to lift the restrictions 
on the soviet union so the bumper crop can be sold 
we either smell it or we sell it and this whole situation 
smells said rep pat roberts rkan who slammed his hand a few 
times at a house agriculture subcommittee hearing 
shoshana cardin chairwoman of the national conference on soviet 
jewry said the soviets had made substantial progress in 
allowing jews to leave or permitting them to study teach and 
maintain their religion language and culture 
another jewish group the union of councils for soviet jews 
said bush should send only emergency food aid 
to permit sales on credit bush would have to exempt moscow from 
a 1974 law that prohibits credit to countries with restrictive 
emigration laws in the past us administrations have insisted 
that the soviet union had to embody its emigration liberalization 
into law but last week the president said he was considering a 
waiver 
roberts rep dan glickman dkan and other defenders of wheat 
and corn farmers say preventing exports to the soviet union is 
similar to a grain embargo 
the amount of food moving into soviet cities is so inadequate 
that last weeks newspapers were reporting soviets literally 
fighting over food in grocery stores with nearly empty shelves 
said glickman who chaired the hearing of the wheat soybeans and 
feed grains subcommittee 
the time is now to help mikhail gorbachev and our farmers 
glickman said 
f paul dickerson associate administrator of the foreign 
agricultural service an arm of the agriculture department told 
lawmakers that he could not comment directly on the issue 
he said however that the glut of us wheat is part of a 
record crop worldwide and buying countries are not making big 
purchases because they expect that prices will continue to drop 
we do not anticipate that shortages will lead to widespread 
hunger or imminent starvation in the foreseeable future 
dickerson said again we believe that public reports predicting 
famine or widespread hunger are overdrawn and premature

cbc officials announced wednesday spending cuts of 
108 million forcing the elimination of 1100 jobs and the 
curtailing of local television newscasts entertainment and 
childrens programs 
the shortfall is due to government funding cuts inflation 
declining television advertising and other costs like new taxes 
and pension funding said gerard veilleux president of the 
canadian broadcasting corp 
the cuts represent just under 10 percent of cbcs 12 billion 
annual budget about 900 million of that comes from government and 
the rest from ad revenue the cbc employs about 10000 people and 
the layoffs are its worst ever 
speaking at a news conference veilleux said the 108 million in 
spending cuts means eliminating 1100 jobs and closing or reducing 
the operations of 11 cbc television stations the cuts go into 
effect april 1 but some effects will be felt immediately 
these decisions have given me many sleepless nights 
veilleux told cbc employees via a closedcircuit televised 
announcement i can only trust were doing the right thing 
with the cuts each canadian province will have no more than one 
english and one frenchlanguage station 
closed immediately will be stations in goose bay newfoundland 
and matane quebec the local news production at cbc toronto will 
also cease although the network will still provide local

the 20million annual cost to run radio canada international the 
international shortwave radio service or the 45million cost of 
the english and french parliamentary channels which broadcast 
house of commons proceedings cbc will ask the government to pick 
up the tab for these operations 
in addition english and french radio network budgets will be 
cut by 1 percent the following year 2 percent will be trimmed 
from their budgets 
newsworld cbcs allnews cable channel is not supposed to be

a black parent who complained that two 
classics by mark train were racially offensive said he was 
disappointed that school board members decided wednesday to keep 
the books as required reading 
there should have been more consideration given to the problem 
than take it back to square one david perry said 
perry said he was pleased with the public review of the 
adventures of tom sawyer and the adventures of huckleberry 
finn 
i think the process was a good one for the community because i 
think there was a dialogue that was very very needed he 
said 
perry said he had high regard for 500 high school students who 
circulated a petition to retain huckleberry finn saying they 
got a chance to hear the black perspective on the book 
school board members capped a fivehour meeting by voting 
unanimously to keep the books on the required reading list 
perry received a standing ovation when he accused the books of 
portraying blacks in a racist degrading manner 
no matter what the depiction of time i think any writer and 
any orator who has to use the word nigger more than 300 times in 
a presentation leaves something to be desired perry said 
the hearing stemmed from perrys complaint about his daughters 
discomfort while reading tom sawyer at his urging the school 
boards materials review committee agreed to take the books off the 
required list and make them optional reading 
both books were written by samuel langhorne clemens who used 
the pen name mark twain tom sawyer written in 1876 is drawn 
from twains boyhood in hannibal mo huckleberry finn was 
published in england in 1884 and in the united states in 1885 
plano students first meet tom in the seventh grade and read 
about hucks adventures in the 11th grade 
among the high school students speaking in favor of the book was 
joanne savage 
to remove the book from the taught reading in the curriculum 
would be a step in the wrong direction she said 
the book has the ability to provoke much thoughtful discussion 
about this problem racism instead of ignoring it and pretending 
that it is solved joanne said 
after receiving complaints last year about huckleberry finn 
the plano independent school district hired a university of north 
texas assistant professor in english to give teachers lessons about 
how to present huck with sensitivity 
perry doubted that is working 
when someone assumes they can teach the word nigger in a way 
that is not offense i have a problem it cant be done he said 
the word has a searing effect that just goes to the soul of a 
black person perry said by its very nature and design it is 
intended to be extremely offensive take away your identity and 
destroy your soul 
he suggested that a better step toward sensitizing students 
would be for the school district to recognize february as black 
history month and conduct appropriate programs

gordon humphrey left the us senate for a 
seat wednesday in a state senate that for the first time in years 
has a strong democratic presence 
well its not what i quite had in mind the republican

majority and i figured this is really going to be great ill go 
back theres a big republican margin itll be a piece of cake

republicans and 11 democrats had yet to elect even a temporary 
presiding officer to oversee the election of a senate president

its a good thing i did it humphrey said of his decision to 
resign early 
humphrey 49 honored a campaign promise this year by bypassing 
almost certain reelection and not seeking a third term 
he said moving from the national limelight to relative obscurity 
in a 24member chamber has its advantages 
it has a much more manageable feel to it than congress he 
said i think theres diversity here but were all from the 
state of new hampshire and its not like trying to rectify the 
interests of the entire country

cardinal john oconnor should have read a new 
book that traces the roman catholic churchs historical treatment 
of women and sexual morality before he criticized it in print the 
publisher said wednesday 
oconnor spiritual leader of the new york roman catholic 
archdiocese admitted he had not read eunuchs for the kingdom of 
heaven but he has read the books dust jacket which he attacked 
as catholicbashing 
thomas cahill director of religious publishing at doubleday 
said the book by german theologian uta rankeheinemann is a 
scholarly work that begs to be taken seriously 
there is something almost comical about condemning a jacket 
rather than a book cahill said if one wants to challenge it 
one should have read it and wrestled with its arguments 
the cardinals spokesman joe zwilling said wednesday i 
think doubleday is trying to get publicity for themselves in trying 
to get the new york times to write about this the times reported 
the dispute between the cardinal and the publishing house 
wednesday 
there is far too much tolerance of attacks on the catholic 
church zwilling said 
the book a bestseller in germany and italy arrived last month 
in us book stores 
ms rankeheinemann a professor of the history of religion at 
essen university in germany traces 2000 years of the roman 
catholic churchs attitudes toward women and sexual morality and 
accuses the church of both degrading women and undermining members 
sexuality 
catholic moral theology is a folly that invokes god and 
pretends to be religious she wrote in the book it has warped 
the consciences of many men and women it has burdened them with 
hairsplitting nonsense and striven to train them as moral acrobats 
instead of making them more humane and kinder to their fellow human 
beings 
after receiving a copy from doubleday last month the cardinal 
wrote about the dust jacket in a column entitled a seed of 
hatred in the weekly publication catholic new york 
oconnor wrote that he was not suggesting censorship for a 
moment 
he added i am suggesting that it is time we stopped buying 
the line of purveyors of hatred and scandal and malice and libel 
and calumny its time we tell them we are sick of their 
perversions 
in particular oconnor attacked use of the word proves 
instead of contends or alleges to describe what the author does 
in the book 
cahill said peter heinegg who translated the book and wrote the 
dust jacket description used the word proves as it is used 
in academic circles that the author states her thesis and backs 
it up 
cahill a roman catholic said he was really offended that 
the cardinal had dismissed the book in such a cavalier manner 
and he was doubly offended by his extremely misguided attempt to 
accuse doubleday of being anticatholic

president bush said wednesday i 
am not optimistic that saddam hussein will withdraw without a 
fight from kuwait and vowed that iraq will not be offered any 
concessions to end the crisis peacefully 
i have no feeling whatsoever that saddam hussein is willing to 
do now that which he should have done five months ago four months 
ago bush said 
bushs tough approach was echoed by argentine president carlos 
menem of argentina the only latin american leader to send frigates 
to the persian gulf to enforce the embargo against iraq 
we wholeheartedly condemn what iraq has done to invade and 
occupy a territory which does not belong to it menem said at a 
joint news conference with bush the only way is for iraq to 
withdraw without any preconditions 
midway through a tour of south america bush met with menem at 
casa rosada the presidents palace within eyesight of the army 
headquarters seized by rebels in a shortlived military uprising 
monday 
bush congratulated menem for ending the rebellion quickly the 
argentine people proved again this week that they will not permit 
any group to return argentina to the days of violence and 
dictatorship in a superb show of strength and commitment bush 
said 
the president got a redcarpet welcome a procession of 
presidential grenadiers on horseback led bushs motorcade to the 
hall of congress for an address to lawmakers 
let those who would attack constitutional democracy 
understand in latin america the day of the dictator is over 
bssh declared to the congress 
bush got his greatest applause for his remark when a deputy 
luis zamora of the movement to socialism tried to interrupt for a 
speech of his own and was shouted down by his colleagues 
if that is the price you have to pay for democracy lets pay 
it bush said i feel welcome here 
zamora took part in an antibush demonstration of about 200 
people later telling reporters he did not want to be part of 
this farce 
bush also praised menem for his tough freemarket reforms to 
cure argentinas inflation estimated at upwards of 2000 percent 
in 1990 
we know of the painful shortterm sacrifices you are being 
called upon to make in what your own president has called surgery 
without anesthesia bush said for this tremendous undertaking 
to succeed it will not take miracles it will take work 
bush was menems guest at an evening rodeo and a state dinner 
in his toast the president lauded menem saying you have helped 
reestablish argentinas democratic tradition and i salute your 
bold reform of the economy 
bush also expressed appreciation for menems support in the 
persian gulf together we will do what is right and good the 
president said 
menem presented bush and his daughter dorothy leblond with two 
gift horses piebald and sorrel mounts used to herd cattle and at 
the dinner two knives of the kind used by argentine gauchos 
cowboys 
the persian gulf crisis a half world away continued to loom 
large on bushs tour as well as in washington secretary of state 
james a baker iii told congress the united states will strike 
suddenly massively and decisively if military force is needed 
to force iraq to withdraw 
in buenos aires bushs mood turned solemn when he was 
approached during a diplomatic reception by the iraqi ambassador to 
argentina sahibhussain tahir as required by protocol bush 
quickly shook hands with the diplomat but wore a stern look on his 
face in contrast to the warm smile he gave other ambassadors 
later at the news conference bush said there are no signs of a 
deal or any retreat by saddam despite the us threat of force 
im not optimistic bush said i see no evidence that 
saddam hussein is ready to comply fully without condition to the 
un resolutions 
bush has authorized baker to go to baghdad for talks with saddam 
and has invited iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz to meet with him 
in washington iraqi officials have accepted bushs offer and say 
the talks are an opening to negotiations with give and take by 
both sides 
bush however said the talks would be confined within the 
limits of un resolutions setting terms for peace in the persian 
gulf 
that means no concession of territory bush said he said 
iraq also must release foreign hostages and respect the integrity 
of embassies and that means the eventual security and stability 
in the gulf although thats not specified in the un 
resolution 
bush said there are frequent rumors about a deal to end the gulf 
crisis but that every time an iraqi official speaks publicly he 
says they will not withdraw from kuwait 
bush said there must be no attempt to find a facesaving retreat 
by saddam when naked aggression takes place its not a question 
of finding saving face for the aggressor bush said heatedly 
when a country is literally raped and pillaged should the world 
go out and try to find a way to save face for he who has raped and 
pillaged that country 
asked by an argentine journalist how the united states would 
reward argentina for sending ships to the gulf bush replied i 
dont believe argentina is sending frigates to the gulf to help the 
united states they believe as we do that we must stand up 
against this brutal aggression 
menem agreed that argentina sought nothing in return that 
would be undignified we dont want any help or aid and in 
fact were it offered we would not accept it 
on a separate matter bush said global trade talks underway in 
brussels must tackle agriculture subsidies or the talks will fail 
he promised that if that round fails we will work bilaterally 
with the argentines to see that their trade with us is not set 
back the european communitys reluctance to curb protectionist 
measures for its farmers is jeopardizing the negotiations 
asked if the united states would enact retaliatory subsidies 
against europe if the talks failed bush said im not in the 
business of talking retaliation while people are still meeting and 
discussing this

the us defense secretary on wednesday 
wished lech walesa victory and success in the presidential 
runoff and two new polls indicated the solidarity chairman was 
opening up a wide lead over his rival 
a survey by the stateowned polling service cbos found walesa 
preferred by 58 percent in a sample of adults intending to vote in 
sundays runoff compared to 23 percent for emigre businessman 
stanislaw tyminski nineteen percent were undecided 
the survey was conducted between sunday and tuesday and had a 5 
percent margin of error it was released wednesday night by the pap 
news agency the number of people polled was not immediately 
available 
the private demoskop polling agency had walesa with a 31 edge 
over the darkhorse challenger in a survey also published 
wednesday 
tyminski traveled through the southwestern silesia region 
looking for votes among coal miners worried about unemployment 
earlier his campaign labeled as slanders and lies a tuesday 
night telecast in which a canadian couple accused tyminski of 
abusing his wife and denying food and medicine to his children in 
recent years 
and in an interview published wednesday in the progovernment 
newspaper gazeta wyborcza tyminski said outgoing prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki was a stalinist whose governent chose a 
totalitarian road 
tyminski also said questions about his past and his 
qualifications raised by the press were rubbish 
the press has discredited itself of its own accord he said 
they were all working for the government 
us defense secretary dick cheney wrapping up a twoday visit 
to poland met for 40 minutes with walesa at solidarity 
headquarters in gdansk 
i have certain political experience and i feel that i have 
talked today with the man who will win said the former 
republican congressman i wish you victory and success in this 
difficult task 
the remarks in front of reporters appeared to be a calculated 
attempt to rally voters for walesa and against tyminski who had 
implied to coal miners on tuesday night that he had the confidence 
of us authorities 
tyminski told a rally in the silesian city of jastrzebie he was 
invited to meet with cheney but preferred to be with them 
a us source however said tyminski was only on the guest list 
for an embassy reception for cheney and no private meeting was ever 
contemplated 
tyminski leader of the fringe libertarian party of canada and 
an advocate of nuclear weapons for poland has sought to portray 
himself as a business magnate with contacts with government 
officials worldwide 
he traveled to walbrzych one of polands mostpolluted cities 
near the german and czechoslovak border where five unprofitable 
mines were recently slated for liquidation by the government and 
addressed a rally of at least 3000 cheering supporters at an 
arena 
the demoskop poll indicated a walesa lead of 61 percent to 20 
percent over tyminski with 19 percent undecided 
the survey commissioned by the governmentowned daily 
rzeczpospolita questioned 988 people nationwide tuesday the error 
margin was 3 percent 
a poll by state tv taken a week earlier had walesa leading 58 
percent to 30 percent 
tyminski said tuesday his own surveys indicated he was trailing 
walesa 44 percent to 50 percent with his support growing by 15 
percent daily 
the accusations that tyminski had abused his wife were made by a 
woman identified as clara fox and her husband in a taped interview 
on polish tv tuesday 
the couple presented home photographs of themselves with the 
tyminskis in toronto mrs fox said she had been graciela 
tyminskis confidante and that mrs tyminski told her of alleged 
abuse by her husband fox said he had urged her to seek police aid 
and that a childprotection agency had become involved once 
the information has nothing in common with the truth said 
tyminski campaign spokeswoman agnieska majewska we dont know 
where they got the information from 
tyminski acknowledged knowing the foxes but only slightly mr 
fox visited us two times and i threw him out because he acted in an 
uncultured way he behaved in a very uncatholic way he insulted 
my wife and was thrown out

a pygmy sperm whale discovered stranded on 
a beach in the florida keys is warm and alive inside a specially 
created wetsuit made of the same material worn by scuba divers 
fathom named for the orlando wetsuit manufacturer which created 
and donated its yellow neoprene apparel was discovered nov 26 on 
lignumvitae key and moved to a holding tank at a hotel 
beaching dehydrated the whales sevenfoot 350pound body 
causing liver and kidney damage in its weakened condition the 
whale stopped eating and began to lose weight burning up the 
protective blubbery sheath that keeps it warm 
statistically speaking fathom isnt doing very good at all 
said lynne calero medical director at the dolphin research center 
no stranded whale of her species has survived for more than four 
months in captivity 
but the one thing that gives me real hope is that she is 
alert in tune with her surroundings and navigating her tank very 
well she said and she is accepting the wetsuit nicely 
the whale was transported to a holding tank at a marathon motel 
where it will remain quarantined for more than a month before 
joining other sea mammals at the nearby research center 
staff from the center a member of the nationwide marine mammal 
stranding network have kept a 24hour vigil over the whale 
handfeeding it up to 20 pounds of squid a day to keep it from 
becoming dehydrated again they pump three liters of water into its 
stomach daily 
but the most ingenious way developed to deal with the whales 
ills has been the whale wetsuit designed to maintain the body 
temperature of the warmblooded sea creature the device wraps the 
whale from six inches below its blow hole to just above its 
excretory organs 
if the whale survives and has not suffered any permanent 
disabling physical injury it will be released back into the wild 
calero said

the georgia supreme court upheld a law wednesday 
that makes it a misdemeanor for ku klux klan members to wear masks 
in public ruling the statute does not violate their free speech 
rights 
in a 61 ruling the court said the 1951 law is a legitimate 
expression of the states compelling interest in preventing 
violence and intimidation 
the decision reversed the ruling of a gwinnett county judge who 
dismissed misdemeanor charges against klan member shade miller jr 
after miller was charged with wearing a mask in public 
miller attacking the statute as unconstitutional contended 
that wearing a mask is symbolic speech protected under the first 
amendment he also contended the law was vague and improperly 
broad 
the lower court agreed but the supreme court rejected his 
argument 
public disguise is a particularly effective means of committing 
crimes of violence and intimidation the court said in an opinion 
signed by chief justice harold g clarke 
a nameless faceless figure strikes terror in the human 
heart clarke wrote but remove the mask and the nightmarish 
form is reduced to its true dimensions the face betrays not only 
the identity but also human frailty 
the opinion said passage of the antimask law was preceded by a 
period of harassment intimidation and violence against racial and 
religious minorities carried out by maskwearing klansmen and 
other hate organizations 
these groups operated as vigilantes and were responsible for 
numerous beatings and lynchings clarke said because of the 
masks victims of klan violence were unable to assist law 
enforcement officers in identifying their oppressors 
they were afraid perhaps even to report such incidents in 
case law enforcement officers might have been involved 
the lone dissent on first amendment grounds came from justice 
george t smith 
he found the antimask law unconstitutional because it is a 
contentbased restriction on political speech directed to a 
dissident group in a public forum and is not narrowly tailored to 
serve a compelling state interest 
the law does not restrict miller from appearing in public 
wearing his robe and proclaiming his message but does prevent him 
from concealing his identity 
the statute makes it a misdemeanor to wear in public or on 
private property except with written permission a mask or device 
which hides the persons identity 
the law exempts the wearing of masks in traditional holiday 
costumes safety devices gas masks in emergencies or drills and in 
theatrical productions 
michael hauptman who represented miller claimed a partial 
victory in the courts declaration that the statute applies only 
to maskwearing conduct when the maskwearer knows or reasonably 
should know that the conduct provokes a reasonable apprehension of 
intimidation threats or violence 
hauptman said that may have left the door open for klan members 
to parade and demonstrate while masked 
but the court indicated that any such activity would have to be 
undertaken in a clearly nonthreatening way in order to be deemed 
legal adding 
persons of common intelligence may readily appreciate 
maskwearing conduct that provokes a reasonable apprehension of 
intimidation in a given context 
for example a person wearing a skimask in midwinter would 
not ordinarily warrant alarm but a person wearing a skimask on a 
warm day while entering a bank certainly would 
attorney general michael bowers disputed hauptmans assertion 
that the ruling may leave room for masked demonstrations or 
parades 
if his client wears a mask itll make my day said bowers 
who added that the ruling may be the biggest decision of the 
georgia supreme court in 10 years in terms of beneficial impact on 
the people of this state im proud of the court 
the rev ct vivian chairman of the board of directors of the 
atlantabased center for democratic renewal a civil rights agency 
praised the court for its decision 
by their actions today the supreme court has helped ensure 
that georgians will be free of the threat of anonymous terrorism 
and violence by the bigotry of the ku klux klan

iraq said wednesday that it would not seek 
un humanitarian aid although it claims food and medicine 
shortages arising from un economic sanctions have killed 1400 
children 
iraq says the sanctions are illegal and refuses to recognize the 
legitimacy of the un sanctions committee that could approve such 
humanitarian aid 
iraq charged earlier this week that 1416 children under age 5 
have died because of shortages the baghdad government is the sole 
importer of medicine iraq and its only official source of supply 
a diplomat on the un sanctions committee which oversees the 
embargo imposed on iraq for its conquest of kuwait said wednesday 
that baghdad has filed no formal requests for food and medicine 
with the world body 
iraq has not approached the committee in any way weve heard 
and read statements that theyve publicized but theyve not 
approached the committee directly said the diplomat who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
medicine and food in dire circumstances are exempted from the 
global economic embargo against iraq and occupied kuwait 
but an iraqi un diplomat speaking wednesday on condition of 
anonymity said his embassy will not approach the sanctions 
committee because it does not recognize the legality of security 
council resolution 661 imposing the embargo and setting up the 
committee 
iraq has repudiated all 12 security council resolutions 
condemning its invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
the sanctions committee is the monitor of un member compliance 
with the economic embargo on iraq and occupied kuwait and handles 
requests for exemptions on banned trade 
there was no way to independently confirm how many if any 
iraqi children have died because of shortages 
but western diplomats generally discount reports of acute food 
and medicine shortages saying iraq in recent weeks received more 
than 30 tons of medical supplies alone in exchange for the release 
of foreign hostages 
the diplomats contend that iraq in an effort to break the 
embargo has sought to portray the sanctions as inhumane

the mayor and city council reached agreement 
wednesday on a revised crimefighting package that would be paid 
for in part by a new lottery game just for the city and tax 
increases 
the sixyear 18 billion safe streets safe city program 
called for additional police patrols and funding for education and 
the criminal justice system 
we have had enough of crime enough of bloodshed enough of 
the suffering and the tears which flow in the wake of criminal 
activity said mayor david dinkins at a news conference with city 
council speaker peter vallone and other city officials 
dinkins had been arguing with vallone over how many new police 
the city needs and how to pay for them state assembly and senate 
leaders who would have to approve most new city taxes told both 
men not to bother coming to albany unless they could agree on a 
joint approach 
the mayor said the plan would be forwarded immediately to albany 
for consideration by the state legislature which is currently in a 
special session 
the ball is now in their court dinkins said 
vallone called the package a doable plan and vowed that 
efforts to fight crime would no longer be used as a political 
football 
the compromise plan calls for the hiring of 3462 new police 
officers 644 less than proposed by the mayor in his original 
fouryear plan announced in october 
dinkins said the new plan would add 9744 officers on patrol 
duty by 1994 through the hiring of new officers the elimination of 
some specialized units and the addition of civilians for 
administrative positions 
the city council leadership offered friday what it called its 
last compromise a sixyear 450 million plan calling for 8856 
extra officers for enforcement duty dinkins fouryear plan called 
for 9603 officers on patrol 
part of dinkins package calls for improving the school system by 
means such as better security and enhanced delinquent programs and 
job opportunities 
tuesdays proposal also provided additional money for district 
attorneys legal aid lawyers the correction system and drug 
treatment and several afterschool programs 
if we had had the money in the bank you can be sure that 
todays agreement would have allowed for a program broader in scope 
and more rapid in implementation the mayor said the reduction 
in scale reflects the economic facts of life 
the announcement of the new crime package came at a time when 
the city is attempting to bridge a budget shortfall through 
cutbacks in other city agencies 
dinkins said funding for the proposed plan would come from three 
sources an increase in the property tax rate an extension of the 
citys surcharge on personal income tax beyond its current 
expiration in 1992 and a new lottery game just for the city 
herb berman who chairs the councils finance committee said 
the effect of the property tax increase would be negligible 
berman said in the first year the average homeowner would pay 
about 10 more with that figure growing to about 25 in the 
ensuing years 
officials had no details about the new lottery game except that 
it would be available only in the city and would yield from 50 
million to 120 million each year

elizabeth taylor ignored her exboyfriend in 
court wednesday as their lawyers began selecting a jury to decide a 
multimilliondollar dispute over the rights to her passion 
perfume 
miss taylor walked across the courtroom surrounded by her 
lawyers and made no acknowledgement of former beau henry wynberg 
seated at the opposite end of a table 
a panel of 50 prospective jurors sat with their eyes riveted on 
the actress dressed in purple as the judge explained what the 
trial was all about 
miss taylor won permission earlier in the day to tell jurors 
about wynbergs criminal record after her lawyers said it would 
explain her decision to keep him out of her perfume business 
lawyers for henry wynberg sought to prevent jurors from hearing 
that wynberg who courted miss taylor between her two marriages to 
richard burton once pleaded guilty to statutory rape providing 
drugs to underage high school girls in return for sex and taking 
pornographic photos of young girls 
they called the evidence irrelevant inflammatory and 
prejudicial 
but miss taylors lawyers argued that those issues were crucial 
to proving that she was justified in breaking off her business 
relationship with wynberg because any reputable cosmetics company 
would refuse to deal with wynberg 
superior court judge coleman swart declined to bar the evidence 
wynberg claims he conceived the actress line of passion 
perfume and hes seeking a hefty share of the profits he says he 
created the fragrance under the elizabeth taylor cosmetics inc 
banner 
at stake about 70 million a year in profits 
litigation has produced volumes of depositions and affidavits 
about wynbergs claim that he had a contract with miss taylor for 
exclusive rights to her name and likeness for promotion and sale of 
cosmetics wynberg sued in 1986 for 72 percent of passion 
profits 
court documents show wynbergs twoyear romance with the 
violeteyed actress ended in august 1975 when miss taylor said 
im going back to richard henry ill see you later 
burton and miss taylor remarried in africa and wynberg returned 
to california court records show that a short time later miss 
taylor and wynberg signed the cosmetics agreement in switzerland 
with burton as a witness 
wynberg said he spent years consulting with chemists and 
manufacturers smelling perfumes and looking for the perfect 
bottle 
i wanted sparkling little lights like stars in there and i 
wanted it to look like money feel like money wynberg said 
according to wynberg hen he presented the actress with the 
heartshaped bottle and fragrance in november 1983 miss taylor 
said lets let bygones be bygones henry lets split 5050 on 
the perfume deal 
in a deposition miss taylor denies wynbergs assertion i 
didnt want to do any business with him she said 
miss taylor contends that wynbergs failure to follow through on 
the project violated the contract and made it invalid 
in 1986 she signed with the chesebroughponds inc cosmetics 
company to market passion using her name and likeness it went 
on to be a big seller

anatoly karpov pulled even in the world 
chess championship with a victory wednesday after reigning champion 
garry kasparov resigned on the 40th move of game 17 
i feel very confident now karpov said it was quite clear 
that he was not in good shape 
the two soviet grandmasters are now tied 85 points each with 
the next game scheduled for saturday 
kasparov had gone one point ahead tuesday when he won the 
marathon 16th game after 102 moves played over four days but 
karpov with the white pieces on wednesday evened the match 
the first player to gain 125 points wins the championship and 
17 million of a 3 million purse in the event of a tie kasparov 
retains the title the first 12 games were played in new york 
after forcing kasparovs resignation wednesday karpov said 
it was a very complicated game but i felt i always had the 
advantage 
the game began with a familiar scenario as the two previous 
games in lyon with karpov playing white the opening was a grunfeld 
with an exchange variation as kasparov castled on the eighth move 
but karpov moved his knight into deeper territory on the 10th move 
that caused kasparov almost 30 minutes of reflection before 
countering with a pawn exchange then bringing a knight forward 
each player is allowed 2 hours for his first 40 moves 
karpov wasted his time advantage on the 25th move when he had to 
decide how to capture a black knight he finally did so with a 
bishop 
now both players had less than 30 minutes for 15 moves but the 
game turned in karpovs favor when he advanced a queen and 
established a rook deep in black territory 
kasparov tried to get out of trouble but karpov kept advancing 
karpov even moved a pawn to the seventh rank blocking the black 
queen and attacking a rook 
kasparov gave up two moves later

house democrats on wednesday tossed out two 
senior committee chairmen but a third survived a lastminute 
challenge 
in a secret ballot rep glenn anderson dcalif chairman of 
the public works and transportation committee failed to win 
another term by a tally of 152100 
anderson later was replaced by the secondranking democrat on 
the panel rep robert roe of new jersey who defeated the no 3 
member rep norman mineta of california on a vote of 121107 
rep frank annunzio dill failed by just two votes 127125 
to win another two years as chairman of the committee on house 
administration which runs the house bureaucracy 
to succeed annunzio democrats elected charles rose of north 
carolina the panels thirdranking member who defeated 
secondranking joseph gaydos of pennsylvania on a 15864 vote 
house banking committee chairman henry b gonzalez dtexas was 
the only other committee chairman to face a serious challenge rep 
bruce vento dminn launched a late effort to unseat him but 
gonzalez was reelected 16389 
in the cases of the ousted incumbents there appeared to be no 
national policy dispute the issue was the individuals 
people were talking about effectiveness said rep gary 
ackerman dny 
the votes also reflected the decline of the seniority system in 
the house the large number of democrats who entered the house in 
the postwatergate elections of the 1970s have grown increasingly 
impatient to take over 
even rep morris k udall dariz one of the best known and

reelection as interior committee chairman udall 68 and suffering 
from parkinsons disease plans to retire after the next congres 
but some younger members want him to hand over the reins sooner 
anderson 77 inherited the chairmanship of the public works 
committee two years ago after the death of rep james howard of new 
jersey although he was elected to a full term in the post for the 
101st congress younger members questioned his aggressiveness and 
mineta openly challenged him 
in the case of annunzio 75 lawmakers said privately that he 
had lost control of his committee staff and the panel was not 
responsive to members needs 
gonzalez 74 was in hot water with fellow democrats because he 
made a campaign commercial for his banking committees senior 
republican chalmers wylie of ohio 
other democrats said he was forced to deliver an apologetic 
speech to the caucus but his public statement was bullish 
crediting himself for leading the committee through the 
firestorm of the savings and loan crisis 
the democrats also elected two new chairmen for other 
committees 
rep william d ford dmich gave up his chairmanship of the 
post office and civil service committee to replace the retired 
augustus f hawkins of california as chairman of the education and 
labor committee rep william clay dmo moves up to fords old 
job

the first marine to refuse deployment under 
operation desert shield was granted an administrative discharge 
wednesday marine corps officials announced 
court martial proceedings against the marine jeff paterson 
were dismissed under the agreement in return paterson will halt 
all legal action against the corps stemming from its rejection of 
his request for conscientious objector status said a military 
spokesman and patersons attorney 
paterson had his rank reduced from corporal to lance corporal 
under the agreement 
in another dispute a soldier whose activeduty enlistment was 
extended without his consent because of the persian gulf crisis 
filed suit wednesday against president bush and army officials for 
breach of contract 
the fouryear activeduty tour of spec sebastian correa was to 
have ended nov 24 in early september he was asked if he wanted to 
reenlist he declined two weeks later correa was sent to saudi 
arabia and two weeks after that he learned his tour was extended 
until december 1991 
paterson 22 was accused of violating orders following his 
refusal to board a plane for saudi arabia with his unit aug 29 he 
also was charged with unauthorized absence aug 16 when he failed 
to report for duty 
the marines rejected his request for objector status saying it 
was based on political rather than moral considerations saying 
they thought paterson didnt oppose war in all forms and wasnt 
sincere in his beliefs 
a statement issued wednesday from patersons commanding officer 
at the kaneohe marine corps air station brig gen rl phillips 
said it would be too disruptive and timeconsuming to have officers 
deployed in saudi arabia give depositions in the paterson case 
phillips also said he was satisfied that paterson had ammitted 
guilt in his dismissal request and that all lawsuits would be 
dropped 
patersons attorney eric seitz said the government had 
legal concerns about what the outcome would be the case has been a 
source of publicity and great embarrassment to the military 
correas tour was extended under a military program known as 
stoploss intended to maintain troop strength during operation 
desert shield 
we have researched the law thoroughly and we feel an automatic 
extension can only be enforced when congress has declared war 
or the president has declared a national emergency correas 
attorney ellis rubin said before filing the lawsuit in us 
district court in miami 
defense department spokesman maj doug hart cited a code section 
that overrules all others and specifies that the president can 
suspend laws regarding separation as the basis of the armys 
stoploss program 
rubin said his client has a satisfactory service record and 
isnt seeking to leave the army just to change his status 
correa 24 is an auto mechanic with the 18th aviation brigade 
based at fort bragg nc the lawsuit maintains his services arent 
essential to the success of desert shield 
in two other conscientious objector cases 
pvt alfred edwin esquibel jr who refused to carry a gun to 
saudi arabia was discharged tuesday from the army on grounds of 
fraudulent enlistment said bill harralson army spokesman at fort 
campbell ky he said esquibel committed fraud when he joined the 
army in january 1989 and indicated he was not a conscientious 
objector esquibel later filed for conscientious objector status 
a special courtmartial which carries a lighter sentence than 
a general courtmartial was recommended for a fort riley kan 
soldier who has refused to go to the persian gulf sgt george 
morse was charged with refusing orders to prepare equipment for 
transport to saudi arabia 
morse plays trumpet in the 1st infantry division band but was 
assigned to division headquarters as a military police officer the 
1st infantry was activated nov 8 and morse requested 
conscientious objector status nov 23

improved ground radar designed to prevent 
planes from straying onto the wrong runway was on order at 
detroits airport where two jets crashed on a fogshrouded runway 
this week investigators said wednesday 
it was not certain the new equipment which tracks vehicle and 
aircraft movement on runways would have prevented the accident 
monday that killed eight people said fred farrar a spokesman for 
the federal aviation administration 
the equipment ordered before the collision is to replace 
existing ground radar at 29 airports including detroit over a 
three year period beginning in 1991 he said 
farrar said the new equipment will eliminate a rather serious 
flaw with the existing equipment which cannot see through heavy 
rain 
it gives us a video map of the airport on the radar screen 
robert bartanowicz supervisor of the faan academy in oklahoma 
city said tuesday it can paint runways ramp areas and pickup 
targets such as trucks and aircraft 
investigators continued wednesday to interview crew members and 
witnesses and examining debris 
the accidents cause is still under investigation and a final 
report is not expected for up to a year said alan pollock 
spokesman for the national transportation safety board 
it isnt our business to rush to judgment and it takes nine 
to 12 months to complete a final report pollock said 
twenty four people were injured when their pittsburghbound dc9 
began taxiing down a runway in heavy fog at detroit metropolitan 
airport and was scored by the right wing of a boeing 727 taking off 
in the opposite direction 
both were northwest airlines jetliners 
no one aboard the memphisbound 727 was injured but the impact 
tore loose the dc9s rear engine spilled fuel from both planes 
ignited the smaller planes fuselage 
the dc9 pilot capt william lovelace of phoenix complained he 
was lost in the fog moments before the collision said a transcript 
of a cockpittower conversation obtained by nbc 
federal investigators while refusing to confirm the precise 
conversation between the pilot and an air traffic controller said 
tuesday the dc9 crew had trouble finding its way just before the 
collision 
northwest said lovelace 52 was making his first flight without 
another pilot observing since his return last week from a fiveyear 
medical leave first officer james schifferns 43 of spokane 
wash joined the airline in march northwest said 
john lauber head of the safety board investigation said 
wednesday schifferns insists he told the flight tower just before 
the collision he thought their plane was on an active runway set 
aside for takeoffs 
lovelace told investigators he never heard that comment from 
schifferns and if he had he wouldve gone for the weeds on the 
side of the runway lauber quoted the pilot as saying 
also wednesday a passenger who said he helped others escape 
from the dc9 sued northwest seeking unspecified damages for 
injuries he suffered milio rinnas lawsuit was filed in wayne 
county circuit court 
rinna 60 a united steelworkers union health and safety 
official suffered burns and other injuries to his hands head and 
knees said his attorney william l martens rinna was treated and 
released at a hospital martens said 
northwest airlines spokesman bob gibbons in minneapolis did not 
immediately return a telephone call to his office wednesday seeking 
comment on the lawsuit 
the safety board told congress months ago that planes straying 
onto the wrong runways are among an airports greatest hazards 
through the end of october 220 such incidents were recorded at 
us airports this year the faa said that compares with 223 
recorded for 1989 179 in 1988 and a record 382 in 1987 
at detroit there were 11 such incidents in 1987 nine in 1988 
eight in 1989 and two this year 
in most cases the pilots entered a runway without control tower 
clearance the faa said 
lauber told a us house subcommittee in march the agency spent 
five years studying runway incursions and ways to prevent them 
those accidents that have occurred and the numerous close 
encounters that we hear about two or three times every week 
convince us that we are relying too heavily on perfect human 
performance combined with a bit of luck to assure the safety of 
landing and departing traffic lauber told the panel

us troops arrested a panamanian 
former senior police official wednesday after he escaped from 
prison and seized national police headquarters with his followers 
in what the president called a coup attempt 
former col eduardo herrera and about 50 armed supporters 
surrendered after shots were fired 
a police officer was reported killed and three civilians were 
reported injured during the fray 
herrera and 35 followers were arrested and are being held by 
panamanian authorities for trial vice president ricardo arias 
calderon told reporters he said about 15 supporters escaped before 
they could be taken to a police compound 
herrera himself made a brief getaway after surrendering but 
us troops captured him at a building nearby 
it marked the first challenge to the government of president 
guillermo endara who was installed one day after the united states 
invaded panama on dec 19 1989 and toppled gen antonio manuel 
noriega 
herrera a former noriega associate said his intention was not 
overthrow but to gain more respect and better pay and benefits for 
police 
endara told reporters wednesday night the punishment for all 
the military and civilians who participated in the attempted 
military coup will be exemplary the administration of justice will 
be expedited because the people rightly want it 
the attempted coup has been completely foiled 
the attempt coincided with a call for a 24hour strike by 
panamas 100000 public employees to back demands for higher wages 
more fringe benefits and relaxation of government economic 
austerity measures 
the coordinator of union an umbrella group that includes 
leaders sympathetic to noriega called the walkout 
a telephone survey indicated about 30 percent of the workers 
took part mostly in the capital endara said the government will 
fire the strikers 
he spoke to reporters shortly before meeting a us delegation 
headed by ambassador deane r hinton and brig gen george joulwan 
chief of the us southern command what they talked about was not 
disclosed 
sgt sabino hernandez a police spokesman at santo tomas 
hospital said sgt telemon montero del rosario was dead upon 
arrival there shot in the left side and that armando canto 29 
was treated for a bullet wound in the thigh 
photographer daniel espinoza of the newspaper panama america was 
injured by a blow to the head domingo romero a reporter for 
critica newspaper was also hurt 
herrera was awaiting trial on conspiracy charges when he escaped 
aboard a private helicopter tuesday from prison on nao island in 
the pacific he said wednesday that police force members were on 
that helicopter 
he and his backers took over police headquarters in panama city 
early wednesday after vainly trying to persuade some police units 
to join them 
panamanian troops surrounding the building were joined by us 
soldiers at panamas request the us embassy said 
a southern command news release said about 500 soldiers of a 
joint uspanama task force were involved in assisting the 
national police at the request of the government of panama in 
protecting american and panamanian citizens 
the united states maintains about 12000 troops in panama to 
protect the panama canal until panama takes it over at the end of 
the century 
herrera met us and panamanian officials while holding police 
headquarters then later walked out surrounded by armed supporters 
and by journalists trying to question him 
in the confusion herrera managed to get away in a car but was 
caught soon after 
herrera belonged to noriegas defense forces but had been on 
the outs with noriega who forced him to leave panama by naming him 
ambassador to israel prior to the us invasion

the daily news filed 100000 lawsuits wednesday 
against eight people who face criminal charges of blocking the 
tabloids distribution 
among those sued was joseph martin a truck driver for the new 
york times who allegedly smashed his truck into a news vehicle 
driven by a replacement worker nov 3 
the lawsuit alleged the replacement driver suffered severe 
injuries in a subsequent assault by martin 
theodore kheel spokesman for nine news unions that have been on 
strike for six weeks called the lawsuits unfounded he said the 
unions will challenge them 
this is another of the continuing acts of desperation of a 
newspaper going down the drain with only one possible solution at 
this time which is to stop suing to stop yelling and to sit down 
at the bargaining table and reach fair and equitable agreements 
kheel said 
the eight face criminal charges of blocking the newspapers 
distribution 
earlier the news filed a federal lawsuit alleging racketeering 
by the unions in blocking newspaper distribution it also has filed 
lawsuits against three other people accused of strikerelated 
violence 
john sloan a news vice president would not comment on 
negotiations between management and unions and referred calls to a 
federal mediator 
the first afternoon version of the newspaper in nine years was 
hawked for a second day wednesday management officials said the 
new edition had a 30000copy run but there were no figures on how 
many copies were sold 
hawkers selling the newspaper in the subway wednesday were met 
by striking news employes who handed out boycott leaflets the 
unions have dismissed the new afternoon edition as an act of 
desperation 
the afternoon edition is an effort to regain circulation and 
advertising lost since the strike began oct 25 
the news has published every day but its prestrike weekday 
circulation of 109 million making it the nations third largest 
metropolitan daily has dropped by more than 50 percent 
advertising revenue has plunged the news expects to lose up to 
35 million in this quarter and about 85 million for the year the 
newspaper lost 115 million from 1979 through 1989

the scottish drifter convicted of savagely 
wounding actress theresa saldana in a knife attack eight years ago 
told jurors wednesday he was sorry she didnt die 
unfortunately i wouldve preferred a gun arthur jackson 
said in addition to being more efficient it wouldve been more 
humane i regret very much the extent of her wounds 
jackson 55 said his 10year mission to be executed at san 
quentin suffered a setback when saldana didnt die from the attack 
despite being stabbed repeatedly by jackson with a 5inch knife 
my divine mission is to volunteer as a candidate for supreme 
sacrifice by way of death by shooting or cyanide gas at san 
quentin jackson said 
jackson was convicted of attempted murder and assault with a 
deadly weapon for knifing saldana outside her west hollywood 
apartment in 1982 
he is on trial on five felony counts of sending letters 
containing death threats to saldana while he was in prison if 
convicted jackson faces up to 11 years in prison under a 1986 law 
that bars freeing felons who threaten victims 
jackson was expected to take the stand again thursday 
tuesday saldana testified that jackson vowed to stab her again 
in the letters 
he swore on the ashes of his dead mother and the scars of 
theresa saldana that he would complete his mission of killing me 
she said 
jackson eventually will be turned over to the immigration and 
naturalization service for deportation on charges pending in his 
homeland the charges involve murder committed during a burglary 
before finishing his testimony jackson confessed to the 1960 
murder in london 
he also claimed he was subjected to mind control experiments 
with the us army and was a victim of witchcraft since 
childhood 
miss saldana who starred in the 1980 film raging bull was 
stabbed 10 times and needed a transfusion of 16 pints of blood and 
1000 stitches she was hospitalized 3 months and has had five 
major operations 
jacksons 12year sentence for the knife attack was halved 
because of good behavior he was to be released last april but the 
new charges filed in march kept him in prison 
prosecutors contend jackson sent seven threatening letters in 
1988 from atascadero state hospital many of which referred to an 
89page letter begun in 1982 and finished in 1984 
the letters were sent to a reporter and turned over to a 
producer of the geraldo television show they eventually were 
forwarded to miss saldanas security adviser gavin de becker 
jackson admitted he sent the letters but said the threats were 
not serious and they were never intended to reach the actress 
deputy public defender norman kavan said it would be hard to 
prove that jackson was able to send the threats from his cell he 
also noted that the letters were sent to the reporter and not to 
the actress 
there was no intent to communicate to miss saldana said 
kavan

the transit authority facing a 102 million 
deficit next year proposed a new round of bus and subway service 
cuts wednesday to save an additional 23 million 
the agency proposed a 27 billion operating budget last month 
that called for 185 million in savings by cutting service and 
eliminating 1406 jobs wednesdays proposal brought the total 
savings to 208 million 
some board members at the transit authoritys parent the 
metropolitan transportation authority said they want the budget 
trimmed still more because they want to present the leanest 
possible budget when they request funding from state legislators 
battling a state deficit 
at an mta finance committee meeting transit authority president 
alan kiepper assured board members his staff is working on further 
cuts 
the transit authority foresees a deficit next year of 102 
million caused by falling subsidies from the state and revenues 
reduced by decreased ridership and farebeating 
the proposed savings would come through cuts in bus and subway 
service closing more subway token booths making onboard 
collections and using buses in place of some subway trains in some 
places 
transit authority staffers estimate that 3 percent of the 
systems 35 million daily riders would be affected 
a fare increase from 115 to 125 is also under consideration 
the transit authority budget goes to the mta board for approval 
dec 20 any changes would then go before public hearings in late 
january or early february

radioactive steam escaped from a 
leaky pipe in a reactor at the diablo canyon nuclear power plant 
but posed no threat to the public a utility spokesman said 
wednesday 
the leak occurred in unit 2 along a weld in a pipe that carries 
cooling water between the reactor and a purifying system said brad 
thomas spokesman for pacific gas amp electric co 
workers discovered the leak tuesday during routine work in a 
reactor containment building thomas said none of the 
radioactivity was released into the environment he said 
greg cook spokesman for the nuclear regulatory commission 
described the incident as minor 
its not a highvolume leak it doesnt endanger the reactor 
or the public cook said he said the agency was working with the 
company to determine the cause of the leaks 
usually when youve got several leaks like this in the same 
system its caused by vibration cook said but the company 
has checked for vibration and found nothing unusual 
repairs on the pipe were expected to take a week to 10 days 
officials switched to a backup system to keep the reactor operating 
at 100 percent power 
the plants other reactor unit 1 remained operating at full

columbias astronauts got in twice 
as much stargazing wednesday but remained far behind and nowhere 
near full speed because of problems with the shuttles 150 million 
observatory 
were trying as hard as we can astronautastronomer ron 
parise told ground controllers at the end of his 12hour shift 
parise and astronaut robert parker hampered by a jittery 
instrument pointing system got in 35 percent of the observation 
time planned for their shift seventeen percent was accomplished in 
the crews previous work period and none before that said mission 
scientist ted gull 
although gull could not say when the astro observatory might 
reach peak efficiency he was confident further finetuning would 
increase viewing time the 10day shuttle mission ends tuesday 
were starting to think science and that is what its all 
about gull said 
among wednesdays observations were a white dwarf star a star 
near the end of its life a galaxy thats 41 million light years 
away and is believed to contain a black hole and crab nebula a 
remnant of a supernova that occurred more than 900 years ago 
later astronaut samuel durrance manually focused one telescope 
on a bright quasar 1 billion light years away and held it steady 
for 30 minutes the target the brightest quasar in the sky was a 
prime observation for the johns hopkins university telescope 
sam was the one who was actively guiding the quasar into our 
aperture its his steady hand to which we owe our success with 
this one said arthur davidsen of hopkins we missed this the 
other day because of ips instrument pointing system problems 
the astronauts took time wednesday night to sing happy 
birthday to beverly brand wife of columbia commander vance 
brand and barbara hoffman wife of mission specialist jeffrey 
hoffman 
id like to say to bev that youre very special and ive 
appreciated your support all along just hope youve had a happy 
day a very happy birthday i wont ask how old you are or barbara 
is either brand said 
the national aeronautics and space administration had hoped to 
start making scientific observations with astro late sunday but 
had to delay work because of trouble with the pointing systems 
star trackers 
as astros pointing problem dragged on scientists removed more 
targets from the viewing lineup about 250 celestial sources of 
ultraviolet light and xrays were supposed to have been studied 
including galaxies quasars and a supernova 
the four astronomers aboard columbia manually operated astros 
pointing system for the third straight day wednesday using a 
joystick and keyboard to steer the three ultraviolet telescopes 
toward desired stars when possible the telescopes were aimed 
automatically normally a quicker and more precise method but 
impeded by a bad star tracker 
at one point spacelab mission operations controls john david 
bartoe informed the astronauts that this is by far the most 
stable pointing weve seen so far 
except that the target isnt in the aperture of the 
telescope parise replied 
new software was transmitted wednesday to correct the star 
trackers sensitivity to light and hopefully improve its sighting 
of dim stars 
observations were briefly halted wednesday afternoon when one of 
four small jets in columbias aft failed because of a helium bubble 
in a fuel line while it was out the telescope lenses were covered 
for protection 
there were moments of excitement amid the exasperation 
nasa scientist randy kimble was elated with observations of the 
white dwarf star by the johns hopkins university ultraviolet 
telescope with which he works the star has never been studied 
with such sensitivity or resolution he said 
because the astronauts had to manually operate the system the 
observation lasted only twothirds as long as planned 
morton roberts senior scientist at the national radio astronomy 
observatory in charlottesville va will have to wait until 
columbia returns to earth before he sees pictures of galaxies taken 
by nasas ultraviolet imaging telescope its observations are 
recorded on film that will have to be developed 
its like that wonderful trip you took abroad with the family 
taking pictures of the kids in front of the eiffel tower and the 
pyramids you want to see what it looks like but you have to wait 
until you get home said roberts one of the telescopes 
coinvestigators 
astros xray telescope which has its own pointing system 
began operating wednesday after falling out of alignment late 
tuesday the instrument is managed by computer commands sent from 
goddard space flight center in greenbelt md 
columbias voyage 218 miles above earth is the 38th shuttle 
mission and the first one in five years devoted entirely to 
scientific research the mission was supposed to be in march 1986 
but was delayed by the challenger accident and then shuttle fuel 
leaks

critical senators want secretary of state 
james a baker iii to promise congress a role in any decision to 
attack iraqi troops and to pledge more time for economic sanctions 
to push saddam hussein out of kuwait 
baker appearing today before the senate foreign relations 
committee was unlikely to satisfy all their demands although he 
has promised close consultation with congress the secretary also 
is a strong supporter of the economic curbs approved by the united 
nations security council after iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
but baker has challenged the view that the bush administration 
would need congressional approval to attack iraq under the security 
council resolution approved last week that sets a jan 15 deadline 
for iraq to pull out of kuwait 
and bakers spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said tuesday 
there has always been a question not only in the us 
governments mind but in many other governments minds would 
economic sanctions alone convince saddam hussein to abide by what 
are now 12 united nations resolutions 
equals 
washington ap some top congressional democrats say that if 
war breaks out in the persian gulf lawmakers should consider an 
income tax surcharge to raise the tens of billions of dollars the 
fighting likely would cost 
the idea similar to the surtax that helped finance the vietnam 
war drew a negative response from one white house official and a 
mostly skeptical reaction from several republican congressional 
leaders tuesday 
nonetheless some democrats say a war against iraq would be so 
expensive that it would be a blow to the weakening economy if the 
government was forced to borrow the money 
war is a very expensive proposition said senate budget 
committee chairman james sasser dtenn who was among the first 
to publicly discuss the idea if we go into a war we have to 
find some way to pay for it not to shove these costs onto future 
generations by borrowing

women are twice as likely as men to experience 
depression but a task force of the american psychological 
association said the reason for this difference is not just 
biology 
patterns of thinking physical and sexual abuse poverty and 
unhappy marriages are all woven into a complex tapestry that puts 
women at double the risk for depression said a report released 
today by the apa 
a threeyear study by a committee of experts organized by the 
apa found that at least 7 million american women suffer from 
depression and that most will go untreated often with tragic 
unnecessary losses such as suicide 
women truly are more depressed than men primarily due to their 
experience of being female in our contemporary culture ellen 
mcgrath chairwoman of the national task force on women and 
depression said in a statement prepared for a news conference 
today 
equals 
arlington va ap a new study found 91 percent of nonsmokers 
were regularly exposed to high levels of cigarette smoke 
suggesting that the environmental protection agency has 
underestimated the risk of passive smoking a researcher says 
dr michael cummings of the roswell park cancer institute in 
buffalo ny also said childhood exposure to parents cigarette 
smoke could be a greater risk than an adult nonsmokers exposure to 
a spouses or colleagues smoke 
if that is correct lung cancer could be about to increase among 
nonsmokers of the baby boom generation a result of their parents 
widespread adoption of smoking after world war ii cummings said 
he presented his findings tuesday at a meeting of an epa panel 
considering the merits of the agencys draft passive smoking study 
that concludes that cigarette smoke is a known cause of cancer in 
nonsmokers

they are used to store vital information from medical records

it took suzanne mubarak a year after her 
husband became president to decide what kind of first lady she 
wanted to be then she accepted the challenge of an american 
professor and went into the slums 
for eight years she has worked among her countrys teeming poor 
to bring education and hope to impoverished children mrs mubarak 
describes herself as a handson social worker 
she has done the job largely without fanfare opening schools 
and small libraries obtaining medical supplies and hospitals for 
those without them much of her attention is focused on eradicating 
illiteracy which afflicts more than half the 55 million egyptians 
i go to the most depressed area the most depressed school 
the most depressed hospital but i dont get depressed she said 
when i see whats been done the smiles of the children if 
you can solve the worst case surely the rest will follow 
mrs mubarak calls her slum projects selfhelp people who 
are inspired to help themselves are filled with pride and go on 
from there she said you dont feel like keeping a place clean 
if its walls are falling in 
seated on the lawn of aruba palace a presidential guest house 
she spoke of her goals for egypt and her life as first lady wife 
and mother of two grown sons politics was the only subject 
declared off limits for her first lengthy interview since 1985 
people say im shy but i dont think so she said i 
would say im just a bit timid 
to the outside world and most egyptians mrs mubarak is a 
mystery 
she is not a daily fixture in cairos government newspapers her 
activities seldom were mentioned at all until the late 1980s 
reportedly because she and her husband president hosni mubarak 
wanted it that way 
the president was said to be anxious that his wife not arouse 
resentment among the conservative egyptians as the flamboyant jihan 
sadat had done still mrs mubarak often is compared with her 
predecessor whose husband anwar sadats assassination oct 6 
1981 elevated mubarak from vice president 
they have addressed many of the same problems relating to the 
state of women education overpopulation and poverty 
were both egyptians so if we do things differently its a 
matter of style mrs mubarak said the problems weve tried to 
solve are still with us 
i cant work in big crowds in the limelight she said 
when i cut a ribbon at a school ive been there 20 times before 
improving the building buying the books training the teachers 
talking with the children and visiting parents in their homes its 
a project i created with the help of private donations 
jihan sadat was known as an advocate of womens rights in a 
maledominated region 
in mrs mubaraks view at the moment there are enough laws on 
the books of egypt that give women equal rights but women have to 
know how to use them its a social and educational challenge 
when her husband became president she said it took me one 
full year to find in myself what was right for me as first lady 
born suzanne thabet daughter of an egyptian doctor and a welsh 
nurse sje was 17 when she married capt hosni mubarak an air 
force flight instructor 
he was so handsome said mrs mubarak now 49 he still 
is 
for 10 years she kept to the traditional role of housewife and 
mother to sons alaa and gamal 
it was very difficult because there were so many wars she 
said my husband was always gone i gave my life to the boys 
the day came when both were in school and mrs mubarak asked 
herself what do i do now relatives and friends counseled 
cooking or sewing classes but i hate those things 
she enrolled in american university in cairo in 1977 when her 
husband was vice president she graduated in political science with 
a minor in psychology he was president in 1982 when she earned a 
masters in sociology 
mrs mubarak said a classroon experience changed her life 
we had this moody american psychology professor who was 
working with children in the bulaq slums of cairo she said 
one day he came in and lashed out at us he said he bet wed 
never been in bulaq to see how conditions are for children that we 
only passed by in our mercedeses 
after class mrs mubarak visited him i said if he felt this 
way why didnt he show us how to help the children she said 
he told me go and find your own way 
i took it as a challenge and i did 
she asked officials for a list of the five worst schools in 
bulaq then led a small group of women to each she chose the worst 
of the worst for herself and wrote her masters thesis on how a 
selfhelp program improved it and could do the same for others 
the first lady and her women volunteers now care for 45 
schools and counting but ive moved on to include childrens 
libraries hospitals handicapped centers everything you can 
name 
some of egypts problems are so huge that one person cannot 
solve them she said but being first lady lets her try and rewards 
her when she succeeds 
there is a darker side to the job no privacy no place to 
unwind you dont live your own life 
its a big price you pay

the government is telling the 
estimated 1 million illegal aliens in argentina they can become 
citizens simply by owning up and filling out the proper forms 
the policy of this government aims at integration not 
expulsion said teodoro funes undersecretary for institutional 
affairs in the interior ministry 
we cant take our latin american brothers to the border and 
expel them he added what were looking to do is regularize 
the situation 
unofficial estimates citing government business and community 
sources say the illegals include 340000 paraguayans 300000 
uruguayans 250000 chileans and large groups of bolivians south 
koreans and taiwanese argentinas population is about 33 million 
interior minister julio mera figueroa caused a furor in july by 
saying the government might expel illegal residents 
the government backed off when neighboring countries complained 
but the issuing of visas to asian immigrants was suspended south 
koreans and others were said to be using argentina as a way station 
to the united states and canada 
what happens is the majority of asian immigrants dont want 
to stay in argentina an immigration official said on condition 
of anonymity they want our passports so they can try to enter 
the united states canada and other countries more easily 
diplomats at the south korean and us consulates declined 
comment 
carlos martinez director of the national bureau of immigration 
said the government is not sure how many illegal aliens live in 
argentina 
unlike other countries that demand that tourists have proof of 
economic resources and return travel tickets argentina 
automatically grants permission for residence up to 30 days to 
whoever asks for a visa he said after the fact it is very 
difficult to verify whether these people left or stayed 
more than 150000 illegal aliens became citizens six years ago 
under a special arrangement most of them from brazil and other 
neighboring countries a similar program was conducted in 1974 
argentina has been a traditional refuge for people fleeing 
poverty and political repression 
thousands of chileans and uruguayans entered argentina after 
military coups in their countries in 1973 bolivians and 
paraguayans seek jobs in argentina they cannot find at home 
citizenship requirements are simple in argentina the worlds 
eighth largest country in area and relatively underpopulated 
anyone who can prove he has lived here for two years may apply for 
a national identity card and passport there is no quota 
but many illegal immigrants lack such necessary documents as 
birth certificates marriage licenses or police certifications of 
good conduct and cant afford to obtain them martinez said 
he said the documents are available for as little as 20 each 
through the appropriate consulate but that could mean several 
hundred dollars for a large family 
about 300000 illegal immigrants began the citizenship 
application process but dropped out most of them for lack of 
money martinez said 
he said the government is urging illegal residents to change 
their status because they might be victimized by employers or 
become burdens on the state 
without national identity cards for example workers cannot 
require employers to contribute to retirement and health programs 
martinez said some workers without legal status must accept wages 
lower than those specified in labor contracts 
he said the government will ask the governments of neighboring 
countries to provide the necessary documents to their citizens who 
apply for argentine identity cards and passports 
argentina might be willing to suspend customs duties on imports 
from those countries provided the uncollected duties were used to 
resolve the illegal alien problem he said

scientists call it the ratzelfratzel effect a 
viewer cant figure how to program his videocassette recorder he 
finally jumps up and down on the remote control screaming 
ratzelfratzel ratzelfratzel 
but vcr plusplus although another infrared remote control device 
in a world now full of them could largely eliminate this 
with the device all you have to do is to punch in a coded 
number called a pluscode corresponding to the show you want 
taped 
what it basically does is allow you to program your vcr in one 
step said louise j wannier vice president of marketing for 
gemstar development corp of pasadena calif which makes vcr 
plusplus 
the handheld machine which costs 60 and went on the market 
last month can simultaneously program both cable boxes and 
videocassette players or just the videcassette player if you 
dont have cable 
theres nothing like it out now said stephen a booth 
editorinchief of video review magazine 
there is a wee hitch though 
although the new york times the los angeles times and 
newspapers in 10 other key markets including dallas detroit and 
san francisco now carry the pluscode program numbers in their tv 
listings it wont be a national operation until next summer 
wannier said 
and not all programs are coded she added it depends on the 
publication its their option the only thing that we have 
required is that they cover prime time plus the major categories 
of programs 
the new goodie could prove a boon for computerdense viewers 
surveys by teenagers find 996 percent of all adults in that 
category 
in the cableequipped homes that account for 59 percent of the 
nations tv households the computerdense now must attempt two 
things programming the cable box to turn on a given show at a 
given hour and then the vcr to tape it 
they usually wind up with an hour of the weather channel instead 
of oh say yet another absolutely key episode of twin peaks 
this usually touches off a display of the ratzelfratzel effect 
with the new machine though you just leave the cable box on 
then all youll have to do is punch in the program number 
and vcr plusplus will operate your equipment the whole shooting 
match wannier said 
as with every new tv equipment arrival not all goes smoothly on 
the first try for starters the small daughter of a new vcr plusplus 
purchaser yowled when he turned off bugs bunny recently to program 
his new toy 
and even though the instructions were written for the 
computerdense the purchaser too yowled when his taping efforts 
yielded the weather channel instead of football a similar misfire 
occurred later 
the companys 800 helpline which operates only on weekdays 
was busy busy busy but a call to wannier and a little 
experimentation fixed things 
gemstar has shipped many thousands of units to key retail 
stores and the daks and sharper image directmail companies 
wannier said 
she declined to say how many have been sold so far but its 
already sold out in many place restocking is under way and 
weve had more than 1500 calls a day from all over the country 
since the machine hit the market she said 
its the first product released by gemstar founded in 1986 by 
henry c yuen and daniel kwoh two scientists with doctorates from 
the california institute of technology 
the company expects to have its new video device reaching about 
25 percent of the nations 931 million tv households by 
middecember and to be fully national by early summer wannier 
said 
however in the opinion of video view editor booth its going 
to need tv guide magazine to really make it work because thats 
the big one among publications needed to carry the new systems 
coded numbers 
the pluscodes now appear only in the chicago and denver editions 
of the magazine 
we have no plans beyond those cities at this point said 
roger youman tv guides editor we wanted to get some experience 
with it and see how it goes its a new product and we want to 
see what happens with it 
its clear that there are millions of people out there with 
vcr trouble looking for a quick fix he said this is a 
cleverly designed device and i think it has possibility 
youman called the new machine the best idea ive seen so far 
but whether theyll get people to buy it is another question 
 
elsewhere in television 
town meeting on war postponed peace efforts blamed ted 
koppels nightline which planned a friday town meeting on 
the subject of whether the us should go to war against iraq has 
indefinitely postponed the show abc says the reason recent 
diplomatic efforts by the us and iraq to meet and discuss the 
persian gulf crisis and avoid war the town meeting may be held 
at a more appropriate time when the debate would have more 
impact a spokeswoman for koppels show says

a premier contemporary art collection 
largely out of public view since twice being attacked by vandals 
five years ago is back on display in a new more secure location 
its just great to see people looking at them again said 
dennis anderson curator of the empire state plaza art collection 
the two dozen paintings used to hang in the busy main walkway of 
the plaza a huge state office complex adjacent to the state 
capitol their new home is in an underground lobby of the health 
departments headquarters more than a dozen sculptures in the 
plaza art collection are going on display in another lobby area of 
the same building 
officials say the lobbies will be locked from dusk till dawn and 
are easier for police to monitor than the quartermilelong main 
concourse where the artworks were previously 
the collection includes works by franz kline helen 
frankenthaler robert motherwell mark rothko adolf gottlieb and 
other mainstays of the new york school of abstract expressionist 
painting five sculptures by david smith that have been outside on 
the plaza for two decades have been moved inside 
a 1952 painting by jackson pollock titled no 12 joins the 
collection for the first time it was damaged in a 1962 fire at the 
governors mansion and had hung for years its paint blistered and 
peeling in the office of the manager of the office complex 
the pollock work and the 20 damaged by vandals were 
paintstakingly restored at the williamstown regional art 
conservation laboratory in williamstown mass 
anderson declined to put a value on the collection but in 1987 
the chairman of the commission that oversees the art barnabus 
mchenry estimated its worth at more than 20 million 
the works were purchased by new york state for about 25 
million between 1966 and 1973 the pieces were selected by then 
gov nelson a rockefeller and other experts to adorn the 
granitelined walkways and modernistic cavernous courtyards of 
rockefellers grandiose office complex 
keeping art safe from vandals and thieves is a worry for 
curators everywhere 
there has been a rash of stolen works of art and of 
vandalism said mimi gaudieri executive director of the 
association of art museum directors in new york city i think all 
museums in the country have improved their security measures 
theyve hired more guards and put in better electronic equipment 
in the most recent major instance of vandalism two people 
shouting antiimperialist slogans mutilated paintings by roy 
lichtenstein and james rosenquist at the international contemporary 
art fair in paris on oct 27 the works had an estimated value of 
135 million a small painting by philippe favier was stolen from 
the same exhibit 
anderson and other experts said artwork available for public 
viewing is at risk of being damaged or pilfered whether the works 
are on display in government buildings corporate headquarters or 
private museums 
security breaches happen in museums and they certainly have 
guards in nearly every room anderson said short of locking 
them artworks away from the public which would be the ultimate 
kind of security we have to deal in stages or variables of 
security 
thomas tubbs a spokesman for the state office of general 
services estimates more than 1 mllion people including the 
15000 state employees who work in the complex see the plaza 
artwork each year 
but workers and tourists are not the only ones who gravitate to 
the plaza 
until authorities cracked down a few years ago dozens of 
homeless people congregated nightly in the parking garages and 
maintenance areas beneath the plaza or on the complexs concourse 
level especially during the winter 
in 1985 a mentally disturbed man who believed he was getting 
orders from outer space scribbled messages in french and english on 
a dozen plaza paintings a few months later another disturbed man 
slashed and wrote religious slogans with a felttip marker on eight 
more pieces of art 
of the pieces not damaged by vandals many displayed the bruises 
of being displayed in a public building conservators say the 
artwork was a frequent target of school childrens spitballs hand 
prints and shoe marks had to periodically be cleaned off the few 
wallsize pieces in the collection 
in 1987 a 10000 tapestry disappeared without a trace from a 
plaza wall it has never been recovered 
in its new location the artwork is surrounded by electronic 
sensors and wire railings extending four feet from the walls if a 
persons arm or foot approaches a canvas an alarm will sound 
cameras will allow police to watch those watching the art 
the pieces that were made for specific sites on the concourse 
measuring 50 feet or more long will remain there with electronic 
sensors and camera surveillance for protection

over breakfast nick davis and brooks hansen tried 
to decide whether eton arthur boone was more famous than andy 
warhol 
he may have been about as well known as andy warhol said 
hansen 
davis disagreed oh i think less well known he said 
who was boone actor painter standup comedian 60s icon 
and a work of fiction 
hansen and davis ought to know that better than anyone since 
they collaborated to create the title character of their novel 
boone summit books 1995 which is played out in the new 
york art and performance world of the 1960s 
but during an interview they scattered references to boone 
naturally through their conversation as if he was an old and very 
real friend 
take the comment from davis describing his own new career as an 
actor with an improvisational group in new york every time i 
come off stage i think my god boone was good i cant fill 
boones shoes 
while their friendship with boone is imaginary their 
acquaintance with each other dates back to childhood the two were 
born a month apart in new york in 1965 their families were 
friends and they vacationed together growing up both davis and 
hansen attended harvard university where they began working on 
boone 
although the two are now working separately they still talk and 
act like a writing team straight out of a hollywood movie 
finishing each others sentences picking up on each others ideas 
and jokes their looks and styles complement each other hansen is 
blond and bespectacled and speaks deliberately while davis is 
dark haired and athletic 
hansen and davis familiarity with new yorks art scene is 
something they came by naturally davis grandfather was a 
screenwriter his late mother was an author and his father is the 
documentary film maker peter davis who directed hearts and 
minds the film about the vietnam war hansens mother is an 
artist and his father is a television executive 
their novel is structured around fictional recollections of 
characters who knew boone 
to help develop the wide variety of characters in the book 
davis and hansen asked student actors to play different people in 
the work they gave their fellow students a hint about the 
characters they were supposed to play then took them to a 
farmhouse in connecticut and watched the results 
the more time we spent with those characters the more we 
understood them davis said 
but the improvisational skits didnt offer enough we realized 
it wasnt becoming a very good book said hansen it was flat 
and long 
the pair abandoned the book their senior year and picked it up 
again in the summer of 1987 after graduation they finally hit on 
the solution to boones character while watching sammy davis jr on 
television they suddenly realized boones great talent was going 
to be performing monologues in which he would not only assume the 
identity of a celebrity but delve into that persons soul 
thats when they realized their central character had a dark 
side that boone was mean davis said 
hansen described himself as more the litigator for the plot 
davis he said was a more positive accepting reader 
hansen is now working on a second novel by himself and davis is 
acting in new york 
for now they have no collaborative efforts in the works for 
the sake of yourself youve got to show you can do it yourself 
hansen said

madonnas already done it stings about to join 
her coming soon paula abdul and janet jackson 
is it broadway a movie world tour 
its qsound a new recording technology that turns an ordinary 
set of stereo speakers into a kind of 3d sound system according 
to its developers madonna just released the first album using the 
system while the rest are working with it now 
youll hear things in the songs youve never heard before 
promises shep pettibone who mixed madonnas immaculate 
collection greatest hits package the whole idea is to make 
stereo more stereo to sound even better 
basically the system enhances the stereo effect that makes 
sounds appear to be projected from their source instead of coming 
from the speaker a computer with a special software program is 
attached to regular production equipment during mixing to create 
the effect 
there are just six of the qsound recording systems in the world 
one in new york one in europe two in los angeles and two in 
canada pettibone with frequent visits from madonna worked on 
the one in manhattan 
the result congas popping in from your right ear synths from 
your left ear madonnas vocals coming in and out from either side 
all of it several feet from your speakers 
finally something that compares with the little sounds in my 
head said madonna after hearing the results 
its a long way from the first demo developed to promote the 
project thunder claps and a growling bear that sounded like a 
sick moose said lawrence ryckman president and chief executive 
officer of archer communications icc which is a partner with 
qsounds inventors 
it was quite embarassing but it worked ryckman said of 
those early days 
rocker julian lennon whos planning a qsound recording 
recalled his first exposure to the technology as less than 
inspirational i heard it about a year ago when to put it 
politely it wasnt very good its gotten better with time 
qsound was conceived in 1980 by coinventors dan lowe and john 
lees the project was put off by financial difficulties for several 
years until lowe met with ryckman in late 1985 
ryckman was convinced lowe had something after several years of 
raising money and industry interest they finally brought qsound to 
the fore in the past 18 months in addition to music qsound will 
be used in the 1991 generation of nintendo games ryckman said 
the artists who have sampled qsound are uniformly enthusiastic 
madonnas collection went on sale nov 13 it is already rising on 
the charts 
the process could add to the cost of a tape or cd because 
ryckman said qsound will get a royalty on each record sold just as 
singers and bands do adding to record companies costs however 
madonnas immaculate collection is regularly priced 
lennon became a qsound convert after hearing a demo of the new 
sting album the soul cages he is now writing his next album 
in anticipation of using the system for the whole thing 
the mix i heard for stings new album blew me away totally 
he said after that i said this is for me its an extra 
dimension i always believed there was more out there and weve 
found something 
singer freddie jackson giggled giddily when he took a break from 
using qsound to mix his new single do me again 
i heard the system heard the quality and i was floored by 
it he said i want the music to sound like its live on stage 
thats the exciting thing its like live i think everyone is 
going to be floored by the sound 
hugh padgham who produced the new sting album was more over 
the top qsound will do to stereo what stereo did for mono 
so does this mean qsound is the wave of the future those whove 
used it say for certain things yes for other things no 
the main concern i have is it loses the drive of the song 
said goh gotoda the engineer on jacksons single for certain 
things its very nice freddys vocals for example it gives a 
threedimensional feel but the rhythm section no you want to 
keep that as tight as possible 
pettibone agreed there are limitations i think it would work 
great for albums for 12inch singles i dont see it as necessary 
the only place i dont see it working at all is classical

militarily president bush pledges the 
persian gulf crisis will not become another vietnam but 
politically there is no such assurance 
instead there are parallels 25 years apart between the first 
stirring of congressional skepticism about vietnam and the current 
hearings on us policy against iraq 
it is not just an institutional debate about the powers of 
congress and those of the president behind it is the question of 
national support for bushs course if it leads american forces into 
war against iraq 
more than any other decision in a democracy the decision to 
go to war demands popular understanding and popular assent 
historian arthur schlesinger jr said it is a lesson his 
colleagues in the kennedy and johnson administrations learned in 
bitter vietnam experience 
as the senate armed services and foreign relations committees 
heard testimony on the persian gulf confrontation questions and 
sometimes answers echoed those of a generation ago when the 
vietnam buildup was beginning 
when the possibility of a declaration of war in vietnam was 
raised in 1965 the johnson administration said no on grounds that 
it could trigger a chain reaction in the communist bloc and widen 
what was then a limited war 
now that us forces in the gulf face the possibility of 
conflict after a jan 15 united nations deadline secretary of 
defense dick cheney dealt with the same issue this week in much the 
same way 
the notion of a declaration of war to some extent flies in 
the face of what were trying to accomplish here he said which 
is to try to force iraq to get out of kuwait as an international 
venture under united nations auspices 
im not sure why you would want to have the united states go 
out unilaterally on its own and turn this into an iraqus war 
cheney said 
well because mr secretary thats what the constitution 
provides sen edward m kennedy dmass retorted saying that 
if it comes to combat the fighting will be americans vs iraqis 
at the beginning of the vietnam conflict there was little 
political or public dissent about the declared administration goal 
of helping the south defend against communist aggression from the 
north the antiwar movement took shape slowly as he conflict 
escalated into the longest of americas wars 
but there were early notes of caution and skepticism at hearings 
before the senate foreign relations committee in the winter of 
1966 robert s mcnamara the secretary of defense declined to 
appear there saying it would not be in the public interest for him 
to discuss vietnam policy in open session 
this time mcnamara the vietnam hawk testified on the side of 
caution he told the foreign relations committee on tuesday that 
the united states should wait for economic sanctions to work 
against iraq who can doubt that a year of blockade will be 
cheaper than a week of war he said 
the senate hearings began 10 days ago before the armed services 
committee cheney was invited to lead off but the administration 
decided against an appearance until after the united nations 
security council had approved the possible use of force to drive 
iraq from kuwait 
that left the initial proceedings to former officials and 
retired military men who generally counseled caution questioned 
the wisdom of bushs plan to more than double us troop levels 
and said the united states should wait for un economic sanctions 
to force iraqi withdrawal 
countering them on monday cheney said he believes saddam 
hussein can ride out the sanctions that would leave a military 
offensive as the only way to drive him from kuwait unless he leaves 
peacefully 
that prompted sen john glenn dohio to observe that cheneys 
statements were almost a rebuttal of current policy which was 
built around the embargo cheney denied that 
but the delay in his appearance did put him in the position of 
answering critics instead of stating a case for them to rebut 
from the administration standpoint they probably made a 
mistake said sen albert gore jr dtenn 
while bush said he welcomed the senate hearings he hardly 
sounded enthusiastic theyre talking right now he said last 
friday theyre having endless hearings by endless experts up 
there 
bush said he knew there were fears of another vietnam let me 
assure you should military action be required this will not be 
another vietnam he said this will not be a protracted 
drawnout war 
he said us troops will be backed to the hilt and there will 
not be any murky ending 
but at the hearings sen robert c byrd dwva said hed 
been to the white house as a senate leader in the vietnam era and 
heard overly optimistic estimates of the military outlook there 
history is littered with the bones of optimists and soldiers 
who thought that they were headed for a short war said sen 
william s cohen rmaine

when they check up on the state of their 
finances in these recessionary times many people are paying 
especially close attention to their disasterpreparedness plans 
it is no cheerful business to contemplate in detail what could 
happen to your pocketbook should calamity strike 
but financial advisers say you can wind up saving a lot of money 
and misery if you keep watch for earlywarning signs of trouble and 
have some advance idea however sketchy of how to react to it 
financial trouble gets out of control sooner than most people 
expect says john reed in his newsletter real estate investors 
monthly 
thats because there is a slippery slope to debt the debtor 
is in big trouble when he thinks trouble is still far off 
many precautionary measures are part of the routine job of money 
management maintaining insurance coverage for example and 
saving to store up a reserve of ready cash 
still authorities on the subject say there may be many 
additional benefits to running through the budgetary equivalent of 
a fire drill before the temperature gets uncomfortably hot 
debt problems can happen to anyone at any time cautions 
the american financial services association a lenders trade 
group unforeseen medical expenses a temporary job layoff a 
marital breakup all can play havoc on the most stable of budgets 
for others mismanagement of their personal finances can lead 
to serious trouble in a short period of time the problems can be 
compounded by how people face a budgetbuster crisis 
one common pitfall advisers say is to ignore or deny the 
existence of a problem in its early stages 
as soon as it looks like a payment might be missed creditors 
should be contacted says the american bankers association in a 
current bulletin on the subject 
they may be able to assist by refinancing extending payment 
periods or consolidating loans delaying may only make matters 
worse 
a second source of potential danger can be overly optimistic 
calculations or assumptions about the cushion of assets on which 
your finances rest 
if you have to liquidate stocks mutual funds or other 
fluctuating assets during a spell of economic trouble you may have 
to sell them at distress prices 
that same hazard can apply to the biggest asset in many peoples 
hands a house or other real estate property especially ow when 
real estate markets in many areas of the country are depressed 
if you have to move or need to sell a house just to raise cash 
the proceeds may be greatly diminished by capital gains taxes on 
any profit you realize above your cost basis of the property 
the law allows home sellers to put off paying these taxes if 
they buy another home of equal or greater value within two years 
but if you are in financial difficulty you probably cannot buy 
the requisite home reed points out 
the deeper into trouble realestate investors get he adds the 
more extra costs they may incur including such possibilities as 
lawyers fees late penalties on debt payments and even 
mortgageprepayment penalties 
reeds advice for realestate owners which might well apply to 
many other people as well do an ifwelosecontrol balance 
sheet 
list assets at their netliquidationsale values and add the 
additional liabilities which would be triggered by defaults 
prepayments and taxes he says if the losecontrol balance 
sheet shows a zero or negative number youd better steer well 
clear of losing control 
furthermore take immediate action to improve your 
losecontrol balance sheet

it is difficult to convince someone whose house 
has been on the market for a year at progressively lower prices 
that yes there is still a market out there 
potential buyers are out there say demographers those folks 
who analyze population statistics and make projections from them 
and when the mix of economic elements is right they say those 
buyers may spring into action 
the explanation lies in a further examination of the baby boom 
generation that followed world war ii which some marketing people 
assume has by now made most of its biggest purchases such as cars 
and homes 
but others now say some of that bulge of youngsters hasnt 
completed its purchases especially homes 
the initial impact of boomers had explosive results for housing 
in 1976 the total value of existing homes sold was 966 billion 
four years later the value was 2457 billion 
glenn e crellin an economist with the national association of 
realtors has traced the trail left since then as the boomers 
worked their way through the economy 
the boomers were hurt by the two recessions in the first three 
years of the 1980s but then came back strongly despite the 
recessions more than 303 million units were sold in the decade 
11 percent more than in the 1970s 
prices rose even more the median leaped from 55700 in 1979 to 
93100 in 1989 and in many areas the appreciation was at a rate 
of 20 percent a year for a few years some houses tripled in price 
some even quadrupled 
a consequence of this was that some baby boomers were priced out 
of the market but not permanently some still wait for the proper 
times lower interest rates lower prices and a better economic 
outlook 
thats one part of the potential market but still another tends 
to be overlooked 
in its entirely the baby boom era lasted almost two decades 
from 1946 to 1964 but as crellin points out it came in two 
distinctly different waves 
in the first which lasted 10 years from 1946 to 1955 births 
jumped from about 29 million a year to more than 4 million as 
that part of the boom worked it ways through the economy it was 
easily traced and highly publicized 
the second wave which lasted nine years was not as dramatic 
the number of births no longer rose but it seldom fell either 
births plateaued at a very high level between 41 million and 43 
million a year 
years later the two waves had this effect on housing 
the first produced a sudden rise in household formation which 
often can be equated with housing demand it was very very 
noticeable the second produced no sudden demand but it maintained 
demand at an extremely high level 
some of that potential demand had not been satisfied when 
various economic factors combined to throw housing into a downturn 
some baby boomers had not even come of buying age roughly 26 years 
to 44 years 
thus some of the older boomers deprived of home ownership by 
the economic downturn may become buyers when times improve and 
the youngest of them will be entering the homebuying age group for 
the first time 
it leads crellin to the conclusion that an enormous pent up 
demand from these households for owneroccupied housing still 
exists the message to those seeking to sell therefore is this 
have faith and more patience

conference adopted five different partly inconsistent resolutions 
about language dealing with the deity 
four of the resolutions supported traditional terminology and 
the fifth rejected all efforts to legislate specific addresses to 
god in worship and liturgy the churchs board of discipleship

chef edna lewis has gained a national reputation 
simply for cooking the way everybody used to by tinkering and 
tasting before cooking became opening cans adding water to mixes 
and tearing open microwave packaging 
sure chefs everywhere now insist on the freshest local 
ingredients and many specialize in regional cuisine but while 
these culinary academytrained cooks race from fad to fad remember 
baby vegetables remember quiche lewis has spent most of her 74 
years steadily building a repertoire of southern dishes best 
described as high home cooking 
readers of lewis three cookbooks the edna lewis cookbook 
the taste of country cooking and in pursuit of flavor 
know her devotion to seeking out the old varieties of fruits and 
vegetables cooking by the seasons and keeping preparations simple 
lewis invoked these themes again and again in a recent interview 
that began at a farmers market in manhattans union square where 
she often buys produce for gage amp tollner the landmark brooklyn 
restaurant where she has worked since 1988 
lewis grew up in freetown va a small community settled by 
freed slaves i grew up on the farm everyone was 
selfsufficient she said in her slow and soft manner of 
speaking each family had a garden in the spring you planted 
corn and in the fall you gathered in the crop and during the winter 
you shelled your corn and took it to the mill and they ground it up 
and you took it home the same day 
so when we were shelling the corn we knew it was going to be 
made into our cornmeal when we brought it home from the mill we 
would taste it to see what this corn tasted like that we grew and 
shucked and shelled ourselves sometimes we couldnt take it to 
the water mill and had to take it to the mill that ran by motor 
and we would taste it afterwards and say oh it tastes of the 
motor so we were all involved not so much in the cooking but in 
the taste of things 
such intimate contact with food has given lewis an exquisitely 
sensitive palate she can tell the difference between a chicken 
stock that has boiled and one that has barely simmered she can 
taste a quickbrea and tell if doubleacting baking powder was 
used the word taste pops up everywhere in her speech and in 
her cookbooks 
standing next to a tomato vendor in the market for example she 
explains why she doesnt switch from fresh to canned tomatoes when 
summers over as many cooks do i can taste the can 
lewis who is entirely selftaught as a chef came to new york 
before world war ii and fell in with a group of friends who took 
turns cooking for the others 
as she tells it one of them john nicholson said edna one 
day im going to open a restaurant and youre going to cook for 
it he did and lewis became chef at cafe nicholson in the late 
40s the restaurant attracted tennessee williams truman capote 
and others hankering for real southern cooking 
she later worked at restaurants in north and south carolina and 
ran a pheasant farm in new jersey before returning to new york to 
cater and do other restaurant work her second cookbook the 
taste of country cooking published in 1976 established her as 
an authority on the subject 
in 1988 restaurateur peter aschkenasy bought gage amp tollner a 
fading dowager of a restaurant renovated it and brought in lewis 
to revitalize the menu she introduced country ham panfried 
quail corn pudding and spareribs at the 111yearold seafood and 
chop house and the crowds started returning 
alice waters of chez panisse restaurant in berkeley calif 
called lewis ageless and tireless in her pursuit of the pure 
flavors from her past watercress as peppery as the wild cress she 
used to pick by streams country ham as mellow as the hams that 
came from her brothers hogs buttermilk that hasnt lost its 
richness from processing 
i dont think all chefs have her ability her desire to taste 
and taste and taste again to recognize that these peaches dont 
taste as good as last years because they were picked too soon 
this constant evaluation of everything as it comes waters said 
lewis is a tall regal woman who favors african print dresses 
and tends to answer questions with circuitous stories 
she was interrupted at least a halfdozen times by wellwishers 
who recognized her 
were two transplanted virginians who love your books said 
one man accompanied by his wife i just want to tell you we were 
in smithfield recently and they told us they dont feed peanuts to 
the hogs anymore 
she told the man she would be traveling soon to smithfield va 
famous for its country ham i want to talk to gwaltney co i 
think they have the best ham but theyre not as good as they used 
to be 
after the interview moved to a mcdonalds the only restaurant 
in the area found to be open at the early hour lewis said she is 
working on a new cookbook on traditional southern cooking people 
still eat that way at home she said but its increasingly 
difficult to find that style of cooking in restaurants 
i guess people want to taste outside cooking japanese 
italian whatever she said

when the switch is thrown wednesday on the 
capitol christmas tree it wont be just another lighting to the 
folks of walden colo for four years walden has planned so that 
one of its trees would be the centerpiece of the holiday season 
americas christmas tree

through 28 presidents and half the countrys history it 
survived sprouting from a single seed it grew as the nation did 
from a few scented needles to a 74foot sentry of the forest when 
they cut it down just before thanksgiving the evergreen revealed a 
magnificent trunk girdled by 136 rings 
and now because a handful of people in a depressed logging town 
believed they could do it this noble englemann spruce has emerged 
from deep woods near walden colo to make its way by truck and 
train to the front lawn of the us capitol 
americas christmas tree is ready to light up the season 
wednesday this years capitol tree found its way from the 
coloradowyoming border to the countrys front yard because pat 
bunge proprietress of pats hair hut and retired school teacher 
mary rupp and us forest service specialist carolyn krupp and 
chris christofferson owner of the north park cleaners and laundry 
and other civic bosters had an idea four years ago 
they wanted to do something special to celebrate waldens 
centennial in 1990 
many in the town of 800 people looked around and what they saw 
were trees millions of them trees carpeted hillsides made the 
air smell good built their houses fed their fireplaces and wood 
stoves through long frigid winters and most importantly kept 
their faltering economy alive 
like most other americans the folks of walden had watched 
christmas tree lighting ceremonies on television they were 
confused between the white house christmas tree and the capitol 
tree so they investigated and learned that the white house 
version is a living tree that is redecorated every year 
the capitol tree however is always a freshly cut evergreen 
from a national forest and no public funds ever are used to 
transport or decorate it truly making it a peoples tree 
so in the late winter of 1987 a few folks in walden decided 
they wanted the 11 millionacre routt national forest that 
encircles the town to donate the capitol tree in 1990 
christofferson then a town councilman recalled that nobody had 
thought about celebrating the centennial before a local forest 
service official noted the 100th anniversary was fast approaching 
but we got right on it and sent a letter back to washington 
to the head of the forest service petitioning for the honor 
said christofferson we were competing with four other 
communities and with the help of our congressional delegation we 
got picked then we went to work 
waldens capitol christmas tree committee met monthly it 
commissioned a logo mailed fliers to every school district in the 
state soliciting waterproof fireproof decorations for the tree 
the committee brainstormed ways to raise more money in a town 
that long had been used to making do instead of making new its 
members were a cross section of the community teachers 
businessmen state officials foresters a retired postman even 
the school superintendent it was grassroots and it was effective 
volunteers eventually raised nearly 10000 
corporate sponsors were solicited union pacific railroad agreed 
to transport the tree to washington louisiana pacific donated 
trucks and cranes to get the tree from the forest to the train and 
then move it from a rail siding in washington to the capitol 
anheuserbusch even pledged its famous clydesdales to lead the 
towns christmas parade and give the tree a grand sendoff 
boosters designed and sold souvenir mugs hats and tshirts to 
pay for cutting and wrapping the tree more than 100 people 
including at least 35 kids signed up to go to washington for the 
ceremony bake sales and car washes helped finance their expenses 
before you could say tannenbaum the whole community was 
united in christmas tree mania 
but despite all the hubbub waldenites hung on to the original 
goal find their best tree and give it to the country parents took 
their youngsters for weekend walks scouring the back country for 
pretty trees the committee offered a 50 prize snowmobilers 
ventured far back in the wilderness in winter hoping heavy snow 
would help them find that one perfect evergreen 
foresters kept a confidential list of candidates and by last 
july nine trees were deemed suitable to show paul pinkus 
landscape architect of the capitol when he arrived in walden 
it took us two days to look at all of them because they were 
spread out all over the county but he finally picked the 
nexttolast tree he saw christofferson said 
pinkus supervises 84 employees who manicure the capitol grounds 
and he knows a good sturdy christmas treewhen he sees it 
americas christmas tree must have good color be very full and 
yet compact and be at least 50 feet tall and 25 feet in 
diameter said pinkus 63 who has chosen the tree for 27 years 
a week before the treecutting ceremony kicked off waldens own 
christmas season the national association of counties delivered a 
morale blow by calling the town one of the 10 most endangered 
communities in the west 
but that was old news to walden citizens whove been going 
through tough times so long even oldtimers cant remember the boom 
years they werent about to let the obvious ruin their party 
so on nov 11 a crowd of 500 bundledup wellwishers applauded 
with their mittens sang carols and cheered on 75yearold 
treecutting expert casimier wojakowski of bark river mich as he 
choreographed the felling of the chosen tree 
with hand signals to loggers and intuitive skill wojakowski 
supervised the ceremony in just a few minutes a 4ton behemoth was 
gently lowered to the snowsprinkled ground 
christofferson will be in washington when house speaker tom 
foley dwash throws the switch and sets waldens tree aglow 
some 4000 lights clear amber and blue and 6000 handmade 
ornaments from colorado schoolchildren will set the tree 
atwinkling 
and walden will realize its dream 
its the biggest thing thats ever happened to us 
christofferson said weve really put walden on the map

eastern europe generally turned its 
back on the soviet union after the regions communist rulers bowed 
to popular revolt a year ago but trade and geography make the huge 
neighbor impossible to ignore 
new governments must balance the lingering emotion of revolution 
with economic and political reality 
they rejoice over the departure of soviet soldiers and the 
warsaw pacts impending demise but warily watch the floundering 
giant that supplies most of their oil and much of the electricity 
natural gas and timber and buys their mediocre consumer goods 
some east europeans wonder whether they are trading one form of 
domination for another 
it is well known that hungarys energy supplies are largely 
based on soviet raw materials laszlo lengyel an economist and 
political scientist wrote in the hungarian labor daily nepszava 
there is no need for tanks to maintain their influence in the 
region 
anger and distrust toward the soviet union are evident among 
ordinary people throughout the region 
in bulgaria once the kremlins closest ally in the soviet bloc 
only 30 percent of those polled favored close ties with moscow and 
75 percent were against celebrating nov 7 the soviet unions 
revolution day 
in countries where the study of russian was required for 
generations hardly anyone seems to understand it people are 
learning english and german instead 
statues of lenin have come down and places named for soviet 
heroes and their local cohorts have been rechristened 
andras hegedues of hungary the only living signer of the warsaw 
pact feels eastern europeans always must keep their powerful 
neighbor in mind 
even if the soviet union disintegrates russia its largest 
republic will remain a military power he said 
richard sumann director of czechoslovakias foreign investment 
agency said we must prepare for a situation where the soviet 
republics are independent or more independent 
poland czechoslovakia hungary and romania border the soviet 
union bulgaria is tied to the eastern slavs by language and 
custom 
the soviet union says the close ties of four decades were forged 
by more than soviet military might 
eastern europe is eastern europe and it will exist as eastern 
europe forever said oleg a grinevsky the soviet delegate to 
talks on reducing conventional weapons in europe we have 
historic economic and political ties and it is impossible to 
exclude them from everyday life 
in addition to most of its oil hungary gets about onethird of 
its electricity from the soviet union other eastern european 
countries are equally dependent on the soviets with little 
opportunity to change 
cheap and reliable energy supplies are disappearing along with 
soviet political domination beginning in 1991 the soviets will 
demand the market price in dollars for oil delivered to east 
european countries instead of the much lower prices by complex 
agreements within the comecon economic alliance 
several former soviet bloc nations sought oil supplies from 
iraq then the persian gulf crisis tightened supplies and drove 
prices up eastern european countries have pledged to obey the un 
sanctions on iraq 
soviet oil supplies to czechoslovakia this year will be at least 
18 million barrels short of the 116 million promised poland is 
expected to get only 70 million barrels nearly 20 million less 
than expected 
hungary and romania have reeived less electricity from the 
soviet union than anticipated 
the soviet economy is in such chaos that moscow could not even 
promise supplies of chemicals coal timber cellulose paper 
products and consumer goods said laszlo timar who oversees 
hungarys trade with the soviet union 
their problems and troubles are very big and we cannot rely 
on these problems being solved in a short period timar said 
germany is replacing the soviet union as hungarys main trade 
partner but the soviets are not likely to fall below second or 
third he said 
that is a matter of geography according to timar when hungary 
and the others begin paying the world price for soviet oil the 
soviets probably will prefer them as customers because pipelines 
exist to deliver it 
when hungary imposed stiff gasoline price increases in october 
taxi drivers and truckers blocked roads for a weekend virtually 
shutting down the country the government struck a deal with the 
protesters after threatening police or military action 
hegedues who was premier of hungary at the time of the 1956 
uprising against stalinism said he felt civil war was in the 
air during the price protests 
gasoline price increases in czechoslovakia set off two rounds of 
hoarding this year 
czechoslovak officials used looser rules within the soviet union 
to augment their oil supply they cut through the moscow 
bureaucracy to swap trucks buses bulldozers cranes and consumer 
goods for 35 million barrels of oil from the tyumen region of 
siberia 
timar said hungary was close to an agreement to trade its ikarus 
buses for oil 
the soviet union is a huge hungry market for machinery 
manufactured items and consumer goods produced in eastern europe 
beginning jan 1 that trade also will be conducted primarily in 
hard currency 
many of the products cannot be sold in the west but east 
european countries need to earn convertible currency from them 
timar estimated hungary will lose 20 to 40 percent of its soviet 
business next year including half of its machinery market because 
soviet customers will be freer to buy from the west 
he predicted hungary will remain a major supplier to the soviet 
union because our products are well known there we think that 
slowly slowly our exports will be increased but they will be 
tragically cut back for the time being 
even though hungarians look west business will draw them east 
he said there is more personal interest in the west now but to 
make money they will travel to moscow

are a common sight in lima 
couples wait for years in the united states said an 
american lawyer who specializes in adoptions in lima peru is 
faster 
abortions family planning and a more organized welfare system 
in the united states turn adoptions into a fiveyear process most 
adoptions also involve older children 
during an interview in the american lawyers office the 
telephone rang every few minutes with calls from new clients 
perus appeal has soared since other countries such as colombia 
made adoptions more difficult 
phillip is one of thousands of babies offered for adoption by 
poor single peruvian mothers who are unable to feed or educate 
them 
this povertystricken andean nation of 22 million mired in its 
worst economic crisis has discovered it has something many people 
in other countries want babies 
cuanto an economics magazine observed tongueincheek that 
peru could pay its 20 billion foreign debt by selling 13 million 
babies for adoption abroad 
newspapers and television stations noting the growing presence 
of foreign couples have begun dedicating more space to baby 
trafficking scandals 
they reported that an unmarried woman in lima tried to sell her 
three children to an italian couple for 10000 but the father 
halted the deal 
another woman who left her 6monthold daughter with a friend 
for several weeks said in a television interview the friend handed 
the baby over to a european couple 
foreign couples who begin caring for the babies before they are 
awarded custody frequently find themselves caught up in 
complicated legal proceedings critics attribute some lengthy 
adoption cases to court officials seeking bribes 
the american lawyer who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the process is sometimes slowed by a sense of national shame that 
the country cant support its own children 
terry shaffer 30 and single left her home in ellicott city 
md four months ago to adopt a child in peru since then she has 
lost her job as an epidemiologist and is being supported by her 
parents 
her adopted child phillip is from ayacucho a remote 
mountainous region ravaged by a leftist insurgency 
ms shaffer had to face formidable paperwork before the adoption 
process even began documents certifying her birth and mental and 
physical health copies of her passport and tax returns letters of 
reference and employment even fbi assurance that she had no 
criminal record 
all of it had be translated into spanish and notarized 
i gave in everything but the case took so long we got bogged 
down so the judge threw the case out and we started all over 
again ms shaffer said 
linda carey of laurel md had an easier time 
ms carey in her 40s and single took two months to do the 
paperwork she now has her 5monthold daughter johanna elizabeth 
from a poor family in perus rural north 
before a child can be taken to the united states consular 
officials in peru examine the papers to make sure the adoption is 
legal 
the american lawyer said a successful adoption in peru depends 
on the right combination of judge lawyer and biological mother 
well picked they can make the adoption a happy loving 
experience he said badly chosen they can make it the most 
emotionally distressing experience youve ever had in your life 
he said lawyers fees for adoption cases average 60009000 
a lot of that goes on wining and dining the judge and bringing 
the natural mother to lima all medical expenses paid he said 
two years ago american missionaries ed and pam baumgartner who 
have lived in peru eight years took in four battered children from 
a broken home in pucallpa a jungle town 
when the children of four different fathers said they wanted 
to stay with the americans the baumgartners applied for adoption 
that was nine months ago 
what delayed things is that we refused to bribe a single 
official mrs baumgartner said now the fathers are 
threatening to show up im dreading that theyre going to want 
money

if war comes to iraq it also comes to whats 
below the surface there the civilizations of mesopotamia the 
cities of babylon and ur ancient places where humanity learned to 
write to raise wheat and barley domesticate animals and live in 
cities 
but archaeologists are surprisingly sanguine about the safety of 
artifacts buried under the sands in iraqs vast desert 
thousands of unexcavated sites and millions of clay tablets 
whose writings have yet to be interpreted will survive even if 
iraq and kuwait turn into a battleground these scientists say 
obviously if war comes there will be unexpected damage but 
i dont think it will be calamitous with regard to archaeological 
sites except those near modern cities or other potential targets 
said robert mcc adams secretary of the smithsonian institution 
and an eminent archaeologist known for his years of research in 
mesopotamias ruins 
among the potential targets however is the city of ur built 
on the banks of the euphrates at the dawn of history and said to be 
the birthplace of abraham the biblical patriarch 
what sits atop of ur now is a major iraqi airfield almost 
certain to be targeted in a war 
and the fabled city of babylon dating back to 3000 bc is 
just north of modern hilla an industrial city a stray bomb 
intended for hilla could shatter babylonian artifacts 
like most sites in iraq these two retain their secrets despite 
150 years of research only a fraction of what is to be found has 
been uncovered adams said 
we probably have some knowledge other than having walked over 
the surface of less than 1 percent and it may be onetenth of 1 
percent of the existing sites he said i myself must have 
mapped 5000 mounds or something in that neighborhood 
so the treasures there to be unearthed over thousands of years 
to come are enormous 
the prospect of war and of islamic hostility to westerners 
raises doubts about the future of work in jordan syria and 
elsewhere in the region the iraniraq war and the iranian 
revolution of the ayatollah khomeini halted research in iran 
the threat of war raises greater concern about the safety of 
antiquities stored in such places as the spectacular museum in 
baghdad according to archaeologist elizabeth stone of the state 
university of new york at stony brook 
a direct hit would be catastrophic she said 
stone is optimistic however she noted that on three occasions 
during the iraniraq war when it seemed likely that baghdad would 
be bombed iraqi president saddam hussein had priceless objects 
moved out of harms way 
saddam who sometimes portrays himself as a latterday 
nebuchadnezzar the 6th century bc babylonian ruler is well 
aware of the value of antiquities in fostering a timedepth in 
the consciousness of the people said guy van beek a smithsonian 
archaeologist who has worked in the mideast for nearly three 
decades 
van beek said saddam has been extraordinarily active in 
encouraging excavations even given all his problems with war with 
iran 
it is always possible that a pitched battle can take place on 
a site or that a general can decide an excavation would be a good 
place from which to stage an ambush he said 
but short of those quirky events he said most archaeological 
sites are far from cities or targets and unlikely to be in danger 
of wartime destruction the vast majority are 30 40 or 50 feet 
below the surface 
peacetime economic development the flooding of a valley or 
damming of a river is generally more destructive to archaeology 
than war van beek said 
and in wartime he said random bombing is likely to be less 
destructive than the loss or looting of equipment and records and 
the destruction of artifacts that already have been brought to the 
surface 
war of course brings the frustration of disrupting work that 
may have finally begun to pay off after decades of digging 
archaeologists sometimes wait in vain for decades to return to a 
former worksite rather than starting anew elsewhere he said 
when saddam seized kuwait aug 2 no western archaeologists were 
known to have been stranded work had stopped during the hot 
summer 
before the invasion stone was able to put in only three seasons 
of work at the lost city of mashkanshapir which she and 
colleagues discovered in iraq some 3700 years ago she said it 
was one of the worlds 10 most important cities 
now she has no idea when she will be able to resume digging 
we were just beginning to get a real understanding of the way 
in which those cities worked she said

having won control of southern baptist national operations 
fundamentalist forces are concentrating on holding state and local 
organizations in line and seem largely to be succeeding 
resistance has come from some quarters notably denominational 
colleges 
but as the autumn chain of annual state conventions unfolded 
potential revolts against the denominations cooperative 
program for financing national agencies mostly failed to 
materialize 
state allocations to the national budgets remained generally 
intact or increased in some cases with only three states 
modifying their pattern of support two of them only slightly 
the 149 millionmember denomination the countrys largest 
protestant body has churches in all 50 states some with joint 
regional conventions 
basic national budgets for the various evangelistic missionary 
and educational agencies amount to 137 million but supplementary 
revenues push the total to about 400 million 
leaders of moderates pushed to the sidelines of denominational 
management through appointive powers of successively elected 
fundamentalist presidents met in august and initiated plans for 
selective giving 
such alternatives also were sanctioned by the big womens 
missionary union 
but just one state convention virginia radically curtailed 
giving to the central budget cutting its part by half and 
designating the other half to approved causes mainly missions 
special allocations also went to the baptist joint committee on 
public affairs a washingtonbased interbaptist agency virtually 
stripped from denominational support and also to a newly formed 
news service 
the service associated baptist press was set up this fall 
after national officers fired top journalists of the denominational 
agency baptist press 
the marylanddelaware convention also provided direct financing 
to the joint committee on public affairs but otherwise continued 
its regular giving pattern to the headquarters budget 
similar but unsuccessful efforts to finance the committee were 
made in new england missouri tennessee kentucky and hawaii in 
north carolina an alternative finance plan like virginias was 
narrowly defeated 
however individual congregations still may participate in 
alternative finance arrangements how many of the denominations 
37785 congregations will do so remains uncertain 
several of the state conventions drew unusually large turnouts 
as the conflict shifted to that level strains emerged over 
relationships with some baptist colleges 
they apparently sought to stave off the kind of new restrictions 
that already have struck at national levels including the 
denominations main seminary in louisville ky where exacting 
views of the bible were made guidelines for evaluating professors 
the guidelines demand various specific beliefs such as that 
adam and eve were real people and that recounted miracles happened 
as events in history 
differing from the national supervision of agencies and 
seminaries more than 50 baptist colleges come under oversight of 
state conventions 
citing fear of a fundamentalist takeover the largest 
baptist college baylor university in waco texas and furman 
university in greenville sc have made their trustees 
selfperpetuating they previously were named by state conventions 
both cases produced convention controversy study committees and 
hints of lawsuits 
in florida stetson university also moved to distance itself 
from the state convention through a negotiated arrangement in 
oklahoma the convention acted to reinforce ties with oklahoma 
baptist university in shawnee 
in the denominations upper echelons repercussions of the 
fundamenalist ascendancy also continued 
disciplinary action was taken against the rev lee porter of the 
nashville tenn headquarters who was accused of making 
critical interpretations about the 12year controversy in which 
fundamentalists have gained dominant power 
he was removed as design editor of adult sunday school lesson 
materials and assigned to a noneditorial position although he 
wrote a letter of apology to the administration about his 
unspecified comments 
porter also reportedly was being pressured to give up his post 
as convention registration secretary a post he has held since 1977 
and to which he was reelected last june 
a catalyzing center of the fundamentalist upsurge the 
denominations largest church first baptist in dallas elected a 
new fundamentalistbacking pastor the rev joel gregory to 
succeed the rev wa criswell 
calling himself a defender of the inerrancy of the word of 
god gregory told reporters after his selection last week i 
was country before country was cool 
criswell 81 who has headed the 27000member downtown 
congregation for the past 46 years will become senior pastor a 
largely honorary position on jan 6 
gregory who for five years has been pastor of travis avenue 
baptist church in fort worth also was named speaker on the 
baptist hour a nationally distributed southern baptist radio 
program it marks its 50th anniversary of broadcasting in 1991

vincent van goghs creative compulsions brought 
little financial or emotional solace to the troubled dutch 
impressionist during his lifetime but 100 years later he is 
unarguably the worlds most popular painter 
he enjoyed considerable acclaim among his fellow artists during 
the late1800s and his influence was felt long after his death in 
1890 however experts disagree whether he sold only one work or 
three or more during his life today though his works fetch 
astronomical and record prices at art auctions around the world 
a fourmonth extravaganza earlier this year in the netherlands 
commemorated the centennial of the painters death with about 380 
paintings and drawings on show at the vincent van gogh museum in 
amsterdam and the kroellermueller museum in otterlo and a film 
festival and opera 
now comes robert altmans passionate portrait of the artist in 
hemdale films vincent and theo it is a thoughtful inspired 
explosion of the emotions fears and genius of the man who once 
said that work distracts me infinitely better than anything 
else 
tim roth a world apart the cook the thief his wife and 
her lover gives an intensely intelligent portrayal of the 
artist he rides the emotions well without slipping into 
caricature paul rhys litte dorrit lion heart costars 
theo 
it is the not the first time the film world has tackled the 
complex life and personality of van gogh 
altmans is a psychological vignette rather than a fullfleshed 
cinemagraphic biography focusing on the special relationship the 
artist had with his brother theo an art dealer who nurtured 
vincent all his life it is quite unlike vincente minnellis 
sprawling but inaccurate 1956 vision lust for life with kirk 
douglas as van gogh and anthony quinn as his onetime lover 
colleague and friend paul gauguin 
japanese filmmaker akira kurosawa also captures van gogh in the 
crows segment of his movie akira kurosawas dreams it is a 
tribute to the artist who is portrayed by american director martin 
scorsese 
dreams has eight segments and the central character 
throughout is called i in crows i is a grown man a young 
photographer looking at some of van goghs work he eventually 
finds himself in an open field with the artist who proclaims 
all of nature has its own beauty as he furiously fills page 
after page 
van goghs most prolific period was 188889 when he painted 
about 200 oils and did 100 drawings from this passionate frenzy 
emerged some of the most popular art works ever van goghs 
vibrantly colored sunflowers fishing boats and pastoral scenes 
during that same period in provence he wrote about 200 letters 
to his brother his sister gauguin and other artists 
in a letter to theo on april 9 1888 he talks about one of his 
favorite orchards on the outskirts of arles one he ultimately used 
for a painting 
i have another orchard as good as the pink peach trees 
apricot trees of a very pale pink at the moment i am working on 
some plum trees yellowishwhite with thousands of black branches 
i am using a tremendous lot of colours and canvases but all the 
same i hope it isnt a waste of money 
van gogh was born on march 30 1853 in the southern netherlands 
village of zundert life was a continual nightmare of poverty 
loneliness and periodic bouts of madness until he ended it after 
firing a rifle into his chest on july 29 1890 
he rode an emotional rollercoaster between and during his 
prolific outpouring of art after he mutilated himself by cutting 
off his right ear he turned evangelical saying the bible had 
ordered him to remove the ofending organ 
on may 8 1889 van gogh went to the asylum of 
saintpauldemausole in saintremydeprovence a few miles north 
of arles the doctor there wrote in the medical register that van 
gogh was suffering from acute mania with hallucinations of sight 
and hearing 
the first canvas van gogh did at saintremy was irises a 
dancing field of brilliant violet flowers and a single white one 
irises set a record when sothebys sold it for 5390 million 
on nov 11 1987 the painting subsequently was sold to the getty 
museum in malibu calif after australian tycoon alan bond could 
not repay a loan sothebys had posted for the sale 
the most expensive painting ever was van goghs portrait of 
dr gachet which sold this year for 825 million the painting 
in vivid blues and intense orange was of the artists friend a 
doctor who practiced homeopathic medicine 
but it was the starry night that emerged as a cult favorite 
inspiring a song from pop artist don mclean 
the sky is bluegreen the water is royal blue the soil is 
mauve van gogh said in a letter to theo describing the painting 
on the bluegreen field of the sky the great bear sparkling 
green and pink a reflection whose modest shine contrasts with the 
powerful gold of the gas light

armed with healthy skepticism of 
the praise being heaped upon him actor tim roth is as rare and 
refreshing a presence in southern california as is clean air 
the irreverent roth who plays a fiery vincent van gogh in 
robert altmans vincent and theo is dressed in a tshirt that 
proclaims him well red he recounts how he was thrown out of a 
bar at his new york hotel because he was improperly dressed and 
how he needed to borrow a suit for an east coast screening of 
vincent and theo 
hes got a rich swagger doesnt he the 29yearold british 
actor says as another movieland power player wanders by the pool at 
the sunset marquis hotel when a small plane flies overhead he 
remarks oh look theyre bringing the drugs in 
although the skinny sandyhaired roth doesnt much look like 
van gogh he became the character altman said 
hes as good a film actor as ive ever worked with said 
altman who has directed warren beatty robert duvall keith 
carradine and tom conti among others 
roth shares top billing too in tom stoppards film adaptation 
of his play rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead a 
grandprize winner at the venice film festival rosencrantz 
premieres early next year 
while hes not without an ego altman says roth can be difficult 
on the set roth is uncomfortable accepting praise for his work 
although he wants to be a part of the american film scene hes 
hardly in awe of the local industry or himself 
it gets silly the lightly freckled actor said im 
compared to al pacino and dustin hoffman what does it mean i 
just think its safe journalism 
i treat it all with a large bucket of salt theres no 
guarantee of any of this you come here and people treat you with 
kid gloves very nicely and then they forget about you because the 
next person is in town its a cutthroat business and has nothing 
to do with art at all 
art at least has much to do with vincent and theo the 
intense film chronicles the emotional interdependence of the dutch 
artist and his younger brother theo paul rhys an art dealer 
roths vincent has caked and rotten teeth filthy hands and a 
mind thats equally polluted he jams his pipe into his mouth as 
though hes burying a fence post and paints and sketches with 
similar abandon 
although everybody knows something about vincent van gogh no 
ear lobe liked sunflowers had a beard roth says the artists 
life is mysterious and theres not much point doing a lot of 
research either 
i read his letters and looked at the paintings thats it 
said roth a former art student himself 
there are thousands of books you could read but theyre all 
written by academics and intellectuals its a tricky one everyone 
wants him to have been mad and i dont know that he really was 
would you lock him up today what would be the attitude today tell 
him not to be naughty and put him on welfare take away his 
government funding 
as an actor roth has had his share of rejection but obviously 
far less than van gogh 
he did believe and carried on being rejected and thats the 
selfabuse thing eating paint drinking turpentine and cutting off 
his ear lobe thats all part of the rejection 
the only thing as an actor that you are aware of and 
certainly not to the extent that he was is the rejection you are 
aware of being rejected either when youve done something bad by 
the audience or by people who when you think you can do a part 
say no 
roths film credits include the cook the thief his wife amp 
her lover in which he plays a sidekick to a thug and a world 
apart his next film is backsliding an australian drama 
directed by firsttimer simon target 
roth also starred as the transmogrified son in director steven 
berkoffs london stage production of franz kafkas 
metamorphosis 
in working with altman who often improvises and puts a lot of 
trust in his actors roth was free to fashion much of the film 
himself 
if we said this is the way we want to do it altman says 
thats how well do it roth said wed rewrite scenes in the 
evening with him or on our own and then go and present them to 
him 
the script was the starting point for example theres a 
scene where im cooking with paul gauguin wladimir yordanoff 
and it was originally a scene where were sitting around talking 
about painting thats not what painters do with their lives 
that came out when i said lets do a scene where were all 
cooking and wladimir said oh yeah i got a great recipe from 
my grandmother for salads and that was how it came out 
van gogh roth said was someone who had interested him since he 
was in art school he was my fathers hero my father used to 
paint and draw and was also a journalist he had a rough life 
too

larry hagman tells barbara eden on cbs 
dallas that she looks familiar an inside joke for viewers who 
saw them 20 years ago on i dream of jeannie 
for five weeks beginning friday night the primetime soap opera 
brings them into a fractious relationship as miss eden appears in 
the role of leann de la vega 
leanns a very sharp businesswoman who took over running an 
oil company eight years ago after her husbands death miss eden 
said she knows jr because they went to college together 
i cant say too much about the story lets just say that he 
wasnt very nice to her in college and their paths cross again in a 
business deal she decides to extract every drop of blood she can 
get from him 
on i dream of jeannie hagman played tony nelson an 
astronaut who lands on a desert island when his mission is aborted 
he finds an old bottle inside jeannie a genie whod been in the 
bottle for 2000 years 
when he set her free he became her master the show was on five 
years and at the end the characters married 
that killed the series miss eden said i objected to the 
marriage because i knew it would hurt the show it was a fantasy 
it was all smoke she wasnt real to marry her was to turn it into 
an ordinary sitcom 
there also was an animated version on cbs on saturday mornings 
from 1973 to 1975 
cbs and the producers of dallas are hoping the hagmaneden 
reunion will renew interest in the show which has been doing only 
soso in the ratings in recent years on the strength of the who 
shot jr phenomenon a decade ago dallas became a runaway 
hit and had remained at the top for several years 
of her character of dallas miss eden said this woman is 
deadly serious shes nothing like jeannie she makes a plan and 
carries it out jr doesnt remember her which makes it fun 
i had a great time doing this we didnt need any inside 
jokes but so many of the lines are wonderful he asks her 
havent we met before the first day on the stage everyone was 
watching us larry looked at me and said isnt this the strangest 
thing its like weve never stopped working together 
its not their first time together since i dream of jeannie 
however they played husband and wife in a 1971 murder mystery 
called a howling in the woods 
in 1985 she starred in the movie i dream of jeannie 15 
years later wayne rogers played tony but bill daly and hayden 
rorke reprised their original roles 
if dallas returns for another season miss eden might be 
back for another bout with hagman well at least they didnt 
kill me she said 
miss eden starred in the series harper valley pta in 
198182 but has spent most of her postjeannie time working in 
tv movies and regional theater 
she has her own deal for a series and several movies and has 
several series in development including a comedy and several 
onehour dramas 
whatever is chosen will be predicated by the needs of the 
network she said 
miss eden started work after thanksgiving on a psychological 
thriller movie called smithereens based on a book by bw 
battlin 
my husband is murdered and im accused of killing him she 
said they cant make the charges stick its very suspenseful 
because the person who killed my husband wants to kill me and my 
daughter 
im being stalked by angie dickinson the audience knows it 
but i dont she impersonates me which is why they think i did 
it 
earlier this season miss eden was in the nbc movie running 
mates and next year will be in naked ambition a cbs movie 
with a plotline that can be compared to all about eve 
miss eden plays an established anchorwoman who welcomes a 
younger newswoman played by heather locklear

in my back miss eden said shes out to get my job anybodys

it was such a slow news day when he began as the 
new president of cable news network tom johnson recalls that 
cnn was televising stories on mules diving into pools of water 
that was on aug 1 when he reported for duty with a number of 
projects in mind they included an effort to get bill moyers his 
white house boss during the johnson administration to move from 
pbs to cnn 
but all that was put on hold the next day when iraq invaded 
kuwait cnn and its rivals scrambled to cover the persian gulf 
crisis and a possible war 
a month later cnn had its own crisis 
we found ourselves no longer simply reporting on budget 
deficits but experiencing our own as a result of the massive 
expenses of the gulf crisis coverage and a softening advertising 
market johnson said 
and last month there was another crisis which began when a 
federal judge barred cnn from airing tapes of jailhouse phone calls 
by ousted panamanian leader manuel noriega 
though the supreme court refused to hear cnns argument that the 
ban was unconstitutional prior restraint of the press the judge in 
the noriega case later lifted it 
it was a very busy four months said johnson understating 
the case 
it surprised many in the industry when cnns owner ted turner 
went outside both the company and broadcast news to hire johnson 
who then was publisher of the los angeles times 
we really wanted someone that had a lot of management 
experience and had a good reputation as a strong peopleperson as 
well as strong journalistic credentials turner said 
it was the second time in two years a major network had chosen a 
newspaperman to run its news division in 1988 nbc hired michael 
g gartner then head of the des moines register and tribune co 
how great a transition is it from print to television news 
it totally depends on the person gartner said i dont 
think you can generalize 
i dont think theres a great deal of difference in terms of 
the principles said moyers who before working at pbs and cbs 
was publisher of newsday on long island ny 
the principles are remember youre in the news business find 
the best people and give them a chance to do their work in an 
atmosphere of freedom and creativity 
but moyers said his longtime friend is really on the front 
line now in a way that he wasnt at the times because as 
publisher he had a phalanx of people reporting to him while 
thats also true at cnn hes making on a daily basis the kind of 
decisions an editor makes every day i think hes now in a job 
more like patton than eisenhower 
the intensity of the place surprised me perhaps it shouldnt 
have said johnson who for three years was a top executive in 
lyndon johnsons texas broadcast operations but who has spent the 
bulk of his career in print journalism 
cnn was ridiculed by rivals as chicken noodle news when it 
began in 1980 no more it now is an influential worldwide tv news 
organization seen in 100 countries with president bush and iraqs 
saddam hussein among its betterknown viewers 
plugged into 57 million us homes and offices by cable it also 
has 227 tv station affiliates who can excerpt cnn stories for their 
newscasts 
significantly 130 of the stations also are affiliates of abc 
cbs or nbc whose news divisions are caught in the same advertising 
and money crunch as cnn and have pinkslipped some employees to cut 
costs 
but there have been no layoffs among cnns worldwide workforce 
of 1700 johnson said and none are planned 
despite the cost crunch cnn is very healthy economically 
he said although the slowdown in advertising and costs of the 
gulf coverage required that i implement a number of holddowns 
that included the axing of east meets west a weekly 
halfhour series on asian lifestyles and business customs 
if the nations economic slump and the gulf crisis continues 
then i probably would need to find other ways to contain costs 
while doing that which is essential for cnn to do johnson said 
but we will provide comprehensive news throughout all of this 
this is a period of time when i think our audience is more 
interested in the news than ever before 
the financial crunch has prompted johnson to temporarily shelve 
what he calls several initatives or ideas for new programs 
one is a series similar to abcs nightline there has been 
speculation within cnn that it might evolve from cnns nightly 
crisis in the gulf broadcasts just as nightline evolved 
from abcs latenight reports on the iran hostage crisis in 1979 
johnson also would like to start a series about the print and 
electronic media 
and i would like to see us expand our international bureaus in 
africa central and south america and asia three places where i 
feel more coverage would be useful he said cnn now has 14

american telephone amp telegraph co has given 
potential customers another three months to take advantage of a 
freeforlife membership in its universal card one of the fastest 
growing credit cards 
the move announced tuesday by the telephone giant to increase 
circulation of the card was bound to further rankle banks which 
view atampt as an invader chipping away at one of their most 
profitable areas creditcard income 
eight months ago atampt launched the card a visa or mastercard 
that doubles as a longdistance calling card to attract members 
atampt said those who signed up by dec 31 would never pay an annual 
fee for the rest of their lives as long as they used the card 
once a year to buy something 
since then nearly 7 million cards have been issued making atampt 
one of the biggest forces in the creditcard business the company 
issues its cards through universal bank of columbus ga a 
subsidiary of synovus financial corp 
on tuesday atampt extended the signup deadline until march 26 
1991 the anniversary of the card 
its a way to allow more people to take advantage of a pretty 
good deal said bruce reid a spokesman for the atampt universal 
card services corp subsidiary in jacksonville fla no decision 
has been made on what annual fees might be charged after march 26 
industry analysts speculated atampt prolonged the offer simply 
because its been so effective in helping the company muscle in on 
the domain of bigbank competitors which generally charge an 
annual fee for cards 
the primary reason for atampts enormous success in distribution 
is this freeforlife deal said bruce brittain head of brittain 
associates inc a consulting firm in atlanta that researches 
creditcard use 
when youre in the business of getting the card into peoples 
wallets until you see that growth curve flatten why not continue 
it he said 
kurt peters editor of credit card news a industry publication 
in chicago said the freeforlife offer has been so successful 
that even atampt has been surprised and theyre hesitant to tinker 
with success 
the card also offers users a 10 percent discount on 
longdistance calling card rates as well as the same amenities 
pitched by other leading cards ranging from warranty extensions to 
collision insurance the universal cards interest rate on unpaid 
balances is 189 percent about the same as other key competitors 
the banking industry has fiercely opposed atampts creditcard 
operation and some banks have challenged it on legal grounds 
saying the company has flouted federal regulatory requirements 
atampt says its done nothing improper 
last friday visa usa the payment organization of visa card 
issuers decreed a sixmonth moratorium on new nonbank applicants 
in what was seen as a move to soothe banks unnerved by atampts 
success mastercard the other leading payment organization 
tightened rules for issuers making it more expensive 
the banks have spent years and millions of dollars building up 
mastercard and visa and now they see this nonbank company come in 
and crank up this big creditcard marketing machine peters said 
others said it was premature to judge the ultimate success of 
atampts effort if a substantial number of universal card users pay 
off their balances promptly for example they will deprive atampt of 
interest income 
the jurys still out on how profitable it will be said

the shopping season is racing toward christmas 
but retailers arent reporting highspeed sales 
the faltering economy concerns about the middle east and higher 
taxes all are being cited as contributing factors to weak but not 
disastrous performances in the first two weeks of the crucial 
holiday season 
thanksgiving weekend was pretty good otherwise its been 
somewhat disappointing jc penney co spokesman duncan muir 
said tuesday 
some storeowners were pleased with sales so far but others 
found negative predictions proving correct analysts called overall 
sales sluggish reiterated forecasts for a disappointing christmas 
and said the east coast was hardest hit 
child world inc the nations no 2 chain of toy stores said 
tuesday it would stop paying old bills for six weeks so it can save 
cash to buy toys for the christmas season according to a published 
report today 
jeffrey cole chairman of cnc holdings which controls the 
182store chain of toy supermarkets said it would begin a 100 
million clearance sale and slash prices on saturday in an effort to 
increase business the new york times reported 
cole said the company wanted to avoid a chapter 11 bankruptcy 
court filing child world based in avon mass concentrates on 
the northeast and cole said christmas sales were poor throughout 
the chain child world is a distant second in stores and sales to 
toys r us 
the faltering economy is creating a difficult time for our 
retailers said suzanne mcmillan senior vice president for 
marketing at upscale saks fifth avenue weve experienced some 
highs and lows 
dayton hudson corp chairman kenneth macke said he was satisfied 
with his companys peformance so far 
the thanksgiving weekend was very good and the next week since 
then business has been slower much like we really anticipated it 
would be he said 
like many other retailers macke said he expected business to 
pick up in the last 10 days before christmas 
macke said his companys target discount chain and mervyns 
moderatepriced apparel stores have fared better than dayton 
hudsons department stores evidence that budgetconscious 
consumers were trading down and buying cheaper gifts 
analysts described the retailers results so far as choppy at 
best 
sales seem to be running a little bit better than most 
observers had thought going into the season but its not a good 
season said donald trott an analyst with dean witter reynolds 
inc who follows specialty retailers such as apparel stores 
kidder peabody amp co analyst daniel barry said the northeast and 
middle atlantic states were faring the worst the northwest and 
oilproducing areas have had the strongest sales barry described 
the midwest as very spotty 
many big retailers will announce sales results for november on 
thursday and most of the big chains are expected to report 
declines from november 1989 levels 
the softness so far is n surprise retail sales slumped badly 
in august after the iraqi invasion of kuwait and have not 
recovered even though the holiday season is a time when consumers 
are expected to spend 
many shoppers facing higher oil prices and taxes and concerned 
about job security have said they will do less shopping this 
season 
retailers are getting no help from the weather which has been 
warmer than usual in many parts of the country consumers find it 
hard to get in the mood for christmas when the temperature is in 
the 50s 
but douglas kline a vice president of general growth center 
cos which manages 67 shopping centers in 26 states and washington 
dc said sales are basically humming at his firms malls 
were seeing increases at most markets across the nation 
especially midsize markets in the midwest while business at two 
shopping centers in the northeast is slower he said

people who use home heating oil have been hit 
hard by prices pushed up by war fears but the warmerthanusual 
fall has provided something of a break 
but cold weather has to set in at some point and consumer 
advocates fear energy bills could jump again uncertainties in the 
middle east desert give heating oil the potential to move sharply 
in either direction 
if we begin to get into cold weather and supplies start to be 
drawn down were very concerned prices could go even higher and 
bust peoples energy budget said richard kessel executive 
director of the new york state consumer protection board 
heating oil dealers in the northeast agree a cold snap could 
push prices up but they see war or peace in the middle east as 
having a potentially greater impact because supplies are running 
well ahead of last years levels 
dealers blame the prices which in some cases have gone up about 
four times as much as they might during most cold seasons on war 
fears that have mesmerized the market for months but they say a 
diplomatic solution for getting iraq out of kuwait could send 
prices falling as sharply as they rose 
if peace breaks out the price of this stuff is going to fall 
through the floor said eugene guilford of the maine oil dealers 
association 
recent industry statistics showed the nations stockpile of 
heating oil to be about 15 million barrels higher than it was going 
into december of 1989 largely because many in the industry stocked 
up ahead of time to avoid a repeat of the run on supplies during 
last decembers extreme cold snap 
the ample supply and the lack of cold weather has kessel and 
others thinking that consumers are unfairly being charged too much 
but its not easy to pinpoint a culprit 
whether its purposeful or whether its a product of the 
system i think the market is anticompetitive kessel said 
consumer advocates say an average family that uses heating oil 
can expect to pay 300 to 500 more to keep warm this cold season 
assuming prices stay about the same 
the higher prices are also bad news for retail heating oil 
dealers who say they are getting squeezed by the gulf crisis 
we kind of got hit with a double whammy said vera haskins 
executive vice president of mauger amp co in malvern pa we got 
hit with this warm weather and on top of this we lost about 20 to 
25 percent of our margin coming 
mauger which supplies fuel in the philadelphia area was forced 
to lay off five people from its payroll of about 145 she said 
we kept saying its going to get cold its going to get cold 
but it didnt haskins said dealers are still hoping for cold 
weather although haskins emphasizes most of them would prefer 
normal seasonal cold instead of record cold 
heating oil dealers would rather make their money on 
lowerpriced oil both because they would have less cash invested 
in their inventories and also because fewer people will look to 
alternatives such as natural gas when heating oil is cheap 
the fact that were no longer as competitive is a killer in 
our industry haskins said 
each 10 rise in the price of crude oil pushes heating oil up by 
about 25 cents said bob greenes of the new york oil heat 
association in some northeast markets the price has gone up as 
much as 39 cents a gallon this season to more than 140 a gallon

prudentialbache securities inc is abandoning 
the oncelucrative trading of stocks of potential takeover targets 
a business hurt sharply by the end of the 1980s mergers boom 
also first boston corp confirmed tuesday it laid off 55 
workers in its fixedincome department as part of a companywide 
restructuring designed to slash 200 jobs in the last two months of 
the year 
the moves were further signs of weakness on wall street top 
firms are cutting jobs and axing key business areas to cope with a 
threeyear industry recession being made worse by the ailing 
economy and middle east crisis 
prudentialbache said in a statement it is ceasing proprietary 
risk arbitrage trading that is securities trading for the firms 
own account in stocks of companies believed to be targeted for 
takeovers 
the move was the second major business reduction by 
prudentialbache in the last month the firm laid off 120 of its 
180 investment bankers because of a downturn in financing mergers 
and acquisitions 
several other firms also have reduced their investment banking 
forces most recently painewebber inc this week began dismissing 
a reported 18 percent of its 160 investment bankers 
a prudentialbache spokeswoman said that guy wyserpratte a top 
arbitrager with 25 years at the firm would help wind down the risk 
arbitrage departments operations wyserpratte 50 was said by 
wall street sources to be seeking to move his 12person department 
to another firm 
risk arbitrage was one of wall streets most lucrative trading 
areas in the booming 1980s but a sharp decline in mergers and 
acquisitions more than 16 percent in the first 10 months of 1990 
according to idd information services has limited opportunities 
for the risky trading activity 
in a memo last month to employees prudentialbache chairman 
george l ball said the risk arbitrage department lost money in 
1989 and so far in 1990 risk arb is a business which ails in a 
bear market and we are in a bear market ball said 
the first boston bond department layoffs include lowlevel 
support staff and veteran professionals with as much as 20 years at 
the firm first boston employees said 
the cuts are part of a restructuring at first boston announced 
last month that features an overhaul of senior management and a 
725 million cash and equity injection by the swiss owner of cs 
first boston inc first boston corp is the main us subsidiary of 
cs first boston 
first boston employees said the 55 layoffs included personnel 
who reported to departed vice chairman william voute and managing 
directors e craig coats and ronald stuart who came tofirst 
boston from salomon inc 
the three were touted highly by the firm but clashed repeatedly 
with management they and two other former salomon executives were 
ousted from first boston last month

a japanese bank has agreed to provide up to 30 
million to back a partnership with a top wall street mergers and 
acquisitions specialist in a new investment banking firm 
the alliance between sanwa bank ltd and former first boston 
corp executive michael duval announced tuesday is the latest 
between major banks and emerging investment firms 
eric gleacher a former morgan stanley amp co executive last 
summer formed a partnership with morgan grenfell plc the merchant 
banking company owned by deutsche bank group 
the latest new firm to be known as sanwa duval will be owned 
by duval the bank and other partners duval said in an interview 
sanwa the worlds fifthlargest bank has agreed to provide 30 
million to back the partnership duval said sanwa duval will take 
over the operations currently carried out by the merchant banking 
group of sanwas offices in new york and los angeles 
the new firm will be managed by duval and shuhei sato senior 
vice president of sanwas merchant banking arm 
duval left first boston as a managing director last summer and 
formed his own firm the duval group he had helped arrange first 
bostons merger with its londonbased affiliate financiere credit 
suissefirst boston 
before joining first boston in 1984 duval spent seven years at 
mead corp and before that served in the nixon and ford 
administrations 
sanwa duval will be an investment banker advising clients on 
proposed transactions but will not create its own fund to 
participate in deals of its own duval said 
that decision places sanwa duval in a different league from 
wasserstein perella amp co the investment firm formed by two other 
first boston alumni although bruce wasserstein and joseph perella 
have advised clients on deals including the 245 billion buyout of 
rjr nabisco inc they also have entered into transactions 
themselves 
duval said he was more interested in advising longterm clients 
rather than picking up business on a dealbydeal basis with 
clients who are potential rivals in transactions 
duval said he expects his new firm mostly to advise us 
companies seeking strategic acquisitions joint ventures or 
divestitures but he said he also expects to handle crossborder 
transactions in which one party is american and the other foreign 
while most crossborder deals are likely to involve european 
parties duval predicted the firm will be handling an increasing 
amount of transactions with japanese firms 
although japanese markets have generally been closed to american 
buyers and investors i think its opening up duval said 
sanwa duval expects to be operating in early 1991 after it has 
received government approval duval said

in the latest corporate attempt to meet 
environmental concerns cocacola and pepsi cola plan to market 
products in recycled plastic bottles 
the rival soft drink makers said tuesday they were seeking 
government approval for separate proposals to use recycled plastic 
the food and drug administration to date has approved just one case 
submitted by an egg company in which recycled plastic can be 
used in direct contact with food 
the fda regards recycled plastic as an indirect additive to 
food said agency spokesman chris lecos 
plastic bottles are widely recycled now but the finished 
material is used for such products as carpeting piping and 
nonfood containers not for food packaging 
the environmental group greenpeace said it was unimpressed with 
the cola makers plans greenpeace spokeswoman julie brenegar said 
the beverage companies would do better by eliminating plastic 
packaging altogether 
plastics recycling is yet another way the plastics industry is 
trying to justify the use of plastics she said adding that new 
virgin plastic is needed even for recycled packages 
therefore she said plastic recycling makes only a small dent 
in the amount of raw material introduced to the environment 
jackie prince a staff scientist at the washingtonbased 
environmental defense fund said the coke and pepsi plans mark a 
step in the right direction by expanding the uses for recycled 
plastic 
the reality is there is a lot of plastic out there now and 
wed like to see whats there recycled she said this brings 
plastics recycling further along the learning curve 
coke spokesman randy donaldson said the recycling proposal was 
submitted to the fda in june and officials at the atlantabased 
company hope to test market the new bottles sometime in 1991 before 
launching a fullscale rollout 
pepsi also said it plans to have the recycled bottles in stores 
next year fda spokesman jeff nesbitt said the agency has been 
talking to pepsis partner in the project goodyear tire and rubber 
co about their planned recycling process and plans to review the 
data shortly 
the fda review of the bottles will include analysis of product 
quality consumer safety and environmental impact 
i think recycling is one thing the cola warriors agree on 
totally said andrew giangola a spokesman at the pepsi cola 
cos headquarters in somers ny they are both working with the 
mutual goal of creating the most environmentally correct 
packaging 
producing new plastic beverage bottles with a blend of 
recycled plastic is a significant step ahead in plastics 
recycling said m douglas ivester senior vice president at the 
cocacola co 
several companies have taken steps to reduce the amount of solid 
waste disposed of in landfills mcdonalds in a highly publicized 
move recently announced it will stop using plastic foam containers 
at its fast food restaurants 
coke and pepsi already use recycled steel aluminum and glass 
for packaging pepsi officials estimated that about onethird of 
soft drinks are in plastic bottles though cans are the most widely 
used 
coke said its process developed with hoechst celanese corp 
involves breaking down the bottle polymer into original molecules 
then reconstructing the purified resin for use in making new 
bottles 
pepsis bottles to be made by sewell plastics inc of atlanta 
use repete a recycled resin based on ground soft drink bottles and 
produced by goodyear the material is put back together with raw 
materials to make the recycled bottles 
jesse meyers publisher of the industry newsletter beverage 
digest said recycled bottles give the soft drink business a way to 
defend continued use of plastic amid fighting between the glass and 
plastics industries 
despite the pronouncements of concern for the environment its 
also a way to stimulate soft drink consumption by attracting 
publicity to the products meyers said 
the cola wars whether its rock singers taste tests or 
packaging it creates business for the industry e said the 
cola wars is the only war where there are no losers

buyout offer from atampt but the companys directors will have its

while the board unanimously rejected a previous offer of 85 per 
share from atampt it has yet to formally vote on a 90pershare 
proposal a board meeting was scheduled to be conducted by 
telephone today 
american telephone amp telegraph co announced its stockswap 
offer to buy the ncr the nations fifthlargest computer maker on 
sunday 
exley said the deal made no business sense and that ncr had no 
interest in merging operations with atampt the telephone giant has 
said it may make a tender offer directly to shareholders if ncrs 
board doesnt act on the proposal by this evening 
ncr stock which soared nearly 25 a share on monday rose 
another 2 to 8350 tuesday on the new york stock exchange atampt 
which had fallen 2 a share recovered slightly to close at 3037

in a speech to ncr employees tuesday exley urged workers to 
have confidence in the ability of management to make decisions that 
are in the best interests of all who have a stake in the company 
we have made it perfectly clear to atampt and anyone else who 
cares to listen that we have no interest in being acquired and we 
must face the fact that we may face a lengthy takeover battle 
exley told the workers 
a union representing 110000 atampt employees encouraged ncr to 
oppose the buyout saying the takeover could lead to layoffs at 
both companies if atampt is forced to make cuts because of a high 
purchase price

thousands of bondholders who financed the 
expansion of continental airlines over the past seven years top a 
600page list of creditors in a bankruptcy petition filed by the 
carrier 
the chapter 11 filing lists 6205 million of continentals 22 
billion debt owed to bondholders about 17 billion of 
continentals debt is secured by collateral 
continental the remnants of frank lorenzos texas air corp 
empire said it filed for the reorganization monday in federal 
court in wilmington del because it was overwhelmed by its debts 
and surging fuel prices 
banks in california texas new jersey new york and switzerland 
are acting as trustees for the bonds which are due between 1991 
and 2005 bank officials who declined to be identified said they 
had not yet seen a copy of the bankruptcy petition and declined 
comment 
a creditors committee is being formed to work with the 
bankruptcy court to restructure continentals debt 
the bonds issued by continental make up the lions share of the 
largest unsecured creditors listed in the petition others include 
prattwhitney canada inc dobbs international services inc an 
airline food service vendor american express co general electric 
corp and boeing co 
the filing was the second time in seven years continental has 
sought to reorganize an analyst with price waterhouse said there

protection from creditors but a court must approve the move 
in 1983 as lorenzo was building texas air into what once was 
the nations largest airline operator continental filed for 
protection from creditors amid a bitter labor dispute with its 
union 
the firing allowed continental to scrap union contracts and hire 
lowcost replacements for strikers it also led to a change in 
federal bankruptcy law to make such a move more difficult 
as of sept 30 continental had 477 billion in assets and 
585 billion in total liabilities with 138 million cash on hand

once considered river trash the 
whiskered catfish is turning up in avantgarde restaurants and on 
fastfood menus from coast to coast 
i eat in a lot of places around this country many of them 
now have catfish on the menu says craig claiborne cookbook 
author and retired new york times food editor 
last year sales of farmraised catfish ranked the variety as 
one of the nations top five seafoods behind only tuna shrimp 
cod and alaska pollock 
but despite its rising popularity the boon predicted for the 
aquaculture industry in the 1960s hasnt fully come to pass 
the pie is getting larger but the pieces are getting 
smaller said roger barlow catfish marketing director for the 
mississippi department of agriculture 
nutritional value and the consistent taste brought by 
highprotein feed allowed the catfish industry to grow 
dramatically but that growth also brought more competition 
especially in processing barlow said 
catfish farmers also are facing rising costs labor demands and 
softening sales 
catfish farming started in mississippi in 1966 with 40 acres 
now the industry is the states fourth leading agricultural crop 
contributing more than 300 million to the state economy in 1989 
many farmers in the mississippi delta region switched to catfish 
in the early 1980s because the traditional agriculture industry was 
slumping aquaculture allowed them to use their land and skills and 
brought new economic strength to the state 
the new industry also provided thousands of new jobs for 
unskilled and semiskilled workers idled when machinery replaced 
many jobs throughout the delta region 
the states catfish industry now employs more than 6000 people 
with an annual payroll of more than 76 million according to the 
catfish institute in belzoni which is located in humphreys county 
the catfish capital of the world 
this year catfish operations in the state will raise harvest 
and process more than 380 million pounds of fresh catfish 
the fish is processed by 25 to 30 companies most of which are 
in the state including the nations largest two 
but a glut in processing forced four processing plants to close 
in 198990 and many processors say they are pinched by higher 
prices they pay to farmers 
about 85 percent of the catfish supplied to processors in 
mississippi is produced by members of the catfish bargaining 
association which fixes selling prices for processors processors 
are paying farmers 80 cents a pound this year compared to 71 or 72 
cents last year 
some processors say this years price is about 10 cents too 
high 
the nations secondlargest processor isolabased country 
skillet catfish co has even threatened to expand into farming 
unless it can secure lower prices from farmers 
if were faced with no option well start farming said 
dick stevens country skillets president we cant afford to buy 
fish at what prices are today we have to buy raw materials 
relevant to market prices 
country skillets retail sales and sales of live fish are 
slowing because of the higher prices stevens said 
i guess the farmers wanted to make a sackful of money he 
said instead of creating a good situation farmers have created 
a nightmare 
country skillet which is owned by food processing giant conagra 
inc of omaha neb is among the major catfish processors in the 
delta region rebelling against efforts by farmers to control the 
price of whole fish 
but many processors are cooperatives of catfish growers who 
benefit from higher base prices 
delta pride catfish inc of indianola the nations largest 
catfish processor is owned by a 180member farmer cooperative 
and it supports fixed prices 
that hasnt stopped workers from the united food and commercial 
workers unions from going on strike at two delta pride plants 
the workers walked out sept 12 after turning down a contract 
proposal offering a 48 percent average wage increase in the first 
year and pay increases averaging 35 to 90 cents per hour over the 
remaining two years of the pact 
the workers many of whom are unskilled or semiskilled black 
women say the raises are not enough negotiations are to resume 
dec 12 
the increased demand for catfish due no doubt to its more 
refined taste and image is one of the best safeguards that the 
industry will survive barlow said 
in years past the fishytasting river variety of catfish were 
caught with a cane pole with worm bait they were cleaned rolled 
in cornmeal and deepfried and usually served with hush puppies 
small fried balls of cornmeal dough 
now consumers can buy pondfed catfish in grocery stores as 
whole dressed fish steaks filets strips and nuggets recipes 
offer ways to poach barbecue broil smoke stirfry fry bake 
steam braise stew blacken saute or grill dishes 
french chefs ive talked with are fond of both the flavor and 
texture of pondraised catfish claiborne said

defense attorneys tried to impress upon jurors 
the distinction between rule violations and fraud as the 11week 
trial of 10 soybean traders and brokers winds to a close 
violating a rule is not inconsistent with good faith 
attorney matthias lydon told us district court jurors in closing 
arguments tuesday 
his client edward a cox and the nine others are charged with 
racketeering conspiracy and fraud in their dealings at the chicago 
board of trade they were among 48 people arrested in a federal 
undercover investigation at the board and the chicago mercantile 
exchange 
the government has presented witnesses who testified that they 
participated in improper trading with the defendants or witnessed 
it 
in their closing arguments prosecutors scoffed at the concept 
of traders breaking the rules to benefit customers 
these men intended to get money from customers under false 
pretenses said mark rotert an assistant us attorney they 
think things like ethics fairness and the law are a matter of 
context 
defense attorney jim epstein conceded his client martin j 
dempsey broke trading rules but denied any intent to defraud and 
instead insisted these violations often benefited customers at no 
ones expense 
did he violate the rules epstein asked rhetorically 
referring to dempsey absolutely 
did he attempt to commit fraud absolutely not 
epstein reminded jurors that testimony indicated many of the 
rule violations were an everyday practice on the trading floor 
one such violation is curb trading which occurs in the trading 
pit in the seconds or minutes after the closing bel 
sure he did curb trading epstein said of his client is 
he proud of it no did he try to conceal it of course he did 
but not because he was committing fraud but because he 
was breaking the rules 
the defense contends the prosecution tried to confuse the two 
issues to trick the jury into believing that concealing what they 
were doing was a sign they were trying to cheat the customers 
curb trading has been going on for who knows how long it goes 
on every day its no secret epstein told the jury 
he said customers sometimes file orders just seconds before the 
close and theres no way he said for a broker to comply without 
trading beyond the bell at other times epstein said a customer 
specifies his buyorsell order should be made at the closing 
price which sometimes makes trading go beyond beyond the closing 
so people get the fill on the close he said other than 
breaking the rule youre not cheating anyone 
on trial before judge george marovich in addition to dempsey 
and cox are charles w bergstrom bradley ashman william a 
barcal iii thomas p kenney john ryan joel j fetchenhier

foray into new england with five discount stores planned in new

the european community was given a 
deadline of noon thursday to draw up a new proposal for sharper 
cuts in agriculture subsidies and rescue deadlocked world trade 
talks officials said today 
uruguayan foreign minister hector gros espiell imposed the 
deadline after a series of meetings to try to find a way to move 
the stalled uruguay round negotiations 
were ready to move by noon tomorrow said hugo paemen a 
senior negotiator for the 12nation trading bloc the ec is 
discussing new agriculture proposals as well as proposals in other 
areas 
but ray macsharry the communitys top farm official who has 
been a hardliner in the negotiations said our degree of 
flexibility is minimal 
a lot of contracting partners need to rethink not just the 
european community the ec cannot be expected to give in on 
everything he told reporters 
david woods spokesman for the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade which is sponsoring the talks confirmed the action by gros 
espiell who is presiding over the bargaining 
he basically wants to see some new approach from the community 
by midday tomorrow in order to restart the negotiations said 
woods 
the talks stalled tuesday amid heavy pressure from the united 
states and other countries on the european community to make deep 
cuts in farm supports the talks also cover trade in services 
textiles and other major areas 
woods said gros espiell disclosed his deadline in a series of 
meetings with trade negotiators to try to solve the crisis 
us agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said gros espiell 
has informed folks that unless several of these major areas are 
essentially brought to a conclusion or close to a conclusion by 
tomorrow thursday noon were never going to get finished 
so in essence hes given the conferees until tomorrow noon to 
get on top of these major issues yeutter told reporters 
gros espiell said tuesday the talks were in a very serious 
impasse and started meeting with individual delegations to 
explore prospects for a breakthrough 
australia and canada appealed to the european community to back 
off its hardline position opposing deep cuts in farm supports and 
save the 107nation uruguay round the most wideranging trade 
bargaining ever 
work continued behindthescenes to try to strike deals in some 
of the other 15 areas under negotiation but officials conceded 
that little progress could be made until a solution was found to 
the agriculture dispute 
i dont think anybody is going to commit themselves to 
anything while the negotiation is in this stage said the gatt 
spokesman woods we are trying to see if there is any chance for 
movement in the areas that are blocked 
the negotiations kicked off in 1986 in the uruguayan resort of 
punta del este are designed to overhaul world trade in 15 areas 
including agriculture manufactured goods textiles and services 
such as telecommunications transportation and banking 
the latest week of bargaining which opened on monday has been 
stalled by the european communitys refusal to go along with deep 
cuts in its extensive farm support program as demanded by the 
united states and others 
attention focused on an evening meeting between german 
chancellor helmut kohl and french president francois mitterrand for 
any sign of a breakthrough on the agriculture problem 
leading up to the talks france and germany were the most 
resistant to deep cuts in farm supports the german government had 
been worried about the farm vote in last sundays elections 
australian prime minister bob hawke said he was imploring 
kohl and mitterrand to inject the political will and the courage 
which is obviously necessary to prevent a debacle in these 
negotiations 
john crosbie canadas trade minister said we would like to 
have mr kohl and mr mitterrand instruct their negotiators 
that their offer now has to be changed in accordance with what the 
rest of the world is wanting 
there have been hints of cracks in the communitys position 
opposing any but the most modest reductions in farm subsidies 
britain the netherlands and surprisingly germany have urged more 
flexibility 
trade ministers of the 12nation community were scheduled to 
meet in early evening to take a fresh look at the situation 
us president george bush seemed to signal a willingness to 
give some on the american side 
bush traveling tuesday in uruguay said we are not locked on 
a specific figure on how deeply farm subsidies should be cut 
we are locked on the fact that there has to be inclusion of all 
categories of products 
in an october offer the bush administration proposed cuts in 
farm subsidies ranging from 75 percent to 90 percent over the next 
decade export subsidies payments to promote sales of a countrys 
products overseas were targeted for the deepest slashes 
the european community so far has offered to snip only 30 
percent from subsidies for major crops over 10 years beginning in 
1986 some reductions already have been made prompting us 
critics to contend that much less than 30 percent would occur in 
the next five years 
the uruguay round is the eighth in a series of negotiating 
sessions since world war ii designed to reduce barriers to world 
trade 
the general agreement on tariffs and trade was established in 
1947 as a forum and an agreement for promoting free trade

the italian government on wednesday 
authorized olivetti to temporarily lay off 2800 workers next month 
following a drop in international sales for the office automation 
equipment giant 
but the government rejected an olivetti request for a special 
early retirement program for 5000 italianbased workers 
the group is trying to reduce its worldwide workforce by 7000 
to 47000 in 1991 
budget minister cirino pomicino stressed that the retirement 
plan calling for men to retire at 50 instead of 55 and women to 
leave at 47 instead of 50 would be an unbearable burden for the 
state pension fund 
olivetti which is owned and managed by italian financier carlo 
de benedetti said that the layoffs to begin in january will be a 
temporary measure but it did not disclose its duration 
the 2800 workers to be laid off will receive compensation of up 
to 80 percent of their original salary from a state fund 
the powerful metalworkers unions called a fivehour strike in 
the olivetti factories to protest what they called the companys 
onesided decision on layoffs 
unions are also opposed to olivettis early retirement proposal 
the companys managing director vittorio cassoni said the plan is 
not an option but is necessary to help olivetti face the crisis in 
the computer industry 
analysts said that olivettis crisis is due to the growing 
competition of us and japanese manufacturers and to weak demand 
worldwide which is severely affecting the major european makers of 
information technology 
office automation is not the only sector faced with a severe 
recession in italy 
fiat italys auto giant has laid off about 70000 workers this 
month to cut its production

usx corp chairman charles a corry said the 
company hopes to resum talks soon with the united steelworkers 
union but said the likelihood of a strike has increased 
speaking to financial writers tuesday in new york corry said 
usx hoped to reach an early agreement with 18000 union workers 
negotiators for the company and the union met this fall to try to 
work out a new pact 
the current contract expires jan 31 and talks were recessed on 
nov 10 
we had some negotiations we made an offer i dont think that 
offer was ever countered corry said the early effort 
failed 
corry said one stumbling block is a union demand for a more 
lucrative contract than agreements reached with other steel 
companies 
after his remarks corry told the pittsburgh postgazette he was 
unable to say if usx is willing to continue operating under a 
contract extension if the deadline is not met 
you have a different situation than last time it was 
concessionary bargaining then so if you worked under the existing 
contract you paid more corry said this time its really a 
question of if the steelworkers are willing to work under the 
existing contract 
corry also said he believes a proxy battle with financier carl 
c icahn is inevitable icahn the companys largest shareholder 
with a 13 percent stake asked usx to restructure its steel and 
energy units before the annual meeting in may 
icahn has said he will seek to place five people on the board of 
directors to force the issue 
i have to take him at his word corry said

labor market conditions worsened in october with 
no sign of a quick turnaround a leading business research group 
reported wednesday in a monthly survey of helpwanted advertising 
the conference boards helpwanted advertising index fell to 116 
in october six points below the september level and 34 points 
below the yearearlier level 
the indexs decline substantiated other assessments of growing 
trouble in the us labor market which has been beset by layoffs 
and reduced hiring plans because of an underlying economic decline 
that some are calling a recession 
on monday for example manpower inc the worlds largest 
temporary help firm reported in a quarterly survey that hiring 
plans of us companies will plunge to recession depths in the 
first quarter of 1991 
the decline in the economy in the fourth quarter affords very 
little opportunity to develop new jobs conference board 
economist kenneth goldstein said layoffs continue to climb as 
does the national unemployment rate 
the national unemployment level which moved from 52 percent in 
june to 57 percent as of october will likely climb to 65 percent 
in the second half of 1991 goldstein asserted the labor 
department is scheduled to release its figures on november 
unemployment this friday 
the conference board survey showed advertising volume in 
newspapers fell almost everywhere in the country particularly in 
the southeast with a 128 percent decline and new england with a 
92 percent decline the least affected was the pacific region but 
helpwanted ad volume there still fell 42 percent 
more disturbing the conference board survey suggested was a 
52 percent drop in helpwanted advertising in the midwest which 
has enjoyed relative prosperity in recent months because of a 
manufacturing resurgence and foreign demand for us goods 
there has been a significant deterioration in the labor 
markets of the pacific and the south atlantic goldstein said 
even more telling job advertising declines are now firmly set 
in americas heartland 
the survey assesses helpwanted advertising volume in 51 major 
newspapers across the country every month and is considered a 
sensitive barometer to changes in the supply of jobs 
the conference board is a businessfunded research organization 
based in new york

the european communitys executive 
commission on wednesday outlined a proposal toredistribute takeoff 
and landing slots at airports in the economic bloc 
the proposal intended to help smaller airlines compete in the 
increasingly congested ec market has attracted widespread 
criticism from airlines 
sir leon brittan ec commissioner for competition policy said 
smaller airlines would be given priority for half of slots 
landing and takeoff spaces in the airtraffic pattern that 
became available 
he said that the sting in the tail of the proposal was that 
the commission could intervene in cases where it thought that slots 
werent distributed fairly 
the plan represented a concerted attempt by us to provide 
opportunities to smaller airlines who up to now have not had 
them brittan told reporters 
under the complicated proposal slots allocated to but unused by 
bigger airlines at a particular airport would be distributed to 
smaller airlines defined as those holding no more than 30 percent 
of slots there 
any airline not using more than 65 percent of its allocated 
slots would have to relinquish excess slots for redistribution 
brittan said 
a problem with the proposal is that small airlines themselves 
are not sure it will work many say the existing system for 
allocating slots through trafficscheduling committees run by the 
airlines works reasonably well 
another problem is that even if they gain more slots at busy 
airports small airlines do not have large enough fleets to 
compete 
ec transport commissioner karel van miert said he did not know 
how many slots the major airlines would have to give up its 
very difficult because of the reciprocity between airports he 
said 
under the proposal if a new airline were granted a takeoff slot 
at one airport it would have to be given a landing slot at 
another the commission would limit the number of new slots for new 
airlines to four each day

the european communitys executive 
commission wednesday proposed requiring large firms operating in 
more than one member country to establish councils for consulting 
workers in decisionmaking 
at the least the councils would be forums where employes would 
be informed of and consulted on any management proposal likely 
to have serious consequences for the interest of the workers the 
commission said in a statement 
individual ec nations have laws requiring companies to consult 
workers ut there are no rules for companies operating in more 
than one ec nation 
the commission termed its proposal which requires the approval 
of the 12 ec states before it can become law an important 
moment in the 12nation trade blocs progress toward the 1992 
internal market 
only companies operating in at least two ec states and employing 
at least 1000 workers would be required to set up the works 
councils under the legislation proposed by the commission

saatchi amp saatchi co plc the worlds 
secondlargest advertising agency group said wednesday it lost 
982 million pounds or 166 million in fiscal 1990 the biggest 
yearly loss ever for such a company 
it was the second consecutive annual loss for the company that 
grew rapidly through acquisitions in the 1980s to become one of the 
biggest advertising and marketing services companies in the world 
but the company stumbled when it branched out into the 
consulting business and has spent more than a year arranging sales 
of those operations 
in announcing its huge loss saatchi also said it wouldnt pay a 
dividend to its shareholders this year it paid a dividend of 9 
pence or 15 cents a share a year ago 
the company blamed the loss for the year ended sept 30 on its 
efforts to focus on its communications operations and to withdraw 
from consulting 
our withdrawal from consulting reduces our downside risk 
the company said in a statement 
saatchi said it plans to concentrate on advertising media 
buying direct marketing and public relations 
but saatchis operating results from communications businesses 
like these declined in the latest year results were strong in the 
united states and continental europe but sank in britain and the 
rest of the world 
the overall loss was the second annual loss in a row for 
saatchi which had previously bought ads of its own to tout its 
string of earnings gains saatchi lost 727 million pounds in 
fiscal 1989 
chairman maurice saatchi said in a statement 1991 will be a 
difficult year for the group but when market conditions do improve 
i believe the group will be well positioned to benefit from the 
upturn 
advertising agencies generally have been hurt by the worldwide 
economic downturn 
wpp group plc the worlds largest advertising group last month 
announced that its pretax profit wouldnt match analysts 
expectations of 110 million pounds or 213 million and the news 
sent the companys share price diving 
neil blackley an advertising analyst with the london investment 
firm james capel and co said the outlook is very poor indeed 
with the us economy weakening and the economies going down in 
mainland europe and the impact on margins will be felt 
saatchis financial position is not good in order to survive 
the company is going to have to restructure debt of 1765 million 
pounds or 342 million he said 
the loss for fiscal 1990 reflected an extraordinary loss of 769 
million pounds or 130 million on asset disposals property 
provisions and other expenses compared with a loss of 585 
million pounds on such items a year earlier 
pretax profit rose 63 percent to 356 million pounds or 60 
million from 218 million pounds a year earlier but the latest 
results were helped by substantially reduced restructuring costs 
compared with a year ago 
the 1989 results included reorganization and streamlining of the 
groups communications division plus costs from its consulting 
business 
sales dropped 17 percent to 8081 million pounds or 137 
billion from 9735 million pounds in fiscal 1989 
operating profit for its communications division fell 10 percent 
to 63 million pounds or 106 million 
its us communications activities had a 12 percent rise in 
operating profit while continental european operations posted a 25 
percent gain but the operating profit from british communications 
activities fell 48 percent and in the rest of the world it fell 72 
percent 
saatchi said that its two remaining consulting businesses will 
be sold when market conditions improve they are litigation 
sciences inc of los angeles and msl international a londonbased 
executive recruitment business 
it completed the 70 million sale of gartner group inc a 
stamford connbased market information company earlier this 
year the price was below saatchis original expectations 
saatchis results were converted at an averaged exchange rate 
for the fiscal year of 169 to the pound

japanese telecommunications giant nippon telegraph 
and telephone said wednesday it has developed a palmsize portable 
telephone that is the lightest and smallest in the world 
the 81ounce cellular phone to be made by four japanese 
electronics companies can carry a continuous conversation for 45 
minutes ntt said 
new miniaturized lowpower circuitry is used to cut its size to 
92 cubic inches compared with 135 cubic inches for motorola 
incs microtac telephone it said 
the microtac which the us company says is the worlds 
smallest cellular phone weighs 107 ounces and can transmit for up 
to 30 minutes with its slimsized battery and up to 100 minutes 
with a slightly thicker battery motorola spokesman david pinsky 
said motorola introduced microtac two years ago 
pinsky speaking from his companys schaumburg ill 
headquarters said motorola would have no comment on the ntt phone 
until it receives more information on it 
the new phone comes out on top in all three areas size 
weight and battery life said ntts kazuyoshi terada after 
feeling melancholy for two years we now can feel proud about 
having the best portable phone 
the phone is about onethird the size and weight of the smallest 
model currently marketed by ntt japans main telephone company 
it will be available in four designs containing the same 
nttdeveloped circuitry each manufactured by a different japanese 
electronics firm the four companies are nec corp matsushita 
electric mitsubishi electric and fujitsu ntt said 
the phone features automatic dialing message notification by 
either audio or light signals and a selection of three different 
message notification tones it also has a builtin electronic 
memory for storing up to 100 names and telephone numbers 
ntt said it plans to begin marketing the telephone in japan in 
april although it will not sell the phone overseas the companies 
that participated in its development may market similar products 
outside japan in the future terada said 
ntt said it was able to reduce the volume of radio parts in the 
phone by about onehalf by developing new highdensity integrated 
circuits and reducing the size of other components however the 
phone contains two separate receivers and antennas including one 
inside the case and can automatically pick the stronger of the two 
signals to improve reception it said 
the phone saves battery power by automatically limiting 
transmission strength to the minimum amount needed transmission 
power is a maximum 06 watts the same as in the microtac ntt 
said 
the new ntt phone like most existing cellular phones uses 
analog technology while digital technology which allows many more 
callers to use te service at once is considered the wave of the 
future 
motorolas digital voicecoder technology was selected last 
summer as the future japanese national standard a move that helped 
defuse trade tensions over japans cellular telephone market 
those tensions also were eased when the japanese government 
agreed in june to allow motorolas analog cellular technology to be 
used on frequencies in the tokyo area which had been limited to 
ntt technology 
previously motorola supplied analog cellular equipment to ntt 
and other japanese companies only outside tokyo

grain and soybean futures prices closed lower 
wednesday on the chicago board of trade as concern over the lack of 
progress in the trade and tariff talks depressed the market 
the lack of export business to the soviet union also weighed on 
the market said dan cekander an analyst with rodman amp renshaw 
inc in chicago 
the market had been pumped up over all the talk of extending 
credits to the russians he said the market remains 
optimistic it will happen but it has settled back to wait 
the extension of a us credit package would allow the soviet 
union to buy badly needed grain 
cekander said there also was concern the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade negotiations under way in brussels could 
collapse the main obstacle is the demand by the united states and 
other countries that the european community reduce farm subsidies 
analysts say a breakdown of the talks scheduled to end this 
week could result in a world trade war which would hurt us farm 
exports 
at the close wheat was a cent to 2 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in december at 243 a bushel corn was a 
cent to 1 cents lower with december at 227 a bushel oats were 1 
cent to 2 cent lower with december at 110 a bushel soybeans 
were 2 cents to 9 cents lower with january at 593 a bushel

the acquisition of holiday inns has helped bass 
plc post a 23 percent jump in annual profits but the us hotel 
industrys downturn now is clouding the outlook for the worlds 
largest hotel operator 
bass chairman ian prosser told a news conference wednesday 
overall we are finding trading conditions difficult 
in a statement prosser warned that unless there is a swift 
change in economic conditions leading to improved business 
confidence and an increase in consumer spending we expect those 
conditions to prevail for most of 1991 
bryan langton chief executive of the companys holiday inn 
division told reporters that us hotels have been pressured by a 
slowdown in demand from both business travelers and vacationers 
langton cited the us recession but declined to quantify the 
effect on the company 
bass acquired the north american assets of holiday corp for 
198 billion in february after paying 475 million for its 
international hotels in 1988 
the second purchase was clinched as the us economy slowed a 
glut of hotel rooms in the united states whose 40000 hotels make 
it the worlds largest hotel market now is forcing operators to 
cut rates to attract business 
langton maintained that holiday inns could weather a slowdown 
citing bass strategy of segmenting the holiday inn product it has 
been developing holiday inn express targeting the upper level of 
the economy class for example 
as many as 1450 of bass hotels are located in north america 
rather than faster growing areas elsewhere in the world making 
bass vulnerable 
but langton said that fact that 1365 of its 1605 hotels are 
franchised rather than owned or operated will help insulate the 
company 
bass also has better financing and is not as indebted as some of 
its competitors and holiday inns is a strong brand name he said 
our relative strength gives us the opportunity to outperform 
the market langton said 
bass said its net profit for the year ended sept 30 came to 470 
million pounds or 808 million compared with 382 million pounds 
or 657 million in the same period a year earlier 
earnings per share came to 1096 pence or 189 compared with 
927 pence or 159 
pretax profit rose 15 percent to 535 million pounds or 920 
million from 465 million pounds or 800 million 
revenue climbed 105 percent to 446 billion pounds or 767 
billion from 404 billion pounds or 695 billion dollars 
the groups hotel operations saw operating profit jump 69 
percent to 127 million pounds or 218 million from 75 million 
pounds or 129 million 
holiday inns accounted for 103 million pounds or 177 million 
of that 1990 profit bass didnt provide the yearago figure 
langton said holiday inns profit had met the companys 
expectations and he said holiday inns performance improved over 
the year 
holiday inns occupancy rate increased 09 percent over the 
previous year and outperformed its competitors in the middle of 
the market he said 
bass brewing operations also experienced strong growth rising 
21 percent to 177 million pounds or 304 million from 146 million 
pounds 251 million its brands include carling black label lamot 
pils and tennents 
the company said it had 108 million pounds or 186 million of 
onetime costs because of the british governments decision to 
force brewers to focus either on brewing or pub operations 
the decision aimed at fostering more competition in 
brewerowned pubs that sell their own beers means bass will have 
to sell or free up 2680 pubs by november 1992 
bass 6886 pubs make the company britains largest pub owner 
the company also has smaller interests in betting and soft drinks 
bass didnt break out results for the latest quarter or second 
half of the year it isnt required to under british law 
the figures were converted at companyprovided exchange rate of 
172 to the pound

oil prices fell more than 3 per barrel today to 
the lowest level in more than three months on news that iraq would 
discuss a peaceful solution to the persian gulf crisis 
with just minutes left to trade on the new york mercantile 
exchange light sweet crude the key grade of oil was down 331 
at 2735 per barrel on contracts for delivery in january the 
exchange said crude had last traded below 28 per barrel for 
nextmonth delivery on aug 31 
oil came crashing down in the afternoon when the us government 
said iraq had accepted its offer for highlevel diplomatic talks on 
the desert standoff that began when iraq seized neighboring kuwait 
aug 2 
thats what pushed it through said thomas p blakeslee an 
energy analyst at pegasus econometric group inc in hoboken nj 
there was some good selling at that point 
earlier oil prices were down more than 2 per barrel today on a 
television report indicating negotiations might bring a peaceful 
end to the persian gulf crisis 
cable news network reported this morning that iraqi president 
saddam hussein was feeling enormous pressure to withdraw from 
kuwait and quoted a ranking iraqi source it did not identify as 
saying all issues are on the table everything 
after opening lower following tuesdays british television 
report indicating iraq might have a plan for pulling out of kuwait 
crude started moving up when secretary of state james a baker iii 
warned congress that delaying war with iraq could be harmful 
should war become necessary 
the cnn report then prompted crude to reverse direction said 
christian gohler a broker at merrill lynch energy futures 
contracts for oil delivery in later months were all moving down 
though not as dramatically as the january crude 
futures for refined petroluem products were also tumbling this 
afternoon 
home heating oil dropped 325 cents to 8365 cents a gallon on 
contracts for delivery in january unleaded gasoline fell 432 
cents to 7160 cents a gallon on contracts for delivery in january 
oils drop in new york followed a fall in london that came in 
reaction to an unconfirmed report that saddam may be willing to 
leave most of kuwait in exchange for a disputed oil field on their 
border and a guarantee that western forces would not attack iraq 
us and british officials said they had heard nothing of the 
proposal reported by sky television news which quoted unnamed 
sources close to what it called negotiations between iraq and 
senior international mediators 
brent crude oil the british benchmark grade opened about 1 
lower then drifted slightly higher on january contracts as traders 
refused to respond strongly to the report 
theyve reacted in a very placid sort of way said geoff 
pyne an oil trader at ubs phillips and drew if the sky news 
report was believed by the markets it would have dropped three or 
four dollars 
the thing that was interesting about the sky report there 
seemed to be so much detail that it was too good to be true 
pyne said it could be some sort of a smoke screen to make the 
west think he saddam is going to pull out and it buys him time 
the sky news report jolted traders in new york shortly after the 
market closed on tuesday but it had apparently been discounted 
this morning at least until the cnn report was aired and the oil 
pit turned bearish

eight months after arriving at eastern airlines 
with the cold title of courtappointed trustee martin r shugrue 
has come to personify the company while taking a place in its 
tradition of colorful and controversial bosses 
shugrue enjoys obvious support and even admiration from 
employees at a carrier known for labormanagement strife hes also 
making new friends for eastern among travel agents and other key 
industry players and he admits has become something of a 
celebrity 
im no shrinking violet but i dont like being recognized on 
the street i cant go anywhere i cant have a private dinner in a 
restaurant shugrue said but its worked for us 
along the way though hes antagonized the eastern creditors by 
fighting off their push to liquidate the carrier 
and hes made few friends among union leaders who say he broke 
his promise to settle the disputes leading to the march 4 1989 
strike that nearly paralyzed eastern and pushed it into chapter 11 
bankruptcy five days later 
while easterns future remains very much in doubt shugrue at 
least has bought time for lastditch marketing efforts to take 
effect last month he persuaded the bankruptcy judge to release 
another 135 million from the companys escrow account which 
eastern says will pay operating costs through march 
an innovative 100 days advertising campaign and subsequent 
ads based on footage of shugrue talking with workers passengers 
and reporters has portrayed shugrue as a straighttalking magnetic 
leader some shugrue backers say hes succeeded in giving eastern a 
scrappy positive image 
americans always like an underdog said philip davidoff 
president of the american society of travel agents when you see 
an underdog really fighting for so long you say lets give them a 
chance 
his presence is probably the only thing thats kept the 
airline in business said helane becker airline analyst for 
shearson lehman brothers inc hes brought to the employees a 
sense of stability a sense of ability and clever insight 
shugrues personalized effort to save eastern has brought 
inevitable comparisons to the chrysler corp chairman 
hes out lee iacoccainglee iacocca davidoff said 
several employees mentioned the comparison in a recent mass 
meeting inside an eastern hangar 
if i could get 2 billion worth of federal loan guarantees 
id show you a turnaround shugrue replied referring to the 
government loans to the automaker in the early 1980s 
the employee meeting was a virtual lovefest with many of the 
workers questions just expressions of gratitude to shugrue 
we really feel hes out to save the company said 
reservations agent mario gomez 
james ashlock a vice president and 25year veteran of the 
airline said shugrue has for the first time given eastern a proud 
enthusiastic workforce that believes its management wants the same 
thing it does ashlocks past bosses at eastern included world war 
i flying ace eddie rickenbacker apollo astronaut frank borman and 
airline entrepreneur frank lorenzo who was replaced at the eastern 
helm by shugrue 
shugrue whose tenure also has seen the departure of some of 
easterns most unpopular executives claims he used a simple 
approach telling his managers to get out on the ramp and tell 
the people what you expect of them 
and i did it by example i went out and talked to employees 
he said i think when ceos get into a crisis situation the 
more visible they become in taking command of the crisis the more 
successful theyre going to be getting out of it 
theres no secrets no magic to it it may be leadership 101 
getting in front and leading 
however shugrue agreed his feelings about eastern are stronger 
than he would have ever expected the sunday last april when he came 
out of the shower in his houston home to take a telephone call from 
bankruptcy court examiner david shapiro at age 50 shugrue was 
heading a successful independent consulting group 
nonetheless shugrue was wellversed about easterns woes he 
was a pilot and longtime executive at pan american world airways 
and then president of continental airlines easterns parent which 
this past week sought federal bankruptcy protection 
taking over as trustee the same week as shapiros phone call 
shugrue said he quickly found easterns financial situation was 
even worse than he thought 
we were staggered by what we found a company bleeding to 
death horrible media liquidation stories advance bookings were 
zero longrange planning at eastern was tuesday 
but bankruptcy judge burton lifland in new york told shugrue he 
wanted eastern saved 
and a funny thing happened in a very short amount of time i 
fell in love with 18000 people shugrue said saying he was 
moved by the employees dedication and willingness to sacrifice 
whether shugrue would enjoy the same rapport with those who have 
been on strike 21 months seems doubtful but he said hed like to 
settle the labor disputes and insisted we can convert anybody 
shugrue from workingclass roots in providence ri says he 
has no antiunion bias 
the flight attendants and pilots unions ended their sympathy 
strikes more than a year ago most flight attendants are back at 
work but only 125 union pilots have been returned and the pilots 
union is battling shugrue in federal court to get more jobs back 
machinists union leader charles e bryan said shugrue who cited 
labor peace as a top priority when he was appointed has only 
gone through the motions of negotiating and really doesnt want to 
settle 
the machinists say they will continue picketing urging a 
boycott of eastern and challenging shugrue graffiti painted on an 
interstate 75 overpass north of miami complains shugrue makes 
35000 a month eastern loses 2 million a day is this anyway to 
run an airline 
meanwhile many airline analysts praise shugrue and his 
corporate rate strategy that lures business travelers with 
expanded firstclass service at discount fares however most are 
skeptical about whether eastern can survive during what appears to 
be an industry shakeout creditors attorney joel zweibel said they 
believe liquidation is inevitable 
shugrue plays down employee pleas for him to stay past his 
trusteeship he wont answer directly on whether he would stay on 
if asked by easterns new ownership when that comes 
although rarely in short supply of selfconfidence shugrue does 
at times seem surprised at how far hes come he chuckled when one 
listener at a fort lauderdale civic and business club asked whether 
he was interested in a screen career 
im just an unemployed pilot trying to sell some airplane 
tickets he replied

airline analysts were skeptical 
wednesday about plans by an iowa group to raise 15 billion to buy 
pan american world airways and move its headquarters to northeast 
iowa 
id give this a long shot at occurring said robert decker 
an analyst for duff amp phelps in chicago he said it would be nearly 
impossible to raise the money needed for the buyout especially in 
light of pan ams tottering finances 
a waterloobased investment group proposes to sell at least 
300000 bonds in 5000 denominations to buy pan am according to 
pan am airline capt neil sapp 51 of miami that would be 
equivalent to borrowing half the annual state budget for iowa 
speaking tuesday in waterloo at a luncheon attended by 175 
northeast iowa business and government officials sapp said the 
effort should not be taken lightly 
we would like to make a solid offer in january he said 
were not crazy were just innovative 
sapp and samual nodarse of cedar falls a retired university of 
northern iowa professor formed the iowa acquisition group and said 
they would buy the company on condition that its headquarters move 
from new york to waterloo 
were the white hats the good guys sapp said were not 
just someone who wants to buy it for its assets then run away from 
it with the profits from that 
he said money raised through the sale of bonds would be invested 
with iowa banks primarily in certificates of deposit with the 
interest used to pay off loans from investment bankers investors 
would get interest when bonds mature in nine years 
sapp predicted a very high probability of success 
spokeswoman pam hanlon at pan ams headquarters in new york said 
company policy is to decline comment on reports of mergers and 
acquisitions industry analysts disagreed with sapps prediction 
in todays market it would be difficult to raise that kind of 
money for an airline like pan am decker were in a period 
where debt markets are cautious and conservative 
theres not a lot of funds available nd pan am would 
certainly be a high risk company to do a buyout on at this stage 
he said 
thomas canning who follows airlines for standard amp poors corp 
in new york said selling the bonds might be difficult and i 
dont know what pan am might say about it theyve been looking for 
a buyer for two years and have not been able to make a deal 
i dont want to say theres no chance but its a little 
wild canning said its been difficult finding somebody 
interested in buying the whole company 
pan am has been losing money for years it recently agreed to 
sell key london routes and some other assets to chicagobased ual 
corp parent of united airlines for 400 million

crayola company officials might be 
turning a little red make that fuchsia with news that its top 
crayon maker is colorblind 
emerson moser who is retiring next week after 35 years isnt 
colorblind in the sense that he cant see color at all its just 
that some colors are confusing to him 
that means trying to spot the difference between a cadet blue 
and a blue green can make him feel well like a shrinking violet 
if you have a serious case of it you could foul up a lot of 
materials said moser 63 who has made a record 14 billion 
crayons his title at binney amp smith co the official name of the 
company that makes crayolas is a crayon molder 
as far as moser and the company can tell theres been no threat 
of children coloring the sky green and the grass blue unless they 
were doing their andy warhol imitations 
hes bluegreen colorblind but despite his handicap hes 
gone to the top of his trade said brad drexler spokesman for 
the eastonbased company 
moser has made seas of salmon pecks of plums and is a king 
crayon craftsman drexler said tuesday moser made yards of yellow 
and wednesday it was oodles of orange colors that give moser no 
trouble 
when you have shades of one color you get a little doubt 
about it before you go do anything you doublecheck yourself 
said moser 
its the second technicolor shock to come out of the crayola 
plant this year in august it retired eight traditional colors 
into the crayola hall of fame 
the company is asking moser to donate his final pair of 
anklehigh boots splashed with the waxy colorful remains of his 
time on the job for inclusion in the hall 
the colors splash a little bit when it comes out of the kettle 
into the bucket said moser people daily clean their shoes 
but i dont i have a multicolored pair of shoes its probably 
made them waterproof 
this pair i have now theres yellow on them because i 
worked yellow today and some orange and some red moser said in 
a telephone interview tuesday 
a company doctor detected mosers slight vision problem during a 
physical conducted when he was hired oct 12 1953 as a floor boy 
in the packing department 
its so slight that if the doctor wouldnt have tested me i 
probably would have never noticed it moser said 
less than two years later moser graduated to the most colorful 
job in the world pouring molten wax into 2400crayon molds nearly 
100 times a day once the wax is set crayons are flicked out of 
the racks and stacked in a bin for a conveyor belt to carry them to 
a labeling machine 
at crayola there are subtle shades of everything 
but can anyone over age 12 really tell the difference between 
violet and blue violet cornflower and navy blue blue green and 
cadet blue sepia and brown orchid and thistle or mulberry and 
red violet 
other colors to worry about are the new shades of cerulean a 
type of blue dandelion fuchsia jungle green royal purple teal 
blue vivid tangerine and wild strawberry they replaced blue gray 
green blue lemon yellow maize orange red orange yellow raw 
umber and violet blue last summer 
for less than obvious reasons moser likes the eight basic 
crayola colors black white red yellow green blue brown and 
orange he even liked the eight retired colors which now are 
remembered only in 5foottall models at the hall of fame 
but moser says there is no reason to wax nostalgic about 
retiring the crayon colors 
the new ones are nice they really stand out when you color 
with them moser said the other colors were nice too you 
grew up with them and got used to them but you cant survive on 
sentiment sentiment doesnt keep a company moving forward

factory orders for manufactured goods bounced 
up 28 percent in october the government reported wednesday but 
analysts said the jump mostly was due to the transportation sector 
and the higher cost of oil 
the october numbers are about as good as the factory orders 
are going to look for awhile said economist robert brusca of 
nikko securities co international in new york like many analysts 
he believes the economy is in a recession 
the strength was mostly in aircraft and in nondurable price 
increases added cynthia latta an economist with drimcgrawhill 
in lexington mass i dont see any reason to become particularly 
hopeful on the basis of this report 
the commerce department said orders for both durable and 
nondurable goods totaled a seasonally adjusted 2507 billion 
after a revised 02 percent decline the previous month the 
revision showed september orders even weaker than the 01 percent 
gain initially reported 
transportation orders jumped 148 percent to 379 billion 
reflecting gains in both the aircraft and automobile industries 
but aircraft orders tend to be volatile and analysts pointed to 
reports that car production was falling at the end of november 
discounting transportation orders rose just a modest 09 
percent noted economist thomas runiewicz of the wefa group in 
bala cynwyd pa 
factory orders are a key economic barometer of the manufacturing 
industry a decrease may forecast a slump in that sector and future 
job layoffs 
durable goods products like autos that are expected to last 
more than three years were up 39 percent to 1298 billion after 
dropping 16 percent in september and 09 percent in august 
but brusca said october total still was below the 1317 billion 
level reached last december and added the orders situation is 
really pretty bleak 
indeed a survey by the national association of purchasing 
management on monday said its index of new manufacturing orders 
dropped to 394 percent in november the lowest level since it 
stood at 381 percent in may 1982 during the last recession 
fortythree percent of the purchasing managers surveyed said 
their firms had fewer new orders in november only 18 percent said 
their orders increased and 39 percent said they were unchanged from 
october 
nondurable goods orders rose 16 percent to 1209 billion 
with the largest increase in petroleum refining the department 
said the price of oil bounced above 40 a barrel at one point 
during october but since has fallen back 
one possible bright spot was in the key category of nonmilitary 
capital goods often a barometer of business investment plans 
orders there gained 87 percent to 416 billion following a 68 
percent advance in september 
the oftenvolatile defense orders fell for the second straight 
month down 94 percent to 71 billion following a 61 percent 
decline a month earlier excluding the defense component orders 
were up 32 percent 
orders for other durable goods included primary metals up 55 
percent to 120 billion and electrical machinery up 31 percent 
to 198 billion but nonelectrical machinery orders were down 15 
percent to 222 billion 
inventories inched up 01 percent to 3773 billion shipments 
gained 17 percent to 2475 billion and unfilled orders were up 
06 percent to 5225 billion

wednesday as foreign exchange traders anxiously watched the middle 
east situation and the us economy 
gold prices declined 
the markets are still very nervous about peace war peace 
war and the dollar has fluctuated accordingly said robert ryan 
corporate foreign exchange manager with bank of new york co 
the dollar advanced against most major currrencies in europe 
after secretary of state james baker reiterated demands for iraqs 
withdrawal from kuwait 
baker told the senate foreign relations committee the united 
states would strike suddenly massively and decisively if 
military force is needed to remove iraqi troops from kuwait 
the dollar has gained in recent weeks amid signs that middle 
east tensions were increasing but it has also fallen as those 
tensions seemed to dissipate or as the markets had second thoughts 
about how serious the situation really is 
the dollar generally advances during times of international 
turmoil because some investors view it as a safehaven currency 
but the dollar was held down wednesday by the faltering us 
economy and the belief that interest rates in this country will 
fall 
a federal reserve survey released wednesday showed the economy 
in all regions of the country was either declining or growing 
sluggishly at the end of last month 
traders believe the fed will be forced to lower interest rates 
that would be a negative for the dollar which like all currencies 
is supported by higher rates 
in new york trading the dollar advanced against the british 
pound and the japanese yen 
sterling fell to 19260 in new york from 192925 late tuesday 
in earlier london trading the pound fell to 19225 from 19350 
the pound is also facing the prospects of lower interest rates 
the dollar rose to 133625 yen in new york from 13330 late 
tuesday in tokyo overnight the dollar fell 093 yen to 13342 
yen and it was quoted later in london at a higher rate of 13395 
yen 
the japanese economy is seen as particularly vulnerable should 
war break out in the midle east and disrupt oil supplies japan 
imports nearly all its oil 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with late 
tuesdays prices included 149925 german marks down from 15030 
12795 swiss francs down from 12825 50770 french francs down

eastman kodak co is talking with several 
companies about forming a joint venture with its sterling drug 
subsidiary officials said wednesday 
kodak spokesman paul allen confirmed that french pharmaceutical 
giant sanofi sa is among the companies with which kodak is 
negotiating 
sterling has been talking to several companies about an 
alliance and sanofi is a company that sterling is talking to 
but allen said no agreement had been reached and theres no 
assurance that any will he would not comment on other companies 
with which sterling is talking or what kind of joint venture is 
being sought 
sterling makes bayer aspirin phillips milk of magnesia midol 
pain relievers and other overthecounter products its 
bestselling prescription drug is omnipaque which highlights body 
organs during xrays and cat scans 
kodak acquired sterling for 51 billion in 1988 hoping the 
drug company would help offset sluggish growth in the photography 
business analysts have expressed dissatisfaction with sterlings 
failure to produce new drugs or the kind of profits kodak had 
expected 
but allen said the negotiations do not reflect unhappiness with 
sterlings performance 
theyre right on target their performance is right on plan 
he said we said they would be contributing to the cash flow by 
the end of 1989 and they are 
kodak president kay whitmore has said the company wont sell 
sterling or buy another pharmaceutical company but would look for 
other ways to improve sterlings performance 
the wall street journal reported wednesday that sources close to 
the talks said an agreement between sanofi and sterling could be 
reached by the end of the year allen would not comment on a 
timetable for the talks 
the newspaper said a number of other pharmaceutical companies 
may be considering a joint venture with sterling including f 
hoffmannla roche amp co cibageigy ag and sandoz ag all based in 
switzerland bayer ag of germany and rhonepoulenc sa of france 
if sterling and sanofi create a joint venture sterling probably 
would market a number of sanofi drugs in the united states and at 
the same time get a larger share of overseas markets the journal 
said 
the newspaper said sanofi which is 60 percent owned by frances 
statecontrolled elf aquitaine oil company has been looking for a 
us distribution network to launch several drugs in the mid1990s

opecs crude oil production was down 12 percent 
in november from levels before iraq invaded kuwait the 
international energy agency reported wednesday 
the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting countries 
produced 229 million barrels a day in november despite the un 
embargo against oil produced by iraq and kuwait both opec members 
the agency said in a report released in london 
the november figure was 300000 barrels per day less than in 
july just before the iraqi invasion and up 600000 barrels a day 
from october the report said 
the iea said that among opec producers saudi arabias output 
was 79 millions of barrels a day an increase of about 300000 
barrels a day over october 
iran boosted production to 33 million barrels a day up 400000 
barrels a day from october the report said 
iraq produced 400000 barrels a day and kuwait prodced 100000 
barrels a day despite the worldwide ban on importing oil from the 
two countries 
the parisbased organization said increases in production came 
from greater output in heavier highsulphur grades 
world oil supplies outside countries with centrally planned 
economies totaled 538 million barrels a day in november up from 
the revised october total of 532 million barrels a day the iea 
said 
that was the second monthly rise since levels were depressed in 
august and september following iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 
2 
production in western countries that are members of the 
24nation organization for economic cooperation and development 
rose slightly to 161 million barrels a day mostly from increases 
in north sea and australian output oil producers within the oecd 
include the united states britain and norway 
soviet oil exports suffered a largerthanexpected seasonal 
drop after averaging about 17 million barrels a day during the 
first nine months of the year soviet crude exports to the oecd 
countries have dropped to about 14 million barrels a day since 
september the agency reported 
the iea said the normal seasonal drop of soviet exports to the 
oecd in the fourth quarter of the year to meet rising winter 
domestic demand was this year reinforced by falling output and a 
drop in deliveries to eastern europe caught in a hard currency 
crunch 
soviet deliveries to all destinations from the black sea ports 
in october were at the lowest level since january and early 
indications suggest a further fall to less than 09 million barrels 
a day in november the agency said 
outside the oecd the iea expects oil consumption to average 
153 million barrels a day up from 1989s level of 147 million 
barrels a day it projects oil consumption for the world outside 
the centrally planned economy countries to average 531 million 
barrels a day an increase of 800000 barrels a day from its 1989 
level

gold futures prices plunged wednesday on new yorks commodity 
exchange on perceptions that developments favor a negotiated 
settlement of the crisis caused by iraqs occupation of kuwait 
also helping to push gold lower was the steep plunge in crude 
oil prices with the january contract down 337 a barrel 
on other markets grains and soybeans fell and livestock and 
pork futures climbed 
gold prices began their plunge on reports from paris that french 
foreign minister randolph dumas said the permanent members of the 
un security council would meet soon to discuss a mideast peace 
plan 
an announcement by the state department that iraq accepted 
president bushs offer to hold talks on the persian gulf crisis 
reinforced peace sentiments 
perception that developments in middle east favor negotiation 
rather than otherwise sent gold prices down sharply said bette 
raptopoulos an analyst with prudential bache securities inc in 
new york 
ms raptopoulos said the possibility of a peaceful solution to 
the crisis sent crude oil prices plunging adding to the selloff in 
gold 
investors usually buy gold during periods of uncertainty because 
its value is universally accepted 
ms raptopoulos noted that platinum and silver suffered minor 
losses 
the end of a war situation will be good for platinum and 
silver because those are industrial metal she said 
gold settled 460 to 480 lower with the contract for delivery 
in february at 37580 a troy ounce silver was 3 cents to 6 cents 
lower with march at 4238 a troy ounce 
crude oil prices plunged on new yorks mercantile exchange on 
word of the various diplomatic moves 
analysts said oil prices also were influenced by reports from 
energy experts of ample supply of oil in coming months and they 
say a report expected from the organization of petroleum exporting 
counties indicating demand for oil will decline in coming months 
added to the bearish tone of the market 
light sweet crude was 84 cents to 337 lower with january at 
2729 a barrel heating oil was 4 cents to 576 cents lower with 
january at 8114 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 455 cents 
to 708 cents lower with january at 6884 cents a gallon 
grain and soybean futures prices closed lower on the chicago 
board of trade as concern over the lack of progress in the trade 
and tariff talks depressed the market 
the lack of export business to the soviet union also weighed on 
the market said dan cekander an analyst with rodman amp renshaw 
inc in chicago 
the market had been pumped up over all the talk of extending 
credits to the russians he said the market remains 
optimistic it will happen but it has settled back to wait 
the extension of a us credit package would allow the soviet 
union to buy badly needed grain paul dickerson the agriculture 
departments general sales manager said wednesday the decision on 
whether to grant export credit guarantees to the soviets is still 
under review 
cekander said there also was concern the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade negotiations under way in brussels could 
collapse the main obstacle is the demand by the united states and 
other countries that the european community reduce farm subsidies 
analysts say a breakdown of the talks scheduled to end this 
week could result in a world trade war which would hurt us farm 
exports 
wheat was a cent to 1 cents lower with december at 243 a 
bushel corn was 1 cent lower to a cents higher with december at 
227 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 2 cents lower with december 
at 110 a bushel soybeans were 2 cents to 9 cents lower with 
january at 592 a bushel 
livestock futures climbed on the chicago mercantile exchange as 
cash prices held firm while pork futures were higher on the 
perception that tuesdays sharp selloff was overdone 
live cattle were unchanged to 47 cents higher with december at 
7907 cents a pound feeder cattle were unchanged to 40 cent 
higher with january at 8772 cents a pound live hogs were 10 cent

attorneys prepared an emergency appeal wednesday to 
keep thrift regulators from seeking a 308 million bond from 
ousted centrust chairman david paul a symbol of wasteful opulence 
in the savings amp loan crisis 
paul whose lavish ways propelled him into the public eye has 
been a target of regulators since they took over floridas onetime 
largest thrift in february at an estimated loss of 18 billion 
the office of thrift supervision which charged that paul 
surrounded himself with luxury to satisfy his insatiable greed 
and vanity sought the huge bond to prevent him from squandering 
money from the failed centrust 
the government initially set a nov 1 deadline for payment of 
the bond but paul won some time by challenging the administrative 
order in us district court his arguments were rejected tuesday 
and ots set a new deadline of noon thursday 
but steve davis a paul attorney said wednesday that an appeal 
was being prepared for the 11th us circuit court of appeals in 
atlanta 
pauls attorneys charged the government was forcing him to pay 
restitution without a way to defend himself against claims he used 
bank funds for his personal use but us district judge edward 
davis rejected those arguments 
the judge upheld the application of the 1989 sampl bailout law 
against paul rejected arguments that ots was improperly pursuing 
enforcement actions without benefit of due process or trial and 
cited an important governmental interest in protecting 
depositors interests 
the ruling is clear the constitutional arguments were 
completely without merit ots attorney faith hochberg said in a 
telephone interview from jersey city nj we believe it was a 
proper order from the beginning and have followed proper judicial 
proceedings throughout 
ots wants paul to post the 308 million bond file an 
accounting of his assets and seek ots approval of any change of 
personal assets involving 5000 or more 
among questionable centrust spending cited by ots are a 15 
million legal defense fund for thrift officers and directors 
centrusts sumptuously appointed 47story office tower in downtown 
miami old masters paintings and a private dinner cooked by 
european chefs flown in for the occasion

so far the country has been lucky there have 
been viruses worms logic bombs trojan horses and other computer 
scams but no successful systematic attempt to subvert the systems 
that are so essential to modern society 
however says an expert on computer security there is reason 
to believe our luck may soon run out unless we take action now 
a committee of the national research council spent 1 years 
looking into the state of computer security and found systems and 
information in danger and society in turn at risk it issued a 
300page report wednesday titled computers at risk 
we have in many cases left computer systems unprotected from a 
wide variety of current and future threats to their integrity 
committee chairman david d clark told a news conference 
national computing and communications systems are vulnerable 
to potentially catastrophic ecurity breaches and accidental 
failures he said contending that the nation has been lucky he 
said the committee concludes that tomorrow will not be like 
yesterday 
horrible examples abound 
for 10 months in the mid1980s a west german nicknamed wily 
hacker attacked 450 computers operated by the us military and 
its contractors successfully gaining access to 30 he allegedly 
had ties to the soviet kgb the nrc report says and it was assumed 
he was looking for sensitive data 
in 1988 a worm paralyzed thousands of computers in the 
internet a network that links 60000 computer systems used in 
university and other research robert morris of arnold md is 
appealing his conviction in federal court for unleashing the 
program 
a software design error froze much of american telephone amp 
telegraphs long distance network 
the german chaos computer club broke into the nasa space 
physics analysis network 
an error in computer software controlling a radiation therapy 
machine a therac 25 linear accelerator resulted in at least three 
patient deaths 
more than 26000 diskettes that featured aids prevention 
information but were infected with a hidden computer virus were 
mailed to hospitals businesses and government agencies worldwide 
there have been thousands of reported virus attacks and hundreds 
of different viruses identified such as stoned devils dance 
1260 jerusalem yankee doodle pakistani brain icelandic2 ping 
pong and december 24 the committee said 
a virus is a computer program usually hidden that attaches 
itself to other programs and has the ability to reproduce itself 
viruses generally are trojan horse programs which when 
executed result in undesired side effects unexpected by the user 
logic bombs are trojan horses activated by a particular event 
in the computer perhaps even the occurrence of a particular date 
a worm is a program that distributes itself in multiple 
copies within a system or into connected systems a worm attack 
might exploit security vulnerabilities in a system or cause denial 
of service to the computer user 
clark said the committee which had 16 members from 
universities industry computer manufacturers and security firms 
is concerned about a blase attitude among most in the us business 
community 
many people still use easytoguess passwords such as their 
first name or they use common english words that can be guessed 
by a determined hacker with a computerized dictionary he said 
attacks based on these weaknesses are commonplace today 
the committee recommended six key actions a major one being 
creation of a private nonprofit organization to develop system 
security principles supporting research maintain a tracking 
system of threats and foster training of computer security agents 
the modern thief can steal more with a computer than with a 
gun the nrc report says tomorrows terrorist may be able to 
do more damage with a keyboard than with a bomb 
thus far we have relied on the absence of malicious people who 
are both capable and motivated we can no longer do so we must 
instead attempt to build computer systems that are secure and 
trustworthy

a federal jury began deliberations wednesday but 
reached no verdict in the bank fraud trial of don r dixon who 
owned the texas savings and loan that was one of the first costly 
failures of the thrift crisis 
vernon savings association collapsed in 1987 at a cost to 
taxpayers of more than 12 billion 
dixon who owned vernon from 1981 to 1986 was charged in 38 
counts with misusing thousands f dollars of the thrifts money for 
political contributions a california beach home and prostitutes 
the combined charges carried a maximum penalty of up to 190 years 
in prison and fines of up to 95 million 
in closing arguments attorneys on both sides urged jurors to 
focus on legal questions presented in the case not on the savings 
and loan crisis 
us district judge a joe fish then read more than 40 pages of 
instructions before the eightwoman fourman jury began 
considering more than five weeks of testimony the jury was out 
part of the afternoon before quitting deliberations for the day 
government attorneys portrayed dixon as a master manipulator 
of vernon and its employees assistant us attorney david jarvis 
told jurors the case was a classic story of power and wealth that 
caused don dixon to lose his moral bearings 
dixon schemed and used sham documents to render the disputed 
dealings unaccountable to regulators and its board of directors 
jarvis said if these are legitimate deals why wouldnt dixon 
put them on the table he asked 
defense attorney billy ravkind said prosecutors through their 
choice of witnesses had embraced people even a child would know 
are lying 
he called the governments investigation of dixon sloppy and 
said it focused on a few minor transactions in a 
multibilliondollar business 
the 38count indictment was a script that prosecutors had to 
act out ravkind said 
jarvis said dixons defense focused on which drawers from the 
cash register the thrift owner got his money 
whats he doing in the register what is don dixon doing 
tapping vernons till the prosecutor asked 
government attorneys brought more than 20 witnesses to the stand 
and introduced hundreds of documents over four weeks dixon and a 
handful of others testified in his defense during the last week 
dixon testified that vernon employees were responsible for the 
crimes for which he is accused he said he had no knowledge of 
illegal activity at the thrift 
dixon said the beach house near san diego was used as a hotel by 
the thrifts owners he said he knew escorts were hired for parties 
attended by vernon officers and borrowers at the house but said he 
did not know who paid for them 
in testimony about trips on which thrift officers took linton 
bowman former commissioner of the texas savings and loan 
department dixon said he helped arrange for a female vernon 
employee to be a date for bowman providing the date was probably 
inappropriate but at the time i did not think so dixon 
testified

the discussions are on the verge of breaking down 
it is a stalemate and it is serious said a grimfaced us 
trade representative carla hills 
officials said there would be another effort at a breakthrough 
thursday 
high noon is tomorrow thursday said canadian trade 
minister john crobie if there is no change then it is over 
the trade ministers emerged just before midnight from a twohour 
meeting in which they sought in vain for a compromise position on 
the expensive subsidies that developed countries pay to their 
farmers 
an indian official commerce minister subramanian swamy was 
pessimistic saying it looks like they are heading for 
suspension 
if the talks are broken off even for a brief time it would put 
the entire fouryear effort at trade reform in jeopardy because of 
the tight deadlines negotiators had faced to submit a completed 
document to the us congress 
the dispute pitted the 12nation european community against much 
of the rest of the world including large farm exporters such as 
the united states brazil and argentina 
european officials had been expected wednesday to agree to at 
least a modest expansion of their offer to reduce internal farm 
support payments by 30 percent 
instead the europeans emerged from their separate meeting 
saying they had decided to make no further offer on farm subsidies 
until the united states made compromises on other issues 
there had also been hope that the european position might change 
as a result of a meeting wednesday night in paris between german 
chancellor helmut kohl and french president francois mitterrand 
but following that discussion no new offer was announced 
crosbie described the mood inside the discussions as somber 
and said the meeting thursday would determine whether there was any 
point in continuing the talks 
we are going to have to decide whether we are going to give it 
all up or not he said 
the farm subsidy fight evolved as the biggest stumbling block to 
conclusion of the most ambitious round of trade liberalization 
talks ever undertaken the negotiations known as the uruguay round 
for the country where they began in 1986 had been scheduled to 
wrap up friday after five days of marathon bargaining 
but after three days the talks remained stalemated and some 
delegations talked openly about the possibility of giving up and 
going home 
the united states has got to recognize that this is a 
negotiation between equals not a group of people to be pushed 
around in this way said british agriculture secretary john 
gummer 
otto schlecht germanys deputy economics minister said we 
have no reason to go to the americans on our knees 
gummer said the europeans had insisted on american compromise 
offers in areas including trade in services textiles and 
investment to be made at the same time that discussions went 
forward on the farm issue he said the us side had rejected that 
proposal 
us officials said the europeans were engaging in a desperate 
attempt to shift the blame for failure of the negotiations 
what is holding up the negotiations here is that the european 
community has not yet provided a proposal on agriculture us 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said 
the european community entered the negotiations offering to trim 
domestic farm support payments by 30 percent the united states 
supported by major farm exporting countries was seeking much 
deeper cuts of 75 percent in domestic supports and import barriers 
and a 90 percent cut in export subsidies 
the trade talks the eighth in a series of negotiations dating 
to 1947 offered the promise of lowering prices for consumers while 
at the same time boosting economic prosperity especially in third 
world countries with farmbased economies 
the united states has argued that without sufficient progress in 
agriculture developed nations will not be able to win concessions 
from third world countries to reform their trade practices 
including agreement on tough new rules to protect against copyright 
piracy something that costs american businesses an estimated 60 
billion in lost sales annually 
negotiators spoke pessimistically about a failure of the talks 
which many fear could trigger a rise of protectionism and global 
trade wars similar to the events of the 1930s that were blamed for 
making the great depression more severe 
anyone who does not admit that the round is in deep crisis is 
just deluding themselves said australian trade minister neal 
blewett

thomson consumer electronics said wednesday 
it was raising factory prices on rca nd ge brand color television 
sets bigscreen tvs and camcorders because of increased fuel costs 
and a weak dollar 
the company said the 3 percent price hike would take effect in 
february it blamed on rising oil and gasoline costs from the 
persian gulf crisis and the decline in the value of the dollar 
against foreign currencies for the increase 
thomson said the cost of materials purchased in japan and europe 
have risen sharply because of the weak dollar which makes it more 
costly to buy foreignmade materials 
thomson is suffering tens of millions of dollars in annual 
costs that are not reflected in todays pricing structure said 
martin j holleran chief executive of thomsons sales and 
marketing coamericas 
rising energy costs have adversely affected the costs of 
transportation and raw materials such as glass plastics and chips 
he said 
holleran said unit sales of color television models are 
declining and the prospects for future growth in the smaller screen 
sizes are limited industry growth is focused on larger screen 
models as consumers seek a theater environment in the home he 
said 
while manufacturing costs have climbed color tv prices in the

eaglepicher industries inc announced a 
tentative agreement wednesday to pay 460 million over 20 years to 
victims of asbestos disease but plaintiffs lawyers rejected the 
plan as too small 
eaglepicher faces 65000 claims by workers made ill inhaling 
asbestos fibers in a key case in the attempt to clear a nationwide 
court backlog stemming from liability over the cancercausing 
mineral 
cincinnatibased eaglepicher said it reached agreement with two 
of four lawyers appointed by us district judge jack b weinstein 
in new york to negotiate a settlement with the company 
last month some plaintiffs lawyers rejected a proposal that 
offered a reported 500 million to victims over the same time 
period and the same attorneys said they would oppose the new 
proposal 
under the plan eaglepicher would create an independent trust 
to resolve asbestos claims the company would contribute 30 
million in the first year 20 million per year for the next nine 
years and 25 million per year in the following 10 years the plan 
would take effect in november 1993 
in addition the trust would receive preferred stock that could 
be converted after five years into 25 percent of eaglepicher 
common stock if the companys meets the payment plan and 50 
percent if it does not 
eaglepicher also would set aside 675 percent of its net sales 
each year to provide for basic operations 
a hearing was scheduled for friday on eaglepichers request 
that weinstein declare a classaction to resolve the claims on 
grounds the company cannot meet its asbestos liabilities 
a similar request has been made by the manville trust fund the 
nations largest asbestos resolution facility which faces about 
130000 claims but has run out of money to settle new cases a 
proposal to restructure the trust is pending dozens of other 
former asbestos users are watching the cases closely 
peter angelos one of the four plaintiffs lawyers appointed by 
weinstein to negotiate with eaglepicher said the latest proposal 
wasnt even worthy of consideration 
the obligations of the company are minimal in relation to the 
number of persons who have sustained serious injury by way of 
occupational exposure to its products the baltimore attorney 
said 
the plan was backed by attorneys david shapiro of new york who 
is representing future claimants and stanley chesley of 
cincinnati who was added to the negotiating group only last month 
angelos said he and the fourth attorney henry g miller of new 
york were not consulted about the plan announced by eaglepicher 
this proposal is millions of dollars less and has millions 
less in value than one rejected last month angelos said he 
placed the present value of the proposal at under 200 million and 
the companys potential total potential liabilities at more than 1 
billion 
a spokesman for eaglepicher could not be reached for comment 
chesley defended the plan saying that the 460 million fund 
combined with 45 million to pay previously negotiated claims and 
and estimated 178 million from the companys net sales make it 
worth well over 600 million 
he said the tentative eaglepicher settlement will protect 
plaintiffs if the company has to seek bankruptcy court protection 
this is a combination of cash money guaranteed income and 
equity he said thats a plus 
the company has been inundated with lawsuits from people who say 
they suffered cancer and respiratory problems from exposure to an 
asbestosbased pipe sealant the company made primarily for ships 
from 1934 to 1971 
eaglepicher has said it faces insolvency if it does not settle 
the claims and said in a statement wednesday that liquidity will 
continue to be a serious concern for the next several months the 
company also said it would seek to sell some assets and receive 
accommdations from lenders for a period 
eaglepicher has said it has paid more than 500 million in 
settlements and legal fees asbestos defendants want claims be made 
class actions to reduce legal fees they say are exhausting assets 
that otherwise could be used to compensate victims
