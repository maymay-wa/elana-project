a federal judge wednesday temporarily 
halted logging on five timber tracts that is being contested by 
conservationists seeking to preserve the northern spotted owl in 
western oregon 
us district judge helen fryes temporary restraining order came 
in response to a motion filed tuesday by environmental groups 
fighting the federal bureau of land managements plans to log mature 
forests near spotted owl nests 
bob rivers acting bureau of land management state director said 
its district representatives had been told to notify logging 
companies to cease operations as soon as possible a sixth tract 
affected by the judges order has not yet been awarded 
the bureau of land management in reckless disregard for the 
spotted owl selected these six timber sales as a target of 
opportunity to make their point through chainsaw justice said 
wendell wood of the oregon natural resources council one of the 
plaintiffs 
rivers would not comment on woods remarks 
meanwhile in seattle nine conservation groups sued the us 
forest service wednesday to try to stop logging on publicly owned 
stands of oldgrowth timber that are habitat for the northern 
spotted owl 
the environmental groups contend a forest service plan for 
spotted owls doesnt protect the species the plan approved in 
december said 374000 acres of mature and oldgrowth timber in 13 
national forests in the pacific northwest should be designated as 
owl habitat that is in addition to the wilderness areas and other 
tracts protected from logging 
the northern spotted owl lives in the remnants of the pacific 
northwests ancient oldgrowth forests the fish and wildlife 
service is being challenged in court over its 1987 refusal to 
designate the owl a threatened or endangered species 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals in san francisco earlier 
this month lifted an injunction it earlier imposed on cutting timber 
near spotted owl nests on bureau of land management land in western 
oregon the appeals court sent the case back to fryes court a 
request to reinstate the injunction is pending before frye 
on wednesday frye set a feb 17 hearing on that motion 
in response to the appeals courts injunction the bureau of land 
management cut its projected timber harvest on the former oregon amp 
california railroad lands it manages in western oregon by about 25 
percent the blm announced the six timber tracts after the 
injunction was lifted

the guardian angels say that with the backing of 
the director of two charles bronson movies and a british businessman 
they will start training recruits in london next week despite 
official opposition 
curtis sliwa leader of the new yorkbased group that wants to 
send civilian patrols into the london underground had threatened to 
abandon the plan unless the crimefighting group could find training 
space 
he said police and some government officials had dug their 
heels in and refused to allow the angels to train in public places 
police and lawmakers have said law enforcement on the subways 
should be left to professionals not civilians 
after discussing the angels plight on a highly popular british 
broadcasting co television talk show sliwa said wednesday that he 
had received two offers of help from bill fagan owner of a chain 
of public recital halls throughout london and from director michael 
winner 
winner directed death wish and death wish ii both 
starring bronson as a tough vigilante who settles the score with 
coldblooded criminals 
sliwa said fagan offered the angels the use of a hall evenings 
with no strings attached for a threemonth training course and 
winner guaranteed that if there were any problems he would pay for 
a training facility 
it gives us a mandate to continue sliwa said 
the guardian angels had also received hundreds of calls from 
people who offered gardens rooms attics and backyards for 
training sliwa said 
he said 60 young people onethird of them women had applied to 
become angels and would on monday begin a training program in basic 
selfdefense first aid performing citizens arrests and human 
relations 
were going to give it a go for the three months of training 
and hopefully by early may be able to produce a guardian angel unit 
of young men and young women from the greater london area to go down 
into the underground and give you a permanent regular presence of 
guardian angels he said 
supporters of the angels say a sharp rise in assaults and 
robberies in londons subway system indicate the 22 million 
passengers who use it every day cant be protected without deploying 
many more uniformed police 
the guardian angels who turn 10 years old on monday became 
famous for patroling new yorks subways and have branched out into 
60 cities in the united states canada and mexico

several government and university 
scientists contend a recent series of newspaper stories exaggerated 
the threat to humans from selenium in food 
executive editor gregory favre of the sacramento bee which 
published the series on dec 45 said the newspaper was confident 
of the accuracy of our reporting and of our analysis 
the critics are led by richard jacobs of the us food and drug 
administration and gerhard schrauzer a chemistry professor at the 
university of california at san diego who said the bee stories 
needlessly raised fears concerning the safety of the foods we eat 
 
the stories summarized in an account distributed to papers 
nationwide by the associated press said selenium had been found in 
food from supermarkets across the nation at levels high enough to 
slowly poison millions of highrisk americans such as the very 
young the old and the chronically ill 
schrauzer criticized the stories for reporting doubtful data on 
the selenium levels of common foods and grossly exaggerating the 
toxicity of selenium 
selenium a natural element in soil is essential to life in 
small concentrations but can be toxic at higher levels 
reports contending that millions of americans are at risk of 
selenium poisoning are unfounded and irresponsible schrauzer 
said as are the claims that the foods regularly consumed by 
americans contain unsafe levels of the element 
the bee reported that illnesses ranging from stomach upsets to 
death occurred in rural western residents who had been exposed to 
significant amounts of selenium the newspaper said that at least 
one person an oregon rancher died of the disease while others 
suffered paralysis loss of hair skin rashes hypertension and 
other maladies attributable to selenium 
favre said the newspaper believes its stories were accurate and 
hopes that the fda and other government agencies will not turn 
their backs on a potential health hazard because of any dispute 
over the bees data 
the laboratories the bee used in the testing process are 
recognized by many states as among the finest labs for this type of 
test we are confident that the results they found and which we 
published are accurate 
the bee said it hired private laboratories to study the selenium 
content in foods in dry weight form with all moisture removed 
the newspaper then figured average daily intake by translating the 
dry weights into equivalents of fresh foods as they would be 
consumed 
the scientists criticizing those articles have focused 
principally on the calculations which the bee used to translate the 
dry weights into average meals rather than on the selenium levels 
found in tests conducted for the bee 
bee reporter tom harris who wrote the stories defended the use 
of dryweight calculations saying there has been a dramatic 
evolution in the scientific communitys opinions on which system 
to use and that the onceuniversal wetweight method is giving way 
to the more scientifically accurate dryweight system 
a major problem with wetweight calculations harris said is 
that they lead to underestimation of intake 
but thomas jukes a biophysics professor at uc berkeley who says 
he participated in the discovery that selenium was essential to 
life said the stories need to be scrutinized and revised based on 
the actual content of selenium in foods which they miscalculated 
anna fan chief of the state department of health services 
office of food toxicology in berkeley also said the bees 
assessment of dietary selenium intake is not consistent with 
scientific literature for the last 10 to 15 years 
jacobs supervising chemist of the federal fdas san francisco 
office said the bees conclusions were without scientific merit 
there is no evidence to suggest millions of people are getting 
too much selenium in their diet jacobs said 
the primary problem with the story he said was not the bees 
data but its misleading interpretation of that data 
the story used an example of a person eating 6 ounces of dry eggs 
in a meal implying that 6 ounces would be a normal serving jacobs 
said but the fresh equivalent of 6 ounces is 11 extralarge eggs a 
10fold exaggeration of what someone would consume at a typical 
meal he said 
similar reductions in calculated intakes can be made for other 
foods from the bee article jacobs said 
harris said he based the formula for determining how much someone 
would consume in dryweight equivalents on information gathered from 
several credible scientists and nutritionists and that his data 
indicates that 6 ounces dry weight would equal 2 to 3 extra large 
fresh eggs 
however nutritionist joanne ikeda of uc berkeley who was not 
consulted by the bee and is not among critics who have come forward 
said that 6 ounces of dry eggs are equivalent to 12 extralarge 
fresh eggs

the plaza hotel was in for a jolt when four 
mopheads from liverpool settled in a 12th floor suite for a short 
winters stay in february 1964 
they dove into room service jampb scotch with cocacola they 
binged on jam butties butter and jelly sandwiches corn flakes 
and ice cream and left bowls full of stubbed out ciggies the 
first morning 37 sacks of mail arrived and girls 
lots of girls 
screaming screeching silly schoolchildren who would kill their 
grandmothers for a glimpse of john paul george and ringo 
the lasses dressed as chambermaids and tried to sneak into the 
suite they posed as record company representatives anything they 
stormed the hotels revolving doors only to be dumped 
unceremoniously on the street with legions of their shrieking 
sisters 
it was the first magical mystery tour for the beatles they 
landed at kennedy airport on feb 7 to make their legendary first 
appearance on the ed sullivan show on feb 9 
for 15 days the country became inflamed with beatlemania and it 
would be years before the fever would die down 
they were cocky and sure at their news conferences at one john 
lennon was asked how much money he expected to earn during the tour 
his response about half a crown depends on the tax how much 
have you got and to what did they owe their success good press 
agent john replied 
ringo starr was asked what he thought of beethoven his reply 
great specially his poems 
it was a lark 
no one at that moment realized the rich gift and legacy to emerge 
from the four musicians they went on to sell more than any group in 
pop history indeed after their appearance on the ed sullivan 
show the beatles sold 25 million records in the united states in 
less than a month 
lennon is dead now shot outside his manhattan apartment building 
on dec 8 1980 
george harrison lives with his second wife olivia and 
9yearold son dhani in a fortresslike gothic mansion with spires 
and turrets at henleyonthames in western england he has lived out 
of the limelight for nearly 20 years but reemerged somewhat in 1987 
to give his first full concert in 15 years in july at wembley arena 
and to record a hit single got my mind set on you which topped 
the us cash box music chart in january 1988 
he also has recorded with bob dylan roy orbison and tom petty in 
a tongueincheek group known as the traveling wilburys and he is 
coowner and an executive producer of the independent british film 
company handmade films the missionary life of brian 
starr spent five weeks in an american alcoholism clinic last fall 
with his wife actress barbara bach they live in a secluded estate 
near ascot in southern england he became the first beatle 
grandfather when his 20yearold son zak starkey eldest of three 
children from his first wife maureen became a father on sept 7 
1985 
paul mccartney is working on an album which includes some songs 
cowritten by elvis costello to be released later this year he has 
too many commitments to consider the 25th anniversary his spokesman 
bernard doherty said there have been a number of anniversaries in 
recent years there will be lots of anniversaries coming up hes 
still very busy making music 
mccartney said in a live radio phonein on the bbcs russian 
service last month that the beatles will never be revived because 
to find a replacement for john is impossible 
mccartney has four children his family lives on a fortified 
forest estate in sussex in southeast england 
but in 1964 the beatles had scarcely begun although wildly 
popular on the continent the fabulous four and their records did 
not catch on in the united states until jan 17 when i want to 
hold your hand hit no 1 on the cashbox chart 
within a year they grossed 16 million in the first weeks 
showing of their movie a hards day night and lennons kooky 
book in his own write climbed best seller lists overnight in 
rapid succession they made six hit albums including 1967s anthem 
to the summer of love sgt peppers lonely hearts club band 
sgt pepper sold 25 million records in its first three 
months and stayed on the charts for a staggering 113 weeks capitol 
records estimates the albums worldwide sales at 15 million since 
1967 
this alternately melancholy terrifying and exhilarating record 
captured as no other the complex textures of its time a 
supercharged corrosively contradictory summer when hippies grooved 
at the monterey pop festival black emotions exploded in riots in 
detroit and newark and a war grew bloodier in vietnam youthful 
listeners somehow heard all of this in sgt pepper an album 
whose themes included eastern culture sweet and terrifying 
psychedelic fantasies the widening gulf between young and old and 
above all loneliness 
to me the beatles created an excitement about being in the 
business itself says songwriter and performer christopher cross 
they stick out to me as the greatest thing in pop music paul 
mccartney has always been and remains my biggest influence of all 
time because of song structure he and john taught me how to write 
songs 
cross who won four grammy awards in 1981 for his song and lp 
sailing was 12 when he saw the beatles on ed sullivan

the cbs press release heralding the beatles first appearance in 
the united states was in retrospect lowkeyed it identified them 
as the beatles of london a wildly popular quartet of english 
recording stars they were billed on the show with the comedy team 
of mitzi mccall and charlie brill impressionist frank gorshin a 
tumbling act called the four fays and 37 members of the cast from 
the broadway musical oliver 
sullivan more animated than usual handled the squealing 
audience as a father would a hyperactive child he gently shushed 
them and made the girls promise to stay in their seats he told the 
audience elvis presley had sent a wire wishing the beatles a 
tremendous success in our country introduced a commercial for 
aero shave and then swept his arm through the air as the curtain 
parted 
there was paul 21 wideeyed and boyish feverishly working the 
bass guitar and singing all my loving at one microphone george 
20 was on lead guitar john 23 on rhythm guitar harmonized at 
another microphone ringo 23 sat high above them on a platform 
pounding out beats on the drums 
paul soloed on til there was you from the broadway show 
the music man later after a magician did card tricks and 
georgia brown sang songs from oliver the beatles returned with 
the lennonmccartney song she loves you 
they were fresh and school boy neat in their edwardian jackets 
shirts and ties their hair considered outrageously long at the 
time fell in agreeable bangs across their foreheads and stopped 
somewhere midneck the beatle hair style eventually became as 
conservative as a crewcut 
after the sullivan show the beatles played the washington 
coliseum in washington dc on feb 12 they played carnegie hall 
where fans drowned their music in screams 
three years later the beatles began to show signs of weariness 
and drifting apart exhausted from years of concert touring 
mccartney and lennon had each done some independent film work 
lennon met his future wife yoko ono in a london art gallery in 
1967 around the time they recorded sgt pepper harrison went 
off to india to study sitar under ravi shankar two months after 
sgt pepper was released brian epstein the beatles manager 
and stabilizing influence died with him went much of the spirit 
that had held the group together 
in 1970 a year after the critically acclaimed abbey road was 
released mccartney came out with a solo lp and a selfinterview 
critical of the other beatles the lp and movie let it be came 
out and by the end of the year the group dissolved

a bare light bulb throws rays of hope 
on the faces of some of armenias earthquake children who now study 
math and the virtues of communism inside a tent 
for the 20 fourth graders in a green army tent that is now 
leninakans school no 7 school bells are ringing again 
the corpses and the coffins are gone so are sobbing relatives 
and the rescue workers who searched for the living amid the dead a 
coalfired furnace in the tent offers warmth 
the children and other survivors dont need to look far for 
reminders of dec 7 the day two months ago that the earth shook and 
introduced a new lesson one on survival their former school lies 
in ruins just over a hill 
they are among tens of thousands of people who never left the 
area or have returned since the earthquake smashed northwestern 
armenia with a blow measuring 69 on the richter scale 
of the halfmillion people left homeless 100000 women children 
and the elderly were evacuated those who remain are trying to cope 
some complain the government is not doing enough to help them get 
clothes and solid roofs over their heads others doubt the 
reconstruction will be finished in two years as authorities 
promise still others alleged that government officials were keeping 
donated relief goods for themselves 
those who remain live in tents mobile homes and the few 
remaining habitable buildings they shop for food in surprisingly 
wellstocked stores and receive government benefits 
after recovering 25000 bodies 15000 in leninakan alone 
workers have moved on to clearing and rebuilding the kremlin says 
the quake cost 161 billion 
broken concrete and twisted pipes have been dumped along roads 
leading to armenias secondlargest city 
we will build up our native leninakan in two years vows a 
sign at one city entrance placed under a bronze bust of vladimir i 
lenin the founder of the soviet state for whom the city was named 
about 100 construction workers are building themselves temporary 
dormitories in leninakan martin akopyan said his siberian brigade 
hopes to finish the dorms by the end of february and start on homes 
for the general population 
among those hoping for permanent quarters are asmik tosunyan and 
three other people living in a oneroom mobile home donated by west 
germany the 6footby18foot room has just one mattress two 
chairs and a propane stove but no electricity or running water 
narina ophsepyan 18 was not so lucky since the earthquake 
toppled her ninestory apartment building and killed her parents 
she has lived in an unheated tent with no water 
i asked for a house but they said where are we going to find 
one she said as she shivered on a leninkan street 
she and several other residents of leninakan and spitak the city 
closest to the epicenter complained they have received none of the 
millions of dollars worth of clothing donated from abroad and other 
soviet republics she accused the bosses of keeping it for 
themselves or selling it 
yuri i khodzhamiryan a deputy premier of armenia said there 
isnt enough clothing to go around asked about the charges he 
said everywhere there are bad people 
officials say 6 million square yards of housing must be built 
more than 2 million in leninakan itself new schools and factories 
also are planned 
they say it will be done in two years but god knows when they 
actually will finish said an angry spitak man without a job and 
home who refused to give his name 
vladimir i reshitilov a soviet construction minister and head 
of the leninakan branch of a government earthquake commission said 
it is completely realistic to build minimal housing and social 
facilities in two years but he acknowledged complete restoration 
will take longer 
officials insist construction will be monitored carefully to 
prevent shoddy workmanship which officials says contributed to the 
death toll a commission is investigating why many new buildings 
collapsed in the quake while older structures were only damaged 
new buildings will be no higher than four stories and located 
away from heavy seismic areas said alexander g krivov deputy 
chairman of a committee on architecture and city building more 
detailed building codes like those in the united states are being 
drawn and construction workers will be required to follow them 
scrupulously he said 
norik g muradyan the communist party chief in spitak lost 11 
relatives in the disaster and said officials are taking no chances 
in reconstruction 
we know now that quality thats life muradyan said in his 
makeshift office a trailer donated by the british because of 
that we are obliged not only to rush but also to inspect 
everything 
slipshod practices are evident however along railroad tracks 
wooden building panels and plasterboards are stacked high warping 
in the weather and unprotected from rain and snow that could cause 
rot 
authorities have determined it wont be safe to rebuild on the 
site where spitak stood at the confluence of three quake faults 
the city where 23000 lived and 3200 died in the quake will be 
rebuilt a few miles to the southwest 
today the old city appears frozen in time a museum of horror 
hundreds of collapsed houses lie where they fell seemingly 
untouched since dec 7 in the shadow of beautiful snowcovered 
mountains 
eventually the rubble will be cleared and a park small factories 
and railroad station may be built there officials said but for 
now all energy is being poured into the new location a picturesque 
valley with fresh bulldozer tracks on recently cleared fields 
a sign at a tent city for construction workers proclaims it our 
human duty to rebuild spitak 
muradyan takes the proclamation to heart and says his work is 
good therapy 
when you are left alone there is always grief both in your 
soul and mind and tears in your eyes he said softly but when 
you are working for the sake of children and their future and for 
the sake of your homeland you must put everything aside and work 
like a devotee to your people

president bush tonight unveils a budget plan 
keyed to his campaign promises of kinder and gentler programs 
without new taxes but it leaves difficult decisions on reducing the 
federal deficit for later 
the president in a 9 pm est speech before a joint meeting of 
congress will call for a nation more competitive abroad and more 
compassionate at home 
to those ends he will propose more federal spending in fiscal 
1990 for clean air and clean coal technology for science and space 
for aids research and aid to the homeless education and child care 
according to administration and congressional sources 
bush claims that those costs will be offset by about 4 billion 
in new revenue from a controversial cut in the capital gains tax 
another campaign promise and 2 billion by holding the expansion 
of the military budget to the rate of inflation 
you will have a very detailed and precise descriptions of the 
priorities of the bush administration said marlin fitzwater the 
white house press secretary 
left deliberately unclear however will be how much bush 
embraces the many budget cuts he left unchanged from the firstdraft 
spending plan former president reagan submitted last month 
bush will distance himself from any of the individual unpopular 
cuts by inviting congress to help set each program level in 
accordance with his flexible freeze plan to limit overall 
spending in general categories 
reagan suggested terminating dozens of domestic programs and 
cutting back many others in order to reduce the deficit below the 
100 billion maximum allowed by the grammrudman law 
bushs calculations include the total savings from those reagan 
cuts in contending that he too is meeting the deficit target he 
may claim a deficit as low as 90 billion by including sales of 
government assets that do not count toward the grammrudman goal 
said one source who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
gop lawmakers briefed wednesday by bushs budget director 
richard darman said the bush plan proposes lumping programs 
together in boxes within which some would have to be cut in 
order to expand others 
democrats didnt wait for bushs speech to begin criticizing his 
plan to cut the capital gains tax saying it is a tax break for the 
rich and will increase the deficit not reduce it as the president 
claims 
at a time when virtually every segment of our country is being 
asked to sustain a sacrifice of one form or another it is simply 
unacceptable to be considering tax breaks for the very wealthiest 
segment said sen jim sasser dtenn chairman of the senate 
budget committee 
many private economists dispute bushs claim that the rate cut 
will increase government revenues by spurring business investment 
and activity 
nonetheless the bush budget will claim about 4 billion in new 
revenue from the plan which would be implemented gradually and 
eventually cut the rate to 15 percent for productive assets held for 
two years or more capital gains now are taxed at either 28 percent 
or 33 percent depending on income 
bush a former texas oil man also will propose new tax breaks 
for the oil and gas industry additional energy production in 
selected offshore areas and in the alaska wildlife refuge both 
opposed by environmentalists also are part of the plan sources 
said 
other bush proposals aimed at business and trade growth will 
include 
restoring a research and development tax credit for business 
urban enterprise zones using special tax breaks to lure 
companies to depressed areas 
expanded support of research and science including the space 
station and shuttle and the proposed superconducting supercollider 
physics laboratory 
bush will focus part of his speech and proposals on the 
environment promising more spending on the superfund program for 
toxic waste cleanups clean coal technology clean water and 
wetlands programs and a greater emphasis on global environmental 
problems such as the greenhouse effect 
a few selected domestic programs in his budget would be increased 
as part of his kinder gentler nation promise sources said they 
include 
increasing the head start preschool education program by 250 
million 
a merit award program for schools and increased subsidies for 
black colleges 
a renewed and expanded tax credit for adoption two years after 
the 1986 tax bill eliminated a deduction to offset those costs 
rejection of reagans proposed 17 billion cut in the medicaid 
health program for the poor 
a child care tax credit of 1000 for lowincome families 
full funding of the mckinney homeless assistance act 
25 million to start a national program for youth in public 
service 
increased spending for the battle against drug abuse although 
not the full amount authorized by congress 
increased spending on aids research 
the bush budget revisions will also reflect the 19 billion cost 
to the taxpayer next year of his program to bail out the ailing 
savings and loan industry 
hell also embrace reagans plans for upgrading aviation safety 
and add 350 million to the 14 billion reagan sought for cleanups 
needed at the governments nuclear plants the sources said 
reagan asked congress to increase military spending 2 percent 
over inflation in fiscal 1990 bush will propose an inflationonly 
increase next year with a 1 percent increase over inflation in 1991 
and a 2 percent increase in 1993 
bush will revise reagans economic assumptions slightly to 
reflect his higher projection for shortterm interest rates in 1989 
than the 63 percent projected in the reagan budget 
since taking office bush and his budget chief darman have been 
urging capitol hill leaders to join in highlevel budget talks to 
shortcut the balky congressional budget process 
under regular procedures the presidents budget gets modified by 
the house and senate into a final budget resolution which then 
serves as an overall guide for legislation produced later by the 
appropriations and taxwriting committees

farmers are able to borrow money again and the 
agriculture department says its a good sign that the battered 
agricultural economy is well on its way to recovery 
the large paydown in farm debt held by major farm lenders 
appears to be over and debt is expected to grow 15 percent to 35 
percent in 1989 the departments economic research service said 
farm loan demand strengthened in the past year and should continue 
to expand in 1989 
moreover the agency said wednesday in a report commercial banks 
that specialize in farm finance are doing well compared with the 
mid1980s by last summer their returns on equity were up 40 
percent from 1987 and more than 150 percent above 1986 
the improving farm economy will save more agricultural banks 
from failure in 1989 the report said failures after setting a 
postdepression record of 75 in 1987 fell to 41 in 1988 and may be 
the same to sharply fewer in 1989 
total bank failures including agricultural institutions may 
be closer to 100 in 1989 instead of more than 200 in each of the 
previous two years the report said 
at the height of the recent financial crunch as plummeting land 
values cut sharply into assets thousands of farmers owed so much 
that they couldnt qualify for additional credit to pay bills 
with the lid on further credit farmers often liquidated or 
culled livestock herds sold commodities held in storage and took 
other steps to reduce debts as this paydown took effect banks and 
other lending institutions have eased back 
as a result the report said creditworthy farmers should have 
ample access to operating credit for spring planting and other 
production expenses this year 
farm lenders are optimistic about financial conditions despite 
the 1988 drought and do not think it will sidetrack the farm 
recovery the report said 
major farm lending groups reported stronger portfolios in 1988 
and fewer farm loan delinquencies loan chargeoffs and 
foreclosures it said an exception was the departments farmers 
home administration which makes loans to the least creditworthy 
producers but indications are that it too is coming to grips 
with its problems the report said 
a major reason for the favorable farm financial outlook this year 
was said to be the continued strength in crop and livestock 
commodity sales 
better economic fundamentals also underlie longrun trends in 
agriculture the report said farmland markets have improved and 
the farm sector balance sheet of assets and liabilities has 
stabilized

farm and ranch inventories of cattle and calves 
edged down again to a 28year low of 99484000 head on jan 1 from 
99524000 a year ago according to new agriculture department 
estimates 
but the decline has slowed and there were indications many beef 
producers have started rebuilding their herds a year ago the us 
cattle herd was down 24 percent from the 102 million head that had 
been estimated jan 1 1987 this years decline was less than 1 
percent 
this slowed the recent downtrend in cattle inventories that 
began six years ago and was the second consecutive inventory below 
100 million head since 1961 the departments agricultural 
statistics board said wednesday 
the estimate was in line with recent predictions of usda 
analysts who say the shrinkage in the overall cattle herd may be 
starting to rebound as producers hold back breeding stock to 
rebuild herds beef output is expected to decline in the short run 
overall according to usda forecasts 1989 beef production may 
decline 5 percent to 7 percent from last year to the lowest level 
since 1980 
but large supplies of pork and poultry are expected and that 
could leave this years total meat output at only slightly below the 
record level of 1988 even so retail beef prices are expected to 
set records this year 
as of jan 1 the number of beef cows and heifers that have 
calved totaled 439 million head up 1 percent from a year ago the 
first increase following six consecutive years of decline 
beef cows were reported at 337 milion head up 2 percent from 
jan 1 1988 and dairy cows at 102 million head down 1 percent 
it was the smallest inventory of us milk cows since 1872 the 
report said 
the 1988 calf crop was estimated at almost 409 million head up 
2 percent from 1987 
analysts said the value of all cattle and calves as of jan 1 was 
estimated at about 604 billion up 16 percent from 52 billion a 
year earlier the average value was reported at 607 per head 
compared with 523 the previous year

an annual inventory report by the agriculture 
department shows that the nations flock of sheep and lambs 
increased slightly in 1988 for the third consecutive year 
 
the increase was only a small fraction of 1 percent however 
boosting the us flock to an estimated 10802000 sheep and lambs 
on jan 1 from 10784000 on jan 1 1988 
despite the recent gains the jan 1 count was one of the 
smallest in us history according to usda records going back for 
more than a century 
in 1970 for example there were 204 million sheep and lambs in 
the nations flocks and in 1867 when usda began counting sheep 
there were about 463 million head the industry peaked in 1942 at 
562 million 
primarily the decline stems from less demand for wool as more 
synthetics and cheaper substitute materials were introduced and the 
declining demand for lamb in consumer diets the report said

janet mondlane educated in a oneroom 
schoolhouse near downers grove ill was 17 and dreaming of 
becoming a doctor in africa when she met an african revolutionary at 
a summer church camp 
he changed her life 
it was 1951 and eduardo mondlane who became the founder and 
first president of the mozambican liberation front was 31 and 
lecturing at church camps as part of his scholarship to oberlin 
college in ohio 
i am a product of eduardo mondlane says his widow 55 who 
heads the red cross in mozambique still wracked by war and famine 
14 years after independence from portugal and 20 years after her 
husbands assassination 
i grew up in this little town near chicago until i was 7 i 
lived out in the country the former janet rae johnson recalled in 
an interview life was calm very stable not many ideas were 
passing through 
she said eduardo was able to write on a blank sheet and he 
wrote on it until the time he died 
on feb 3 1969 mondlane was killed by a parcel bomb at his 
office in dar es salaam tanzania where the revolutionary movement 
known by its portuguese acronym frelimo was headquartered 
during the war against the portuguese 
during the whole long struggle every now and then you had to 
pick up the children and leave the house in the middle of the night 
because word came that someone was coming to attack mrs mondlane 
said 
im not at all a violent person as a matter of fact im rather 
a pacifist but my life has been very much linked with war 
unfortunately 
her work as head of the mozambican red cross involves providing 
emergency aid for millions of refugees displaced by fighting between 
the frelimo government which took power in 1975 under a marxist 
constitution and guerrillas of the mozambican national resistance 
supported for many years by the whiteminority governments of south 
africa and what then was rhodesia 
mrs mondlane said she is not a marxist but is a member of the 
frelimo party and a deputy in the peoples assembly the national 
legislature 
todays mozambique is not what she had expected she said 
i never counted on so much war thats for sure we thought 
that it would be possible to develop the country it hasnt been 
a major decision of her life was relinquishing her american 
citizenship 
the rest of my family is in the states its a question of do 
you break these ties or dont you really throw in the lot or not 
i decided yes this is really my country i really dedicated my 
life to this country since i met eduardo and thats a long time ago 
i went to the church camp in lake geneva wis and there was 
eduardo we students were supposed to go to a different lecture 
every day i went to the lecture monday on africa and stayed there 
i was just mesmerized 
she and mondlane exchanged letters for the next 18 months after 
high school graduation she went to marianhill college in ohio to be 
near him then they both transferred to northwestern university in 
evanston ill 
blacks and whites didnt get married then she said the 
process took five years trying to work through things with my 
family there was a lot of hullabaloo from his missionary friends 
about marrying instead of going to the congo 
mondlane went to work for the united nations and didnt return to 
africa until 1961 
after nine months as a professor at syracuse university in new 
york mondlane went to tanzania where three mozambican exile groups 
united in 1962 under his leadership and began the guerrilla war 
after her husbands death mrs mondlane helped fund schools and 
medical posts in the northern provinces that frelimo controlled 
until independence came in 1975 
what id like to do is go and work on my farm in the 
countryside but here i am still working here doing the same thing 
i was doing all my life said mrs mondlane

soon after gen alfredo stroessner was 
ousted in a coup residents of the working class neighborhood 
barrio stroessner strung some rope around the neck of a statue 
of the dictator and pulled it down 
stroessners cult of personality which in 34 years saw a city 
international airport and even a popular polka named after him is 
crumbling as paraguayans try to erase remnants of the man who was 
ousted friday by gen andres rodriguez 
at president stroessner international airport an employee using 
a spatula and bucket of warm water worked to remove the ubiquitous 
posters of the onetime president and only leader as he often 
was described 
gone too is the large flashing neon sign that for years at 
night blinked out in red letters the message stroessner peace 
work and wellbeing from atop the bank of industrial development 
next to a downtown park 
government employees still slip and refer to president 
stroessner instead of president rodriguez but the 
everpresent photos of the stocky shrewd exarmy commanderinchief 
have disappeared from their offices 
the newspaper ultima hora offered a tongueincheek sale of 
framed pictures and paintings in various sizes poses and 
expressions of a known exmilitary president 
the offer is limited and will not be repeated the phony ad 
said 
the roman catholic churchrun radio caritas held a poll to 
determine what new name to use for the airport the neighborhood 
barrio stroessner and the city presidente stroessner located 
about 200 miles east of the capital across the parana river from 
brazil 
one caller suggested the airport be dubbed freedom airport 
another february 3rd airport to mark the day of the coup 
others suggested barrio stroessner become barrio john paul 
ii to commemorate the popes visit to paraguay in may 
government officials are reluctant to criticize the stroessner 
years too harshly telling reporters they prefer to look to the 
future rodriguez himself set the tone monday by saying his former 
boss and friend was not a dictator 
the stroessner government had different stages and within those 
stages there were 32 or 33 years of a great government says new 
foreign minister luis maria argana 
the public reaction is more varied and harder to gauge but as 
opposition leader domingo laino notes acerbicly few in the army 
stood by stroessner in his moment of need no one rallied to his 
side while he remained a prisoner in paraguay and the majority of 
people who saw him off at the airport were there to jeer 
theres no doubt about it the majority of the people are 
euphorically enchanted said the rev eugene connolly who came 
from brooklyn ny 19 years ago to serve in colonel oviedo a city 
80 miles east of asuncion it will take a couple of weeks until 
they are over this 
that view is not unanimous a parking lot attendant said he 
was a good man well have to wait to see what comes next 
but interviews with paraguayans like hilaria sandoval indicated 
why the end of a 34year authoritarian was almost an anticlimax 
now you can talk and nobody will arrest you said ms 
sandoval a vegetable vendor who carries carrots onions and spinach 
doortodoor on her head 
i think gen rodriguezs coup was a magnificent act she 
said i would like to vote for the general for president in the 
next elections

to the delight of republicans and 
discomfort of some democrats jerry brown is back in the political 
spotlight campaigning for the onceobscure post of chair of the 
california democratic party 
the political comeback of the former governor and twotime 
presidential candidate follows six years of selfimposed political 
exile part of it spent in seclusion writing in mexico and japan 
and part working in mother teresas hospital in calcutta and on a 
care hunger project in bangladesh 
browns latest campaign will conclude with voting saturday among 
the 2800 delegates credentialed for the california democratic 
partys annual convention another liberal brown ronald h brown 
is expected to be named chairman of the national democratic party on 
friday 
brown 50 once dubbed gov moonbeam by his critics has 
lined up endorsements from an impressive array of party leaders and 
is regarded as the favorite over investment banker steve westly 32 
of menlo park westly is the current vice chair of the party and 
traditionally would be unopposed for chairman 
browns critics note that as governor from 1975 through 1983 he 
shunned the party and they contend he would use the chairs office 
not to serve the party but as a stepping stone to advance his own 
political career 
they also say one of his weaknesses as governor was neglect of 
the sort of administrative detail that is a major part of the state 
chairs job and that browns election would give new life to what 
have become stale republican attacks against controversial aspects 
of browns governorship from medflies to his appointment of rose 
bird as chief justice ms bird was recalled by voters in 1986 
largely because of her opposition to the death penalty 
brown acknowledges and dismisses such criticism saying that the 
18 primary and general election campaigns he has conducted over the 
past two decades give him the experience contacts and fundraising 
ability to revitalize the party 
i think that issue of negative baggage is overstated people 
dont replay history forever brown says making jokes 
exaggerating his past political problems 
i guess i feel a little bit like typhoid mary he joked in 
one interview shortly after announcing his candidacy late last year 
i walk in and people want to step back a little ohhhhh boy its 
going to be hayden and bird willie brown death penalty cesar 
chavez farm workers whewww 
but browns image is not a joke to some democrats 
he has too much baggage to help the party recoup says 
assemblyman john vasconcellos of san jose a democrat generally 
supportive of brown during his governorship 
and assemblyman richard katz a san fernando valley democrat who 
has formed an exploratory committee for a race for lieutenant 
governor in 1990 doesnt want brown to become a fresh campaign 
issue 
i dont see any evidence that hes changed what has jerry 
brown done in the last six years to show hes in touch with the 
people of california he seems to think he has to go to calcutta to 
see people in need katz says 
brown says his goals will be to rebuild what he describes as a 
decaying democratic party particularly in fundraising and he says 
that goal not his own career will be his focus as chairman 
but if he succeeds in strengthening the democratic party the 
people now criticizing his bid will want him to run for office but 
he adamently declines to specify any future office 
brown has gone out of his way in his comeback bid to admit past 
mistakes in a long introspective article he wrote for the 
sacramento bee the week before formally announcing his campaign for 
chair he specifically addressed his rocky relationship with the 
party he now wants to lead 
one thing i did not do as governor is build a strong 
democratic party or even an enduring political organization i knew 
where i was going but too often i was going there by myself 
brown wrote i had become so immersed in campaigning and running 
that i neglected the people around me 
brown acknowledges that his bid for the unpaid post of party 
chairman is his bid to reenter politics but he denies that his 
reentry will be at the expense of the party and he pledges to 
serve the full fouryear term which presumably would take him out 
of 1992 senate or presidential races 
im back back to build the party and back to stay brown 
told convention delegates in red bluff last week

as thousands of american teenagers 
struggle with the complexities of basic algebra a 17yearold 
english girl is being wooed by harvard and several other 
universities to lecture and continue her mathematical research on 
such subjects as quantum groups and statistical mechanics 
ruth j lawrence of oxford england is manipulating some of the 
most complex concepts in mathematics her work has taken her to the 
outer fringes of theoretical physics and mathematics such subjects 
as knot and string theory and the connections between the world of 
particle physics and mathematics 
she entered oxford university six years ago and by age 13 had her 
degree today she is working on her doctorate and has long since 
caught the attention of the worlds top mathematicians 
lawrence has already taught students at oxford on a tutorial 
basis if she accepts a position at an american university it will 
be mainly to conduct research but she said she might lead a seminar 
or deliver an occasional lecture in addition to harvard and 
berkeley princetons institute for advance study is interested in 
bringing lawrence in for a year 
it all began not in some exclusive british school but in 
lawrences own home in oxford where her father harry a computer 
consultant gave ruth her entire preoxford education 
i was always dealing with adults so when i got to oxford i 
fitted into the atmosphere he didnt use any textbooks he 
taught me totally himself she said wednesday while visiting 
harvard with her father 
lawrence got top scores on her oxford entrance exam it was at 
that point her father said it was obvious to me that she was a 
little better than most 
once at oxford lawrence studied under sir michael atiyah royal 
society research professor at oxford and one of the great 
mathematicians of the world according to john addison chairman 
of the mathematics department at the university of california at 
berkeley one of the schools recruiting lawrence 
lawrence seems to have taken her rapid rise in stride she is 
much more interested in talking about the vast unknown in the world 
of mathematics than dwelling on her accomplishments 
when i was taught mathematics in the beginning i was interested 
in it i just liked it i didnt think it was anything special 
lawrence said 
now lawrence says the age thing really does not matter for 
more than the first two seconds i talk to mathematicians as 
mathematicians and i think they talk to me in the same way 
addison berkeleys math chairman has been tracking lawrences 
career for the past seven years word was certainly getting around 
in the mathematical field that there was this very unusual 
prodigy addison said 
lawrence just spent four weeks in california attending a 
prestigious mathematics conference at the mathematical science 
research institute also in berkeley the discussion among 
scientists and mathematicians from around the world focused on the 
relationship between physics and mathematics lawrences area of 
concentration 
addison interviewed lawrence for a possible research position at 
berkeley and found her a very nice person sometimes prodigies end 
up being kind of strange or egotistic i didnt sense that 
harry lawrence said he taught his daughter at home so she could 
reach her highest potential he is using the same method in teaching 
his other daughter rebecca 15 who is something of a piano 
prodigy with one british broadcasting corp concert under her belt 
to the inevitable question of whether ruth feels she has missed 
out on childhood she answers unequivocally ive had a very 
enjoyable childhood ive had so many opportunities i wouldnt have 
had if id gone the ordinary route

an environmental dispute between north 
carolina and tennessee took a new twist when two legislators here 
decided to fight fire with firewater by proposing a ban on 
tennessee liquor 
state sen dennis winner said he wanted to let tennessee leaders 
know that their decision to stop a north carolina company from 
dumping wastewater into the pigeon river would have economic 
ramifications in both states 
im not trying to knock them to their knees winner said 
the basic problem is they dont think they have anything to lose 
winner and state sen bob swain introduced a bill wednesday that 
would ban the sale in north carolina of any liquor manufactured in 
tennessee or purchased from a tennessee vendor 
theres no revenge involved said swain tongue in cheek i 
just think ol tennessee liquor is bad for people 
the bill is the latest salvo in an increasingly bitter feud 
between the states over tennessees refusal to grant champion 
international co a permit to discharge wastewater into the pigeon 
river at its canton paper mill 
the pigeon flows from north carolina into tennessee skirting the 
northeastern border of great smoky mountains national park 
in response to concerns by residents of cocke county tenn 
officials in tennessee announced dec 23 they would not grant a 
variance allowing the north carolina plant to continue dumping into 
the river 
a champion official announced this week that operations at the 
mill would be scaled back as a result of tennessees decision 
threatening the jobs of 1000 people 
nonetheless a spokesman for tennessee gov ned mcwherter said 
the decision not to grant the variance is final 
what north carolina does i guess is north carolinas 
businesss said ken renner the spokesman about the only 
similarity between tennessee whiskey and pigeon river water is 
theyre about the same color 
the liquor bill quickly inspired jokes and puns in the halls of 
north carolinas legislative building including talk of fighting 
fire with firewater 
a spokesman for the north carolina alcoholic beverage control 
commission estimated that more than 1 million bottles of tennessee 
whiskey are sold in the state each year 
winner said he chose to target tennessee liquor to avoid 
conflicting with the us constitutions provision forbidding states 
from restricting interstate commerce 
the courts have ruled that the 21st amendment allows states to 
regulate liquor traffic within their borders and that it supersedes 
the interstate commerce clause he said 
a spokesman for the jack daniels distillery in lynchburg tenn 
said he was only vaguely familiar with the champion controversy but 
the proposed liquor ban was troubling 
were not too happy i dont guess said spokesman roger 
brashears it dont make us too pleased

an antiterrorist program is protecting the 
nations electric power suppliers even though planners doubt a 
coordinated attack ever will be launched against the energy network 
an industry official says 
the program is about six months old and involves an ongoing 
working relationship with the fbi michehl gent president of the 
north american electric reliability council told a senate hearing 
on wednesday 
he said the program which was 2 years in the making was 
adopted even though skepticism was rampant among its creators 
that terrorists would carry out a multisite attack on us energy 
supplies 
natural events such as hurricanes present a greater threat to 
us power systems said gent whose organization represents 
virtually all us and canadian suppliers of electricity 
the department of energy has been advising us companies 
privately of a growing threat of technoterrorism attacks on 
vital domestic energy facilities and it is pressing them to fortify 
their defenses 
gent said his group had agreed with doe and national security 
council officials not to talk about the program because of fear of 
tipping off terrorists he said his testimony before the senate 
governmental affairs committee is the first and i hope the last 
public utterance of our program 
he said he would be willing to discuss specifics of the program 
in a closed committee session which committee chairman john glenn 
dohio said could be done 
glenn said oil and natural gas pipeline representatives had 
declined to appear before the panel out of fear that sensitive 
security information would be revealed 
the committee concluded two days of hearings on the vulnerability 
of us telecommunications and energy resources to terrorism in 
testimony tuesday the committee was told the increasing 
sophistication of us telecommunications systems and their 
concentration at fewer sites made them more vulnerable to terrorist 
attack 
the committee also was told the federal government was 
illprepared to deal with a terrorist assault on private 
communications 
a doe official wednesday said that in the past two years his 
department has taken decisive steps to substantially strengthen 
and reorganize the nations ability to respond to nonnuclear energy 
emergencies 
those steps include an energy emergency management system within 
doe and an interagency group on energy vulnerability said edward v 
badolato does deputy assistant secretary for energy emergencies 
we filled a vacuum badolato said adding that he wanted to 
ensure that wed never have to go before this body or the american 
people and say that we had information even general information 
that something was being perpetrated by enemies of the united states 
on our energy infrastructure and we stood idly by and didnt do 
anything about it 
he said doe like the state department put out several 
advisories in 1987 that there were foreign terrorist threats that 
could involve the united states he did not elaborate 
i take the threat seriously the potential threat seriously 
badolato said since 1980 there have been approximately 8000 
attacks against energy systems around the world weve been lucky in 
the united states but the individuals who do this are only a plane 
ride away 
another witness robert k mullen said there had been 283 
documented cases of sabotage against american energy systems since 
1980 
but mullen a terrorism expert said he saw no evidence of an 
increasing terrorist threat in the united states and that most 
previous acts of sabotage had been incidents such as shooting at 
power lines or arson against gasoline station owners or operators

president bush is sending congress a 30year 
200 billion plan to rescue the savings and loan industry that is 
carefully crafted to avoid inflating the federal budget deficit next 
year 
the proposal submitted as part of the 1990 budget spreads the 
costs over 30 years and shifts some of the budget outlays into the 
current 1989 fiscal year 
as a result bush is making it easer to keep his no new taxes 
pledge in the first year of his presidency by including an immediate 
200 million savings in 1990 
the president would spend only 19 billion in tax dollars in 
1990 on the biggest government bailout ever compared with 21 
billion proposed by the outgoing reagan administration reagan 
called for outlays of 185 billion in fiscal years 1990 through 
1993 31 billion more than bush would spend in his first four 
budgets 
but bush would increase spending this year to 111 billion up 
from 87 billion in the reagan budget 
that is the accounting sleight of hand that is in the bush 
plan said rep charles schumer dny a member of the house 
banking committee its not that taxpayers are going to be paying 
any less but that it shows up less on the budget 
treasury department officials who devised the bush plan declined 
several requests for interviews tuesday and wednesday 
the presidents plan is complex tax revenue and increased 
deposit insurance premiums paid by banks and thrifts would be used 
to make good on 40 billion in assistance pledged by sampl regulators 
last year and to pay off 50 billion in additional money borrowed 
through 30year bonds sold over the next three years 
the office of management and budget a white house agency this 
week released financing details showing 126 billion in spending 
from 1989 through 1999 according to the figures the government 
would continue to spend 38 billion a year after that in interest 
on the bonds bringing total spending to more than 200 billion over 
30 years 
the administration had said that solving the sampl problem would 
cost 90 billion but that amount did not account for the interest 
charges 
budget director richard darman said the public would shoulder 40 
billion of the cost over the first decade and 54 percent or more 
than 100 billion of the burden over 30 years 
in the first decade an additional 20 billion would be raised as 
an increase in the deposit insurance premiums paid by banks the 
money would stay in the bank fund the federal deposit insurance 
corp but would count as revenue in the general budget and allow 
the government to spend that amount in tax dollars without adding to 
the budget deficit 
private analysts make two criticisms of the presidents proposal 
that it doesnt provide enough money and that its based on overly 
optimistic interest rate assumptions 
i dont think there is enough money in this plan but i think 
it is a very good and substantial down payment said robert litan 
a banking expert with the brookings institution i can understand 
why they dont want to acknowledge that now but this is too 
little 
bert ely a financial institutions analyst in alexandria va 
said bush is assuming he can sell the 30year bonds at an interest 
rate of 76 percent nearly 15 percentage points lower than the 
current market 
of course its a rosy scenario ely said

the food and drug administration will hold a

aids antibody testing kits which could be used in the home 
the fda has been concerned about the accuracy of such tests and 
whether adequate counseling can be incorporated into a hometesting 
system for the fatal disease 
the whole public health service is very much concerned that you 
have a system that gives adequate results and that the results can 
be explained to people said paul parkman director of the fda 
office that regulates the materials used in the test kits 
the fda last april turned back requests by manufacturers who 
wanted to market an aids test kit and the agency said research on 
such kits would have to be done in hospitals clinics and other

the securities and exchange commission is 
seeking new regulations that would crack down on stockbrokers who 
use highpressure telephone tactics to sell penny stocks 
the sec rule proposed by a 50 vote on wednesday would not 
entirely ban unsolicited cold calls but would require brokerage 
firms to sign a written agreement with a new customer before 
completing a transaction 
brokers would also have to interview new customers to determine 
if they were suitable for risky investments and keep the suitability 
documents on file for inspection by regulators 
the stocks typically sell for less than 3 a share some are 
issued by legitimate companies but many are sold by companies with

vice president salvador laurels visit 
to ferdinand marcos bedside in hawaii is widely seen as a bid to 
revive his dying political fortunes and angle for rightwing support 
as he seeks the presidency 
on saturday laurel returned from honolulu carrying what he said 
were secret messages from the ailing marcos for president corazon 
aquino 
laurel appealed to mrs aquinos christian values to allow 
the expresident to come home to die but mrs aquino refused to see 
laurel reflecting the low esteem in which she holds the vice 
president 
furthermore many political commentators accused laurel of 
grandstanding in the sensitive national question of whether to 
allow the 71yearold marcos to return from exile in hawaii 
the nakedness of laurels ambitions leaves little room for 
respect wrote the manila chronicle it has become clear that 
the man is so obsessed with winning power that he would grab at 
straws to support his bid 
laurel has so little influence with mrs aquino that it seemed 
virtually impossible that he would be able to persuade her to relent 
and allow marcos to return home 
the government says marcos and his associates embezzled up to 10 
billion during his 20year rule and mrs aquino has refused to 
discuss his return until he gives back the money 
several congressmen and political commentators believe laurel 
intended through the trip to ingratiate himself with marcos 
followers especially those in northern luzon island and use them 
as a base of support in the 1992 presidential campaign 
inheriting the marcos mantle would enable laurel to outflank 
other potential centerright candidates such as sen juan ponce 
enrile who might appeal to those who would not support mrs aquino 
or anyone seen as her favored candidate 
mrs aquino has said she will not seek reelection 
with the demise of marcos the socalled solid north is in 
need of someone to rally around said rep florencio abad 
the 60yearold laurel would seem an ideal reconciliation 
candidate to bring together a nation still deeply divided three 
years after marcos was ousted in a popular uprising 
laurel announced he would run for president against marcos in 
1985 but stepped aside under pressure to become mrs aquinos 
running mate 
a member of an elite political clan laurel maintains links to 
the business community and the military 
but a series of political blunders has reinforced his deeply 
entrenched public image as an opportunist 
after a bloody august 1987 coup attempt laurel traveled to 
military bases ostensibly to investigate soldiers complaints 
before the television cameras he would shout do you want 
communists out of government that brought cheers from the troops 
but contempt from more liberalminded urban voters who joked that 
laurel was becoming a filipino mccarthy 
in september 1987 he resigned as foreign secretary citing 
widespread differences with mrs aquino on the 20yearold communist 
insurgency and other issues a year later he demanded she resign 
and call new elections but she refused 
instead of winning sympathy by his moves laurels popularity 
plunged manila newspapers and television stations rarely report his 
activities and his speeches draw only modest audiences 
despite laurels personal campaigning his nephew benjamin 
laurel was defeated in the january 1988 race for governor of 
batangas province the laurel family stronghold 
since formally breaking with the administration in august 
laurels attempt to organize a broadbased opposition movement have 
faltered 
he complained last year to foreign reporters that he was 
virtually ignored by the media his principal public forum in the 
capital has been occasional interviews by tagaloglanguage radio 
stations 
it would be a gross understatement to say that doy has an image 
problem wrote columnist ed olaguer referring to laurel by his 
nickname

the husband of a comatose woman begged an appeals 
court to let him end his wifes pregnancy to save her life and said 
in an interview that antiabortionists who oppose him are ripping 
my guts out 
i implore this court not to permit these two strangers to delay 
my decision martin klein said in an affidavit submitted to a 
state appeals court wednesday 
klein a 34yearold accountant from the long island suburb of 
upper brookville wants to be named guardian of his wife nancy so 
he can authorize an abortion that several doctors said could aid in 
her recovery 
but antiabortion activists john short and john broderick have 
sought to block him saying that aborting the fetus will not improve 
mrs kleins chances and will harm her psychologically they have 
applied to become her guardian to prevent the abortion 
klein was awarded the guardianship tuesday in a state trial 
court but the decision was stayed pending an appeal by short and 
broderick 
at the appellate hearing kleins attorney sidney schutz called 
short and broderick intruders strangers with no right to decide 
mrs kleins fate 
but mary spaulding shorts attorney countered that it was a 
conflict of interest for klein to be named guardian she said the 
abortion would violate his wifes wishes 
mrs klein had planned this pregnancy she was looking forward 
to this pregnancy and was happy about it ms short said the 
issue is not the right to an abortion but the right to procreate 
and have children 
in his affidavit klein said for nine years my wife and i 
have lived a happy and devoted life together i know her wishes and 
priorities including her own survival and recovery in view of the 
welfare of our 3yearold daughter 
the fivejudge appeals panel is due to make its decision by the 
end of the week short founder of the long island righttolife 
group pledged to take the case to the us supreme court if the 
panel ruled against him 
at least the fetus is one day older short said if we keep 
it going she will be a newborn alive child if nancy klein dies 
and the baby lives she will have an extension of herself in the 
baby 
in an interview with the associated press before the hearing 
klein referred to short and broderick when he said i just want to 
get this issue behind us theyre ripping my guts out 
everyone has a right to their beliefs he added but why 
dont they ever talk about my wife and about her life 
he said he visits his wife daily at north shore university 
hospital in manhasset where she has been in a coma since a dec 13 
car accident mrs klein 32 is about 17 weeks pregnant 
i tell her about friends who have called klein said 
acknowledging that hes not sure his wife can understand him i 
tell her about our daughter and just generally about how my day 
went 
im just taking one day at a time he added inside im 
tearing up but im trying to keep a smile on my face hopefully 
everything will work out 
in the lower court ruling judge bernard mccaffrey said that as 
of this time an abortion is not medically necessary to save mrs 
kleins life 
but mccaffrey said the issue before the court was mrs kleins 
constitutional rights if she were competent he said she would 
have the absolute right to an abortion up to the 24th week of 
pregnancy 
five medical experts testified that pregnancy increased the risks 
for the comatose patient and could possibly threaten her life but 
two medical experts testified the pregnancy was not lifethreatening 
short has said he and broderick are the only parties addressing 
the issue of mrs kleins psychological health 
were she to recover being told that her child is alive 
psychologically could only be a benefit he said telling her 
that they killed her child psychologically could be a disaster

standards for courtesy and reminding drivers that hacking is a 
service industry 
the riders have been terrific lusk told a reporter who was 
invited to ride with him wednesday if you give people a good 
quality ride they will pay for it 
lusk was unfailingly polite and cheerful and tried to make eye

repeated the destination to confirm it 
do you need some help getting in he asked solicitously of an 
elderly woman struggling to seat herself before she answered he 
flung open his door and sprinted around the cab to close the door 
for her 
wearing a yellow buttondown shirt and camel vneck sweater lusk

regulates about 35000 drivers and 12000 vehicles

which he completed must be beefed up along with standards for the 
english proficiency test which only 7 percent of applicants fail

the energy departments 81 billion plan to 
modernize and clean up nuclear weapons plants over 20 years would 
save the nations production of war devices but fail to remove all 
environmental hazards the head of general accounting office says 
modernization activities would essentially be completed by 
2010 and the nation would have a revitalized weapons complex 
comptroller general charles a bowsher told a congressional hearing 
wednesday however problems in the environmental area would still 
be with us 
bowsher told the house budget committee it would take up to 155 
billion over 30 years to modernize the industry clean up closed 
plants and protect the environment from radioactive contamination 
material for nuclear weapons is produced at reactors and other 
facilities in a dozen states but has effectively stopped because of 
safety concerns at reactor sites in washington state nevada and 
south carolina 
energy officials told another congressional committee last week 
they hope to get the tritiumproducing reactor at the savannah river 
site in south carolina back in operation before the end of the year 
but may not be able to do it that soon the reactor has been out of 
operation since august when an unexplained power surge caused it to 
shut down and other potential hazards were discovered 
the energy department in an unsigned statement submitted to the 
house committee said the department has produced and maintained 
an effective nuclear deterrent that is the cornerstone of our 
national defense 
but the department acknowledged that past decisions have focused 
on meeting shortterm national security needs rather than 
environmental and safety concerns 
it said the practice at many of the facilities of dumping waste 
into open unlined pits and ponds has led to a major challenge in 
restoring the soil and groundwater underlying some inactive waste 
sites 
bowsher in his testimony said in our opinion the 
departments plan does not adequately address the cleanup of 
existing facilities and decontamination of facilities as they are 
retired from service 
he said if problems affecting the nuclear complex are not 
addressed soon the countrys ability to produce and maintain a 
nuclear weapons arsenal is in serious jeopardy 
bowsher said the major difference between his congressional 
watchdog agencys estimate of 105 billion to 155 billion and the 
energy department estimate of 81 billion to modernize and clean up 
the plants is over how much it will take to decontaminate and 
protect the environment 
bowsher said the nuclear weapons complex is one of the more 
potentially dangerous industrial operations in the world and some 
nuclear production sites may be irreversibly contaminated 
he said energy department plans to spend 315 million in fiscal 
1990 on environmental cleanup represent only a small down 
payment on the 40 billion to 70 billion needed

the boeing 707 that crashed in the azores 
islands killing all 144 people aboard had recorded no serious 
mechanical problems and relatively few flight hours for a 
20yearold jet officials said 
the craft one of two boeing 707s owned by independent air corp 
had logged 12500 cycles or takeoffs and landings and less than 
50000 hours in the air 
if properly maintained there should not be a problem because 
of hours or number of cycles said jack barker a federal aviation 
administration spokesman in atlanta other aircraft involved in 
the news have had as much as 50000 cycles a great many more 
the caribbeanbound charter jet carrying 137 vacationers from 
italy and a sevenmember american crew crashed into a fogshrouded 
mountain wednesday as it approached an airport in the portuguese 
archipelago for refueling 
al pittman president of independent air headquartered in this 
town 25 miles southeast of nashville told reporters that for 
employees of the air charter service its like losing a member of 
your family 
generally everybody knows everybody else in a company this 
size pittman said there have been some tears here today in 
shock 
the crew members were leon daugherty 41 of nashville the 
captain sammy adcock 36 nashville 1st officer jorge gonzalez 
34 rex ga the flight engineer and flight attendants yvette 
murray 26 of marietta ga angela urban 24 west palm beach 
fla and helen ziegler 45 warner robins ga and sabrina 
cromarty of atlanta 
ms murray and the captain were planning to be married may 20 
according to her father tom murray of atlanta 
the plane had seven service difficulty reports during the past 
six years according to records at the faas aeronautical center in 
oklahoma city spokeswoman bobbie mardis said 
a report filed in january 1983 said the planes no 2 engine was 
shut down due to turbine failure another that month said a switch 
in the main landing gear failed and was replaced further details on 
the incidents were not immediately available ms mardis said 
two reports filed july 1987 showed problems with the planes 
altimeter and air speed monitors in the latter case the plane 
returned to atlanta for repairs 
the latest report filed in december indicated that during 
inspection a mechanic noticed a crack in an engine fan duct the 
duct was replaced and the plane was returned to service 
barker said wednesday night that he had not seen the reports and 
did not know their contents but he said any faults with the plane 
would not be considered a problem not if theyve been repaired 
he added that the faa had fined independent air 18000 in 1984 
but he did not know why 
pittman said one of the companys two jetliners lost oil pressure 
jan 21 as it flew into denver and was repaired for eight to 10 
hours before it resumed flying he did not know if the jet was the 
one that crashed wednesday 
im not aware of the service difficulty reports so id have 
to say they are fairly minor said orien dickerson the companys 
vice president and cofounder we have the same stringent 
monitoring program as delta american and all the major airlines 
independent air is 15 years old and flies 400500 charters per 
year mostly in the caribbean and europe

a black man who died in police custody 
was the victim of drug use and not police brutality as some 
activists have claimed officials said 
despite the autopsy finding about 55 demonstrators marched 
outside town hall for an ninth straight night wednesday to protest 
what they alleged to be brutality against 22yearold john tony 
jackson 
its the same answers that they had before said frank 
osborne jacksons uncle and leader of the nightly marches 
theyve diverted the traffic that wasnt the issue we have to go 
further 
the death in my opinion was caused by cardiac arrhythmia 
brought on by cocaine use morris county medical examiner dr 
ernest e tucker said as far as police brutality is concerned i 
couldnt find any evidence of police brutality 
i am calling this a homicide on the grounds that whoever 
supplied the drugs is responsible for his death he said 
county prosecutor lee trumbull said his office and local police 
will investigate the case as a homicide 
in terms of police brutality that case has ended 
trumbull said we now have a homicide investigation under way 
unequivocally the morristown police department or any 
individual member is not a suspect he said i would like to see 
the community as vigorous in attempting to identify the source of 
the drugs that killed tony jackson as theyve been in protesting 
david manahan mayor of this affluent township about 30 miles 
west of new york welcomed the findings but the mayor who has 
asked us justice department mediators to look at the case 
criticized trumbull for not talking with leaders in the black 
community before releasing the medical examiners report at a news 
conference 
the main problem here has been one of trust and mistrust and i 
think an opportunity was lost in the press conference he said 
cardiac arrhythmia as described by tucker occurs when a 
persons heart quivers and cannot pump sufficient quantities of 
blood the person faints and loses consciousness because blood 
cannot reach the brain 
traces of cocaine heroin quinine and codeine were found in 
jacksons blood and urine tucker said the drugs were taken in the 
hour before death 
jackson had puncture marks on both arms but tucker said he did 
not know if they were from medical efforts to revive jackson or from 
the victims own drug injections 
the autopsy also showed jackson had a laceration above the right 
eyebrow and a bruise on the scalp but tucker said they caused no 
damage to the skull or brain and did not contribute to his death 
jackson also had a history of bronchial asthma but that did not 
play any rose in his death tucker said 
jackson died jan 28 after he ran away from police who tried to 
arrest him on a traffic warrant police caught him after he bumped 
into an officer in the lowincome housing project where he lived 
afterward jackson complained of shortness of breath police 
said witnesses said he cried out for help and collapsed soon after 
police took him to morristown memorial hospital where he was 
pronounced dead

it is highly unlikely charles manson 
will ever be freed the chairman of the state parole board said 
after the panel refused to release the notorious mass murderer for a 
seventh time 
hes still at war with society and definitely a danger but 
anything is possible albert leddy chairman of the threemember 
board of prison terms told reporters after announcing wednesday 
that manson will remain at san quentin prison at least three more 
years 
manson leader of a cultlike family that in 1969 went on a 
grisly monthlong murder spree killing actress sharon tate and 
eight other people was denied parole by a unanimous vote 
manson declined to attend the hearing after complaining about 
being held in handcuffs and a waist chain that was too long the 
panel offered to let him come in without chains pending approval by 
the warden but he declined said spokesman vernell crittendon 
he is vicious and he is terrible steven kay a deputy 
district attorney from los angeles told the panel he certainly 
is one of the most vicious killers we have ever had in the history 
of our country 
leddy said parole for manson was rejected because of the nature 
of the slayings many of which involved torture and mutilation an 
extensive criminal history dating to childhood an unfavorable 
psychiatric report disciplinary problems in prison and no 
indication his behavior would change if he were released 
outside the prison walls three men and a woman dressed in black 
demonstrated in favor of mansons bid for parole waving signs one 
of which read find a new boogieman give charlie a break 
its sort of a human rights thing explained demostrator tina 
williams of san francisco everybody in america should be allowed 
a fair hearing and he didnt get one 
kay told the board he doubted manson was seriously interested in 
being paroled on previous occasions kay said manson indicated he 
would like to be paroled to death valley with spiders and snakes or 
else be sent to outer space 
at his last parole hearing three years ago manson said he was a 
force of darkness and had been spending his time fashioning 
scorpion dolls to unleash torment into the world outside 
kay also told the board that since the conviction of manson and 
many of his followers the state has received 352000 letters and 
petitions from people opposed to their paroles 
leddy said it is highly unlikely the murderer ever will be 
freed 
manson was convicted of masterminding the 1969 los angeles 
slayings of miss tate coffee heiress abigail folger hairdresser 
jay sebring polish filmmaker voityk frykowski stephen parent 
musician gary hinman stuntman donald shorty shea and leno and 
rosemary labianca

decision overturning californias death penalty law is serving a 
life prison term

in a courtyard where only enormous 
wooden and rusting beams keep the walls from collapsing the 
moneychangers ply their trade 
in this sensitive and openly tolerated black market the value of 
currency can change with a small gesture of the hand or inflection 
of the voice 
today there is no sign of panic the us dollar is changing 
hands for 210 afghanis compared to 238 a week ago when soviet 
soldiers were still seen in full force 
now the soviets are all but gone and the moneychangers say 
theres a feeling their departure will lead to peace and that the 
perenially warring afghans will settle down to their traditional way 
of handling things by making a deal 
whether thats a realistic attitude remains to be seen but the 
red armys departure is having a buoyant effect 
we didnt need them here said one moneychanger mohammad 
yahir we have problems but we can solve them ourselves god 
willing i think it will be ok 
one by one soviet bases around this city of 2 million people 
have been handed over to afghan government forces 
several hundred soviet soldiers are still hanging on to guard the 
kabul airport but they are to leave by next week 
the rest of the thousands of red army troops who were around the 
capital three weeks ago are home or on their way either in convoys 
heading up the snowy salang highway to the soviet border or on huge 
military transport planes 
moslem guerrillas have launched few rocket attacks on kabul and 
the government shelling of guerrilla hideouts in the mountains has 
tapered off 
on the surface at least kabul is calm 
the markets bustle with women clad in traditional chadris the 
allenveloping veil that cascades in pleats from a skullcap with a 
coarse mesh panel over the eyes 
children slide down the icy hills and fly kites in the street 
smokebelching buses and hornblaring taxis jam the narrow 
streets 
carts filled with fresh bananas and oranges from neighboring 
pakistan and pomegranates and apples from other parts of afghanistan 
mask for a few seconds the stench of impoverished humanity 
on chicken street the main venue for foreigners and the wealthy 
merchants sell everything from centuriesold carpets and antique 
muskets to swiss watches and german beer 
goods are still coming in there is plenty of food and other 
goods all you need is the money to pay said a merchant who 
identified himself only as tamoor 
the soviet armored personnel carriers that a few days ago stood 
at the end of chicken street are gone in their place are afghan 
soldiers clutching a sovietdesigned kalashnikov rifle in one hand 
and prayer beads in the other 
few signs remain of moscows nineyear military intervention 
except for the volga and moskvich cars fur hats vodka and russian 
caviar which has nearly tripled in price since the final soviet 
withdrawal started in early january 
afghans openly voice their hostility toward soviets and look upon 
foreigners with suspicion 
where are you from qurban ali asked a group of westerners 
england one of them answered 
forgive me ali said motioning the group inside his carpet 
shop i thought you were russian 
for the citys 350000 poor people things are not so comfortable 
a soviet airlift and attacks on guerrillas blocking the salang 
highway have eased shortages of flour but lines persist at the 
shacks where bread is sold the poorest people survive on diets of 
bread rice and tea 
heating oil and fuel are even scarcer making a bitter winter 
even harder 
a liter of gasoline sells on the black market for 175 to 500 
afghanis 320 to 910 at the official exchange rate compared to 
30 afghanis 55 cents at the official rate for the scarce and 
tightly rationed government supplies 
i had to walk seven kilometers four miles to work today 
said a government interpreter its best to live near the trolley

the new government of coup leader gen 
andres rodriguez is investigating allegations of financial 
irregularities involving public funds controlled by deposed 
president alfredo stroessner 
stroessner ruler of this landlocked south american country since 
1954 was ousted from power friday in a coup engineered by 
rodriguez about 50 people died in the takeover and stroessner was 
sent in exile sunday to brazil 
charges of corruption under stroesser were widespread opposition 
politicians once persecuted and now allowed to speak freely have 
called for the creation of a commission to recover funds misspent 
under the old regime 
attorney pedro abilio rolon filed a suit monday charging three 
former government ministers and stroessners longtime personal 
secretary mario abdo benitez of using public funds and accepting 
bribes to obtain mansions apartments and autos rolon sought an 
embargo on their local bank accounts 
that action was followed tuesday by gen juan antonio caceres 
former minister of public works who alleged that stroessner 
personally controlled at least two accounts funded by public money 
on wednesday the central bank announced it was going to 
control withdrawals from accounts of some government 
institutions 
caceres noted stroessner 76 had signature power over funds 
exceeding 4 million revenues from highway tolls and gasoline 
taxes 
caceres said he didnt know what stroessner used the money for 
but that in general the funds were not available for use by his 
ministry 
a paraguayan businessman with close contacts in the banking 
industry said government officials loyal to stroessner wrote and 
hurriedly tried to cash checks written on government accounts 
immediately following his ouster 
aldo zuccolillo publisher of the newspaper abc color which was 
closed by stroessner but hopes to reopen this month said the 
central bank measure was good intelligent 
this was taxpayers money being administered as though it were 
a personal checking account zuccolillo said adding there must 
be dozens more accounts like this linked to other government 
ministries in staterun companies 
the central bank said the reason for the measure which could 
cause delays in the payment of some government checks was to 
obtain better control and greater clarification of the destination 
and correct application of public funds 
luis ortiz secretary to new economy minister enzo de bernardi 
said the bank would review all checks written by government 
officials who no are longer government officials de bernardi is 
in charge of the bank 
in a separate development he told reporters paraguays foreign 
debt amounts to 2 billion and there dont appear to be funds to 
keep making payments the last payment was made in december he said 
the treasury needs funds and if we do not find them well have 
to talk with our creditors he said 
foreign minister luis maria argana declined to blame stroessner 
he was a great president for many years said argana who 
under stroessner served as president of the supreme court 
unfortunately during the last two years he was surrounded by a 
group of totally irresponsible greedy politicians totally lacking 
in patriotism

for the first time in more than 40 
years an independent daily newspaper has begun publishing in this 
soviet bloc nation the latest sign of an increasing tolerance for 
openness in hungarian media 
the first issue of mai nap today contained an article that said 
the 1956 uprising should be commemorated with a national and 
historic holiday 
publication of the article plunged the 24page tabloid which is 
competing with budapests official esti hirlap into a controversy 
over the revolt that was crushed by soviet tanks 
imre pozsgay a leading reformer in the communist partys ruling 
politburo last month called it a popular uprising 
party leader karoly grosz and several senior officials opposed to 
hungarys fastmoving reform movement rebuked pozsgay insisting on 
maintaining the official line that the rising was a 
counterrevolution to destroy communism 
on monday the staterun mti news agency carried statements by 
official and independent groups backing the widely popular pozsgay 
the policysetting central committee is to discuss the issue on 
friday at a session that could result in major leadership changes 
last weekend the daughter of imre nagy the premier who led the 
revolt and widows of two nagy colleagues who were executed with him 
for roles in the uprising called for a public reburial of the three 
it was in this atmosphere that mai nap began serializing the 
hitherto unpublished memoirs of the late zoltan vas a senior party 
official 
in the memoirs vas stands up for nagy and for nagys aim to 
set up a typically hungarian economic and political new socialist 
state system and a new page in the history of hungarian 
socialism 
the memoirs quote janos kadar the longtime party leader 
installed by the soviets in 1956 as denouncing the 
counterrevolution as an armed uprising against state order and 
institutions 
vas as quoted by mai nap said in the memoirs in my view 
even if kadar then so saw oct 23 1956 the start of the uprising 
this day is a national and historic holiday of the hungarian people 
like march 15 1848 
that date marked the start of the hungarian uprising against the 
hapsburg monarchy like the 1956 revolt against communist rule it 
was suppressed 
according to mai nap officials detained vas in february 1973 on 
the grounds his memoirs contained antisoviet sedition when vas 
told investigators a copy had been deposited abroad he was soon 
freed the daily reported 
the independent tabloid which also featured many photographs and 
sports stories costs 17 cents a copy well above the price of esti 
hirlap

navajo chairman peter mcdonald accused 
of taking kickbacks in tribe transactions said his observance of 
indian tradition in accepting gifts was minor compared to the 
excesses of washington politicians 
in a 25minute hookup with tribal radio station ktnn wednesday 
peter macdonald lashed out at former first lady nancy reagan 
congress in general and members of the senate select committee on 
indian affairs which is investigating allegations of bribery in his 
administration 
i dont need designer dresses loaned to me like nancy reagan 
nobody is offering me 5000 a night for speaking engagements 
macdonald told radio listeners during a visit to crownpoint nm 
for a shopping center dedication 
he declined to answer reporters questions later 
macdonald was acquitted in 1977 of federal fraud and 
incometaxevasion charges according to testimony before the senate 
committee the 60yearold chairman of the nations largest tribe 
has profited from kickbacks in a variety of official navajo 
transactions including the 334 million purchase of the big 
boquillas ranch 
macdonald said the senate probe was racist and aimed at 
undermining tribal sovereignty 
they are the gentlemen who are investigating my ethics of 
serving without one scrap of evidence that the favors i have 
received somehow mean i have sold out the tribe he said this 
is wrong this is wrong this is wrong 
yes i have accepted gifts but that is not a crime he said 
mcdonald has been invited to testify but has not appeared before 
the committee which began its inquiry last year after the arizona 
republic published articles alleging waste and corruption on 
reservations and in federal indian programs 
the investigation threatened tribal sovereignty because the 
government was near to denying navajos the right to enter into 
binding contracts macdonald said 
an estimated 170000 of the nations 200000 navajos live on the 
25000squaremile reservation that covers much of northeastern 
arizona and sprawls into northwestern new mexico and southeastern 
utah 
bryon t bud brown a phoenix real estate broker has 
testified under a grant of immunity that he paid macdonald 25000 
to amortize a bank loan gave him 50000 in cash and made a 50000 
bmw automobile available as his share of the 72 million profit 
realized by browns friend on the sale of the big boquillas 
brown had arranged for businessman tom tracy to buy the ranch 
from tenneco west inc for 262 million a few hours later the 
tribe paid 334 million for the 491000acre spread in western 
arizona 
the account was corroborated before the committee by mcdonalds 
son peter mcdonald jr also testifying under immunity 
macdonald told listeners too much emphasis had been placed on how 
the land was acquired ignoring that the land could generate a 
profit 
because i supported and devoted the greatest land acquisition 
in the history of the navajo people im supposed to have sold out 
to have betrayed my people well let me tell you this i didnt 
need any favors from bud brown

a substance made from two natural proteins blocks 
aids virus infection in the test tube and may prod the body into 
fighting the virus scientists reported today 
one protein called cd4 is already in human testing for its 
ability to block infection but it may stay in the bloodstream 
longer if fused to the other protein researchers said 
in addition this hybrid could bind to special sites on white 
blood cells in the test tube suggesting that in people it may 
trigger an immune system attack on the virus and aidsinfected blood 
cells researchers said 
results of experiments with the hybrid called cd4 immunoadhesin 
appear in todays issue of the british journal nature the work was 
done by scientists from genentech inc of south san francisco the 
national cancer institute and the new england deaconess hospital in 
boston 
cd4 is normally found on the surface of some blood cells the 
virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome binds to cd4 
as an inital step in infecting those cells 
recent studies suggest that unattached cd4 can act as a decoy 
that uses up the specialized binding sites on the aids virus 
leaving the virus unable to infect blood cells 
but in their nature report researchers said animal studies 
suggest that cd4 may be eliminated quickly from the human 
bloodstream half of any given amount may be gone within a half hour 
to two hours a measure called halflife they said 
researchers fused the cd4 molecule to part of another human 
protein called an antibody in rabbits this hybrid stayed in the 
bloodstream up to nearly 200 times longer than cd4 the researchers 
said 
in people its halflife may be about three weeks they said 
the hybrid also blocked aids infection of blood cells in the test 
tube researchers said 
the research is a very logical approach for extending 
halflife but that may also be achieved in other ways said robert 
schooley of harvard medical school 
schooley who is testing cd4 in humans also cautioned that the 
usefulness of using cd4 alone or attached to other substances has 
not yet been determined

freshman applications are down at top colleges 
around the country for the first time in years the likely outcome 
of a dwindling number of high school graduates and everhigher 
tuitions admissions officers say 
the decline in graduating high school students is considered the 
prime culprit according to more than a dozen admissions officers 
interviewed since feb 1 the deadline for fall freshman 
applications at many of the nations most competitive schools 
since this is happening to everyone the best guess is that 
its demographics said michael c behnke admissions director of 
the massachusetts institute of technology where applications are 
down 10 percent from a year ago 
but some officials suspect that students and their families may 
finally be reacting to tuition increases that have consistently 
exceeded the nations overall inflation rate throughout the 1980s 
i think theres a great possibility that tuitions are a part of 
it said linda davis taylor admissions director of amherst 
college where applications are off by 4 percent from last year i 
dont know of any topic thats being discussed more by boards of 
trustees 
the number of high school seniors has dropped steadily from 3 
million in 1980 to 276 million in 1988 and is expected to bottom 
out at 244 million by 1992 
an unexpected increase in the ranks of older students and higher 
percentages of high school students attending college helped offset 
that decline in the number of 18yearolds thus to the surprise of 
many college enrollments grew from 121 million to 125 million 
since 1980 and were up at 54 percent of the nations colleges and 
universities according to an annual survey by the american council 
on education 
but college officials believe that the drop in applications for 
next falls freshman class is the first sign that the longexpected 
decline in enrollment is about to arrive 
harvard university spokesman peter costa estimates a 510 percent 
drop in applications the first such decline in at least two 
decades brown university and most other ivy league schools are 
reporting similar declines 
stanford universitys fall applications have dropped 6 percent 
from 15828 to 14869 according to lynne madison assistant dean of 
undergraduate admissions 
at university of california at berkeley applications are also 
down from 21944 to 20835 for next falls entering class 
i consider this a yellow light we all kind of anticipated 
this said bradley quin admissions director of lafayette college 
in easton pa where applications are down about 5 percent i 
dont mean to imply that were not concerned this is a competitive 
business and its going to make it that much harder to increase the 
quality of our classes 
apart from the population changes school officials say students 
may also be cutting down on the number of schools they apply to 
following a decade in which multiple applications increased sharply 
an annual survey of entering freshmen by the american council on 
education and the university of california at los angeles found that 
a record 37 percent applied to at least three colleges in fall 1988 
compared with 26 percent in 1980 
that increase has generally been attributed to students wanting 
to improve their odds of getting into a top school and to shopping 
around for the best financial aid deals as tuitions have soared 
but students are apparently starting to think twice about 
submitting a dozen or more applications now that application fees 
have hit 40 50 and more 
when you start talking about 50 fees you get more 
selective said sanford rivers associate director of admissions 
at carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh

many alcoholics can be treated for their addiction 
just as effectively and much more cheaply at outpatient clinics 
rather than hospital treatment wards a study today concludes 
the report found that people suffering from mild to moderate 
symptoms of alcohol withdrawal stay off booze just as long when 
treated as outpatients those who went into the hospital were more 
likely to get through the initial program but after six months 
those treated as outpatients were doing just as well 
the study directed by dr motoi hayashida was conducted at the 
veterans administration medical center in philadelphia and published 
in the new england journal of medicine 
we conclude that outpatient medical detoxification is an 
effective safe and lowcost treatment for patients with mild to 
moderate symptoms of alcohol withdrawal the researchers wrote 
the conclusions were based on 164 men who had volunteered for 
treatment of alcohol withdrawal they were randomly assigned to the 
outpatient program or to hospital admission 
those treated as outpatients were given the drug oxazepam and 
asked to report to a hospital clinic each day where their blood 
alcohol levels were measured and they were asked whether or not they 
had been drinking 
the cost for the outpatients ranged from 175 to 388 while for 
those in the hospital it ranged from 3319 to 3665 
seventytwo percent of the outpatients and 95 percent of those 
admitted to the hospital successfully completed detoxification 
however after six months there was no significant difference 
between the two treatment approaches about half of the men in both 
groups said they had stayed sober 
in an accompanying editorial dr gerald l klerman of new york 
hospitalcornell medical center said that several comparison studies 
are being conducted to look at alcohol treatment programs 
the results indicate that the majority of patients with mild to 
moderate withdrawal symptoms do not require hospitalization but can 
be treated safely and effectively as outpatients with considerable 
cost savings he wrote

after nearly a decade of political 
asylum in the venezuelan embassy two former highranking officers 
in the army of the ousted somoza regime were permitted to leave and 
flew to guatemala 
col carlos o gutierrez and capt mario guerra palacios arrived 
in guatemala city wednesday night aboard a commercial flight from 
managua they were greeted by a venezuelan diplomat and taken to a 
nearby hotel 
diplomatic sources in guatemala told the associated press the 
pair would remain in guatemala a few days and that they planned to 
seek political asylum in the united states the sources spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the two fled to the venezuelan embassy in july 1979 the same 
month the leftist sandinista national liberation front took power 
after a popular uprising ousted president anastasio somoza 
gutierrez 62 and guerra 42 were members of the nowdisbanded 
national guard as the army was known under somoza 
known as the ranger because of his us military training 
gutierrez was one of somozas trusted officers he had suffered two 
heart attacks in confinement and said in a 1986 interview that the 
only way out was if the united states comes in and wipes these 
communists out 
either that or we will end up dying here he had said 
guerra kept himself busy by studying radio and television repair 
and completed a correspondence course in electronics in 1986 
in managua the opposition newspaper la prensa on wednesday 
quoted unidentified sources as saying the foreign ministry gave the 
two a oneyear exit permit instead of the customary safeconduct 
pass 
repeated telephone calls to the foreign ministry and the 
venezuelan embassy in managua went unanswered reporters were kept 
away from several venezuelan diplomats gathered at managuas cesar 
augusto sandino international airport before the pair left 
allowing the officers to leave was seen as a gesture of goodwill 
toward the united states by the sandinista government which is 
trying to cope with a rapidly deteriorating economy inflation 
reached 20000 percent in 1988 
the government has blamed economic problems on eight years of war 
with the usbacked contra rebels hurricane joan which struck the 
atlantic coast last october and a us trade embargo since 1985 
president daniel ortega is scheduled to attend a summit of 
central american presidents next week in el salvador the meeting 
postponed many times was called under a regional peace plan signed 
by ortega and the presidents of el salvador honduras guatemala

fresh from victory over their rivals in the 
iranianbacked hezbollah the militiamen of the shiite moslem amal 
appear to control south lebanon 
the countrys south is divided into strips 
first there is the israelicontrolled security zone along the 
border then an area patrolled by the un interim force in lebanon 
then the amal zone running up to sidon 35 miles north of the 
israeli border 
leaders of amal say their control over south lebanon means they 
can also control attacks on israeli soldiers in the security zone 
israel proclaimed near its border in south lebanon but they would 
not strike at targets in israel 
no one is allowed to hold weapons or wear military clothes in 
south lebanon except amal said ali kreiss the local amal 
political chief amal is responsible for the security of everyone 
in south lebanon 
the un peacekeepers numbering 5800 have been in lebanon 
since a 1978 israeli invasion israel set up its security zone in 
1985 
kreiss said amals responsibility for security in south lebanon 
was laid out in agreements signed over the last three months with 
the hezbollah or party of god and the palestine liberation 
organization 
before the agreements hundreds were killed in fighting with the 
plo for control of palestinian refugee camps and with hezbollah for 
mastery of south lebanon and beiruts shiite southern suburbs 
the agreement means amal has rid itself of direction from 
outside from other countries kreiss said indirectly sneering at 
hezbollah dependence on iran he claimed syrian backing for amal did 
not represent influence but relations 
kreiss said four longstanding amal tenets were included in the 
agreement all lebanon must remain unified amal must have charge of 
the souths security no attacks may be carried out on un forces 
and no foreigners may be kidnapped 
to underscore the last point amal security chief mohammed harkus 
had his men take western journalists on a tour of tyre including 
ancient roman ruins 
led by a jeep with wailing siren a convoy of four cars pushed 
through snarled traffic 
a small measure of amals control was that the siren persuaded 
drivers to give way militias most often fire automatic rifles in 
the air to clear traffic 
along the roads amal checkpoints monitored traffic and the 
militias green symbol was plastered on walls along with posters of 
the late amal leader of south lebanon daoud daoud who was killed 
in last septembers amalhezbollah fighting 
in tyre a city of 50000 10 miles north of israels border 
people appear less grim than when hezbollahs power was on the rise 
and one cafe advertised live music the tehranbacked hardliners 
had banned music ordered booze off store shelves and papered walls 
with posters of irans ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
a stop for coffee by the journalists at an outdoor cafe drew 
curious lebanese unaccustomed to seeing foreigners in anarchic south 
lebanon

a man accused of murdering 14 family 
members in a 1987 christmastime rampage had a lovehate 
relationship with one of his daughters that might explain some of 
the killings a prosecutor said 
r gene simmons 48 should be sentenced to death for strangling 
and shooting his relatives prosecutor john bynum said in his 
opening statements wednesday 
bynum said the prosecution would present a note written by 
simmons that authorities found in a bank safe deposit box 
it will show you and indicate to you a motive as to why mr 
simmons killed some of these people specifically his oldest 
daughter sheila her husband and 6yearold daughter sylvia and 
simmons wife becky 46 said bynum 
it will describe a lovehate relationship with this daughter 
bynum told the jury relatives say simmons fathered sylvia 
the defense attorney robert e doc irwin told the jury to 
forget past publicity about the case 
i want to ask you to be the most careful and most courageous 
jury that ever sat in this county perhaps in this state in behalf 
of the defendant irwin said 
bynum described how investigators found the bodies of simmons 
wife seven children two of their spouses and four grandchildren at 
the simmons house north of dover 25 miles southeast of clarksville 
they found five bodies in the house on dec 28 1987 and the 
next day found seven bodies in a grave and the bodies of two babies 
in the trunks of cars 
authorities found the bodies after arresting simmons for a 
40minute shooting spree that left two dead and four wounded in 
russellville 
simmons has been convicted and sentenced to death for the two 
russellville murders he has asked to be executed as soon as 
possible but an opponent of capital punishment has appealed the 
sentence 
bynum said ballistics tests showed that a pistol simmons handed 
over to former russellville police chief herb johnston upon his 
arrest was the same one used to kill five relatives 
irwin told the jury there was no evidence to link simmons with 
the pistol before he handed it over and no evidence on simmons 
whereabouts during the period when the deaths occurred 
he would have to be around those people to kill them the 
attorney said 
about 100 spectators crowded into the courtroom at the johnson 
county courthouse where the trial was moved from russellville 
because of publicity about the case 
a dozen relatives of the victims sat on two benches in the front 
of the courtroom several wept as bynum told the jury the names of 
those slain and how they died

amos n andy the comic characters who 
made holy mackrel an american catch phrase but deeply offended 
many blacks may be coming out of retirement for a broadway revival 
a federal appeals panel has cleared the way for writer stephen 
silverman to produce a stage show based on the famous pair who were 
featured on one of the most famous radio and television shows of its 
era 
the duos broadway debut still could be stopped if cbs which 
owns many of the rights to the characters takes the case to the 
us supreme court george schweitzer senior vicepresident of 
communications for cbs said the network was reviewing that option 
but silverman who wrote the script for fresh air taxi a 
musical stage show that takes its name from the company amos and 
andy ran said he was going ahead 
ive rewritten the script and now im looking for a producer 
he said wednesday two days after the 2nd circuit court of appeals 
overturned a lower court decision on trademark rights to the 
characters 
the amos n andy show was introduced on radio in the 1920s 
when the black characters were all played by whites 
andy brown amos jones algonquin j calhoun kingfish sapphire 
and the shows other characters came to television on cbs in 1951 
and were portrayed by blacks 
cbs pulled the show off the air in 1964 in response to complaints 
by black viewers who were offended by the ethnic stereotyping of the 
characters 
silverman a former newspaper columnist who wrote the recent 
the fox that got away and an upcoming biography on director 
david lean said he first thought of an amos n andy musical in 
1981 
he said he tried to contact cbs over use of the characters but 
was continually rebuffed or ignored 
in a lawsuit filed in 1984 silverman argued that cbs had 
abandoned its trademarks by no longer using the characters 
in august 1987 us district judge gerard goettel ruled in favor 
of cbs saying that although the network had not used the properties 
or revealed plans for their use it wanted to hold the option 
but the threejudge appeals panel noted that when the issue came 
to court the amos n andy trademarks hadnt been used for 21 
years 
the judges ruled that the trademarks cannot be protected if use 
was discontinued for more than 20 years a bare assertion of 
possible future use is not enough the panel said 
the judges did uphold the networks rights to all scripts 
produced after 1948 when cbs purchased the rights from the shows 
originators 
but the ruling allows silverman or anyone else to use any 
characters connected with the show before 1948 as well as such 
phrases from the show as holy mackrel aint dat sumpin and 
scuse me for protrudin

rock hudson never told his homosexual lover 
that he had aids because the actor thought he had been cured of the 
fatal disease an attorney for hudsons estate said 
i dont think he believed he had the aids virus in his blood 
anymore attorney robert mills said during closing arguments 
wednesday in an 11 million lawsuit filed by marc christian 
hudsons former lover against the actors estate 
mills rebutted claims by christian that hudson had deliberately 
hid his illness from his lover saying you dont tell someone you 
have something that you dont believe you have 
christian 35 an aspiring musician who lived with hudson in the 
last two years of his life contends he is entitled to compensation 
for the enhanced fear he suffered when he found out that his 
lover had aids 
but mills said that hudson who had been undergoing treatment in 
france with an antiaids drug was told by a doctor there that he 
was free of aids shortly before a final bout with the disease 
that killed him 
the attorney also argued that christian lied when he said he had 
sex with hudson about 160 times between 1983 and 1985 mills said it 
would have been impossible for christian not to have contracted the 
disease under those circumstances and suggested the tryst between 
the two men ended long before hudson was diagnosed as having aids 
he said christian has tested negative repeatedly in tests for 
exposure to the aids virus 
earlier christians lawyer harold rhoden told jurors that when 
hudson and christian became lovers in 1983 this was a different 
world as far as aids was concerned and christian had no fears 
if they had met today there might be an argument that he 
should have known better rhoden said in his final argument to the 
jury but they met in 1982 all the world knew was that homosexual 
men were dying in new york and san francisco all there was was 
speculation about what this thing was that was killing gay men 
there was talk of gay cancer 
in 1983 when the men became lovers rhoden said there was no 
reason to use a condom there was no reason for marc christian to 
believe he could get aids from hudson 
hudson who played the leading man to such actresses as doris 
day elizabeth taylor and linda evans in movies and tv died on oct 
5 1985 a few months after his battle with aids became public 
christian claims that he wasnt told about hudsons disease until 
the public announcement that the star was dying

jurors began considering 29 charges 
including attempted murder burglary and arson against a man accused 
in a series of sniper attacks 
the jury asked superior court judge dominic f cresto to explain 
which of approximately 75 exhibits including a gun bullet 
fragments and casings allegedly used in the snipings related to 
each of the various charges against suspect peter t trepanier 
before retiring to a downtown hotel wednesday evening the jury 
also asked cresto to repeat the definition of assault with intent 
to commit murder 
trepanier 25 is charged with six counts of assault with intent 
to commit murder and six counts of conspiracy to commit murder in 
connection with nighttime sniper attacks in northern rhode island 
between dec 8 1986 and jan 8 1987

burglary seven counts of burglary and three of firstdegree arson 
in connection with a string of housebreaks and fires in the late 
spring of 1987 
he faces a maximum penalty of life in prison if convicted on the 
arson charges 
in his closing argument defense lawyer john j hardiman said the 
prosecution had produced no evidence linking trepanier to the 
shootings he said trepanier confessed to a friend because he was a 
jokester a prankster and wanted to get attention 
prosecutor eva marie mancuso said trepanier had committed the 
sniper attacks in a reckless manner and reckless is intent to 
murder 
who picked up the rifle each and every time and looked in the 
scope and pulled the trigger and watched the people fall mancuso 
asked the jurors 
russell ducharme ii a high school classmate faces virtually the 
same list of charges and will be tried later

famed conductor herbert von karajan has asked for a 
reprieve from his contract with the berlin philharmonic orchestra 
because of failing health officials said today 
the 80yearold conductor wrote berlin culture authorities that 
he is unable to keep up with the pace demanded by his contract and 
wants to rest at his home near salzburg austria 
he needs to reduce his workload and has submitted the 
recommendations of three doctors to that effect said ludwig von 
pufendorf berlin secretary for cultural affairs 
pufendorf said karajans request was nothing dramatic because 
the austrian conductor has been ill for years 
but with the letter karajan conceded for the first time that his 
ability to conduct has been affected by a stroke failing vision 
circulatory problems and at least five operations he has undergone 
in the last 12 years 
pufendorf said karajans obligations with the berlin symphony had 
been reduced to 6 concerts per year from 12 as earlier was required 
karajan has conducted the berlin philharmonic since 1954 and 
holds the honorary title of lifetime director 
he is also lifetime director of viennas friends of music society 
and has regularly conducted the vienna state opera and salzburg and 
lucerne music festivals 
karajan underwent a ninehour operation in 1976 and had surgery 
again in 1979 he has been visibly hindered since a 1983 operation 
on his spinal column and two later operations to remove tumors 
he has required a supporting chair behind the conducting pulpit 
for more than a year and is reported by orchestra members to be so 
farsighted that he cannot read music anymore and conducts from 
memory he also suffers from a hearing problem 
karajan asked in the letter to berlin cultural affairs senator 
volker hassemer for a break from his concert duties noting he 
continues to suffer circulatory problems as a result of the stroke 
and influenza contracted last year 
karajans health is not what it used to be hassemer said 
his life is a heroic exertion against illness and pain a 
vienna music critic commented

a new york financier and a florida businessman 
have been indicted for allegedly faking more than 38 billion in 
trades in us government securities in a massive tax fraud scheme 
there were no real transactions it was all pieces of paper 
going back and forth us attorney benito romano said wednesday 
it was an entirely fictitious operation 
romano said the case which allegedly involved 511 million in 
illegal tax writeoffs was at least as large as any previous case of 
its type 
jon edelman 43 of rye ny and bernhard f manko 48 of 
lighthouse point fla were charged with conspiracy to defraud the 
internal revenue service and numerous counts of making false 
statements to the irs or aiding others to do so 
edelman the brother of prominent takeover strategist asher 
edelman issued a statement calling the charges unfounded unfair 
and unjust i am confident that i will be completely vindicated 
by the jury that will hear my case he said 
mankos lawyer pamela rogers chepiga said she hadnt yet 
reviewed the indictment but based on what has come to our 
attention during this long investigation we believe mr manko will 
be entirely vindicated 
the investors were unwitting participants in the scheme and 
arent under investigation romano said although they may have to 
undergo civil audits to determine whether they owe back taxes 
the investors include billionaire john kluge the chairman of 
metromedia co 
kevin obrien an attorney for kluge confirmed his client and 
kluges wife patricia had invested in two edelmanmanko 
partnerships he said irs audits of the partnerships have been 
going on for years and that a settlement with all the partners to 
cover back taxes was being implemented 
among other investors listed in the indictment was a perry ellis 
prosecutors would not confirm if it was the late fashion designer 
and calls to a spokesman for elliss company were not returned 
asher edelman was not implicated in the alleged scheme through a 
spokeswoman maureen connelly he issued a statement this is a 
distressing and difficult time for our family i will do everything 
in my power to assist my brother because i do not believe he would 
engage in any unlawful activity 
jon edelman and manko were accused of creating more than 38 
billion in prearranged rigged and fraudulent transactions in 
government securities to generate losses for investors in numerous 
limited partnerships which the investors could write off against 
their taxes the scheme involved at least 15 partnerships between 
1982 and 1986 the indictment charges 
both manko and edelman were charged with conspiracy which 
carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a 10000 fine 
manko was charged with 24 false statement counts and edelman was 
charged with 25 similar counts each of which carries up to three 
years in prison and a 5000 fine 
the pair also was accused of creating false trading and financing 
confirmations causing the distribution of fraudulent sales 
literature and misleading lawyers who prepared offering materials 
and signed tax opinion letters for some of the limited partnerships

suspended a threeday strike today and lech walesa appealed to 
workers not to strike while he tries to negotiate solidaritys 
reinstatement 
give a chance to the round table the chairman of the free 
trade union movement said in an interview on state radio just hours 
after the miners ended the stoppage that had threatened to shut down 
the belchatow plants generators 
lech walesa is appealing for a chance for the round table we 
have been waiting for so many years we can wait a few days more 
he said 
walesa had dispatched an envoy to help settle the dispute 
he joined a working group on trade union issues that began talks 
today as part of historic round table talks between the 
opposition and government that opened monday and are expected to 
last up to six weeks 
belchatow is just another proof that we should reach agreement 
on the most important things as soon as possible and restore the 
organization called solidarity walesa said in the radio interview 
the decision to suspend the strike at belchatow until feb 28 
followed a visit to the mine 90 miles southwest of warsaw by an 
envoy for walesa and managements agreement to provide most of the 
pay raise sought by strikers state radio reported 
the strike had reduced coal supplies at belchatow to about two 
days reserves the strip mine at the complex fuels the plants 
generators which produce onefifth of polands electricity 
state radio said management raised pay by 41 a month compared 
to the 59 monthly raise sought by the 4000 strikers on average 
workers at the plant earn 145 monthly 
government spokesman jerzy urban had on wednesday had accused 
walesas envoy aloyzy pietrzyk of encouraging the strike at a 
rally attended by thousands of workers rather than trying to ease it

thursdays child a sloop on pace to smash 
the 135year new yorksan francisco sailing record did not have far 
to go as it entered waters off southern california today 
the modern threeman 60foot racing yacht was seeking to beat 
the record of 89 days and eight hours for the 14500mile journey 
around treacherous cape horn at the tip of south america set in 
1854 by the legendary threemasted clipper ship flying cloud it is 
the oldest existing speed record 
thursdays child was expected to reach the latitude of san diego 
early today and was on target to enter san franciscos golden gate 
on friday or saturday morning at the latest spokesman tony lush 
said wednesday after a radio conference with the crew 
the vessel left new york nov 23 and must reach san francisco by 
2 am pst on feb 21 to break the record a friday arrival would do 
that by 10 days 
the race is against what was called the liveliest creation of 
man a clipper ship praised in its day as a thing of satisfying 
beauty absolutely fitted for the purpose it is designed to 
fill 
the 225foot flying cloud required 100 men to hoist 35 sails up 
its masts thursdays child is 165 feet shorter and has only two 
sails but it boasts the latest in pushbutton satellite navigation 
equipment 
courtney hazelton 32 a professional sailor is its skipper 
ownermaster warren luhrs 44 and lars bergstrom 54 who helped 
design the boat also are aboard 
lush said all were in good health with adequate water and food 
supplies 
even a fiveday interruption at the falkland islands in the south 
atlantic to repair damage from a belowwaterline collision with an 
unknown object failed to knock the vessel off record pace 
the boat was enjoying unusual southeasterly winds of up to nearly 
30 mph according to weather forecaster sharon alden she estimated 
the favorable winds would persist at least another day 
the prevailing wind along the west coast is from the northwest 
which slows northbound sailboats 
the flying cloud was one of the class of clipper ships whose 
development was spurred by the california and australian gold rushes 
and the china tea trade their nickname is believed to derive from 
the phrase going at a clip 
five other sailboats have been sunk since 1982 while trying to 
navigate the chaotic waters and stiff winds at the tip of south 
america

it didnt look like happy trails for cbs but 
lonesome dove has ridden to the rescue 
the success of cbs fournight western has not only boosted 
morale at the thirdplace network but sent audience shares of cbs 
abc and nbc soaring into the 80s in a season that has been averaging 
percentages in the 60s 
on his cbs talk show tuesday pat sajak told his audience they 
might find it a little warmer than previously 
with the success of lonesome dove he said cbs has 
turned the heat back on in the studio 
lonesome dove has more than met cbs guarantee to 
advertisers televisions in an estimated 257 million homes were 
tuned to cbs for the series first installment 
instead of the lessthan30 share the network expected the 
miniseries is headed for an average share closer to 40 the share is 
a percentage of televisions in use 
its performing significantly better than we anticipated 
though obviously we had great hopes for it because of the quality 
said david poltrack cbs vice president for marketing the recent 
patterns of television viewing would create a healthy skepticism in 
terms of response and were very pleased 
the audience reception shows that networks can still put on good 
programs and people will watch 
lonesome dove tom shales of the washington post enthused 
is enough to give one new respect for the miniseries new respect 
for texas new respect for cbs and even new respect for television 
there is almost never anything this good on network tv 
it is the best western ever on the small screen wrote art 
chapman of the fort worth texas startelegram it is the best 
miniseries we have seen in 10 years and it is the best overall show 
of the last few seasons 
the fourpart series that concluded wednesday night is based on 
larry mcmurtrys 1985 pulitzer prizewinning novel of the same name 
the tale of life death and love on a texastomontana cattle 
drive had an allstar cast including oscar winners robert duvall 
tender mercies and anjelica huston prizzis honor emmy 
winner tommy lee jones executioners song diane lane robert 
urich ricky schroder danny glover db sweeney chris cooper and 
glenne headly 
what it tells you is basically that quality will bring out 
audiences said poltrack now on the other hand you dont run 
out and make 10 miniseries based on this because you have to 
realize youre dealing with pulitzer prizewinning book an 
extraordinary production extraordinary acting i think the robert 
duvall performance will go down in history as one of the great 
television performances of all time when you have that kind of 
combination youre going to be successful 
alan wurtzel abcs vice president for research said i would 
say its a little dangerous to draw any conclusions about the future 
of either westerns on television or the future of the long 
miniseries on television based on one case i think if theres 
nothing else you learn in television its that theres always the 
exception to the rule 
last season the networks began fretting about the loss of 
viewers to cable options and videocassettes the slide stopped at 
least for this week 
sunday nights premiere of lonesome dove had a 285 rating 
and a 42 share and was the highestrated show of the week according 
to the ac nielsen co whose weekly ratings compilations run 
mondays through sundays each rating point represents 904000 us 
homes with televisions monday and tuesdays installments drew a 37 
share each 
abc and nbc might be losing the time period to lonesome dove 
but the competition is not doing badly and a hit for one is 
ultimately good for all three networks 
its always been my contention as far as the network business 
is concerned three healthy networks are really preferable i would 
just like to be the healthiest of the three but its really to no 
ones advantage to have one or two networks not performing well 
said wurtzel 
poor programming on any network chases viewers to cable and video 
alternatives he said 
but theres also a sense of tipping the hat when a competitor 
comes up with something really special lonesome dove wurtzel 
said is an excellent very very welldone show and i think it 
deserves to get viewers

a leningrad magazine has published a daring attack 
on the soviet communist party including unusually pointed criticism 
of the way president mikhail s gorbachev is running the country 
sergei y andreyev the author of the essay in the january 
edition of neva said gorbachevs reforms have failed to solve the 
soviet economic crisis 
the article is one of the harshest and most detailed attacks yet 
on the communist system gorbachev and perestroika his reform 
program 
andreyev said in the literary and political magazine that 
gorbachevs reforms are seriously hampered by what he called a new 
class 
all decisions of the upper powers are carried out only to the 
extent that they are advantageous to the new class andreyev said 
in the 28page essay 
he said the new class is a production and managerial 
apparatus that includes 14 million party bureaucrats government 
ministers and managers 
andreyevs use of the term new class appeared to be a 
reference to milovan djilas book the new class which 
criticized the communist system 
the yugoslav politican and writer who broke with yugoslavias 
leadership said in the 1957 book that the communist system had 
produced a new class of privileged leaders instead of a classless 
society 
gorbachev himself has launched a war on bureaucrats who interfere 
in daytoday decisions about production and he has tried to 
transfer some of their power to local officials and factory managers 
but andreyev said gorbachev hasnt gone far enough and that the 
government and party have become subservient to the new class 
andreyev 34 is a biologist and plant director who said he 
represents a new political club called alternative his article 
mocks the partys claim of popular support and uses the colloquial 
gensec as an abbreviation for general secretary gorbachevs 
post in the party 
the new class he wrote is largely responsible for the lack of 
major improvements in the soviet economy and for impediments to 
democracy that have arisen since gorbachev came to power in march 
1985 and the next month launched his perestroika program 
we must admit the economy is in a crisis for the years 
since the memorable april plenum of the communist party central 
committee the economy didnt get on track the crisis in this 
way is deepening he said 
perestroika is moving slowly not because of some mysterious 
forces but because of wellorganized sabotage he said 
gorbachev has acknowledged that perestroika is not moving as 
quickly as he had hoped but he has reaffirmed his commitment to 
reform and said the people support his reforms 
andreyev however said the current leadership is partly to blame 
for the countrys economic woes the good promises made from high 
rostrums hang in the air and are far from fostering the 
strengthening of faith in the possibility of perestroika he said 
the article also criticized gorbachevs political reforms under 
which a new more powerful legislature and presidency are to be 
created this year 
andreyev said the offices of communist party general secretary 
and president or head of the legislature should not be held by 
the same man as gorbachev proposes because the lawmakers are 
supposed to check his work 
andreyev also said gorbachevs policy of glasnost or 
openness on some issues has not yet been expanded to include 
criticism of the countrys leader the general secretary he said 
is still viewed as an inaccessible and exemplary figure and that 
feedback from the people he governs is essential

council said one timber company spent the weekend working in 
subzero weather to log 40 percent of the one of the areas 
wood whose group is one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit 
charged that the bureau in selling logging rights to the property 
had acted in reckless disregard for the spotted owl and was 
promoting chainsaw justice

west bank and reportedly fired guns in the air after an israeli 
settler burned to death authorities had said he died in a firebomb 
attack but today they expressed doubts 
palestinians closed shops and businesses on the second day of a 
general strike marking the beginning of the 15th month of the 
uprising against israeli occupation 
the strike came after a day of widespread violence that claimed 
the lives of up to six palestinians including two in a prison riot 
arab reports today said nidal zuhdi deeb 17 became the second 
inmate to die as a result of wounds sustained when troops opened 
fire to quell the riot at megiddo prison in northern israel on 
wednesday another prisoner died wednesday 
also wednesday settler albert gerassi 38 died when his car 
went up in flames near the west bank settlement of alfei menashe 10 
miles northeast of tel aviv news of his death caused angry 
reactions jewish settlers 
settlers from nearby ariel flocked to the main road and stoned 
arabowned cars distinguishable by blue license plates others 
hurled rocks at houses and fired guns in the air 
israel radio said several cars were damaged and a palestinian 
couple was injured when their vehicle was forced off the road into a 
ditch 
if there is no change they arabs must understand that there 
may be a jewish uprising as well said meir indor a spokesman for 
the jewish settlers council we can also throw firebombs into 
civilian cars 
but the army and police said today investigators found no glass 
fragments or other evidence of a firebomb we were looking for 
remains of a firebomb and we didnt find any and there are 
doubts said an army official 
the daily davar newspaper said the incident raised suspicions 
palestinians were using a new method of attack other newspapers 
said the fire may have been started by a short circuit 
at alfei menashe settlers held a stormy meeting wednesday night 
with the armys west bank commander maj gen amram mitzna 
you simply have to resign shouted one settler amid loud 
cheers

fifteen israelis have died in previous violence during the 
palestinian uprising which began on dec 8 1987 the palestinian 
death toll is 379 
prime minister yitzhak shamir chastized settlers for their 
actions 
this encourages them palestinians to continue and increase 
their attacks because they see their enemies getting angry and 
appearing to lose their equilibrium he said on israel army radio

a man has been convicted of murdering and 
robbing a pregnant woman who gave birth to a braindamaged girl by 
caesarean section moments before dying 
a jury deliberated less than four hours before convicting charles 
kenneth mccovey 44 of seconddegree murder and aggravated robbery 
for shooting anna holmes in front of her three children last april 
mrs holmes 31 who was eight months pregnant had gone to a 
video store with her three children to select videos for a pajama 
party 
she died moments after doctors delivered her daughter by 
caesarean section about an hour after the shooting 
the child suffered brain damage because of her mothers injuries 
a fact that was kept from the jury by 3rd district judge raymond uno 
mccovey who admitted using alcohol and amphetamines at the time 
of the crime but said he didnt intend to kill mrs holmes cried 
after the verdict 
i thought the jury would believe his version of what happened 
because it was true defense attorney andy valdez said i think 
chuck had more confidence than we did 
deputy salt lake county attorney tom vuyk who had sought a 
firstdegree mu said the 
jury has spoken and we accept their verdict 
valdez said he was relieved by the verdict and had been worried 
by publicity over the florida execution of ted bundy and a recent 
utah supreme court ruling upholding a death sentence against another 
of his clients ronnie lee gardner 
the last firstdegree homicide trial i had i lost and my 
client is on death row so this is a great relief he said 
in closing arguments vuyk said that mccovey intended to kill 
mrs holmes 
he placed a gun a 38caliber pistol to the back of her 
head and pulled the trigger that bullet entered her skull 
because he pulled the trigger vuyk said he also recounted that 
the victims then 11yearold daughmccovey say thatll take care of her 
or thats the end 
of her after her mother was shot 
valdez said mccovey had no reason to kill the woman and had 
insisted his gun discharged accidentally 
hes living his own selfimposed sentence ladies and 
gentleman he didnt intend to kill her he said 
sentencing was set for march 13 mccovey faces a maximum sentence 
of five years to life on each conviction

the new hampshire supreme court is being 
asked to decide when a burp is intentional and willful especially 
when it wrecks the results of a bloodalcohol test given to a 
suspected drunken driver 
james jordan whose two burps during a breathalyzer test in april 
cost him his license for three months maintains he didnt mean to 
belch and even tried to hold back 
breathalyzer results are skewed by burping which contaminates 
the mouth with alcohol from the stomach 
jordans lawyer james sayer argued wednesday that police 
applied a subjective standard in finding that jordan was trying to 
ruin the test results and had no right to take his license 
assistant attorney general stephen judge agreed that no criteria 
exists to determine whether belching is willful but that evidence 
supported the police 
when jordan was brought to the police station he burped police 
told him he would have to wait 20 minutes warning that any further 
burping would be considered a test refusal and result in suspension 
of his license 
jordan burped again

cambodian resistance leaders today called for the 
reconciliation of the warring factions of cambodia in a peace plan 
they said would keep the khmer rouge from returning to power 
a cambodian resistance official said he hoped the infamous khmer 
rouge leader pol pot would have no part in a future cambodian 
government 
under the proposal 2000 united nations personnel would 
supervise the withdrawal of vietnamese troops who have occupied 
cambodia since they invaded the southeast asian country in 1978 
troops from the united nations peacekeeping force also would be 
stationed in cambodia after the vietnamese left to keep the khmer 
rouge from monopolizing power prevent a civil war and protect 
cambodia from the possibility of another vietnamese invasion 
the leaders also called for establishment of a provisional 
government during the withdrawal that would include the three 
resistance factions and the vietnamesebacked government 
an army made up of 10000 men from each cambodian faction also 
would be formed any group with more than 10000 men would be forced 
to demoblize them general elections would follow 
the plan was presented by khieu samphan acting head of the khmer 
rouge and vice president of the resistance coalition prince norodom 
ranariddh son of resistance leader and former cambodian king prince 
norodom sihanouk and son soubert son of guerrilla leader son sann 
they appeared at a packed news conference in sihanouks residence in 
beijing 
sihanouk who is in beijing did not take part 
we do not want a bad peace in cambodia we do not want to be 
another lebanon said ranariddh without national 
reconciliation we have no hope in our country 
khieu samphan said the proposal differed from an earlier plan put 
forward by sihanouk in that it attempted to address vietnamese 
concerns about a return to power of the khmer rouge after vietnam 
withdraws its troops 
vietnam also rejected the earlier plan because it said the 
proposal would result in civil war in cambodia 
under the new plan those obstacles have been removed said 
khieu samphan now let us see if vietnam really has the intention 
of pursuing a political settlement 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 and toppled the 
prochinese khmer rouge who killed hundreds of thousands of people 
in a threeyear reign 
but faced with a worsening economy and pressure from its backer 
the soviet union vietnam says it will withdraw its troops from 
cambodia by september provided the four warring parties can arrive 
at a political settlement 
hanoi says 50000 troops remain in cambodia american officials 
put the number much higher 
china also has given in to soviet pressure to talk to the 
vietnamese 
last month in beijing in their first negotiations since 1979 
china and vietnam agreed that china the major backer of the 
resistance coalition would cut its aid to the guerrilla factions as 
vietnamese forces returned home 
last week the chinese and soviet foreign ministers discussed the 
cambodian conflict for the second time in two months 
they agreed that vietnams withdrawal must be supervised by an 
international agency but failed to agree on the nature of the 
supervision or on the makeup of a coalition government during the 
vietnamese withdrawal they also set may 1518 as the dates for the 
first sinosoviet summit in 30 years 
tosays proposal will be discussed during a second round of 
informal peace talks with vietnam in jakarta indonesia beginning 
feb 19 
the first round was held last summer 
ranariddh said today he opposed the return to power of pol pot 
whose measures to establish radical agrarian communism resulted in 
massive killings 
if i had to vote for mr pol pot it would of course be 
nyet he said but we feel the cambodian people should be 
allowed to decide 
he denied charges that the resistance coalition was delaying 
peace in cambodia how could we as victims be obstacles to 
peace he asked

republicans rallied today to defend defense 
secretarydesignate john tower whose confirmation vote has been 
delayed while the fbi investigates allegations about his drinking 
and his financial ties with military contractors 
for those who have known him for a very long time its very 
significant that they have never seen him incapacitated never seen 
him drunk sen pete wilson rcalif a member of the senate 
armed services committee that is considering the nomination said on 
nbcs today show 
and indeed neither have all the waiters who have been 
interviewed in response to all of the many flake allegations that 
have been thrown in over the transom wilson said 
he said he has reviewed as much of the fbi files as are 
available to date and there is nothing in there that in any way 
shakes my complete confidence that john tower is the smart tough 
secretary of defense that we need 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said of the nomination 
on abcs good morning america that i dont think its in a bit 
of trouble i think that these rumors are going to be checked out 
as they should be theyre going to be proved false and well 
confirm john tower hopefully in the next couple of weeks 
the experience of people including the chairman of that armed 
services committee have been that they have never seen john tower 
impaired because of drinking they have never seen him drunk 
they have never seen him unable to perform duty never seen him fail 
to show up for an appointment sen malcolm wallop rwyo said 
on cbs this morning 
the committee chairman sen sam nunn dga said wednesday 
following a meeting with white house counsel c boyden gray that he 
still had serious concerns that would prevent him at this point 
from voting in favor of towers nomination 
each of the charges that have been leveled against him and 
investigated subsequently have all proved groundless baseless 
wallop said 
but sen timothy wirth dcolo appearing with wallop noted 
that the white house asked that the vote be put off until the fbi 
completed its investigation 
wirth said to suggest that there are a whole lot of just silly 
accusations simply is not the information that were getting 
from the white house clearly they must believe that there is 
something in these reports or they would not have asked us to put 
off the vote 
nunn and sen john warner of virginia the ranking republican on 
the armed services committee met for two hours wednesday afternoon 
with gray to discuss the fbi investigations and then closeted 
themselves with tower for 90 minutes 
the washington post today quoted an unnamed administration source 
as saying tower presented the lawmakers with statements from his 
doctors that he does not have a disabling alcohol problem 
president bush meantime stood by his nomination of the former 
texas senator to head the pentagon 
if somebody has something other than rumor and frenzied 
speculation please get it to the fbi or get it to the white house 
staff or certainly get it to the committee in the senate but let 
us be fair enough that we do not deal in rumor after rumor bush 
said wednesday 
nunn said there are still some matters yet to be received in 
an fbi review of allegations that tower is a heavy drinker and 
womanizer 
a separate fbi review of new allegations of a financial nature 
will take another week or 10 days to complete nunn said 
adding that it has to be completed before the committee can 
proceed to a vote 
the senate begins a weeklong recess on friday meaning the 
committee could not vote before feb 21 to reject the nomination or 
send it to the full chamber 
a republican on the committee john mccain of arizona said the 
new allegations linked tower to a pentagon purchasing fraud 
investigation known as ill wind which has centered on payments 
by defense contractors for classified information on lucrative 
military contracts 
it has to do with this procurement scandal the ill wind 
thing said mccain 
at the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the 
main new allegation relates to senator towers activities while he 
was in the senate but did not elaborate 
another administration official said the fbi background inquiry 
focused on contributions to one of towers senate campaigns by a 
contractor now under investigation in the pentagon purchasing fraud 
investigation 
but the official speaking on condition of anonymity emphasized 
that the fbi had found no evidence of wrongdoing by tower and said 
politicians cant control who gives money to their campaigns 
during four days of testimony before the committee tower denied 
any financial wrongdoing but nunn and other senators have voiced 
concern whether tower could avoid conflicts of interests after 
receiving more than 1 million as a consultant for major defense 
contractors since he left the senate four years ago 
the administration had been pushing for a vote this week but 
dropped that after nunn and warner met tuesday night with bush 
nunn said he told the president frankly that i have serious 
concerns and i also stated that if a vote was held immediately as 
some have urged i would vote no because of these concerns 
the chairman said he had not polled the committee but the 
secondranking democrat on the panel sen james exon of nebraska 
said he agreed with nunn wirth too said he could not vote at this 
time to approve tower

a company sold state agencies more 
than 300000 worth of meat mixed with pet food beef lungs chicken 
necks and other illegal additives missouris attorney general 
charges in a lawsuit 
when you read through this it is frankly a modernday horror 
story william webster said of the suit seeking 800000 in 
damages from west meat co of st louis the suit was filed 
wednesday in state court 
west meat has had contracts with more than 25 state facilities 
including hospitals prisons the highway patrol academy and the 
missouri school for the blind 
webster said he had no reports of health problems related to the 
allegedly tainted meat he said the state stopped using the meat in 
october and forced west meat to pick up more than 60000 pounds 
already shipped 
between february 1986 and october 1988 the state paid west 
meat co more than 300000 for meat products we believe may well 
have been adulterated webster said 
the suit said the company added pet food spoiled meat beef 
blood suet beef lungs chicken necks kidneys adrenal and 
salivary glands and deer and chicken meat to ground beef pork 
sausage and polish sausage 
the federal government does not allow any of these elements to 
be mixed with the meat products shipped to the state webster 
said and the state contract is specific in its requirement for 
ground beef to be 80 percent lean and 20 percent fat with nothing 
added 
a lawyer for the company john kilo had no immediate comment 
today 
the suit charges the company its president joseph a west and 
a plant manager with fraud violations of merchandising laws and 
breach of contract 
were not alleging health and safety problems although im 
sure thats why the us department of agriculture has these 
standards webster said 
webster said the suit would not stop usda from taking legal 
action against the company

ronald h brown preparing to take over as 
democratic party chairman told party officials today they face 
tough adversaries and must work to define party positions more 
forcefully on issues such as defense crime and drugs 
brown who will become the first black to chair a major political 
party told the association of state democratic chairs i am going 
to be a commonsense pragmatic chairman 
he told the state party leaders weve got a difficult job 
ahead weve got tough adversaries they dont care much about 
truth or about decency 
taking over amid concern about erosion of the partys southern 
base brown said i dont want to be chairman of a party that 
writes off any region of the country 
we have to be willing to define ourselves as a party he 
said you cant possibly win if you let your adversary your 
opponent define you 
brown said that 30 and 40 years ago people could always say 
what we stood for and whom we stood with 
citing defense crime and drugs as issues of primary concern to 
voters brown said democrats have got to be willing to speak 
forcefully on those issues 
ending his fouryear term as party chairman paul g kirk jr 
told the democratic executive committee on wednesday we cant 
afford for a moment to write off the south and expect to win 
presidential elections 
we have had our clock cleaned in the south in the past several 
presidential elections he said 
pollster peter hart told the group that in the 1988 election 
republican george bush won all 155 electoral votes in the south 
against democrat michael dukakis 
you cant start out any game behind 1550 and be competitive 
hart said blaming the loss in large part on the democrats 
preference for programs over values 
kirk said he believed the south could be won by the right 
messenger with the right message 
those assessments of the partys failure to attract support in 
the south came as the democrats gathered to elect ronald h brown as 
kirks successor brown will be the first black to be chairman of a 
major political party 
he easily defeated four rivals for the post and will be unopposed 
when the democratic national committee votes on friday 
despite the ease of browns victory in the chairmanship race 
there were lingering questions about the impact his election will 
have on the party in the south 
will it help asked atlantabased pollster claibourne darden 
the answer is no what can ron brown do to help the democratic 
party bring the liberal vote to it its already there 
bring the black vote to it its already there 
merle black professor of political science at the university of 
north carolina said republicans would use browns election to put 
out the message to southern whites that the democratic party now 
is the party of blacks 
still another analyst of southern politics larry sabato of the 
university of virginia said browns election could cause problems 
for democrats in the region not so much because hes black but 
that hes tied to the twin devils ted kennedy and jesse jackson 
brown is a former aide to sen edward m kennedy of massachusetts 
and was a top adviser to jesse jackson in the closing stages of his 
1988 campaign 
hart told the democrats they also must learn to appeal to white 
protestant voters and the middle class we have to be able to talk 
to them he said 
he said white protestants make up about 48 percent of the 
electorate and that the democratic ticket lost their votes by a 21 
margin about 40 percent of the electorate are middleclass voters 
and they went republican by a margin of 55to44 hart said 
as for the south hart said it wasnt enough for the democrats 
to hold their nominating convention in atlanta and pick texas sen 
lloyd bentsen as the vice presidential nominee 
the republican ticket prevailed by running on values such as 
lawandorder and a strong defense while the democrats ran on 
programs he said 
weve got to be able to get from programs to values he said 
he also said the democrats tend to ignore what we dont do 
well and for that reason failed to make a strong case for national 
defense

heard the crash and ran to the site we tried to find someone 
alive to get them out he said but we only found dead bodies 
mayor jose humberto chaves of vila do porto said the aircraft was 
making normal maneuvers preparing to approach the airports main 
runway but should have been at 3000 feet and was much too low 
the jets pilot had not reported any trouble in a radio 
conversation with the airport three minutes before the crash the 
portuguese news agency lusa reported earlier unconfirmed reports 
said the pilot had requested a runway be cleared for an emergency 
landing

legislators freed 125 million for the 
ailing detroit symphony orchestra after it pledged to try to hire 
more black musicians 
the 100member orchestra has only one black musician even though 
its home city is twothirds black and until recently hasnt tried 
to recruit more its chairman robert s miller jr said at a 
legislative hearing wednesday 
miller said he made no specific promise to hire a black musician 
but that he hoped the orchestra would hire one before the end of the 
year 
last year the legislature appropriated 25 million to help the 
financially struggling orchestra the orchestra got half the money 
immediately but lawmakers reserved the rest until they reviewed its 
efforts to hire minorities and solve its financial problems 
on wednesday an appropriations subcommittee freed the rest of 
the money on a unanimous vote 
im convinced major change has taken place and will continue to 
take place in the orchestra said rep morris hood who sharply 
criticized the orchestras record on hiring blacks in a meeting last 
week 
miller said that the orchestra would be out of business 
without the money 
one is we cant afford to lose this money secondly if we were 
to be denied this money the reason would be we didnt live up to 
affirmative action goals he said i couldnt go to any 
corporation or individual and say please keep us in business the 
state just cut off our water because were racist 
miller said symphony executives were developing a fiveyear plan 
to take care of the money problems 
but hiring more blacks could be more difficult because there are 
relatively few black classical musicians the symphony has only 
about a halfdozen openings each year and it uses a blind audition 
in which musicians are screened from the judges when they play he 
said 
as many as 100 musicians apply for each opening in the symphony 
and only one to three are black miller said musicians earn about 
50000 a year 
this is the big leagues and every kid on the sandlot wants to 
play in the major leagues and detroit is one of those he said 
in the music world this is a highpaying glamorous job

the government today banned a 
neonazi organization and police found a cache of weapons and nazi 
propaganda including adolf hitler posters during a sweep of the 
partys headquarters 
the ban of national rallying blocks it from fielding candidates 
in next months municipal elections and comes amid a fear of a 
resurgence of rightwing extremism in west germany 
west germanys ard television network showed police carrying 
knives guns and a box filled with ammunition from the frankfurt 
home of neonazi michael kuehnen head of the party his home serves 
as the partys headquarters 
the police action had obviously caught the neonazi leaders 
completely off guard ard said noting that kuehnen was not home 
at the time of the morning raid 
the broadcast showed police in a workshop of the house where 
kuehnen and his supporters allegedly filed down bullets so they 
would cause more severe injuries 
this blow against the neonazis should be a renewed sign and an 
unmistakable warning signal interior minister friedrich 
zimmermann said in a statement he said the country is not about 
to become a roaming ground for rightwing extremists 
the organizations goals have included expulsion of foreign 
workers and people seeking asylum in the country it has about 170 
members 
zimmermann said police staged coordinated raids on apartments 
belonging to the national rallying in bavaria north rhine 
westphalia and hesse states 
bavarian officials said in a statement their searches turned up 
an air rifle two steel helmets a gas mask three pistols for 
firing blanks and nazi propaganda 
zimmermann said national rallying was banned because it damages 
with its open profession of neonaziism the reputation of the 
federal republic 
in a later statement the interior ministry said the group 
espouses revolutionary aims to change west german society and thus 
attacks the free democratic constitutional structure 
the group had registered candidates for elections in frankfurt 
and in langen and members indicated they would also seek support in 
other communities in the march voting in hesse state 
its german initials ns are identical with the bestknown 
german abbreviation for hitlers nazi party 
the nazi party has been banned since west germany was founded in 
1949 
under west german law the interior ministry may ban any 
organization which it determines is spreading nazi propaganda 
there have also been calls for the ministry to ban another 
neonazi group known as the free german workers party which the 
interior ministry says has about 500 members the free german 
workers party is under investigation in connection with arson 
attacks against foreign workers in west germany 
the interior minister accused kuehnen and his followers of 
building up neonazi groups nationwide kuehnen also has been active 
with rightwing extremists from several countries in planning 
celebrations for the 100th anniversary of hitlers birth on april 20 
under the ban national rallying cannot carry out any activities 
as a group including fielding candidates for an election the name 
national rallying is also banned from use 
violations carry criminal penalties for individuals involved 
the government in december 1983 outlawed kuehnens action front 
national socialistsnational activists group he served a 3year 
prison sentence for neonazi activities and was released in march 
1988 
national rallying was formed last summer 
in addition to kuehnens group the extreme rightwing republican 
party also has shocked many west germans with a strong showing in 
west berlin elections last month

a ymca should pay taxes because the doctors 
lawyers and others who use the facility are not legitimate subjects 
of charity a judge ruled 
allegheny county judge ralph smith jr ruled wednesday that the 
75 million downtown ymca does not meet the states legal 
definition of a charity and is not entitled to a tax exemption as a 
charitable institution 
the ruling could require it to pay more than 200000 in property 
taxes a year 
the ymca said it will appeal 
the ymca does not have to serve the poor exclusively to be 
taxexempt said bob boisture associate general counsel for the 
national ymca in washington 
its basic mission is community service that extends to all 
income levels he said if the irs found an elite upscale 
operation that would be taxed under current law and we think that 
is the right dividing line 
boisture said the pittsburgh case isnt viewed as a major 
trendsetting case around the country 
its only one case he said but he added were not going 
to lie down and play dead when we get a ruling that says a y is 
taxable were going to appeal that and also go to the legislature 
the judge cited a 1985 state supreme court case that said an 
institution is a purely public charity if it advances a 
charitable purpose donates a substantial portion of its services or 
benefits a substantial group of people who were legitimate subjects 
of charity 
organizations that relieve the government of some of its burden 
or operate free of the profit motive also can be classified as 
charities according to the law 
he seems to have ignored all of the evidence regarding the 
thousands of people annually who benefit for free from the numerous 
programs and the more than 40 organizations and thousands of 
children who use the y each year said ymca attorney richard 
wently

israel today demanded the removal of a norwegian 
un commander who compared the expulsion of nearly 80 people from 
israelicontrolled territory in south lebanon to steps nazis took in 
world war ii 
lt col je karlsen commander of the norwegian battalion in 
the un interim force in lebanon or unifil made the comparison 
last week in a private meeting with israeli officials 
he was protesting the expulsions of 79 lebanese from the israeli 
security zone which he said were carried out by israelibacked 
christian forces and lebanese working for the israeli shin bet 
security service his remark was leaked to the press and israels 
foreign ministry complained at the time 
however the ministry now wants him removed because he was quoted 
by a newspaper as saying his comparison succeeded in drawing 
attention to the expulsions a ministry spokesman said on condition 
of anonymity 
in light of the fact that the battalion commander is repeatedly 
uttering his despicable opinions israel expects the unifil command 
to draw the proper conclusions regarding the officer a foreign 
ministry statement said 
the dispute over karlsen 43 began thursday when israeli and 
un officers met to discuss the expulsions 
in world war ii my fellow countrymen sacrificed their lives in 
the struggle against the nazis who were trying to expel jews from 
norway nowadays you behave in south lebanon exactly as the nazis 
did newspapers later quoted him as saying at the meeting 
after nazi forces invaded norway in 1940 they expelled people 
from much of the north to create a military zone they burned homes 
and other buildings 
israel set up the 6to10mile deep security zone north of its 
border in 1985 when it withdrew the bulk of its forces from lebanon 
ending a threeyear occupation that followed israels 1982 invasion 
the zone is patrolled by israeli soldiers and the south lebanon 
army an israelibacked militia largely made up of lebanese 
christians most of the population of the area is shiite moslem

house speaker jim wright said today hes known 
for a month that the public wouldnt accept enactment of a 
congressional pay raise without a vote but couldnt convince his 
colleagues 
wright defended his handling of the pay raise proposal 
overwhelmingly defeated tuesday 
ive known for weeks that ultimately there would be a vote 
wright told reporters i tried to suggest there would be a 
vote ive known for four weeks that 50 percent wasnt going to 
wash 
the raise would have become law wednesday unless both houses 
voted to stop it the senate did so last week but wright had 
devised a plan to let the raise become law and schedule a vote 
today to scale it back to 30 percent along with a ban on speaking 
fees 
raise opponents however forced wright to schedule a vote 
tuesday and house members under tremendous public pressure 
rejected the increase 38048 when confronted with taking a public 
position the senate passed the same language later in the day 946 
wright told reporters today that it was already too late to 
avoid a vote when he devised his 30 percent strategy a week ago but 
he added if i had called for a vote sooner members would have 
said i gave away their pay raise 
wright also said reforms in the practice of members of congress 
accepting honoraria would not be considered anytime soon nor would 
the house take up another pay plan in the near future whether for 
judges lawmakers or the executive branch 
had the congressional pay raise debate turned out differently 
house members would most likely have been voting today to deny 
themselves honoraria as the speaking fees are known 
they may also have been deciding to limit the time members could 
spend at a conference in hawaii or elsewhere to give a single 
speech and they may well have been closing a loophole that permits 
house members in office before 1980 to convert leftover campaign 
cash to their personal use 
the reforms vanished with tuesdays vote on the pay raise 
both the house and senate were moving to restrict outside income 
if they could get a pay raise not any longer the reforms now would 
mean a loss of income and members are in no mood to take a pay cut 
i dont see us tackling it honoraria very soon said a 
house leadership aide requesting anonymity who described the 
chances for reform as somewhere between negligible and nil 
the senate in fact voted unanimously last week to ban speaking 
fees but made the action contingent on congressional salaries 
rising from 89500 to 135000 
the salaries were due to rise at 1201 am wednesday if both 
houses had not stopped it and the senate honoraria ban would have 
kicked in at the same time 
in the house bipartisan negotiators had fashioned a package that 
included the honoraria ban the travel restrictions ending the 
campaign cash loophole and other outside income restrictions 
house speaker jim wright had devised a strategy to let the 51 
percent raise become law wednesday and have the house vote today on 
scaling it back to 30 percent while also voting on the outside 
income package the plan collapsed under relentless public pressure 
against the raise 
common cause the selfstyled citizens lobby will continue to 
fight the honoraria system said its president fred wertheimer the 
group supported the defeated pay raise plan along with an honoraria 
ban 
our view is this is not legitimate money he said the 
system is corrupt and unacceptable we will press to end the system 
its going to be a fight i cant tell you how long its going to 
take i do not think the system will survive in the long term 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan perhaps predicted the 
future when he said this week no one has raised his hand for a 
pay cut so i hope we can go on as we have been 
dole was the senates honoraria champion in 1987 with 106050 
in speaking fees more than any other senator that year he gave 
80000 of the amount to charity 
the senate allows its members to retain 35800 a year in 
honoraria and the house permits retention of 26850 that earning 
capacity would be lost if the system was ended without a 
corresponding pay raise 
although senators unanimously voted last week to ban honoraria if 
the pay raise had become law many house members suspect senators 
like the system that gives them 9000 more in compensation than the 
house 
a lot of people want to see what happens in the senate before 
tackling honoraria in the house rep patricia schroeder dcolo 
said wednesday

congressmen from new mexico and idaho 
introduced legislation today to pave the way for the opening of the 
nations first permanent nuclear waste repository 
the bill sponsored by reps joe skeen rnm and richard 
stallings didaho also was designed in part to avert the forced 
shutdown of a plutonium processing plant in colorado that is a vital 
link in the nationwide nuclear weapons complex 
the legislation would authorize the transfer of more than 10000 
acres of federal lands in southern new mexico to the jurisdiction to 
the department of energy it also authorizes payments of 250 
million to new mexico for costs related to building the waste 
isolation pilot plant 
the repository is being mined from salt beds deep beneath the new 
mexico desert and was to open last october it developed water 
leaks and the energy department has not set a new date for opening 
the site 
the delay in opening the repository has caused a major problem 
for the states of idaho and colorado idaho gov cecil andrus late 
last year barred the shipment of wastes from colorados rocky flats 
plutonium processing plant to temporary disposal sites in his state 
colorado in turn has said it will close the rocky flats plant 
in may unless a new waste storage site is found for the contaminated 
materials that are building up at rocky flats just outside denver 
andrus has said he would reconsider his barring of waste 
shipments to idaho if legislation were introduced to speed the 
opening of the new mexico repository 
this was the last piece of the puzzle said stallings he 
added however that he was not sure andrus was ready to reconsider 
the ban

volkswagen of america inc must pay 114000 
to a woman injured in a crash that a jury blamed on the gas pedal 
and brake being too close together a state appeals court has ruled 
a threejudge panel wednesday reinstated a verdict in favor of 
germaine gibbs of elizabeth 
she was injured along with her three children when an audi 5000 
smashed through their apartment in 1983 the cars driver harold 
horowitz of elizabeth told police the automobile lunged forward 
suddenly 
ms gibbs attorney james hely contended that audi knew the 
accelerator and brake pedal had been put too close together and 
sometimes caused drivers to step on both simultaneously prompting 
the car to lunge forward 
a superior court jury in march ordered volkswagen to pay ms 
gibbs 100000 in punitive damages and 14000 in compensatory 
damages 
the judge set aside the punitive damages finding there was no 
proof volkswagen knew the car had problems and failed to correct 
them 
but the appellate court reinstated the full amount 
while the evidence to support punitive damages was not 
overwhelming we are satisfied that a jury could reasonably have 
concluded that volkswagen was guilty of deliberate acts of omissions 
with knowledge of a high degree of probability of harm or reckless 
indifference to the consequences the court said 
john bennett a spokesman for volkswagen in troy mich said the 
company may seek another appellate hearing 
in 1983 volkswagen told the national highway traffic safety 
administration that it would take corrective measures to prevent 
inadvertent activation of brake and gas pedals at the same time 
according to court papers filed by hely 
internal volkswagen documents and a government report conclude 
that the pedals were close enough that the accelerator often is 
pushed when the driver tries to brake hely said the documents show 
volkswagen knew about the problem as early as 1979 
volkswagen declined to comment about the internal documents filed 
by hely 
the center for auto safety a washingtonbased consumer group 
has charged that more than 1650 accidents have resulted from audi 
5000s that inexplicably surged forward more than 400 people have 
been injured and five killed in those accidents 
audi has had poor sales since the unintended acceleration charges 
arose us sales were 60000 cars in 1986 41000 in 1987 and 
23000 in 1988 said david healy an auto industry analyst for 
drexel burnham lambert

a geothermal field on the southern island of kyushu 
could produce 250 megawatts of electricity and become the largest in 
japan a construction company said thursday 
fujita corp said one well that it drilled a year ago in oita on 
kyushu had been proved to be the largest producer of steam and hot 
water in the world issuing 120 tons of steam and 100 tons of hot 
water an hour enough to produce 20 megawatts of electricity 
spokesman hitoshi miyagishima said fujita was digging several 
more wells in the geothermal field and had a plan to build 30 wells 
to produce 250 megawatts of electricity with an investment of 12 
billion 
but he said fujita had not approached the local utility about 
building the plant nor had it asked the national government for 
financial aid 
if the field is fully developed it would more than double the 
current national total of 215 megawatts of electricity from 
geothermal sources fujita said press reports said japan still 
would trail the united states because one field there has a 
generating capacity of 1900 megawatts 
japan despite its many volcanos and hot springs has not devoted 
much effort to exploring geothermal energy until recently its main 
drive has been into nuclear reactors which supplied 29 percent of 
the countrys electricity in 1987 the government has approved a 
plan to double the output of nuclear power plants by the year 2000 
a nuclear reactor usually produces more than 1000 megawatts of 
electricity or more than four times the output of the projected 
geothermal field in kyushu

a man who grew up thinking that his mother had died 
in a farmhouse fire was reunited with her after learning that she 
had spent 64 years in a sanitorium 
this has been unexplainable joy paul daniluk said god has 
permitted me to know and be able to express my love to my mother 
daniluk 68 of denver was 4 in 1925 when he and his father 
survived the fire in upstate new york he grew up thinking his 
mother agnes died in the blaze but she had actually been 
diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia and put in a county 
sanitorium 
she apparently suffered severe trauma during the fire and her 
husband was ashamed to admit her condition or whereabouts to others 
according to the family 
anton daniluk remarried in 1948 and he and his second wife died 
in 1976 
when he was dying my sister spent time with him and he would 
say something about agnes and the fire she couldnt tell exactly 
what he was saying but now she knows said richard daniluk 
pauls son 
daniluk mentioned to his daughter tanya his memories of the 
fire and his mother in one scene he was sitting with his father on 
a bench in a redbrick building with white wood trim and shiny 
floors while in the background a woman swept the floor 
dad said the building reminded him of a hospital or 
institution tanya recalled in a story in thursdays denver post 
so trying to track down details on her grandmother she began 
calling new york hospitals starting with albany she asked the 
information operator if she knew of a hospital in a redbrick 
building with white trim 
the operator gave her the number of binghamton psychiatric 
center they called three days after christmas 
my brother and i were talking and i asked him what if shes 
still alive she said he said that was impossible because she 
would have had to have been more than 100 well he was close we 
dialed the number and asked if they had a patient named agnes 
daniluk and the receptionist said just a minute ill ring that 
floor 
they reached a supervisor and explained who they were and who 
they were looking for 
we all broke out in tears tanya said god just led us to 
her 
mrs daniluk it seems had been led to believe her son had died 
in the fire hospital officials warned the family not to expect too 
much from the woman now 95 
she had become violent during her hospitalization and in 1955 was 
given a prefrontal lobotomy an operation used at the time for 
certain treatments but after a recent visit they were left with no 
doubts 
when she was happy shed clap her hands to the tune of a 
polka theres no doubt she knows tanya said 
she may not know were her grandchildren but she knows its 
family richard said 
agnes a ward of the state since 1925 is too fragile to be moved 
to denver and will remain at the hospital the family said 
she is well taken care of richard said the people there 
are really her family they care for her as if she were their own

a delegate to parliamentary talks with 
north korea on thursday urged the communist nation to retract its 
decision to call off a meeting between the two nations because of 
joint ussouth korean military exercises 
along with all people who yearn for fruitful results of the 
dialogue we feel very much regretful about the north korean 
decision said rep chae munshick a former national assembly 
speaker 
he called on north korea to continue the talks in the interest 
of national harmony and unification 
chae heads a south korean delegation to parliamentary talks with 
north korea the talks cover a nonaggression pact and other 
measures aimed at easing tension between the nations 
delegations of lawmakers from both sides have met seven times to 
prepare for a joint meeting of their full legislatures another 
round of talks was to be held friday 
north korea announced wednesday that the friday meeting must be 
postponed until after the joint team spirit training exercises 
are over 
chae said the joint exercises are defensive and have been 
conducted annually since 1976 
in fact our side has informed north korea in advance of the 
exercises and even invited them to observe the open and defensive 
nature of the training he said 
he said north korea also conducts joint military exercises with 
the soviet union 
chae noted the north korean radio broacast came only 30 minutes 
after the breakdown of another set of talks between the nations 
aimed at preparing the first meeting of their prime ministers 
this all gives me the impression that they had a preplanned 
scenario to embarrass our side and dump responsibility on us he 
said 
the military exercises have been conducted in various parts of 
south korea since 1976 to train the joint command system of the two 
countries in the event of an invasion north korea invaded south 
korea in 1950 starting a threeyear war 
this years team spirit exercises began last week with about 
200000 troops taking part the maneuvers usually last about two 
months 
wednesdays talks bogged down over north koreas insistence the 
exercises be halted the two sides are scheduled to meet again march

the spokesman who demanded anonymity said another person was 
stabbed and five were wounded by gunshots in separate incidents 
today 
williams killer fled said the spokesman who did not give any 
of the victims party affiliations 
shortly before the polls opened at 7 am a man was shot at a 
kingston polling station the police spokesman said he was shot in 
the chest and was in serious condition 
the independent rjr radio station identified the man as keith 
kettle and said he was shot in the backside by a 357caliber magnum 
revolver wielded by one of eight seaga supporters who converged on 
the polling station 
rjr began its 7 am newscast with a prayer from the rev c 
everett bailey who reminded listeners it was the beginning of lent 
and said let no one of us be guilty before god of aiding or 
abetting any violence 
twelve people have been killed and scores wounded since the 
campaign opened jan 15 
manley who since the 1970s has moved toward the political 
center was rated a 14point favorite 57 percent of the vote to 43 
percent in the last opinion poll sunday 
seaga was seeking a third consecutive term something no jamaican 
government has achieved since universal suffrage in 1944 
pollster carl stone of the university of the west indies said 
manleys peoples national party would probably capture 48 of the 60 
seats in parliament the pollster has correctly predicted the winner 
of every jamaican election since 1972 
today is jamaicas first nationally contested election since 1980 
manley boycotted the last election in 1983 in a dispute over 
voter registration lists giving seagas centerright jamaica labor 
party all 60 parliamentary seats 
there were allegations of voting irregularities on both sides 
manley said he witnessed verbal harassment of supporters at 
one station during a morning tour of polling places that station 
also lacked the red ink voters are supposed to dip their fingers in 
to prevent double voting he said 
they were just openly breaking the law creating an atmosphere 
of hostility manley said but he added the irregularities were 
not widespread just the odd incident so far but one is 
monitoring the thing 
sen george ramacon of seagas party accused manleys party of 
ballot stuffing in at least one constituency 
military helicopters flew over the capital of 1 million on 
election eve as part of a nationwide security operation involving 
10000 soldiers and police 
violence has been confined mainly to kingstons slums where 
heavily armed gangs have traditionally controlled large voting 
blocs and rural areas far from the big tourist hotels on the north 
coast 
seaga and manley signed a peace accord in august in an attempt to 
prevent violence but throughout the campaign they accused each 
other of breaching it 
the charismatic manley 64 educated at the london school of 
economics was prime minister from 1972 to 1980 he has projected a 
moderate prous image in contrast to his previous farleft 
leadership 
manley said he would restore relations with neighboring communist 
cuba during his first year in office but only on a restricted and 
formal basis seaga broke relations with cuba upon taking office in 
1980 
seaga 58 who was born in boston and educated at harvard has 
been one of the united states closest allies in the caribbean 
he has helped restore jamaicas battered economy but higher 
taxes and devaluation of the jamaican dollar have cut deeply into 
the purchasing power of most wage earners and the standard of living 
of jamaicas 24 million people has continued to fall

children mostly from asia and central america has been charged 
with sexual abuse amid indications of wanton sexual activity at 
his home a prosecutor said 
a 12yearold blind girl from guatemala told investigators she 
was molested repeatedly by theadore e ripley 46 his adopted son 
kori ripley 30 a former reserve sheriffs deputy and at least one 
juvenile in the home according to documents filed in clallam county 
superior court 
police are also investigating claims of sexual abuse by several 
children in the ripley household which once was praised in a 
nationwide broadcast by author and minister norman vincent peale 
the documents said 
in the documents county prosecutor david h bruneau wrote that 
such disclosures by multiple victims and multiple abusers show a 
pattern of wanton sexual activity within that residence and 
certainly tend to corroborate the continuing disclosures by the 
victim of the sexual abuse of her 
the elder ripley will plead innocent when he is arraigned friday 
on a charge of seconddegree statutory rape said his attorney 
david johnson the charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in 
prison and a 20000 fine 
ted adamantly denies the charges were hoping for a speedy 
resolution of the case and were confident that ultimately the truth 
will come out johnson said 
ripley remained free on personal recognizance but was barred by 
court order from trying to visit the girl

protective services office said the girl had been declared a ward 
of the state and placed in a foster home but three minor children 
remain with the ripleys

in the latest case and is not mentioned in any of the associated 
court papers 
in july a juvenile boy living in the ripley home was convited of 
assaulting the same girl and was sentenced to 22 weeks in a juvenile 
institution it was that case that led to the charges against kori 
and theadore ripley bruneau said 
peale praised the ripleys in a nationwide broadcast for adopting 
children from other countries and bringing them to the united 
states according to newspaper accounts which said there were 18 
children in the household in february 1980

sales by americans to 12 west european 
countries will reach the level of imports by the end of this year if 
present trends continue a commerce department official said 
thursday 
thats not a prediction its a projection franklin j 
vargo deputy assistant secretary for europe told reporters 
he told the house small business committee that us exports to 
the european economic community rose more than 25 percent last year 
while us imports rose 5 percent changes which cut the us trade 
deficit with the community to 13 billion from 24 billion in 1987 
another year of those trends and the deficit will disappear he 
said 
he pointed out that us companies and their affiliates sold more 
than 600 billion worth of goods to the 12 countries last year 
three times as much as to canada and four times as much as to japan 
for many years after world war ii us exports to western europe 
exceeded imports in recent years that trend has reversed 
the 12 countries in the community are britain west germany 
france italy denmark ireland belgium holland luxembourg 
spain portugal and greece they are now trying to turn their 
association into a single market almost as integrated as the united 
states by the end of 1992 some americans see that movement as a 
threat of a fortress europe which would keep out american goods 
on balance 1992 should benefit the united states vargo told 
the committee 
he said faster growth should furnish a better market for us 
goods but he said there are many problems remaining especially in 
the common standards being set by the 12 governments for imported 
products and the possibility that tests of us products to see that 
they meet those standards will be required on european soil 
frank s swain the small business administrations chief counsel 
for advocacy urged american companies to set up a subsidiary in one 
of the 12 countries 
the consensus is that the eec single internal market will 
materialize if not by 1992 then shortly thereafter he said in 
testimony for the committee 
establishing a subsidiary in the eec would be the safest 
option although it also could be the costliest choice initially 
he said

a new class of communist party and government 
bureaucrats is sabotaging president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms 
and the soviet leadership is unable to combat it a daring magazine 
article says 
direct criticism of gorbachevs reform program has remained 
largely off limits despite his policy of greater openness in 
society but sergei y andreyevs article in the leningrad monthly 
neva is one of the harshest and most detailed attacks yet on the 
communist system and gorbachevs policies 
the party general secretary the post gorbachev holds along with 
the presidency remains an inaccessible and exemplary figure 
and his attempt to make the system democratic still leaves the 
people politically powerless andreyev wrote 
all decisions of the upper powers are carried out only to the 
extent that they are advantageous to the new class andreyev said 
in the 28page essay in the january issue of the literary and 
political magazine 
he said the new class is a production and managerial 
apparatus of 14 million party bureaucrats government ministers 
and managers 
gorbachev himself has launched a war on bureaucrats who interfere 
in daytoday decisions about production and has tried to transfer 
some of their power to local officials and factory managers he 
often blames bureaucrats for the slow pace of reform 
but andreyev said gorbachev hasnt gone far enough and that the 
new class controls the government and party 
both the soviet government and party organs have turned out 
to be subordinate to its interests he said adding that the model 
government of the people has been replaced by the dictate of the 
new class 
andreyev 34 is a biologist and plant director who said he 
represents a new political club called alternative he mocks the 
partys claim of popular support and uses gensec in referring to 
the general secretary the abbreviation may be used in colloquial 
speech but isnt seen in the staterun press 
andreyevs use of the term new class appeared to be a 
reference to milovan djilas book the new class which 
criticized the communist system the yugoslav politican and writer 
who broke with yugoslavias leadership said in the 1957 book that 
the communist system had produced a new class of privileged leaders 
instead of a classless society 
the new class andreyev wrote is largely responsible for the 
lack of major improvements in the soviet economy and for impediments 
to democracy that have arisen since gorbachev came to power in march 
1985 and the next month launched his program of reforms known as 
perestroika 
we must admit that the economy is in a crisis for the 
years since the memorable april plenum of the communist party 
central committee the economy didnt get on track the crisis 
in this way is deepening andreyev said 
he said politicians no longer tell the producers what to do but 
that new class uses party bodies to give orders to the society 
perestroika is moving slowly not because of some mysterious 
forces but because of wellorganized sabotage he wrote 
some soviets have written letters to the editor claiming factory 
managers and others are sabotaging gorbachevs reforms by 
withholding food and consumer goods from store shelves 
the 57yearold kremlin chief has admitted perestroika is not 
moving as quickly as he had hoped but reaffirmed his commitment to 
reform and said the people support his program 
andreyev however said the current leadership is partly to blame 
for economic woes because it hasnt kept its promise to let 
unprofitable businesses go bankrupt 
the good promises made from high rostrums hang in the air and 
are far from fostering the strengthening of faith in the possibility 
of perestroika he said 
the article also criticized gorbachevs political overhaul under 
which a new more powerful legislature and presidency are to be 
created this year andreyev said the offices of communist party 
general secretary and president or head of the legislature 
should not be held by the same man as gorbachev proposes because 
the lawmakers are supposed to check the work of the top political 
figure 
despite the partys claim that it serves the people and is in the 
vanguard of society the general population practically never 
had access to the real levers of power and doesnt have it now 
either he said 
on the world scene the soviet brand of socialism has a 
demoralizing influence and is perceived as capable of leading 
only to collapse he said

rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the 
house ways and means committee on thursday promised allout 
opposition to president bushs proposal to reduce the tax on capital 
gains 
im not about to tell the wage earners in chicago that they 
should pay a higher tax than stockbrokers rostenkowski said in a 
speech to the national press club 
i personally will strongly resist any efforts to undo the 
1986 tax reform including the return to a preferential tax rate 
for capital gains rostenkowski said 
he spoke eight hours before bush was delivering a package of 
budget recommendations that was expected to include a call for lower 
taxes on capital gains which are profits from the sale of stocks 
real estate and other assets 
there is strong support in congress principally among 
republicans but even among some democratic liberals for taxing 
capital gains at a lower rate than applies to wages and other 
income capital gains and most other income now are taxed at rates 
of either 15 percent 28 percent or 33 percent 
seventy percent of capital gains are taken by people with incomes 
above 100000 a year 
rostenkowski has emphasized on other occasions that restoring a 
preference for capital gains would threaten the landmark 1986 tax 
overhaul which was characterized by a significant cut in tax rates 
for most americans and a reduction or elimination of several 
deductions and credits 
rostenkowski sounded another familiar theme at the press club 
despite bushs campaign pledges any realistic plan for reducing the 
budget deficit must include tax increases he said 
if president bush is willing to put all spending and revenues 
on the table he will find a congress willing to make the tough 
choices that real deficit reduction requires he said 
the veteran lawmaker said that thenpresident reagan had also 
made a notax pledge but that during his eight years in office 
reagan raised more taxes than any peacetime president reagan 
signed more than a dozen tax increases 
rostenkowski said the 1990 budget left by reagan was based on 
highly optimistic projections on how the economy will perform 
does anyone really believe that real growth will be 32 percent 
this year or inflation at 38 percent or shortterm interest rates 
at 63 percent rostenkowski asked those are the numbers in the 
last reagan budget 
i hope i dont see them in president bushs budget he said 
i dont want to raise taxes but i wont participate in a sham

a council summoned by afghan 
guerrillas meets friday charged with choosing a government to 
replace the marxist regime and the main question is whether 
moderates or islamic fundamentalists will prevail 
the 526 delegates to the council called a shura include moslem 
guerrillas who have fought the afghan and soviet armies for a 
decade ministers who served the former monarchy scholars and other 
exiles 
they are scheduled to meet for three days at a religious complex 
on the outskirts of islamabad guerrillas with assault rifles 
patrolled the grounds thursday and all cars were examined at the 
gate 
insurgent leaders organized the council and gave it the specific 
task of choosing an administration to oversee elections in 
guerrillacontrolled areas of afghanistan and in the refugee camps 
pakistan and iran 
more than 5 million afghans about onethird of the population 
have fled to the two neighboring countries since the civil war began 
after a communist coup in april 1978 most went to pakistan 
azim nasserzia a spokesman for the moderate national islamic 
front of afghanistan said he feared fundamentalists among the seven 
major insurgent parties based in pakistan would would resurrect an 
earlier guerrilla government they had controlled 
we dont want an extremistdominated government because 
they wont do anything about an election he said we will 
boycott it if they insist on the revival of the ahmed shah 
government 
ahmed shah a leader of one of the fundamentalist parties was to 
have been president of a provisional regime the guerrillas chose a 
year ago but it never became functional 
nasserzias party supports elections which would be held over 
six months and choose a parliament of 350 members millions of 
ballots have been printed 
the political strategy assumes the government in kabul will fall 
soon after the soviet military withdrawal is completed next week 
red army soldiers entered afghanistan in december 1979 to help 
fight the moslem insurgency and an estimated 115000 were in the 
country when the withdrawal began may 15 under a unmediated 
agreement it is to be completed by feb 15 
political leaders of the groups based in pakistan and iran where 
the guerrilla alliance has eight parties still were discussing a 
formula for representation on the eve of the shura 
those based in iran predominantly shiite moslems like their host 
country were dissatisfied with 60 seats originally allotted by the 
sunni moslems based in pakistan who claimed 420 the other 46 
places on the shura are reserved for afghan exiles and good 
moslems who have stayed at home 
afghanistan is more than 80 percent sunni moslem and about 17 
percent shiite 
qaribur rehman saeed a spokesman for the pakistanbased 
alliance said thursday the coalition in iran would be assigned 80 
seats but he could not predict how many would demand places at the 
council 
we have problems big problems saeed told reporters at the 
meeting site 
years of quarreling among rebel groups made many afghans 
skeptical that the the leaders can put their differences aside and 
reach consensus 
witnesses said a rally of about 3000 moderates in peshawar the 
pakistani frontier city where the sevenparty alliance is based 
ended violently wednesday when fundamentalists threw bricks into the 
crowd and attacked the stage area 
the rally was organized by afghans who favor the return of former 
king zahir shah who was deposed in 1973 and lives in italy 
whatever government the shura chooses the real power will be 
held by a supreme council of guerrilla leaders and their appointees 
spokesman for the pakistanbased parties said 
the groups based in iran have not yet been included in that 
council and since doing so would increase the fundamentalist 
influence this is a gamble for us and for everyone else 
said the moderate nasserzia

afghanistans military chiefs on 
thursday ordered the evacuation of five villages north of the 
capital in preparation for an offensive against moslem guerrillas 
trying to topple the government 
the countrys top general mohammad assef delawar said 
authorities planned to move residents from the villages of 
shakadara karabargh kalakan bagram and mirbachakot 
delawar said the evacuation had not yet begun he gave no 
schedule and did not say how many people would be affected 
the villages are about 45 miles north of kabul along a stretch of 
the salang highway the route departing soviet soldiers are using to 
return home before their feb 15 withdrawal deadline 
we are evacuating for security reasons not to harm them 
delawar said these people the guerrillas are highway robbers 
and plunderers if the people are not able to move them out the 
armed forces will help them we will defend them 
heavy shelling and bombings have been heard in the area in the 
past week 
in moscow soviet tv said thursday night that soviet convoys on 
the salang highway heading home have been shelled only once and one 
soviet soldier was killed no date was given for the attack earlier 
in the day however foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov 
said rebels have not interfered with the withdrawal of soviet 
troops 
most of delawars 20minute news conference was spent on 
political rather than military issues 
he and other afghan military officers refused to disclose the 
strength of the armed forces although foreign diplomats have 
estimated the number at about 140000 
asked about the ability of the armed forces to defend the country 
after the soviets leave the general said the army is mighty 
enough to defend the cause of peace and the people we have enough 
people and adequate weapons and our army is qualified to defend the 
country 
delawar refused comment on the morale of his troops 
there have been reports some soldiers posted along the salang 
highway have defected and that two helicopter crews defected 
wednesday in pakistan 
concerns about the afghan armys ability to defend the capital 
prompted western nations to pull out their diplomats some diplomats 
have predicted kabul will collapse within months after the soviets 
are gone 
this is not the first time the opposition has claimed they will 
conquer kabul we want to make it clear that the government will 
survive no one can conquer kabul delawar said 
earlier this week the government said weapons had been handed 
out to 30000 members of the ruling peoples democratic party of 
afghanistan to help them defend their homes and neighborhoods 
the soviets entered afghanistan in december 1979 to back the 
government in its war with moslem guerrillas under a unmediated 
accord signed last year they are to have all their troops out by 
feb 15

the american bar association has adopted a plan to 
overhaul the nations guardianship system for the elderly by 
tightening judicial procedures requiring more accountability and 
educating judges and guardians 
the abas house of delegates on a voice vote tuesday approved 
the reforms drafted by guardianship experts last summer in response 
to an associated press series said nancy coleman director of the 
abas commission on legal problems of the elderly 
the ap report guardianship of the elderly an ailing system 
found widespread abuse through guardianship the courtadministrated 
system designed to protect the elderly 
ms coleman said that the aba policy will be used to help states 
draft guardianship reforms as well as generate education 
requirements for judges and those who serve as guardians of the 
elderly by itself it will not change guardianship laws 
people looking to make changes can use what is now aba policy 
as a platform for measuring change she said in daily practice 
lawyers and judges could use it as a basis for making changes in 
their courts 
the house of delegates the policymaking body for the nations 
largest lawyers organization recommended a broad range of changes 
from new court procedures to stricter standards for judges 
attorneys and guardians the package also encouraged the legal 
system to rely more on alternatives to guardianship when appropriate 
under guardianship old people determined to be incompetent by a 
court can lose most of their rights such as deciding where they 
will live how theyll spend their money and what kind of medical 
care theyll receive 
the aba delegates called for reforms to make the guardianship 
process more understandable to the elderly including easytoread 
court petitions and better training for court officers 
the package also called for stricter criteria for placing people 
under guardianship and closer scrutiny of the wards and their 
finances once they are placed under guardianship 
the original proposal had included mandatory legal representation 
for those facing guardianship and a set of rules for attorneys 
representing guardians and those facing guardianship those sections 
were dropped at the urging of members of the bars section on real 
property probate and trust who called for further study 
the recommendation came out of a national conference on 
guardianship last july called in response to the 1987 ap 
investigation which looked at the guardianship system in all 50 
states and found that many old people are placed under guardianship 
without legal counsel often without a day in court 
once the elderly are placed under guardianship the courts often 
lost track of them leaving the wards and their money prey to abuse 
ap reporters found many instances of money misspent and the elderly 
mistreated 
the series received the bar associations silver gavel award in 
1988

a wild golden eagle that had clung to 
life for more than a week after being shot with buckshot died 
thursday a veterinarian said 
he was a very magnificent animal and its just a shame said 
dr loran wagoner a partner at the skyline animal clinic who had 
performed emergency surgery on the bird tuesday words just cant 
express how you feel when you put all the effort into it and they 
die 
the eagle a 10pound adult male with a 6foot wingspan was 
discovered tuesday by state highway department workers near sharon 
grove in southern kentucky wagoner said it apparently had been shot 
about a week earlier and was suffering from malnutrition 
he and three other veterinarians installed intramedullary pins to 
hold the eagles broken bones together and were trying to restore 
the enfeebled birds strength sufficiently to transfer it to the 
louisville zoo for full recovery 
the surgery went very successfully and the bird fully 
recovered from the anesthetic wagoner said in fact during the 
day yesterday the bird continually got stronger by yesterday 
afternoon he was occasionally striking at the hand of the person 
that was feeding him 
however wagoner said when he came to feed the bird about 930 
pm wednesday night i noticed what seemed to be neurological 
signs developing i called the veterinarian at the louisville zoo 
and he wasnt sure if this was the case it was just a waitandsee 
type of thing 
the bird died a few hours later 
shooting a golden eagle or a bald eagle carries a federal penalty 
of up to a 100000 fine or one year in prison the state department 
of fish and wildlife has asked for the publics help in identifying 
the shooter

a former state highway official agreed to 
testify against others and then changed his plea thursday to guilty 
to federal charges of extortion and filing false income tax returns 
prosecutors said 
sam waggoner resigned in december as one of the three members of 
the highway commission in the face of the impending charges 
assistant us attorney ruth harris told us district judge tom 
s lee that waggoner had helped in the investigation of other 
unspecified cases and his continued cooperation will include 
testimony before grand juries and at trials 
lee said waggoners sentencing would be scheduled later on the 
extortion charge involving his acceptance of approximately 127000 
in cash from a construction company and three counts of filing false 
tax returns for 198486 during which the irs says he underreported 
his income by 190500 
waggoner who was a highway commissioner for 21 years remains 
free on a 5000 personal recognizance bond he also posted a 
205000 bond to cover back taxes interest and penalties 
harris recommended waggoner 67 be sentenced to two years on the 
extortion charge and placed on five years probation on the income 
tax charges as well as a 40000 fine waggoner must pay all back 
taxes plus interest and penalties 
she said the extortion charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 
years in jail and a 250000 fine filing false income tax returns 
carries a threeyear jail term and a 100000 fine for each count 
waggoner announced his dec 31 resignation in a dec 21 statement 
which said i am resigning because i have made a mistake and i 
must now pay the price for that mistake 
on wednesday lee sentenced a second highway commisioner bob 
joiner 59 to a sixyear prison term on a federal extortion charge 
he also received a fiveyear suspended sentence and was ordered to 
pay a 100000 fine on a tax evasion charge 
the three members of the highway commission are elected only from 
the district which they represent and act autonomously in matters 
concerning road construction and maintenance within their district 
there has been considerable public discussion about changing the 
system to make the commission a statewide board but so far the 
legislature has taken no action to change the system 
in the meantime special elections have been held to replace 
waggoner and joiner

the owner of a private factory was forced to give 
his business to the state after peasants wanting part of his 
profits attacked the plant and officials jealous of his success 
sued him a newspaper said thursday 
the report in the official china youth news illuminated some of 
the problems faced by individual firms in china which has been 
experimenting with private enterprise the last few years 
some businessmen have incurred the peoples wrath because they 
fire people as they attempt to break the iron rice bowl chinas 
tradition of lifetime employment others have been attacked because 
local residents are jealous of their success 
the story of ren jianfa falls into the second category 
in 1982 ren scrimped and borrowed about 9500 to open an 
ironworks factory in jiangyin a small city in the eastern province 
of jiangsu 
after two years ren had repaid his debts set down some roots 
and even cleared a profit the story said but as the sound of 
the hammer brought profits so it also brought troubles 
first a representative of local government called on him saying 
he had to start sharing his profits because his factory was on 
public land ren had already agreed to pay the electrical water and 
electric plowing fees of 100 households 
but this little problem was just a sign of things to come 
the article said 
one day a fisherman couldnt catch anything in a river near the 
factory 
he alleged the hammers of ren jianfas factory had scared away 
his fish the paper said 
the man gathered about 60 of his friends and they attacked the 
factory smashing its windows cutting its power supply and blocking 
its docks production stopped 
even though ren had thousands of dollars he couldnt get any 
help because his factory was privately owned the paper said 
so ren jianfa took one step back in order to go two steps forward 
and gave the factory to the staterun production team 
in so doing ren united his interests with those of a collective 
ren signed a contract with the production team changed from 
boss to factory manager and under the umbrella of a staterun 
business looked forward to the future 
soon government officials from wuxi a nearby city came to the 
factory saying they had received a tip they wanted to see his 
books it appeared another government agency also wanted a piece 
of rens profits 
this fellow gave his factory to the production team but didnt 
give it to us the newspaper quoted officials in the other agency 
as saying weve got to send this guy to jail 
within days 100 people had signed on to sue ren 
but in court there was nothing but silence the report said 
what crimes did ren commit nobody really knew 
the only crime was that ren had gotten rich 
the suit was dropped but the marathon struggle over interests had 
kept the factory silent six months 
in summing up the story said ren jianfa was no lei feng a 
chinese military hero known for his selflessness 
but it said he understands that if you want to succeed 
here you have to have dauntless strength

the judge at oliver norths irancontra trial 
today sent the jury home until next week after the justice 
department succeeded in temporarily bringing the case to a halt 
the us circuit court of appeals issued an administrative stay 
halting all proceedings after the justice department acting on 
behalf of us intelligence agencies said more stringent controls 
are needed over classified material north intends to present in his 
defense 
us district judge gerhard a gesell said he would close up 
shop because a threemember panel of the appeals court issued the 
stay and has given him no indication when it will rule further on 
the matter 
gesell said the appeals court has asked me not to go forward 
until they have had a chance to look at the papers filed in the 
case 
the threejudge panel said the administrative stay was to 
permit the court sufficient opportunity to consider the pending 
motion 
the judge said he would reconvene monday morning to assess the 
situation 
it is imperative that the trial be suspended pending the 
outcome of the pending appeal said the justice departments 
motion for a stay 
the department said it was making the motion because of the 
national security equities involved and the highly sensitive 
classified information that may be compromised if this case is 
permitted to proceed to trial without correction of the procedures 
that the district court proposes to employ 
minutes after the jury of nine woman and three men all of them 
black was chosen gesell declared his intention to permit the 
prosecution to begin opening arguments 
after a brief recess gesell returned and disclosed the appeals 
courts action shortly after the jury and six alternates were chosen 
the panel of chief judge patricia wald and circuit judges douglas 
h ginsburg and david sentelle said in a brief order that the stay 
should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of 
the justice departments request 
earlier gesell had denied a motion by the justice department for 
a stay of the trial pending the outcome of its appeal seeking to 
have more stringent controls on classified material that north plans 
to present in his defense 
in denying the motion gesell said the attorney generals 
belated general appearance is wholly misplaced the attorney 
generals attempt to appeal is at odds with the purposes of the 
laws establishing the independent counsel who is prosecuting the 
case 
ron noble a justice department deputy to criminal division chief 
ed dennis immediately went to the us court of appeals in an 
attempt to get the trial stopped 
gesell said he would check with the appeals court and ask 
whether any instructions await me 
at issue is whether national security will be threatened by 
disclosure of classified information during norths trial on charges 
of shredding evidence and lying to congress in an attempt to cover 
up the irancontra affair 
the justice department stepped into the case wednesday by 
demanding censorship control over classified documents that the 
defense wants to enter as evidence that position was also opposed 
by independent counsel lawrence walsh who is prosecuting north a 
former white house national security aide 
the judge called the departments intervention in the case one 
of the most frivolous motions i have ever seen 
gesell said the only person who may make an appeal in the case is 
the independent counsel but noble responded that the governments 
position is that the right to appeal is the attorney generals 
in a written order denying the stay gesell wrote that the ethics 
in government act places all investigative and prosecutorial 
functions in the exclusive control of walsh independent 
counsel walsh opposes the motion he noted 
his irritation with the justice departments belated intervention 
in the case came to the fore on wednesday when he said constant 
interruptions by government intelligence agencies threaten to turn 
the proceedings into a cuckoo clock trial 
the department prodded by the national security agency and cia 
is seeking authority to screen and block disclosure of classified 
material 
there is some information that cannot be put back in a 
bottle deputy assistant attorney general stephen saltzburg said 
wednesday 
but gesell said prior rulings in the case already have addressed 
the issue and installed security safeguards without damaging 
norths right to a fair trial 
this is not a trial of national security its a trial of 
oliver north the judge said 
gesell said he wasnt going to tolerate a cuckoo clock trial 
which would be constantly interrupted by reviews of classified 
material before it is introduced in the courtroom 
the justice department wants a court order saying that north 
cannot disclose any classified information unless it is explicitly 
approved by the court and if the government has no objection to the 
disclosure 
in arguments before gesell on wednesday the justice department 
said north has failed to meet standards required by the classified 
information procedures act 
it said notices from north which are supposed to spell out what 
classified material he plans to use at trial have been either 
totally useless or at best minimally informative 
further it said the court has not ruled on what particular 
classified information is relevant to the issues that will be tried 
and whether it is admissible on some or all issues 
gesell was angry over the delay as jury selection neared 
completion 
you cant ride this horse in both directions the judge said 
you can either move to protect national security or you can move 
to a fair trial congress says that if push comes to shove a trial 
judge has one option to move toward a fair trial 
gesell ruled on jan 19 that north could introduce classified 
information if it tends to show that his purpose was not to break 
the law or if it tends to show that statements made by government 
witnesses are false or misleading 
he also authorized north to divulge information about coverup 
attempts by other officials and about the reagan administrations 
attempts to have other countries provide military assistance to the 
nicaraguan contra rebels after congress banned us aid

soldiers rounded up about 175 palestinians in 
the west bank on thursday and forced them to sit blindfolded and 
bound for up to 16 hours in a soccer stadium arab and israeli 
witnesses said 
riots erupted outside the megiddo prison for a second straight 
day after arab reports circulated that a second palestinian had died 
of wounds sustained in a riot there wednesday israel radio reported 
police said an israeli settler killed when his car went up in 
flames in the west bank on wednesday appeared to be the victim of a 
terror attack but an investigation was continuing 
it is reasonable it was terrorist west bank police commander 
haim malcha said on israel radio even though the results are 
preliminary it seems unreasonable there was any other cause 
israel radio said laboratory tests determined the car was not hit 
by a gasolinefilled bottle or firebomb because no glass fragments 
were found 
but the tests uncovered a large quantity of flammable liquid in 
the drivers seat the radio said it said police suspected the car 
was either hit with a flaming plastic bottle or that gasoline was 
thrown at it 
the settler albert jerassi 38 was the 16th israeli to die 
since the palestinian uprising in the occupied territories began 
dec 8 1987 at least 379 palestinians have died most from israeli 
gunfire 
arab reports said 17yearold nidal zuhdi deeb died after being 
shot by troops trying to quell wednesdays disturbance at megiddo 
prison in northern israel the army said it was checking the report 
the radio said thursdays riot was quickly subdued by prison 
guards and there were no casualties 
in the west bank and gaza strip troops shot and wounded nine 
palestinians including a 9yearold girl and a 10yearold boy from 
gazas mughazi refugee camp arab doctors said both were struck in 
the head with rubbercoated steel bullets they said 
the army did not confirm any of the shootings 
troops with lists of suspects began rounding up palestinians 
overnight in the west bank city of hebron detaining about 175 in a 
soccer stadium where they were forced to sit crosslegged on the 
ground until 230 pm thursday arab witnesses and an israeli 
photographer said 
many were in their pajamas and had their hands tied behind their 
backs some were blindfolded 
the palestinians apparently were suspected of planning an action 
against israeli authorities in hebron israeli sources said 
arab witnesses said the detainees were given water but no food 
one of the palestinians was slapped twice by a soldier they said 
dozens of the detainees were later moved from the soccer field 
apparently to detention centers for questioning the witnesses said 
the rest were sent home 
also thursday the army sealed three palestinian homes and 
demolished a fourth belonging to palestinians accused of attacks on 
israelis 
one of the residences sealed belonged to said dadu who allegedly 
threw explosives at the home of trade and industry minister ariel 
sharon in the arab quarter of the walled old city

here is information about the jurors in oliver 
norths trial they were chosen from a pool of 45 picates to the pilots 
that it may be in their 
interest to honor a machinists picket line said air line pilots 
association spokesman ron cole there appears to be a feeling on 
the companys part that there is no incentive to negotiate with us 
with pilots crossing the picket line that could be very poor 
judgment on the companys part 
cole said his union was making unspecified preparations in case 
pilots decided to honor the picket lines but no final decision 
would come until an actual strike by the machinists 
the machinists meanwhile were voting on whether to authorize a 
strike and militant talk pervaded the ranks 
were ready to rock n roll frank majors a 21year veteran 
line mechanic said after voting to authorize the strike at 
machinists local 702 across the street from company headquarters 
its matter of principle mainly its just time 
majors referred to the demand for 150 million in union wage cuts 
by the management that was installed after the texas air corp led 
by chairman frank lorenzo acquired eastern nearly three years ago 
union officials predicted overwhelming approval of a strike 
which could come if no settlement is reached in their 16monthold 
contract dispute by midnight march 3 
the head of the local easterns machinists charles bryan said 
thursday that eastern is trying to contract out or take the work 
away from eastern employees in violation of federal labor law 
they are now telling all employees to cease production wrap 
up package and box up the parts and send them out for other people

iranianbacked moslem militiamen on thursday 
pulled out of captured villages in the south under terms of a peace 
accord that ended their ninemonth fight with syrianallied forces 
the fundamentalist fighters of hezbollah or party of god took 
refuge in hideouts in mountains near israels security zone but 
there was no immediate move by their shiite rivals the amal 
militia to take over the villages of jbaa and ein bouswar 
some angry villagers said they want both militias to stay out 
ahmad raad a member of jbaas municipal government walked out 
of his bombscarred house and shouted we dont want militiamen 
any more neither amal nor hezbollah 
fatima qobeissie a housewife yelled the militias have ruined 
our village we dont want them back 
three rockets hit our house but luckily we were hiding in a 
bomb shelter she said whos going to compensate us for our 
losses 
the withdrawal was part of a peace treaty reached last month 
under supervision of syria and iran 
the pullout came 39 days after the radical hezbollah seized jbaa 
and ein bouswar in an assault on amal last month amal recaptured 
most of the mountainous region in a string of counteroffensives but 
failed to dislodge hezbollah from the mountaintop villages near 
sidon 
hezbollah official saeed mattout said in jbaa that his forces 
withdrew before dawn to bases on mount safi near the western end of 
the security zone 
israel set up the buffer zone which runs up to 10 miles deep 
into neighboring lebanon when it withdrew most of its occupation 
army from south lebanon in 1985 
mattout said hezbollah may maintain bases on mount safi under the 
damascus agreement 
jamal qalqas an amal representative toured the two villages 
after hezbollah militiamen withdrew and called on civilians who 
evacuated the area during the fighting to return home 
at least 173 people were killed in the fighting that broke out in 
south beirut dec 31 and spread to the shiitedominated south it 
was the latest eruption in a power struggle for control of lebanons 
1 million shiites the countrys biggest sect 
hezbollah advocates creating an iranianstyle islamic republic in 
lebanon 
the more secular and nationalist amal favors a multisect 
government in lebanon in which moslems would hold an equal share of 
power with traditionally dominant christians 
in the chouf mountains southeast of beirut on thursday gunmen 
shot and killed a senior aide of walid jumblatt a druse moslem 
military leader police said 
anwar fatayeri political bureau member of jumblatts progressive 
socialist party was gunned down in an ambush on a road nine miles 
from beirut no one claimed responsibility

organizers of a world famous dog show ordered the 
royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals to remove 
photographs of dead dogs from an exhibit calling them shocking and 
upsetting 
one picture showed a pile of dogs killed by injections because 
their owners could not be found another was of a bulging garbage 
bag captioned this doggy bag contains a dead doggy 
the society used the photographs in fullpage newspaper 
advertisements sunday to launch a campaign for a dog registration 
plan to deter people from buying pet dogs and then abandoning them 
it had included the photos in the societys exhibit at the crufts 
dog show the 103yearold exhibition that began thursday hoping to 
enlist the support of dog lovers 
the charity said that since government licenses for dogs were 
scrapped last year it has had to slaughter 1000 healthy dogs daily 
because their owners cannot be traced 
we do not like this horrorcomic approach said martin 
sinnatt secretary of the kennel club that runs the crufts show

nevada leads the country in suicides and has 
asked the federal officials to study why more than twice as many 
young people than the national average take their lives here 
suicide doesnt just happen state health officer joseph 
jarvis said at a news conference if we can understand why it 
happens to some people and not others maybe we can begin to prevent 
it 
jarvis asked gov bob miller to request the study by the centers 
for disease control they study is expected to take six to nine 
months 
we probably wont be able to come up with all the answers but 
if we can answer one question i would consider it a success cdc 
researcher patrick meeghan said at the news conference wednesday 
he and patrick ocarroll both of the atlantabased centers 
intentional injuries section will look at suicides and attempted 
suicides for trends that might contribute to nevadas unusually high 
rate 
an average of 29 of 100000 residents age 15 to 24 kill 
themselves each year compared to the national rate of 13 per 
100000 in that age group the state recorded 1631 suicides 198287 
until we do the study we dont know if theres something 
special in nevada that makes the rates high meeghan said this 
gives us an opportunity to shed some light on the issue

rep joe skeen rnm unveiled a bill 
thursday aimed at clearing the way for opening the nations first 
permanent nuclear waste repository 
the legislation cosponsored by rep richard stallings didaho 
was designed also to end a political impasse between the energy 
department and the states of idaho and colorado that threatens to 
force the closing of a key nuclear weapons facility 
the bill would give jurisdiction of more than 10000 acres of 
federal lands in southern new mexico to the energy department which 
is seeking to gain safety clearance to open the waste isolation 
pilot plant 
the waste dump had been scheduled to open last october but 
technical problems and questions about the longterm integrity of 
the repository have delayed the opening 
the delay prompted idaho gov cecil andrus late last year to seal 
his states borders against shipments of hazardous wastes from the 
rocky flats plutonium processing plant near denver colorado in 
turn said it would close the plant in may unless a new storage site 
is found for the contaminated materials that have been accumulating 
at rocky flats since andrus imposed his ban 
rocky flats is the only plant capable of processing plutonium for 
nuclear weapons 
andrus has said he would reconsider his ban on waste shipments to 
idaho if certain conditions were met including the introduction of 
legislation to speed the opening of the new mexico repository 
stallings told a news conference it was not clear whether andrus 
was ready to reconsider 
rep bill richardson dnm said he planned to introduce a bill 
later this month that would place stricter environmental conditions 
on opening the repository 
skeen said he and other congressmen with an interest in the waste 
issue would work with richardson to draft a compromise bill to try 
to get the pilot plant open by the end of the year a key point of 
dispute is how much waste material should be allowed into the site 
during an initial testing period 
skeen said the matter could not be resolved until the energy 
department furnished more information about its plans for the 
fiveyear testing program

a japanese man who allegedly came within two 
days of blowing up a manhattan building avoided suspicion by buying 
ingredients for his deadly bombs on a monthlong terrorist shopping 
spree to art supply sporting goods and discount stores in 11 
states documents reveal 
yu kikumura reputedly a member of the japanese red army who 
received terrorist training in lebanons bekka valley entered the 
united states illegally last march 8 and then made his zigzag 
7000mile trek in a used mazda 
court papers show he stayed at motels bed and breakfast rooms 
and campgrounds his travels apparently financed in part by money 
drawn from a swiss bank account 
he didnt tell jokes he didnt laugh in fact he looked like 
a guy with a lot of problems with a lot of troubles on his mind 
carmen brown whose huntington wva campground was one of the 
many places kikumura stayed during his trip said in a telephone 
interview with the associated press 
his odyssey ended at a new jersey turnpike reststop on april 12 
two days before officials said he intended to bomb a navy recruiting 
center housed in a veterans administration building in retaliation 
for the 1986 us bombing of libya 
new jersey state trooper robert cieplensky said he noticed 
kikumura acting erratically as kikumura drove off cieplensky 
stopped him and found in the back seat a package containing three 
bombs hollowedout fire extinguishers filled with gunpowder lead 
shot and with switchs and triggers he also found a map which 
authorities later said showed possible other targets including 
three new york city college campuses 
i would hope that at some point he would have made another 
mistake said assistant us attorney john lacey who helped 
prosecute the case but based on his experience and background i 
have very little doubt that he would have succeeded in killing 
people with those bombs 
on tuesday kikumura claiming the allegations against him were 
fabricated was sentenced to 30 years in prison for explosives and 
weapons charges and carrying false documents including a 
passportkikumuras attorney civil rights lawyer william kunstler 
said an appeal was planned 
investigators used receipts found in kikumuras car to piece 
together his movements in the month before his arrest his travels 
took him to roadside motels through americas heartland across its 
colonial byways and into the bible belt the documents show he spent 
time in massachusetts new york new jersey ohio michigan 
illinois missouri tennessee kentucky west virginia and 
pennsylvania 
along the way he bought items such as gas cans a diet scale 
flash bulbs electrical wire and tape cements epoxy glue and fire 
extinguishers 
the materials he bought to make the bombs are most always used 
for legitimate purposes lacey said and when he traveled around 
to buy the different materials it decreased the risk of somebody 
piecing together what he was doing 
kikumuras favorite store was k mart authorities said 
turn mr kikumura loose near a k mart and a sporting goods 
store and in a matter of hours literally he can make what was 
found in his car today us attorney samuel a alito jr said 
during kikumuras sentencing hearing this week 
alito made a rare appearance in court to present the evidence 
against kikumura who had a record for explosives charges and is 
reputedly a member of the notorious japanese red army a radical 
leftist group formed in the 1960s to promote world revolution 
on may 1 1986 kikumura had been arrested at amsterdams 
schiphol airport with two pounds of tnt and several bomb detonators 
he spent four months in jail after the courts found that authorities 
had conducted an illegal search at the airport 
his whereabouts over the next few months are sketchy but from 
august 1986 until his arrival at new yorks john f kennedy 
international airport last march 8 he used a stolen and altered 
passport to travel through italy france and switzerland 
authorities said 
prosecutors also said an informant has provided evidence that 
kikumura spent some time at a terrorist training camp in lebanons 
bekka valley 
two days after his arrival in the united states kikumura was 
sent by a roommate service to the manhattan apartment of chris 
brande 
he was quiet and polite brande an accountant told the ap 
looking back now i can see a few strange things like he said he 
was a tourist but i never saw a camera 
he didnt look like a terrorist type whatever that type is he 
just seemed like a nice guy 
kikumura bought a used mazda 626 at central motors in the bronx 
within a week of his arrival in the united states and he set out on 
his tour 
on march 16 he was in gloucester mass he traveled west on 
march 22 on interstate 80 through new jersey and pennsylvania and 
stayed overnight at the williams house bed and breakfast in avon 
lake ohio the next night he stayed at barnicks bed and breakfast 
in diamondsdale mich 
the harrison hotel in chicago was his home the night of march 24 
two days later he was in mark twains hometown of hannibal mo he 
also stayed march 28 in the biltmore hotel in union city tenn and 
on march 29 at clardys guest house in murfreesboro tenn 
it didnt make his first known bombparts purchase until march 
30 when he stopped in an art supply store in nashville tenn to 
buy two cans of aluminum powder 
the next day he went to k mart in lexington ky and in two 
visits bought gas cans a diet scale coffeemaker accessories a 
special glue contact cement electrical wire and electrical tape 
on april 1 he arrived at the browns campground 
mrs brown said she and her husband herbert noticed bruises on 
kikumuras hands and a split lip prosecutors theorize he may have 
been injured by a slight blast when mixing the highly combustable 
powder used in the bombs 
while in huntington kikumura went to an electronics store and 
bought a toggle switch circuit tester phone jacks phone plugs and 
wire 
he left for new york on april 3 and stopped at smileys motel in 
hurricane wva on his way back to manhattan

a human error in running a computer has delayed 
450000 federal tax refunds by a week but the irs said thursday 
there is no comparison with the computer problems that made a 
disaster of the 1985 filing season 
the situation was uncovered immediately and remedial steps were 
taken so that no taxpayers were inconvenienced irs spokesman 
frank keith said of the latest problem 
people are going to get their refund checks in the 
fourtosixweek time frame that is typical at this time of the 
year said ellen murphy irs director of public affairs but 
checks for those who filed in the second or third week of january 
will be mailed feb 17 rather than feb 10 as had been planned 
millions of tax refunds were delayed for several weeks in 1985 
because of problems with a new 103 million computer system keith 
was asked whether taxpayers should be worried that the new problem 
might be the first warning of a recurrence 
absolutely not he said 
this year he said there was no problem with the computer itself 
or the instructions fed into it the refund checks were in the 
correct amount the bills that would have been generated were in the 
correct amount 
we learned from the 1985 problems and we wanted to make sure 
that whatever was needed to be done was done that no taxpayer 
would receive an erroneous notice keith said 
the irs deliberately delayed mailing the 450000 refund checks 
as well as any taxdue notices arising from returns filed early this 
year until the human error could be corrected 
that error was made at the irs computing center in martinsburg 
wva where all master files on individual taxpayers are kept and 
where refund checks are authorized 
the problem occurred because the irs late last year announced 
that taxpayers in six states virginia indiana louisiana 
mississippi alabama and minnesota should file their returns to a 
different service center this year in order to even the workload 
among the 10 centers where returns are processed 
virginia taxpayers for example used to file to memphis tenn 
now they file to philadelphia 
but those changes were not taken into account at the martinsburg 
center thus if a virginia taxpayer had a question about his or her 
account or refund the computer would have generated a notice 
directing the taxpayer to correspond with the memphis center rather 
than philadelphia 
to avoid such erroneous notices the irs simply delayed the 
checks 
with the exception of that problem ms murphy said the filing 
season is going well 
through feb 3 she said 845 million returns had been filed 
down 76 percent from the same time last year and 275 million had 
been processed an increase of almost 14 percent the figures are in 
line with recent years when for reasons that neither the irs nor 
outside experts can explain the number of taxpayers filing early 
in the season declined each year 
through jan 27 the irs had certified 95000 refunds totaling 
72 million an average of about 751 per check the number of 
refunds was down 126 percent and the average refund was up 42 
percent 
the irs expects 109 million returns this year and as in most 
years about 75 percent will qualify for refunds 
a check of early returns shows many taxpayers who do not itemize 
deductions are failing to claim the standard deduction the agency 
will correct that error but any refund will be delayed 
another common error is a failure by a filer usually a young 
person with a parttime job to check a box indicating whether he 
or she can be claimed as a dependent by another also near the top 
of the mistake list are mathematics errors failure of lowincome 
working families to claim the earnedincome credit and failing to 
use taxable income to calculate taxes owed

house speaker jim wright said thursday that he 
knew a month ago that the proposed 51 percent congressional pay 
raise would be put to a vote that it was too large and wasnt 
going to wash but his colleagues wouldnt listen 
while defending his handling of the issue the texas democrat 
also indicated that the house would not return to the politically 
sensitive subject anytime soon not even for the judges or top 
federal executives whose increases are linked to congressional pay 
when asked if the pay issue would resurface wright said i 
hope not real soon i can count 
the proposed 51 percent pay raise under heavy public attack 
died tuesday when the house by 38048 and the senate by 946 
passed legislation rejecting the increase and president bush swiftly 
signed the measure 
at a news conference wright said he tried to convince stubborn 
colleagues the proposed raise was too large and that public 
pressure would not let them avoid a vote on the pay plan that had 
been set to automatically become law wednesday 
on monday opponents of raising congressional salaries from 
89500 to 135000 won a procedural vote forcing wright to 
schedule a vote on rejecting the raise before tuesdays midnight 
deadline 
ive known for weeks that ultimately there would be a vote 
wright said i tried to say to my colleagues there would be a 
vote i had known for four weeks that 50 percent wasnt going to 
wash 
but wright said legislators werent willing to listen because 
if i had called for a vote sooner members would have said i gave 
away their pay raise 
asked if he would have done anything differently wright said 
that i would have probably have done the house a service if i had 
been able to prevail on colleagues to see three weeks earlier that 
letting the raise become law without a vote was not going to be 
accepted 
i didnt succeed in that so be it he said postmortems 
are not really productive 
before he gave in wright had planned to seek a smaller raise 
with steps that would have allowed the 51 percent increase take 
effect followed by a vote to scale it back to 30 percent the next 
day that plan also called for a vote on eliminating acceptance of 
speaking fees 
but wright said he knew such a plan was too late and wasnt in 
the cards even before he proposed it 
there was a time when a proposal to do away with honoraria and 
reduce the increase to 30 percent was justifiable and would have 
been acceptable but by the time i advocated it it was too late 
he said 
wright denied that the episode weakened his power saying members 
are assuring him every day that this isnt true 
the speaker said bush asked him if he should propose a smaller 
increase than the 51 percent and the speaker said he replied i 
tried that and it didnt work to well for me

the episcopal church is mustering full pomp and 
ceremony to install barbara harris as the first woman bishop in a 
2000year christian line dating to the apostles 
the worldwide attention expected for saturdays events goes far 
beyond anything the episcopal church usually confronts and reflects 
a debate that has simmered within church ranks and now threatens to 
spill over into christianity at large 
some 8300 tickets have already been distributed for the 
consecration demand has forced church officials to move the 
ceremony from st pauls cathedral in boston to the cavernous hynes 
convention center which has room for spectators a chorus of 130 
television cameras and a large contingent of journalists 
though no one is announcing any lastminute effort to block the 
appointment a good many of the attendees can be expected to hold 
their breath when the ritual requires presiding bishop edmund 
browning to intone if any of you know any reason why we should 
not proceed let it now be made known 
the 58yearold former head of a leftwing religious publishing 
company has been a subject of some controversy within the church 
since sept 24 when the episcopal diocese of boston elected her 
suffragan or assistant bishop 
women have been priests in the episcopal church since 1976 but 
becoming an bishop is a question of much higher magnitude harris 
would become the first woman to reach that height in any of the 
three major branches of christianity roman catholicism eastern 
orthodoxy and anglicanism that trace bishops in a direct line back 
to the apostles of jesus 
after the election last september debate quickly ensued across 
the country among 118 church committees responsible for confirming 
the election 
a traditionalist faction of the episcopal church led by the 
evangelical and catholic mission in austin texas rallied in 
opposition to harris elevation now prelates and observers on both 
sides of the issue are concerned that the stakes may be even larger 
than the unity of the episcopal church which is a branch of 
worldwide anglicanism 
the roman catholic eastern orthodox and anglican churches have 
been involved for more than a decade in discussions over easing 
their centuriesold differences and they have made great 
progress said james solheim a spokesman for the boston episcopal 
diocese for roman catholics the idea of a woman standing at the 
altar representing christ is totally unacceptable 
pope john paul ii in december issued what solheim called 
ominous noises about the impending consecration of harris the 
pope warned of painful and deplorable consequences of the 
episcopal church going forward with the consecration of a female 
bishop the constant line of tradition common to all the 
churches cannot be so easily interupted he said 
this has great ecumenical consequences said bishop donald 
davies of the evangelical and catholic mission in austin 
a female bishop might be acceptable if all of christianity 
approved in an official way he said but were a small church in 
taking the leadership in this we just denigrate the progress weve 
made in having communion throughout the world 
barbara clementine harris this week was the calm at the center of 
the storm recovering from a head cold on a church retreat she 
could not be reached for comment because she has no access to a 
telephone at the retreat solheim said 
some of the opposition to her elevation stemmed from her 
decidedly leftist political views which she conveyed in the 
publication the witness issued by the episcopal church publishing 
co in philadelphia where she has been an episcopal priest since 
1980 
the periodical has published articles supporting homosexual 
rights and the nicaraguan sandinista government and criticizing the 
church for failing to fully bring women into church leadership 
the rev jerome politzer president of the traditionalist prayer 
book society in america described harris as promarxist her 
writings are snide and sarcastic she is unfit to be a bishop 
some also have questioned harris qualifications because of her 
lack of a college degree and full seminary training 
a black woman and a veteran of the civil rights marches of the 
1960s harris has been outspoken for civil rights and feminism and 
she is unapologetic about her views 
but at a recent news conference in boston harris sought to ease 
concerns by saying her work for the boston diocese would focus on 
sacramental and pastoral duties rather than involvement in political 
affairs

supplies are so short in veterans 
administration hospitals that nurses are scrounging thee little 
souvenir bars of soap and shampoo bottles from hotels to bring to va 
patients a nurse told congress on thursday 
supply accounts are frequently raided to pay salaries and avoid 
layoffs an outside medical administrator told the house veterans 
affairs committee 
claudette morissey a nurse at the brooklyn ny veterans 
hospital and prsident of the nurses organization of the veterans 
administration said in testimony submitted to the hearing at one 
va hospital in the south nurses were frustrated by the refusal of 
the prosthetics department to supply wheel chair cushions for 
patients on the long term care unit 
the nurses obtained a 25 donation went to the local 
upholstery store and purchased a large foam mattress and with an 
electric knife borrowed from the mother of one of the nurses cut 
the foam to make wheel chair cushions for their patients 
she did not identify the hospital nor the hospital in other 
anecdotes 
nurses in one hospital brought in souvenir hotel soaps and 
shampoos for the patients and in another brought and cut large 
bars of soap in small pieces for patients to use 
at her own hospital she said we cannot properly monitor 
diabetic patients when there are no lancets to do finger sticks no 
chem sticks for blood samples and no insulin syringes to use to give 
insulin if it is needed this is the situation i have faced over the 
past month at my facility and i thank god there has been no crisis 
because of it 
a soviet report last week of hospital patients getting aids from 
unsterilized needles is a startling reminded to us in this country 
that mistakes can happen when the system starts to cut corners and 
workers perform daily under inordinate pressure as we do in the 
va she said 
at congressional hearings last september va officials said they 
faced a 600 million to 1 billion shortfall in their 1054 billion 
budget for medical care in the current fiscal year 
edward derwinski president bushs nominee for head of the va and 
secretary of veterans affairs when the va becomes a cabinet 
department next month said tuesday he had met with budget director 
richard darman 
declining to say if he thought a supplemental appropriation is 
needed for the current fiscal year derwinski said the meeting with 
darman didnt result in any figure changes but i hope itll 
increase his sensitivity 
l thompson bowles vice president for medical affairs at the 
george washington university medical center a member of a va 
advisory committee and a consulting surgeon to two va hospitals 
said by moving funds from other accounts the department of 
medicine and surgery was able to remain near the congressionally 
mandated 194720 employment level 
kenneth i shine dean of the university of california at los 
angeles medical school told the committee that next years medical 
budget should be 1242 billion a 14 percent or 148 billion 
increase over this years total instead of the 186 million 
increase proposed in president reagans budget four veterans 
organizations have endorsed a similar amount for next year

helicopters serving one of the few midwest 
hospitals to perform heart transplants on children are drawing flak 
from neighbors who say the aircraft are overused and pose a 
potential safety hazard 
however a hospital official countered thursday that childrens 
memorial hospital has taken great pains to keep the helicopters 
disturbance to a minimum since it began using them a couple of years 
ago 
herbert malkind planning committee chairman of the park west 
community association said the hospital has failed to obey zoning 
laws and an agreement with community groups to use the helicopters 
only for emergencies trips longer than 40 miles and for its own 
staff 
malkind testified wednesday before a hearing officer gathering 
material on the hospitals application to be certified as a 
pediatric heart transplant center by the illinois health facilities 
planning authority 
the helistop is controversial in lincoln park from the 
standpoint of safety concerns and noise problems malkind said of 
the surrounding affluent north side neighborhood 
we think its a very good hospital we really do frank 
giarrizzo a lincoln park resident who also attended the hearing 
said thursday we just say live up to the agreements follow the 
laws 
the suggestion that childrens has violated its agreements or the 
law is totally untrue said edward horner president of the 
childrens memorial foundation and a representative of the hospital 
at the hearing 
because donor hearts remain viable for just four hours outside 
the body they must be flown into childrens requiring more 
helicopter flights he said 
however he said the hospital goes out of its way to keep 
helicopter use to a minimum and noted that the total number of 
helicopter landings and takeoffs actually dropped last year compared 
to 1987 from 201 to 195 
there is no restriction on the number of helicopter flights 
allowed horner said 
childrens has performed five heart transplants since its first 
one last may our estimate is we do not believe more than 12 of 
these transplants could or would be done a year based on the 
difficulty of getting donor hearts horner added 
he said quarterly reports on helicopter use distributed to 
community groups clearly reflect the hospitals proper use of the 
vehicles 
we took extraordinary efforts to involve the community when 
the helicopter service began he said thursday sound testing 
equipment was placed in homes and businesses and community hearings 
were held to address safety and noise said horner 
he said he believes only a few people are complaining and that 
they are not representative of most of the neighborhood 
giarrizzo said area residents do not oppose certification for 
childrens but believe the hospital should be required to tighten 
up its use of helicopters before it is granted official status as a 
transplant center 
in addition to the many homes around the hospital a school and a 
church are right across the street giarrizzo said 
safety concerns center on the hospitals use of twinengine 
helicopters which carry more fuel than the singleengine 
helicopters childrens originally agreed to use and could presumably 
cause greater damage in the event of a crash he said 
the hospitals bid for certification has very little to do with 
helicopters said horner 
it has a whole lot to do with the societal obligation of 
childrens which transcends lincoln park its a societal 
obligation that an institution of this ilk must fulfill 
childrens cardiology service treats about 4000 young people a 
year about 10 percent of whom require heart surgery of some sort 
making the hospital one of the largest of its kind in the country 
horner said 
the board of the planning authority is to act on childrens 
application for certification at its march 2 meeting said authority 
executive secretary ray passeri

a new campaign by the plymouth division of 
chrysler motors to promote the scenic byways program in national 
forests got the green light thursday at the agriculture department 
a threeway partnership was worked out with the californiabased 
forest education foundation plymouth and usda to help upgrade 
designated scenic stretches of highways into major tourist 
attractions 
f dale robertson chief of the forest service said the 191 
million acres of national forests if gathered in one place an 
area larger than texas offer some of americas most spectacular 
scenery 
this partnership will allow us to showcase the beauty of these 
areas for the american public nearly half of whom spend part of 
their leisure time driving for enjoyment he said 
robertson told a news conference the venture is the first major 
national cooperative effort undertaken by his agency with a private 
corporation the agreement is for three years and could be renewed 
the scenic byway program began last year with the designation of 
a 26mile stretch of us highway 64 in southeastern tennessee so 
far 30 have been designated covering 1676 miles and others are 
being identified for addition to the system 
one goal is to upgrade the highway areas to make them more useful 
and entertaining for motorists projects can include interpretive 
signs improved road maintenance pullouts at scenic overlooks 
parking areas some rest area facilities and shortloop walking 
trails 
according to an information folder by the nonprofit foundation 
plymouth will publicize the byways through an ambitious 
promotional program which includes 20 exhibitions at heavily 
attended regional consumer shows discreet signage in 3500 plymouth 
dealerships and in 700 hightraffic retail locations and ski 
areas 
the promotion also includes a national sweepstakes with a 
plymouth as grand prize which was on display in usdas indoor 
patio a 4door midsize acclaim with a window sticker listing all 
the options and a price of 14224 
robertson said the forest services involvement with plymouth and 
the foundation is strictly on behalf of the byways program and that 
the company will not be using our logo on any of its products or 
is receiving any endorsement by the agency 
but robertson and pat smorra general marketing manager for 
plymouth dodged reporters questions about details of the financial 
arrangement between the agency and the company 
smorra said that he was not announcing the exact dollars were 
putting into the program but it is extensive in terms of 
communication efforts as well as promotional efforts 
robertson said the budget proposed for the forest service in the 
1990 fiscal year that will begin oct 1 calls for 15 million for 
challenge costshare projects which includes the byways program 
so we would anticipate at least that amount in 1990 and 
perhaps some more of our budget going into it he said 
the funds call for matching dollars at least from approved 
participants to carry out the costshare projects 
there is some upfront cash from plymouth but im not free to 
say how much right now robertson said

authorities on thursday 
found the cockpit voice recorder of a chartered us jetliner that 
slammed into a mountain and killed all 144 people aboard and they 
recovered the remains of all but two of the dead 
rescuers called off the search for the two bodies still missing 
saying it would be impossible to find them on the heavily forested 
slopes of pico alto mountain where the jet crashed wednesday 
antonio alves of the civilian aviation authority said it was 
hoped the recorder would help explain why the pilot steered the 
boeing 707 directly into the mountain while trying to land in a fog 
the sevenmember american crew and the 137 passengers italian 
tourists headed to a caribbean vacation were killed 
in lisbon cmdr jose pastor of the aviation authority said the 
pilot capt leon daugherty had acknowledged the airport control 
towers authorization of a safety altitude of 3000 feet during the 
landing approach 
pastor said the plane struck the mountain at an altitude of about 
1700 feet 
there was no repeat no communication of an emergency 
landing request by the pilot he said earlier reports indicated 
the pilot may have asked to make an emergency landing 
alves said it appeared the aircraft had been on the proper course 
to land it was to refuel on santa maria island before continuing on 
to the dominican republic 
alves said the cockpit voice recorder had been recovered but the 
flight data recorder which contains information on the aircrafts 
flight parameters had not yet been found 
jose martins freitas head of the azores rescue service said he 
didnt believe it was possible to find anything more remains at the 
crash site on the slippery dense slopes of the 1794foot pico 
alto the highest point on the island rescuers found 50 bodies on 
wednesday 
the smell of oil hung in the damp air and a light rain fell on 
debris that included playing cards a book of fairy tales and 
vacation clothing still neatly folded 
members of a sixman team from the us national transportation 
safety board including representatives of boeing and the federal 
aviation administration were expected to arrive to help with the 
investigation 
the jet was owned by independent air corp of smyrna tenn which 
was expected to send representatives to lisbon for talks with 
aviation officials 
the 20yearold jetliner had a relatively low number of flight 
hours and no history of serious problems company president al 
pittman said the craft one of two boeing 707s the company owned 
had logged 12500 cycles or takeoffs and landings and fewer than 
50000 hours in the air 
jack barker a spokesman for the us federal aviation 
administration agreed the figures were not excessive he said 
independent air was fined 18000 in an faa enforcement action in 
1984 but he said it was not possible to learn why immediately 
the mayor of vila do porto jose humberto chaves said the faa 
checks the airport used primarily as a midatlantic refueling stop 
every six months and that an average of three flights a day stop 
there santa maria is about 750 miles from the portuguese mainland 
the airport reportedly the largest in the azores has no radar 
but uses an instrument landing system to guide pilots 
the remains of the dead were being moved from a makeshift hanger 
at the airport to freezers at a food processing plant in vila do 
porto to await the arrival of an italian air force c130 transport 
plane carrying coffins from pisa italian investigating magistrate

he would never move to unseat mayor marion s barry jr 
ive expressed no interest in the job jackson said after 
leading an antidrug rally at a city high school under no 
condition would i run against marion barry 
asked later if he would run if barry decided not to seek 
reelection in 1990 jackson said i have expressed no desire to be 
mayor 
instead jackson said he plans to continue taking his antidrug 
message to school children around the country and press the bush 
administration on its promise to make fighting drugs a top priority 
jackson who owns a home here has been mentioned as a possible 
mayoral candidate since december when barrys repeated visits to 
the hotel room of a drug suspect triggered the worst political 
crisis in barrys 10 years as mayor 
recent polls show barrys popularity has dropped and remains low 
since a federal grand jury began probing his ties to the drug 
suspect former city employee charles lewis 
barry has not yet said publicly if he will seek another term 
speculation over jacksons possible candidacy grew after he said 
in early january he was worried about barrys health the mayor also 
said that the two had a moving tearful prayer session after 
jackson telephoned him from africa 
jackson also refused to comment when asked thursday whether he 
was still concerned about barrys health and personal habits 
during his speech jackson made no mention of barrys troubles 
and characterized his formal civil rights ally as a close personal 
friend 
barry who arrived for the rally about 15 minutes late was 
greeted with a mixture of cheers and catcalls from the 1000 
students in the schools auditorium by contrast jackson received a

democrats said thursday that defense 
secretarydesignate john towers nomination will rise or fall on the 
answers to outstanding questions but republicans rallied to his 
side one complaining of a feeding frenzy of allegations 
sen sam nunn the armed services committee chairman who has said 
he would formally oppose the nomination if a vote were held now 
said hed be ready to work with tower if the confirmation goes 
through no matter how he himself had voted 
however nunn dga also renewed his public doubts saying 
there are questions that still have not been answered to my 
satisfaction i do not foreclose the possibility that there may be 
satisfactory answers but i have not received them yet 
nunn has delayed a committee vote on the nomination at least 
until feb 21 the senate will be in recess until then so the fbi 
can review allegations of a financial nature against the former 
texas senator other questions involve towers use of alcohol nunn 
said 
his position was echoed by several other democrats on the 
20member armed services committee which tower once headed 
one of them sen timothy wirth dcolo said i told sen 
nunn that my instincts are very much like his if the vote were held 
tomorrow i could not vote for sen tower 
republicans meanwhile hurried to towers defense 
what bothers me is there is a feeding frenzy here said sen 
trent lott rmiss i am worried that we begin to judge this 
nomination on the weight of the allegations instead of the weight of 
the evidence ninetyeight percent of this stuff is totally 
unfounded 
republican sens pete wilson of california malcolm wallop of 
wyoming and john mccain of arizona also commented in favor of tower 
and the white house also pressed vice president dan quayle into 
service telephoning senators on towers behalf 
david beckwith quayles spokesman said the vice president a 
former member of the committee called about a halfdozen members 
from each party to assure the senators that president bush was 
standing behind his nominee 
nunn called the lengthy review of towers personal and 
professional life painful but said if the senate approves him 
i for one will be leading the way to try to work with him 
whatever my vote may end up being 
the fbis background inquiry centers on contributions to one of 
towers senate campaigns by a defense contractor now under 
investigation in the pentagon procurement probe codenamed 
operation ill wind according to an administration official who 
spoke on condition he remain anonymous 
but the official said there is no evidence of wrongdoing by tower 
records on file at the federal election commission show that in 
june 1983 tower received a 500 campaign contribution from charles 
f gardner a retired unisys corp employee under investigation in 
ill wind an investigation of alleged corruption in the 
pentagons 150billionyear purchasing system 
gardners donation to the tower campaign was within the 1000 
limit for individual contributions telephone calls to gardners 
home were unanswered thursday 
also thursday nunn said he was upset at having to take the blame 
for delaying the tower vote a postponement he said was made at the 
request of white house counsel c boyden gray 
on the one hand were being told to wait because there is a 
serious allegation initiated by the administration on the other 
hand were being told that we should vote immediately or that were 
being criticized for bringing up new allegations so that is a 
little frustrating 
bjay cooper a white house spokesman said bush wanted a vote as 
soon as possible but realized that was impossible until the fbi 
report was finished 
since bush selected tower the exsenator has been dogged by 
allegations and rumors that he was a womanizer and excessive 
drinker which tower denies 
none of the previous allegations some spawned by his exwife 
lilla burt cummings and most checked out by the fbi over the past 
two months pose a problem to towers nomination white house 
officials say 
but sen jeff bingaman dnmex said there was no question 
the delay is hurting his prospects 
democratic sens carl levin of michigan richard shelby of 
alabama and james exon of nebraska have also expressed reservations 
about voting for tower until they see the fbis completed report 
lott acknowledged that tower is not snow white when it comes 
to drinking alcohol but said im convinced hes not an 
alcoholic that he does not now have a drinking problem tower has 
said he drinks modestly usually a little wine 
a number of senators declined to talk about the tower nomination 
including sen strom thurmond rsc who served with tower in the 
senate for 24 years

un military observers trying to cement 
a fragile ceasefire between iran and iraq say rival forces still 
glare at each other from less than 25 yards away in some parts of 
the front 
the peacekeepers constantly patrol the tense front lines which 
stretch from the snowy kurdistan mountain in the north to the 
southern deserts they travel on foot or in military vehicles 
painted white 
the temperature in the north today was minus 31 centrigrade 
said lt col john fisher a new zealander with the un iraniraq 
military observer group in the southern sector of the 730mile front 
between the neighboring nations but here in the south it was 31 
plus in the north our observers operate on skis or snowshoes 
he said the process of cementing the ceasefire is slow work 
were still involved in negotiations with both sides about 
disengagement said fisher 
in the six months since the aug 20 unsponsored ceasefire 
took effect the un observers have negotiated with both sides to 
achieve a buffer zone up to 1mile wide fisher told a group of 
foreign correspondents wednesday 
the un observers base camp which comprises neat rows of 
portable cabins pained white is about 25 miles south of ahvaz 
capital of irans oilrich khuzestan province and one of the most 
heavily damaged regions during the war 
a long drive through the region indicated that life is generally 
back to normal in the region 
ahvaz a sprawling market town and oil center bustled during the 
day at night its wide treelined avenues were ablaze with 
thousands of colored lights strung from lamp posts and buildings for 
the 10day celebrations marking the 10th anniversary of the islamic 
revolution 
in the flat dusty countryside near the front women tilled and 
watered the fields while men repaired wardamaged buildings or built 
new houses to replace those lost in heavy iraqi bombing 
in the area around the small town of susangerd once occupied by 
iraqi soldiers irans special construction crusade brigades were 
busy helped by villagers the teams of bearded young men of the 
islamic revolutionary guards corps were digging new irrigation 
canals or extending existing ones with earthmoving machinery 
the concrete canals which could serve as antitank ditches if 
fighting breaks out again run for miles along the border 
despite the ceasefire both armies still have large forces along 
the ceasefire line 
fisher acknowledged that in some stretches the rival forces are 
still only 25 yards apart 
he also said truce violations have occurred as reported 
on the whole he added its been very quiet i see no 
reason why it shouldnt continue like this 
he declined comment on a statement by iranian foreign minister 
ali akbar velayati that the iraqis recently seized 39 square miles 
of iranian territory 
the iranians say the iraqis still occupy a total of more than 380 
square miles of their territory 
with un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar striving to 
break the deadlock in the talks aimed at a permanent settlement 
fisher commented the future is in the hands of the politicians 
the iranians have said that resuming talks that broke down in 
november was futile unless iraq withdraws from iranian soil iraq 
rejects any preconditions 
the un security council on wednesday extended the un 
observers mandate for another six months it repeated its calls for 
iran and iraq to withdraw their forces to the prewar border one of 
the key provisions of the ceasefire resolution passed in july 1987 
at least 1 million people were killed or wounded in the war 
which began with an iraqi invasion in september 1980 after several 
border skirmishes some estimates of the dead alone surpass 1 
million and the economic cost totals hundreds of billions of 
dollars 
fisher said new officers have been arriving to replace those in 
the 409member un force from 26 countries 
diplomats in baghdad reported wednesday that 10 officers from 
iran and 10 from iraq will meet in a nomans land in the central 
sector this month in an effort to advance the ceasefire provisions

an envoy for the rebels fighting the angolan 
government said thursday he is seeking additional us antiaircraft 
and antitank missiles to combat a predicted offensive by 
cubanbacked troops 
tony da costa fernandes who holds the rank of brigadier general 
in the union for the total independence of angola also urged the 
united states to improve the monitoring of cuban troop pullout from 
angola against any attempts by cuba to cheat 
fernandes said at a news conference that he was satisfied with 
the meetings he has had with us officials about his 
organizations requests 
but he also criticized parts of the ussponsored agreement 
signed last december that calls for the pullout of all cuban troops 
from angola and grants independence to neighboring namibia from 
south african rule 
there are flaws in the agreement that are not of our liking 
he said 
fernandes urged the united states to use sophisticated means 
to monitor the troop withdrawal claiming that cuba had sent in 
fresh troops to replace some of the 3000 who were pulled out under 
the agreement last month 
he said there were no accurate figures for cuban troops who have 
been helping the marxist angolan government since it gained 
independence from portugal in 1975 troop estimates from a variety 
of sources have ranged from between 50000 and 60000 
under the agreement cuba has promised to provide accurate 
figures by april 1 once the 90member un observer group is in 
place the commander of the force brazilian gen pericles ferreira 
gomes says his 10nation group will rely on angolan and cuban 
figures during the withdrawal 
but fernandes said that could lead to cheating he said the 
27month pullout timetable means cuban troops will remain in angola 
one year after namibian independence giving cuba a chance to send 
some of the troops to its ally namibia 
based on troop movements and weapon stockpiling fernandes 
predicted that cubanbacked angolan troops would launch two or three 
offensives against unita in southern angola between may and july 
before the aug 1 deadline for the cubans to move northward of the 
15th parallel 
he said unita needs longrange artillery pieces antiaircraft 
and antitank missiles the united states already provides unita 
with shoulderfired stinger antiaircraft missiles and tow antitank 
missiles as part of a covert aid package estimated at 15 million 
annually 
fernandes said unita needs more arms because the soviets recently 
delivered to angola 12 cubanflown mig25 fighter jets and some 
mi35 helicopter gunships 
a us official speaking on condition of anonymity says 
fernandes met with several people in the state department but she 
declined to elaborate we provide appropriate and adequate 
assistance to unita she said but said policy bans discussion of 
covert aid 
much of unitas arsenal which is mostly of soviet origin was 
brought in through south africancontrolled territory but this has 
stopped under terms of the tripartite agreement along with the 80 
million south african annual aid package he said 
in a separate interview fernandes said unita had increased the 
capability of all airfields to accommodate longrange aircraft 
indicating that these bases would be used to resupply the 
organization now that its land lines have been blocked 
he also said unita has a twotothree year stock of military 
equipment it received through south africa and from three african 
countries which he declined to name 
despite reports to the contrary unita enjoys moral and 
diplomatic support from about 15 other african states he added 
at the news conference fernandes said he had asked the united 
states to send a signal to several african nations such as senegal 
and kenya of support for a dialogue between unita and the angolan 
government 
such a signal would spur these governments to put pressure on 
angola to negotiate a ceasefire and powersharing agreement with 
the rebels he said 
unita will not accept a government offer for clemency because 
we are not criminals fernandes said preferring to increase its 
military struggle to place additional pressure on the government to 
negotiate

child care experts thursday criticized 
president bushs proposed 1000 child care tax credit as being too 
low and insufficient to address the range of problems faced by most 
parents 
its really irrelevant to the child care needs of the united 
states said edward f zigler director of the bush center in 
child development and social policy at yale university 
zigler speaking as the house labor and education committee 
opened a series of hearings on child care called the proposal a 
nonsolution 
and the amount of money is too low in an era where child care 
costs 3000 and 4000 a year 1000 doesnt do much for that 
said w norton grubb a professor of education at the university of 
california at berkeley 
the committee estimates fulltime child care costs at an average 
3000 annually per child that means a family with two children in 
which both parents work at minimum wage spends more than half its 
income for child care 
zigler a strong proponent of schoolbased daycare said the 
bush proposal doesnt address the obstacles faced by singleworking 
mothers or move to eliminate the twotier care system he said is 
developing between lowincome families and others who can afford 
private care 
grubb said bushs failure to include a system of regulation in 
the proposal would result in poor families spending the money for 
other needs 
the money in that proposal is not restricted to child care 
most of the funds in that proposal if enacted would not go for 
child care they would go for food housing utilities clothing and 
other necessities like that said grubb 
deborah phillips a university of virginia professor of 
psychology told the panel the proposal doesnt address the quality 
of day care she said quality should not be sacrificed because 
government policy frames it as a luxury issue in child care 
meanwhile sen bob packwood of oregon ranking republican on the 
finance committee said he will introduce a bill to expand existing 
child care tax credits for families with incomes under 25000 and 
assist states in improving current programs 
packwoods proposal would provide a maximum tax credit of 960 
for one child and 1920 for two or more children the credit would 
be fully refundable and could be made available through payroll 
withholdings 
current law provides for tax savings of 720 for one child and 
1440 for two or more children and it is not refundable

its been more than a year since the last state 
of the union report to congress but president bushs address to a 
joint session thursday night was billed merely as a speech about his 
budget priorities 
the constitution requires that the president shall from time to 
time give to the congress information of the state of the union and 
recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge 
necessary and expedient 
the last state of the union address to congress was given by 
ronald reagan on jan 25 1988 at the time the white house said it 
was the last state of the union address reagan would make i person 
but that he would deliver a written report before leaving office in 
january 1989 
as it turned out reagan did not prepare a written state of the 
union report instead reagan gave what was called a farewell 
address from the oval office that was broadcast to the nation last 
month 
discussing bushs address we do not consider this a state of 
the union address because its largely focused on the budget and not 
the state of the world affairs said white house deputy press 
secretary b jay cooper 
despite the white house disclaimer the house and senate last 
week adopted a resolution providing for a joint session of 
congress to receive a message from the president on the state of the 
union 
although there has not been an official state of the union 
address in more than a year cooper noted there have been three 
major presidential addresses including reagans farewell bushs 
inaugural speech and bushs budget address

michael dukakis presidential campaign has not 
yet filed federal reports covering more than 31 million in 
expenses incurred during the final month of last years race for the 
white house aides to the massachusetts governor said thursday 
jack corrigan a former campaign aide to dukakis who now works in 
the governors office said expenses were not reported because the 
money went out in the form of vouchers that allowed staffers to 
withdraw cash and the campaigns accountants were awaiting the 
documents needed to report what the money bought 
because of the pace of events in the closing weeks of the 
campaign not all of the paperwork has made its way through 
corrigan said 
the events of the last month are not reflected he said in a 
telephone interview from boston 
according to the report filed feb 2 at the fec dukakis had more 
than 39 million on hand with nearly 13 million in unpaid debts 
indicating that the campaign had a surplus of some 26 million 
however corrigan said the report did not include more than 31 
million in vouchers that were paid but not listed because the 
supporting documents were not yet available figured with the money 
owed to the campaign and the cash on hand the campaign should wind 
up within 3500 of being broke he said 
the 1984 presidential campaign of sen john glenn dohio was 
fined by the federal election commission for failing to report 
expenses in a timely manner during that campaign according to fec 
records 
an attorney for the dukakis campaign carol darr said she would 
look into the current matter and we will correct it immediately 
if anything is wrong we have been extremely careful all along 
she said 
following an audit of the glenn campaign the election commission 
charged it with violating the law for failing to report 312495 in 
expenses in a timely manner last year the glenn campaign agreed to 
pay a 30000 fine a relatively large sum to be levied by the fec 
but that also included penalties for other related violations 
although the commission has told campaigns that using bank drafts 
is an acceptable practice it has warned them against taking too 
long to report the expenses 
draft transactions are reported in the period in which the 
draft is paid by the bank the commission said in a manual 
provided for presidential campaigns 
ms darr said she was not familiar with the commisison ruling in 
the glenn case or the warning in the manual on bank drafts 
stuff like this is very technical she said

a group of arab americans announced a campaign 
thursday against a leading jewish human rights group over a letter 
alleging that arabs on college campuses are poisoning the minds of 
our young 
the american arab antidiscrimination committee accused bnai 
brith international of sending hate literature to its members 
in a fundraising letter designed to combat antisemitic propaganda 
and cult influence on jewish college students 
bnai brith issued a statement questioning why the arab 
organization was continuing its campaign after bnai brith has 
publicly admitted that it was in error in using a phrase that may be 
considered offensive 
the adc is apparently anxious to keep the matter alive and 
festering in order to score cheap points and damage the relationship 
between jews and arabs in the united states said the statement 
the jewish organization said that the letter composed by an 
outside mailing house was a mistake and that unmailed copies had 
been withdrawn two weeks ago the organization has apologized 
privately to the arab group but has rejected demands that it reveal 
how many such letters were sent saying only that it was not a mass 
mailing 
the letter was signed by seymour reich who serves as president 
of bnai brith international and who was chosen last month as head 
of the conference of presidents of major jewish organizations 
the americanarab committee has asked reich to tell all the 
original recipients that he dissociates himself from the first 
letter and bnai brith spokesman art shulman said thursday reich 
had done so reichs new letter says the views stated in the 
previous one do not reflect our views the incident was an 
unfortunate mistake shulman quoted the second letter as saying 
nonetheless the arab group has asked the internal revenue 
service to examine the tax exempt status of bnai brith which is 
based on the organizations description of itself as an educational 
institution said committee spokesman faris bouhafa a similar 
request has gone to the postal service which grants such 
institutions preferred rates he said 
every day we are subjected to a deluge of antisemitic 
propaganda on college campuses the original letter said this 
is a deliberate and wellorganized campaign to undermine the basic 
beliefs and values of our young people our children and 
grandchildren it said 
the arab presence on the college campus is poisoning the minds 
of our young people the letter said 
while cults and cultists are lurking around every corner bnai 
brith is there to battle against the very real threats to 
judaism 
bouhafa said his organization objects to the letters association 
of arabs with cultists and to the association of legitimate 
political activity on the part of arab americans with 
antisemitism 
the committee has asked 575 civil rights and religious 
organizations to sign an open protest letter to reich 
for an organization known for its antidiscrimination efforts 
it is dismaying to see discrimination against another ethnic 
group said a letter to reich from the womens division of the 
united methodist church

a hospital has stopped telling clergy the religious 
backgrounds of new admissions after some patients complained they 
were startled to see priests or rabbis walk into their rooms 
it frightens people when a priest walks in with a rosary 
said carolyn lipp a spokeswoman for humana hospital biscayne 
they think theyre dying and that were holding something back 
the policy instigated three weeks ago instructs administrators 
to release patients names only if the patient approves beforehand 
however clergy who frequent the hospital complain that the new 
procedure makes it impossible for them to minister to the sick 
hospital officials and religious representatives discussed the 
policy at a special meeting wednesday 
ms lipp said the hospital has stopped handing out a daily list 
that gives a rundown of every patient and his or her religious 
denomination because it may violate privacy laws and because of 
patients complaints 
the hospital also discovered that some of those soliciting lists 
were impostors more interested in the free lunch clergy receive at 
the hospital 
since the policy took effect clergy have seen the number of 
calls they receive drop sharply down to one or two a day 
you dont throw the baby out with the dirty water just because 
there have been a few complaints said rabbi solomon schiff 
director of chaplaincy for the greater miami jewish federation 
visits by qualified clergy have always been regarded as 
something that assists the patient in his or her recovery he said 
ms lipp said the real difficulty for the clergy is that only 
about 10 percent of the patients wish to have a visit 
what they dont understand and what they are not accepting is 
that most of these people dont want to see them she said 
many people go to church only once a year or not at all she 
said and dont feel comfortable in the presence of clergy youre 
sick youre not at your best maybe youre here for something very 
personal ms lipp said they dont want to see some strange 
minister 
but to assuage the clergy the hospital agreed to emphasize the 
question during admissions and have patients sign a card accepting 
or rejecting religious visitors 
ministers at other hospitals however see the move as a bad 
trend 
this sounds to me like an antireligious move said the rev 
charles clements of the roman catholic archdiocese of miami it 
certainly causes complications in ministering to the sick if you 
cant find them

the tragedy is a reflection of the consequences the excessive 
deregulation of airline traffic can bring

flight had expressed worry about the soundness of the aircraft on 
which she had flown to the dominican republic twice before ansa 
reported

plane late last year and there was condensation inside some baggage 
was wet at the end of the flight and the oxygen masks popped out 
when it landed 
i had wanted to protest to the agency that organized the 
vacation and write an open letter to the newspapers but then work 
commitments absorbed me and today i am here crying about not having 
done it she said

the government said thursday it 
will not let a hunger strike by 300 black inmates change its policy 
of imprisonment without trial 
the hunger strike is perhaps the strongest challenge to the 
policy of detention without trial since president pw botha 
declared a national state of emergency in june 1986 
meanwhile a un report released in geneva charged the 
government with state terrorism against the black majority the 
138page report said that children continue to be victims of torture 
and other inhuman treatment 
the report said news accounts of the problem are being distorted 
by censorship and other media restrictions as well as by official 
south african propaganda 
leliel mikuin balanda of zaire who headed the group that drew up 
the report told reporters thursday that the situation in south 
africa was getting worse and worse 
in another development two members of inkatha a powerful zulu 
political group were sentenced wednesday to hang for the murders of 
seven teenagers in 1987 one of the worst incidents during a 
twoyear power struggle in natal province 
emmanuel khanyile 34 and wilfred phewa 31 were convicted and 
sentenced in durban supreme court 
the youths were forced into a minibus on march 16 1987 taken to 
a cemetery then beaten with hammers and stabbed according to 
testimony the killers allegedly suspected the youths were 
supporters of the united democratic front an antiapartheid 
coalition that has been feuding with inkatha 
also thursday a bomb exploded in a moving police van slightly 
injuring two white officers and a schoolboy walking nearby police 
said there was no claim of responsibility 
more than 40 civil rights lawyers pledged to fast 48 hours until 
noon saturday in support of the hunger strikers demands to be freed 
or tried 
the lawyers said seven detainees had been hospitalized after 
going 18 days without food 
law and order minister adriaan vlok rejected a request by some of 
the lawyers to meet them thursday at johannesburgs diepkloof 
prison where the strike began jan 23 
he said the government cannot allow itself to be blackmailed by 
way of hunger strikes 
vlok indicated the government might reevaluate its stance if 
some of the hunger strikers near death 
we will look at it again when we are standing at the 
crossroads vlok said 
civil rights workers said 105 detainees at st albans prison in 
port elizabeth many of them held since 1986 joined the hunger 
strike monday about 170 detainees at diepkloof are fasting as are 
detainees in the port city of durban and in witbank a mining town 
near pretoria the lawyers said

badly designed fuel filler pipes on 5 million 
ford motor co cars pose a fire danger that already has caused more 
than 200 deaths a lawyerfounded group said thursday 
a ford spokesman said the company is not aware of any hazardous 
condition that would warrant a recall of older models 
officials of the institute for injury reduction told a news 
conference they want the company to spend 250 million to recall and 
fix the fuel tank assemblies on the cars a variety of models made 
since 1965 
institute president benjamin kelly said the hazardous design has 
been the subject of several suits around the country most ending in 
settlements 
ford spokesman jerald terhorst said requiring automakers to 
modify older models to include each improvement in the product would 
mean that innovations and improvements would soon come to a halt 
he said the company has confidence in the safety of its cars 
fuel systems 
david e perry an insitute member from corpus christi texas 
said if ford fails to act the national highway traffic safety 
administration or congress should step in to force a recall 
perry said he has been involved in nine cases involving fires in 
fordmade cars all ending in settlement he said ford has never 
acknowledged liability and has settled on the condition that amounts 
it paid not be disclosed 
he said ford has acknowledged in court documents that 221 people 
have died in crashes involving fuel tank fires in fordmade cars 
since 1965 and the institute believes from 50 to 100 more deaths 
have occurred with about 3000 people injured 
the defect he said is caused by a design that has the fuel tank 
filler pipe rigidly attached to the vehicles fender causing the 
hose to be pulled out in a rearend collision this causes gas and 
highly combustible vapors to escape and be easily ignited by sparks 
and heat generated in a crash perry said 
he said the danger can be avoided by lengthening the pipe 
attaching it to the fuel tank and providing a breakaway device 
so it will detach from the outside panel at a cost of about 50 per 
car 
the institute said the systems was installed in fullsize fords 
mercurys and lincolns built from 1965 to 1985 in some fullsize 
1986 fords and mercurys in 197479 lincoln mark iv and mark v 
models and in some thunderbirds cougars pintos bobcats 
mustangs capris fairmonts zephyrs and granadas built from 1970 to 
1981 
the institute which describes itself as a nonprofit research 
and educational organization concerned with reducing injuries 
resulting from product defects estimated that 20 million cars were 
built with the fuel tank design and that 5 million of them are still 
on the road

gov william a oneill and more than 100 
judges gathered thursday to honor richard c noren the superior 
court judge who killed himself after withdrawing his bid for a 
second term on the bench 
noren was eulogized as a renaissance man a good judge and a 
considerate friend who spent his last hours writing thankyou notes 
to those who had supported him in his highly public battle for 
reappointment 
noren 47 withdrew from consideration for a second eightyear 
term last week after appearing twice before the general assemblys 
judiciary committee which questioned him about his 1986 drunken 
driving arrest his drinking habits and his truthfulness 
three days later he poisoned himself with car exhaust fumes in a 
barn near the woodstock farmhouse in rural northeast connecticut 
where he had lived since his youth 
a crowd of about 900 including more than 100 judges and scores 
of attorneys and court officials applauded when harry s gaucher 
jr a friend and attorney began his eulogy by saying richard 
carl noren was a good judge 
noren had requested such a eulogy in his emotional second 
appearance before the judiciary committee saying i have often 
said not entirely facetiously that i should like to have on my 
tombstone the epitaph he was a good judge 
the state supreme court and appellate court canceled sessions so 
judges could attend the service at a conference center and most of 
the states 139 superior court judges also cleared their schedules 
to attend 
dick was as close to portraying the renaissance man as anyone i 
have known said norens college roommate henry greene now a 
district of columbia superior court judge he was a historian a 
raconteur an antiques expert 
noren a graduate of harvard college and george washington 
university law school was clerk of superior court in windham from 
1971 to 1980 before being named a judge his first term would have 
expired friday 
there was a sentiment among many of those in attendance that 
norens death reflected the amount of stress judges feel from the 
states reappointment process said chief court administrator aaron 
ment 
whats happened is that we now have a procedure that is similar 
to trying to negotiate a minefield said ment some judges feel 
that the integrity of the system the independence of the 
judiciary is being eroded

the state departments top terrorism expert 
said thursday that officials were wrong to post notices of threats 
against american flights on embassy bulletin boards without also 
telling the traveling public 
the posted notice relayed rumors of a threat against pan am 
flights from frankfort west germany to the united states and 
appeared days before a bomb exploded on pan am flight 103 over 
scotland dec 21 all 259 people on board were killed the threat 
was later determined to be a hoax 
it is not our policy to alert government officials and not the 
general public to such a threat l paul bremer the state 
departments ambassadoratlarge for counterterrorism told the 
house foreign affairs committee there is and can be no double 
standard 
bremer appearing at the second congressional hearing of the day 
on efforts to tighten aviation security called the threat to 
frankfurtus flights a gruesome coincidence 
the notice should not have been posted he said officials 
have acknowledged that the warning was posted in the moscow embassy 
and possibly other missions as well 
bremer said officials at the moscow embassy have said they found 
the policy on warnings not as clear as we thought it was he 
said if a threat is specific and serious authorities recommend 
cancellation of the flight otherwise a public travel advisory is 
issued 
relatives of people killed in the unsolved explosion told the 
earlier hearing that congress should speed federal efforts to 
tighten security against terrorist airplane attacks 
federal aviation and antiterrorism officials defended the 
governments policy of not publicizing bomb threats against 
airlines saying us airlines and airports receive an average of 
three threats a day 
relatives of those killed in the pan am crash said the government 
must do more in notifying passengers about terrorist threats and in 
installing sophisticated equipment to detect explosives and weapons 
i bring no particular expertise to this committee other than 
possibly sadness grief and tears said a steadyvoiced robert p 
berrell an automobile dealer from fargo nd whose 20yearold 
son steven a student at syracuse university was among those 
killed in the crash 
an additional 11 victims were killed in lockerbie scotland when 
flaming debris from the boeing 747 plummeted to earth 
when threats as specific as this are received interested 
passengers must be notified berrell told members of the house 
science space and technologys transportation subcommittee

solidarity founder lech walesa interceded 
to end a strike at polands largest power complex thursday and asked 
restive workers to give his negotiations with the government a 
chance 
at a rally in a roman catholic church for employees of the huge 
nova huta steel mill walesa spent more than an hour explaining the 
talks with communist authorities through which solidarity hopes to 
become legal again 
he urged workers to put aside local grievances long enough for 
the negotiations which began monday in warsaw to bear fruit 
strikes crippled the nova huta mill last spring and summer 
a strike of coal miners at the belchatow power complex 90 miles 
southwest of warsaw which supplies onefifth of polands 
electricity was ended with the help of a mediator sent by walesa 
but other labor tension continued 
the solidarity information service said workers in the nowa huta 
coke department were refusing overtime and the official news agency 
pap said the same was true of ambulance staffs in poznan province 
western poland 
pap said about 460 workers at a machine plant near czestochowa 
started a strike thursday for higher pay cuts in administrative 
staff and better working conditions 
government delegates and representatives of the opposition met 
for seven hours thursday in a working group on trade union issues 
and expressed optimism that technical details for restoring 
solidaritys legal status could be worked out 
among major questions remaining are whether a social contract 
can be made on economic and political reforms and the form of new 
parliamentary elections authorities have made agreement on those 
topics being negotiated by other working groups a condition for 
legalizing the union 
janusz onyszkiewicz national spokesman for solidarity told 
reporters the union wants a separate law making it legal again and 
expressed satisfaction with the prospects 
its not formal approval so far but its optimistic 
because the authorities asked for technical details he said so 
they treat our position as a serious thing and will consider it as 
such 
alexander kwasniewski a government minister who took part in the 
meeting said the discussion now revolves around how the 
legalization would occur 
walesa founded solidarity in gdansk where he still works as a 
shipyard electrician during the labor turmoil of 1980 and the 
government initially accepted it as the first independent trade 
union in the soviet bloc it was suppressed after the declaration of 
martial law in december 1981 however and later outlawed 
after attending the first part of thursdays negotiations in 
warsaw walesa left for the evening mass and rally in nowa huta on 
the outskirts of krakow in southern poland 
he is making a twoday tour of the southern region to reassure 
skeptical workers about the negotiations with the government 
speaking to a crowd of about 3000 people after mass in the 
mistrzejowice church which was lined with solidarity banners he 
declared 
i dont believe in the government but there is a possiblity 
for pluralism as lech walesa i must do everything or take every 
opportunity peacefully to build a better poland 
the union leader who won the 1983 nobel peace prize has 
apologized to audiences lately for too elegant by wearing a suit 
and tie to the negotiations he appeared at the rally in a sportcoat 
and jeans 
when members of the audience shouted out grievances against the 
steel mill management and behavior of local authorities walesa 
appeared impatient 
each one of us has grievances and reasons to strike and we 
have to get out of this he said if there is a chance at the 
round table we have to take it 
solidarity can address specific problems when it is allowed to 
function legally he said 
walesas initial appeal in an interview with state radio was 
broadcast as the working group on unions began its meeting 
he called the belchatow strike another proof that we should 
reach agreement on the most important things as soon as possible and 
restore the organization called solidarity 
wildcat strikes could be avoided if an organized union spoke for 
the workers he said and told solidaritys supporters lech 
walesa is appealing for a chance for the round table we have been 
waiting for so many years we can wait a few days more 
the unprecedented talks first proposed during severe labor 
unrest in august and expected to last up to six weeks are intended 
to create a national consensus for solving polands severe economic 
social and political problems

the state department announced thursday that 
10000 extra visas will be issued in both 1990 and 1991 to 
immigrants from 162 countries on a random basis 
eligible for the lottery are citizens of the soviet union poland 
and several other countries whose refugee quotas are filled the 
application period is march 1 through march 31 unlike the last such 
lottery in 1986 the visas will not be issued on a firstcome 
firstserve basis 
instead the applications will be fed to computers and the 
selections made on a random basis immigrants from all the eligible 
countries will have an equal chance 
unlike refugees who are generally given haven for political 
reasons immigrants are required to have close relatives in the 
united states or have a scarce profession however the 20000 to be 
admitted under the special program will not have to meet those 
requirements 
only screening for mental or criminal liabilities will be 
conducted us officials said 
the only countries excluded are those that used more than 5000 
immigrant slots in fiscal 1988 these are china colombia dominican 
republic el salvador guyana haiti india jamaica south korea 
mexico the philippines and the united kingdom 
the excluded include taiwan and also natives of anguilla 
bermuda british virgin islands cayman islands falkland islands 
gibraltar hong kong monteserrat pitcairn st helena turks and 
caicos islands 
a lottery for 10000 visas was held in 1986 about 14 million 
applicants lost out 
the state department announcement contained strict rules for 
applicants among them is that all applications must be typewritten 
and that husbands and wives may apply separately 
last month in a move to admit more soviet and east european 
refugees former president reagan decided to increase this fiscal 
years quota by 7000 by lowering the quota of vietnamese refugees 
many of whom are former political prisoners 
the decision brought to 25000 the number of soviets who will be 
permitted to enter the united states while the added slots will be 
taken mostly from the quota for refugees from vietnam us 
officials stressed the president has considerable flexibility to 
alter the totals later on 
thousands of soviet refugees many of them jews are in vienna 
and rome waiting for permission to come to the united states and 
the quota for them to enter this country is full 
the lottery announced thursday will give them a chance to enter 
the country as immigrants but the chance will be no greater than 
that of applicants from the 161 other countries that are eligible

the government on thursday 
outlawed west germanys most notorious neonazi organization and 
police discovered a small cache of weapons and nazi propaganda in a 
search of the party headquarters 
during coordinated raids across the country police confiscated 
knives guns ammunition posters of adolf hitler and 
swastikacovered banners from members of the nationale sammlung 
the federal republic is not about to become the roaming grounds 
for rightwing extremists interior minister friedrich zimmermann 
said in announcing the ban 
the groups leader neonazi michael kuehnen said he was 
considering legal action to fight the ban 
founded last summer the nationale sammlung had fielded 
candidates for next months elections in frankfurt and suburban 
langen and said it hoped to run in other locations as well its 
platform included renaming a railway station after hitler 
the ban forbids nationale sammlung members from carrying out any 
activities as a group including fielding candidates for an 
election and it bans them from using the name publicly 
it coincides with a growing concern in west germany of a possible 
resurgence of ultrarightist tendencies 
late thursday the zdf television network quoted guenther 
schleicher head of the hesse state office for the protection of the 
constitution as alleging that cases of murder and bank robberies 
have been linked to neonazi parties in west germany 
schleicher also estimated about 2000 neonazis are in west 
germany although other officials have put the figure closer to 
1500 
germany theyre coming stern magazine said in a headline on 
this weeks cover another headline sarcastically referred to the 
extremists as the nice nazis from next door 
a poll published sunday by the welt am sonntag newspaper said 
another extreme rightwing group the republican party would win 
115 percent of the vote nationwide if federal elections were held 
now 
the republicans headed by a former nazi waffen ss soldier 
captured 75 percent of the vote in last months elections in west 
berlin that sends 11 party members to the local legislature and 
gives the republicans two seats in parliament beginning next year 
further to the right of the republican party are the neonazis 
who are split into about 10 different groups the most notorious is 
nationale sammlung which has about 170 members 
the interior ministry said nationale sammlung had expressed 
revolutionary and combative aims to change west german society it 
also accused kuehnen and his followers of building up neonazi 
groups nationwide 
the organization supports expulsion from west germany of foreign 
workers and asylum seekers 
kuehnen has also been active with rightwing extremists from 
several countries in planning celebrations for the 100th anniversary 
of hitlers birth april 20 
contacted in munich kuenhen said in an interview he would fight 
the ban in court i see certain legal possibilities said 
kuehnen who has served three prison terms for nazi activities 
west germanys ard tv network showed police carrying knives guns 
and a box filled with ammunition from kuehnens frankfurt home 
which serves as the partys headquarters kuehnen was not home 
during the raid 
the broadcast showed police in a workshop of the house where 
kuehnen and his supporters allegedly filed down bullets so they 
would cause more severe injuries 
gottfried milde the interior minister of the state of hesse 
said most of the raids were in hesse which includes frankfurt 
the other states where police staged raids included bavaria and 
north rhinewestphalia the federal interior ministry said 
searches there turned up an air rifle two steel helmets a gas 
mask three pistols for firing blanks and nazi propaganda 
zimmermann said authorities were seizing any property they could 
find that belonged to the ns group whose initials are identical to 
the bestknown german abbreviation for hitlers nazi party 
the nazi party has been banned since west germany was founded in 
1949 
under west german law the interior ministry may ban any 
organization it determines is spreading nazi propaganda violations 
of the ban carry penalties of up to five years in prison 
there have been calls for the ministry to ban another neonazi 
group the free german workers party which the interior ministry 
says has about 500 members the party is under investigation in 
connection with arson attacks on foreign workers in west germany

police said they arrested two of 
deposed president alfredo stroessners government ministers thursday 
and caught the former central bank president trying to flee with a 
large amount of cash 
no charges were specified but the detentions appeared to be 
connected with alleged financial irregularities under gen 
stroessner who ruled for nearly 35 years and was overthrown last 
week stroessner is in exile in brazil 
cesar romeo acosta 75yearold former head of the central bank 
was arrested while trying cross the border to argentina and confined 
to a police hospital the authorities reported they said said he 
was carrying 20000 many travelers checks and 12000 west german 
marks 
police also reported the detentions of adan godoy gimenez former 
minister of public health and carlos ortiz ramirez who was 
stroessners education minister 
officials in the provisional government of gen andres rodriguez 
a longtime associate of stroessner who ousted him feb 3 have been 
saying all week that officials of the former regime apparently 
enriched themselves with public funds 
central bank officials said wednesday they would examine checks 
written by some government officials who are no longer government 
officials 
with the dictator gone exiles are returning from neighboring 
brazil and argentina and such opposition politicians as domingo 
laino are interviewed on television 
rodriguez who has called elections for may 1 is receiving 
dissident factions of the ruling colorado party 
it seems like a dream to see laino on television said 
journalist fernando cazenave it seems like a fantasy to hear 
leaders of the popular colorado movement were received by the 
president of the republic all this has never happened in this 
country 
leaders of the dissident popular colorado movement including 
miguel angel gonzalez casabianca and mario mallorquin were exiled 
in 1960 after they were allowed back in 1983 police agents on 
motorscooters followed them everywhere 
opposition leaders hardly ever appeared on television while 
stroessner was in power the generals son gustavo owned one of the 
two stations in asuncion and his good friend nicolas bo owned the 
other 
stroessner closed the largest newspaper abc color in march 1984 
and called publisher aldo zuccolillo an enemy of the government 
soon after the coup zuccolillo was featured in a story in the the 
colorado party paper 
critics say only the faces have changed and the system of 
colorado party rule under a military president remains the same but 
rodriguez has appointed a capable cabinet set an election date and 
made overtures to the roman catholic church which stroessner 
alienated 
us ambassador timothy towell spent an hour thursday with 
foreign minister luis maria argana then told reporters weve 
heard the words we hear the commitments now is the time to see how 
they implement them 
we will be judging the quality of our relationship on the 
degree in which they move forward in all these areas

they have no place of their own to eat or sleep to take a bath 
or wash their clothes their children have no place to study or play 
no these are not just derelicts or neerdowells or social 
misfits they represent many families of the working poor who have 
lowpaying jobs and work each day but simply cannot pay for the 
inflated price of housing 
america can do better than that we must do better 
of course we cannot expect to vanquish all these evils 
immediately but if we have the will we can make significant 
progress against all three deficits this year 
we in the congress and surely all americans everywhere are 
anxious to help our new president fulfill his promise of a kinder 
gentler america i want very much to help george bush qualify to 
be known as the education president 
we in congress are eager to help him attain the goals he has 
expressed of wider access for all americans to head start services 
to safe and wholesome child day care in an age when both parents 
must work to affordable housing and to a cleaner environment 
by working hard together we must drive the scourge of drugs from 
our streets and our schools as mr bush pledged in his inaugural 
speech congress made significant progress last year in this truly 
bipartisan goal we developed a good battle plan for the war against 
drugs but when it came to paying for the war the government ran 
out of money right now were financing not a war but a skirmish 
thats not good enough our society can afford to pay for 
vigorous antidrug efforts truth is we cant afford not to thats 
our first line of defense 
that and the education of our children more vital to our 
national security than star wars 
since 1980 the federal investment in education has actually 
declined by 12 percent is it any wonder that american students 
better fed and surely just as smart do worse in mathematics and 
language and geography and science than students do in most other 
industrial nations 
thats not good enough we can do better than that and we will

president bush in his maiden policy initiative 
to congress on thursday proposed a 116 trillion common sense 
budget for fiscal 1990 that calls for less military but greater 
domestic spending than sought by president reagan 
the plan which features a oneyear freeze on scores of federal 
programs calls for roughly 5 billion more spending than the budget 
submitted by former president reagan last month and carries out 
bushs oftstated opposition to new taxes 
higher taxes are not the solution to the deficit problem 
bushs 193page budget outline declares 
but while the measure supports many of the campaign vows made by 
bush in his 1988 presidential campaign more help for the homeless 
for education for child care and for cleaning up the environment 
it also leaves much of the federal budget up to negotiation with 
congress 
initial reaction from lawmakers was cordial 
the democratic congress wants to work with this president in 
every way that we can house speaker jim wright said in a taped 
response for the television networks 
well give him our sincere cooperation that does not mean 
obedience it does mean our honest help and our very best advice 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush was happy with 
the budget and eager to get on with the bush initiatives 
bushs first presidential speech televised nationally at 9 pm 
est was expected to mix campaign promises with expressions of 
budget restraint and new overtures toward bipartisanship 
but his budget was vague on exactly where all the money would 
come from to pay for initiatives 
it is not as much as he promised but it is a start bushs 
budget director richard g darman told a white house briefing 
the budget director said that there was room for even more 
savings in federal spending if congress decided to go along with the 
dozens of programs that reagan sought to terminate actions that 
for the most part the new bush budget does not embrace 
the new budget did not detail which programs should be cut beyond 
the general proposal for a spending freeze 
bush is ready to negotiate with congress on a final budget all 
day and all night if thats what it takes darman said 
his budget described as a commonsense approach to 
budgeting calls for a oneyear freeze on defense spending at the 
levels of inflation 
and it projects a federal deficit in the fiscal year that begins 
next oct 1 of 948 billion well within the 100 billion limit 
set by the grammrudman budgetbalancing law if the sale of 
government assets are included the deficit would be even lower 
911 billon bushs budget amendments call for an overall budget 
surplus of 38 billion by 1993 
the plan seeks to put in motion a variety of campaign promises 
including a proposed 1000per child tax credit for lowincome 
families a 3000 tax deduction to help cover the costs of 
adoptions an expansion of the head start program and a new plan to 
give grants to the nations best high schools 
it would also provide nearly 1 billion more in the upcoming year 
to fight the scourge of drugs and would restore some 17 
billion in cuts sought by reagan in the medicaid program for medical 
assistance for poor people 
bushs proposal would also reduce to 15 percent from the current 
level of 28 percent to 33 percent the tax on most capital gains 
the profits from the sale of real estate stocks or other assets 
this proposal had drawn opposition in advance from congressional 
democrats who vowed to fight it as a tax benefiting mostly the rich 
and there are other strains in bushs efforts to extend an 
offered hand to congress his speech comes as the senate armed 
services committee is engaged in a protracted and divisive 
confirmation struggle over bushs nomination of former sen john 
tower as defense secretary 
bush has said he stands firmly behind his nominee despite 
recurring allegations of womanizing and excessive drinking that 
continue to stall the confirmation process 
the budget plan presented few surprises most of its elements had 
been reported in the past 
bush repeated reagans longsought appeal for a constitutional 
amendment to balance the budget and authority to veto individual 
lines in spending bills 
bush who promised a kinder but gentler nation in his 
campaign also proposed an overall increase of 70 percent in federal 
spending on the tragedy of men women and children living without 
homes 
much of the revenues needed to fund bushs new initiatives would 
come from spending freezes on a host of federal programs including 
all government military and civilian retirement benefits 
however social security benefits would not be affected under the 
plan 
the president claims his capital gains proposal would generate 4 
billion or so in revenue by stimulating new business investment but 
many economists have disputed this and the proposal has already 
encountered stiff demcoratic opposition 
in fact rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house 
ways and means committee on thursday promised allout opposition to 
bushs proposal to reduce the capital gains tax 
even so democratic leaders generally seemed ready to give bush 
the benefit of the doubt in his first speech to a joint session of 
congress 
i dont think theres any particular effort on the part of the 
democratic party to do anything expect to applaud what the president 
is about to say and to continue the kind of spirit that the 
president has been working very hard on in trying to develop a 
relationship with congress said rep dante fascell dfla 
under regular procedures the presidents budget gets modified by 
the house and the senate into a final budget resolution which then 
serves as an overall guide for legislation produced later by the 
appropriations and taxwriting committees 
bushs plan modifies a 115 trillion budget reagan submitted 
shortly before leaving office the reagan plan called for a 2 
percent increase in defense spending over inflation proposed scores 
of cuts in domestic programs and projected a federal deficit of 
925 billion

working together congress will pass a clean air bill this year to 
protect that precious commodity upon which all human life depends 
a kinder gentler america thats old time democratic religion 
we embrace it enthusiastically 
we know and you know that these goals cannot be achieved by 
words alone or by symbolic gestures they require money the 
commitment of resources sufficient to win the battle against these 
common enemies 
on the question of how these vital initiatives will be paid for 
the democrats in congress will insist on fairness 
we would have to reject any kind of flexible freeze that 
would bend with flexibility for the rich and powerful but freeze out 
the middle income families of america 
we will oppose attempts to cut medicare 
we are ready to meet with president bush any time he wishes and 
seek common solutions our house budget committee will begin its 
formal hearings in a very few days the presidents representatives 
are invited we are determined to complete our work on time and 
pass our appropriations bills on time again this year as we did 
last year 
we do have limited resources and urgent challenges but there are 
some things we can do without spending public money 
we must raise the minimum wage held down for eight long years 
because those who work honestly for wages in america must never 
receive less than they would on welfare 
we can ask that polluters pay more of the cost of cleaning up the 
poisons which they create and from which they profit 
we must encourage american corporations to reinvest in america 
in plants and factories and jobs and strength not in leveraged 
buyouts and paper profits 
we should require that corporations insure the health of their 
employees so that the hard earned family savings of a decade or 
more cannot be wiped out by the illness of a single child 
when it comes to shaping a kinder gentler fairer nation the 
real question is not whether we have the words but whether we have 
the will for ultimately we will be judged by what we have done 
in the years ahead long after this night is forgotten and the 
phrases have faded and our page of history has turned let it be 
said of us that we have refreshed americas sense of common concern 
that we renewed americas basic strength that together we reached 
out for americas future and put our faith and our investment in the 
american people 
in our earnest efforts to help the new president build this 
future the house and senate will work together the senate 
democratic majority is represented tonight by the chairman of the 
senate finance committee our recent nominee for vice president of 
the united states senator lloyd bentsen

a federal appeals court denied a justice 
department attempt thursday to stop oliver norths irancontra trial 
on nationalsecurity grounds but the bush administration vowed to 
continue trying to put the proceeding on hold 
possible airing of state secrets as the former national security 
council aide defends himself has threatened all along to scuttle 
the trial two major charges against north were dropped last month 
for that reason 
assistant attorney general edward sg dennis said the risk to 
national security would be significant under current rules laid 
down by the trial judge he said the government would lack control 
over disclosure of very sensitive classified information 
it would be a complete crapshoot dennis said 
he said the government could seek reconsideration of the ruling 
by the appeals court or go directly to the supreme court 
dennis who heads the justice departments criminal division 
spoke with reporters after the us circuit court of appeals refused 
to block the trials start 
on thursday night the department said it will ask the three 
judges on the appeals court panel to reconsider its decision friday 
morning 
they had before them a lot more material from independent 
counsel lawrence walsh than they had from us said department 
spokesman loye miller walsh said the department doesnt have the 
authority to intervene in such a fashion and he opposes the justice 
departments attempt to block the trial 
miller also said the appeals court had before it the order from 
the north case trial judge who earlier in the day rejected the 
justice departments request to stop the proceedings 
by the time the appeals court acted us district judge gerhard 
a gesell had already sent the newly picked jury home for the 
weekend with instructions to return ready for swearing in at 930 
am monday 
the governments objections to the procedures adopted by gesell 
must be heard before the trial begins because harmful disclosures 
could come as early as the opening statements dennis said 
in a twosentence order the appeals court dissolved its 
temporary stay of the proceedings saying it was denying the 
departments motion to stop the trial substantially for the 
reasons cited by gesell the judge had ruled that the attorney 
general did not have authority to intervene in the prosecution 
which is being handled by walsh 
two hours earlier not having heard from the appeals court 
gesell had sent the jury home saying he had to close up shop 
until monday because of the government appeal 
what we are going to do is shut down catch up on our sleep 
he said 
the justice department had appealed a gesell ruling that 
department officials could not routinely censor classified 
information before it was presented in court 
gesell ruled that the attorney generals only authority to enter 
the case at this stage is to take the drastic step of affirming in 
an affidavit that disclosure of certain classified information would 
damage national security 
under that provision the court would be required to order north 
not to make the disclosure 
but dennis said we think thats premature we could file such 
an affidavit when there is specific information thats at issue 
earlier thursday the jury was selected with lawyers from each 
side eliminating prospective jurors from a panel of 45 without 
stating a reason all of the people on the panel had said in open 
court they had read heard or seen little or nothing of norths 
testimony before two congressional committees in the summer of 1987 
nine of the 12 criminal charges lodged against north focus on 
accusations that he concealed from congress and former attorney 
general edwin meese iii his efforts on behalf of the contras 
fighting the leftist government of nicaragua 
north also is accused of illegally accepting installation of a 
security system at his home converting to his own use at least 
4300 in travelers checks from a contra leader and conspiring to 
illegally use a taxexempt foundation to raise money for the rebels 
gesell said he would not swear in the jury until the appeals 
court ruled the rule of double jeopardy which protects north from 
being tried twice on the same charges comes into play once a jury 
is sworn 
the allblack jury is typical of the district of columbia 
community which is heavily involved in federal government affairs 
and which is racially about 75 percent black 
the justice department said in requesting thursdays stay 
because of the national security equities involved and the 
highly sensitive classified information that may be compromised if 
this case is permitted to proceed to trial without correction of the 
procedures that the district court proposes to employ it is 
imperative that the trial be suspended pending the outcome of the 
pending appeal 
gesell called the departments attempt at intervention 
frivolous 
walsh the independent counsel who brought the case against 
north told the appeals court that the justice department had no 
right to intervene that such authority rested with the independent 
counsel

a new presidents first budget is always a 
collision between campaign rhetoric and reality and the budget 
george bush put forward thursday could spell a quick end to his 
honeymoon with congress 
bush the campaigner wanted to be the education president stop 
the drug scourge house the homeless and clean up the environment 
and he promised that all the good things he wanted for the 
american people could be accomplished without raising taxes 
the critics charged that bush would fail either the promises 
would go unfulfilled or the president would end up increasing taxes 
but in a melody with a familiar refrain bush came up up with a 
way out of his quandary he said he will raise more revenue by 
cutting taxes strains of that old black magic by ronald reagan 
the tax bush has in mind is the capital gains levy which taxes 
the profits earned from the sale of assets such as stocks 
the bush budget projects a 5 billion increase in revenues for 
the 1990 fiscal year which begins next oct 1 through enactment of 
the cut in the capital gains tax 
bushs capital gains tax helps the new president achieve a 
projected 1990 deficit of 911 billion slightly bettering the 
925 billion deficit reagan put forward one month ago in his final 
spending blueprint 
that is accomplished through the 5 billion projected revenue 
gain from the cut in the capital gains tax and 26 billion in 
reductions bush proposed making in reagans 1990 military spending 
request 
currently the profits on sales of assets are counted just like 
other income which means for highincome people a top tax rate of 
either 28 percent or 33 percent 
bush wants to cut the capital gains rate in 1990 to 15 percent 
for assets held one year or longer and projects the change would 
increase revenues by 5 billion as people sold assets to take 
advantage of the lower rate 
but that revenue estimate comes with a big catch many economists 
believe it will lower government revenues for other years 
david wyss an economist with data resources inc a lexington 
mass economic consulting firm said that much of the revenue would 
be lost in the current year thus ballooning the size of the 1989 
deficit which is already projected to soar to 161 billion 
i guarantee that you would lose about the same amount of 
revenue in 1989 that you will gain in 1990 wyss said if you 
know that the capital gains rate is going down on jan 1 you wont 
be selling a lot of stock at a profit in june 
democrats on capitol hill have another complaint they say the 
capital gains tax cut which was one of bushs campaign promises is 
nothing but the old republican trickle down theory to benefit 
the rich they contend that 85 percent of all capital gains are 
earned by the wealthiest 5 percent of americans 
they aimed their fire at the proposal in barbed remarks stripped 
of the bipartisan good feeling which surrounded bushs inaugural 
address 
senate budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn said that 
at a time of huge budget deficits it was simply unacceptable to be 
considering tax breaks for the very wealthiest segment of the 
american population 
the capital gains tax wasnt the only target drawing fire 
critics complained that in many other areas the amount of money bush 
is proposing to spend is minuscule when compared with the magnitude 
of the problem 
even before bushs joint address his aides were busy lowering 
expectations contending that in a time of tight budgets it was 
tough to fund new initiatives 
bushs budget director richard darman told reporters at a 
briefing on the budget that the president had at least made a start 
toward fulfulling his pledge for a kinder gentler nation 
is it as kind and gentle as everyone would like to be 
immediately i think probably not but we cant do absolutely 
everything at once darman told reporters we will not be 
claiming to have solved all problems 
during the campaign bush said the deficit problem would simply 
melt by 1993 or 1994 if congress would enact his flexible 
freeze whereby the overall rise in government spending is held to 
the increase in inflation each year some programs could climb 
faster than the inflation rate but only if other areas were pruned 
back 
but the pruning is likely to be as difficult for bush as it was 
for reagan 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas said 
thursday he was upset that bush had decided to leave in his budget a 
proposal also in reagans final budget to curb medicare spending by 
5 billion next year by trimming payments to doctors and hospitals 
such a cut bentsen said leads to very serious problems 
because you have a lot of hospitals losing money on medicare now and 
a lot of hospitals closing particularly rural hospitals

next year alone thanks to economic growth without any change in 
the law the federal government will take in over 80 billion more 
than it does this year thats right over 80 billion in new 
revenues with no increase in taxes our job is to allocate those 
new resources wisely 
we can afford to increase spending by a modest amount but 
enough to invest in key priorities and still cut the deficit by 
almost 40 percent in one year that will allow us to meet the 
targets set forth in the grammrudmanhollings law 
but to do that we must recognize that growth above inflation in 
federal programs is not preordained that not all spending 
initiatives were designed to be immortal 
i make this pledge tonight my team and i are ready to work with 
the congress to form a special leadership group to negotiate in 
good faith to work day and night if thats what it takes to 
meet the budget targets and to produce a budget on time 
we cannot settle for business as usual government by continuing 
resolution or government by crisis will not do 
i ask the congress tonight to approve several measures which will 
make budgeting more sensible we could save time and improve 
efficiency by enacting twoyear budgets fortythree governors have 
the lineitem veto presidents should have it too 
at the very least when a president proposes to rescind federal 
spending the congress should be required to vote on that proposal 
instead of killing it by inaction 
and i ask for congress to honor the publics wishes by passing a 
constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget such an 
amendment once phased in will discipline both congress and the 
executive branch 
several principles describe the kind of america i hope to build 
with your help in the years ahead 
we will not have the luxury of taking the easy spendthrift 
approach to solving problems because higher spending and higher 
taxes put economic growth at risk 
economic growth provides jobs and hope economic growth enables 
us to pay for social programs economic growth enhances the security 
of the nation and low tax rates create economic growth 
i believe in giving americans greater freedom and greater choice 
and i will work for choice for american families whether in the 
housing in which they live the schools to which they send their 
children or the child care they select for their young 
i believe that we have an obligation to those in need but that 
government should not be the provider for first resort for things 
that the private sector can produce better 
i believe in a society that is free from discrimination and 
bigotry of any kind i will work to knock down the barriers left by 
past discrimination and to build a more tolerant society that will 
stop such barriers from ever being built again 
i believe that family and faith represent the moral compass of 
the nation and i will work to make them strong for as benjamin 
franklin said if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his 
notice can a great nation rise without his aid 
and i believe in giving people the power to make their own lives 
better through growth and opportunity together lets put power in 
the hands of people

three weeks ago we celebrated the bicentennial inaugural the 
200th anniversary of the first presidency and if you look back one 
thing is so striking about the way the founding fathers looked at 
america they didnt talk about themselves they talked about 
posterity they talked about the future 
we too must think in terms bigger than ourselves 
we must take actions today that will ensure a better tomorrow we 
must extend american leadership in technology increase longterm 
investment improve our educational system and boost productivity 
these are the keys to building a better future 
here are some of my recommendations 
i propose almost 22 billion for the national science 
foundation to promote basic research 
i propose to make permanent the tax credit for research and 
development 
i have asked vice president quayle to chair a new task force on 
competitiveness 
i request funding for nasa and a strong space program an 
increase of almost 24 billion over the current fiscal year we 
must have a manned space station a vigorous safe space shuttle 
program and more commercial development in space the space program 
should always go full throttle up thats not just our 
ambition its our destiny 
i propose that we cut the maximum tax rate on capital gains to 
increase longterm investment history is clear this will increase 
revenues help savings and create new jobs 
we wont be competitive if we leave whole sectors of america 
behind this is the year we should finally enact urban enterprise 
zones and bring hope to our inner cities 
but the most important competitiveness program of all is one 
which improves education in america when some of our students 
actually have trouble locating america on a map of the world it is 
time for us to map a new approach to education 
we must reward excellence and cut through bureaucracy we must 
help those schools that need help most we must give choice to 
parents students teachers and principals and we must hold all 
concerned accountable in education we cannot tolerate mediocrity 
i want to cut the dropout rate and make america a more literate 
nation because what it really comes down to is this the longer our 
graduation lines are today the shorter our unemployment lines will 
be tomorrow 
so tonight i am proposing the following initiatives 
the beginning of a 500 million program to reward americas best 
schools merit schools 
the creation of special presidential awards for the best 
teachers in every state because excellence should be rewarded 
the establishment of a new program of national science scholars 
one each year for every member of the house and senate to give this 
generation of students a special incentive to excel in science and 
mathematics 
the expanded use of magnet schools which give families and 
students greater choice 
and a new program to encourage alternative certification 
which will let talented people from all fields teach in the 
classroom

supplies are so short in veterans 
administration hospitals that nurses are scrounging thee little 
souvenir bars of soap and shampoo bottles from hotels to bring to va 
patients a nurse told congress on thursday 
supply accounts are frequently raided to pay salaries and avoid 
layoffs an outside medical administrator told the house veterans 
affairs committee 
claudette morissey a nurse at the brooklyn ny veterans 
hospital and prsident of the nurses organization of the veterans 
administration said in testimony submitted to the hearing at one 
va hospital in the south nurses were frustrated by the refusal of 
the prosthetics department to supply wheel chair cushions for 
patients on the long term care unit 
the nurses obtained a 25 donation went to the local 
upholstery store and purchased a large foam mattress and with an 
electric knife borrowed from the mother of one of the nurses cut 
the foam to make wheel chair cushions for their patients 
she did not identify the hospital nor the hospital in other 
anecdotes 
nurses in one hospital brought in souvenir hotel soaps and 
shampoos for the patients and in another brought and cut large 
bars of soap in small pieces for patients to use 
at her own hospital she said we cannot properly monitor 
diabetic patients when there are no lancets to do finger sticks no 
chem sticks for blood samples and no insulin syringes to use to give 
insulin if it is needed this is the situation i have faced over the 
past month at my facility and i thank god there has been no crisis 
because of it 
donald r smith va spokesman said he could not address 
allegations made at specific facilities in the va system of 172 
hospitals and more than 220 outpatient clinics 
where we have specific allegations we would defer to the local 
hospital for comment said smith i wouldnt want to speak to 
the allegations of one nurse or one who represents a group of nurses 
as something that exists throughout the system 
he said however that va directordesignate edward derwinski 
told the committee earlier this week that he would seek more money 
as a supplemental budget for 1989 and in the 1990 budget 
he is aware of problems caused by the budget crunch said 
smith he met with president bush yesterday wednesday and i am 
sure the problems of the hospitals were discussed 
a soviet report last week of hospital patients getting aids from 
unsterilized needles is a startling reminded to us in this country 
that mistakes can happen when the system starts to cut corners and 
workers perform daily under inordinate pressure as we do in the 
va she said 
at congressional hearings last september va officials said they 
faced a 600 million to 1 billion shortfall in their 1054 billion 
budget for medical care in the current fiscal year 
derwinski who will become secretary of veterans affairs when the 
va becomes a cabinet department next month said tuesday he had met 
with budget director richard darman 
declining to say if he thought a supplemental appropriation is 
needed for the current fiscal year derwinski said the meeting with 
darman didnt result in any figure changes but i hope itll 
increase his sensitivity 
l thompson bowles vice president for medical affairs at the 
george washington university medical center a member of a va 
advisory committee and a consulting surgeon to two va hospitals 
said by moving funds from other accounts the department of 
medicine and surgery was able to remain near the congressionally 
mandated 194720 employment level 
kenneth i shine dean of the university of california at los 
angeles medical school told the committee that next years medical 
budget should be 1242 billion a 14 percent or 148 billion 
increase over this years total instead of the 186 million 
increase proposed in president reagans budget four veterans 
organizations have endorsed a similar amount for next year

i have said id like to be the education president tonight 
i ask you to join me by becoming the education congress 
just last week as i settled into this new office i received a 
letter from a mother in pennsylvania who had been struck by my 
message in the inaugural address not 12 hours before she 
wrote my husband and i received word that our son was addicted 
to cocaine he had the world at his feet bright gifted 
personable he could have done anything with his life now he 
has chosen cocaine 
please she wrote find a way to curb the supply of 
cocaine get tough with the pushers our son needs your help 
my friends that voice crying out for help could be the voice of 
your own neighbor your own friend your own son over 23 million 
americans used illegal drugs last year at a staggering cost to our 
nations wellbeing 
let this be recorded as the time when america rose up and said 
no to drugs the scourge of drugs must be stopped i am asking 
tonight for an increase of almost a billion dollars in budget 
outlays to escalate the war against drugs the war will be waged on 
all fronts 
our new drug czar bill bennett and i will be 
shouldertoshoulder leading the charge 
some money will be used to expand treatment to the poor and to 
young mothers this will offer the helping hand to the many innocent 
victims of drugs like the thousands of babies born addicted or 
with aids because of the mothers addiction 
some will be used to cut the waiting time for treatment some 
money will be devoted to those urban schools where the emergency is 
now the worst and much of it will be used to protect our borders 
with help from the coast guard the customs service the departments 
of state and justice and yes the us military 
i mean to get tough on the drug criminals let me be clear this 
president will back up those who put their lives on the line every 
day our local police officers 
my budget asks for beefedup prosecution for a new attack on 
organized crime and for enforcement of tough sentences and for 
the worst kingpins that means the death penalty 
i also want to make sure that when a drug dealer is convicted 
there is a cell waiting for him he should not go free because 
prisons are too full 
let the word go out if you are caught and convicted you will do 
time 
but for all we do in law enforcement in interdiction and 
treatment we will never win this war on drugs unless we stop demand 
for drugs 
so some of this increase will be used to educate the young about 
the dangers of drugs we must involve parents we must involve 
teachers we must involve communities and my friends we must 
involve ourselves 
one problem related to drug use demands our urgent attention and 
our continuing compassion that is the terrible tragedy of aids i 
am asking for 16 billion for education to prevent the disease 
and for research to find a cure

if were to protect our future we need a new attitude about the 
environment we must protect the air we breathe i will send to you 
shortly legislation for a new more effective clean air act it will 
include a plan to reduce by date certain the emissions which cause 
acid rain because the time for study alone has passed and the 
time for action is now 
we must make use of clean coal my budget contains full funding 
on schedule for the clean coal technology agreement we have made 
with canada we intend to honor that agreement 
we must not neglect our parks so i am asking to fund new 
acquisitions under the land and water conservation fund 
we must protect our oceans i support new penalties against those 
who would dump medical waste and other trash in the oceans the age 
of the needle on the beach must end 
in some cases the gulfs and oceans off our shores hold the 
promise of oil and gas reserves which can make our nation more 
secure and less dependent on foreign oil when those with the most 
promise can be tapped safely as with much of the alaska national 
wildlife refuge we should proceed but we must use caution and we 
must respect the environment 
so tonight i am calling for the indefinite postponement of three 
lease sales which have raised troubling questions two off the 
coast of california and one which could threaten the everglades in 
florida action on these three lease sales will await the 
conclusions of a special task force set up to measure the potential 
for environmental damage 
i am directing the attorney general and the administrator of the 
environmental protection agency to use every tool at their disposal 
to speed and toughen the enforcement of our laws against toxic waste 
dumpers i want faster cleanups and tougher enforcement of penalties 
against polluters 
in addition to caring for our future we must care for those 
around us a decent society shows compassion for the young the 
elderly the vulnerable and the poor 
our first obligation is to the most vulnerable infants poor 
mothers children living in poverty and my proposed budget 
recognizes this i ask for full funding of medicaid an increase of 
over 3 billion and an expansion of the program to include 
coverage of pregnant women who are near the poverty line 
i believe we should help working families cope with the burden of 
child care our help should be aimed at those who need it most 
lowincome families with young children i support a new child care 
tax credit that will aim our efforts at exactly those families 
without discriminating against mothers who choose to stay at home 
now i know there are competing proposals but remember this the 
overwhelming majority of all preschool child care is now provided by 
relatives and neighbors churches and community groups families who 
choose these options should remain eligible for help parents should 
have choice 
and for those children who are unwanted or abused or whose 
parents are deceased i believe we should encourage adoption i 
propose to reenact the tax deduction for adoption expenses and to 
double it to 3000 lets make it easier for these kids to have 
parents who love them 
we have a moral contract with our senior citizens in this 
budget social security is fully funded including a full 
costofliving adjustment we must honor our contract

we must care about those in the shadows of life and i like 
many americans am deeply troubled by the plight of the homeless 
the causes of homelessness are many the history is long but the 
moral imperative to act is clear 
thanks to the deep well of generosity in this great land many 
organizations already contribute but we in government cannot stand 
on the sidelines in my budget i ask for greater support for 
emergency food and shelter for health services and measures to 
prevent substance abuse and for clinics for the mentally ill and 
i propose a new initiative involving the full range of government 
agencies we must confront this national shame 
there is another issue i decided to mention here tonight i have 
long believed that the people of puerto rico should have the right 
to determine their own political future personally i favor 
statehood but i ask the congress to take the necessary steps to let 
the people decide in a referendum 
certain problems the result of decades of unwise practices 
threaten the health and security of our people left unattended 
they will only get worse but we can act now to put them behind us 
earlier this week i announced my support for a plan to restore 
the financial and moral integrity of our savings system i ask 
congress to enact our reform proposals within 45 days we must not 
let this situation fester 
certainly the savings of americans must remain secure insured 
depositors will continue to be fully protected but any plan to 
refinance the system must be accompanied by major reform our 
proposals will prevent such a crisis from recurring the best answer 
is to make sure that a mess like this will never happen again 
the majority of thrifts in communities across this nation have 
been honest they have played a major role in helping families 
achieve the american dream of home ownership but make no mistake 
those who are corrupt those who break the law must be kicked out 
of the business and they should go to jail 
we face a massive task in cleaning up the waste left from decades 
of environmental neglect at americas nuclear weapons plants 
clearly we must modernize these plants and operate them safely 
that is not at issue our national security depends on it 
but beyond that we must clean up the old mess thats been left 
behind and i propose in this budget to more than double our 
current effort to do so this will allow us to identify the exact 
nature of the various problems so we can clean them up and clean 
them up we will 
we have been fortunate during these past eight years america is 
a stronger nation today than it was in 1980 morale in our armed 
forces is restored our resolve has been shown our readiness has 
been improved and we are at peace there can no longer be any doubt 
that peace has been made more secure through strength when america 
is stronger the world is safer 
most people dont realize that after the successful restoration 
of our strength the pentaon budget has actually been reduced in 
real terms for each of the last four years we cannot tolerate 
further reductions 
in light of the compelling need to reduce the deficit however i 
support a oneyear freeze in the military budget something i 
proposed last fall in my flexible freeze plan 
this freeze will apply for only one year after that increases 
above inflation will be required i will not sacrifice american 
preparedness and i will not compromise american strength

president bush called on lawmakers thursday 
night to reform farm payment programs by reducing them by 2 
billion next fiscal year and the democratic chairmen of both 
agriculture committees quickly said he was cutting too hard 
bushs overall fiscal blueprint for department of agriculture 
programs appeared similar to what an outgoing president reagan 
proposed a month ago but some lawmakers expressed puzzlement over 
the fine print 
rep virginia smith rneb said the spending assumptions on 
which bush based his outline were at sharp odds with reagans and 
that we will have much negotiating to do with the 
administration she said farmers facing more drought could not 
take deeper cuts 
ultimately mother nature and the us congress will have the 
last word the appropriations committee lawmaker said 
reagan also had proposed 2 billion in cuts in payments by the 
governmentowned commodity credit corp next year but he sought to 
soften the blow for farmers by making 900 million of those payments 
this fiscal year 
the commodity credit corp provides incomesupport payments to 
cotton rice wheat and feed grains producers as well as 
pricesupport loans that guard farmers against market slumps by 
making the government the buyer of last resort 
farm payments ballooned to more than 26 billion in 1986 but 
currently are costing taxpayers less than half of that as the farm 
economy continues to rebound from its doldrums of the early and 
mid1980s 
bushs budget book said that provisions of current law were 
designed during the height of the farm crisis 
it is now time to reform our farm programs and not wait until 
the current farm bill expires nearly two years hence it said it 
added that bush has called on agriculture secretary clayton k 
yeutter to work with the congress to develop a specific set of 
initiatives designed to reduce federal farm expenditures by 2 
billion in 1990 
it reviewed an array of possible means of cutting the 
expenditures ranging from a speeded up lowering of target prices 
used to calculate incomesupport payments to reducing the number of 
acres eligible for payments 
on capitol hill rep e kika de la garza dtexas chairman of 
the house agriculture committee issued a statement saying he would 
make every effort possible to work harmoniously with my fellow 
texan president bush 
however as it is currently proposed the administrations 1990 
budget still makes unreasonable demands upon agriculture which has 
already given 30 billion in cuts from proposed budgets over the 
last eight years 
we in agriculture are prepared to make a fair contribution but 
this administration is asking us to take cuts which represent 
considerably more than our fair share of the budgetbalancing 
burden de la garza said 
i would remind everyone that if we cut out the entire amount 
proposed for agricultural spending it would still make only an 
almost infinitesimal impact on the total budget situation he 
added 
senate agriculture committee chairman patrick j leahy dvt 
said the farm cuts envisioned would be double the automatic cuts 
prescribed if congress failed to reduce the deficit under the 
grammrudman act 
an agricultural budget cutting twice as deep as the 
grammrudman sequester is not a kinder and gentler budget leahy 
said 
when the 1990 reagan budget was released i expressed my hope 
that it was designed to make the bush budget kinder and gentler 
leahy said i also expressed my fear that the reagan farm cuts 
would undermine a tough us negotiating position in the gatt 
talks he said i am very disappointed that the bush budget is 
neither kinder to the farmer nor tougher on our competitors in the 
gatt negotiations 
the gatt is the 97nation general agreement on tariffs and trade 
which governs much of global commerce talks on updating the 
agreement have been going on for the last two years

i should be clear on the conditions attached to my recommendation 
for the coming year 
the savings must be allocated to those priorities for investing 
in our future that i have spoken about tonight 
this defense freeze must be part of a comprehensive budget 
agreement which meets the targets spelled out in the 
grammrudmanhollings law without raising taxes and which 
incorporates reforms in the budget process 
i have directed the national security council to review our 
national security and defense policies and report back to me within 
90 days to ensure that our capabilities and resources meet our 
commitments and strategies 
i am also charging the department of defense with the task of 
developing a plan to improve the defense procurement process and 
management of the pentagon one which will fully implement the 
packard commission report many of the changes can only be made with 
the participation of the congress so i ask for your help 
we need fewer regulations we need less bureaucracy we need 
multiyear procurement and twoyear budgeting and frankly we need 
less congressional micromanagement of our nations military policy 
securing a more peaceful world is perhaps the most important 
priority id like to address tonight we meet at a time of 
extraordinary hope never before in this century have our values of 
freedom democracy and economic opportunity been such a powerful 
political and intellectual force around the globe 
never before has our leadership been so crucial because while 
america has its eyes on the future the world has its eyes on 
america 
it is a time of great change in the world and especially in the 
soviet union prudence and common sense dictate that we try to 
understand the full meaning of the change going on there review our 
policies carefully and proceed with caution but i have personally 
assured general secretary gorbachev that at the conclusion of such 
a review we will be ready to move forward we will not miss any 
opportunity to work for peace 
the fundamental fact remains that the soviets retain a very 
powerful military machine in the service of objectives which are 
still too often in conflict with ours so let us take the new 
openness seriously let us step forward to negotiate but let us 
also be realistic and let us always be strong 
there are some pressing issues we must address i will vigorously 
pursue the strategic defense initiative the spread and even use of 
sophisticated weaponry threatens global stability as never before 
chemical weapons must be banned from the face of the earth never 
to be used again this wont be easy verification will be 
difficult but civilization and human decency demand that we try 
and the spread of nuclear weapons must be stopped i will work to 
strengthen the hand of the international atomic energy agency our 
diplomacy must work every day against the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons 
and around the globe we must continue to be freedoms best 
friend we must stand firm for selfdetermination and democracy in 
central america including in nicaragua for when people are given 
the chance they inevitably will choose a free press freedom of 
worship and certifiably free and fair elections

we must strengthen the alliance of industrial democracies as 
solid a force for peace as the world has ever known this is an 
alliance forged by the power of our ideals not the pettiness of our 
differences so let us lift our sights to rise above fighting 
about beef hormones to building a better future to move from 
protectionism to progress 
i have asked the secretary of state to visit europe next week and 
to consult with them on the wide range of challenges and 
opportunities we face together including eastwest relations and 
i look forward to meeting with our nato partners in the near future 
i too shall begin a trip shortly to the far reaches of the 
pacific basin where the winds of democracy are creating new hope 
and the power of free markets is unleashing a new force 
when i served as our representative in china just 14 years ago 
few would have predicted the scope of the changes weve witnessed 
since then but in preparing for this trip i was struck by 
something i came across from a chinese writer he was speaking of 
his country decades ago but his words speak to each of us in 
america tonight 
today he said we are afraid of the simple words like 
goodness and mercy and kindness 
my friends if were to succeed as a nation we must rediscover 
those words 
in just three days we mark the birthday of abraham lincoln the 
man who saved our union and gave new meaning to the word 
opportunity lincoln once said i hold that while man exists it 
is his duty to improve not only his own condition but to assist in 
ameliorating that of mankind 
it is this broader mission to which i call all americans because 
the definition of a successful life must include serving others 
to the young people of america who sometimes feel left out i 
ask you tonight to give us the benefit of your talent and energy 
through a new program called yes for youth entering service to 
america 
to those men and women in business remember the ultimate end of 
your work to make a better product to create better lives i ask 
you to plan for the longerterm and avoid the temptation of quick 
and easy paper profits 
to the brave men and women who wear the uniform of the united 
states of america thank you your calling is a high one to be 
the defenders of freedom and the guarantors of liberty and i want 
you to know that the nation is grateful for your service 
to the farmers of america we appreciate the bounty you provide 
we will work with you to open foreign markets to american 
agricultural products 
to the parents of america i ask you to get involved in your 
childs schooling check on their homework go to the school meet 
the teachers care about what is happening there it is not only 
your childs future on the line it is americas 
to kids in our cities dont give up hope say no to drugs stay 
in school and yes keep hope alive 
to those 37 million americans with some form of disability you 
belong in the economic mainstream we need your talents in americas 
work force disabled americans must become full partners in 
americas opportunity society

the yacht thursdays child has been slowed 
by poor winds in its quest to break a new yorktosan francisco 
speed record that has stood for 135 years the sloops ground 
support said thursday 
it would be miraculous if they made it by friday said 
spokeswoman nancy lush from the st francis yacht club where 
thursdays child will berth after reaching the finish line marked by 
the golden gate bridge 
the racer reported by radio at midday thursday it was 300 miles 
south of the golden gate making only 6 knots in unfavorable winds 
she said 
the 60foot 10ton stateoftheart racing sloop entered 
california waters before dawn if it made the golden gate by friday 
thursdays child would crack the 1854 mark set by the clipper flying 
cloud by 10 days 
but the support group estimated that at the current rate the 
arrival probably would be on saturday 
the threemember crew who left new york on nov 23 closed in on 
the worlds oldest existing speed record duplicating a 14500mile 
passage around fearsome cape horn at the tip of south america the 
legendary threemasted flying cloud made the journey in 89 days 8 
hours 
after hitting galeforce winds up to 40 knots earlier in the day 
thursdays child apparently hit shifting winds to the north forcing 
it into a time consuming tacking drill across the wind in order to 
continue north said steve black part of the boats ground support 
black said the three crewmen were all well they are skipper 
courtney hazleton 32 owner and master warren luhrs 44 and lars 
bergstrom 54 who helped design the vessel which features the 
latest in pushbutton satellite navigation equipment 
earlier this week hazleton called the adventure some of the 
finest sailing i ever had i would do it again at the drop of a 
hat 
even if thursdays child succeeds in breaking the record the 
vessels mark may be vanquished before it can even be written in the 
history books black said three other boats are now at sea trying to 
better thursday childs time 
the merchantman flying cloud with its 17story masts that could 
carry 35 sails was the marvel of its day it was reputed the 
fastest of thousands of sailing vessels that raced each other across 
the atlantic and pacific often with perishable cargoes

to the families of america watching tonight in your living rooms 
hold fast to your dreams because ultimately americas future rests 
in your hands 
and to my friends in this chamber i ask for your cooperation to 
keep america growing while cutting the deficit that is only fair to 
those who now have no vote the generations to come 
let them look back and say that we had the foresight to 
understand that a time of peace and prosperity is not a time to 
rest but a time to push forward a time to invest in the future 
and let all americans remember that no problem of human making is 
too great to be overcome by human ingenuity human energy and the 
untiring hope of the human spirit i believe this i would not have 
asked to be your president if i didnt 
tomorrow the debate on the plan i have put forward begins i ask 
the congress to come forward with your proposals if they are 
different let us not question each others motives let us debate 
let us negotiate but let us solve the problem 
recalling anniversaries may not be my specialty in speeches but 
tonight is one of some note on feb 9 1941 just 48 years ago 
tonight sir winston churchill took to the airwaves during britains 
hour of peril 
he had received from president roosevelt a handcarried letter 
quoting longfellows famous poem sail on oh ship of state sail 
on oh union strong and great humanity with all its fears with 
all the hopes of future years is hanging breathless on my fate 
churchill responded on this night by radio broadcast to a nation 
at war but he directed his words to roosevelt we shall not fail 
or falter he said we shall not weaken or tire give us the 
tools and we will finish the job 
tonight almost a halfcentury later our peril may be less 
immediate but the need for perseverance and clearsighted fortitude 
is just as great 
now as then there are those who say it cant be done there are 
voices who say that americas best days have past that we are bound 
by constraints threatened by problems surrounded by troubles which 
limit our ability to hope 
well tonight i remain full of hope we americans have only begun 
on our mission of goodness and greatness and to those timid souls 
i repeat the plea give us the tools and we will do the job

iranian leaders said they may have made a 
mistake by trying to win a military victory over iraq and said the 
us navys intervention in the persian gulf was a setback that may 
have decided the war 
president ali khamenei parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani and 
chief justice musavi ardebili also said in interviews with the 
official islamic republic news agency that the islamic revolution is 
still a long way from reaching its objectives 
the interviews monitored in nicosia in recent days came as iran 
celebrated the 10th anniversary of the islamic revolution with the 
leadership divided over what direction iran should go 
the comments on the war and irans strategic failures were the 
first by senior figures to shed light on the inner workings of 
tehrans military planning and its eventual decision to accept last 
years ceasefire in the 8yearold gulf war 
ardebili noted that the naval intervention in the gulf by the 
us and several european navies to protect shipping from iranian 
attack was a severe jolt for tehran 
we saw that the united states was prepared to send its navy 
into the persian gulf and pull the world along with it he said 
we had not taken that into account 
he noted i am among those who believe that the war should have 
been stopped after the liberation of khorramshahr 
the iraqis were driven out of that southern iranian port city on 
the shatt alarab waterway in 1982 nearly two years after they 
invaded iran following border skirmishes 
the iranian news agency did not say whether ardebili indicated he 
had opposed ayatollah ruhollah khomeini whose objective was to 
defeat iraq and topple president saddam hussein in 1982 or sought 
to convince him to end the war after the iraqis were driven back 
across the border 
the news agency quoted rafsanjani as saying of irans aim of 
military victory we took too big a bite 
yes we wanted something but were not able to get it and that 
was military victory if we had moved with a bit more planning maybe 
it would not have been so far off 
ardebili said that iran accepted the un ceasefire resolution 
last year after the iranian leadership had done some calculations 
on our capabilities after a series of iraqi offensives that left 
iranian forces in disarray 
the news agency reported few comments by khamenei on the conduct 
of the war but when asked whether the revolution had achieved its 
goals he was quoted as saying its true we have not reached our 
destination and we might not even be halfway there 
but we have started to move in the right direction and this is 
very important so the revolution can by no means be branded a 
failure

former junior health minister edwina currie emerged 
smiling wednesday from a grilling by fellow lawmakers over her 
remark that most british egg production was affected by food 
poisoning bacteria 
she stonewalled every question and acted like a grande dame 
said lawmaker ann winterton a fellow conservative party member 
after the session of the house of commons select committee on 
agriculture 
for nearly eight weeks mrs currie resisted the committees 
summons to appear before it to explain her remark which outraged 
poultry farmers and led to tons of unsold eggs 
in an offthecuff remark in a brief tv interview she said 
most of the egg production in this country sadly is now infected 
with salmonella 
her notorious words came during a scare over dangers from eating 
eggs when one possible cause of infection mentioned was bad feed 
given to chickens 
as farmers filed lawsuits against the government seeking 
compensation prime minister margaret thatcher ordered mrs currie 
to resign nine days before christmas 
mrs currie told the committee she hadnt meant that most eggs 
were affected by salmonella bacteria as one committee member 
suggested she said that was a misrepresentation by the media 
mrs currie said she still believed that a significant number of 
birds in a significant number of laying flocks were infected so 
many eggs were eaten every day that even if only a small proportion 
of them were affected by the bacteria they amounted to a very large 
number she said 
mrs currie 42 showed up before the bipartisan committee after 
it threatened to force a house of commons motion compelling her to 
appear the times of london said this procedure was last used 350 
years ago 
the government is paying out nearly nearly 7 million in 
compensation for 108 million eggs destroyed and some 450000 
slaughtered chickens it also launched an 865000 advertising 
campaign to reassure people they could eat eggs without fear 
although it was best to hardboil them for little children the 
elderly and the sick

president bush tonight unveils a budget plan 
keyed to his campaign promises of kinder and gentler programs 
without new taxes but it leaves difficult decisions on reducing the 
federal deficit for later 
the president in a 9 pm est speech before a joint meeting of 
congress will call for a nation more competitive abroad and more 
compassionate at home 
to those ends he will propose more federal spending in fiscal 
1990 for clean air and clean coal technology for science and space 
for aids research and aid to the homeless education and child care 
according to administration and congressional sources 
bush claims that those costs will be offset by about 4 billion 
in new revenue from a controversial cut in the capital gains tax 
another campaign promise and 2 billion by holding the expansion 
of the military budget to the rate of inflation

twenty years ago bert massie had trouble getting 
served in restaurants fire regulations were cited by proprietors to 
keep him out of movie theaters and nightclubs on trains he rode in 
the baggage or mail car without light heating or access to a 
restroom 
things arent that bad these days for massie a 39yearold polio 
victim who has been using a wheelchair since childhood but welfare 
groups say many disabled people in britain are faced with poor 
facilities unemployment poverty and public indifference 
there has been a transformation massie said in an interview 
thats not to say theres not a lot more to do 
he recalls going into a cafe in northern england in the late 
1960s and being told by the manageress we dont serve 
wheelchairs 
i told her the wheelchair wasnt hungry 
nowadays he said restaurants automatically remove a chair at a 
table to make room for his wheelchair movie theaters and nightclub 
workers carry him upstairs if necessary british rail given one or 
two days notice will provide a space in a firstclass compartment 
for a secondclass ticket 
but branchline trains or locals with nonsliding doors still 
relegate wheelchair users to the car or compartment at the end of a 
train that is used by crewman known as the train guard 
all public buildings built since 1987 must be 
wheelchairaccessible but many existing offices hotels shops 
restaurants pubs and theaters in london like other european 
cities have steps and lack suitable elevators and toilets 
i think a lot of people are in the margin i dont think 
disabled people yet are treated as totally equal citizens said 
massie an assistant director in the royal association for 
disability and rehabilitation a national umbrella body for 440 
disability groups 
critics say the government does not adequately cover the extra 
costs of being disabled leaving many caught in what opposition 
labor party legislator jack ashley called a poverty trap 
ashley who is deaf said in an interview because many of them 
are poor they clearly arent able to integrate into society as much 
as they ought to be able to and we want better financial provision 
for them 
poverty is something which is almost part and parcel of 
disability 
ashley is chairman of the allparty disablement group in 
parliament 
disabled rights groups want a taxfree national disability income 
of 70 to 225 a week 
a 198588 government survey found that 62 million adults in 
britain or one in nine have at least one disability that 
significantly impairs their activity almost 70 percent are over 60 
the report said disabled people under 65 earned an average net 
income of 171 a week compared with 238 among the general 
population most disabled people live on state aid it said 
the conservative government said it spent 12 billion last year 
on disability benefits 90 percent more in real terms than in 1979 
when prime minister margaret thatcher took power 
but critics charge the government is cutting back slowing down 
funds for remodeling private houses and preventing disabled people 
from moving out of state institutions 
there is a constant battle making sure what has been won will

disability groups estimate that about twothirds of disabled 
people available for work are unemployed the law obliges companies 
to hire a quota of disabled people but statistics indicate that 
only 27 percent comply 
the 1944 law says it is not an offense to be below quota 
unless an employer rejects a suitable disabled person 
in certain cases there are not enough disabled people to fit 
those jobs said employment department spokesman mike webb any 
firm can ask for exemption and it is almost always granted 
the government said it is committed to integrating disabled 
children into mainstream schools and pays 554000 adults 40 a week

ten years after italy legalized abortion the law is 
under attack by those who maintain it is too loose and has failed to 
stop back alley abortions 
after bitter debate and street protests by proandcon forces 
parliament approved the socialistdesigned abortion law in may 1978 
over the objections of the roman catholic church three years later 
the antiabortion movement for life led by a christian democrat 
politician tried to overturn the law by a popular referendum but 
lost 673 percent to 327 
now the movement for life and other antiabortion forces close to 
the church are clamoring for changes that would drastically restrict 
the cases in which abortion is permitted 
they dont want a referendum now says luigi laratta who 
heads the italian association for demographic education roughly the 
equivalent of planned parenthood but in a couple of years there 
will be the climate for it 
laratta was referring to the increased political clout of such 
conservative groups as communion and liberation the group founded 
by a milanese priest as a foil to leftist groups enjoys 
considerable support from the christian democrats italys dominant 
political party 
a telephone survey by panorama a leading newsweekly found that 
516 percent of those polled thought the law was just while 475 
percent did not and 09 percent didnt know of those who considered 
themselves practicing catholics 593 percent said the law was 
not just and only 392 said it was just 14 percent of them didnt 
know 
among the champions for restrictions on the current law is health 
minister carlo donat cattin a christian democrat 
even some of the laws original supporters say the time has come 
to correct what many see as abuses that both widen loopholes for 
midterm abortions and make it difficult for a women to obtain a 
legal one 
the law requires public hospitals and those that accept patients 
paid for by the government to have doctors available to perform 
abortions it forbids private clinics from doing them 
in a major concession to antiabortion forces it allows doctors 
nurses and orderlies at public hospitals who object to abortion to 
be excused from performing them or assisting in them 
both sides agree doctors have abused the clause to further their 
careers the critics say some doctors invoke the clause in order to 
devote more time to practicing other procedures and gaining 
experience that could lead to a betterpaid post at a private clinic 
estimates put the percentage of objecting doctors at 60 percent 
to 70 percent some public hospitals in the south italys poorest 
and most conservative region were forced to stop performing 
abortions because all of their doctors became objectors 
the result is that many women either must put up with long 
waiting periods or go to private clinics and pay as much as 730 for 
an illegal abortion others turn to mammane women who perform 
abortions secretly in their homes often in unsanitary conditions or 
with crude instruments that harm the woman 
eliminating clandestine abortions was the aim of the law 
in 1986 an estimated 125000 illegal abortions were performed in 
italy compared to 196490 legal procedures 
the 1978 law permits abortions in the 13th through 20th week of 
pregnancy only if the mothers health is jeopardized or the fetus 
has deformities but antiabortion forces charge that the 
restriction is frequently ignored communion and liberation has 
called for the establishment of ethics committees in public 
hospitals to decide whether to approve midterm abortions 
the debate over abortion exploded when health minister cattin 
ordered the seizure of patients records at a milan hospital where 
two objector doctors claimed a woman had been allowed to abort 
in her fifth month for a fetal deformity they judged not very 
serious 
cattins actions sparked cries of violation of patients rights 
of privacy and calls by the communists for his resignation 
laratta and others who want to keep the abortion law say the 
state must do more to promote contraceptive use 
some 2 million abortions have been performed legally in italy 
now a country of 56 million people since the law was passed and 
the number of abortions has been slowly decreasing in the past few 
years italy did not approve use of government health insurance for 
payment of birth control bills intrauterine devices iuds and 
diaphrams until 1981 
birth control use in italy is low but on the rise laratta says 
in 1984 only 33 percent of women in calabria in the deep south 
used secure methods such as the pill or an iud while the figure 
for the industrial north was about 10 percent to 11 percent latest 
figures put the use of these methods in the south at about 12 
percent and overall italy at less than 20 percent

the japanese are beginning to look away from 
tokyo as the nations power center and toward places like osaka or 
kumamoto in the faroff south for new development and economic 
influence 
the new thrust japan is not just tokyo 
for many japanese now crammed into the capital city it could 
mean a return to their roots in the countryside for good jobs and 
less stressful living 
here in the heart of this industrial city a dozen new skycrapers 
tower over the osaka castle a 400yearold landmark casting their 
shadow on a serene historic site but at the same time looming as a 
new symbol of decentralization in japan 
the complex called osaka business park is one of dozens of 
largescale development projects launched by local business groups 
in a campaign to reverse the flow of economic power to tokyo 
not only mighty regional centers like osaka but smaller and more 
remote towns also have begun their own development projects that are 
luring hightech industry and beckoning their talented offspring 
home from tokyo 
one such place is kumamoto 560 miles southwest of tokyo about 
as far away from the capital as you can get without leaving japan 
proper it is the first of 26 locations designated as a 
technopolis by the ministry of internatinal trade and industry 
the model city there already has research facilities and is to be 
expanded to encompass two cities 12 towns and two villages and 
cover nearly 40 square miles 
its tranquil affluent and easygoing says morihiro 
hosokawa the local governor it also has an abundance of flat 
cheap land 
the area already has persuaded major corporations like honda 
motors and matsushita electric to set up branch offices it is also 
the home of kyushu nec which claims to be the worlds largest 
producer of integrated circuits 
for decades tokyo has been at the pinnacle of japans highly 
centralized society drawing much of the best the nation had to 
offer but as its concentration of political power and its growing 
role as a world financial center stretch its physical and spiritual 
limits more japanese are beginning to think the capitals dominance 
should be reduced 
planners also warn that another earthquake in tokyo like the one 
that killed 143000 people in 1923 could devastate the countrys 
centralized infrastructure and severely damage both the japanese and 
world economies 
osaka japans business and industrial center before world war 
ii is in the western kansai region about 250 miles southwest of 
tokyo 
community and business leaders there have begun a massive 
development program for the region of more than 135 million people 
the project calls for the building of japans first 24hour 
international airport a kansai science city for students 
researchers and their families and the asia and pacific trade 
center planned with the hope of displacing hong kong as a major 
distribution center for asia once the british colony reverts to 
chinese rule in 1997 
by the year 2000 direct investment in the projects will total at 
least 122 billion analysts say with indirect investment possibly 
doubling that figure 
during japans postwar rush to reindustrialize few questioned 
tokyos dominance with the best schools jobs and entertainment 
tokyo drew millions who dreamed of better lives as well as hundreds 
of companies wanting to be near government agencies banks 
financial markets and uptodate information 
as a result more power has become concentrated in tokyo than in 
almost any other single city in the world 
thirty million people live in the greater tokyo metropolitan area 
a quarter of japans population crowded into 2 percent of its area 
triggering the highest land prices in the world choice commerical 
real estate was selling for 67 billion an acre last year for 
those unable to afford to live in tokyo itself commuting to work 
can take more than four hours a day 
while tokyos attraction still hasnt faded people in rural 
areas and cities like osaka have begun emphasizing their own local 
strengths and diversity 
cultural and technological overcentralization is dangerous 
and if we dont do something about it its likely to create cracks 
in our society says kazuro kuriyama head of research for the 
kansai economic federation a grouping of kansai businesses 
for many japanese regional revitalization means a return to 
traditional values at a time when so many people no longer live with 
their relatives or in their hometowns 
towns are reviving and promoting local festivals crafts and 
delicacies while tv shows such as rediscover japan and 
wonderful trip around japan introduce the lifestyle and customs 
of local communities 
beer companies are introducing local flavor brews designed to 
appeal to local pride and taste and the post office plans to 
release a new series of regional stamps 
even the national government is encouraging a shift away from 
tokyo 
prime minister noboru takeshita has said the government will 
distribute 100 million yen 800000 to each of 3200 or so 
villages towns and cities for use in improvement projects 
the cabinet also is moving 79 secondary government bodies out of 
tokyo

karen russells frantic screams rattled 
windows up and down valley spring lane but no samaritans on this 
quiet suburban street abandoned their thursday night suppers to come 
to her rescue 
even miss russells friends and colleagues standing just yards 
from the violent poolside assault kept perfectly still 
finally when he had seen enough dave decoteau looked at the 
fallen woman put his hands in his pockets and smiled a thin smile 
ok he said lets move on 
as the director of the lowbudget horror film beverly hills 
corpse decoteaus mission was to produce dead bodies as quickly 
as possible such efficiency is the only way cheap movies can make 
a profit the ugly death of miss russell slain by corpselike hands 
rocketing out of a swimming pool left one less butchering to film 
sparing every imaginable expense actors brought their own 
costumes crew members earned minimum wage and almost everything but 
the 16mm film itself was borrowed the makers of beverly hills 
corpse were able to film half a dozen garrotings and impalings in 
only five days 
a visit to the beverly hills corpse set illuminates a 
different frequently overlooked side of hollywood unlike 
flamboyant highbudget productions that swim with celebrities and 
hype this film reflects true unknown bluecollar labor much 
work little acclaim 
where directors steven spielberg and francis ford coppola might 
use a dozen or so camera setups in a day decoteau nightmare 
sisters creepozoids lady avenger raced through 57 moves 
in one 13hour shoot in the time it takes serious movie makers 
to shoot just one 15minute sequence the 90minute beverly hills 
corpse was already in the can 
ok lets move on is the battle cry of this brand of film 
making 
the plot of beverly hills corpse is admittedly witless a few 
studly young men stroll into a house chat with two women who dont 
wear much clothing have sex with them and then pretty much 
everybody dies 
the movie does not pretend to be anything it is not said 
screenwriter ross perron asked if he minds his scripts being called 
exploitive why should i mind they are 
its lack of sophistication aside beverly hills corpse could 
become more profitable than say tequila sunrise or a large 
percentage of the major studio releases now costing an average 17 
million apiece 
made on a budget of only 50000 beverly hills corpse can 
with any measure of domestic and international videocassette sales 
realize a net gain 
the dilemma on the set then was to keep costs so low theyre 
subterranean but still spit out a movie that if little else was 
in focus though shots were hurriedly lighted and most scenes were 
captured in only one or two camera takes decoteaus genius rests on 
an aptitude to make really cheap films look only semicheap 
delivering them on budget and on time only 26 he has directed or 
produced 12 b titles 
beverly hills corpse relied upon a goodnatured well 
choreographed ensemble of young technicians and struggling actors 
united by the challenges of guerrilla film making a motorcycle used 
in one scene was appropriated from sound mixer dj ritchie we 
cannibalize everything said coproducer and first assistant 
director fred kennamer we used my car in assault of the killer 
bimbos 
given a rare chance to work in a highly competitive business the 
cast and crew of beverly hills corpse willingly accepted pay far 
below union rates and read dialogue so wooden the script gave them 
splinters 
all of us are stars on the way up this is just a stop along 
the way said mike jacobs jr who is featured in beverly hills 
corpse as a rock singer named eric who through some fluke of the 
script actually walks away alive at the end of the movie 
outofwork actress lillie fields she played a nameless 
screaming woman in the 1988 remake of the blob shared jacobs 
optimism on the set not as a performer but as the craft 
services supervisor ms fields spent one recent afternoon 
refilling the carrotstick tray at the films small snack table 
its nice working here said ms fields a theater graduate 
of the university of illinois who recently moved to southern 
california because you make friends and they might have friends 
and then they can say to their friends hey i have this friend who 
needs a sag card 
membership in sag the screen actors guild is a hollywood 
paradox you cant act in a big feature film without a sag card but 
you cant obtain a sag card unless youve acted in a big feature 
film 
but for those actors and crew members who see beverly hills 
corpse as a step up to a more glorious future there are others 
like actress linnea quigley who more or less revel on the lower 
rungs 
miss quigley whose resume includes hollywood chainsaw 
hookers sorority babes in the slimeball bowlorama blood 
nasty and the upcoming assault of the party nerds has 
established herself as the meryl streep of the sliceanddice genre 
ask her to go topless or more or die a horrible death and shell 
meet the challenge gamely 
said makeup artist cindy warren she always knows her lines 
shes always on time and she never messes up 
yet it seems incongruous for miss quigley to appear in movies 
featuring countless decapitations and other abuses she is a 
vegetarian and animal rights activist i wont do a movie where 
theres violence toward animals she said 
and though usually seminude on camera she calls herself shy 
and says i wouldnt feel safe at a nude beach 
ultimately though it is miss quigleys and miss russells naked 
bodies not their death scenes or acting talents that will bring 
beverly hills corpse whatever riches it might gather when it 
debuts on videocassette later this summer 
the film lacking both requisite quality and financial backing 
will never make it to movie theaters like many of its independently 
produced kin its future will be decided at video stores both here 
and abroad with rentals costing a buck a night home video fans 
have much more tolerance for lesser films 
and since there are no ratings for videos theres no such word 
as unsuitable 
most foreign markets wont accept adult movies said 
screenwriter perron so horror movies with nudity fill the niche 
they pass right by the censors 
while perron talked the real art of slasher film making was 
being discussed in the next room where makeup artist warren 
conferred with specialeffects expert rick lalonde 
they wanted to make sure an upcoming throat slashing went well 
as the two held up their own concoctions of fake blood ms warren 
suddenly looked very serious and said do you want the more 
jugular blood or the capillary blood 
on such fine points bad horror movies become better

pauline collins is broadwaybound in a solo play 
that took london by storm last winter but its a mixed blessing for 
the british actress to go it alone in a foreign country 
the sad thing is youve got no one to nudge from the stage and 
say isnt this good or bad or whatever said the lone performer 
in willy russells shirley valentine opening feb 16 at the 
booth theater 
on the plus side collins is appearing in material she admires a 
luxury not always available to actors 
first of all i really love the play i left the london run 
feeling i hadnt had enough said the actress bestknown to 
americans as sarah the downstairs maid in the popular british tv 
series upstairs downstairs 
written by the author of educating rita and the current 
london musical blood brothers shirley valentine is a 
lengthy essentially comic soliloquy about a bored liverpudlian 
housewife who at age 42 decides to do something about her unused 
life 
collins emphasized that shirley valentine is more than a 
series of barbed knowing oneliners 
this is a play thats the extraordinary thing about it 
collins said over coffee in the spacious north london home she 
shares with her husband actor john alderton and their three 
children 
shirley valentine premiered in 1986 in russells native 
liverpool with local actress noreen kershaw it opened on londons 
commercial west end last january winning collins the best actress 
award from drama magazine and a nomination for this years laurence 
olivier awards a separate production opened in sydney australia 
on dec 30 
in the fall collins beat out such candidates as cher to repeat 
the part in the movie version with added characters played by tom 
conti and julia mckenzie due for release next september it is 
directed by lewis gilbert who filmed educating rita 
the 750000 broadway production is being staged by its london 
director simon callow the british movie and stage actor a room 
with a view amadeus making his new york directorial debut 
collins who grew up near liverpool is confident that the 
british references and phrases in shirley valentine wont limit 
its appeal 
theres always that which is undone in all of us that little 
bit more you ought to do collins said of shirleys dilemma as 
the character takes solace from drudgery in her wit and dreams of 
escape 
the role is partly a lighter variant of collins previous west 
end assignment replacing julia mckenzie as the anguished 
middleclass housewife in alan ayckbourns woman in mind 
but she feels shirley valentine has helped widen her acting 
range 
it allowed me to move into an area closer to my own age 
because i think when you have a round face you tend to be caught in 
a peculiar nebulous youth for a long time said collins dark 
shoulderlength hair framing her full cheeks 
because of the way the world is moving now theres a greater 
interest and indeed a greater market for plays about middleaged 
people said collins 48 who spent years playing pert and 
youthful comic leads in such vehicles as oscar wildes the 
importance of being earnest and bernard slades romantic 
comedy 
there are a lot of middleaged people about with money to spend 
who want to see themselves on screen and stage and even as models 
television roles occupy much of her time in the spring she and 
her husband will appear in six onehour episodes of a new show 
forever green about a london couple who uproot to the country 
frequent collaborators the couple were seen on american tv in the 
show no honestly but they resisted offers to remake the series 
appearing as two americans 
facing her first broadway appearance collins knows the stakes 
are high the line between success and failure is very much 
stronger there youre either a success or you aint she said 
but she is philosophical about the muchvaunted power of the new 
york critics 
theres no point wasting energy worrying about that collins 
said all i can do is put the best i can into it and hope they 
like it if they dont then presumably their power will close it 
so i wont be suffering too long

fifty years after the outbreak of world war ii the 
1989 berlin international film festival has paused for reflection on 
the conflict that divided europe and is probing the scars it 
inflicted throughout the world 
the 39th annual film event has set no specific war theme for this 
years contest and will in fact exhibit some prominent entries 
delving into unrelated subjects such as alan parkers mississippi 
burning and barry levinsons rain man 
but the festival which opened feb 10 has coupled the golden 
bear competition with a retrospective marking what would have been 
the 100th birthday of germanamerican producer erich pommer and a 
showing of films made in 1939 that appear to have inspired european 
filmmakers to take another look at those troubled times 
as a tribute to pommer who fled nazi germany the year adolf 
hitler took power and returned after the war to rebuild the nations 
film industry the festival will screen 34 of the prolific 
producers works including the blue angel starring marlene 
dietrich and several films directed by his lifelong associate fritz 
lang pommer died in los angeles in 1966 
the wartime thread running through the festival is enhanced by 
the memorial series europa 1939 which resurrects 50 films 
produced that year in 10 european nations giving audiences a full 
taste of the society culture and politics of a continent on the 
brink of disaster 
an accompanying forum for young filmmakers likewise breathes in 
the historical atmosphere of europe a half century after hitlers 
march began max ophuls critically acclaimed documentary hotel

the bittersweet recollections of a bavarian farm 
girl deprived of youth by her mothers early death and the hardships 
imposed by world war ii have for more than four years been stirring 
a nostalgia for the simple life of bygone years 
anna wimschneiders truelife story herbstmilch autumn 
milk is a major motion picture in west germany as a subtitled 
commercial offering during the 39th berlin international film 
festival it will seek an audience worldwide 
herbstmilch was directed by joseph vilsmaier and released 
last month by senator films in munich it will make its 
international debut at the film festival 
the movie shot entirely on location in the scenic bavarian 
countryside around wimschneiders village near pfarrkirchen adopts 
the harsh and simple style of the 1984 bestselling novel in its 
portrayal of life 50 years ago 
annas naive bliss as the barefoot and carefree eldest daughter 
among seven children in the southern german countryside comes to an 
abrupt end when her 39yearold mother dies after the birth of an 
eighth child eight years old and grieving anna is forced to take 
over the exhausting farm chores and child care that sent her mother 
to an early grave 
the young girls father comes off in the film as a harsher man 
than the author recalls him to have been beating her for bad 
cooking and for falling asleep at the sewing machine where late each 
night she sews by lamplight to earn money to feed the family 
she finds a shortlived happiness in the courtship of a local 
farmers son albert wimschneider and marries him at age 21 but 
the brief respite from hunger and hard work is broken when albert is 
called off to the front and anna must care for the farm and her 
husbands family under the cruel eye of a hateful motherinlaw 
told entirely from the perspective of isolated villagers who see 
adolf hitlers politics and the emergence of world war ii from afar 
the film brushes only gently against the stilltender subject of the 
hopes inspired among poor germans that the nazi regime would bring 
glory and prosperity 
wimschneider casts herself and her family as devoted catholics 
skeptical of the fuhrer occasionally defying the social order by 
refusing to give the heil hitler salute in town 
the few scenes in the film on the nazi administration of bavaria 
depict the local party chief as a selfindulgent villain and the 
people of pfarrkirchen as unquestioning but innocent followers 
vilsmaier also grew up near pfarrkirchen though a full 
generation after wimschneider 
the director was from the same part of lower bavaria as anna 
wimschneider which no doubt made this project an important and 
personal one for him said heinz badewitz who put together the 
series of 30 new west german films being shown at the berlin 
festival there is a new generation of filmmakers that wants to 
examine history and its effects on the present 
the film and wimschneiders book have drawn some criticism 
however for the uncritical account of the nazi influence and 
bavarians willingness to be led into a war that shattered the 
continent 
the presentation that one reviewer described as dangerously 
sympathetic is likely a large part of the films attraction for 
german viewers sometimes discomfited by the fever of retrospection 
in this 50th anniversary year of the start of world war ii 
vilsmaier whose czechoslovak wife dana vavrova plays the role 
of anna focuses more on the lifestyle of wartime bavaria than on 
the political and psychological questions still troubling the nation 
that propelled hitler in the holocaust and his destructive march 
through europe 
the film and the book both close with a comment by the 
69yearold wimschneider that sums up the nostalgia shared by many 
west germans who remember the harshness of the war years while 
carefully avoiding recollection of the horrors 
now is the wish i have had since childhood fulfilled she 
says when i want to sleep in i can sleep as long as i want

when general motors corp idles its 
sprawling assembly plant here in august one of the main engines 
driving this new england towns economy will shift into neutral 
about 1200 employees already are on furlough and 2000 more 
will be laid off framingham will lose its largest employer which 
last year paid 830000 in local taxes spent 19 million with local 
suppliers and had a payroll of 59 million 
sharon mcwey a 28yearold single mother who earned 1318 an 
hour at the plant wonders who will pay the bills if she or her 
5yearold daughter gets sick 
leonard milo owner of a framingham hardware store worries he 
may have to lay off some of his 11 employees one thing affects 
the next he said you cant keep everyone on when youre losing 
a customer that did 100000 worth of business 
gm says the troubled plant which has gone through at least five 
shutdowns since 1977 may one day reopen but industry analysts 
doubt it and many workers no longer can tolerate the 
onagainoffagain nature of the operation 
the same painful uncertainty is felt in leeds mo pontiac 
mich norwood ohio and other communities nationwide where the no 
1 automaker has been reducing production capacity for the first time 
in its 80year history 
gm which has suffered a steady erosion in its share of the us 
car market over the past several years announced last april that it 
would start closing plants in an effort to bring capacity into line 
with sales 
the reaction on wall street has been enthusiastic gms stock 
rose 125 to 73375 a share on the day of the announcement and has 
since climbed to about 93 
but the impact on main street has been severe 
talk to any shop owner any pizza place any package store in 
this town said kenneth r mercer a 34yearold framingham native 
who worked at the gm plant for four years its not just the 3000 
jobs its a whole domino effect 
gm says the 40yearold framingham plant is one of four in north 
america making buick centurys and oldsmobile cutlass cieras all of 
which have been running at well below capacity eliminating 
framingham gm says will make the other three in oklahoma city 
ste therese quebec and ramos aripze mexico more efficient 
framingham meanwhile is feeling recriminations 
some workers blame local 422 of the united auto workers for 
refusing to agree to workrule changes that might have saved the 
plant and their jobs some union activists accuse executives of 
mismanaging the plant 
if there is a consensus though it is that the plants fate was 
sealed on a single night two years ago june 17 1986 when gm 
asked for a zoning change to allow the 54acre facility to expand 
and build plasticbody minivans 
framingham population 65100 calls itself the largest town in 
america because it is the largest community still run by an 
oldfashioned new england town meeting 
with the yankee independence that town meetings are known for 
residents peppered gm officials that june night with questions about 
noxious emissions storage of plastic resins and truck traffic 
jim hanscom framinghams director of public works remembers the 
answers as incomplete and the gm officials as haughty 
it appeared they thought they were above questions he said 
after a lengthy debate gm fell three votes short 6939 of the 
twothirds majority needed for a zoning change 
this month the automaker began retooling its north tarrytown 
ny plant to make the plastic minivans originally slated for 
framingham on feb 1 gm announced that the framingham facility 
would shut down indefinitely because it does not have any new 
product to manufacture 
some residents saw the announcement as spiteful but the 
president of the local chamber of commerce michelle l flaherty 
said the town has only itself to blame 
what infuriates me is that this plant had a product two years 
ago that would have ensured its continuation into the 1990s and the 
town turned it down she said thats something we have to face 
up to 
in other moves to reduce manufacturing capacity last year gm 
laid off 4000 workers at a firebirdcamaro factory in norwood 
ohio 2500 at a stamping plant in hamilton ohio 2350 at a fiero 
plant in pontiac mich and 1300 at a buickoldsmobilecadillac 
facility in leeds mo 
even with those closings gm still has excess capacity and 
probably will have to shut at least two more plants to meet its 
stated goal of using 100 percent of its us carmaking capacity by 
1992 said thomas ogrady an analyst with integrated automotive 
resources inc in wayne pa 
framingham may be better off than some other affected 
communities because it has a diverse economic base that includes 
computer manufacturing stationery making and a 375room hotel 
in addition the unemployment rate in massachusetts at 33 
percent is the lowest of any major industrial state to help 
workers exploit job opportunities in the boston area gm and the uaw 
have opened a retraining center and gov michael s dukakis has 
announced a 250000 state grant to help fund it 
the framingham plant reopened in may after a november 1987 
shutdown that put 3700 out of work when it reopened more than 
1000 workers with 20 years or more of experience were among those 
called back hopes began anew 
because there have been so many layoffs the perception in 
everyones mind is that ill get called back said arthur t 
grniet a 24year veteran of the plant after the latest layoff 
announcement 
but some workers frustrated by the recurring layoffs and 
startups that afflict the auto industry are trying to ensure that 
the coming shutdown is the last they have to endure 
i know im going to make less money and everything said 
julio goncalves 42 who was laid off and recalled four times in 
nine years at the plant 
but enough is enough ive got to find another job and get on 
with my life even if they reopen again i dont think if im 
going to come back

moslem guerrillas who have been 
fighting the afghan communist regime are deeply divided with widely 
differing visions of the kind of government and nation they want to 
build 
the seven main afghan guerrilla groups and dozens of small or 
splinter groups range from moderate traditionalists sympathetic to 
the old afghan monarchy to fundamentalist islamic revolutionaries 
but the main problem most leaders say is who will come to power 
after the expected fall of the communist regime now that the soviet 
union has pulled its forces out of afghanistan 
there is much hope but there is also much doubt about the 
future of afghanistan said masoud khalili a senior guerrilla in 
one of a series of interviews with the associated press 
the russian invasion was the greatest challenge in afghan 
history said abdul hadi arghandewhal another guerrilla official 
now there is an equal challenge to rebuild afghanistan 
rival guerrilla groups have clashed in the past and show no sign 
of mending their divisions despite an outward show of unity 
several guerrilla groups reportedly have been stockpiling weapons 
for years for use in any internal struggle for power 
the guerrillas say they agree on forming a democratic islamic 
government under an elected head of state and legislature beyond 
that broad outline they are vague 
we want to make everyone a part of the future but not everyone 
can be a government minister said abdul haq a guerrilla 
military commander 
many afghans dismiss suggestions that they will wind up with a 
radical islamic state comparable to the one shiite moslems created 
in neighboring iran most afghans belong to the rival sunni sect 
but moderate afghans fear the future may hold little toleration 
for different or modern ideas if some of the more radical guerrilla 
organizations control any future government 
afghans are moslems but most do not want to live under a 
government that tells them how to live or how religious they must 
be said one afghan exile 
any struggle for power will be complicated by afghanistans 
historic disunity and instability the nation is deeply divided 
between ethnic tribal linguistic and religious groups that have 
competed for power for centuries 
past afghan governments exerted little real control outside the 
cities and large towns a major task in rebuilding afghanistan now 
will be finding ways to ease the divisions and promote a common 
sense of nationalism or face chronic feuding guerrilla leaders say 
this is a major problem that the war has made worse we must 
solve it but we cannot do it with slogans said abdul rahim a 
guerrilla official 
a prolonged struggle for power could erupt between the rival 
guerrilla parties the many different ethnic and regional groups and 
the semiautonomous guerrilla military commanders who actually 
control many parts of afghanistan according to some analysts 
civil war is possible if the leaders do not come up with a 
solution to afghanistans problems haq said 
afghanistan could be divided into small warring states under 
rival guerrilla commanders in the same way lebanon was broken up 
among rival power groups analysts say any central government in 
kabul the capital would be as ineffective and divided as the 
lebanese government they said 
i hope afghanistan will become like japan after the war not 
like lebanon haq said 
the thousands of guerrillas from rival groups must be disarmed to 
ensure the restoration of stability and allow construction of an 
effective civilian government afghan analysts say 
but they add that it will be hard to persuade guerrillas who have 
fought for years to surrender their weapons and power especially 
when there will be few jobs or other rewards in the desperately poor 
nation 
we must succeed with the pen as we succeeded with the gun 
haq said the mujahedeen islamic holy warriors must go school 
the people must go back to farming it will not be easy 
other guerrilla officials say afghans are exhausted from a decade 
of war and would turn against any of the guerrilla groups that start 
a struggle for power but only the main guerrilla groups they 
acknowledge have military power 
the threat of chaos and disunity will increase if afghanistans 
neighbors and the superpowers compete for influence in the country 
guerrilla officials and analysts say 
pakistan and the united states which armed and backed the 
guerrillas hope a new government will be friendly to them at the 
same time the soviet union is likely to be troubled by a government 
unfriendly to it iran also wants a voice in the future of 
afghanistan to counter us and pakistani influence in the strategic 
nation 
iraniansupported afghan shiite guerrillas also are also expected 
to seek a strong voice in a future islamic government despite 
opposition from sunni guerrilla groups who are in the majority 
we must remember that we are all afghans only that way can we 
solve our problems said khalili

in a courtyard outside a modest 
physical therapy ward 8yearold mohammad nazir practices hairpin 
turns at top speed in his new wheelchair six months ago doctors 
amputated his legs above the knees after he was wounded in fighting 
in afghanistan 
hes one of the lucky ones said wolfgang mertens who works 
for a west german foundation that helps young victims of war 
after more surgery mohammad will someday be able to walk again 
with the help of artificial legs many of the other children have 
serious bone infections many will lose more limbs 
nazir is among 46 afghan children who have been flown to west 
germany within the past month for treatment with the help of 
friedensdorf international a group that has been helping children 
wounded in wars for more than 20 years 
thirtyone badly injured afghan children arrived in west germany 
on feb 2 after a twoday ordeal that friedensdorfs director 
ronald gegenfurtner described as one of the most difficult we 
have ever made 
the children and their four guardians arrived at frankfurt 
airport on an airline passenger jet by way of india kuwait and 
switzerland 
it was the only way to get them out said gegenfurtner 
referring to the necessity of booking seats on a jetliner illsuited 
to accommodate wounded children 
there was no space for stretchers and the children could lie only 
as flat as the seatbacks would allow gegenfurtner said 
these children have suffered terribly and there are thousands 
more just like them in afghanistan in desperate need of help 
gegenfurtner said at his office at friedensdorf or peace village 
on the outskirts of oberhausen 
gegenfurtner said that among the children was a 14yearold girl 
whose leg was shattered by shrapnel during a rocket attack 
she had already lost one leg and the wounded leg developed a 
serious infection gegenfurtner said we hope we can save the 
leg because otherwise shell end up a beggar on a kabul street 
gegenfurtner had high praise for the doctors in afghanistan but 
said they were working under impossible conditions 
the doctors there are working around the clock but they cant 
create antibiotics by magic 
he said crates of antibiotics are stacked up and idle at border 
staging points unable to be delivered because of the fighting and 
bureaucratic delays 
the afghan children were taken to hospitals across west germany 
immediately after their arrival their treatment is paid for by 
donations many doctors perform surgery without charge gegenfurtner 
said 
after they are released from the hospital the children 
convalesce at peace village a cluster of cottages and 
rehabilitation facilities on a quiet green hill outside industrial 
oberhausen 
friedensdorf was founded in 1967 and immediately began helping 
children wounded in the vietnam war 
gegenfurtner said the village continues to help vietnamese 
children whom doctors say are suffering from the effects of the 
dioxinlaced defoliant agent orange 
the foundation also has helped children from lebanon nicaragua 
guatamala pakistan and several african nations

the aviation trust funds surplus has grown to 6 billion a 
reserve that its critics complain has helped the reagan 
administration hide some of the federal deficit if the trust fund 
were handled that way by a private trustee complained kelleher of 
southwest he would have been indicted for misappropriation of 
funds 
an effort to separate the aviation fund from the overall federal 
budget failed last year but the airlines have vowed to try again in 
the new congress 
but the airlines are not free of fault either according to their 
critics 
most of the capacity problems that exist today as well as many 
of the problems envisioned for the years to come stem largely from 
the strategies the airlines have devised under deregulation 
their concentration of flights at hub airports has caused 
massive peaking of traffic in and out of cities such as chicago 
denver atlanta and dallasfort worth since 70 percent or more of 
the passengers in many cases are only passing through these 
airports layover time is minimized and a large number of planes 
must land and depart in a short time 
on the other hand airports at smaller cities often beg for more 
business 
we dont have a lack of airport capacity we have a lack of 
airport capacity the way we use it today argues charles barclay 
executive director of the american association of airport 
executives a trade group representing airport managers 
barclay maintains that many airports in midsized cities are 
underused and are often ignored as possible hubs officials in 
columbus ohio have offered 30 million over 10 years to any major 
airline that would start a hub there but there have been no takers 
he says 
the airlines argue that they need significant local traffic to 
make a major hub successful 
as traffic increases barclay predicts pressure will mount for 
carriers to seek out the smaller cities as well 
the airlines also have been criticized for not following up on 
their own rhetoric on the construction of new airports they cite 
the example of the proposed denver airport 
planners foresee no fewer than 12 runways although half that 
many would be built initially for the scheduled opening in the 
mid1990s 
but both united airlines and continental airlines who are the 
major carriers at denver have balked arguing the plan is too 
grand too expensive and unneeded at this time especially in light 
of the regions economic downturn 
airports are largely financed through the issuance of bonds 
which are paid off from fees assessed to the airlines continental 
claims the new denver airport would add 36 to the price of a 
ticket compared to the 4 surcharge at the current stapleton 
international airport 
mayor frederico pena who has staked his political career on 
getting the airport built makes no secret of his anger toward the 
airlines 
either we have a crisis in air transportation in this country 
or we dont he said 
the irony of the airlines position in denver has not been lost 
on washington bureaucrats 
jim burnley transportation secretary under ronald reagan called 
the airlines stand in denver as well as the industrys lukewarm 
attitude toward developing a third major airport in the chicago area 
irresponsible and hypocritical at a time when the industry talks 
of a capacity crisis 
its time those who come to conferences in washington and sound 
off about the perceived shortcomings of the federal government in 
this area to get their own houses in order if they want to see 
capacity of the system grow in the years to come burnley said in 
an interview 
spokesmen for both continental and united insist the two airlines 
continue to favor construction of a new denver airport but the 
question is one of cost 
wed like to build one that we can afford and wed like to 
build it in the time frame that we need martin shugrue president 
of continental said in an interview 
airline reluctance to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into a 
new airport may be understandable suggest industry analysts in 
light of other costs facing the air carriers as of last october 
the scheduled air carriers had orders and options for 1301 new 
aircraft worth 59 billion and the airlines are still ordering new 
jetliners according to airline economics inc 
and there are competitive questions that come into play at an 
airport such as denver where united and continental dominate or 
chicago where american and united are supreme 
if you own the hub says faa administrator allan mcartor 
youre not too interested in adding capacity so somebody can come 
in and share your nest thats just a fact of life 
that may be one reason why the industry has yet to develop a 
master plan as to where any new airports should be built gabe 
philips executive vice president of the air transport association 
the airline trade group says such a master plan would be 
difficult to get agreement on because of the costs involved 
nevertheless insist the airlines the greatest barrier to the 
construction of new runways and airports is not the industry but 
local opposition or the nimby folks as they have been called 
the not in my back yard philosophy is not likely to go away 
soon says henry duffy president of the 40000member air line 
pilots association 
and if new airports and runways are not built duffy predicts the 
government will have no choice but to restrict traffic where there 
isnt enough capacity 
well have de facto reregulation whether we call it 
reregulation or not duffy says 
the answer in the view of many industry executives is for the 
federal government to become more aggressive in pushing for new 
airports or airport expansion where the lack of capacity is seen as 
impeding commerce 
burnley calls suggestions that a new runway or airport might be 
forced on a community as hopelessly naive and adds 
youre simply not going to be able to politically run roughshod 
over the rights of neighbors of airports the congress would not let 
us do that

the average movie at 90 feet of film a minute is about about 
9000 to 12000 feet long kodak estimates filmmakers use at least 
20 times more negative film than the finished product requires

united steelworkers officials say they will ask 
four major steelmakers for an early start to contract negotiations 
and will demand a share of the industrys renewed profits when the 
talks begin 
our people have made great sacrifices for a great many years 
we might as well get at it usw president lynn williams said 
wednesday 
contracts covering about 43700 union members are due to expire 
july 31 at bethlehem steel corp inland steel industries inc 
armco inc and national steel corp the third through 
sixthlargest producers respectively 
were prepared to meet on a schedule thats mutually 
satisfactory said bethlehem spokesman henry von spreckelsen 
the union has agreed to two consecutive rounds of contract 
concessions since 1983 
our members are working in 1989 for 1982 wage rates at best 
the usw said in a 36page statement approved by a 400member 
strategy committee 
the usw will negotiate separately but concurrently with the 
companies the talks will cover 20500 workers at bethlehem 11600 
at inland 7000 at national and 4700 at armco the usw represents 
only a portion of the workers at armco 
the contract with the largest producer usx corp runs to early 
1991 secondranked ltv corp and wheelingpittsburgh steel corp 
both are in chapter 11 reorganization and will negotiate when they 
emerge from bankruptcy court 
our unions fundamental goal is to raise the standard of 
living for our members in every possible way by negotiating improved 
income costofliving protection better benefits and working 
conditions and more secure employment the committee statement 
said 
after losing 12 billion from 198286 the us steel industry 
made profits of more than 3 billion in 198788 and is expecting 
another good year in 1989 
our members have made an enormous contribution to the success 
of the industry williams said the success theyve had should 
be justly and fairly shared with our members 
he said union negotiators will emphasize a basic wage increase 
over profit sharing 
theyre entitled to have some guaranteed improvement in pay 
williams said 
the union also wants restrictions on mandatory overtime and the 
hiring of nonunion contractors 
williams said all the companies are requiring excessive overtime 
rather than hiring additional employees which increases pension and 
benefit expenses 
we think thats wrong he said 
the companies claim that overtime is necessary because skilled 
workers are not readily available is a reflection of the failure 
of the industry to maintain its training and apprentice programs 
williams said 
for similar reasons nonunion contractors are used to maintain 
equipment and clean plants he said 
usw attorneys said theyve found cases where companies have 
contracted for janitorial services at 50 to 70 per hour and 
maintenance services at 75 to 100 per hour when usw members could 
have done the work for half as much or less 
some of these prices blow your mind said chief counsel 
bernie kleiman 
according to bureau of labor statistics figures released by the 
union from december 1982 to october 1988 the average hourly 
earnings of steelworkers including overtime earnings rose 25 
percent from 1440 to 1476 while those of coal miners rose 208 
percent from 1320 to 1595 oil refinery workers rose 222 
percent from 1349 to 1649 and auto workers rose 24 percent 
from 1298 to 1609

the multibilliondollar savings and loan crisis 
doesnt mean the death of the industry but more banks may assume 
the role of thrifts the chairman of the federal home loan bank 
board says 
you have to understand in this country we have had a very high 
commitment to home ownership a goal aided by savings and loans 
m danny wall told a meeting of international bankers wednesday 
wall also said the government actively would seek restitution 
from fraudulent thrift executives whose actions have contributed to 
the industrys losses said to be accruing at the rate of 500 
million a month 
he said the 90 billion bailout plan announced this week by 
president bush does not signal the demise of a financial institution 
created in the 1930s to help americans buy singlefamily homes 
wall who is from south dakota said there were thousands of 
banks in that part of the country whose business was much the same 
as thrifts which traditionally have catered to individual 
depositors or mortgage seekers 
over time im convinced we should allow those kinds of 
institutions to borrow from federal home loan banks he said 
wall said the plan for dealing with the hundreds of troubled 
thrifts includes a reversal of a federal reserve ban on allowing 
bank holding companies to own thrifts 
under the plan which must be approved by congress banks would 
be allowed to absorb insolvent thrifts immediately and acquire 
healthy institutions beginning in 1991 
we are overruling the fed legally wall said adding that he 
expected banks to enter the thrift industry as soon as they are 
allowed to 
wall told a meeting of the institute of international bankers 
that the expected infusion of investment money from banks would 
invigorate and perhaps save the thrift industry 
one of the possible results of the plan is the eventual merger of 
the banking and savings and loan industries savings institutions 
have lower capital requirements than banks a practice that would be 
modified under the government plan 
wall said he supported bushs proposals which include abolishing 
the threemember federal home loan bank board that regulates the 
nations 3100 thrifts the bank boards regulatory apparatus would 
be placed under the supervision of the treasury department 
the plan also would place the insolvent federal savings and loan 
insurance corp which insures thrift deposits under authority of 
the federal deposit insurance corp which insures deposits at 
commercial banks and regulates the 8000 statechartered banks 
wall also pledged to crack down on thrift institution fraud and 
cited a 50 million infusion of money under the bush plan to beef up 
federal prosecution of such crimes 
he said the bank board which does not have the power to 
prosecute cases last year obtained 100 million in settlements 
excluding a 50 million malpractice settlement with a philadelphia 
law firm involved in the failure of a florida thrift that has yet to 
be paid

philippines president corazon aquino says 
westinghouse electric corp wants to cover up alleged bribes to her 
predecessor by using an international body to secretly settle a 
lawsuit over a 23 billion nuclear plant 
defendants dont want a public accounting in their own 
country mrs aquino said wednesday in a statement issued through 
the philippines embassy in washington they would rather have a 
secret arbitration in switzerland where evidence of their action 
would be kept secret 
the philippines filed court papers wednesday in us district 
court here opposing arbitration 
in december the aquino government sued westinghouse a 
subsidiary and plant designer burns and roe enterprises inc an 
oradellbased engineering firm 
the government says the contract for the nuclear power plant 
should be canceled because of allegations that bribes were paid to 
former president ferdinand marcos other allegations include 
substandard work and construction of the plant located on the 
bataan peninsula about 60 miles west of manila near an earthquake 
fault 
westinghouse says the lawsuit is politically motivated and that 
independent analysts have verified the safety of the 620megawatt 
plant which was completed in the final months of the marcos 
administration in 1985 but never put into operation 
in middecember it filed a motion asking us district court 
judge dickinson debevoise to stay the lawsuit pending arbitration by 
the international chamber of commerce in geneva switzerland 
in its 70page memorandum the phillipines says a contract clause 
calling for an arbritrator to resolve differences between the plant 
builders and the philippines is invalid because the staterun 
national power corporation was forced to sign the agreement although 
it opposed it 
rather than competing for the project on the merits the 
defendants conspired together to pay multimillion dollar bribes for 
the benefit of former president ferdinand e marcos to assure they 
were awarded the contracts for work on the project the memorandum 
says 
the payments were allegedly arranged through herminio disini who 
was married to the first cousin of marcos wife imelda and wired 
to secret swiss bank accounts it said 
we deal here with a criminal scheme of bribery graft and fraud 
carried out by the defendants at the highest level of the philippine 
government the document says it is this criminal scheme that 
invalidates the arbitration clauses upon which the defendants base 
their motions 
westinghouse officials who said they only briefly reviewed the 
new documents said they contained no new information 
they are trying to avoid arbitration by saying there was 
some type of fraud westinghouse attorney louis j briskman said 
there is no evidence showing fraud by westinghouse 
the memorandum was accompanied by four volumes of evidence 
documenting the governments claims 
although the volumes were not immediately available a statement 
from philippine justice secretary sedfrey ordonez said they included 
over a dozen sworn statements from top marcos officials opposing the 
construction of the plant including the head of the power 
corporation 
also included are statements from a former burns and roe 
executive and westinghouse sales representative who allegedly 
participated in the scheme and documents seized in hawaii after 
marcos fled the philippines ordonez said 
the hawaii documents prove that president marcos favoring of 
westinghouse at the expense of the government and npc was not 
disinterested but was done by marcos to protect his financial stake 
in the transaction ordonez said 
marcos has since been indicted on unrelated federal racketeering 
charges in the united states but has not appeared before the court 
due to illness 
westinghouse plans to file a response in march continuing to 
push for arbitration and the judge is expected to make his ruling 
sometime after that briskman said

a productliability judgment that requires 
volkswagen of america inc to pay 100000 in damages for 
acceleration problems with its audi 5000 is another public relations 
setback for the automaker an analyst says 
a threejudge panel of the appellate division of superior court 
on wednesday reinstated a lower court jury verdict that awarded 
punitive damages to germaine gibbs of elizabeth she was injured 
along with her three children when an audi 5000 smashed through 
their apartment in 1983 
the cars driver harold horowitz of elizabeth told police the 
automobile lunged forward suddenly ms gibbs attorney james hely 
said the ruling demonstrates audis liability for a design defect 
auto industry analyst david healy of drexel burnham lambert inc 
said the ruling only adds to public relations problems for audi 
which has been dealt poor sales reports because of an unintended 
acceleration case it eventually won 
the monthly sales numbers for audis have been dismal since all 
of the publicity around the unintended acceleration arose last 
year healy said 
he said audis us sales were 60000 cars in 1986 41000 cars 
in 1987 and 23000 cars in 1988 
ms gibbs attorney shared healys belief that the ruling was 
poor for public relations 
because the truth comes out in this opinion about how they 
covered up and how they made a correction that was obvious they had 
to make it really reflects terribly on the company and how they 
handled this matter hely said 
hely had contended in lower court arguments that audi knew the 
accelerator and brake pedals were put too close together and 
sometimes caused drivers to step on both simultaneously prompting 
the car to lunge forward 
a civil jury last march decided volkswagen was responsible for 
the design problem awarding ms gibbs 100000 in punitive damages 
and 14000 in compensatory damages 
but superior court judge a donald mckenzie sided with company 
attorneys and set aside the higher award finding there was no proof 
volkswagen knew the car had problems and failed to correct them 
the appeals courts 16page decision reverses mckenzie 
in january ms gibbs asked the appeals court to reinstate the 
punitive award while volkswagen simultaneously asked the appeals 
court to also set aside the 14000 award 
the company said the appeals court opinion is directed only at 
the lower court judges discretionary powers 
the appellate court apparently based its decision on the 
feeling that the judge in the lower court had abused his discretion 
we disagree with that said john bennett a spokesman for 
volkswagen in troy mich 
we feel the judge acted within his discretionary rights and we 
are looking very carefully to see what additional remedies we might 
have he said 
volkswagen told the national highway traffic and safety 
administration in 1983 that it would take corrective measures to 
prevent inadvertent activation of brake and gas pedals at the same 
time according to court papers hely filed in arguing the case 
last month 
internal volkswagen documents and a government report conclude 
the car would lunge when the accelerator and brake pedal were 
pressed simultaneously and the pedals were arranged close enough 
that the accelerator often is applied when the driver tries to 
brake hely said 
the documents show volkswagen knew as early as 1979 of the defect 
volkswagen declined to comment about the internal documents filed 
by hely saying they were not properly introduced because they were 
not authenticated 
volkswagen attorney chuck dolan said mckenzie improperly allowed 
introduction of the documents even though it was dolan who provided 
them to the court 
bennett said the companys options include trying to obtain 
another appeals court hearing 
hely said he expected the appeals court decision to stand and 
that the supreme court would not grant a motion for the justices to 
hear the case 
bennett stressed that the case did not involve unintended 
acceleration which involves the car lunging forward uncontrollably 
when it is placed in gear

the chicago board of trade in an effort to 
restore confidence in its ability to regulate itself is considering 
a number of changes in trading procedures sources said 
but the bot the worlds largest commodities exchange does not 
intend to stop brokers from making transactions for customers as 
well as their own account according to the sources 
chairman karsten mahlmann said bot directors are reviewing other 
trading practices and have voted to spend 1 million to improve the 
computerized trademonitoring system according to people who 
attended his private onehour meeting with members wednesday 
mahlmann also announced during the meeting that the exchanges 
directors have voted to increase the maximum fine for offenses to 
250000 from 75000 the sources told the associated press 
bot officials have scheduled another membership meeting today at 
which they are expected to announce plans to develop a computerized 
system for afterhours trading 
the practice of traders making transactions for customers and 
dealing for themselves is a controversial one known as dual trading 
the bot directors unanimous endorsement of dual trading was seen 
by some as a sign the exchange will not bend to criticism at a time 
when the futures industry is under intense scrutiny by the fbi and 
us prosecutors 
the government has launched a massive investigation into 
suspected fraud at the bot and the chicago mercantile exchange and 
dual trading is one of the practices under examination 
the undercover probe which was disclosed jan 19 is tied to 
allegations that as many as 100 traders and brokers at chicagos 
futures exchanges cheated customers out of millions of dollars in 
executing their orders to buy and sell contracts for future 
deliveries of commodities ranging from soybeans to foreign 
currencies 
critics contend that dual trading creates opportunities for 
unscrupulous traders to cheat customers but supporters of the 
practice say it provides a financial incentive for independent 
traders to work in the exchanges pits thereby increasing the 
efficiency of the futures markets 
i believe in dual trading said one exchange member who spoke 
only on condition of anonymity i believe it should happen and 
should continue to happen 
commodities exchanges are overseen by the commodity futures 
trading commission a federal agency but the creation and 
enforcement of many trading rules is left up to the individual 
exchanges a policy that is favored by bot leaders 
bot officials would not comment publicly on wednesdays meeting 
but one exchange source said privately that some of the exchanges 
largest users including agricultural concerns and pensionfund 
managers had lobbied in favor of retaining dual trading 
mahlmann said other trade practices including curb trading in 
which traders execute a few buy or sell orders after the closing 
bell are under review sources said 
they said mahlmann told members that the exchanges computerized 
trademonitoring system which creates a minutebyminute record of 
trades was about 95 percent accurate 
mahlmann said that with scheduled improvements the system should 
be able to reconstruct trades with 100 percent accuracy the sources 
said

the environmental protection agency has 
sued kaiser aluminum amp chemical corp for allegedly violating 
pollution standards at its trentwood plant east of spokane 
if found liable the company could be subject to civil penalties 
of as much as 25000 per day of violations for each of eight 
emission points epas regional office in seattle said in a news 
release 
a kaiser spokeswoman susan ashe called the complaint filed in 
us district court in spokane totally inappropriate completely 
unnecessary and most regrettable 
according to the civil suit announced wednesday the federal 
government seeks a permanent injunction against kaiser prohibiting 
violations of visible emissions standards caused by releases of 
particulate matter 
also sought is an order directing the trentwood plant to comply 
immediately with clean air regulations developed by the washington 
department of ecology and approved by epa said epa regional 
spokesman bill jacobson 
the complaint accuses the kaiser plant of exceeding emissions 
standards for particulate matter on numerous occasions since 
1984 
the trentwood plant rolls and ships such products as beverage can 
lids and heattreated sheets plates and coi formal notice giving the 
company 30 
days to correct the problem said jacobson the complaint alleges 
that smoke stacks from the same plant furnaces continued to violate 
federal and state standards after the 30day grace period expired 
ms ashe the kaiser spokeswoman said in a prepared statement 
that the company has spent nearly 500000 redocumenting that 
particiulate matter within these occasional bursts of smoke from our 
remelt area were well below every health standard by which one 
measures 
kaiser also announced last month that it would install 18 
million in pollutioncontrol equipment to reduce emissions from the 
casting area 
since the regional epa office was aware of these steps kaiser 
was shocked when the civil suit was filed ms ashe said 
in essence the debate centers around the socalled opacity 
standard developed by the state industries are restricted in the 
amount of time that their smoke stacks can exceed 20 percent opacity 
basically seeing 80 percent of what one should be seeing 
epa uses that opacity standard as an indicator of how much 
particulate matter is in the air when an opacity standard is 
violated epa assumes that the federal particulate air standard is 
violated as well 
kaiser and others have argued that opacity standards do not truly 
measure the health or environmental impact of material escaping from 
stacks epa contends the opacity standard is the best available way 
to measure particulate matter 
ms ashe said kaiser has been working in good faith in the past 
year with the county air pollution control authority the state 
ecology department and the regional epa office on an equitable 
solution to what it calls an arbitrary visual emissions standard 
that has no relation to scientific fact or to health 
the aluminum company had also sought a local variance and a 
change in state law to permit any industry or regulatory agency to 
undertake studies that would lead to the establishment of a 
scientifiically sound standard 
we suspect that this regrettable decision to sue by the 
department of justice was reached in washington dc without even 
checking at the state and local level to find out how much progress 
has been made ms ashe said someone far removed from the scene 
appears to just want to chalk up a mark on the wall as an 
enforcement undertaken 
jacobson however said the civil action originated in epas 
regional office in seattle 
it was our idea we pushed it and there was concurrence from 
headquarters he said 
ms ashe said kaiser would seek to meet with all the parties 
involved in an attempt to settle the dispute if that fails the 
company is prepared to vigorously contest the action in court she 
added

italys olivetti co a leading information 
technology company will strengthen its presence in the american 
market through its purchase of isc systems corp a bank automation 
concern company executives and analysts said 
the spokane company announced wednesday it has agreed to be 
acquired and subsequently merged with bunker ramo corp of shelton 
conn a wholly owned subsidiary of ing c olivetti amp co of 
ivrea italy 
the deal will create one of the leading computer systems 
suppliers serving the financial services industry analysts said 
this acquisition reinforces our worldwide position in banking 
automation vittorio cassoni olivettis managing director and 
chief operating officer said in a prepared statement it greatly 
expands our market share in north america complementing our leading 
role in europe and japan 
the merger transaction valued at approximately 174 million 
calls for the purchase of all outstanding shares of isc common stock 
at 1225 per share in cash 
the combined companies which will have headquarters in spokane 
had revenues of approximately 250 million in 1988 of which iscs 
share was 175 million 
the merger would give the new company the thirdlargest market 
share among firms selling automated financial services systems 
behind ibm and ncr said john lindeblad current president and chief 
operating officer of isc systems who will remain in that capacity 
in the new company 
about 25 percent of olivettis sales of more than 6 billion in 
1988 were to the banking industry but little of that was in the 
united states said ted demerritt isc systems chairman and chief 
executive officer 
analysts who follow isc systems said the merger offers a good fit 
of companies in both domestic and international markets 
daniel nelson an analyst with ragen mackenzie in seattle said 
olivetti could gain from iscs presence in asia while isc would get 
a toehold in the european market dominated by olivetti the spokane 
company which has a large share of the domestic savings and loan 
market also stands to benefit from its association with bunker 
ramos commercial banking ties he said 
there are probably some synergies involved agreed dain 
bosworth analyst william whitlow in seattle they can take isc 
software and couple it with bunker ramo hardware and tie it all into 
olivetti mainframes its probably a better package and it gives 
olivetti a better product to market 
james d lindner president and chief executive officer of bunker 
ramo will become chairman and ceo of the asyet unnamed company 
demerritt will become vice chairman 
isc systems is a leading supplier of pinnacle branch automation 
systems to savings and loans credit unions and commercial banks in 
the us it also markets its products in latin america the united 
kingdom asia and canada 
bunker ramo supplies branch automation systems mostly to 
commercial banks 
isc systems announced dec 22 it would begin discussions with a 
possible suitor the announcement coincided with a restructuring 
that could eliminate as many as 120 jobs at its spokane operations 
where 750 people were employed as of jan 1 
demerritt said the merger will mean the loss of some jobs and 
reshuffling of others the reorganization announced before the 
merger will continue he said 
isc systems spokesman wes lynch said the restructuring expected 
to be completed by june will result in a workforce of between 
630650 people 
the acquisition and merger is pending approval by isc 
shareholders and federal regulatory agencies demerritt said 
isc was founded in 1977 and its products serve more than 2700 
financial institutions employing 1700 worldwide 
bunker ramo which employs about 600 people in the us was 
purchased by the olivetti co in 1986 its systems are found in 750 
financial institutions

the federal deposit insurance corp says it is 
temporarily halting savings and loan rescues until congress comes up 
with more money for the sampl deposit insurance fund 
in a statement wednesday the fdic said it will halt all deals 
until it is finished taking control of 224 insolvent institutions 
over the next month under orders from president bush after that it 
will only deal with cases that can be supported by the cash of the 
federal savings and loan insurance corp 
on tuesday fslic officials said perhaps three or four 
liquidations would be completed this quarter but rescue deals would 
not go forward the fdics wednesday statement confirmed those 
comments made at a briefing for reporters 
the fdic typically insures deposits at commercial banks but was 
ordered tuesday by the white house to oversee the ailing sampls until 
the government can decide whether to sell the institutions or close 
them and pay off depositors 
sampl regulators rescued or propped up 223 institutions last year 
mostly by issuing promissory notes to investors buying failing 
thrifts and by pledging to cover future losses the deals have been 
criticized as more expensive to taxpayers in the long run 
now no notes or loss guarantees will be considered all 
investors who had been negotiating to buy ailing savings and loans 
from the fslic will have to deal with the fdic the announcement 
said 
in another development the president of a quasipublic agency 
created to sell loans and property from failed savings institutions 
announced his resignation 
gerald p carmen former head of the general services 
administration and a political ally of former president ronald 
reagan resigned effective next month as head of the federal asset 
disposition association 
fada established in 1985 had been severely criticized for 
conflicts of interest and mismanagement in a statement carmen said 
he had turned the agency around in his year at the helm 
the agency currently manages about 2500 assets worth 38 
billion spokesman dave bunton said he said john wills currently 
executive vice president will serve as acting president 
fadas fate under bushs sampl reorganization plan is unclear he

the united states blocked a demand thursday by the 
european economic community for an official probe into us duties 
on european food imports imposed to retaliate for an eec ban on 
us hormonetreated meat 
the eec which charges that washingtons measures violate 
international trade rules made its bid at a regular twoday council 
meeting of the 96nation general agreement on tariffs and trade 
gatt sets global trade rules and is a forum for resolving trade 
disputes it traditionally operates by consensus 
eec delegate tran vanthinh urged a quick probe and warned of a 
further deterioration in the latest transatlantic trade dispute a 
meeting source reported on condition of anonymity 
many delegations backed the eecs criticism of the us measures 
in a council debate wednesday 
but at thursdays session us envoy michael samuels rejected 
the eec request for an investigation by a panel of neutral gatt 
experts saying it was premature 
senior us and eec trade officials are scheduled to hold talks 
on the issue in washington next week the discussions could become 
more complicated if gatt were to begin an investiation he said 
canada chile brazil and nicaragua also supported the eec call 
for a panel 
the eecs import ban on hormonetreated meat went into effect 
last jan 1 affecting us sales of beef and veal valued at more 
than 100 million the eec said meat treated with hormones could 
pose a health risk which washington disputes 
in response washington immediately slapped high duties on 
imports of european food products including boneless beef ham and 
pork shoulders 
eec foreign ministers approved a plan jan 23 to impose

halliburton co said thursday its earnings plunged 
36 percent in the final quarter of 1988 due to the reorganization of 
its logging and geophysical businesses 
the oil field services firm reported net income of 118 million 
or 11 cents a share on revenue of 639 million that compares with 
earnings of 341 million or 32 cents a share on 456 million in 
revenue in the same 1987 quarter 
lower worldwide drilling activity during the last three months 
of 1988 put pressure on our oil field services groups 
profitability halliburton president thomas h cruikshank said 
cruikshank said about 335 fewer drilling rigs were active 
worldwide during the fourth quarter of 1988 than a year earlier 
we believe this weakness in oil field service markets will 
continue during the first half of 1989 he said 
halliburton reorganized its logging and geophysical business 
units in the fourth quarter by forming halliburton geophysical 
services inc and halliburton logging services inc 
the company said the restructuring cost 272 million in the 
quarter halliburton said it expects savings by reducing duplicate 
efforts cutting staff and realigning international operations 
for the full year halliburton reported earnings of 936 
million or 89 cents a share on revenue of 217 billion that is 
nearly double 1987 earnings of 481 million or 45 cents a share

braniff inc will move its headquarters from 
dallas to orlando beginning in may braniff chairman william mcgee 
announced today 
the headquarters move had been expected since the airline was 
purchased by a philadelphia and new york investment group last 
summer and speculation on the location had centered on kansas city 
mo and orlando where braniff has hubs 
as a new airline we have an opportunity to use our 
headquarters location to make a statement about our desire to 
participate in the growth of one of the fastestdeveloping regions 
in the us mcgee said 
although kansas city is and will remain our largest hub our 
decision to locate our headquarters here signals our commitment to 
the growth of central florida as well mcgee told a news 
conference in orlando 
braniff moved its principal hub operation from dallasfort worth 
international airport to kansas city last year 
the relocation of braniff headquarters to orlando will involve 
the transfer of about 125 professional and administrative personnel 
mcgee said 
braniff has about 720 employees in the orlando area and mcgee 
said he expects employment there to grow by more than 425 jobs in 
the coming year 
the company earlier this month leased more than 26000 square 
feet in an abandoned terminal at the orlando airport 
bia acquisitions an investor group formed by painewebber inc 
bought braniff in june for about 100 million and became the 
airlines third owner since its 1982 bankruptcy reorganization 
the new owners immediately began an effort to rejoin the ranks of 
the nations largest carriers and the airline recently announced 
the purchase of 50 airbus a300 planes a 35 billion deal that 
would nearly double braniffs fleet

manufacturers

mich or the canron plant in columbia sc would close if the 
deal is allowed to go through

it seems inevitable that if interest rates 
continue to rise as conceivably they could many american consumers 
will have their confidence factors squeezed 
but nobody including the chairman of the federal reserve can be 
sure 
so far that confidence has been almost immune to actual 
potential and threatened events including the great stock market 
crash of l987 which created a shiver so tiny that it had dissipated 
by christmas 
since then consumers have gone on their merry way spending and 
borrowing with confidence while professional economists regularly 
talk about such things as inflation recession rising interest 
rates and other ogres 
none of these has daunted the great american consumer suggesting 
that it might take something of an economic earthquake to slow the 
propensity to spend in december consumer debt rose 54 billion to 
a total of 6673 billion 
that increase 99 percent on an annual basis wasnt a fluke in 
november consumer credit rose at an 85 percent annual rate in 
october the rate was 72 percent borrowing for cars and retail 
items rose credit card debt rose too 
the increases are explained variously by analysts as a natural 
byproduct of job security rising personal income faith in the new 
administration belief that prices are right the absence of 
runaway inflation and the like 
all these and more are the ingredients of confidence and that 
confidence at least superficially seems ready to penetrate all 
obstacles including a 10month effort by the federal reserve to 
restrain economic growth 
will it though the test of that confidence is now when higher 
taxes and high interest rates combined might toss a wet towel of 
reality at some borrowers 
creditcard interest rates for example already are high 
historically and in comparison to most other rates many issuers of 
cards charge close to 20 percent some charge even more not 
counting annual fees 
should there be further increases mainly from the feds 
insistence that interest rates are an effective and necessary 
restraint on the economy levels will be reached that once were 
considered intolerable 
making them worse still will be higher taxes true president 
bush seems determined to avoid any new taxes this year but an old 
one continues to add pressure whereas 40 percent of installment 
debt was taxdeductible last year only 20 percent will have that 
status in 1989 debt is increasingly costly 
a psychological factor enters the picture the realization of how 
costly that debt will be might not be impressed upon people for 
another year that is the true impact might not come until 
borrowers complete their 1989 taxes 
it is a seemingly deadly combination until you reflect that 
nothing over the past year including the internal revenue service 
and the federal reserve has been able to penetrate the consumers 
armor and shake up that confidence 
early returns suggest strong spending will continue in 1989 
aided by balmy weather major retailers reported january sales gains 
of 6 percent to 10 percent and a large part of such sales 
historically are on a credit basis 
meanwhile automotive dealers are ready for a big spring selling 
season adding to the temptation to use even more credit after that 
comes the lure of vacations and the cost of wedding and graduation 
gifts 
temptation is out there and over the past year it has been 
strong enough to defy restraint it provokes the question of just 
what will undermine consumer confidence if high taxes and interest 
rates are unable to do the job

the financial accounting standards board today 
announced a controversial proposal to change the way companies 
account for pension benefits a plan which could significantly 
impact company profits 
the proposed new rules scheduled to take effect in 1992 would 
require us companies to deduct promised postretirement medical 
and insurance benefits as they are earned or while an employee is 
still working for the company 
it would eliminate the payasyougo accounting method 
currently used by most companies as such companies in many cases 
under the new rule would have to deduct from their income statements 
the amount of the earned benefits instead of simply deducting the 
amount the companies actually paid in a given year 
critics of the proposal have complained that it would impact 
financial results too greatly as well as being difficult to manage 
the new rules would deal only with financial reporting of benefit 
obligations but does not address the funding of pension benefits 
fasb officials said 
the plan comes at a time of soaring health care costs longer 
life expectancy and earlier retirements which are posing economic 
problems for many companies according to fasb chairman dennis r 
beresford 
beresford said the proposal would make financial statements more 
informative and complete and would enhance disclosure of promised 
benefits 
it will require companies to publicly acknowledge their 
existing commitments to investors and other users of financial 
statements who in turn can evaluate the implications of those 
promises beresford said 
he also said the proposed accounting would not change the nature 
or extent of the current pension promises 
the cost of providing the promised benefits is the same before 
and after the proposed accounting is implemented beresford said

the nations economy will continue to expand in 
1989 but growth will slow slightly according to a report by a panel 
of economists to be released friday 
the panel of 13 economists sponsored by the conference board 
projected that real gross national product will rise about 25 
percent this year down from about 27 percent in 1988 
the group also projected that inflation would rise to 5 percent 
from 42 percent the prime interest rate would hold steady at about 
105 percent and unemployment would increase slightly to 55 percent 
under present circumstances a slowdown this year should be 
looked upon not as a signal of economic weakness but as a 
necessity said edgar r fiedler economic counselor at the 
conference board a worldwide organization of corporate executives 
faster growth of the economy would seriously heighten anxiety 
about the financial markets which in turn would be manifested in 
the form of higher interest rates more inflation and perhaps an 
earlier recession he said 
the panel said the economic expansion of the last seven years 
will be fueled by capital spending and international trade spending 
on plant equipment is projected to climb 6 percent to 7 perent down 
from a 10 percent rise in 1988 
but members of the panel said they foresee no progress in 
reducing the federal budget deficit instead projecting it will 
increase to 158 billion in fiscal 1989 up from 155 billion

this is a town thats witnessed judges on the take 
and politicians on the make and a school of scandal whose roster has 
drawn from the courts the cops even city hall 
now the feds are creating a stir in chicagos business arena with 
a massive fraud investigation of the highstakes frenzied futures 
exchanges the worlds largest commodity markets 
but in a city that once was al capones turf and has recently 
seen police convicted of protecting drug dealers judges booted off 
the bench for taking bribes and aldermen put behind bars talk of 
skulduggery in the risky business of financial futures elicits more 
knowing smirks than disapproving scowls 
since the political process has sanctioned corruption so long 
the fact that it occurs in business is no great surprise to 
chicago said dick simpson a former alderman chicagoans are 
not much surprised that people are stealing with big bucks as 
opposed to a 500 bribe its not shocking to the chicago 
mentality 
its like a spectator sport said simpson an associate 
professor of political science at the university of 
illinoischicago itll be interesting for people to see if 50 
traders go to jail or 20 or if its a millionaire or some runner 
its like watching a bullfight or a football game there isnt 
condemnation there isnt outrage that it would be a crime 
nobody has yet been indicted in the probe of the chicago board of 
trade and chicago mercantile exchange where millions of dollars are 
made and lost on future prices of items ranging from soybeans to 
foreign currency the investigation purportedly involves charges 
that as many as 100 brokers and traders systematically cheated 
customers and profited in illegal deals 
in the probe dubbed operation sour mash and operation 
hedgeclipper fbi agents reportedly posed as traders leased luxury 
apartments and wined and dined brokers recording conversations with 
hidden tape recorders and wireless microphones disguised as pens and 
rings 
the probe of the trading pits follows a history of chicago 
scandals and scoundrels ranging from men who wore cleats eight 
members of the 1919 chicago white sox who threw the world series 
to men who donned judicial black robes and fixed court cases 
at times it seems as if the city of big shoulders has become the 
home of greased palms 
things that happen here all the time would bring down a 
government in europe said political strategist don rose whos 
worked in several mayoral campaigns one thing that contributes to 
chicagos reputation for corruptionis the higher tolerance for 
it 
though citizens are sometimes jaded rose said they still get 
annoyed we accept it and we make jokes about it corruption 
he said but i think basically deep down we dont like it 
neither do prosecutors whove successfully used federal laws to 
combat local fraud 
since 1972 13 aldermen have been convicted of federal corruption 
charges two were convicted and two others await trial in operation 
incubator which used fbi mole michael raymond to uncover influence 
peddling in city hall 
theres also been operation phocus a probe of shakedowns 
involving city licensing operation lantern which investigated 
alleged payoffs in city purchasing operation deadfall in which 30 
police officers admitted they took small bribes to steer corpses to 
certain funeral homes and operation greylord the probe of the 
nations largest court system in which 81 people including 13 
judges and 46 attorneys have been convicted or pleaded guilty 
those cases dont even take into account vote fraud during the 
heyday of the political machine when chicago earned a dubious 
reputation as a place where names from tombstones sometimes found 
their way to the voting booth 
the machines quid pro quo philosophy favors for votes left 
open all kinds of opportunity for fraud simpson said 
in fact chicago tribune columnist mike royko said in boss 
his book about the late mayor richard daley that there were so many 
deals involving ranking machine members it was suggested chicago 
change its slogan from urbs in horto or city in a garden to 
ubi est mea or wheres mine 
but much has changed the machine has weakened many abuses have 
been curbed and court orders have diluted the oncepowerful 
patronage army some also say chicagos image is distorted and its 
problems are no worse than other big cities 
still constant exposure to public corruption affects the way 
people view chicagos business world said terry brunner director 
of the better government association a local watchdog group 
very few chicagoans look at a bunch of chicagoans ripping off 
international markets as all that bad he said weve adapted to 
things in this city and laugh it off thinking whos getting 
hurt it isnt us its the fat cat investors the big corporations 
its boys will be boys i dont get any big sense of isnt that 
awful 
one reason is few people have a financial interest or understand 
the commodities markets with its clubby atmosphere and chaotic 
shouting jostling and flashing hand signals 
unless one is involved in one of those markets and had some 
concern about being ripped off theres less concern than if a 
politician is on the take rose said 
in this era of wall street scandal theres also mistrust and 
even disdain for traders 
the reputation of these people is right up there with dope 
dealers brunner said you hear about these people buying 
unbelievable houses and cars because of killings they made in the 
markettheyre such high rollers theres absolutely no sympathy 
out there 
as for the trading floors themselves simpson said many expect 
fastandloose action in such a makeorbreak atmosphere 
for most people on the outside he said it looks like a 
big poker game its like if you suddenly found out in las vegas the 
poker table wasnt completely on the up and up 
but even if the investigation results in evidence of widespread 
fraud many say the impact will be on the trading industry rather 
than chicago 
i tend to think of this as a generic financial scandal rather 
than a chicago scandal rose said i dont think people look 
at ivan boesky as a new york scandal he said referring to 
the notorious speculator whose prosecution for inside trading led to 
a broad crackdown on security abuses in wall street 
yet others say chicago cant afford any more trouble because it 
hurts the city particularly its efforts to recruit investors 
it affects the image which chicago doesnt need said 
patrick healy former head of the chicago crime commission and now 
executive director of a firm that investigates whitecollar crime 
chicago can take its place among any other city of the world 
without this kind of nonsense 
healy says its frustrating because outsiders seem to be more 
interested in chicagos seamy side than its worldclass attractions 
if you talk about chicago do they talk about the art 
institute do they talk about the beach front he asked they 
ask is it still as bad as its always been we havent shaken 
that image and thats tragic

wheat and oat futures prices closed lower thursday 
on the chicago board of trade while corn and soybeans finished 
little changed in dull trading ahead of an agriculture department 
grain supplyanddemand report 
the report scheduled for release after the close was expected 
to contain lower estimates for soviet grain and argentine soybean 
production and a higher estimate for the brazilian soybean crop 
analysts said there were no significant supplyanddemand 
developments during the session and prices drifted with no firm 
direction 
the slight decline in wheat prices was due mainly to 
profittaking by a few large trading houses analysts said 
at the close wheat was 1 cents to 3 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in march at 425 a bushel corn was unchanged 
to 1 cents higher with march at 264 a bushel oats were cent

sears roebuck and co reported record 
fourthquarter revenue thursday but a 788 percent drop in earnings 
attributing the results to onetime costs in the behemoth retailers 
fight to spruce up its image 
sears earnings of 1174 million or 32 cents a share for the 
three months ended dec 31 compared with 5544 million or 146 
per share for the centuryold company in the yearearlier period 
the fourth consecutive quarterly earnings decline was attributed 
to a 500 million outlay for the massive restructuring announced 
last fall the company is attempting to streamline and overhaul its 
market approach to offer low pricing more contemporary displays and 
outside brand names 
one analyst said he considers the fourthquarter showing a 
prelude to a major upswing for the company 
sears lacked two ingredients to growth said analyst john 
landschulz with cowen amp co in chicago one was competitive 
pricing the other was a power format a really aggressive 
marketing tool i think these changes address both these key 
weaknesses 
sears has not yet begun an allout promotional campaign to alert 
consumers to its metamorphosis but edward a brennan company 
chairman and chief executive officer also predicted an improved 
balance sheet calling 1988 a year of major transition 
the fourthquarter plunge reflected aftertax accounting charges 
of 442 million for the restructuring of sears merchandise group and 
586 million for a loss on the sale of sears allstate group life 
and health insurance the company said 
fourthquarter revenue totaled a record 1456 billion up 9 
percent from 1336 billion for the yearearlier period 
sears has said the restructuring includes the planned sale of the 
landmark sears tower and coldwell bankers commercial real estate 
subsidiary plus the buyback of 10 percent of its 380 million 
outstanding shares 
the company said it would concentrate on consumeroriented 
businesses retailing insurance residential real estate and 
financial services 
before the restructuring charge the company said fourthquarter 
earnings totaled 618 million or 165 per share 
for the year ended dec 31 earnings totaled 145 billion or 
384 per share 11 percent down from 163 billion or 430 per 
share in 1987 revenue totaled a record 5025 billion up 95 
percent from 4095 billion in 1987 
sears said 1988 results include the adoption of new income tax 
and insurance accounting standards and discontinuance of allstates 
group lifehealth operations and coldwell bankers commercial 
division 
revenue for all previous periods was restated for the 
discontinued operations and the new accounting standard the company 
said 
sears merchandise group reported a fourthquarter loss of 1135 
million after the 442 million restructuring charge before the 
charge the groups fourthquarter income was 3285 million down 
from 4149 million in 1987

a government report showing a largerthanexpected us cattle 
herd knocked cattle futures prices to the mat thursday on the 
chicago mercantile exchange but analysts were skeptical of the 
reports accuracy 
on other markets cotton futures prices fell sharply grains and 
soybeans were mixed precious metals futures declined and energy 
futures were mixed 
prices for all cattle futures except the february live cattle 
contract plunged the permitted daily limit of 1 cents at the 
opening bell and stayed limitdown for the rest of the session the 
contract for february delivery of live cattle settled 140 cents 
lower at 7397 cents a pound while the nearmonth feeder cattle 
contract for delivery in march settled at 8292 cents a pound 
pork futures prices fell in sympathy with the cattle market live 
hogs finished 50 cent to 105 cents lower with february at 4190 
cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 12 cent to 113 cents lower 
with february at 3757 cents a pound 
the selloff was triggered by wednesdays semiannual usda cattle 
inventory report a head count of the nations cattle herd the usda 
reported there were 995 million cattle and calves in the united 
states as of jan 1 only a few thousand fewer than the previous 
year 
the industry consensus expectation was for the herd to total 
fewer than 98 million cattle the usda report implied that after six 
years of thinning cattle numbers producers were starting to rebuild 
their herds 
but many analysts said they did not believe the report 
especially its implication of an extremely high birth rate in the 
second half of 1988 
we had a 92 percent calving rate the highest in 15 years in a 
year when you had the driest hottest summer since 1932 said tom 
ohare an analyst in new york with smith barney harris upham amp co 
this looks like one of those aberrational things where youve 
got to wonder whats going on here he said there are just too 
many contrary things to come into the report to really believe 
it 
analysts said the bulk of the futures selling appeared to have 
come from speculative commodity funds not cattle producers or beef 
processors possibly an indication that the beef industry also was 
skeptical of the usda numbers 
cotton futures prices fell sharply on the new york cotton 
exchange on expectations that another usda report would be bearish 
for the cotton market 
and so it was in a monthly supplydemand report issued after the 
close of trading the usda estimated the us cotton stockpile on 
aug 1 would stand at 92 million bales compared with the january 
estimate of 88 million bales and the aug 1 1988 stockpile of 58 
million bales 
cotton settled 80 cent to 175 cent lower with march at 5764 
cents a pound 
grain and soybean futures were mixed on the chicago board of 
trade in dull trading ahead of the same usda supplydemand report 
in the report the government lowered its estimate for 198889 
argentine soybean production to 9 million metric tons from 11 
million metric tons and lowered its 198889 argentine corn 
production forecast to 6 million metric tons from 8 million 
the usda also lowered its 198889 soviet grain production 
estimate by 5 million metric tons to 195 million 
analysts interpreted the report as neutral to slightly bullish 
for grain and soybean futures 
wheat settled 1 cents to 3 cents lower with march at 425 a 
bushel corn was cent lower to 1 cents higher with march at 265 
a bushel oats were 1 cent to 3 cents lower with march at 206 a

company reported a 2244 million fourthquarter loss thursday 
attributing the results to travails that ranged from federal safety 
probes to labormanagement turmoil at its eastern and continental 
subsidiaries 
the octoberdecember performance compared with a 2656 million 
loss in the yearearlier period and widened the overall 1988 loss 
to 7186 million 54 percent greater than the 4662 million texas 
air lost in 1987 
miamibased eastern reported losses of 1017 million for the 
quarter on revenues of 8444 million that compared with a loss of 
1434 million on revenues of 1 billion in the same period a year 
earlier 
houstonbased continental incurred a fourthquarter loss of 992 
million on revenues of 11 billion during the same period in 1987 
continental lost 788 million on revenues of 11 billion 
fourthquarter revenue for the parent company totaled 2 billion 
vs 21 billion in the yearearlier quarter for all of 1988 texas 
air revenue totaled 86 billion the same as the year earlier

all of 1988 vs a 2581 million loss on revenues of 41 billion 
in 1987 
in a statement texas air said the 1988 results reflected the 
numerous and unprecedented challenges faced by both continental and 
eastern during the past year and that future results at the two 
airlines will reflect the fact that these challenges are being 
successfully met 
in 1988 both airlines were subject of an unprecedented 
investigation by the department of transportation and the federal 
aviation administration which determined the two carriers were run 
safely 
the probe however concluded that labor turmoil at eastern must 
be defused before it creates risks to passengers 
the turmoil intensified this week with easterns militant 
machinists who were voting on whether to authorize a strike next 
month 
last week continentals president martin shugrue quit after a 
year on the job becoming the carriers sixth former president in as

japans mazda motor corp on thursday unveiled a 
new twoseat roadster a throwback to the 1960s aimed at a part of 
the us car market with no competition 
the m5 miata is scheduled to go on sale in mazda dealerships 
nationwide this july at a base price of less than 14000 the 
miata is targeting a segment of the car market largely vacated one 
reason is the rising expense of imports a result of the dollars 
lower value in recent years 
honda motor corp another japanese automaker said it planned an 
introduction of its new twoseat acura sports car at a reported 
price of 55000 its at the other end of the price scale from the 
miata 
the carmakers disclosed their plans at chicagos annual auto 
show an important forum for rivals vying for a chunk of the 
lucrative us market officials from all major manufacturers have 
been holding press briefing prior to the shows official opening 
saturday 
mazda also unveiled a new version of its rx7 sports car with a 
redeveloped rotary engine that boosts horsepower while improving gas 
mileage the changes also pushed up the rx7s base sticker price by 
about 1000 to about 17000 said george mccabe vice president 
for sales and marketing mazda motor of america inc the automakers 
us arm 
there are no us or imported twoseat sports cars in miatas 
price range mazda officials said miata a frontengine rearwheel 
drive car was designed specifically for the us market 
mccabe said the company planned to import about 20000 miatas 
this year and boost that to about 40000 annually after that 
the twoseat sports car market has been shaky in the us during 
the past several years mccabe said dropping from 24 percent of 
the entire car market in 1986 to 13 percent last year 
he said mazda thinks interest in the car remains but the rising 
prices have made the cars less affordable 
among domestic carmakers ford officials said thursday they plan 
a newly designed lincoln town car descriibing it as a rounder 
version of the hugely successful topoftheline luxury model they 
declined to disclose the cost 
the town car for 1990 which is nearing production will retain 
its traditional interior size and trunk space but it could be longer 
than current models despite being built on the same platform said 
robert rewey vice president for sales of fords north american 
operations 
base prices for the 1989 town car range from 25562 to 29709 
the 1989 town car signature v8 engine remains for 1990 a new

winstonsalem nc ap rjr nabisco inc employees and local 
business leaders were still wondering about the companys future 
thursday as the record 2453 billion tender offer for the food and 
tobacco giant expired 
frank doss a 22year veteran of the companys rj reynolds 
tobacco co subsidiary voiced a concern held by many workers how 
would kohlberg kravis roberts amp co rjr nabiscos new owner repay 
the massive debt it took on to buy the firm 
im concerned about layoffs and possible cuts in benefits 
doss said 
kohlberg kravis is acquiring rjr nabisco through a leveraged 
buyout which involves heavy borrowing lbo debt is repaid through 
the sale of a companys assets or with its cash flow and 
costcutting and job reductions often result 
rjr nabisco workers also worried about who would eventually run 
the company and whether the tobacco divisions headquarters would be 
moved from winstonsalem 
the possible economic and social impact of the buyout could be 
farreaching in forsyth county where an estimated 15 billion in 
rjr stock is held by individuals and where thousands of jobs are 
linked to the fate of rj reynolds 
kohlberg kravis tender offer for rjr nabisco stock expired 
thursday morning and the investment firm said it had been tendered 
approximately 972 percent of the outstanding common shares 
doss and another rjr reynolds worker larry jones who has put in 
14 years at the tobacco company said they tendered their rjr stock 
before thursdays deadline they also could have sold their shares 
of the stock which closed at more than 100 a share on wednesday 
people were selling their stock and others were buying it 
jones said so i guess that says something about the faith they 
have in it 
kohlberg kravis also announced thursday that j paul sticht a 
former rjr industries inc chairman had been appointed acting chief 
executive officer replacing f ross johnson who resigned 
a group led by johnson made the first move toward buying rjr 
nabisco back in october and then fought a losing battle against 
kohlberg kravis 
ever since the takeover fight began stories circulated of 
productionline workers who would become millionaires as stock 
prices nearly doubled those stories were tempered somewhat by the 
rumors of layoffs and cutbacks 
thursdays developments passed with little notice in the streets 
around the tobacco companys headquarters rjr reynolds spokesman 
david fischel said it was not considered a landmark day at the 
division 
id say most of the excitement right now is centered at the 
banks and stock brokerage firms he said 
fred nordenholz president of the winstonsalem chamber of 
commerce said he expected there would be more fireworks before the 
deal was finalized 
when youre involved in battle the adrenalin begins to pump 
when the first shots are fired he said were waiting to see 
what happens 
it was not immediately known when the acquisition would be 
completed

eastman kodak co said thursday it wants 
to cut its nonessential costs by 15 percent and may do so by 
trimming its work force selling businesses or ending product lines 
i think it would be inaccurate to call this a job reduction 
plan said kodak spokesman paul allen were asking unit 
managers to start looking very closely at their businesses and start 
making some decisions from the viewpoint of profitability 
allen said costs directly related to raw materials and production 
wont be subject to the cutbacks but that all of the companys 
products and business units will be reviewed to determine whether 
theyre worth keeping 
over the last eight years kodak has made a lot of strategic 
acquisitions allen said what we havent done is a lot of 
strategic divestment 
the announcement came a day after kodak reported record sales and 
earnings in 1988 
kodaks 1988 profit rose 19 percent to a record 14 billion or 
431 a share compared with 12 billion or 352 a share in 
1987 sales rose 28 percent to a record 1703 billion up from 
133 billion in 1987 
the results were boosted by the contribution of sterling drug 
co which kodak acquired in february 1988 
allen said the comprehensive look at the company is part of the 
changes that have taken place at kodak since the company began a 
massive reorganization in 1984 
in a presentation to employees wednesday part of an ongoing 
series chairman colby chandler outlined the study but didnt say 
which businesses products or employees would be affected 
stock analysts said that even the company may not know for sure 
it could include some of the things in the electronics area or 
office equipment or batteries said peter enderlin an analyst 
with smith barney harris upham amp co in new york it doesnt have 
to be businesses in trouble some of the joint ventures they have 
are still very small and may have a lot of potential but arent 
worth the trouble to kodak

areas of the country by moving its corporate base to orlando 
the airline which began operating in central florida a year ago 
with the acquisition of florida express will build new maintenance 
facilities at both kansas city and orlando as well as a headquarters 
building in orlando mcgee said 
this aggressive expansion program coupled with our already 
announced plans to increase our fleet by a net of 22 additional 
aircraft this year will fuel a 35 percent companywide growth in 
employment over the next 12 months mcgee said

at 250 million in kansas city and 50 million in orlando 
the headquarters move is to begin in may and involve about 125 
professional and clerical workers now at love field in dallas the

chicago board of trade executives informed members 
thursday of plans for an electronic trading system that would 
operate during hours when the trading floor is closed sources said 
exchange chairman karsten mahlmann said the system was designed 
to give foreign investors easier access to the board of trades 
burgeoning market for us treasury bond futures according to 
exchange members who attended the closeddoor meeting 
but industry observers said the move into computerized trading by 
the worlds largest futures exchange appeared to be prompted by a 
federal investigation of suspected fraud at the board of trade and 
the rival chicago mercantile exchange 
the proposal apparently represents a 180degree turn in 
philosophy for the board of trade which last fall decried a similar 
system being developed by the chicago merc as inefficient prone to 
abuse and a poor substitute for the traditional openoutcry 
method of futures trading 
a board of trade spokesman said he could not comment on the 
meeting 
one veteran trader who attended the meeting said mahlmann touted 
the proposed system as the closest thing to the openoutcry 
system and thus superior to the globex system being developed by 
the merc 
like globex the board of trades system would use a computer to 
match orders to buy and sell contracts for future deliveries of 
financial instruments 
also like globex the system would be open to other futures 
exchanges that wish to list their products for trading 
but unlike globex which the merc is developing in partnership 
with londonbased reuters plc the board of trade system would be 
developed and owned entirely by the exchange and its members 
the exchange plans to hold several smaller meetings with traders 
over the next three weeks to explain the system before putting it to 
a membership vote march 2 according to traders who attended the 
meeting 
mahlmann said the board of trade would retain its 21monthold 
night trading session for treasury bond futures a successful effort 
to attract more business from japan 
details about the electronic system were sketchy and many 
traders who spoke on condition of anonymity left the meeting 
confused 
if the floor vote were held today i dont think it would 
pass said one trader not because people are against it in 
principle but there are just too many questions about it 
industry observers linked the exchanges change of heart about 
electronic trading to the recently disclosed investigation of 
futures trading 
what this whole scandal has done is to bring up the time when 
computerization is the norm said daniel siegel a professor of 
finance at northwestern universitys kellogg graduate school of 
management 
as soon as you mechanize youre removing the human element 
and the human element is what this latest furor is all about 
added robert e whaley an associate professor and codirector of 
the futures and options research center at duke universitys fuqua 
school of business in durham nc 
electronic trading systems use computers to match buy and sell 
orders several foreign futures exchanges already operate such 
systems 
all commodities trading in the united states now is done by 
professional traders who crowd into recessed pits on exchange floors 
and execute customer orders through a combination of shouts and hand 
signals 
abuse of this openoutcry trading method is the apparent 
target of a justice department investigation revealed on jan 19 
federal authorities reportedly are investigating allegations that 
as many as 100 traders and brokers systematically cheated customers 
out of millions of dollars while executing their orders in the 
futures markets 
the mercs globex is seen as a way to make its financial futures 
markets more convenient for overseas customers 
last september board of trade president thomas donovan urged the 
federal commodity futures trading commission not to approve globex 
contending in a letter that the proposed system was inherently 
susceptible to manipulation prearranged trading and other abuses 
the cftc approved globex last week the new york mercantile 
exchange which trades crude oil and platinum futures and the 
sydney futures exchange of australia have agreed to list some of 
their products for globex trading

president bush making his first appearance 
before congress proposed a 116 trillion budget thursday night 
that would increase money for social programs but freeze pentagon 
spending he promised to work day and night with congress to put 
americas fiscal house in order 
in a primetime nationally broadcast appearance bush proposed 
slashing 26 billion from the defense budget proposed by former 
president reagan to help offset costs of the expanded domestic 
programs 
bush in prepared remarks to the heavily democratic congress 
also voiced his personal support for making puerto rico the nations 
51st state and called on congress to take the necessary steps to 
let the people decide in a referendum 
and he said he would set up a new task force on competitiveness 
chaired by vice president dan quayle saying the most important 
competitiveness program of all is one that improves education in 
america he traced a number of schooling initiatives 
the bush speech was not a state of the union address reagan 
produced one on paper before leaving office last month but it 
stood for one touching upon key foreign policy issues as well as 
the entire range of domestic concerns 
the presidents budget plan which features a oneyear freeze on 
scores of federal programs calls for roughly 5 billion more 
spending than the budget submitted by reagan last month and carries 
out bushs oftstated vow of not seeking any increase in taxes 
he said his offer to freeze pentagon spending was conditioned on 
reaching an overall agreement with congress that included budget 
reforms he proposed that the government go to a twoyear budget 
process rather than one year and asked like reagan before him for 
the power for a lineitem veto bushs first presidential speech 
mixed campaign promises with expressions of budget restraint and new 
overtures toward bipartisanship 
initial reaction from congressional leaders was cordial the 
democratic congress wants to work with this president in every way 
that we can house speaker jim wright dtexas said in a taped 
response to bushs speech that was carried on television networks 
well give him our sincere cooperation that does not mean 
obedience it does mean our honest help and our very best advice 
wright said 
bush reiterated a vow from his inaugural address to extend a hand 
to congress my team and i are ready to work with the congress to 
form a special leadership group to negotiate in good faith to work 
night and day if thats what it takes to meet the budget targets 
and to produce a budget on time 
among bushs major proposals were 
an increase in funding for the space program of 24 billion 
over the current year 
indefinite postponement of three oil drilling leases which 
have raised troubling questions two off the coast of california 
and one in florida which could threaten the everglades 
a 1000per child tax credit for lowincome families and a 
3000 deduction to help defer the cost of adoptions 
the first installment toward 500 million in grants for the 
nations best schools rewards for teachers and an expansion of the 
head start program 
i have said id like to be the education president tonight 
i ask you to join me by becoming the education congress he said 
bush devoted the bulk of his speech to domestic issues talking 
about the expanded programs he had promised during his presidential 
campaign 
but he also said that securing a more peaceful world is perhaps 
the most important priority id like to address 
he said it was a time of great change in the world and while 
the united states should be encouraged by signs of reform in the 
soviet union the kremlin clings to objectives which are still too 
often in conflict with ours 
he promised to vigorously pursue development of a spacebased 
missile defense shield the socalled star wars concept and 
declared that chemical weapons must be banned from the face of the 
earth he also said the united states must persevere in its 
support of anticommunist freedom fighter movements around the globe 
the hands remain extended the sleeves are rolled up america 
is waiting and we must produce together we can build a better 
america bush said 
he noted that he had first entered the house chamber 22 years 
ago when he was sworn in as a freshman congressman from texas 
referring to the chairs behind him where the house speaker and 
the vice president sit bush said eight years ago i sat in that 
chair as president reagan spoke of punishing inflation and 
devastatingly high interest rates people out of work american 
confidence on the wane our challenge is different 
noting the record sixyear peacetime expansion bush declared 
we are headed the right way but we cannot rest 
bush called for a new aggressive push in fighting the scourge 
of drug abuse including a 6 billion budget to fight drugs 
nearly a 1 billion increase over current spending 
let this be recorded as the time when america rose up and said 
no to drugs the war will be waged on all fronts 
borrowing a line from former democratic presidential candidate 
jesse jackson bush said to kids in our cities dont give up 
hope say no to drugs stay in school and yes keep hope alive 
in remarks addressed to his television audience watching 
tonight in your living rooms bush said hold fast to your 
dreams because ultimately americas future rests in your hands 
and to my friends in this chamber i ask for your cooperation 
to keep america growing while cutting the deficit that is only fair 
to those who now have no vote the generations to come 
his budget was vague on exactly where all the money would come 
from to pay for initiatives

president bush called on congress thursday 
night to cut taxes on capital gains whose benefits go primarily to 
people making more than 100000 a year and to enact a new tax 
break for lowincome families 
in a move that could be viewed as violating his nonewtaxes 
pledge the president also recommended an extension of the 3 percent 
tax on telephone service which is due to expire at the end of 1990 
and to eliminate a scheduled reduction in taxes on airline tickets 
and cargo 
he also proposed a 2billionayear tax cut for corporate 
research costs a social security tax increase of about the same 
size on 2 million employees of state and local governments and new 
tax incentives for the oil industry and for parents who adopt 
bush in his outline for building a better america endorsed 
most of the miscellaneous revenue measures that thenpresident 
reagan sent to congress last month but the new president apparently 
abandoned a reagan proposal that would have had the internal revenue 
service charge taxpayers a fee when they call for advice on filling 
out their tax returns 
by far the hottest issue in the revenue package is the proposal 
to cut the capitalgains tax bush added fuel to this longrunning 
debate by claiming that his proposal would not cost the treasury a 
dime but would in fact raise more than 16 billion over the next 
five years but lose 201 billion the following three years 
restoring the capitalgains differential will increase 
entrepreneurial activity and employment paving the way for 
discoveries of new products processes and whole new industries 
bush said 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the taxwriting house 
ways and means committee vowed allout opposition to a 
capitalgains cut 
im not about to tell the wage earners in chicago that they 
should pay a higher tax than stockbrokers rostenkowski told the 
national press club i personally will strongly resist any efforts 
to undo the 1986 tax reform including the return to a 
preferential tax rate for capital gains 
capital gains which are profits from the sale of stock real 
estate and other assets traditionally were taxed at lower rates 
than wages and other income under the assumption that most such 
investments are good for the economy congress repealed that 
preferential treatment in 1986 as part of the price of reducing

president bush proposed thursday to change the 
direction of the federal budget by moving money away from military 
growth and toward social progams that make up his vision of a kinder 
and gentler nation 
the 116 trillion spending plan he sent congress would boost 
federal money in fiscal 1990 for cleaning up the environment for 
aids research for aid to the homeless and for education 
this budget represents my best judgment of how we can address 
our priorities consistent with the peoples view bush said in an 
address to congress there are many areas in which we would all 
like to spend more than i propose but we cannot until we get our 
fiscal house in order 
richard darman the presidents budget director said bush was 
making a very credible start toward the kinder gentler society 
he has said repeatedly he wants 
sen jim sasser dtenn chairman of the senate budget 
committee said the bush administration has signaled an end to 
the defense buildup and has indicated theyre willing to flow some 
defense expenditures into meeting domestic needs like education 
overall the bush plan rests heavily on the foundation laid down 
by former president reagans budget last month 
he embraces reagans call for costcutting in entitlement 
programs including 5 billion from medicare and lesser amounts from 
farm price supports and federal employee benefits 
the bush plan would reject a few of reagans least popular 
proposals such as cutting the school lunch program and imposing a 
new fee for veterans home loans darman indicated 
the vast majority of reagans budget was carried over by bush 
who as part of his nogrowth flexible freeze policy set a 
ceiling for these hundreds of programs roughly equal to what reagan 
proposed but bush appealed to congress to join him in shifting 
money between programs within this group so long as the totals still 
meet deficitreduction goals 
among the reagan proposals lumped into this group are 
terminations of 82 popular domestic programs bushs document 
allowed him to avoid specifically endorsing each one while still 
claiming the overall savings 
bush claimed he met his pledge of no new general tax increase 
but he did propose continuing two taxes that are scheduled to expire 
or decline the 3 percent federal tax on local and long distance 
telephone calls and the 8 percent tax on airline tickets 
the bush budget document says the federal deficit would be 
reduced to less than 911 billion next year just slightly lower 
than the 925 billion in reagans proposal and within the 100 
billion fiscal 1990 limit of the grammrudman law 
the bush white house estimates the deficit in the current fiscal 
year which ends sept 30 will be about 1633 billion more than 
2 billion higher than reagan was estimating just last month 
the new president would trim back his predecessors plan to 
increase military spending faster than the pace of inflation 
instead military outlays of 2982 billion this year would just 
keep up with inflation and increase to 3003 billion that would 
free 26 billion for other programs compared to reagans plan 
bush proposed reducing the tax rate on capital gains to as low as 
15 percent on productive assets held more than two years thats 
less than half the current top capital gains rate he predicted 
that rather than reducing federal revenues as many economics 
predict this move would increase them by 48 billion because the 
rate cut would expand the economy and the tax base 
although many in the democraticcontrolled congress oppose the 
capital gains proposal as a break for the rich that would cost money 
in the long run many favor some areas where bush says he wants to 
put the money 
bush was proposing to increase subsidies for energy development 
and scientific research under the theme of international 
competitiveness among his proposals 
more than 300 million in new tax breaks for the oil and gas 
industry allowing new drilling in selected offshore areas and in 
the alaska wildlife refuge 
restoring a research and development tax credit for business 
urban enterprise zones using special tax breaks to lure 
companies to depressed areas 
expanded support of research and science by endorsing reagans 
support for the space station and shuttle and the proposed 
superconducting super collider physics laboratory 
bush proposes to spend the 515 million set aside by congress 
last year to begin construction of the space station to be in orbit 
in the late 1990s congress had put strings on the money by ordering 
that the new president must first approve its use 
in seeking to make good on his campaign assertion that he is an 
environmentalist bush was promising more spending on the superfund 
program for toxic waste cleanup clean coal technology clean water 
and wetlands programs and a greater emphasis on global 
environmental problems such as the greenhouse effect 
selected domestic programs would be increased as part of his 
kinder gentler nation theme including 
increasing spending on the the head start preschool education 
program by 149 million 
a new merit award program for schools increased subsidies for 
black colleges 
a renewed and expanded 3000 tax deduction for adoption 
expenses 
rejection of reagans proposed 17 billion cut in the medicaid 
health program for the poor 
a child care tax credit of 1000 for lowincome families 
21 million to start a national program for youth in public 
service 
increased spending for the battle against drug abuse 236 
million more than reagan 
bushs budget was released in a manner that discouraged 
comparisons with reagans proposals instead the president decided 
to compare his figures with those of the current fiscal year a 
technique which makes his spending increases look larger because the 
old figures dont factor in inflation 
for example bush claims as his initiatives a 13 percent boost in 
research to find a cure for the aids virus and a 19 percent increase 
in the space program but his figures are the same as reagans 
the bush budget includes the 19 billion cost to taxpayers next 
year of his program to bail out the ailing savings and loan 
industry reagan has proposed 21 billion 
bush embraces reagans plan for upgrading aviation safety and 
adds 350 million to the 14 billion reagan sought for cleanups 
needed at the governments nuclear plants 
he does not touch social security 
bush planned to reveal further details of his spending plans 
later this month and the 193page document released thursday does 
not sell itself as a comprehensive budget it represents the new 
administrations statement of priorities the outline of a 
blueprint for building a better america it says in its preface 
the presidents budget will be modified by the house and the 
senate into a final budget resolution which then serves as an 
overall guide for legislation

president bush called on thursday for quick 
action in congress to combat acid rain and for a reexamination of 
offshore oil drilling projects in several environmentally sensitive 
areas 
bush proposing his first budget to congress said he is 
committed to ending the long debate on acid rain by proposing 
legislation aimed at revising the clean air act to significantly 
reduce industrial emissions that cause the problem the time for 
action has come declared the presidents budget summary 
if were to protect our future we need a new attitude about 
the environment we must protect the air we breathe bush said in 
a nationally televised address 
in his speech bush touched on other environmental issues that 
had been a frequent theme during his presidential campaign 
we must not neglect our parks so i am asking to fund new 
acquisitions under the land and water conservation fund he said 
we must protect our oceans the age of the needle on the beach 
must end he said referring to hospital wastes that washed up on 
beaches in the northeast last year 
the proposed budget sks for 710 million nearly triple last 
years amount in the next fiscal year to develop clean coal 
technology as part of the effort to deal with acid rain which 
damages lakes and vegetation 
but bush suggested some of the most important environmental 
issues go beyond national boundaries to solve those problems he 
announced he will convene an international conference to discuss 
such issues as global warming ocean pollution and the loss of 
tropical rain forests 
the budget also call for 191 million a 43 percent increase for 
research to examine the effects of pollutants on global warming 
through a socalled greenhouse effect 
on offshore oil drilling bush said he remains committed to 
continuing the sale of oil and natural gas leases if they are 
prudent and environmentally sound 
but bush singled out three regions two off the california coast 
and one off the southern florida coast where the administration 
plans to postpone lease sales pending reviews by a special task 
force that is to report to the president by jan 1 l990 
the action is a break from the reagan administration which had 
sought to push ahead with the controversial leases despite 
objections of environmentalists and residents of the regions 
the president said oil and gas lease sales covering 12 million 
acres off the northern california coast which were scheduled for 
later this year would be indefinitely postponed pending the 
environmental review as would a lease sale off the southern florida 
coast 
the sale of leases covering another 5 million acres off the 
southern california coast scheduled for l990 also would be 
reviewed 
the action on the oil leases was immediately hailed by sen pete 
wilson rcalif who said it demonstrates that bush is a man of 
his word because he had promised review of the california leases 
bush also promised to pursue an aggressive hazardous waste 
cleanup effort with increased emphasis on enforcement and action 
against those who dump wastes illegally 
but the budget produced no additional funds for the superfund 
toxic waste cleanup program beyond the 175 million increase 
outlined in the fiscal l990 budget submitted by former president 
reagan last month the superfund program would receive 175 billion 
for the fiscal year 
the budget called however for sharp increases in spending by 
the energy department for cleanup and improved operations at the 
departments nuclear weapons plants 
cleanup costs at the plants for fiscal l990 were placed at 401 
million a 150 percent increase in spending over this year 
the bush budget also calls for 
a commitment to halting ocean pollution 
establishment of a national goal to maintain the countrys 
wetlands 
a promise to increase research into ways to reduce the growing 
volume of garbage

president bush on thursday proposed to hold 
down the exploding medicare spending in fiscal year 1990 while 
offering medicaid services to more poor women and children and 
increasing spending for aids research the homeless and adoption 
services 
bushs spending plan for medicare the federal health insurance 
program for the elderly and disabled runs close to the same course 
as the plan former president reagan proposed to congress last month 
under bushs proposal to congress the cost of the medicare 
program would grow by 8 billion to 925 billion next fiscal year 
a 95 percent increase in a program that has grown an average of 15 
percent per year for the past decade 
the presidents plan would save an estimated 5 billion in 
medicare costs by limiting increases in payments to hospitals 
physicians and other health care providers it also would reduce 
payments to hospitals for new construction and supplemental payments 
to teaching hospitals 
for medicaid the federalstate health insurance program for the 
poor bush restored reagans proposed 17 billion cutback and added 
33 billion to maintain the level of current services under the 
program the increase would boost spending 97 percent from the 
current 343 billion to 376 billion 
costs of the medicaid and medicare programs are among the fastest 
growing segments of the federal budget because health care costs 
have been increasing far faster than the general inflation rate 
bush abandoned reagans proposal to cut medicaid payments to the 
states but he proposed to require states to raise mandatory 
medicaid eligibility for pregnant women and children to 30 percent 
higher than the poverty level up from the poverty level and to 
offset the expansion with cuts in administrative expenses 
ellen nissenbaum of the center on budget and policy priorities a 
nonprofit group that researches policy issues affecting the 
lowincome said the proposed medicaid policies would shift the 
financial burden to the states 
states which administer medicaid would end up having to make 
other cuts in medicaid protection for poor children and their 
families in order to finance bushs medicaid expansions unless 
states were willing to pump significantly more money of their own 
into the program she said 
bush also wants 20 million in fiscal years 1990 and 1991 for 
grants to states with high infant mortality to develop health and 
nutrition programs to combat the problem 
the president proposed no cuts in social security which will 
cost 260 billion in 1990 in january 1990 recipients about 395 
million people some 650000 more than this year would receive a 
costofliving increase estimated at 36 percent 
spending on aids research and educational programs would rise 13 
percent to 14 billion next year 
the president also said a national aids program will be 
established in the public health service to coordinate and 
consolidate aids funding which is now spread among 23 separate phs 
agencies and vulnerable to bureaucratic competition and 
rivalries 
almost 85000 americans have been diagnosed as having acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome since june 1981 and more than half or 
almost 48600 have died the reagan administration said reported 
cases of the fatal disease in this country are expected to reach 
365000 by the end of 1992 with 80000 new cases and 65000 deaths 
projected for that year alone 
bush also addressed his campaign commitment to adoption not 
abortion by proposing a 10 million increase in spending on 
adoption services which would raise funding 78 percent to 138 
million 
in addition the president proposed a tax deduction of up to 
3000 to cover adoption costs that are not reimbursed through other 
programs 
bush also wants to raise spending for the homeless by 29 percent 
from 500 million currently to 645 million next year as part of 
the increase he proposed a 50 million program to help homeless 
families move from welfare hotels to transitional or permanent homes 
and provide services and shelter for the homeless mentally ill
