moslem guerrillas fired a rocket into a 
crowded kabul neighborhood wednesday that killed seven people and 
wounded 21 state television reported 
the television said it landed near a line of people waiting for a 
bus near the mikrorayon district where senior government officials 
live the victims included people waiting at a distribution center 
for scarce flour and cooking oil witnesses said 
guerrillas surround kabul and attack supply convoys creating 
severe food and fuel shortages but have fired few rockets into the 
city as the feb 15 deadline nears for withdrawal of all soviet 
military forces this was the first reported in several days 
soviet military transports fly in hundreds of tons of flour daily 
to help feed the poor in a city packed with 2 million residents and 
refugees but a soviet officer said the flights would end with the 
withdrawal 
a un airlift of food and medicine from pakistan to kabul had 
been expected to start tuesday but has been delayed at least until 
thursday 
col pavel vinokunovsaid 35 soviet air force planes most of them 
giant ilyushin 76 transports have brought 600 tons of flour to the 
capital every day vinokunov who has spent 2 years in afghanistan 
commands the red army soldiers who guard the airport and protect the 
aircraft 
he said the airlift would contine until monday two days before 
the deadline when he and his men will leave the defense of the 
airport to afghan forces and return to the soviet union 
vinokunov would not reveal how many men he commanded but said 
we have enogh to fulfill the task to do the job and then some 
soviet diplomats said privately fewer than 500 soviet soldiers 
remined in kabul 
in moscow the official news agency tass quoted col gen mikhail 
moiseyev military chief of staff as wednesday the last soviet 
soldier would leave afghanistan on feb 14 
the newspaper komsomolskaya pravda said gen b v gromov the 
red army commander in afghanistan would be the last to leave at 
precisely 10 am feb 15 the deadline 
it said he would march across the border bridge at termez and 
make a silent speech to himself for precisely 1 minute and 7 
seconds it did not say whether those were gromovs plans or its own 
speculation 
the kremlin sent military forces to afghanistan in december 1979 
to help combat moslem guerrillas who began fighting after a 
communist coup in april 1978 an estimated 115000 red army soldiers 
were in the country when the pullout began may 15 under a 
unmediated agreement 
in islamabad pakistan un officials said the crew of a 
chartered egyptair transport had refused to make the first flight of 
the un airlift to kabul with 32 tons of supplies and ethiopian 
airlines had agreed to do it 
prince sadruddin aga khan who directs the 11 billion un 
relief and reconstruction program for afghanistan said the united 
nations does not share the apprehension of the airline about the 
safety of kabuls airport and is convinced of the urgent needs to 
be met on the bases of a humanitarian consensus among all those 
concerned 
in cairo the official middle east news agency quoted hassan 
afifi operations director of egyptair as saying flights to kabul 
have been postponed not canceled until security conditions there 
stabilize there was no elaboration 
rene albeck spokesman for the relief program said the chartered 
ethiopian plane would fly from quetta in arid baluchistan province 
about 65 miles from the afghan border in southwestern pakistan he 
said large un storage depots were located there and at peshawar in 
northwestern pakistan and the two cities would be the hubs for aid 
delivery 
an estimated 350000 people living in kabul shantytowns are short 
of food and heating fuel in one of the harshest winters of recent 
years 
long lines form daily for bread the city needs 650 tons of flour 
a day and officials estimate the reserve is enough for only one to 
three months 
the soviet union airlifted 3100 tons of flour to the city last 
month and has said another 12000 tons would be brought in by feb 
15 
vinokunov said the halfway point was reached wednesday 
as he spoke with foreign journalists huge ilyushin jets took off 
and climbed steeply over the mountains that surround kabul spitting 
out dozens of flares to deflect the heatseeking missiles often 
fired by guerrillas 
helicopter gunships also spouting flares circled in a twomile 
radius from the runway in search of guerrilla hideouts in the 
mountains 
until this week the transports carried equipment soldiers and 
soviet civilians home the colonel said but now they return to the 
soviet union empty

the 20yearold jetliner that crashed in the 
azores on wednesday had not been subjected to a high number of 
takeoff and landings but had several problems requiring repairs in 
recent years officials said 
the craft was one of two boeing 707s owned by independent air 
corp of smyrna said al pittman independent president it had 
12500 cycles or takeoffs and landings and less than 50000 hours 
in the air 
jack barker spokesman for the federal aviation administration in 
atlanta agreed that the figures cited by pittman were not excessive 
if properly maintained there should not be a problem because 
of hours or number of cycles other aircraft involved in the news 
have had as much as 50000 cycles a great many more 
asked wednesday night about the planes repair record barker 
said he had not seen the service difficulty reports filed with the 
faa but that the faults found would not be considered a problem 
not if theyve been repaired 
the important thing is that theyre fixed properly he said 
the charter plane crashed on approach to santa maria airport in 
the azores killing the 137 italian tourists who were passengers and 
an american crew of seven the flight was headed from bergamo 
italy to the dominican republic and would have continued without 
passengers to jamaica 
in the azores an island chain west of portugal airport 
dispatcher gualder cordero said there were no radio messages or 
warnings before the plane went down 
pittman said one of the companys two jets lost oil pressure jan 
21 as it flew into denver and required repairs before resuming eight 
to 10 hours later he did not know if the same jet crashed 
wednesday and said of the oil problem dont look for anything in 
that 
barker said independent air corp was fined 18000 in 1984 but 
he could offer no further information about that faa enforcement 
action before thursday 
records at the faas mike monroney aeronautical center in 
oklahoma city show seven service difficulty reports on the plane 
over the past six years spokeswoman bobbie mardis said 
they included two reports in january 1983 an engine shutdown due 
to turbine failure and failure of a switch in the main landing gear 
filings in july 1987 showed problems occurred with an electrical 
transformer powering a lavatory heater altimeter and airspeed 
monitor problems caused a return to atlanta for replacement of a 
static line a left inboard keel beam extension fitting was found 
cracked on the fuselage and the right fitting was found broken 
the seventh report filed in december indicated that during 
inspection a mechanic noticed a crack in the no 2 engine first 
stage fan duct further inspection revealed a inch crack the 
report said adding that the duct was replaced and the plane was 
returned to service 
im not aware of the service difficulty reports so id have 
to say they are fairly minor independent coowner orien dickerson 
said we have the same stringent monitoring program as delta 
american and all the major airlines every time you go into a major 
maintenance check youll find some amount of corrosion 
pittman identified six of the victims as leon daugherty 41 of 
nashville the captain sammy adcock 36 nashville first officer 
jorge gonzalez 34 rex ga the flight enginner and flight 
attendants yvette murray 26 of marietta ga angela urban 24 
west palm beach fla helen ziegler 45 warner robins ga and 
sabrina cromarty whose age and hometown he did not know 
the remaining flight attendant a woman was not identified 
pending notification of relatives 
independent air has 100 employees 65 of whom are crew members 
pittman said 
generally everybody knows everybody else in a company this 
size he said its like losing a member of your family we are 
deeply saddened there have been some tears here today in shock 
the boeing 707320b which could seat 186 passengers was 152 
feet 11 inches long with a wingspan of 145 feet 9 inches the 
aircraft was first introduced by boeing in 1961

the us justice department said it 
would not help prosecute ferdinand marcos and would seize his 
property if manila agrees to an unacceptable deal for his return 
home it was reported wednesday 
teodoro locsin jr publisher of the philippine daily globe and 
president corazon aquinos speechwriter said the warning was 
relayed to mateo caparas chairman of the presidential commission on 
good government 
the us attorney general has made it clear total discretion 
cuts both ways if philippine officials have total discretion to 
undo years of american efforts to secure justice for the filipino 
people us officials have equally total discretion to make 
filipinos pay for tolerating such officials locsin said 
caparas arrived in the united states last week supposedly to 
determine whether the ousted president is prepared to negotiate in 
order to come home from exile in hawaii 
the philippine government says marcos and his associates 
embezzled up to 10 billion president corazon aquino has said the 
government will not discuss his return until he gives back the money 
caparas trip to the united states confirmed wednesday by mrs 
aquino raised speculation that the aquino administration was 
prepared to negotiate a deal aquino said caparas was only to meet 
with marcos representatives but not negotiate 
us officials said a hasty settlement of philippine charges by 
manila could undermine american efforts to prosecute marcos 
the justice officials from the us attorney generals office 
insisted that whatever terms and conditions caparas negotiates a 
plea of guilty by either marcos or his wife should be 
nonnegotiable locsin wrote 
locsin quoted caparas as saying us officials threatened to 
withhold evidence of marcos alleged secret bank accounts received 
from the swiss government 
they also warned that the us attorney general could take 
possession of marcos properties in new york which the philippine 
government hopes to sell and dispose of them as he deems fit 
locsin added 
the properties are estimated to be worth 300 million 
marcos and his wife imelda have lived in hawaii since a 1986 
popular uprising toppled his 20year administration marcos has been 
hospitalized since jan 15 with heart and lung ailments and has 
asked to return to die in his homeland 
last october the marcoses were indicted on us federal 
racketeering charges alleging they stole more than 100 million and 
stashed much of the money in american banks 
locsin said us attorney charles labella of new york told 
caparas that us officials could also agree to a pleabargain that 
would be unfavorable to manila 
in seven days the us cases could be dropped and all us 
legal constraints on marcos return to manila would evaporate 
locsin said the philippines would then have no leverage to deal 
with marcos either to secure a financial restitution or even a 
promise of good behavior from him 
efforts to contact caparas in new york were unsuccessful because 
he refused to return calls from the associated press 
in another development an excabinet minister said he deposited 
into a swiss bank account more than 45 million in kickbacks from 
japanese companies for marcos according to court documents obtained 
tuesday 
the seven japanese companies he named all denied the allegation 
baltazar aquino marcos former public works and highways 
minister made the allegation in four statements submitted friday 
during deposition hearings in connection with 39 civil suits against 
the former president

irans leaders are trying to woo tens of 
thousands of skilled exiles home to help with the massive task of 
postwar reconstruction but few emigres seem ready to risk it 
parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani considered the most 
powerful figure in iran after ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and 
others are moving to encourage political and social liberalization 
in part to entice educated iranians home 
rafsanjani declared at a recent tehran rally if we give up 
some of the shortsightedness some of the crude aspects which 
were the requirements of the early stages of the revolution and 
which we do not need today we will attract them back 
at least 2 million iranians including scientists technocrats 
managers and academics fled after khomeinis 1979 islamic 
revolution toppled shah mohammad reza pahlavi and during the 8year 
war against iraq 
they included many young men dodging military service who were 
often smuggled out of the country illegally monarchists leftists 
and disaffected middle class businessmen 
unofficial estimates indicate that only about onefifth of 
iranians sent abroad to complete their studies have returned home 
iran badly needs technical expertise for reconstruction 
few of the exiles ranging from former government and 
revolutionary leaders to shopkeepers and students contacted in 
several countries by the associated press showed any desire to 
return to iran now 
abolhassan banisadr the islamic republics first president who 
fled to france in 1981 amid a bloody purge of liberals and leftists 
said i dont think these appeals will have any result these days 
there are executions by the hundreds and all the reactions to 
the appeals has been negative 
shahpour bakhtiar the last iranian prime minister under the 
shah who is also living in france said no exile in a financial 
position to return would do so the way things are at present 
security is more precarious the law less respected than at 
any time since the shahs days the way the leaders of the 
country treat internal opposition does not inspire trust 
as long as the government and i dont think there is one is 
not able to respect the rights of people i dont think that anyone 
who has a certain value a certain effectiveness will have a 
desire to return 
mohammad vavood a spokesman for the opposition mujahedeen 
khalq or peoples holy warriors in cologne west germany said 
i know of no one whos planning to return it would be suicide to 
go back to iran now 
abol ghassem kargar 67 who runs a supermarket in los angeles 
now after fleeing through turkey said when reached while back in 
turkey if the mullahs go id go back and so would 80 percent of 
the exiles i know 
kargar said he fled iran in 1983 after revolutionary guards 
killed his son sina along with 130 women and 440 men in a tehran 
prison when they staged a protest demanding better conditions 
he said his son a graduate of the university of california at 
los angeles was a civil engineering professor at tehran university 
when he was arrested by the revolutionary guards for allegedly not 
including islamic teaching in his classes 
kargar said the guards later seized two private girls schools he 
owned and ran in tehran for 20 years along with the family villa on 
the caspian sea 
he was in istanbul seeking to take his sister fatima 55 to the 
united states his three daughters who now live with him in 
california had fled iran via pakistan and afghanistan after he got 
out

the setting is peaceful on a lake 
surrounded by douglas firs but peace is far from the minds of the 
war veterans who meet here to unload decades of violent and fearful 
thoughts and feelings 
for many its the first time since the war that theyve felt 
free to cry 
some of these people havent felt in years said anne 
gregory manager of nurses for the posttraumatic stress disorder 
program at the veterans hospital at american lake herself a 
vietnam veteran 
the fact that some of these people are still sane is 
remarkable ptsd is treatable but it takes time gregory said 
an estimated 470000 of the 314 million vets who served in 
vietnam suffer from ptsd and 80 percent of those never have sought 
mental help said american lake director ray scurfield his is one 
of 14 relatively new programs in this country trying to help ptsd 
victims three percent of its participants served in korea and world 
war ii the rest in vietnam 
in the company of other vets and a professional staff of 23 that 
includes 13 veterans men who never quite left the war behind tell 
of sleepless nights flashbacks guilt over having killed guilt 
over having survived uncontrolled anxiety and rage and the 
isolation they feel 
holding hands they ride in huey helicopters in maneuvers similar 
to those commonly used in the war the sound of the rotors and rush 
of wind was enough for one to tearfully recall his last flight in a 
huey a trip that ended in an ambush and the deaths of 18 of the 35 
men in his squad 
some go on an outward bound trip and push their limits in rapids 
in search of new perspectives on their abilities and their lives 
many vets are hearing for the first time that its human to feel 
what they feel and that anyone who has experienced severe trauma 
the holocaust for example or even major earthquakes can feel the 
same way 
and its the first time many have let go the birth of a long 
period of healing forgiveness learning to live with memories 
trusting themselves and others and hoping for the future 
theyre digging things out of me here that i didnt even know 
were issues said dan collins 42 of tacoma you look at 
somebody and see them blown to hell and theyre not there 
its a convenient way not to make friends because im afraid 
of them dying i avoid people for that and other reasons 
thats the nice thing about this place they confront you on it 
and you have to face whats going on inside of you 
scurfield said any victim of severe trauma can develop chronic 
symptoms that can include intrusive imagery numbing helplessness 
fear that leads to rage fear that leads to grief anger against 
authority and the system inability to control emotions and 
actions broken relationships and work histories depression 
anxiety hypervigilance and sleeping disorders 
they sometimes express those symptoms and other times avoid 
expression altogether as they probably did at the time the trauma 
took place this leads to physical and emotional isolation and 
confusion over personal responsibility selfworth relationships 
work even play 
the 11week program at american lake begun in 1985 has served 
350 so far and has an eightmonth waiting list applicants must 
have served in a war zone have received some counseling already 
and be drug and alcoholfree it costs the veterans administration 
107 per day per patient 
participants learn about controlling anger anxiety and stress 
and about substance abuse and ptsd they also examine prewar 
experiences that may have contributed to their war reaction 
warzone trauma and their postwar years 
they even look at the benefits of trauma intense comradeship 
emotional and spiritual insights and heightened sensitization to 
lifes horrors and to political behavior scurfield said 
by going back to the wound you finally realize that you have 
to feel the pain the grief the loss before the wound is actually 
healed said leonard horst 42 of sequim youll always have 
the scar but at least you have acceptance and forgiveness 
all are encouraged to attend outpatient counseling for six months 
to three years to consolidate gains made while in the program 
scurfield says failure to do that can easily mean backsliding and 
renewed isolation 
vets listen carefully when scurfield explains how their anger 
probably stems from fear how they had to go to vietnam at a time 
when they would have been undergoing a lot of change anyway and so 
were especially vulnerable how theyre the only ones who can change 
the crazy life patterns 
the rage is justified but you still need to let go of it 
scurfield said if how youre going to feel or what youre going 
to do is determined by someone else youre not in control im 
not saying dont fight you must not let the symptoms control 
you open a valve and release some of it without hurting yourself 
the understanding and definition of the disorder continues to 
evolve how successful american lake and ptsd treatment are is 
anybodys guess without a better followup system and more 
coordination among the 14 programs said scurfield a doctor of 
social work who did psychiatric work in vietnam 
a lot more money and programs are needed especially in the west 
scurfield testified before congress last summer special emphasis 
should be placed on professional support for veteran selfhelp 
groups in geographically isolated areas where many choose to live 
because of low fixed incomes 
scurfield lays the delayed response in identifying and treating 
ptsd a disorder professionals now believe has always existed among 
trauma victims to naive psychology trends rightwing beliefs that 
common knowledge of ptsd would undermine the countrys ability to 
defend itself and concerns over the immense potential financial 
strain of treatment 
in a recent survey sent to 180 american lake graduates and 
answered by 85 a majority had been helped in selfesteem 
relationships and understanding they have the responsibility and 
ability to change but a significant minority reported no real 
change in depression and anxiety relationships and intrusive 
symptoms 
i definitely needed another tuneup and more time said 
richard fairfield 39 of rural northeast utah it took me 20 
years to get as screwed up as i was if they had helped me 20 
years ago i wouldnt be here the program should be longer 
ten percent of participants have returned once scurfield said 
despite its admitted weaknesses steve petty a va social worker 
in loma linda calif and a member of a congressionally mandated 
ptsd committee says american lake is considered on the cutting edge 
of treatment 
these people know whats going on said fairfield when i 
wake up at 3 am drenched in sweat and have to talk theyre 
there 
its the only program with a special support group for children 
of vietnam vets and its the only one that incorporates the 
helicopter rides 
i was trying to make sense out of nonsense said jeff 
russell 36 of olympia i felt i was the only person who felt 
that way 
this program gave me a chance to work on issues and stop 
from hitting bottom i have to pick myself up and live

closed down by president ferdinand e 
marcos in 1972 and reopened just over a year ago the philippines 
congress now is swept up in scandals 
hardly had the dust settled on a scandal involving firearms 
imports when members of the house of representatives were facing 
charges of trying to corner the export of coconuts to taiwan 
the senate also has come under fire for deciding to use 
taxpayers money to buy 35 foreign luxury cars for each of its 23 
members and certain staff 
just before the coconut scandal broke in late january columnist 
neal cruz of the daily globe wrote that the rubberstamp congressmen 
during marcos time look like saints compared to the members of 
this congress 
first some gunrunners in the house of representatives import 
hundreds of highpowered automatic firearms for the protection of 
congressmen and the rest for the lucrative black market he 
added just as the public heaved a collective sigh of relief that 
the senators are not involved in this caper comes the revelation 
that all 23 senators have ordered new cars 
the coconut scandal exploded jan 25 when the chairman of the 
philippine coconut authority claimed at least 12 congressmen were 
pressuring his organization to grant them exclusive rights to export 
4500 tons of fresh coconut to taiwan 
jose romero said the congressmen from four coconutgrowing 
provinces south of manila were insisting that the authority not 
only restore a quota system it had recently scrapped but also to 
partition the coconut export quota among themselves 
he said that until last year his agency awarded the entire quota 
to a group of filipino exporters but decided three months ago to 
stop the practice becuse of complaints from other groups the move 
was also in line with the governments policy of deregulation 
the congressmen led by rep leonardo guerrero claimed they 
simply were trying to protect the interests of small coconut farmers 
in their provinces from middlemen they claim had monopolized the 
export in the past 
guerrero chairman of the house subcommittee on edible crops 
denied romeros charges and accused him of receiving bribes from 
middlemen 
the uproar over the firearms scandal is not over even though the 
200member house cleared two congressmen of wrongdoing in the 
importation of more than 600 israelimade uzi and galil automatic 
rifles 
defense secretary fidel ramos said the imports lacked permits 
from his department customs officials said other regulations were 
broken 
nevertheless after a closed special session the house ruled 
that the two congressmen who brokered the importation did not commit 
any improprieties the house voted however to turn the weapons 
over to the military in response to public opinion 
reps rodrigo gutang and renato unico both retired military 
officers said the guns were to have been paid for by the 
congressmen with their own money they said the legislators needed 
the weapons to defend themselves from rising crime and threats from 
communist rebels 
as the gun controversy raged someone leaked the senates 
decision to buy 35 new cars the public uproar was immediate with 
most comment accusing the senators of callousness in light of 
widespread poverty 
callers to television and radio programs threatened to stone 
senators in their new cars one woman offered cash rewards to people 
who actually did so 
a few senators dropped the idea following the uproar but senate 
president jovito salonga and other senators insist that public 
officials have a right to have official vehicles 
other scandals to hit the house involved pork barrel funds and 
other allowances 
last year house speaker ramon mitra handed an envelope 
containing 20000 pesos 1000 to a member of the congressional 
press corps on the eve of the legislatures christmas recess 
some newspapers immediately assailed the move as an attempt to 
buy off the press mitra said however the money was given in lieu 
of a traditional blowout congress gives reporters after passing 
the national budget 
the money was eventually spent by mitra on a dinner for the 
entire press corps

ashland oil inc entered a no contest plea 
tuesday on two federal environmental law violations stemming from 
the january 1988 diesel fuel spill 
us district judge gustave diamond accepted the plea after a 
sixhour hearing he set a sentencing hearing for march 6 
under federal law a no contest plea while not an admission of 
guilt is a conviction 
theyll face the same criminal penalty as a person who is found 
guilty said acting us attorney charles sheehy 
in ashlands case that amounts to a maximum fine that could 
include 200000 for each of the two counts 25000 for each day of 
the violation and twice the amount of damages to persons and 
property 
a federal grand jury in september indicted ashland on two 
misdemeanor counts of violating the clean water act and refuse act 
two months later the company filed a brief seeking dismissal of 
the charges ashland cited false testimony given by allegheny county 
fire and police officials concerning the companys efforts to obtain 
permits to erect the tank 
in late november two of the top county officials involved were 
forced to resign because of their testimony a third was suspended 
sheehy opposed acceptance of the plea during the hearing saying 
it lends credence to the view that a double standard of justice 
exists 
sheehy also noted in his brief that such pleas have been opposed 
by the us justice department as a way to skirt moral 
responsibility 
ashland still faces 18 civil lawsuits as a result of the jan 2 
1988 spill at its floreffe terminal on the monongahela river the 
sudden collapse of a diesel storage tank sent about 713000 gallons 
of fuel into the river creating a slick that disrupted water 
supplies to thousands of customers in western pennsylvania west 
virginia and ohio

a guerrilla commander stood at the 
border checkpoint on the western end of the legendary khyber pass 
grinned and told the visitor from pakistan welcome to free 
afghanistan 
scores of men heavily armed and dressed in everything from 
tribal clothing to captured soviet helmets and battle jackets 
busied themselves with various tasks around the post 
one commander a sovietmade kalashnikov assault rifle slung over 
his shoulder shouted orders through a bullhorn 
the commanders said they were trying to set up a rudimentary 
administration at torkham to handle basic government tasks 
guerrillas were organizing shelters and offices in the 
administration block immigration building and customs 
this place is now under islamic government commander nabib 
mohammed said 
it appeared to be a relaxed government at least for the moment 
men at the posts paid little attention to steady streams of 
merchants fellow guerrillas and local residents crossing the border 
in both directions 
a signpost pointed the way to kabul the capital of afghanistan 
about 140 miles to the west 
loudspeakers strung along the road blared moslem services from 
the town mosque the wailing incantations echoed in the barren brown 
hills around torkham 
inside administration buildings pocked by gunfire small groups 
of guerrillas drank tea and talked torkham changed hands several 
times before government forces abandoned the area last month 
there was much fighting but now this place is ours mohammed 
said 
captured field guns armored personnel carriers and trucks were 
parked near the buildings green islamic flags fluttered from army 
trucks that roared up the road from time to time full of fighting 
men 
a partially burned painting of a soviet soldier and an afghan 
comrade clasping hands in friendship had been used to patch a hole 
in a damaged building soviet grain sacks were nailed over holes in 
the immigration office 
guerrillas who captured torkham had scrawled their names on the

a senate panel tuesday listened to secretly 
taped conversations in which the chairman of the navajo nation told 
a real estate broker how to cover up the thousands of dollars the 
broker paid him for helping arrange purchase of a ranch by the tribe 
the broker byron t bud brown taped the conversations in 
cooperation with investigators for the senate select committee on 
indian affairs and testified with a grant of immunity before the 
committees special investigative unit 
brown said he arranged for businessman tom tracy to buy the 
491000acre big boquillas ranch in arizona for 262 million from 
tenneco west co and then immediately sell it for 334 million to 
the navajos brown a real estate broker also received a 750000 
commission from tenneco 
brown said the 72 million profit was shared by tracy brown and 
peter macdonald chairman of the navajo tribe 
brown told the panel he paid macdonald 25000 to cover a bank 
loan and gave him 50000 in cash and an expensively equipped bmw 
automobile as his share of the profits 
he said macdonalds reaction to the idea of flipping the 
ranch to the tribe for the higher price was to smile and say i 
assume that i will be taken care of 
i said certainly brown told the panel 
brown said the dollar amount was not arrived at immediately but 
later macdonald came to him and said he needed 25000 to pay on a 
bank loan the money was supplied through tracy brown said 
macdonalds loan money request was followed by one for the bmw 
which also was supplied through tracy brown said 
following sale of the ranch brown said he personally paid 
macdonald several 5000 increments in 100 bills the payments were 
arranged by macdonalds son peter macdonald jr who called brown 
when his father needed money and use the word golf balls as a 
code for money 
sale of the ranch raised eyebrows locally and press publicity was 
followed by an investigation by the local us attorney brown said 
when the probe began the senior macdonald wanted to cover up the 
fact that he had received the 25000 bank loan payment and the bmw 
the real estate broker said 
in a recording of a conversation made nov 22 1988 the senior 
macdonald told brown he should say that his son peter was the 
recipient of the 25000 and the car 
when brown talked to the junior macdonald on dec 14 1988 the 
tape has the son saying were all three of us three musketeers 
shoulder to shoulder in reference to browns question as to 
whether he would stick by the story with his father and brown 
on monday the junior macdonald an attorney told the committee 
under immunity that he went along with the scheme because i love 
my father 
the senior macdonald has not testified and committee staff said 
no agreement to grant him immunity has been reached furthermore 
his part in the ranch land sale is under investigation by a federal 
grand jury and a movement has begun among the navajos to recall him 
as chairman 
however a letter was released tuesday from a navajo task force 
saying various individuals have implicated and levelled charges 
against the navajo nation without substantiating their allegations 
with facts such malicious allegations are attempts to discredit the 
integrity of the navajo nation its people government and 
sovereignty 
the letter called for representation by the navajo nation before 
the committee for rebuttal 
the letter said the navajos understood that the hearings were 
primarily to be into alleged misconduct by the bureau of indian 
affairs 
while corruption may exist in any government or at any level 
within the navajo nation as it may in washington dc the 
committees nearly exclusive focus on selected abuses is creating 
the public impression that corruption at navajo is universal the 
letter said 
the hearings began jan 30 will continue through this week and 
for several days later this month 
sen dennis deconcini dariz who chairs the special 
investigative unit said arrangements to have members of the navajo 
task force testify in the latter part of the month would be made

on the duke university campus its almost 
but not quite as big as blue devils basketball dance superstar 
mikhail baryshnikov is making his dramatic stage debut playing a 
cockroach in an adaptation of franz kafkas metamorphosis 
the play has been a hot ticket ever since the box office opened 
in december the first two days 200 to 300 people waited in line 
for as long as four hours to buy tickets now the threeweek run at 
the 640seat reynolds industries theater is sold out 
basketball is the major activity down here but i would tell 
you that from a cultural and artistic standpoint this has been the 
biggest thing to hit the campus in a long time says ron kumin 
administrative director of the duke drama program 
nearly 30 percent of dukes 10000 students will see the show 
before the end of its run feb 25 kumin estimates tour bus 
companies are bringing in theatergoers from neighboring states and a 
sizable press contingent has arrived from as far away as chicago 
and dallas to see the play before it opens on broadway in march 
the object of all this hoopla is the 41yearold baryshnikov so 
far he has kept his appearances confined to the stage a news 
conference scheduled for his arrival last week was temporarily 
postponed due to rehearsal restraints and there have been no 
interviews 
in his only published comments about the production the 
russianborn dancer told connoisseur magazine that metamorphosis 
was a scary project its just putting my neck under the ax for 
people to say stick with dancing 
so far he has not had to worry rehearsals which began the 
first week of january in new york have gone smoothly according to 
production staff members although one actor in a minor role in the 
sixcharacter play was replaced 
the other actors have been impressed with baryshnikovs work 
misha is so totally modest and unassuming says laura 
esterman who plays his mother in metamorphosis hes new to 
acting on stage with words so hes very open extremely cooperative 
and anxious to learn 
baryshnikov has an exacting teacher in steven berkoff who wrote 
and directed this version of the kafka story about a young man who 
gradually turns into a bug and whose family tolerates rejects and 
finally destroys him 
berkoff an english actor director and playwright already has 
made his mark on new york theater this season with a critically 
acclaimed and radically reworked production of shakespeares 
coriolanus starring christopher walken and irene worth 
metamorphosis was first performed in london in 1969 and there 
have been nearly a dozen other versions since last year roman 
polanski starred in a paris production which baryshnikov saw and 
liked 
the new york production which will cost some 460000 is 
produced by lars schmidt who presented the show in paris and roger 
l stevens former head of the kennedy center in washington it will 
have a top ticket price in new york of 4250 the highest for any 
drama now on broadway 
duke students were given a chance to work on metamorphosis 
some 200 responded to an ad in the chronicle the campus newspaper 
and 44 were chosen to help with everything from props to publicity 
to stage managing to transportation 
its been pretty hard to remember youre a student says 
jolie gabler one of two students assigned to coordinate 
transportation for the actors and production staff its been 
pretty hectic 
baryshnikov declined the services of a chauffeur preferring to 
drive himself around town he doesnt like anyone to make a 
fuss gabler says 
they will anyway he was the center of attention saturday at a 
party following a black tie benefit performance of the play for the 
duke drama department 
but the attention wont affect baryshnikovs performance the 
work of the other actors or the audiences says esterman 
if were interesting theyll watch us if were boring 
theyll watch misha and sometimes theyll watch both she says 
but hopefully theyll just be watching the play

legend has it that king louis xvi lost his head over 
a pigs foot no surprise in this culinary capital where 
gastronomy ranks as fine art and eating is a sacred ritual 
so it was fitting that a pigs foot cooked to perfection from a 
recipe dating to the french revolution was the first offering in an 
11course feast prepared by six famous french chefs and served up 
monday night to 280 guests at the pre catalan restaurant in the bois 
de bologne 
the culinary extravaganza called if 1789 was cooked for me 
was part of the revolutions bicentennial celebration invited 
guests included show business celebrities cabinet ministers and 
members of the diplomatic corps 
guests were greeted by costumed footmen and lasses in lowcut 
dresses with bustles and they dined off recreations of havilland 
china from the period 
the food was fit for kings yet each course carefully researched 
by food historians claude quetel philip and mary hyman was 
standard middleclass fare 200 years ago 
we were very careful to choose simple dishes that people 
actually ate quetel said in an interview 
the dinner he said was a way of subduing the passions still 
unleashed by the french revolution 
thats one sure way to get the french to agree on the right or 
the left the french know good food from bad he said 
back in 1789 bourgeois parisians dined on a stew of boiled 
capon a dish that fell out of favor when american turkeys were 
introduced 
joel robuchon chef at the restaurant jamin in paris selected 
the finest specially raised ninepound birds at 12 a pound but 
roasted them inside a crust of sea salt instead of boiling them 
that way you can be sure that all the breasts arent 
overcooked or the legs undercooked robuchon said 
also popular in the late 18th century was the hearty garbure 
a version of corned beef and cabbage that later became one of 
frances greatest specialties before nearly disappearing altogether 
the creation of alain dutournier chef at le carre des feuillants 
in paris this delicacy from the gascogny region in southwestern 
france was one of the most appreciated dishes of the evening 
its definitely my favorite it has taste it has body said 
guy legay chef at the ritz hotel in paris 
quetel said the recipe for the cabbage soup was unearthed in a 
19th century cookbook cuisinier durand its author had cooked 
for years for a marquis but lost his job in the revolution and 
opened his own restaurant in nimes 
in 1789 in the south of france fresh fish too small to be sold 
at market were poached in lemon juice olive oil garlic and 
anchovies by the fishermen who hauled them in prepared by alain 
ducasse of the hotel de paris in monte carlo la matelote du 
poissonier is considered to be the revolutionary ancestor of the 
provencal bouillabaisse 
stuffed carp was inspired by a 1739 recipe and prepared by 
antoine westermann chef at le burerehiesel in strasbourg 
freshwater fish appeared on the finest tables until the 19th 
century when saltwater fish came into favor 
jean bardet chefowner of a restaurant in tours which bears his 
name said he cooked and ate dozens of pigs feet before getting 
the centuriesold ste menehould recipe right 
i had a recipe from 1758 naming the different spices used 
cinnamon the shell of fresh nutmeg coriander and cloves bardet 
said the problem was that there was no mention of proportions so 
i spent two weeks trying different combinations i ended up gaining 
seven kilos 15 pounds 
louis xvi according to legend was undone by his penchant for 
pigs feet fleeing the revolution in 1791 he insisted on stopping 
in ste menould a small town near reims long enough to savor the 
house speciality of the soleil dor inn thats where his foes 
caught him and he was returned to paris where he was guillotined in 
1793 
master baker lionel poilane concocted a special bicentennial 
bread made from spelt flour a coarse wheat flour that was a staple 
in 1789 and now a rarity 
even though the french of yesteryear consumed many fewer desserts 
than today gaston lenotre resuscitated five from the past 
including an unusual carrot tart with a crunchy caramel topping 
provencal pastry balls were so hard that some guests joked they 
would have made great revolutionary cannon fodder 
the culinary extravaganza was sponsored by the 230yearold 
champagne house henri abele 
champagne was not popular during the revolution but it was louis 
xvis favorite drink and he is said to have consumed a bottle at 
each meal even in the final days before his beheading

sakharov a physicist and winner of the 1975 nobel peace prize 
is in italy to accept academic and civic honors in his second 
foreign trip since being freed from seven years of internal exile in 
1986 
sakharov told craxi something absolutely needs to be done by 
western europe to free members of the karabakh committee according 
to margherita boniver a parliamentarian and the socialists foreign 
relations spokeswoman 
all 11 committee members were arrested in december for allegedly 
fanning ethnic tensions in the southern soviet republic of armenia 
but have not been formally charged 
the committee has spearheaded a campaign by armenians to gain 
control of nagornokarabakh a predominantly armenian enclave of the 
neighboring republic of azerbaijan 
clashes between armenians most of whom are christian and 
azerbaijanis who are predominantly moslem broke out last year in 
the two republics over the armenian demands for annexation of 
nagornokarabakh

each others republics that nearly 300000 fled their homes tass 
quoted him as saying 
less than a sixth of the refugees have since returned home 
according to vasko previous reports had placed the death toll from 
the violence at more than 70 with 200000 refugees 
sakharov called the imprisonment of the karabakh committee 
members a step backward in view of the decision made in vienna 
last month at the conference on security and cooperation in europe 
to organize a human rights conference in moscow in 1991 mrs 
boniver told the associated press 
the two also discussed this springs soviet parliamentary 
elections in which sakharov is a candidate and the new forces of

for helping improve the plight of soviet dissidents the italian

their responsibilities for the dangers of global nature that can 
derive from science like those of nuclear war or ecological

prank and the innkeeper isnt taking any chances with it this time 
after the class of 37 graduated the sign graced the rooms of 
succeeding princeton students during world war ii it was stored in 
a coal bin in new york then in a garage in batavia ill in 1954 
it turned up in short hills and a volunteer group restored it in 
east aurora ny 
now the class of 37 plans to return the 2by5foot 
handpainted sign to the entrance of the 200yearold inn during a 
ceremony feb 18 
its great to be able to have our original sign back after 52 
years innkeeper nelson zager said tuesday he said about 100 
members of the original 300 in the class are expected to return for 
the event 
the sign will be better secured this time around 
lest any modernday prankster become inspired to repeat 
princeton history our engineers have assured us that the formerly 
permanent sign is now truly permanent thanks to modern alloy 
and an electric alarm system zager said

the breakfast sausage to be served at this 
weeks governors conference on agriculture isnt exactly kosher in 
michigan but no one is complaining 
a 1952 state law listing all the ingredients retailers are 
allowed to stuff into sausage includes honey eggs and garlic but 
not cherries 
but its not exactly illegal either said robert jason a 
regional supervisor for the agriculture departments food division 
in traverse city when the law was made in 1952 nobody ever 
thought to put fruit in sausage 
he said state regulators are looking the other way until someone 
can amend the states sausage laws 
ray pleva a butcher who developed the cherry pecan sausage that 
will grace the tables at the conference has sidestepped the sausage 
law by having a wholesale sausage company stuff his links 
federal law which regulates sausage wholesalers allows fruity 
fillers

investigators looking into last weeks train 
collision and explosion say that no hand brakes were set on any of 
the 48 runaway rail cars that rolled backwards for nine miles and 
slammed into three locomotives 
edward dobranetski chief investigator for the national 
transportation safety board said it is not known yet why the hand 
brakes were not used and the human factor is being closely 
scrutinized 
mike lemm montana rail link trainmaster in helena said 
preliminary tests show the trains air brakes a separate braking 
system that operates from within the locomotive were working 
properly but more tests are under way he said 
twentyone cars derailed in the collision and one containing 
hydrogen peroxide exploded shattering windows up to two miles away 
and hurling debris hundreds of yards 
no serious injuries were reported but the explosion knocked out 
power to much of the city of 37000 and forced evacution of about 
2000 people when the temperature was about 30 degrees below zero 
the train crew had detached the cars from the lead locomotive to 
exchange it with another one containing a better heater the federal 
railroad administration reported in its initial investigation last 
thursday the day of the explosion 
on monday dobranetski said the cars were separated from the 
locomotives after the lead engine lost power 
he also said hand brakes are to be set if the train is on a steep 
grade to serve as a backup to air brakes the portion of track where 
the train was disconnected is classified as mountain grade he 
said adding that it appears the train crew violated railroad 
regulations by failing to set the hand brakes 
investigators are still trying to determine whether 
recordbreaking cold played a part in the accident 
weather has an effect on any device dobranetski said but 
we are not sure yet what role it played in this accident

house speaker jim wrights defeat in the 
congressional pay raise controversy leaves him weakened but in no 
immediate danger of being knocked out of his job say lawmakers of 
both parties 
there will be some lingering resentment said democratic rep 
tim penny a fourthterm lawmaker from minnesota and one of only a 
handful of democrats to criticize the speaker publicly for his 
handling of the payraise fight 
theres going to have to be some fencemending over the next 
few months before this thing is put behind us penny said 
but democratic leaders in the house rallied around wright after 
his strategy of winning a pay raise without a vote collapsed 
members came to the river stuck their toes in and said 
uhuh added democratic caucus chairman william gray dpa 
jim wright can lead you to the river but at some point you have 
to get your feet wet 
while penny criticized wright for advocating the pay raise 
others complained privately that the speaker displayed too little 
leadership in the face of opposition to the 45500 increase 
others said he failed to consult with fellow democrats in time to 
avert the overwhelming vote tuesday on the house floor that killed 
the raise and opened the possibility that there will be no raise for 
the foreseeable future 
still there was some afterthefact sympathy for the man who not 
only carried the weight of the house but also of the judiciary the 
executive branch and the senate on the payraise issue 
we cant hide behind one man weve got to go out and make an 
appeal to the american people said rep vic fazio dcalif a 
leading advocate of the raise we simply had too many people 
laying back letting someone else do the heavy lifting 
democratic whip tony coelho of california said any obituaries on 
wrights speakership were premature 
i was around when oneill was definitely out he said in 
reference to the former house speaker who endured a string of 
setbacks early in president reagans term in office but went on to 
serve the longest continuous term of any speaker 
ive said repeatedly the speaker is not in trouble should not 
be in trouble and could not be in trouble coelho added the 
only way he could be in trouble is if there were another candidate 
to oppose him as speaker 
a batch of foley for speaker buttons appeared at the capitol 
on tuesday apparently an effort by a conservative group to rub salt 
into wrights wounds but majority leader thomas foley dwash 
repudiated the suggestion 
wrights lead role in the payraise battle brought him political 
heat unmatched in his controversial twoyear tenure as speaker 
which includes a pending ethics case 
significantly much of that heat came in his economically 
depressed home state of texas and in his congressional district in 
fort worth where the idea of a 45500 raise was even harder to 
justify to the public than in much of the rest of the country 
an aide to wright john mack likened the speakers position to 
that of a reluctant leader of a cattle drive we signed up for 
kansas but we didnt want to go there now everybodys shooting the 
trail boss 
some heat was felt as well by house minority leader robert 
michel rill a hometown newspaper article carried criticism of him 
for privately favoring the pay raise but publicly voting against it 
republicans predicted that the cost to wright of the pay fight 
would be a period of extreme caution in which the speaker would be 
forced to stay in the background and avoid the kinds of risky moves 
that have been his trademark

the congressional budget office is offering an 
assortment of deficit reduction proposals that contain potentially 
large savings but most have little appeal to lawmakers 
in its annual menu of suggested ways to slash the federal 
budgets perennial imbalances the nonpartisan cbo on tuesday 
advanced scores of ideas that are frequently discussed and just as 
consistently swatted down in the face of vocal criticism 
eliminating the deductibility of state and local taxes would 
raise 41 billion for federal coffers next year a 5 percent 
national sales tax which probably could not go into effect until 
fiscal 1991 would collect 82 billion that year applying the 
medicare payroll tax to individual wages above 48000 would bring 
in another 31 billion the cbo said 
each of these would help meet deficit reduction goals for the 
next few years for fiscal 1990 which begins oct 1 the 
grammrudman law sets a deficit target of 100 billion which the 
white house says will require 27 billion in savings 
but president bush has pledged to not raise taxes and even 
members of congress who say new taxes are necessary prefer to talk 
about levies on items such as gasoline alcohol and tobacco 
other options described by cbo have attracted equally little 
enthusiasm 
eliminating next years scheduled costofliving increase for 
recipients of social security federal railroad civilian and 
military retirement and veterans compensation programs would save 
106 billion next year and 69 billion over five years but few 
politicians are willing to tangle with social security recipients 
and veterans two vocal lobbies 
other possibilities outlined by cbo include 
raising 200 million next year by limiting interest deductions 
that may be claimed by corporations that borrow to take over other 
companies 
limiting deductions on business meals and entertainment to 50 
percent of their value rather than the current 80 percent to raise 
18 billion next year 
boosting federal taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel by 12 cents 
per gallon to raise 12 billion next year or imposing a 5 per 
barrel oil import fee to produce 77 billion 
doubling the 16 cents tax per pack of cigarettes to raise 29 
billion and raising 47 billion by increasing federal taxes on a 
750 milliliter bottle of wine from 3 cents to 54 cents and on a 
sixpack of beer from 16 cents to 63 cents 
restraining the growth in spending for the star wars 
antimissile research program to only 5 percent per year saving 
880 million next year 
having us allies pay the salaries of their natives working on 
american overseas military bases and pay for utilities and other 
maintenance costs on the bases a 25 billion savings in 1990 
eliminating 15000 military personnel in response to the 
intermediaterange nuclear weapons treaty between the united states 
and the soviet union a 110 million savings 
increasing the medicare deductible for doctors services from 
75 per year to 200 per year for a 15 billion savings 
raising the 1 percent fee the veterans administration charges to 
guarantee home loans to 175 percent producing 290 million in 
savings 
saving 51 billion by lowering the target prices used to 
determine farmers deficiency payments by 5 percent 
canceling development of nasas planned space station a 390 
million savings next year

the frigid push of arctic weather may have 
damaged winter wheat in parts of the central and southern plains 
says a government report 
but winter wheat in the northern plains and the corn belt 
benefited from a protective layer of snow during the week of jan 
30feb 5 as the huge arctic system caused temperatures to plummet 
in kansas winter wheat was mostly poor to fair said the 
report released tuesday extreme cold temperatures late in the 
week may have caused widespread winterkill but the extent of the 
damage was still unknown 
cold weather greatly reduced greenbug activity in the 
oklahoma winter wheat crop but raised the possibility of winterkill 
in the western area of the state the report said 
severe cold also put heavy stress on livestock in the northwest 
and great plains the low temperatures and wind were especially hard 
on newborn calves and lambs and abovenormal losses were expected 
in some areas the report said 
on the chicago board of trade grain and soybean futures on 
tuesday closed about unchanged from the day before analysts said 
the markets had anticipated some wheat winterkill because of the 
cold 
moreover forecasts for more snow in the great plains have had a 
dampening effect on commodity markets 
there is a growing realization among traders that the odds of a 
backtoback crop adversity in the midwest are extremely small 
said richard feltes of refco inc a chicagobased commodities 
brokerage firm 
the agriculture department has been saying for months that a 
repeat of last years heavy drought losses is unlikely although 
some areas are still far below normal in soil moisture 
norton d strommen the usdas chief meteorologist says 
precipitation from now until the end of april can further improve 
soil moisture levels and yield potential of wheat areas in the 
great plains 
also he said earlier this week timely spring and summer rains 
along with favorable temperatures will be the key to crop prospects 
this summer and there is little correlation between drought 
indicators this winter and prospective crop yields for 1989 
looking at other crops and field activities the report said 
snow and low temperatures limited plowing and fertilizing in the 
plains and corn belt land preparation for spring planting continued 
in the southeast but was limited by rain in parts of the delta 
land preparation for the 1989 cotton crop continued in arizona 
and california 
tobacco plant bed preparation and seeding continued in the 
southeast georgias tobacco plants were in mostly good condition 
plant bed preparation was under way in virginia 
rain was needed in floridas citrus areas groves have abundant 
new foliage and bloom buds the early orange harvest was very active 
abnormally warm dry weather continued throughout floridas major 
vegetable areas plant development was ahead of normal

american farmers and exporters should change 
the way they view australia and start thinking about down under as a 
land of sales opportunities says jim parker the us agricultural 
counselor in canberra 
instead of always thinking of australia as an exporting 
competitor us exporters should remember that the united states 
supplies about 15 percent of australias agricultural product 
needs parker said 
australia is a tough competitor in some of the worlds commodity 
markets wheat and beef are major examples but parker said there 
is no reason australia and the united states still cant trade with 
each other 
currently australia imports about 15 billion worth of 
agricultural products with the united states providing only 250 
million of the total mostly lumber tobacco soybeans and soybean 
products horticultural products and processed food 
we have room to grow but in order to grow we have to start 
thinking of australia as a market and not as a competitor parker 
says in the current issue of agexporter magazine published by the 
agriculture department there are about 16 million people in 
australia they appreciate good food and have the money to afford 
it 
about 86 percent of australians live in cities and only about 6 
percent of the nations work force of 7 million people are farmers 
convenience foods offer a large sales potential he said 
there are more dualincome families in australia parker 
said with both the husband and wife working neither is thrilled 
with the idea of cooking a big meal at the end of a long day like 
americans they want something tasty fast and easy 
also he said us groups are working to introduce and promote 
american beef at firstclass hotels in all of australias major 
cities parker said that a third of australian diners now request 
us beef when ordering steak off the menu 
parker said us lumber has a potentially bright future in 
australia despite efforts to increase domestic softwood lumber 
production demand continues to grow

transportation secretary samuel skinner says he 
will seek strong measures against air terrorism when he attends an 
international meeting in montreal next week but will oppose steps 
that put us airlines at a business disadvantage 
skinner at his first news conference as secretary on monday 
rejected the idea of public warnings of terrorist threats he also 
announced that he would replace federal aviation administrator alan 
mcartor who he said has asked to return to private business 
the montreal meeting of the council of the international civil 
aviation organization feb 1516 was called to find ways to improve 
international standards for passenger baggage and cargo security 
top transportation officials from the 33 council member nations have 
been invited 
skinner did not give details of the steps the united states would 
seek at the montreal conference but said worldwide safety measures 
are needed he said restrictions should not apply only to us 
airlines 
us and british officials called for the session after the 
explosion of pan am flight 103 that killed all 259 people aboard and 
11 other people on the ground in scotland dec 21 authorities say a 
bomb blew up the plane and they are still considering several 
possible perpetrators methods and motives 
families of flight 103 victims called monday for mcartors 
resignation for faa failure to ensure safety of the 
frankfurtlondonnew york flight and warn passengers of threats 
against the flight 
if we were to shut down airlines every time there is a threat 
we will allow terrorists to disrupt the economy of not only this 
nation but every nation in the world skinner said 
skinner said mcartor had done a good job in many aspects but 
has said he wants to step down mcartor had indicated he wanted to 
leave prior to the security concerns raised by the destruction of 
flight 103 
on other topics 
skinner said he will decide within a few days whether to allow 
lower mileage standards for the automobile industry than the 275 
milespergallon average scheduled to go into effect for 1990 
models the industry claims the tougher standard would be too costly 
and force car makers to produce smaller cars the public wont buy 
the current standard is 265 miles per gallon 
he said mass transit systems should be weaned away from federal 
funding but the government cannot just cut off the spigot of 
federal funds skinner headed the mass transit system in northern 
illinois before becoming secretary 
the new secretary rejected for now the idea of reorganizing the 
department as proposed by his predecessor james burnley but said 
he would try to make the present setup work and might look at 
reorganization later

health experts say defeat of the federal pay 
raise will further hinder efforts to recruit and retain scientists 
for the governments battle against aids 
food and drug administration commissioner frank young told a 
senate panel that scientists who are paid about 60000 annually at 
his agency can leave for salaries of four or five times that 
testifying to the senate labor and human resources committee 
hours before congress voted tuesday to deny itself a 51 percent pay 
raise young said the fda was in much the same predicament as the 
national institutes of health which said recently it had been 
unable to recruit a senior scientist in the last 10 years 
the pay raise measure that congress rejected included increases 
of 40000 to 59500 for toplevel officials in the executive 
branch among those would have been scientists for the fda and nih 
the commissioner said the agencys drug review division where the 
number of applications for new aids drug research had doubled was 
especially hard hit by the shortage of scientists 
for example he said the fda hadnt anticipated that the number 
of applications for aids drug research would double that there 
would be annual instead of biannual inspections of the nations drug 
supply or that there would be problems with inspections of condoms 
and rubber gloves 
were in a difficult position of knowing how to prepare a 
budget young also said because we cant anticipate two years 
ahead as the federal budget process requires 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections 
as of jan 2 the centers for disease control in atlanta said 
there were 32311 aids cases reported in the united states in 1988 
a 57 percent increase from a year before

leaders of the legal profession contend that 
federal judges are the biggest losers in the congressional vote to 
scuttle hefty pay raises for top government officials 
while members of congress can still supplement their income 
with speechmaking fees and political committee contributions 
judges are left with salaries that have decreased in real dollars 
by 30 percent over the past two decades american bar association 
president robert raven said tuesday 
the recommended increase for federal judges did little more 
than restore lost ground said raven a san francisco lawyer 
john j curtin jr a boston lawyer who in august will become 
president of the 350000lawyer aba said the lost pay raise for 
judges will destroy their morale 
the fallout on the federal judiciary is going to be 
devastating curtin said adding that his organization will lobby 
president bush and congress to raise the pay of federal judges only 
had the raise taken effect today salaries for federal trial 
judges like those of members of congress would have climbed from 
89500 to 135000 a year 
the annual salaries of federal appellate judges would have risen 
from 95000 to 145000 supreme court justices from 110000 to 
165000 and chief justice from 115000 to 175000 
congress rejection of the pay raise quells a political 
firestorm over raising congressional salaries but foments a serious 
problem within the federal judiciary raven said 
he said that inflationeroded pay for federal judges flouts the 
wisdom of our constitution and the lifetime judicial appointments 
it provides 
inadequate and decreasing pay forces all but independently 
wealthy judges to forgo their life tenure and market their 
experience and training on the bench in the more lucrative arena of 
private law firms raven said 
salaries of federal judges have been raised six times this decade 
and now are 24 percent higher than they were in 1980 but the cost 
of living as measured by the consumers price index has risen by 46 
percent over the same period 
since 1969 a period in which many federal judges say their 
buying power has dropped by a third the cost of living has risen 
by 227 percent 
chief justice william h rehnquist had called the pay raises 
essential if we are to continue to attract from the financially 
greener fields of private practice the sort of experienced and 
capable lawyers whom we want as judges 
during house debate on the pay raise tuesday rep vic fazio 
dcalif emphasized the problem for judges there are supreme 
court justices who make less than their clerks the day after they 
the clerks go into private practice fazio said 
raven said fazios comment was not far off and noted that 
some law firms offer starting salaries of 76000 a year 
certainly a starting lawyer who receives two years credit for 
having worked as a law clerk immediately is making more than a trial 
judge raven said

dealmaking developer donald trump has found 
something else to put his name on a new board game similar to 
what else monopoly 
trump appeared tuesday with representatives of milton bradley co 
at a trump tower news conference to unveil trump the game 
trump is somewhat like parker bross monopoly in that the 
player with the most money wins but the trump t has replaced 
monopoly game pieces like the shoe the thimble and the iron and 
the highest trump denomination is 100 million instead of 500 
and unlike monopoly the new game features pictures of trump the 
man on the money game board playing cards and the box 
its a much more sophisticated game than monopoly trump 
said i like to play monopoly ive played it all my life in 
many forms 
capitalists ages 12 and older are invited to share in the 
exciting highstakes risktaking i get to do every day if you 
are clever aggressive and cut the best deals you can earn millions 
even billions of dollars just remember play to win or not 
at all 
trump said his proceeds from the 25 game which will hit 
toystore shelves this spring will go to causes like cerebral

in killing its pay raise congress may have 
disabled the automatic pilot it devised to get a raise without 
voting for one something like the autopens that sign letters here 
without human intervention 
people concerned with the issue said it now may be impossible for 
congress to get an increase unless the constitution is amended to 
take the decision away from congress 
and they say it may be impossible to get a constitutional 
amendment through state legislatures unsympathetic to washingtons 
wants 
in fact said political scientist r kent weaver of the brookings 
institution the only state legislators likely to support a 
constitutional amendment are those who want to go to congress and 
then it would be used against them 
the constitutional change most often discussed would create an 
independent body to fix the governments top salaries with congress 
barred from playing any role 
but the talk show hosts of american would have a field day with 
that too says former rep william ratchford dconn who was a 
member of the presidential commission that recommended the 51 
percent raise roundly rejected tuesday in the capitol 
radio talk show hosts mounted an antiraise campaign that helped 
motivate congress to abandon plans to let the pay boost take quiet 
automatic effect at midnight 
the first time a constitutional amendment worked said 
ratchford there would be an effort to repeal the amendment 
nonetheless argued william m agee another commission member 
we need to take it out of the political arena there has to be a 
way this issue is depoliticized agee is chairman and chief 
executive officer of morrison knudsen corp of boise idaho a big 
shipbuilding engineering and construction outfit 
an amendment appears necessary because the constitution seems to 
say that fixing its pay is a congressional responsibility it says 
members shall receive a compensation for their services to be 
ascertained by law 
former senate republican leader howard baker of tennessee once 
proposed altering the constitution to let the supreme court fix 
congressional pay he has said congress is institutionally 
incapable of setting its own salary 
critics asked who would set the courts pay and when baker said 
congress would the idea was rejected as a classic case of 
backscratching 
well it leaves the country with a problem said former sen 
charles mcc mathias rmd also a member of the commission the 
problem is that we postponed it a pay raise for the top levels in 
government for too many years and postponing it further is simply 
going to aggravate the problem 
the reason we recommended 50 percent is because the small 
percentage increases were not taken year by year and that 
difficulty will only grow bigger as long as we wait he added 
one idea afloat in the aftermath of tuesdays vote called for 
letting congress vote for a pay raise for the new congress the one 
that will be elected in november 1990 
it wouldnt work said weaver opponents would have two 
years to knock it down they could attach a repeal to every bill 
that came along 
another solution mentioned by mathias agee and weaver is to 
break the custom by which congressional salaries rise in lockstep 
with executive and judicial salaries 
they suggested that congress could give judges and government 
officials a raise without taking one itself that solution always 
has been rejected by congressmen who felt their worth was no less 
than a judges or a bureaucrats 
if they could delink themselves and say ok we will not vote 
for a raise for ourselves but we will allow one for the executive 
branch and the juduciary to go through it seems to me that would be 
a great act of statesmanship said agee then they could try to 
pass say a 20 percent increase for themselves

congress paid itself between 6 and 8 per 
meeting day for the first 67 years of the republic and giving 
itself a raise has always been a contentious matter notes the 
commission on executive legislative and judicial salaries the 
panel that recommended a nowrejected 51 per cent boost 
the commission noted that rep morris k udall dariz once 
observed that ever since the countrys founding debates over 
congressional salaries have produced more selfrighteousness and 
more passionate oratory and more posturing and more nonsense 
than almost any other subject 
the first attempt came in 1816 when congress voted to fix a pay 
scale of 1500 per session the uproar was so great the measure was 
repealed the next year 
lewis condict a member from new jersey offered this commentary 
at the time 
no embargo no news newspaper editors were in danger of 
starvation and for want of other prey they pounced upon the 
compensation law and like peters brown loaf it has served them 
for beef and mutton custard and plum pudding it was standing dish 
for months and was served up in every possible shape boiled and 
roasted stewed and fricasseed 
devoured by the demagogues of faction it has been reissued 
from their pestiferous jaws at the tippling houses and dram shops 
highly seasoned with falsehood and misrepressentation and this is 
called public sentiment and public opinion this is instruction 
from our constituents which the representative is bound to 
observe 
and in 1873 after congress increased its pay by 50 percent 
from 5000 to 7500 the democratic convention adopted a 
resolution stating we condemn and denounce the salary grab and 
all congressmen democratic or republican who voted for it or have 
not renounced all share in plunder seized

national security concerns are plaguing the 
irancontra trial of fired national security council aide oliver 
north as jury selection in the case draws to a close 
norths lawyers said tuesday the government is proposing that 
they be required to provide advance notice before disclosing certain 
categories of classified information the proposal was rejected jan 
30 the day before the trial started but the government is now 
attempting to resurrect it the lawyers said 
us district judge gerhard a gesell who said last week that he 
doesnt want security gurus running norths trial hasnt ruled 
on the governments latest request 
it was understood that independent counsel lawrence walsh is 
making the proposal on behalf of intelligence agencies with national 
security concerns 
north is accused of shredding evidence and lying to congress and 
the attorney general in an attempt to cover up the irancontra 
affair including the diversion of profits from the reagan 
administrations secret iran arms sales to the nicaraguan contra 
rebels 
intelligence agencies object to gesells ruling three weeks ago 
that north may introduce a wide range of classified information 
without prior court order if it is relevant to his defense 
that includes classified information tending to show that norths 
intent and purpose was not to violate the law or that any 
statement made by a government witness during the trial is false or 
misleading said gesells order 
us intelligence agencies claim those categories are too broad 
said government sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
gesell also said north will be allowed to present classified 
material if any exists to establish that thenpresident reagan 
thenvice president george bush or anyone at the national security 
council directed or openly encouraged or condoned the coverup 
gesell issued the order jan 19 but it remained under seal until 
tuesday 
meanwhile norths lawyers moved to stop the trial on grounds 
that the jury selection process which had been under way for six 
days failed to meet legal requirements 
the number already qualified stands at 45 but gesell indicated 
he wanted a larger pool as insurance 
the jury selection and service act of 1968 mandates a random 
selection process but gesell has introduced a nonrandom 
criterion said the filing by north lawyer brendan sullivan 
gesell passed over all prospective jurors who said they had 
watched listened to or read accounts of norths 1987 immunized 
testimony to congress in which he detailed many of the activities 
for which he is now accused of crimes 
sullivan claimed the judges procedure was a violation of the 
1968 law he said it can be remedied by excusing all prospective 
jurors who said initially they hadnt been exposed to the north 
testimony but indicated during open court questioning that they had 
been 
many of those approved for the pool by gesell said they were 
vaguely aware of the televised hearings but paid no attention to 
them 
however north lawyer barry simon has objected to nearly all of 
the prospective jurors on the grounds that they have been exposed to 
norths 1987 testimony

the budget president bush presents to congress 
this week will be a revision of ronald reagans outgoing plan but 
it wont come close to the rewrite job reagan did on his 
predecessors farewell spending plan 
reagan set his first budget director david stockman to work 
with a vengeance on the lameduck spending plan outgoing democratic 
president jimmy carter submitted in january 1981 
that budget was completely dismantled later stockman was to 
trade his budget ax for a pen and do a dismantling job of another 
sorts on reagan and his former colleagues 
reagan went before congress on feb 18 1981 with a spending 
overhaul he boasted was a program for economic recovery it 
combined the deepest cuts in domestic spending ever proposed a 
large acrosstheboard cut in income tax rates and a boost in 
military spending 
by contrast bushs overhaul amounts to a little tinkering here 
a little adjusting there to a budget that seemed custommade for 
his modifications 
where stockman went through the carter budget cutting item after 
item bushs budget director richard g darman went through the 
reagan budget gingerly adding money to item after item 
darman wasnt exactly covering hostile territory he helped put 
some of those program reductions in the reagan budget in the first 
place apparently knowing full well hed later be penciling in 
increases for bushs kinder gentler society 
a little fancy budgetary footwork and a proposal to hold 
military spending increases at the rate of inflation will enable 
bush to assert in his budget address on thursday that hes making 
good on those campaign promises for new initiatives for education 
the homeless the war on drugs and environmental cleanup 
darman is one of the few senior white house officials who fared 
well in stockmans 1986 book the triumph of politics 
his was the only office in the white house where you found a 
whole table stacked with serious books that the occupant had 
actually read stockman wrote of darman then a white house 
assistant 
i came to admire his hardheaded cogent and zestful approach 
to political strategy stockman wrote 
reagan promised a cut in taxes and a balanced budget by 1983 or 
1984 bush is promising not to raise taxes and to reach a balanced 
budget by 1993 with a socalled flexible freeze 
reagan obviously didnt come near a balanced budget in fact 
the annual budget deficit tripled during his presidency something 
reagan always blamed on congress 
now its bushs turn and many economists claim his proposals 
wont come close to balancing the budget either with or without a 
flexible freeze 
theres actually been the equivalent of a flexible freeze in 
place for the past several years with the growth of federal 
spending roughly matching the rate of inflation but few seem to 
have noticed 
furthermore bush plans to use many of the same economic 
assumptions that reagan plugged into his budget and which the 
congressional budget office and most private analysts claim are far 
too rosy 
these include a projection of economic growth of over 3 percent 
out through 1994 of a drop in shortterm interest rates to 3 
percent over the same period and a fall of inflation to under 2 
percent 
the calculations are important because if interest rates are one 
percentage point higher than estimated it costs the treasury and 
increases the deficit 11 billion for each percentage point that 
growth lags behind the pluggedin projection 24 billion is lost 
stockman claimed he came upon a cruel realization in his five 
years as director of the office of management and budget the 
budget gap couldnt be closed except by a dictator 
house speaker jim wright dtexas had a more fanciful way of 
taking care of the nations troubled finances 
its all been settled he said emerging from a white house 
meeting with bush on the budget peggy noonan will write the 
budget 
ms noonan is the speechwriter who penned both bushs convention 
acceptance speech and his inaugural address and who gave him his 
two most widely repeated lines a kinder and gentler nation and 
1000 points of light

ten years ago washington scored a diplomatic coup 
by establishing ties with communist china while beijings relations 
with the soviet union were anything but cordial 
us officials say they do not expect mays planned sinosoviet 
summit the first such meeting in 30 years to produce a similar 
strategic shift in the superpower security equation 
they say soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs bear hug in 
beijing with chinese leader deng xiaoping will not be a diplomatic 
setback for the united states whose commercial and academic ties 
with beijing are steadily improving 
the americans have ample reason to be confident 
china has made it clear there will be no backtracking to the 
1950s when beijing was a junior partner in moscows bid to lead a 
unified and expanding communist bloc 
foreign minister qian qichen in a statement on summit 
preparatory talks last week stressed chinas independent foreign 
policy of peace and said the expected normalization of 
chinesesoviet relations should not prejudice their respective 
relations with other countries 
gorbachev presented his appeal to end the years of mistrust 
between the communist giants in a 1986 speech that offered 
compromises on territorial disputes the soviets later cut troops in 
soviet ally mongolia and along the border 
the chinese have slowly responded to the soviet overtures and 
they have rejected gorbachevs proposal for an asianpacific 
conference on regional security which would give moscow more say in 
regional affairs 
instead the chinese have actively sought to improve relations 
with thailand and other nations of southeast asia and the southern 
pacific partly to counter soviet links to vietnam and its designs 
for a greater presence in the region 
china also remains firmly committed to the west for trade aid 
and technology 
soviet trade with china is now 10 times the 1981 figure of 260 
million but that pales with chinas 12 billion trade with the 
united states last year and more than 3 billion us investment in 
chinese industry 
japan provides more than 1 billion in loans to china annually 
and had bilateral trade worth 156 billion last year 
china last year sent 445 students and scholars to the soviet 
union there are more than 30000 chinese studying in the united 
states 
except for the brief honeymoon after the chinese communists came 
to power in 1949 relations between asias two largest nations have 
traditionally been shaky territorial disputes go back to the days 
of czarist russia 
after a brief border war in 1969 the soviet hegemonists 
became chinas no 1 enemy and more than 1 million troops massed on 
each side of the 5000mile border 
even as the summit approaches china continues to view the soviet 
ardor for rapprochement with suspicion and caution 
when visiting soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze talked 
effusively last week of a complete normalization of relations 
chinese deputy foreign minister tian zengpei balked at the word 
complete 
i dont want to use any adjectives he said 
relations have already improved dramatically in recent years 
between china and the soviet bloc nations of eastern europe china 
and mongolia have also begun to restore longstrained ties 
now that moscow and beijing are talking they may cooperate more 
in ending the 36year stalemate on the korean peninsula where they 
are both allies to north korea and in resolving the conflict in 
cambodia where they back opposing sides 
the two sides have begun talks on easing military tensions along 
the border 
although they face vastly different problems the soviet 
purveyors of perestroika or economic restructuring can learn much 
from chinas travails of inflation and shortages after 10 years of 
economic reforms 
china which has lagged behind in political reforms is watching 
soviet flirtations with democracy 
shevardnadze spoke of greater exchanges in trade science 
controlling the environment and exploring outer space 
barter trade across the border is booming tourist exchanges have 
begun and next year the second transsiberian railway a line 
through western china first envisioned in the 1950s is to be 
completed 
sovietchinese relations have reached this point not 
automatically and not by chance shevardnadze said both sides 
wanted it to happen

the head of a us group the fbi says is a 
propaganda arm of the kremlin has been charged by federal 
authorities with trying to hide 17000 he allegedly received from a 
soviet communist party affiliate 
alan thomson 57 executive director of the national council of 
americansoviet friendship was released on a 100000 personal 
recognizance bond after arraignment in federal court in brooklyn 
new york before us magistrate john caden he did not enter a plea 
the council has chapters in 25 states and has organized 
ussoviet tours and such events as the signing of the peoples 
peace appeal at the united nations according to a 1987 fbi report 
called soviet active measures in the united states 
the oneparagraph federal indictment dealt only with the currency 
charge and did not refer to the propaganda activities alleged by the 
fbi 
active measures are a form of intelligence including 
disinformation through which one power seeks to discredit another 
or to build up its own image through covert activities 
according to the fbi the americansoviet council was founded by 
the communist party of the united states in 1943 and operates as a 
soviet front group which provides the soviets with an excellent 
conduit to promote its active measures campaigns meet with us 
persons of influence spot and assess us persons for recruitment 
operations and influence certain groups of activists in the us 
peace movement 
thomson contacted by telephone at his manhattan office declined 
to discuss the indictment or the allegations of his links with the 
soviet communist party 
i am under federal indictment said thomson he confirmed 
that he had been arrested but on the advice of counsel i am not 
going to say anything further 
the indictment charges thomson with trying to evade bank 
reporting requirements by having the 17000 deposited in a buffalo 
bank in two transactions of less than 10000 each deposits over 
10000 must be reported to the government 
thomson was indicted by a federal grand jury in buffalo where he 
allegedly had another person make the deposits at goldome federal 
savings bank an fbi statement said the other person was not 
identified 
these funds were provided to thomson in moscow by a soviet 
official of the ussr society for friendship and cultural relations 
with foreign countries the statement said 
in having two deposits made of less than 10000 each thomson 
avoided an inquiry from the bank which would have caused the bank to 
report the source of that cash deposit the fbi statement 
said it did not say when the transaction occurred 
the charge carries a maximum penalty upon conviction of five 
years in prison and a 250000 fine 
a us expert in soviet active measures roy godson of the 
national strategy information center said the arrest was the first 
he knew of concerning such soviet activities in the united states 
the fbi report said that the ussr society for friendship and 
cultural relations with foreign countries is controlled by the 
international department of the central committee of the soviet 
communist party the head of the international department is 
valentin falin formerly the chief of the semiofficial soviet news 
agency novosti and onetime soviet ambassador to west germany 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is general secretary of the 
300member central committee which maintains a large secretariat 
adjacent to the kremlin from which it runs party affairs 
according to the fbi report on thomsons organization soviet 
direction of the ncasf is channeled through the union of soviet 
societies for friendship and cultural relations with foreign 
countries with ultimate authority resting with the international 
department 
soviet representatives of the union are in regular contact 
with ncasf officials and direct the ncasf to conduct activities to 
support soviet active measures campaigns according to the fbi 
report 
soviet defectors such as former kgb agent stanislav levchenko 
have testified that the soviet friendship societies work closely 
with service a of the soviet kgb intelligence organization in 
running disinformation campaigns 
fbi agents arrested thomson on tuesday morning at his brooklyn 
home bureau spokesman joseph valiquette declined to provide 
details including why thomson would have sought to conceal the 
source of the money 
a woman who answered the telephone at the manhattanbased council 
said it was a privately funded organization that sponsors trips to 
the soviet union by childrens and trade groups and maintains a 
small film and book library 
we inform the public of the work of the soviet union said 
the woman who declined to give her name were nothing but a 
small organization and we dont deal with anything illegal 
asked about the charges against thomson she said im sure all 
this stuff is going to fly by its just nonsense as usual

an ethics czar whose rulings would have the 
force of law is needed to stiffen and standardize a welter of 
federal rules regulations and policies against conflict of 
interest according to members of a presidential commission 
the ethics laws in government now are about like the roman 
empire when caligula was using small print in high places to 
confuse the public im confused former attorney general griffin 
bell told president bushs ethics commission at its first meeting 
tuesday 
bell who is vice chairman of the eightmember panel was among 
the members who embraced the idea of establishing the ethics czar 
we need a judge landis said panel member lloyd n cutler 
who was white house counsel to president jimmy carter and one in 
congress as well 
cutler referred to us district judge kenesaw mountain landis of 
chicago who was named the first commissioner of major league 
baseball in 1920 after members of the chicago white sox threw the 
1919 world series landis quickly assumed wide powers including 
banning some players from the game for life his firm action was 
credited with cleaning up what had become known as the black sox 
scandal 
no final recommendations were made at the first meeting of the 
commission which has just one month to propose to bush legislative 
and administrative changes needed to improve federal ethics 
enforcement 
as the group debated which issues to address bell complained 
that like the sumptuary laws in the 12th century federal ethics 
rules apply differently to different people depending on whether 
they serve in congress the executive branch the judiciary or the 
military 
some people can do things and other people cant do the same 
things bell said but no one knows how to act we should get 
everyone the same rules if we can 
we need a czar said the panels chairman former federal 
appellate judge malcolm r wilkey adding that some congressmen he 
has consulted with made the same suggestion 
wilkey said the czar should have the authority to enforce the 
rules and to give advice thats legally binding on the 
congressional side there ought to be a similar institution an 
independent authority outside 
other members compared an ethics czars advisory function to an 
internal revenue service program which issues advisory letters to 
businesses and individuals who request guidance on specific tax 
questions that arise in situations not clearly addressed in any tax 
statute 
bell wondered whether the military would want its own czar and 
whether the house and senate would accept the same czar 
but later he said a czars the only way itll ever be solved 
we need someone like landis with real power and prestige it 
wouldnt work if there were too many because it wouldnt be 
prestigious enough 
but if there was one you could go and get advice that would 
stand up you could get a judge to take the post a lot of judges 
would like that job 
outlining the wide review to be undertaken wilkey said the 
commission staff is preparing a chart comparing how the executive 
branch congress and the judiciary handle the same ethical 
questions no such document now exists in the government he said 
were not likely to come up with any brilliant new ideas 
wilkey said this is a wellplowed field the problem is some of 
the furrows run in different directions maybe we can straighten 
them out 
during an initial discussion of restrictions on government 
employees who return to private enterprise the commissioners agreed 
that some version of restrictions which now apply only in the 
executive branch should be extended to congress and the judiciary 
they agreed to study whether a oneyear ban ought to be placed on 
dealings by former judges with their old court and on dealings by 
former members of congress with the chamber in which they served 
morton halperin of the american civil liberties union however 
pointed out after the meeting that the federal office of government 
ethics has said that existing postemployment restrictions do not 
apply to the president and vice president because only the 
constitution can set the qualifications for election to federal 
office 
so halperin said there might be objections to applying them to 
members of congress without amending the constitution one panel 
member former new mexico sen harrison h schmitt agreed that was 
an issue the group would have to discuss further before proceeding 
with this recommendation 
the members also expressed support for allowing scientific and 
technical people more latitude to give advice in their areas of 
expertise than is allowed lawyers whose work involves cases which 
are usually narrower and shorter than large military procurement 
efforts 
the united states will build only one new class of submarine 
between now and the end of the century said former undersecretary 
of the navy r james woolsey he said a sonar or submarine expert in 
the government could not get a job in private enterprise without 
having something to do with that 
if they dont know what they can discuss in the lunch room for 
two years after they leave the government they just wont come into 
the government in the first place woolsey said

pop idol michael jacksons surprise visit 
to an elementary school still scarred by a deranged gunmans 
murderous rampage was so thrilling that one child couldnt even 
remember her last name 
it was kind of neat to see after what the school has 
experienced said ron teague 36 who helped organize the 
cleveland elementary school pupils for jacksons lightning visit on 
tuesday the children were just ecstatic they treated him like a 
brother 
i think theyll remember this for a long time said stockton 
unified school district spokesman john klose 
jackson also dropped in at san joaquin general hospital where 
two youngsters were still being treated the two were among 30 
wounded on jan 17 when 26yearold patrick edward purdy returned 
to his old elementary school and opened fire on the school yard with 
an assault rifle killing five children before committing suicide 
at the hospital jackson wearing a dark militarystyle jacket 
with red epaulets but without his trademark glittering glove spent 
a few minutes with vann sa 7 and long keo 6 
it was not what i would call a dialogue said hospital 
spokeswoman sharon booker but five to seven minutes with michael 
jackson what can you compare it to 
vann sa was listed in fair condition and was expected to remain 
in the hospital for another week long keo was released later in the 
day 
school officials werent sure the visit was on until a few hours 
beforehand the hospital didnt know for sure until an hour before 
jackson arrived 
hundreds of people assembled outside the school on the chilly 
morning hoping for a glimpse of the superstar but jackson who 
arrived in a white limousine was whisked into the school through a 
back door 
he visited classrooms where kindergarten first second and third 
grade pupils were gathered then stopped at an assembly of fourth 
through sixth graders no reporters or photographers were allowed to 
watch as jackson met with the children 
he made a grand appearance said teague all the children 
were smiling 
he just smiled and thats it said 6yearold lanisha who 
added that she was so flustered over michaels visit she couldnt 
remember her last name elevenyearold hannah schardt who attends 
another school came with her mother 
he just made a peace sign and left right away after about five 
seconds she said he just kind of said hi and nodded 
the visit came a day after city council unanimously approved an 
ordinance outlawing possession or sale of assault rifles like the 
ak47 purdy used in his rampage los angeles city council on 
tuesday unanimously approved a similar ban 
purdy wearing combat fatigues slipped into the schoolyard as 
children were playing at midday recess and opened fire with his 
semiautomatic weapon firing more than 100 shots 
the stockton ordinance makes possession of assault guns a 
misdemeanor and carries a 500 fine and a maximum six months jail 
sentence it takes effect in seven days after which any 
semiautomatic weapon found in the city would be confiscated and 
destroyed opponents said they would appeal before then

an experimental brain operation to treat 
parkinsons disease has produced moderate improvement for some 
victims but not the miracle that an earlier report suggested a 
researcher said 
all the patients in our group have said they felt it was 
worthwhile but in no case has it achieved what they hoped it 
would said dr christopher g goetz of rushpresbyterianst 
lukes medical center in chicago 
the operation involves removing tissue from patients adrenal 
glands and transplanting it in their brains the goal is to provide 
the victims brains with a source of dopamine an essential 
messagecarrying chemical that they lack 
the operation was first reported two years ago by dr ignacio 
madrazo and colleagues at the national autonomous university of 
mexico and the social security hospital system in mexico city they 
reported dramatic improvement in two patients since then surgeons 
at many medical centers have tried to duplicate their results 
what came out originally was the sense that this was a 
miracle said goetz this is no miracle 
his report combined the results of surgery on 19 patients at his 
hospital and at the university of south florida and the university 
of kansas the results were being published in thursdays new 
england journal of medicine 
parkinsons disease results from destruction of a part of the 
brain called the nigral tissue which makes dopamine the adrenal 
glands which lie above the kidneys also produce the substance 
the disease afflicts between 500000 and 1 million americans 
including 2 percent of people over age 70 victims often suffer 
tremors and have trouble controlling their movements 
drugs can control the disease but as the illness worsens the 
medicines lose their effectiveness and often dont work for hours at 
a time 
before the surgery the patients drugs worked about half the 
time afterward this increased to threequarters of the time 
while the drugs are working the patients are able to move about 
and care for themselves with little assistance although they still 
clearly show the effects of the disease when the drugs are not 
effective the patients usually need wheelchairs 
despite cautious optimism we conclude that the widespread use 
of this procedure outside of research centers is premature the 
researchers wrote

the featured guest at the governmentrun 
institute of building techniques apologized to the crowd for his 
fancy blue suit 
i wanted to say im not that elegant i also work hard im 
just a worker lech walesa told the roughly 500 people in the 
audience 
the 45yearold shipyard electrician who chairs the banned 
solidarity free trade union movement won a round of applause tuesday 
when introduced by institute director marian weglarz 
i want to welcome the great pole the laureate of the nobel 
peace prize mr lech walesa it is a great honor that mr walesa 
bothered to come to us the day after the session of the round table 
long live walesa said weglarz 
walesa is leading the opposition delegation in historic 
roundtable talks with communist authorities that began monday 
and seeks the social accord needed to tackle polands daunting 
economic crisis 
we are witnesses to historic moments that will remain in our 
memory until the end of our lives long live lech walesa weglarz 
added 
since solidarity was crushed in a december 1981 military 
crackdown and banned the next year walesa has rarely been allowed 
to address workers legally on state property 
but walesa held a lively hourlong questionandanswer session 
with his constituents the rankandfile for whom he is trying to 
gain restoration of solidaritys legal status in the roundtable 
talks 
the rally was a reminder of the days during solidaritys 16month 
legal existence when walesa traveled the country captivating 
audiences with straightforward speeches explaining the need for free 
trade unions 
walesa responded to weglarzs introduction with some easygoing 
banter 
im surprised i have stage fright and i dont know what to 
answer mr director let me speak you are talking too much he 
said 
the crowd laughed 
the solidarity chairman seemed aware that to some it might 
appear a different walesa was behind the podium and he apologized 
for his fancy suit he is more frequently seen in drab polyester 
he explained i came here straight from the embassy where i 
said goodbye to the swiss foreign minister and i came here straight 
to you 
then speaking from a platform draped with a large solidarity 
banner he explained why he feels compelled to negotiate with the 
same authorities that crushed his movement and are widely distrusted 
by much of the populace 
im doing everything to take advantage of all chances to build 
agreement to build a better poland i think i wont let anybody 
cheat me i think you will not let anybody cheat you he said 
i dont believe in the round table but i do believe in you and 
in structures lech walesa and company are making it possible so 
that you can get organized so that you can choose structures and 
organizations to solve polish problems with them he said 
above all walesa counseled patience in poland which is wracked 
by a 39 billion foreign debt 60 percent inflation chronic 
consumer shortages and rising worker dissatisfaction 
the government first proposed the roundtable talks in august 
during the countrys worst labor unrest since solidaritys heyday 
walesa branded as great political stupidity a call for a 
second solidarity congress by andrzej gwiazda a former rival for 
leadership of the union who has criticized him for refusing to hold 
another national convention 
the congress would show many weaknesses within solidarity and 
we dont need it right now walesa said 
the audience peppered him with questions asking him what 
solidarity means how will it be organized and whether he trusts the 
authorities 
solidarity means first of all reform it is a fundamental 
problem today that we should get organized as a trade union 
walesa said 
he warned the crowd to above all remain peaceful 
if the polish peaceful evolution doesnt win there will be a 
revolution in this country and splinters may fall down far away 
so if you want to live in security its in your interest to allow 
the polish evolution to develop peacefully and it will be profitable 
for all 
we must remember that seven years have been wasted we must 
save the national tissue we must stop youth from escaping from 
poland no one will make order in poland for us it is our poland 
he said 
its beautiful to hear him again one woman in the crowd said

mississippi let a debt of more than 10 
billion build up during the past 148 years but the state treasurer 
says he has an idea that could turn all the red ink into a gold mine 
for college students 
back in 1841 mississippi defaulted on 7 million in bonds issued 
to purchase stock in two statecreated banks while that antebellum 
debt was ballooning to more than 10 billion state officials fended 
off repeated efforts by the british bondholders to get repaid 
now a london collection agency finally has given up the quest 
and state treasurer marshall bennett has cooked up a plan for the 
state to profit off the deal by selling the bonds as antiques 
theyve been an obscure part of mississippis history that has 
sort of been stored away in a vault bennett said outlining the 
events that led to his proposal to fund scholarships with proceeds 
from the bonds 
bennett said the seed for his idea was planted two weeks after he 
took office in january 1988 when the director of the council of the 
corporation of foreign bondholders called him from london seeking 
payment on many of the old bond certificates 
the debt collection agency had been hounding mississippi 
treasurers ever since its founding in 1868 most of the old 
mississippi bonds are held by british investors 
but bennett repeated that mississippi wouldnt pay a penny on the 
bonds he had no choice an article in the 1890 mississippi 
constitution specifically prohibited repayment 
last week the bondholders organization announced that it was 
going into liquidation 
we are withdrawing from the fray and we shant be pursuing the 
matter any longer council manager eric french said in a telephone 
interview from london 
in recent years the only debts remaining on the councils books 
involved east germany and mississippi french said it didnt appear 
likely that either would ever pay off their debts 
french said it is theoretically possible individual bondholders 
might continue trying to get their money from mississippi but he 
wasnt aware of any such plans 
bennett meanwhile explained that a small portion of the old 
bonds fell into the states hands years ago the bonds will never be 
redeemed but he said the state could sell them to antique bond 
collectors 
he said 450000 worth of the 7 million in bonds 450 documents 
with a face value of 1000 each were donated in 1914 to 
mississippis institutions of higher learning by the peabody trust 
fund established by the late massachusetts philanthropist george 
peabody the mississippi treasurer holds the bonds in trust 
bennett said most state college board members and legislators 
over the years were never aware of the bonds but he said he has had 
inquiries about them from a few auction and bond brokerage houses in 
new york and london 
he said the state should retain some of the bonds for historical 
purposes but he hopes the others will be sold possibly for as much 
as 500 each 
a broker for a new york auction house agreed that the old bonds 
could be marketed 
we want them for collectors its like anything else people 
collect postage stamps famous signatures it just appeals to a 
certain group of collectors said diana herzog of rm smythe amp 
co which specializes in the research appraisal and auction of 
antique documents 
she said interest in collecting antique bonds has increased 
greatly during recent years and the fact that the mississippi bonds 
were repudiated may even add to their value 
they have a history to them and theres a story there she 
said the story mirrors historical events

president bush says he still wants some sort of 
pay raise for congress judges and top federal officials even 
though he signed the death warrant for a 51 percent increase he 
initially endorsed 
bush was inviting suggestions for future raise proposals at a 
meeting with republican senators tuesday according to sen ted 
stevens ralaska 
and in a white house statement released after he signed the 
resolution defeating the raise bush said i believe that some 
level of pay increase is in order and i will be working with the 
house and senate leadership to develop proposals to achieve that 
end i would also like to express my special concern about the level 
of compensation for members of our federal judiciary 
the house voted 38048 tuesday and the senate followed suit 
946 in passing legislation to reject a pay raise plan for 
lawmakers top bureaucrats and members of the federal bench 
bush signed the measure several hours before the midnight 
deadline that would have allowed the raises to become law including 
a boost in congressional salary from 89500 to 135000 
the pay issue got the 101st congress off to a rocky start as 
public scorn was heaped upon lawmakers who were presented with a 
pay package recommended by a presidential commission and endorsed 
by former president reagan and bush 
by days end tuesday many lawmakers appeared drained but at 
least one still had a sense of humor 
i wish i was as thin as my wallet said sen barbara 
mikulski dmd in recognition of her being on the plump side 
house members especially faced an outraged public because the 
democratic leadership without protest from republican leaders 
had planned to let the raise become law without a vote 
speaker jim wright dtexas tried to accommodate them with a 
strategy to let the full raise become law wednesday and schedule a 
vote thursday to scale it back to 30 percent 
the plan collapsed and wright scheduled tuesdays rejection 
vote after antiraise lawmakers won a procedural vote monday that 
showed they had the strength to win 
the senate handled the problem differently voting 955 last week 
to reject the raise at a time it appeared the house would let the 
increase become law without a vote 
while some house members called the senate vote hypocritical it 
put the senators on record against the raise they had little choice 
but to repeat the sentiment tuesday when they voted again in order 
to conform to the house language 
sen james jeffords rvt who had voted against the raise the 
first time supported it tuesday 
jeffords said he cast his vote tuesday in part to make clear his 
view that judges are badly in need of a pay raise 
the other senators voting to sustain the raise were democrats 
christopher dodd of connecticut edward kennedy of massachusetts and 
spark matsunaga of hawaii and republicans stevens and frank 
murkowski of alaska 
during house debate several lawmakers focused not on themselves 
but on warnings that defeat of the raise proposal would accelerate 
an exodus of jurists and top managers from government service 
chief justice william h rehnquist weighed in too commenting 
i deeply regret the congressional action which has prevented the 
federal judges in this country from receiving a welldeserved pay 
raise we will not be able to attract and retain the kind of 
judges we need unless we pay our judges fairly and equitably 
this issue isnt over said rep tom tauke riowa a leading 
opponent of the pay raise who said the congress must deal this year 
with pay for judges and bureaucrats as well as the questions 
involved in honoraria and other forms of outside income for 
lawmakers 
the votes left unresolved whether congress still wants to reform 
the honoraria system which allows lawmakers to accept speaking fees 
and travel expenses from special interests 
the senate last week voted unanimously to ban acceptance of fees 
but made the resolution contingent on the pay raise becoming law 
bipartisan negotiators in the house had agreed to a package to 
ban such fees in addition to closing a loophole that allowed house 
members in office prior to 1980 to convert unused campaign cash to 
personal use 
the debate in the two houses tuesday was as different as the way 
each chamber handled the pay issue 
senate debate was as emotionless as the house debate was 
emotional 
the most revealing moment came when the powerful chairman of the 
house ways and means committee dan rostenkowski of illinois rose 
to speak 
he reminded members that congressional perks cant make up for 
the birthdays ballgames holidays and meals that we miss 
he asked when was the last time you skipped a town meeting for 
a school play if you cant remember ask your spouse you maintain 
two households but youre never home 
rostenkowski received a rousing round of applause but only 
moments later many of the same house members voted to reject the 
raise

mayors from cities across the nation anxious 
to discover whether the bush administration will help them fight the 
drug war on the city streets got an encouraging sign but no 
promises from drug czardesignate william j bennett 
this is serious business bennett told the us conference of 
mayors on tuesday this is the business of state and local 
governments but it is emphatically the business of the federal 
government 
but bennett nominated by president bush to become the nations 
first director of national drug control policy didnt say how that 
business would translate into dollars for the local governments 
the mayors are extremely concerned about funding because while 
the drug bill called for 275 million to be spent in the current 
fiscal year for justice assistance programs grants to state and 
local agencies only 220 million has been appropriated by congress 
and no money at all was included for those programs in president 
reagans budget proposal for fiscal 1990 in that year the drug 
bill called for 350 million to be spent on those programs bush is 
expected to reveal his budget proposals for fiscal 1990 later this 
week 
san diego mayor maureen oconnor noting that her city suffered 
96 driveby shooting incidents last year called for federal funds 
to be funneled directly to the local governments a suggestion 
loudly applauded by her colleagues 
the problem with some of the federal money in the past is that 
it had to go through so many hands before it go to the streets and 
by the time it gets to the streets its too late oconnor said 
addressing her remarks to bennett she said if theres some 
way that you could organize a program to go from the federal 
government right to the local entity to help solve the problem you 
will have done more for the war on drugs than anything i can think 
of 
bennett told reporters after the conference that his budget 
decisions would have to await completion of the national drug 
control strategy report which is due 180 days after he is confirmed 
by the senate his hearings before the senate judiciary committee 
are scheduled to begin march 1 
certainly some of the effort is going to take money he said 
youre going to see some progrss and some movement on this issue 
very soon the sixmonth report is the critical document to me 
sen joseph r biden jr ddel chairman of the senate 
judiciary committee predicted that congress would fully fund the 
drug bill for the current year approving legislation already 
introduced in both houses to add 16 billion to spending 
while those bills do not specify how to pay for that spending 
biden said it could be provided by raising taxes on cigarettes beer 
and liquor 
were still 60 percent behind what the tax was in 1954 on those 
commodities he said if you have a better idea suggest it or 
stop saying you support the drug bill 
bennett said he will pay attention to the law enforcement end of 
the drug war and is considering a bigger role for the military but 
he wouldnt disclose what role that might be 
joking about the controversy over bushs decision to leave him 
out of the cabinet bennett told the mayors i have a meeting with 
the president tomorrow one on one as a bonus on thursday im 
going to a cabinet meeting i always prefer a oneonone 
tutorial to a seminar

federal officials trying to contain the 
multibilliondollar cost of the savings and loan bailout are 
mobilizing more than 1200 regulators to take control of all 
remaining insolvent sampls over the next few weeks 
the massive government takeover was announced tuesday as 
financial regulators scrambled to implement the first portions of 
president bushs sampl overhaul package 
meanwhile the bush proposals were receiving initial favorable 
reactions from congress although some lawmakers said they had 
reservations about some aspects of the proposals in particular the 
40 billion estimated cost to taxpayers 
officials of the federal savings and loan insurance corp which 
insures deposits at sampls and the federal deposit insurance corp 
which performs the same function at banks predicted that within a 
month they would have joint regulatory teams in place at 
approximately 224 insolvent sampls 
the government takeover will transfer control of the sampls to the 
federal regulators who will oversee policy decisions made by local 
managers of the insolvent institutions 
in most cases government regulators will keep the insolvent 
institutions open until congress funds a rescue package at that 
time the institutions are to be sold with government assistance to 
new investors 
these institutions have been allowed to stay open even though 
they were losing billions of dollars annually because regulators did 
not have the money to close them down 
the bush proposal in addition to revamping the government 
regulatory structure proposes raising 90 billion to bail out 
insolvent institutions through a combination of 40 billion in tax 
dollars and higher insurance premiums paid by banks and sampls 
both senate banking committee chairman donald riegle dmich 
and house banking committee chairman henry b gonzalez dtexas 
pledged on tuesday that their committees would move quickly to vote 
on the bush plan 
when we are losing on the order of 33 million a day from sampl 
operating losses all of us are under enormous responsibilities to 
get this package done riegle said 
gonzalez predicted his panel could vote on the proposal by the 
first week in march 
the government takeover of insolvent sampls had been urged last 
week by the general accounting office which said the sick sampls were 
offering high interest rates to attract deposits thus driving up 
costs for the healthy part of the industry and increasing the 
ultimate bailout cost to the government 
four insolvent sampls in maryland texas california and florida 
were taken over by the regulatory teams on tuesday with officials 
saying they were working off a priority list targeting the largest 
insolvent sampls with the biggest rate of losses first 
the announcement of the takeovers coming just one day after bush 
unveiled his plan to deal with the sampl crisis reflected the impact 
the presidents proposals were already having 
officials said they planned to mobilize between 1200 and 1500 
regulators from four different federal agencies to handle the 
takeover job in coming weeks 
bush has called on congress to abolish the fslic as a separate 
insurance agency and have its functions taken over by the bank 
insurance agency the fdic 
fdic chairman l william seidman said he had sent out letters to 
all employees of the beleaugered fslic fund assuring them of 
employment with his agency 
m danny wall chairman of the federal home loan bank board 
which currently runs the fslic fund said that the two agencies were 
working in full cooperation and harmony 
wall said he supported bushs proposals which include abolishing 
the threemember bank board and putting wall and the bank board 
regulatory apparatus under the supervision of the treasury 
department 
while this transfer and the actual takeover of the fslic by the 
fdic would require congressional approval the joint supervisory 
effort did not need congressional authorization 
regulators from the two insurance funds said they were also 
receiving assistance from bank auditors with the office of the 
comptroller of the currency and the federal reserve 
the four institutions the government took control of on tuesday 
were baltimore federal financial of maryland freedom savings and 
loan association of tampa fla pacific savings bank of costa mesa 
calif and gill savings association of hondo texas 
two of the institutions freedom and gill were already under 
government control in a supervisory program run by sampl regulators 
under the new initiative the sampl regulators will be joined by 
regulators from the fdic 
seidman said the government regulators will try to minimize 
operating losses eliminate speculative lending practices and ferret 
out any continuing examples of insider abuse and fraud

members of the senate finance committee are 
reviewing the financial file on cabinet nominee louis sullivan along 
with assurances from government ethics officials that he will have 
no conflicts of interest 
sullivan president bushs nominee to head the department of 
health and human services has agreed to sell some of his financial 
holdings and recuse himself on matters that involve his medical 
school according to an hhs ethics official 
the actions will avoid the potential for any conflicts of 
interests or appearance of a conflict darrel j grinstead hhs 
ethics official said in a letter to frank q nebeker director of 
the office of government ethics 
copies of the letter were sent to finance committee members along 
with copies of sullivans financial disclosure form the ethics 
office said 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the committee said he 
wanted to move as expeditiously as possible on sullivans 
confirmation hearing but congressional sources who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity said the hearing probably wont be held for 
at least two weeks 
though initial review of the ethics report raised few questions 
among committee members lawmakers say they want time for a close 
review of the nominees financial disclosure report and congress is 
scheduled to be in recess next week 
this man looks excellent on paper to us said a congressional 
source who spoke on the condition of anonymity but the source 
added we dont want to have any corners on this tent that arent 
nailed down 
sullivans confirmation originally scheduled for last week was 
postponed by lingering questions over sullivans financial situation 
and his fbi background check 
the nominee put to rest the major concerns raised about his ties 
to the morehouse school of medicine when he said he would resign as 
president forgo nearly 300000 in severance pay and take an unpaid 
leave of absence as a professor of medicine 
an fbi background check focused in part on his connection to a 
georgia politician convicted of extortion who unrelated to the 
extortion case was paid as a parttime lecturer by morehouse while 
he used his seat on the county commission to support issues that 
benefited the school 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said tuesday the 
background investigation had been completed and found no adverse 
information as far as we know 
grinsteads letter said sullivan agreed to divest himself of 
holdings in three companies to avoid any potential conflicts of 
interest 
the holdings he will divest are valued at between 7000 and 
25000 in a total portfolio worth between 633000 and 117 
million or more his largest holdings are in pension plans valued 
at between 450000 and 750000 or more his liabilities are listed 
at between 40000 and 115000 
while on leave sullivan will not be paid by morehouse but will 
continue to participate in the schools employee benefit plans 
including health and life insurance disability insurance and the 
schools retirement plan according to grinsteads letter 
the letter also says that because of his continued tie to 
morehouse sullivan would recuse himself from participating as hhs 
secretary in matters such as grants contracts litigation 
investigations and enforcement actions specifically involving the 
school 
the white house however has agreed to allow sullivan to 
participate in general policy matters such as regulations and 
legislation that would affect morehouse only to the same extent that 
similarly situated institutions would be affected grinstead said 
in the letter 
finance committee members want more information about others 
who have maintained their ties with academic institutions after 
taking a federal government job the congressional source said 
were looking for examples in which this kind of situation has 
occurred before

the 51 percent pay raise that congress wound up rejecting 
dominated the airwaves around the country with switchboards at some 
talkradio stations lighting up nearly once a minute and practically 
every caller was against it 
since the election its been the best issue as far as stirring 
people up talkshow host roger gray of kprc in houston said 
tuesday 
and its almost unanimously negative i think today we got one 
caller in support but callers like that are in the distinct 
minority 
responding to the outcry against the proposed pay hike congress 
voted overwhelmingly tuesday to reject it then rushed the 
legislation to president bush who signed it hours before a midnight 
deadline 
rep vic fazio a pay raise defender chided house colleagues for 
not having the courage to speak out in their own defense we 
became cartoon cannon fodder for trash television and talk radio 
the california democrat complained 
this wasnt artificially created said talkradio host mike 
siegel of station king in seattle who ran his show from washington 
dc last week and testified before a senate committee on the pay 
raise the lines were flooded every day 
siegel urged listeners to write and call representatives to 
express opposition to the proposal and was part of a network of 
stations nationwide that suggested sending lawmakers tea bags 
symbolic of the boston tea party 
everybodys thrilled by tuesdays vote said cindy slay 
producer of the jim eason talk show at kgo in san francisco i get 
maybe one call out of 50 who say they were for the pay raise 
slay said the show which is on weekdays from 24 pm received 
about 50 calls per hour or nearly one a minute on the issue 
several callers to kgo thanked talkshow hosts and activists such 
as ralph nader for drawing attention to the issue slay said 
the credit should go to the outraged citizenry who mailed in 
tea bags and truckloads of letters and who complained and made phone 
calls said eason 
in baltimore wbal talkshow host ron smith said people were 
just very gratified amazed and delighted that they made this effort 
against the odds and that they actually achieved something 
he said 80 to 90 percent of his callers expressed outrage at the 
pay raises size its timing and the original plan for it to have 
taken effect automatically 
in washington callers to wwrc expressed happiness that the pay 
raise had been turned down said producer lori madock 
our lines are going crazy she said noting that the 
stations nine telephone lines had been receiving about 25 calls an 
hour 
this congressional pay raise is a joke said a caller 
identifying himself as jim of herndon va look at the mess 
theyve made of things 
but rita in bethesda md said she thought the raise should have 
been approved these people who oppose the raise seem to think 
thats a tremendous amount of money and it isnt she said 
in phoenix ktar news director preston westmoreland said so many 
callers opposed the plan because people feel that with the 
economic troubles of today and the budget deficit that you just have 
no business giving yourself a 50 percent pay raise 
of the dozen people who called pittsburghs kdka on tuesday 
the overriding message now that its done is lets find out who 
supported it and vote them out of office said producer greg jena 
among those taking heavy fire were house speaker jim wright 
dtexas who initially had planned to let the increase take effect 
automatically today without a house vote 
im very disgusted in jim wright said one caller to klifam 
in fort worth which wright represents im going to work as hard 
as i can to get him out of office

of 99 percent the federal reserve board said tuesday the consumer 
debt rose 47 billion in november and increased 39 billion in 
october

percent in november and 72 percent in october 
decembers increase matched the 99 percent rise recorded last 
august which was the highest since a 152 percent increase in june 
the december jump was paced by an increase in outstanding auto 
loans while growth in the category of debt that includes credit 
cards slowed from the rapid pace of the preceding two months 
consumer spending is closely watched as a barometer of economic 
health because it accounts for twothirds of the gross national

chilean frogmen worked to stop oil from 
leaking from a partially submerged ship off antarctica authorities 
said and a report today said thousands of polar seabirds have 
already died near the spreading slick 
crewmen from the chilean cutter yelcho on tuesday encircled the 
nearly sunken argentina vessel bahia paraiso with floating booms 
designed to contain any further leakage said a navy communique 
released in santiago 
new zealand press association today reported that thousands of 
baby polar skua gulls had died because their parents were unable to 
find food 
the predatory birds also can freeze to death if the oil disrupts 
their natural insulation or be poisoned if they swallow oil while 
preening themselves or eat contaminated prey 
the news agency citing unidentified scientists at the nearby 
us palmer station on the antarctic peninsula said the oil slick 
has surrounded penguin rookeries near the wrecked ship 
an operator reached by telephone at the research station referred 
all inquiries to the washingtonbased national science foundation 
which oversees the base 590 miles from the tip of south america 
the argentine research and supply ship grounded on shoals jan 28 
the ship holds about 800 tons of fuel including diesel oil in 
bulk and aviation fuel in steel drums the national science 
foundation says oil is leaking slowly from the ship which gradually 
sank in the shallow waters only a section of its superstructure 
remains above the surface 
foundation officials said tuesday that a slick nearly 500 feet 
wide and two miles long was trailing away from the vessel toward the 
south threatening the frozen continents fragile and unspoiled 
environment todays new zealand report said the slick was four 
miles long it did not mention width 
a us research vessel the polar duke was expected to join 
cleanup efforts it carries military and civilian experts and 52 
tons of sophisticated equipment 
a research vessel of the chilean antarctic institute also was at 
the spill site evaluating environmental damage said the insitutes 
director antonio massei 
in a telephone interview in santiago he said the area around the 
accident is home to 29000 penguins scientists say many baby 
penguins soon will take their first swim in the waters and they are 
worried the youngsters could suffocate in the oil 
other wildlife also is threatened including krill a tiny 
shrimplike crustacean considered a vital link in antarcticas food 
chain 
us researchers say a number of seals were seen covered with oil 
and moving slowly in the waters 
both the yelcho and the polar duke left friday from the chilean 
port of punta arenas a major supply point for antarctic operations 
two argentine vessels were in the area of the spill and planned 
to help according to the chilean navy however the ships were 
awaiting equipment being flown from argentina to a chileanrun base 
200 miles from the wreckage

the tokyo stock exchanges leading index setting a 
new high for the fourth consecutive day passed the 32000point 
level for the first time today while the dollar closed unchanged 
from the previous days close 
the 225issue nikkei stock average gained 18447 points or 058 
percent closing at 3206512 its previous record closing set 
tuesday was 3188065 
the index rose sharply shortly after the market opened and 
stayed higher following gains on overseas markets overnight 
dealers said 
a nomura securities dealer said individual and foreign investors 
strong buying interest has contributed to the nikkeis recent rise 
foreign investors bought issues worth an estimated 42 billion in 
january he added speaking on condition of anonymity 
with demand for stocks exceeding supply unless more new issues 
are listed on the exchange the nikkeis trend will continue he 
said 
but the recent surge in prices would make investors nervous and 
some institutional investors already have begun to sell issues to 
take profits because they feel insecure holding such highpriced 
issues for a long period the dealer added 
in active trading with first section volume estimated at 17 
billion shares steel and shipbuilding shares were among the gainers 
in currency dealings the dollar opened at 12950 yen unchanged 
from tuesdays close and finished at the same level it traded in a 
tight range of 1294012953 yen 
a continued narrow range was expected ahead of president bushs 
budget speech to congress scheduled for thursday night dealers 
said 
the dollaryen rate hardly moved because investors were equally 
selling and buying the us currency for speculative reasons said 
chemical banks ichiro ikeda 
meanwhile bank of japan governor satoshi sumita told a news 
conference today that some representatives of seven leading 
industrial nations meeting in washington last friday expressed 
concern about the high levels of the dollar against the west german 
mark 
he said intervention by japans central bank in defense of the 
west german mark is included in policy of the group of seven as 
a matter of course

jackie thomas desperately wishes someone 
could tell her how to cope with the rare disease that forces her 
4yearold daughter to live life away from sunlight her facial skin 
to be replaced by surgery 
every time wendy thomas goes outside she must wear a large 
sunbonnet and special sunglasses that protect her delicate eyes if 
she doesnt she runs the risk of developing more of the skin 
cancers that already have marred her eversmiling face and threaten 
her life 
unless it is night she must travel only in her familys van 
which is equipped with window blinds and tints even in the house 
she must be careful to play on the side away from what rays get past 
the blinds and shades and she must be covered every day with the 
most powerful sun blocker manufactured 
as wendy prepared to undergo more surgery thursday in dallas her 
32yearold mother said she can only wish there was a support group 
in texas for mothers of children with xeroderma pigmentosum she 
would even start one if she could find someone to join 
i wish somebody could tell me what wendy is going to go 
through especially in the last and final stages she said but 
i cant find anybody 
only a couple hundred americans have the usually fatal disease 
the odds of having xp as the affliction is known are literally 
oneinamillion says its foremost expert dr kenneth kraemer a 
research scientist at the national cancer institute in bethesda md 
those with xp must be constantly protected from sunlight 
otherwise their skin and eyes may be severely damaged 
but the real risk for wendy comes from the numerous skin cancers 
that form on xp patients some of which could prove fatal if not 
treated in time also about 20 percent of xp patients have 
nerverelated problems and may develop deafness muscular disorders 
or retardation 
wendy has had so many skin cancers removed from her fair 
freckled skin during seven previous surgeries that her parents have 
agreed to allow a plastic surgeon to replace all the skin on her 
face 
at present her face is scarcovered and her scalp is hairless in 
several patches the girls parents say they know the extensive skin 
grafting is risky but say it is her only chance for a fresh start 
and survival otherwise she faces a risk of melanoma the most 
severe form of skin cancer 
the surgeon dr h steve byrd would rather not talk about how 
risky the surgery is his secretary said 
the difficult and painful surgery will take place at dallas 
baylor university medical center where wendy will have an extender 
inserted into her abdomen so skin can be stretched and later removed 
to be grafted onto her face mrs thomas said 
i wish she was old enough to make some of these decisions on 
her own mrs thomas said shes gone through so much pain 
already 
some of the pain isnt merely physical and that is just becoming 
evident to the child 
even in athens where several fundraisers have been held to help 
the thomases with medical bills some women will pull their children 
away from wendy fearful her disease may be contagious said mrs 
thomas who lost her a factory job recently and whose husband is a 
farmer 
it is not said kraemer who has produced the only laymens guide 
to the disease and a lucky few who were diagnosed early in life 
have lived relatively normal lives he said 
mrs thomas said she can only sit and wonder how effective 
previous surgeries have been in removing all the skin cancers 
quite frankly for a long time id just sit in my house and 
cry she said i used to blame myself for wendys problems i 
used to love sitting out in the sun and wendy would always be with 
me 
mrs thomas and her husband ronnie didnt identify wendys 
problem was until she was 2 when she suddenly turned bright red in 
what seemed to be an untreatable sunburn and the first doctor that 
did know what was wrong gave them no encouragement the thomases had 
asked how xp would affect wendys schooling 
he said you wont have to worry about that she wont be 
around that long mrs thomas said 
the thomases who live with their three children in this town of 
10000 residents 60 miles southeast of dallas refuse to let their 
faith waver they say they must be willing to take desperate 
measures because they desperately love wendy and no matter what 
cost they must meet it will gladly be paid 
and im different said mrs thomas someday when another 
mother needs me when someone needs to know what its like going 
through the last and final stages im going to tell them

bribery charges against the navajo nations 
chairman have fueled demands for his resignation but he says hes 
been targeted by washington as a modernday geronimo because of 
his work for indian rights 
chairman peter macdonald sr also told members of the nations 
largest tribe that it was an indian practice for a leader to accept 
gifts while doing business according to a speech released by his 
staff 
these kinds of acts of appreciation are a part of navajo 
culture ferlin clark an assistant press aide quoted macdonald 
on monday 
macdonald whose tribe numbers about 200000 and lives in 
arizona new mexico and utah has declined to talk with reporters 
about a us senate select committee on indian affairs investigation 
into claims of contractor kickbacks and of his profiting from the 
purchase of a ranch 
john chapela a former navajo housing administration director 
leading a recall drive against macdonald said tuesday the 
60yearold chairman is using his influence over the navajo 
newspaper and radio station to portray the hearings to his people 
as an attack on the navajo nation the navajo people and their 
tribal sovereignty 
chapela said macdonald was corrupt and has entrenched himself at 
the expense of his people 
clark told the arizona republic newspaper that macdonald assured 
listeners he broke no rules in his weekend speech to the chichiltah 
chapter in new mexico 
while these contractors gave gifts as appreciation i want to 
explain to you that they were required to follow the rules and 
regulations of the navajo tribe macdonald said according to 
clarks translation of the navajo text 
macdonald also said senate investigators compared him with 
geronimo the apache medicine man who remained on the warpath until 
the early 1900s 
they refer to me as a modernday geronimo he said 
chapela said it would be a minor step to get the 36000 
signatures needed to force a recall election compared to the 
difficulty of getting the signatures certified by the navajo 
election commission and persuading twothirds of the tribes 
88member council to approve a recall vote as required 
macdonald handpicked the election administrator and controls the 
votes of more than 30 council members chapela said in a telephone 
interview from his law office in window rock 300 miles northeast of 
phoenix 
macdonald has insulated himself by firing reporters at the tribal 
newspaper and radio station and replacing them with his supporters 
and by contracting with the bureau of indian affairs to provide 
onreservation investigators chapela said 
with that move there is no place on the reservation that a 
navajo person can go to present allegations of fraud 
misappropriation or misuse of tribal monies without having to go 
through mr macdonald he said 
duane beyal a spokesman for former tribal chairman peterson zah 
said two of the 109 chapters or precincts on the reservation have 
called for macdonalds resignation and others were considering doing 
so 
zah has not demanded the chairmans resignation but has asked for 
a separate tribal investigation 
macdonalds part in the ranch land sale is under investigation by 
a federal grand jury but no charges have been filed 
in 1977 a us district court jury failed to reach a verdict 
against him on fraud and incometaxevasion charges several 
businessmen had testified they were asked for bribes in exchange for 
business claims similar to those raised in the current senate 
investigation 
macdonald a flamboyant former project engineer for hughes 
aerospace of tucson ousted the conservative zah by a 750vote 
margin of 60000 votes cast in a november 1986 election macdonald 
served three fouryear terms before zah defeated him in 1982 
on tuesday the senate committee listened to secretly taped 
conversations in which macdonald told a real estate broker how to 
cover up the thousands of dollars the broker paid him for helping 
arrange purchase of a ranch by the tribe 
the broker byron t bud brown said he arranged for a 
businessman to buy the 491000acre big boquillas ranch for 262 
million and immediately sell it to the navajos for 334 million 
brown said he gave macdonald 75000 plus a bmw automobile as his 
share of the profits 
aside from any questionable payments beyal said the land 
purchase violated navajo tradition 
its outside our aboriginal homelands according to navajo 
myth and legend beyal said theyre even fighting about the 
northern boundary of big boquillas which means all we did was buy a 
new land dispute

two women have filed lawsuits accusing 
their former doctor of impregnating them during romantic liaisons 
then performing abortions without their knowledge one said she had 
been eight months pregnant 
robert w york an attorney who represents the women suing dr 
pravin d thakkar said tuesday his clients seek unspecified damages 
for the loss of the fetuses and for emotional harm 
i cant imagine what it would be like to be a mother and have 
something growing inside you that you wanted and to have it taken 
from you in the way that it was york said i think its been 
very hard for both of them to handle and to deal with 
carmen brutchen hertzinger of anderson filed her lawsuit last 
week against thakkar in madison circuit court kathy collins of 
madison county said in her nov 4 lawsuit that the abortion was 
performed in her second or third month of pregnancy 
thakkar an obstetriciangynecologist denied the allegations 
all i can say is the facts in the matter will not stand up to 
these allegations he said 
hertzinger said she became thakkars patient in october 1982 on 
her first visit to his office in nearby frankton about 30 miles 
northeast of indianapolis thakkar suggested they see each other 
socially and hertzinger accepted according to the lawsuit 
hertzinger said she became pregnant with thakkars child in 
february 1983 thakkar is accused of administering drugs to 
hertzinger causing her to deliver the fetus in his home eight 
months later he told her the baby was stillborn and he had taken 
care of it hertzinger said 
however hertzinger said tuesday that she was conscious during 
part of the procedure and heard a babys cry 
there were many times of unconsciousness but this was a time 
that i was very conscious and theres something about a babys cry 
that you dont forget she told wishtv in indianapolis 
thakkars attorney michael lacey said he was told hertzingers 
infant was stillborn at a hospital 
wishtv reported that although state law would require a death 
certificate for a stillbirth none was filed with the madison county 
health department during that time 
collins claims thakkar fathered her unborn child and that he 
aborted the fetus with a medical instrument during an examination 
jan 9 1988 
during the examination collins said tuesday thakkar told her 
she was not carrying a child 
i breathed a sigh of relief and i felt an excruciating pain 
that sent me to the top of the examining table she said i felt 
the instrument dragging on the examining table i told him to take 
it out 
thakkar again manipulated the instrument causing more pain she 
said 
at that point i just rolled off the top of the examining 
table the instrument fell out and i went to the bathroom she 
said 
thakkar denied collins claims but did say he had an onagain 
offagain relationship with her at one time 
his said the indiana attorney generals office was investigating 
thakkar as a result of the complaints 
madison circuit judge fredrick spencer signed a temporary 
restraining order against thakkar last week preventing him from 
attempting to sell transfer or dispose of his assets pending a 
hearing monday 
the order came after york filed a petition to set up a 
receivership for thakkars assets claiming the doctor advertised to 
sell real estate in madison county after collins filed her complaint

a bus driver told passengers hang on i 
have no brakes moments before his city bus plunged off a steep 
winding road and down a 60foot cliff killing 19 people and 
injuring 22 authorities said 
the driver enrique hernandez de jesus and two children were 
among the 14 bus occupants dead at the scene of the accident on the 
outskirts of this baja california resort 65 miles south of the us 
border 
five other passengers died at hospitals ensenada fire department 
spokesman jose luis chavez said several of the injured passengers 
remained hospitalized tuesday in critical condition said miroslava 
cuellar a spokeswoman for the city of ensenada 
a mass funeral was planned for today said ramon moreno owner of 
the moreno funeral home which is handling the arrangements 
baja california transit office records show the vehicle had gone 
five years without a mechanical inspection and had no insurance as 
required by state law cuellar said 
it is wellknown that there is corruption between the transport 
companies and state transit officials she said 
considering that these vehicles are allowed to operate without 
inspections and without insurance and that drivers are paid not a 
salary but by the number of passengers they can cram into their 
buses it is clear there is corruption 
officials of transportes rojo y blanco red and white bus line 
the private transit company that owns the bus declined comment 
tuesday about the accident 
chavez said he hoped the tragedy would prompt an investigation of 
ensenadas public transportation system which he said is full of 
buses that are coffins on wheels 
most of the passengers on the bus bound for downtown were from a 
poor neighborhood of ensenada a city of 78000 people but it 
wasnt immediately known if any of the occupants were from outside 
of mexico 
the accident occurred monday as the bus traveled a steep windy 
stretch of road four miles northeast of downtown 
the bus apparently was going too fast when hernandez came to a 
sharp curve causing the vehicle to careen over an embankment 
chavez said 
it tore through the wire fence of the ensenada country club and 
rolled several times down a dirt slope stopping about 100 feet from 
the clubs swimming pool the roof of the mangled bus was flattened 
almost to the floor in some places authorities said 
people started screaming and pushing trying to get to the 
door and then everything was flying passenger juana santiago 
19 said from her bed at ensenada general hospital i hugged my 
baby and closed my eyes i dont remember anything that happened 
after that 
santiago who was taking her daughter to a vaccine center 
suffered a broken leg she said her daughter was not injured 
seriously but her motherinlaw who was seated next to her was 
dead 
one passenger told fire officials that the driver yelled hang 
on tight i have no brakes moments before the bus plunge 
a woman who lives about 200 yards from the accident scene said 
she ran to see what happened after hearing a tremendous crash 
it was a horror scene said leticia perez de la rosa 
people were screaming begging for help and i started to cry 
eduardo guillen commander of the baja california judicial police 
in ensenada said the state has ordered an immediate inspection of 
all buses in the city 
if the company is found to be responsible for the accident 
through negligence then it will have to pay for all damages 
guillen said

a militant tamil separatist group said 
today it has appealed to the un commission on human rights to 
mediate an end the 5year ethnic conflict that has claimed 8500 
lives in sri lanka 
the liberation tigers of tamil eelam the most powerful tamil 
guerrilla group also called for an immediate ceasefire and the 
withdrawal of the estimated 47000 indian soldiers on the indian 
ocean island 
indian troops were sent to sri lanka in 1987 to disarm the tigers 
in order to enforce an indiansponsored peace accord 
the tigers initially accepted the accord but later reneged 
resuming attacks on the countrys sinhalese ethnic majority and 
battling the indian peacekeeping force 
the tigers in a letter to the un claimed indian troops 
under the cover of peacekeeping operations continue to engage 
themselves in a ruthless and brutal war against the innocent 
civilian masses causing intolerable suffering to the tamil people 
the tigers accused indian soldiers of committing torture 
executions without trial and extermination of more than 200 
prominent tamils who opposed the 1987 accord 
in new delhi an indian official rejected the tigers accusation 
calling it part of their usual propaganda 
a copy of the tigers appeal to the un was sent by telex to 
news offices in colombo from the guerrillas information office in 
london 
its arrival coincided with todays withdrawal from northern sri 
lanka of an indian battalion one of two the sri lankan defense 
ministry announced tuesday would return home within two weeks 
following discussions between the indian and sri lankan governments 
two other battalions consisting of about 3500 men withdrew in 
early january 
president ranasinghe premadasa who took office jan 2 has 
pledged to seek the withdrawal of indian troops and to convert the 
july 1987 indiansri lankan accord into a peace and friendship 
treaty 
the accord was signed by prime minister rajiv gandhi of india and 
president junius r jayewardene premadasas predecessor 
india which once provided sanctuary to the tigers on indian 
soil became involved in the affairs of its small island neighbor 
because of the political clout of indian tamils who comprise about 
7 percent of indias 880 million people 
in sri lanka tamils account for 18 percent of the population of 
16 million 
the tamils like the majority of indians are hindu in sri 
lanka they claim they were discriminated against by the sinhalese 
buddhist majority that comprises 75 percent of the population 
the tigers and other tamil guerrilla groups launched their 
separatist war in 1983 saying they needed their own homeland to 
combat alleged discrimination in jobs education and efforts to 
impose the sinhalese language on tamilspeakers 
since then more than 8500 people have been killed the majority 
of the victims were sinhalese civilians more than 600 indian 
soldiers have been killed in ambushes or battles with the tamil 
guerrillas

a judge sentenced a reputed terrorist to 30 
years in prison for transporting explosives saying the defendant 
was out for flesh and blood with planned bombings in retaliation 
for the us bombing of libya 
you are a member of the japanese red army us district 
judge alfred j lechner jr told yu kikumura on tuesday you have 
engaged in a course of terrorism you planned to kill and injure 
scores of people 
there is no other conclusion that can be drawn but that you are 
an international terrorist 
in his first statements in court since his arrest the japanese 
national said prior to sentencing that his november conviction on 
charges of transporting explosives and possessing firearms was 
trumped up by the us government to justify the bombing of libya 
which he called a violation of international law 
i denounce these immoral acts of state terrorism the 
36yearold kikumura said in heavily accented english i do not 
have the background claimed by the united states 
throughout much of the sixhour sentencing hearing kikumura 
smiled and chuckled through his black mustache and chestlength 
beard 
lechner sentenced kikumura to 30 years unswayed by kikumuras 
claims of being a scapegoat and by defense lawyers arguments that 
the bombs found in his car at a new jersey turnpike rest stop may 
have been intended only to damage property in new york city and not 
injure people 
there is only one conclusion to draw from the design and 
construction of the bombs lechner said they were intended and 
designed for flesh and blood not for bricks and mortar 
lechner also noted that new federal guidelines prevent early 
parole telling kikumura what you are sentenced to is what will 
you serve 
us attorney samuel alito said kikumura planned to use the bombs 
to destroy a navy recruitment office in the veterans administration 
building in lower manhattan 
new jersey state detective joseph fuentes testified at the 
hearing that witnesses saw someone who looked like kikumura at the 
recruitment office and the buildings location was marked by a 
felttip pen on a map found inside kikumuras car 
also circled on the map were columbia university new york 
university and city college of new york fuentes said 
hes a terrorist and he has been a terrorist said alito who 
had asked for the maximum 100 years in prison he argued that 
kikumuras lawyer civil rights attorney william m kunstler 
offered no other reason why kikumura had the three bombs 
alito said that had it not been for a chance encounter with an 
alert new jersey state trooper kikumura may have gotten away with 
mass murder 
if he is let out again next time the odds are we will not be 
so lucky alito said 
the defense had asked for 27 to 33 months imprisonment and in a 
plea bargain reserved the right to appeal the conviction over the 
issue of whether kikumuras car had been searched legally 
investigators testified they used hotel and store receipts to 
track kikumuras travels through new york new jersey pennsylvania 
ohio michigan illinois missouri tennessee kentucky and west 
virginia as he picked up bomb parts before his april 12 arrest 
kikumura was trained at a terrorist camp in lebanon and planned 
to carry out the bombing in conjunction with the april 14 attack on 
a uso club in naples italy that killed five people including a 
us servicewoman alito said 
kikumuras arrest came two days before the naples blast which 
was on the second anniversary of the us air strike against libya 
in which the residence of libyan leader moammar gadhafi was damaged 
found in kikumuras car were 3foot long steel canisters packed 
with gunpowder and lead shot electrical fusing devices clocks and

more than 100 blacks detained 
in port elizabeth have joined a hunger strike a civil rights group 
said today raising to about 300 the number of detainees threatening 
to starve themselves unless they are freed or charged 
the hunger strike which began in the johannesburg area on jan 
23 represents one of the most dramatic challenges to the policy of 
detention without trial since the national state of emergency was 
declared in june 1986 
the nationwide civil rights group black sash said today that 105 
detainees at st albans prison in port elizabeth many of them held 
since 1986 began the hunger strike on monday 
in a statement released today the detainees said 
notwithstanding 32 months of continuous detention without 
trial no case has been brought against us we are left with 
no alternative but to take our lives into our own hands and to 
demand our immediate release from this dehumanizing detention 
they said in the statement that they would consume neither food 
nor liquids until their demands are met 
an estimated 30000 people have been detained without charge for 
varying periods during the state of emergency an estimated 1000 to 
1500 people remain in detention 
on tuesday the law and order ministry declined to comment on 
reports that some of the detainees wrote an open letter to adriaan 
vlok the law and order minister warning him they would starve 
themselves to death unless freed 
the only government comment on the protest has been a statement 
from prison officials saying in part it does happen from time to 
time that prisoners go on socalled hunger strikes the prisons 
services deals responsibly with such situations 
the hunger strike was started more than two weeks ago by 20 
detainees at diepkloof prison between johannesburg and the huge 
black township of soweto about 170 more detainees at diepkloof 
subsequently joined the strike a group of detainees parents said 
at a news conference tuesday 
according to the black sash the detainees at st albans prison 
include more than 50 antiapartheid leaders in their third year of 
detention including prominent activists who helped organize a 
successful black consumer boycott in 1985 
lawyers have predicted that several of the activists affiliated 
with the nowbanned united democratic front may be charged with 
treason and put on trial three senior front leaders from transvaal 
province were convicted of treason last year after a threeyear 
trial 
under apartheid south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services 
stateofemergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict 
reporting about unrest security force actions treatment of 
detainees some forms of protest and a range of statements the 
government considers subversive enforcement of the regulations has 
not been comprehensive

a judge dismissed a lawsuit against the fbi 
by a 17yearold student who said he was under illegal surveillance 
because he had written foreign embassies for information to complete 
a sixthgrade project 
authorities have said the lawsuit which was dismissed tuesday 
was the first seeking to wipe out fbi files on first amendment 
activities 
were quite upset said edgar patterson whose son todd was 
the subject of fbi surveillance we think the attorney general 
should issue a warning like the surgeon general that says all 
letters written to foreign countries may result in an fbi file on 
you 
todd patterson now a senior at don bosco preparatory school in 
ramsey sought a halt to the surveillance deletion of the fbi file 
and unspecified damages for invasion of his privacy 
the fbi has acknowledged it kept a file on patterson when he was 
a sixthgrader 
patterson said the fbi violated his privacy rights by tampering 
with mail but us district judge alfred m wolin said none of the 
secret documents supported pattersons claim nor another allegation 
that the fbi wiretapped his familys telephone 
wolin in throwing out the lawsuit reviewed several fbi 
documents that were not made available to patterson the government 
had said releasing the documents would damage national security 
lawyers for patterson said his right of free speech was violated 
because the youth was penalized for pursuing his education and 
expressing himself 
attorney frank askin who filed the lawsuit on behalf of the 
american civil liberties union and patterson criticized the judge 
for basing his decision on fbi documents not available to the 
plaintiff 
we brought this suit against secret government and we got a 
secret judgment he said the family is disappointed by the 
decision 
to complete his school project a homemade encyclopedia 
patterson wrote to 169 embassies using the return address of his 
fathers company laboratory disposal products inc 
at least 50 pieces of mail arrived at his door damaged which 
askin argued was evidence of surveillance that violated the youths 
first amendment right to seek information and correspond freely 
patterson has said he was concerned the file would hurt his 
chances of entering the diplomatic service 
dick lavinthal a spokesman for the us attorneys office said 
government attorneys would not comment on the dismissal of the 
lawsuit until they have a chance to review the decision 
todd patterson was not available for comment his father said he 
was at school working on a school project the school yearbook

antiabortion activists obtained a court 
order temporarily blocking an abortion for a comatose woman just 
hours after her haggard husband won a judges permission to have the 
operation performed 
all i want to do is save my wifes life martin klein 34 of 
upper brookville on long island said tuesday after state judge 
bernard mccaffrey named him guardian of his wife nancy as a 
courtroom packed with family members abortion supporters and 
opponents and reporters looked on 
three hours later antiabortion activists john short of 
farmingdale and john broderick of syosett won a temporary stay of 
the order from appellate division judge vincent balletta jr despite 
objections from the state attorney generals office 
short and broderick who are seeking to become guardians of mrs 
klein and her fetus and klein must file papers today with the full 
appellate division which is expected to issue a ruling by friday 
mrs klein who is about 17 weeks pregnant has been in a coma at 
north shore university hospital since a car accident dec 13 
her husband sought an abortion after several physicians said it 
could help her recovery but the hospital said it would need a court 
order to perform the operation 
mccaffrey ruled that an abortion was not necessary to save mrs 
kleins life but said the issue was what constituted the 
constitutional rights of a hospitalized comatose woman who is 
approximately 17 weeks pregnant 
the judge said that based on medical testimony and records mrs 
klein is incompetent and a guardian should be appointed 
he gave klein permission to authorize any medical procedures that 
may be necessary to preserve his wifes life specifically ruling 
that klein is authorized to approve an abortion 
the responsibilities of the guardian in this instance are 
awesome because of the womans extensive brain injury and because 
the only type of abortion she could have would involve a very high 
risk mccaffrey said 
he noted that if mrs klein were competent she would have the 
absolute right to an abortion for any reason up to the 24th week of 
pregnancy 
this case is not an abortion case its a guardianship case 
said elizabeth bradford of the state attorney generals office 
clearly if mrs klein was given the choice of husband of nine 
years versus a stranger she would opt for her husband 
kleins attorney sidney schutz labeled the antiabortion 
activists interlopers adding to the problems of the family 
mccaffrey had dismissed their petitions last week agreeing that 
neither broderick nor short had a standing in the procedure 
in a twoday hearing last week five medical experts testified 
that pregnancy increased the risks for mrs klein and could threaten 
her life but the nassau county district attorney produced experts 
who testified the pregnancy was not lifethreatening 
short founder of the long island righttolife committee 
rejects the possibility that an abortion would improve mrs kleins 
condition 
the risk physically is equal to abort the child and carry the 
child to term short argued were saying nobody addressed the 
question of her psychological health were she to recover being 
told that her child is alive psychologically could only be a 
benefit telling her that they killed the child psychologically 
could be a disaster 
and if mrs klein should die short said why not let the baby 
be an extension of mrs kleins life 
the kleins have a 3yearold daughter

a prosecutor said he hopes the 2year prison 
sentence a preacher received for sodomizing two teenagers will help 
heal the emotional wounds suffered by the scores of boys the 
evangelist molested since the 1960s 
i think the victims kept a lot of things inside for a long 
time roanoke county assistant commonwealths attorney randy leach 
said tuesday after mario tony leyvas sentencing in circuit 
court 
leyva who could have been sentenced to 10 years in prison 
received 15 months for each of two counts of child sodomy 
the 43yearold selfordained pentecostal preacher from 
columbus ga apologized for lying when he testified in september 
that he had not committed any homosexual acts with minors 
but judge kenneth trabue chastized leyva upheld the penalty 
recommended by the jury and said he wished he could give the 
preacher even more time 
i suppose the thing that troubles me most is somebody of the 
cloth who knows the truth has openly and flagrantly lied trabue 
said there was an overt effort to poison the jury on your 
behalf 
leyva changed his story in october when he agreed to a plea 
bargain in a similar federal case in which he still faces 
sentencing he told the fbi he had molested at least 100 boys since 
the 1960s when he was a preacher in north carolina 
assistant us attorney jennie montgomery said leyva and two 
fellow pentecostal preachers rias edward morris and freddie m 
herring used leyvas traveling ministry to gain access to trouble 
boys they used for sex 
the three pleaded guilty in october to federal charges they 
shipped boys across state lines to use them in illegal sex acts in 
exchange for money and favors 
morris 47 was the organist in leyvas ministry herring 50 
founded the lighthouse assembly in douglasville ga 
under their plea bargains leyva faces a maximum prison sentence 
of 20 years and the other ministers 15 years 
leyva and the others who were not charged in the state case 
have been undergoing psychiatric evaluations at a federal prison in

a tv news editor hired away from his station 
by a competitor has been charged with unlawfully entering the 
computer system of his former employer to gain access to 
confidential information about news stories 
using knowledge of the system to bypass a security shield he 
helped create michael i shapiro examined and destroyed files 
relating to news stories at tampas wtvt according to the charges 
filed tuesday 
telephone records seized during shapiros arrest in clearwater 
showed he made several calls last month to the computer line at 
wtvt where he worked as assignment editor until joining competitor 
wtsp as an assistant news editor in october 
shapiro 33 was charged with 14 counts of computerrelated 
crimes grouped into three seconddegree felony categories offenses 
against intellectual property offenses against computer equipment 
and offenses against computer users he was released on his own 
recognizance from hillsborough county jail 
if convicted shapiro could be sentenced to up to 15 years in 
prison and be fined 10000 for each seconddegree felony count 
bob franklin wtvts interim news director said wtvt management 
discovered several computer files missing on jan 12 and shapiro was 
called to provide help but franklin said shapiro claimed not to 
know the cause of the problem 
subsequent investigation has revealed that at least since 
early january wtvts newsroom computer system had been the subject 
of repeated actual and attempted breakins the computers contain 
highly confidential information concerning the stations current and 
future news stories and the stations future story assignments 
franklin said in a statement read at a news conference 
franklin said shapiro was one of two people who has had 
responsibility for daily operation and maintenance of the computer 
system since it was installed about eight months ago 
the other is currently employed by us franklin said 
referring to systems operation manager cary williams 
terry cole news director at wtsp said shapiro has been placed 
on leave of absence from his job 
shapiro did not respond to messages left at wtsp asking for 
comment and the station would not give out his home phone number 
sam jones a spokesman for the florida department of law 
enforcement said the agencys investigation determined that shapiro 
gained access to wtvts computer on at least four occasions in 
january by placing telephone calls from the rival station and from 
his clearwater home where a computer and wtvts computer manual 
were found during a search tuesday 
there is no evidence or information to indicate that anyone 
else was involved other than mr shapiro jones said 
franklin said shapiro employed by wtvt from february 1986 to 
september 1988 was not fired from the station but rather left to 
advance his career at wtsp 
mike was a very competent assignment editor franklin said 
he was very good at what he did he left on good terms

a judge has warned berenice rogers 
to slip out of her high heels before strolling around her condo 
palm beach county circuit judge richard burk said tuesday that if 
rogers persists in annoying her downstairs neighbors with her noisy 
footsteps she could be pacing inside a jail cell 
bernard and sonja arbuse who live directly below rogers at the 
sun and surf condominium said the problem began in 1984 when rogers 
had italian tile laid in her 235000 condo 
the couples attorney charles nugent requested burk to order 
rogers to install carpeting 
rogers said she laid oriental and sheepskin rugs and removes her 
heels at the front door but she does not want carpet 
i dont believe mrs rogers is required to give up her right to 
decorate the judge said and i dont believe i can require her 
to stop walking

the trial of the nations largest sex 
discrimination salary case began with a state unions charge that 
california intentionally began paying women less than men in the 
early 1930s and never stopped 
the state explicitly considered sex when it overhauled its 
civil service classifications in 193031 said william dickens a 
labor economist who was the first witness at the trial tuesday 
dickens an associate professor of economics at the university of 
california at berkeley cited a 1930 report recommending the state 
pay somewhat higher for those occupations filled predominantly by 
men 
dickens was the leadoff witness for the california state 
employees association which is suing the state on behalf of 60000 
to 70000 past and present female employees 
deputy attorney general richard tullis defended the states wage 
system calling california a very progressive state 
us district judge marilyn hall patel hearing the case without 
a jury is limiting testimony in the first phase of the trial to the 
intent and effects of state policies in the 1930s when the current 
wage system is said to have originated 
the union must prove that when the states civil service 
commission reclassified jobs and pay scales it deliberately set 
wages for women at a lower rate than for men 
it must then prove that that early policy accounts for pay gaps 
existing at least through the 1970s 
lawyers for the state deny it ever had a policy of intentional 
pay discrimination and say any trace of bias was eliminated in a 
reorganization of job classifications in 193738 
dickens said the changes in state pay classifications in 193738 
were no more than an attempt to refine the system while leaving 
the basic structure in place 
state lawyers say damages in the case could run into the billions 
of dollars an estimate the union calls highly inflated

ferdinand marcos has ruled out any 
deals as the price for coming home and asked president corazon 
aquino to tell her relatives to stop bothering him about money 
matters an opposition senator said today 
sen juan ponce enrile said the ailing expresident made the 
statement to vice president salvador laurel in hawaii last thursday 
and asked that the message be relayed to mrs aquino 
laurel had told reporters saturday that he was carrying secret 
messages for mrs aquino from the hospitalized marcos who has asked 
to return from exile in hawaii to die in his homeland 
mrs aquino refused to see laurel and he has not disclosed the 
messages 
enrile however said laurel told him marcos wanted mrs aquino 
to instruct her relatives not to bother president marcos about 
money matters enrile said laurel told him of marcos remarks on 
sunday 
as far as i know according to the vice president marcos told 
him im not going to make any deals with anybody enrile told 
reporters 
last year mrs aquinos uncle rep francisco sumulong and a 
cousin rep egmidio tanjuatco visited the 71yearold marcos 
their visits and that of laurel prompted speculation marcos was 
prepared to negotiate 
the philippine government says marcos and his associates 
embezzled up to 10 billion before marcos was ousted in a february 
1986 civilianmilitary uprising mrs aquino has said the government 
will not discuss his return until he gives back the money 
in october a us grand jury indicted marcos and his wife imelda 
on racketeering charges for allegedly embezzling more than 100 
million and stashing much of it in the united states 
mrs aquino today said she told mateo caparas chairman of the 
presidential commission on good government to contact marcos 
representatives in the united states for a deal on marcos return 
but he caparas will not negotiate she told reporters i 
will see what they have to offer first of all and first of all if 
indeed they want to talk because to this date we have not received 
any letter authorizing certain persons to speak for mr marcos or 
mrs marcos 
teodoro locsin jr publisher of the philippine daily globe and 
mrs aquinos speechwriter today wrote that caparas told us 
justice department officials he was authorized to negotiate with 
marcos and demanded total discretion in his talks 
locsin said us officials warned caparas they would cease 
cooperation in investigations of marcos and seize his property in 
new york if manila reached an unacceptable agreement for his return 
the properties which the philippine government wants to sell are 
estimated at 300 million 
locsin quoted caparas as saying us officials had threatened to 
withhold evidence of marcos alleged secret bank accounts received 
from the swiss government 
locsin said us attorney charles labella of new york told 
caparas that us officials could also agree to a deal that would be 
unfavorable to manila 
caparas refused to return calls from the associated press 
in honolulus st francis medical center marcos remained in 
guarded condition connected to a respirator but a hospital 
spokeswoman reported his condition was improving 
he was admitted jan 15 and underwent a tracheotomy to drain 
fluid from his lungs he was hospitalized twice in december for 
congestive heart failure

rock hudson was guilty of immoral and indecent 
behavior for failing to tell his homosexual companion he had aids 
an attorney said in closing arguments in an 11 million lawsuit 
against the actors estate 
hudson did not give a damn about his lover marc christian or 
the countless other people who could have died christians 
lawyer harold rhoden said tuesday 
the duty to warn is what this case is all about someone who 
has aids has that duty its right it is decent it is moral 
rhoden said to do what rock hudson and mark miller his 
secretary did is immoral is indecent 
attorneys for hudsons estate and miller were to give closing 
arguments today in los angeles county superior court 
rhoden contends that christian 35 an aspiring musician who 
lived with hudson during the last two years of his life is entitled 
to compensation for the enhanced fear he suffered when he found 
out his lover had acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
christian testified last month he and hudson had unprotected oral 
and anal sex three to five times a week for eight months after 
hudson learned he had aids in june 1984 
hudson who played the leading man to such actresses as doris 
day elizabeth taylor and linda evans in movies and tv died oct 
5 1985 a few months after his battle with aids became public 
christian claims he did not find out hudson was dying of the disease 
until the public did 
miller who is being sued along with the estate for keeping 
hudsons secret contends that the movie star broke off his affair 
with christian before he knew he had the deadly disease 
rhoden has acknowledged christian has no symptoms of aids and 
tested negative for the virus but he maintains this is irrelevant 
because he says his client could develop aids at any time 
rhoden asked jurors to disregard defense claims that christian 
and hudson did not have sex reminding them that a witness had 
described seeing the two men in an amorous nude embrace at hudsons 
home after a party 
he also read passages from love letters hudson wrote to christian

thomas lee of haddonfield died tuesday at west jersey 
hospitalvoorhees after he was removed from a respirator said leon 
rose a lawyer for the youths parents frances and hsinyi lee 
the fbi has joined local and county officials in investigating 
whether the poisoning should be treated as a homicide suicide or 
producttampering case although they say the last choice is highly 
unlikely 
we are still in the investigation until such time that there is 
a determination made that it was not product tampering said fbi 
agent john h kundts of the bureaus philadelphia office he said 
the case would be presented to a grand jury feb 15 
cyanide was recovered from a rutgers university laboratory in 
camden where the boys father is a renowned biology professor and 
from the familys home but it remains unknown whether the samples 
matched cyanide found in the yogurt 
breyers makers of the yogurt said it determined the cyanide did 
not originate in any of its production facilities 
the teenager had been in critical condition since eating the 
black cherry yogurt on his way to school jan 3 doctors had given 
him little chance of recovery 
rose said the boys parents courtappointed guardian joseph

was no chance of a recovery to a cognitive and sapient state rose

guardian last month when it became evident his family would try to 
remove life support

talks between the opposition and government 
on ending of polands protracted economic crisis resumed today as a 
strike for higher pay closed a coal mine that supplies the countrys 
largest electric power plant 
a partial work stoppage that began monday at the belchatow 
bituminous coal mine and power plant 90 miles southwest of warsaw 
spread today to shut the mine at 1201 am state television and 
solidarity reported 
the government said the strike at the mine could eventually 
threaten power supplies in central poland but gave no details on 
when that might occur 
television said 4000 people were on strike while the free trade 
union movements information service in warsaw said the number was 
8000 
the complex employs 12000 workers 
at the council of ministers palace 40 people from the government 
and opposition began work on seeking a national consensus on 
economic reform and social policy 
the working group meeting is part of roundtable negotiations 
that began monday and are expected to last up to six weeks 
solidarity wants the talks first to lead to the restoration of 
its legal status after a sevenyear ban 
at the opening session the government said solidarity could be 
reinstated if the opposition agrees take seats in partliament which 
communist authorities would still control 
opposition leaders have balked at the proposal as an attempt to 
make them share responsibility for austerity measures they would be 
denied a role in formulating 
the working group that met today is the first of three to start 
negotiations since mondays inaugural session solidarity chairman 
lech walesa and interior minister czeslaw kiszczak who led their 
opposition and government delegations at mondays talks were not 
present at todays meeting 
a working group on trade unions is to begin meeting thursday and 
a group on political reforms on friday 
wladyslaw baka the member of the ruling politburo responsible 
for the economy and witold trzeciakowski an economist on a 
citizens group formed by walesa were the senior participants at 
the talks 
other government participants were industry minister mieczyslaw 
wilczek and deputy prime minister ireneusz sekula for the 
opposition participants included ryszard bugaj an independent 
economist and gabriel janowski of the farmers opposition group 
rural solidarity 
chief government spokesman jerzy urban said opposition 
participants at the negotiations would not be asked to intervene to 
stop the belchatow strike but walesa sent a representative to the 
strikers in an apparent bid to moderate the dispute 
the strike because of its timing as the longawaited talks get 
started appears politically delicate for both the opposition and 
authorities 
communist party officials entered the talks despite internal 
opposition from hardliners arguing that an agreement with 
solidarity would help keep labor peace 
it appeared the strike begun by local solidarity activists 
could become a test of the national leaderships ability to fulfill 
that implied promise 
the workers seek a 59 monthly pay increase at a time of 60 
percent inflation and chronic consumer shortages 
the workers current wages are not known 
on tuesday urban said 173 pay disputes were reported nationwide 
in january three times higher than december and that alarming 
wage pressures led to 39 strikes last month 
the complex where todays strike was occurring is part of a 
public coalandpower monopoly formed last year during a government 
restructuring program that removed some industry from state control 
the government has warned against enterprises paying wages that 
exceed their financial earnings raises are supposed to come out of 
higher productivity

chances of reaching the irs tollfree telephone 
line with a question about taxes have improved but at last check 
the odds of getting a correct answer had not 
clearly there is room for improvement the general accounting 
office said in a report on its survey which found internal revenue 
service telephone assistors gave the right answer on only 64 
percent of 20 test questions that were asked in 1776 calls 
the irs says its accuracy rate should not be judged solely on the 
basis of a test survey and promises its assistors are better 
equipped to give the right answer in the current filing season 
which ends april 17 
gao an arm of congress called 29 irs offices during last years 
filing season the results made public tuesday 
callers got through on the first try on 76 percent of the calls 
up markedly from 61 percent in 1987 on calls requiring five 
attempts the success rate rose to 93 percent from 88 percent a 
year earlier 
1733 questions were answered 
1110 answers 64 percent were correct although 111 6 percent 
of the total were incomplete 
623 answers 36 percent were wrong 
the irs answered a capitalgains question wrong 67 percent of the 
time childcare credit 64 percent taxability of scholarships 60 
percent irs assistors gave the right answer only half the time on 
deducting personal interest 
gao said it could not compare the accuracy rate of the latest 
survey with earlier tests because questions were different 
however gao was given correct answers to 79 percent of its 
questions in 1987 
the irs did its own survey last filing season checking answers 
to actual taxpayer calls and finding 724 percent accuracy 
a key reason for the inaccuracies that gao found last year was 
that 17 of the 20 test questions required the irs assistor to ask 
the caller for more details and the assistors failed to do so 
probing is important because taxpayers who call with questions 
frequently are not sufficiently familiar with the tax laws to 
initially provide assistors with all the information needed to 
answer their questions correctly gao wrote 
on questions affected by recent tax law changes especially the 
landmark 1986 overhaul the irs gave the right answer to gao 59 
percent of the time irs was right on 72 percent of questions not 
affected by change 
gao emphasized that the inaccuracy rate applies only to the 
specific questions that were asked in the survey not necessarily 
to all the questions that taxpayers are likely to ask 
irs commissioner lawrence b gibbs said that in preparing for the 
current filing season we have expanded assistor training on 
probing skills in addition we continue to emphasize to all 
managers the need for quality review and providing immediate 
feedback to assistors who fail to probe completely 
the irs answered 20 million calls on the 4359 tollfree 
assistance lines last year that represented about 85 percent of the 
direct contact the irs had with taxpayers 
in most areas the irs answer line may be reached by dialing 
18004241040 but there are different numbers in many locations 
the numbers are listed on page 48 of the form 1040a instructions and 
page 52 of form 1040 instructions 
most telephoned questions are answered by frontline 
assistors who often are parttime employees earning between 650 
and 1170 an hour if they cannot answer a question they are 
supposed to turn the caller over to a backup assistor who has 
received more training has more reference material close at hand 
and who is paid as much as 1432 an hour 
however the gao survey indicated the backup assistors gave the 
wrong answer to 40 percent of the questions compared with 35 
percent for the frontline employees gao said that could be because 
the backup assistors had to answer the more difficult questions

a man accused of strangling a pregnant doctor in 
her bellevue hospital office used to wander the halls in surgical 
scrubs and went into operating rooms unhindered during surgery a 
newspaper reported today 
meanwhile a bellevue nurses aide who police believe steven 
smith had picked out as his second victim said smith sweettalked 
her and then hounded her when he learned she had a boyfriend 
he wanted all my time said the aide viola durham i 
ignored it he never threatened me 
smith is charged with raping and murdering pathologist kathryn 
hinnant on jan 7 
a detectives report filed monday said smith told police that 
there was a girl known to him as viola that was his age who 
could well have been his next victim ms durham said she was 
shocked by the report 
new york newsday reported today that police believe that smith 
often walked around the hospital in hospital pajamas or surgical 
scrubs ate in the staff cafeteria and slept in various hospital 
rooms 
when he allegedly killed hinnant smith was wearing a white lab 
coat over surgical scrubs and had a stethoscope draped around his 
neck police said 
several hospital employees told police that smith apparently was 
not asked to leave the operating rooms newsday said citing 
unidentified sources 
bellevue spokesman al palmieri said he doubted the reports 
i think its unlikely even if he was dressed in surgical greens 
with a mask on that he would be allowed to be in an operating room 
just standing around he said 
we do have some operating rooms that allow for external 
observation thats a possibility

iranian leaders of all stripes are calling 
for greater political and social freedom now that the war with iraq 
appears over and the islamic revolution reaches its 10th anniversary 
feb 11 
as the country prepares to face the challenges of peace after 
eight years of war in the persian gulf progressive religious 
figures are urging fresh interpretations of the sharia islams 
religious laws and cornerstone of irans rigid political and social 
system 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini irans supreme authority has thrown 
his weight behind the trend 
in a decree jan 4 he stressed the need for islam to adapt to 
the modern world his decree was seen as one of his most important 
pronouncements since the revolution that toppled shah mohammad reza 
pahlavi in 1979 
he called on the conservative council of guardians which has 
repeatedly blocked key economic legislation on the grounds it 
violated islams tenets to avoid obscure theological arguments that 
will drive us to dead ends 
khomeini 88 years old was reflecting a groundswell of sentiment 
among influential religious and political leaders seeking to move 
iran toward a decade of dawn 
the revolutionary patriarch who during the war with iraq 
repeatedly appealed to his bickering officials for unity refused 
requests in november that he settle a fierce debate over economic 
policy he urged open discussion 
he decreed that academic argument should be given a high place 
in islam and encouraged rather than suppressed because of 
dogmatic interpretations and authoritarian outlooks 
today tehran radio announced that khomeini has pardoned an 
unspecified number of political prisoners in iran in a general 
amnesty it said the government determined they no longer 
constitute a threat to the revolution 
however these progressive moves are taking place at the same 
time as a new wave of dissident executions in which by most 
accounts hundreds have died 
the executions along with the prospect of a power struggle for 
supremacy in the postkhomeini era and the influence among 50 
million iranians of the deeply entrenched mullahs or shiite moslem 
priests have made many people skeptical about just how far iran 
will progress along a progressive course 
travellers from tehran the capital say many iranians refer to 
the next 10 years the decade of dawn to officials as the decade 
of suffering 
nonetheless there are clear indications the winds of change are 
blowing stronger 
freedom of expression and other liberties were widely restricted 
during the persian gulf war but with the casefire restrictions 
appear to have been relaxed 
hojatoleslam mohammad javad hojati kermani a middleranking 
cleric who has become irans most popular newspaper columnist 
recently chided traditionalist mullahs 
in the same way that permitting what god has forbidden is 
forbidden forbidding what god has permitted is also forbidden he 
wrote in tehrans ettelaat newspaper 
i am puzzled why our religious authorities consider the safe 
course to be obsessively guarding the fortress of what has been 
forbidden rather than guarding the flower garden of what is indeed 
permitted by god 
parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani viewed as the governments 
leading pragmatist and architect of efforts to open up iran after a 
decade of isolation noted in a recent speech we still have a lot 
of unanswered questions with regard to society 
we have not come forward with clear principles in our foreign 
policy or in religious matters that vastly differ today from 
earlier eras of islam 
after the sacrifices of the war in which by some estimates 1 
million iranians were killed iranians want to enjoy the fruits of 
peace 
scheherazade daneshku a parisbased iranian analyst noted that 
leaders like rafsanjani understand that now some of the more 
puritanical and uncompromising aspects of islamic rule will almost 
certainly have to be dispensed with 
khomeinis designated successor ayatollah husseinali montazeri 
who has long urged wider freedoms told islamic students last 
october freedom of expression is the natural and 
constitutional right of every individual 
the officials of this country and the revolution who 
experienced the bitter taste of repression under the monarchy 
should take notice of this and avoid the assumption we no longer 
need freedom of expression 
montazeri warned should we grow intolerant to challenges to 
our ideas these challenges will inevitably turn into bullets 
parliament member elias hazrati declared during a debate on 
postwar reconstruction and the future shape of society ten years 
after the revolution we have to bitterly admit that we have not 
been successful in developing and reforming the systems we inherited 
from the former regime 
cleric kermani noted in one of his columns there are still 
people who refuse to listen to the radio watch television or 
believe that women should not participate in marches and friday 
prayers let alone parliament 
some citizens are still heard complaining about the songs aired 
on the radio and tv they are against women appearing on television 
as newscasters interviewers and actresses and doubt the 
advisability of consorting with foreign nonmoslems infidels 
communists and women who do not wear the chador cloaklike dress 
khomeini said in a letter oct5 to hojatoleslam mohammad hussein 
qadiri a senior religious scholar at the qom seminary who 
questioned the ayatollahs ruling that chess and musical instruments 
were permissible under islamic law according to your reverences 
interpretation of the hagiological tradition modern civilization 
should be destroyed and people should go back to mud huts or live in 
deserts forever 
khomeini urged qadiri to avoid being affected by sanctimonious 
and illiterate mullahs whom many iranians criticize for burying 
religion in inflexible tenets and medieval interpretations of the 
koran islams holy book 
kermani noted that khomeinis precepts are the start of a new 
revolution in our deeprooted traditional theology now is 
the time to explicitly say that there must be a transformation a 
revolution in the way that the huge resources of the rich shiite 
theology are being exploited 
he said the brand of theology presented by backwardlooking 
clerics is not capable of managing a home or a village let alone 
a country 
mohammad hashemi rafsanjanis brother and head of the staterun 
television and radio network called in a november for greater media 
freedom to air grievances and criticism of the government 
official action he added in an interview published by his 
networks soroush magazine had prevented his organization from 
doing our duty in reflecting criticisms to the extent that our 
mission requires 
soroush also carried an interview with mahdi nasari 
editorinchief of kayhan irans largest selling newspaper in 
which he said the press has not done enough to criticize the 
revolutions shortcomings 
if a society is deprived of the blessing of criticism and 
critical encounters throughout the mass media then it can be 
said that it is a society facing gradual death and at the very 
least decline he said

crashes of aeroflot planes killed 85 people in 
1988 far more than the previous year the chief pilot for the 
staterun airline said today 
the pilot mikhail m tereshenko announced the statistic at a 
news conference to mark the 66th anniversary of the huge airline 
he said the fatalities occurred in 16 crashes and that the death 
toll did not include people killed in hijackings in 1988 
in march a family of 11 siberian jazz musicians commandeered an 
aerflot plane flying from siberia to leningrad they killed a flight 
attendent and three passengers and four hijackers committed suicide 
after killing their mother the soviet press has reported 
in 1987 tereshenko said 18 people died in 13 crashes 
at a news conference in february 1988 vladimir y potemkin 
deputy chief of flight services said 47 aeroflot passengers and 
crew members were killed in accidents in 1987 it was not 
immediately clear why the figures are different 
aeroflot began releasing details of its safety record only last 
year another example of soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs 
campaign for glasnost or more openness on some issues 
the campaign has also brought a flurry of reports and letters in 
the official soviet press complaining about aeroflot 
boris e panyukov first deputy civil aviation minister said at 
todays news conference there were 13 million unsatisfied people 
among aeroflots 124 million passengers in 1988 he did not give a 
detailed breakdown 
aeroflot which has a monopoly on domestic flights is notorious 
for delays and poor service 
a soviet newspaper reported last week that 120 angry aeroflot 
passengers refused to leave a plane for hours after they were told 
to disembark before their destination

north korean delegates today demanded a 
halt to joint ussouth korean military exercises and told southern 
delegates the maneuvers are blocking dialogue between north and 
south 
delegates from both sides met nearly two hours in an attempt to 
set down terms for the first meeting of their prime ministers they 
didnt agree on anything except the date for their next meeting 
march 2 
the fivemember delegations exchanged testy statements over north 
koreas demand for the halt to the annual ussouth korea team 
spirit exercises north korea says they are war preparations 
each side accused the other of blocking progress 
the south korean side did not show sincerity at todays 
meeting we hope they will come to the next meeting with a sure 
answer north koreas chief delegate paik nam jun told reporters 
south koreas senior delegate song hanho accused north korea 
of being insincere saying their demand for a halt to the 
exercises seems to be a precondition to dialogue 
paik demanded soon after the meeting opened that the exercises be 
halted the exercises which are heightening tension to an extreme 
level and deepening distrust and misunderstanding must be stopped 
immediately and unconditionally he said 
the exercises are an obstacle to dialogue he added 
the norths official pyongyang radio said northern delegates will 
boycott preliminary parliamentary talks originally scheduled 
friday until the exercises are over 
the radio monitored in tokyo quoted an unidentified north 
korean spokesman as saying the north wanted the question of stopping 
the exercises on the talks agenda and that holding the talks as 
scheduled would be difficult since the exercises have already begun

northsouth parliamentary negotiations on such issues as a 
nonaggression pact 
todays meeting was called to set the terms for a meeting of the 
two nations prime ministers for the first time since the division 
of their land 44 years ago the prime ministers talks if held 
would be the highestlevel discussions between the two koreas 
the delegates exchanged handshakes with broad smiles before 
starting the talks today but the cordinal mood quickly dissipated 
the chief south korean negotiator said the joint exercises 
conducted annually since 1976 were defensive in nature and an 
inappropriate subject for discussion at the talks 
he said the exercises could be modified or stopped if the leaders 
of the two koreas were to meet and resolve their basic differences 
north korea said it would not object to training exercises by 
south korean forces but did not want further joint ussouth korea

the moscowbacked regime says it has 
armed 30000 supporters in kabul and thousands more in outlying 
towns so they can defend themselves against a guerrilla onslaught 
when the soviet pullout is complete 
in moscow a foreign ministry official said tuesday about 15000 
soviet soldiers had been killed in afghanistan nearly 2000 more 
than the kremlin reported in may when the soviets last gave a 
figure 
this indicated heavy losses during the withdrawal but the 
official yuri k alexeyev said it doesnt mean that during the 
last months we had the bloodiest period of the war in afghanistan 
an air crew in the pakistani capital islamabad cited security 
and refused to fly a jet transport packed with 32 tons of food and 
medicine to begin the un airlift to the besieged afghan capital 
kabul un officials said 
with the deadline for a soviet pullout only a week away members 
of the ruling party have been armed to defend their homes 
neighborhoods and towns foreign ministry spokesman nabi amani told 
reporters tuesday 
party members look on their weapons as their pride he said 
amani said 45000 additional party members who have finished 
compulsory military service volunteered for reserve duty or for 
selfdefense and border units including 5000 women assigned to 
noncombat units 
president najib told commanders of tribal and militia units 
tuesday that once the withdrawal of soviet forces is complete you 
are now on your own feet defending your freeborn and beloved 
motherland the british broadcasting corp reported 
it quoted najib as saying extremist foes were not ready to 
give up the selfish interest of themselves and their foreign 
supporters 
in moscow foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov told 
reporters tuesday that food supplies had improved in kabul but the 
fuel shortage was critical soviet aircraft are airlifting flour and 
fuel to kabul 
meanwhile a spokesman for the 11 billion un reconstruction 
program for afghanistan said today that the first plane scheduled in 
the un airlift would remain on the tarmac until at least thursday 
the crew of the chartered egypt air boeing 707 called off the 
flight for security reasons said the official rene albeck 
the plane was to leave tuesday now we are working on the 
possibility of having another airline do the job we have not 
dropped the idea of the airlift 
sadruddin aga khan the un aid coordinator for afghanistan in 
a statement from geneva expressed deep regret at egypt airs 
decision and said the united nations does not share the 
apprehensions 
moslem insurgents have agreed in principle not to attack un 
flights the assurance was given in exchange for a promise that un 
convoys would carry supplies to guerrillaheld regions un 
officials say 
an estimated 350000 people in kabuls slums have little or no 
food and fuel in one of the harshest winters in years about 2 
million residents and refugees crowd the capital which is 
surrounded by guerrillas 
afghanistan has been torn by civil war since a 1978 communist 
coup prompted a moslem insurgency soviet troops intervened a year 
later replacing one promoscow regime with another 
the soviet withdrawal began may 15 and is to be complete by feb 
15 under a unmediated agreement however kremlin officials say 
all soviet forces will be gone by the end of this week 
about 1000 soviet soldiers remain in kabul guarding the airport 
guerrillas and many western analysts predict najibs government 
will collapse soon after they withdraw the president says his 
conscript army is strong enough to defeat the insurgents

no matter what level of income and education they 
achieve blacks arent as readily accepted in white neighborhoods as 
hispanics and asians suggesting the american dream is not a 
viable option for blacks researchers say 
hispanics and asians move easily into the us mainstream as they 
get more schooling better jobs and higher income according to the 
study by two university of chicago researchers in todays edition of 
social science quarterly 
the study said figures show that integration is possible even 
likely for all ethnic and racial groups except blacks 
it said an asian or hispanic who has completed the third grade is 
more likely to live in an integrated neighborhood than a black with 
a doctorate 
and an asian or hispanic who makes less than 2500 has a higher 
chance of living in an integrated neighborhood than a black who 
earns more than 50000 the researchers found 
the implications of these findings for blacks are troublesome 
given the civil rights legislation of recent decades said nancy 
denton a demographer who worked on the study with sociology 
professor douglas massey 
the american dream of working ones way up is not a viable 
option for blacks in the united states at least in terms of 
residence she said in a telephone interview tuesday 
no matter what their education or occupational achievements 
blacks are exposed to higher crime rates less effective educational 
systems higher mortality risks more dilapidated surroundings and a 
poorer socioeconomic environment than whites simply because of the 
persistence of strong barriers to residential integration denton 
said in the study 
she said the study is the first national one to compare 
segregation patterns for three minority groups in the 20 
metropolitan areas where each of the three minority groups has the 
largest populations it used data from the 1980 census the first 
with detailed statistics on americans growing asian population 
an earlier study on how social and economic status affects 
segregation in typical us neighborhoods found integration 
improved modestly from 1970 to 1980 
michael white a researcher at the urban institute in washington 
who worked on that study said researchers came to the conclusion in 
the 1950s and 60s that segregation wasnt substantially linked to 
socialeconomic differences 
he said that further studies including dentons help policy 
makers understand who is segregated by how much and what are some 
of the reasons for that 
the latest study said that although blacks ability to integrate 
rises as their socioeconomic status rises the difference is 
generally trivial 
for blacks of all social backgrounds integration remains an 
elusive goal the study said

attorney general dick thornburghs bluechip 
stock portfolio already has prompted his withdrawal from several 
cases and could disqualify him from participation in a broad range 
of future issues 
thornburghs holdings include stock in amoco corp atlantic 
richfield general motors general electric ibm international 
paper johnson amp johnson and mobil corp 
the financial disclosure report thornburgh filed with the office 
of government ethics shows his stock portfolio contains holdings 
from a crosssection of americas largest corporations 
the list also includes aluminum company of america allied 
signal procter amp gamble rockwell international and sears roebuck 
thornburghs net worth was valued between 500000 and 700000 
at the time of his confirmation last summer by the senate said 
david runkel an aide to the attorney general 
the extent and character of thornburghs investments have the 
potential to disqualify him from participating in a number of major 
decisions as cases arise runkel conceded 
any of the numerous companies in which thornburgh holds stock 
could become involved in dealings with the justice department as a 
result of antipollution enforcement government contracts 
antitrust investigations or merger reviews 
records kept by the attorney generals office show that 
thornburgh already has recused himself from several legal cases or 
policy issues involving corporations in which he owns stock 
notably thornburgh issued a blanket recusal from any decisions 
involving the continued enforcement of the atampt divestiture consent 
decree because he owns at least 5000 worth of the companys stock 
thornburgh is the third straight attorney general held ineligible 
by department rules to play a role in the continued legal battles 
resulting from the atampt breakup 
william french smith who was president reagans first attorney 
general had been a director of pacific bell before taking office 
in 1981 smith and his wife placed their stock and bond holdings 
worth at least 23 million into blind trusts 
smiths successor edwin meese iii was criticized last month by 
an internal justice department report for participating in atampt 
policy discussions when he held stock in the bell regional operating 
companies 
before his confirmation thornburgh pledged to develop a recusal 
policy and to survey the various justice department divisions to 
identify any cases or issues that might pose a conflict of interest 
he also agreed to resign as a corporate director of rite aid 
corp merrill lynch amp co inc and arco chemical co 
under the recusal policy subsequently formulated thornburgh told 
justice department officials that i will not participate in any 
matter in which i am aware that i have a financial interest unless 
i have obtained a waiver of the disqualification 
federal ethics law entitles officials to obtain the waivers if 
appropriate 
but runkel said thornburgh has not sought any waivers saying the 
device would be used sparingly if at all 
thornburgh also recused himself from participating in the 
antitrust divisions review of schindler holding corps proposal to 
buy the elevator manufacturing component of westinghouse electric 
corp 
thornburgh who owns at least 15000 worth of westinghouse 
stock is also recused from participating in any litigation that 
might arise from the cleanup of an energy department nuclearweapons 
plant in fernald ohio operated by westinghouse 
the attorney general also barred himself from participation in 
decisions involving a longstanding lawsuit against the comptroller 
of the currency for allowing citicorp to acquire and operate a 
municipal bond insurance company 
the justice department successfully defended the lawsuit filed 
by an insurance trade association thornburgh owns at least 5000 
worth of citicorp stock and holds at least 5000 worth of notes 
issued by the bank holding company 
he is also recused from any discussions about whether the food 
and drug administration should involve itself in the implementation 
of a california law requiring extensive notices of toxic chemicals 
in consumer products and food 
this recusal stems from thornburghs largest single holding a 
block of stock in hj heinz co worth more than 50000 
in addition the attorney general has told justice department 
officials he will consider recusing himself from matters that 
involve his former pittsburgh law firm kirkpatrick and lockhart 
accordingly thornburgh has recused himself from any litigation 
involving the jan 2 1988 fueltank spill near pittsburgh because 
the law firm is representing ashland oil co 
thornburgh has also recused himself from reviewing grant 
applications from harvard university where his wife ginny works 
as the universitys advocate for the handicapped 
before becoming attorney general thornburgh headed the institute 
of politics at harvards john f kennedy school of government

police officers gang workers and a gang 
member expressed skepticism that the citys ban on militarystyle 
rifles will curb violence 
the city council on tuesday unanimously voted to outlaw 
immediately the sale or possession of semiautomatic weapons like the 
ak47 assault rifle that was used to kill five children in a 
stockton schoolyard jan 17 
mayor tom bradley called the weapons tools of murder and mayhem 
whose sole purpose is killing human beings and signed the measure 
into law 
owners of such weapons have 15 days to either dispose of them or 
render them inoperable violators face up to six months in jail and 
a fine of up to 1000 
the law applies to any semiautomatic rifle that holds 20 or more 
rounds or a semiautomatic shotgun that can be fired more than six 
times 
rick lil loc 2 hardson who identified himself as a member of 
the crips four trey gang said the ban probably wouldnt deter gang 
members from acquiring semiautomatic weapons he said such guns can 
be purchased on the street from drug addicts for as little as 30 
as for gang members theyll say well a gun is illegal 
so what everything they do is illegal the 18yearold said 
steve valdivia head of the citys community youth gang services 
said that he supports the new law but that assault rifles are not 
used as frequently as other weapons in gang slayings 
the director of californians against handgun violence praised the 
ban we think its a terrific thing that theyre doing said 
luis tolley even if it proves to be merely symbolic its still a 
very important message 
detective jimmy l trahin called the ban an overreaction if 
they want to do something dont attack the gun attack the guy 
whos using it in a crime trahin said 
the stockton city council unanimously adopted an ordinance monday 
banning assault rifles despite protests from gun owners who argued 
that the measure was unconstitutional

some airline passengers in nonsmoking sections 
breathe as much nicotine from cigarette smoke as those in smoking 
sections researchers say 
a new study also said nicotine levels in older aircraft that 
circulate fresh air are lower than in newer planes that recirculate 
cabin air 
the researchers writing in fridays journal of the american 
medical association studied nicotine levels in five passengers and 
four flight attendants after four flights averaging four hours each 
air nicotine levels in the nonsmoking areas that border the 
smoking area may be at least as high as in similar indoor 
environments frequented by smokers wrote margaret mattson a 
national cancer institute researcher and her colleagues 
the maximum number of people smoking at any one time was eight 
and the average was around four the researchers said 
the subjects carried monitors that measured nicotine exposure 
during the flight and their urine was analyzed for nicotine content 
for 72 hours after landing 
passengers in smoking sections were exposed to between 03 and 
586 micrograms of nicotine per cubic meter of air with a median of 
12 the study said 
those sitting in the nonsmoking section were exposed to between 
01 and 710 micrograms per cubic meter with a median of 2 the 
study said 
this bears out travelers anecdotal observations that the 
section in which one sits is often not as important in determining 
exposure to smoke as is the environment generated by ones 
neighbors the researchers wrote 
two of the flights were on boeing 727s which circulate 100 
percent fresh air and two were on newer boeing 767s which 
recirculate half their air 
the researchers said passengers faced significantly less nicotine 
exposure in the planes circulating only fresh air

warning christians of hypocrisy and of falling for ideologies and 
fads 
in todays comments during his general audience he said lent a 
period of fasting and penitence before easter should bring a 
purification of the heart 
john paul also observed ash wednesday the opening day of lent 
with an afternoon mass at the 5thcentury saint sabina church 
the pope said purification of the heart calls for pure 
thoughts intentions desires and passions so that our external 
behavior is really sincere and not the fruit of that hypocrisy and 
human glory against which christ was so severe 
the subtle temptation for us christians is that of appearing 
christian without really being so stooping to pacts with ideologies 
and with the fads of this world the pope told several thousand

country to take control of news media properties

fund said he is considering the purchase of other news media 
properties in alabama and in other states he said there is a 
great market for media acquisitions

parade floats yielded to streetsweeping 
machines and garbage trucks today as new orleans sobered up from a 
mardi gras tamed somewhat by the cold 
for many the onset of lent today did not stop the partying from 
continuing inside the bistros in the french quarter safe from the 
nearfreezing weather that kept mardi gras attendance below the 
expected 17 million people 
i love new orleans and mardi gras is the most wonderful thing 
on earth kerri rock 27 shouted late tuesday night over the din 
in ryans 500 pub on bourbon street 
miss rock said her costume was a nuns habit and the results 
were startling 
ive never had so many invitations from men wanting to go out 
with me its disgusting she said 
one paradegoer was shot to death during a sunday night holdup 
the only violent crime reported during the final weekend of 
carnival said police spokesman john bryson 
bryson said the only other casualties were a woman who broke the 
fall of a rider who fell from his float and two people struck by the 
prized gilded coconuts tossed by the zulu marching society 
nothing serious he said 
attendance figures were not immediately available 
the partying officially ended at midnight when streetsweeping 
machines preceded by mounted police purged the french quarter 
each year the city weighs the collected garbage to help measure 
attendance city officials plan to release this years figures in 
the next day or two 
twelve parades with more than 400 floats rolled through new 
orleans and its suburbs witnessed by wellinsulated but 
enthusiastic crowds 
clarinetist pete fountain and his halffast marching club helped 
launch the celebrating on historic st charles avenue followed by 
floats carrying zulus blackfaced black men spoofing carnival high 
society and rex monarch of mardi gras 
floats seemed to move swifter than usual through the streets as 
riders tossed doubloons plastic beads and other carnival souvenirs 
to the crowds 
to squelch one trend the city council earlier this year forbade 
the throwing of mice and other live animals from carnival floats 
costumes ranged from the bizarre and immodest men in lingerie 
and barebreasted women to the more traditional families of clowns 
and clusters of cockroaches people blamed temperatures that ranged 
from the high 20s to about 45 degrees for this years scant supply 
of bare flesh 
this ones been a little too cold but its still been a lot of 
fun were drinking whisky to keep us warm said barbara rusina a

at least one palestinian prisoner was killed and 
14 were injured today when army guards fired tear gas plastic 
bullets and live ammunition to quell a riot in a military prison 
army sources said 
a palestinian teenager was reported shot to death today in the 
occupied lands and a palestinian died of injuries suffered earlier 
in the uprising 
israeli government and military officials rejected the 
conclusions of a us state department report alleging substantial 
human rights violations and said the report ignored the context of 
the uprising 
the us report released tuesday says methods used by the army 
to halt the 14month revolt have resulted in many avoidable deaths 
and injuries 
army sources who insisted on anonymity said the unrest at the 
military prison in megiddo in northern israel began outside when 
visiting relatives went on a rampage raising palestinian flags and 
stoning soldiers parked cars 
when guards suspended visiting hours inmates began rioting the 
sources said as prisoners returned to cells they stirred up 
others and a serious riot started inside the cells which is still 
continuing the sources said 
they said military guards fired tear gas and plastic bullets to 
try to end the rioting when that failed the guards opened fire 
with live ammunition they said resulting in the death and injuries 
an army official later said the riot was brought under control 
and an investigation was begun 
in the west bank village of kabatiya arab hospital officials 
said 16yearold jamal salim zakarni died after being shot in the 
stomach during a clash with troops a military spokeswoman said she 
was checking the report 
the army confirmed the death of 20yearold akram abu nahla a 
resident of the rafah refugee camp in the gaza strip who died in a 
tel aviv hospital 
a military spokeswoman said the circumstances of the death were 
not clear a gaza city reporter said abu nahla was shot in the head 
with a plastic bullet tuesday during a demonstration 
the three deaths raised to 377 the number of palestinians killed 
since the uprising began dec 7 1987 fifteen israelis have died 
in spite of the constant provocations the israel defense force 
scrupulously maintains moral norms and human rights and treats any 
exceptions with utmost severity the foreign ministry said in 
reponse to the state departments annual report on human rights 
worldwide 
the report does not take into consideration the overall context 
of the events and continuing provocations the extreme elements 
directing the events use violence meant to be lethal the 
statement said 
the report alleged that israels response to the uprising led 
to a substantial increase in human rights violations 
soldiers frequently used gunfire in situations that did not 
present mortal danger to troops causing many avoidable deaths and 
injuries it said 
it also said troops often arrest palestinians without warrants 
and demolish houses of people suspected but not convicted of 
antiisraeli violence 
yossi sarid a parliament member of the liberal citizens rights 
movement said the report was generally accurate 
i am so sorry that in order to see our face we need a mirror 
held from so far away he said on israel radio 
jonathan kuttab cofounder of the human rights monitoring group 
al haqlaw in the service of man said he hoped the us government 
would reassess its 3 billion annual aid to israel in light of the 
findings its a matter of american dollars not going to a country 
that systematically violates human rights said kuttab a 
palestinianamerican lawyer 
but the military chief prosecutor brig gen amnon strashnov 
told israeli television the report was exaggerated and unjust 
strashnov said that of 21000 palestinians arrested since the 
start of the uprising 8000 have been indicted of those 4300 
have been been convicted and 200 acquitted strashnov said others 
were awaiting trial he said 
he said about 50 israeli soldiers have been tried or are facing 
prosecution for violating army orders

the university of louisville has softened 
its proposed nosmoking rules bowing to threats of budgetary 
reprisals from legislators in a state where tobacco is a 2 billion 
industry 
university president donald swain said tuesday the new policy 
which takes effect march 1 abandons a provision that all 
irreconcilable conflicts between smokers and nonsmokers be 
resolved in favor of nonsmokers 
the original policy on smoking was drafted last fall but never 
went into effect at the university where 22000 students are 
enrolled some legislators had threatened the university with a loss 
in state support 
weve tried to address all concerns including those of the 
legislators swain said 
there was concern within the university that smokers be treated 
with some balance we were concerned that the previous policy was a 
little onesided 
swain said the revised policy directs department heads to discuss 
and settle conflicts with employees 
the policy also drops a ban on smoking in open work areas 
directing instead that such areas be separated into smoking and 
nonsmoking areas or be designated one or the other after 
discussions with the affected employees 
state rep donnie gedling chairman of the legislatures tobacco 
task force and an outspoken opponent of the universitys earlier 
proposal said of the changes i could live with that without any 
problem 
if its fair to smokers thats what we want to look at he 
said 
another key legislator house agriculture committee chairman clay 
crupper said any smoking policy was inappropriate for a public 
institution in a tobaccogrowing state i didnt think they needed 
any regulation he said 
kentucky the nations top burley tobacco producer had the 
countrys highest smokingrelated death rate in 1985 the us 
centers for disease control reported in november

turkeys trotting into traffic and chasing 
humans near plymouth rock are giving state officials problems the 
pilgrims never dreamed of 
wildlife workers trying to restore the wild turkey population 
that has been a part of state lore since the first thanksgiving say 
tame turkeys are becoming a nuisance in the suburbs and threaten to 
dilute the wild breeding stock 
one chased an old lady at a bird feeder some others got onto 
route 128 and almost caused an automobile accident james cardoza 
head of the states wild turkey restoration project said tuesday 
richard turner said he received a complaint from the owner of a 
mercedes who found a turkey trotting over the hood and roof of his 
expensive car 
turner said the birds are apparently penraised wild turkeys that 
have been freed and dont have the wily instincts of their wild 
counterparts 
although it is illegal chicks are sometimes sold at county fairs 
and unsupecting people have bought them thinking it would be nice 
to have some wild turkeys in their yard turner said 
the problem according to the biologists is that the penreared 
turkeys could breed with the wild turkeys the state is trying to 
reintroduce to areas south of boston 
in other words they say the wild turkeys could become just as 
dumb as the tame turkeys 
cardoza estimated that the population of tame turkeys on the 
loose was less than 50 
the states wild turkey restoration effort began in 1972 with the 
release in the berkshires of a few pairs of wild birds captured in 
new york since then the number of wild turkeys in the states 
western mountains has grown to about 5000 
for the past nine years the birds have been numerous enough in 
some areas to allow hunting

north korea and cuba are the world worst 
violators of human rights because they have established systems of 
total repression a top state department official said today 
assistant secretary of state richard schifter offered that 
assessment on the occasion of the release of the state departments 
annual human rights report which strikes a positive note about the 
soviet union but harsh criticism about israel 
schifter who heads the state departments human rights bureau 
said under questioning that his assessment consistent with previous 
years is that cuba and north korea are the worlds most repressive 
states 
what we are talking about here is total repression schifter 
said 
in north korea he said the government tries really to turn 
people into automatons 
as far as cuba is concerned there is an effort there to try to 
achieve the same thing in terms of total penetration of the country 
by secret police truly spying on every citizen he said 
the human rights reports section on the soviet union said 
president mikhail gorbachevs reforms offer cautious hope for a 
better day 
but it says the palestinian uprising in the west bank and gaza 
strip led to a substantial increase in human rights violations 
by israeli authorities last year 
it said the actions of israeli authorities resulted in many 
avoidable deaths among palestinians since they began their 
uprising 14 months ago since the december 1987 start of the 
uprising 374 palestinians have been killed and thousands wounded 
most by israeli army gunfire 
in jerusalem israel rejected key conclusions of the report and 
said it ignored the context of a violent civilian uprising by 
palestinians 
a foreign ministry statement disputed the reports claim that 
soldiers who opened fire unnecessarily on arabs were given lenient 
sentences and in some cases not punished at all 
in spite of the constant provocations the israel defense force 
scrupulously maintains moral norms and human rights and treats any 
exceptions with utmost severity a foreign ministry statement said 
discussing the soviet union the report cited gorbachevs 
policies of glasnost and perestroika aimed at encouraging public 
discussion of national problems and the restructuring of the 
stagnant government and economy with achieving a major impact 
on the communist system 
but it also pointed out that powerful and pervasive forces 
are at work to defeat gorbachevs reforms and that individual 
guarantees to protect the rights of the individual against unbridled 
state authority are still needed 
the report which was released tuesday said it is premature to 
contend that a fundamental shift in soviet policy has occurred 
but added that the changes in evidence in 1988 have profound 
implications as advocates of significant systemic reform appear to 
have gained strength 
the report said prisoners detained on religious or political 
grounds have been released and that plans for the amendment or 
repeal of statutes limiting activities in these areas have been 
announced 
in addition freedom the leave the soviet union temporarily has 
been expanded it said it cited increased emigration for armenians 
ethnic germans jews and pentecostals 
plans have been adopted for elections which though not 
completely free and open are no longer to be the farce they have 
been heretofore the report said 
as the most significant development the report noted that 
the abuse of psychiatry has been made a punishable offense and that 
mental hospitals have been far less likely to confine persons for 
political or religious reasons 
the recognition of the need for action to secure the rights of 
individuals and the fact that the defects of the existing system 
are now openly discussed offer a basis for cautious hope of a 
better day the report said 
the state department has been issuing the annual reports since 
the mid1970s this years survey covers conditions in 169 countries 
and territories 
the report pointed to severe human rights setbacks in iraq and 
the african countries of burundi and sudan 
in iraq chemical warfare was used against kurdish rebels 
killing or injuring thousands and forcing thousands more to flee the 
country it said overall the country has an abysmal human rights 
record the report said 
the report indicated that perhaps the single greatest 
rightsrelated tragedy in the world occurred in southern sudan where 
it said some reports estimated that between 100000 and 250000 
civilians died of starvation 
the deaths occurred after elements of the armed forces on each 
side in sudans civil war interfered with or failed to cooperate 
with food delivery efforts 
on the positive side the report said there were significant 
steps toward democracy and human rights protection in south korea 
taiwan and pakistan it also said that the october plebiscite in 
chile has raised hopes for a peaceful return to democracy there

the aids epidemic will extend well into the 
next century and to combat it america must conduct extensive sex 
surveys provide sex education in plain language and distribute 
condoms widely according to a study released today 
the study by the national research council says the nations war 
against acquired immune deficiency syndrome and the virus that 
causes it human immunodeficiency virus is handicapped by outdated 
data on the sex habits of americans and by poor studies on precisely 
how many people now carry the aids virus 
the study said public health authorities have a pressing 
national need for statistics gathered in a variety of surveys 
including aids blood tests from a wide segment of the population 
such as newborns and women seeking abortions and for welldesigned 
studies of homosexuals prostitutes and intravenous drug users some 
of the major risk groups for the disease 
america the study said faces a long difficult battle against 
the aids virus and that effort will continue even after a cure is 
found 
the struggle to retard the spread of hiv is likely to persist 
well into the next century the study said improved 
understanding and prevention of the behaviors that spread hivaids 
will be needed not only in the short run but in the decades 
that follow any medical breakthrough as well 
it also noted hiv is already substantially seeded in the us 
population the number of people who are now infected may surpass 1 
million and the virus is likely to continue to spread if not in 
epidemic form then in a persistent more stable endemic form 
lincoln e moses chairman of the committee that produced the 
report told a news conference that aids is likely to kill more 
than 50000 americans in the year 1991 placing it among the top 
causes of death for people under 40 
our committee believes that the public health threat posed by 
aids is so great that we must find ways to overcome social and 
cultural taboos that stand in the way of improved aids prevention 
and we must do so quickly he said 
the director of the aids study charles f turner said 
information about american sexual behavior is outdated and 
unreliable 
to cause people to change what they do requires an 
understanding about how people think about sex he said the 
historical understanding of sexual information in this country is 
severely lacking there is a great need for information on sexual 
behavior of all types because we now have virtually no data 
the 589page study includes scores of recommendations aimed at 
gathering information on how aids is spread as well as the use and 
effectiveness of behavior modification programs 
among the recommendations 
blood tests for aids among all babies born in the us and 
among women seeking abortions at clinics 
vigorous programs of research into american sexual habits 
including sex outside of marriage between people of the same 
gender with people of both genders with prostitutes and 
variations in sexual techniques among the various types of sexual 
partnerings it also said the sexual habits of people who inject 
drugs should be studied 
expanded programs to teach safe injection techniques to drug 
users needlesharing among drug users is thought to be a major way 
in which aids is spread 
that condoms be readily available to all sexually active 
persons and that a study be conducted to determine how effective 
condoms and spermicides are in lowering the risk of hiv infection 
that sex education on preventing aids be available in clear 
explicit language in the idiom of the target audience 
that treatment be available for all sexually transmitted 
diseases which are thought to speed the spread of aids 
that television networks provide more public service messages on 
methods of avoiding aids and that they accept condom advertisements 
aids is a disease that destroys the bodys immune system and its 
ability to fight infection patients usually die of infections or 
cancers 
the disease is usually spread through sexual contact but also 
through contact with blood blood products or from a pregnant woman 
to her child 
most of the victims in the us are homosexuals or intravenous 
drug users but the disease has been spread through heterosexual 
contact contaminated blood transfusions and from mother to newborn 
the national research council is an arm of the national academy 
of sciences a private nonprofit group that advises the government 
on scientific matters

californians grabbed their cameras to capture a rare snowfall 
from the beaches of malibu to the streets of palm springs today 
while a slight warming trend held out the promise of a return to a 
normal winter in much of the nation 
some los angeles suburbs closed schools after getting up to 2 
inches of snow but there was little opportunity for surfers to 
build snowmen in the sand 
every once in a while the wind blows some flakes down here on 
the beach said bill gould who works at a gas station in malibu 
snow snow snow and lots of snow said los angeles police 
officer bill vaughn who was in the san fernando valley 20 miles 
northwest of downtown los angeles everybodys rolling out their 
polaroids and taking pictures of it 
after more than a week of record cold in the lower 48 states 
warmer temperatures today gave fruit farmers and others something to 
cheer about 
the freezeathon is over the national weather service 
declared in san antonio texas 
it does seem to be a trend agreed meteorologist bob johns at 
the weather services severe storms forecast center in kansas city 
mo 
it looks like well continue to have cold temperatures but it 
doesnt look like itll be as extreme 
not that spring is just around the corner temperatures today in 
most places were only slightly higher than those tuesday when 
records were set in dozens of cities 
the recordbreaking cold continued in several cities including 
boise idaho with minus 10 degrees ely nev minus 22 and 
sacramento calif 23 degrees salt lake citys minus 7 tied its 
record for the date 
the bitter cold was expected to linger in colorado particularly 
where it was 35 below zero early today in the town of craig and 
more cold weather came calling from canada moving into the northern 
plains on tuesday and hitting the great lakes with strong wind and 
nearblizzard conditions 
its just terrible said dan luna a meteorologist for the 
national weather service in marquette mich we just now recorded 
a gust of wind up to 45 miles per hour 
at least 89 deaths have been attributed to the weather since jan 
31 when bitter arctic air from alaska made its way into the lower 
48 states in one such death tuesday an elderly woman who had more 
than 5000 stashed in her plywood shack in laredo texas died of 
hypothermia 
in idaho where as many as 1600 cattle and sheep have died in 
towering snow drifts national guardsmen in helicopters flew over 
the countryside to help ranchers search for surviving livestock few 
were found 
but in one indication of a thaw the temperature in fairbanks 
alaska climbed above zero tuesday for the first time in 26 days 
its been quite a while fairbanks meteorologist john lingaas 
said he predicted that the mercury which hit 8 above tuesday 
would be into the 20s by thursday 
low temperatures in much of california climbed back above 
freezing early today ending the crisis for the states 
multibilliondollar agriculture industry 
still farmers said the freeze has already caused serious damage 
to some citrus crops prompting increases in the wholesale price of 
oranges 
the lemon crop in the san joaquin valley may have been 
obliterated said richard pescosolido farm manager for sequoia 
orange co in exeter 
washington states 27 million apricot crop the nations second 
largest was badly damaged by the cold county extension agents 
said and the states winter wheat crop remains threatened but in 
texas rio grande valley citrus growers said damage to their crops 
was light 
we really came through very well said ray prewett executive 
director of texas citrus mutual a mcallenbased growers 
organization itll take a few days to make a final determination 
but it looks good 
still all was not balmy in texas houston today broke its 
alltime record of 110 consecutive hours of freezing temperatures a 
28degree reading pushed the record to 111 hours but the 
temperature rose above freezing an hour later to end the streak 
homeless people continued to flock to shelters in san francisco 
although they too were cheered by the prospect of slightly less 
chilling weather the citys temperature early today was 40 degrees 
im thrilled out of my mind that its going to be just a little 
less cold even though its not exactly going to warm up said 
jason derick 33 a homeless man who planned to spend the night in a 
cubicle at san franciscos civic center 
there were reports of homeless people being turned away from 
overflowing shelters in las vegas which on tuesday had its coldest 
february day ever with a low of 16 degrees ice formed in the 
fountains at caesars palace 
further north in reno more than 400 people crowded into 
shelters to escape record lows of 16 below zero we took in more 
people than we were supposed to said salvation army capt kenneth 
osbourn we cant turn anybody out in this kind of weather 
in new orleans officials said cold weather on fat tuesday held

working women earn only 65 percent of 
mens wages but are gaining ground according to a rand corp survey 
released today 
although the wage gap is rapidly narrowing an increasing 
percentage of the poor are women according to the study by 
economists james p smith and michael ward 
poverty was sex neutral in 1940 when more than 90 percent of 
all families included a husband and wife but by 1980 62 percent of 
poor adults were women the study said 
with the rising incidence of unwed parenting and divorce the 
fraction of femaleheaded families rose and did so at an accelerated 
rate after 1960 the authors said 
by 1980 women headed almost one in seven families almost 70 
percent more than in 1960 this problem reached epidemic proportions 
among blacks where now more than four out of every 10 families are 
headed by women 
the study found that between 1980 and 1986 wages for working 
women increased from 60 percent of mens wages to 65 percent they 
estimated that women would make at least 74 percent of mens wages 
by 2000 
the study which surveyed wages and skill levels in american 
women since 1920 was published in the february issue of the journal 
of economic perspective and was funded by the national institute of 
child health and human development 
the authors based their findings on figures from the equal 
employment opportunity commission the office of federal contract 
compliance program and us census forms

thinktank focusing on national security and domestic welfare

weather is a greater threat to the nations 
energy system than the possibility of terrorist attacks an industry 
official told a senate panel today 
utilities and the department of energy have initiated a security 
program to protect the nations electrical distribution system but 
skepticism was rampant among planners that a multisite 
terrorist attack ever would be carried out against us electric 
facilities said michael r gent president of the north american 
electric reliability council 
he told the senate governmental affairs committee that the 
dependability and resilience of the nations energy system has 
been amply demonstrated 
gent said hurricanes could cause more damage than terrorists 
and weve shown we can handle hurricanes 
another witness before the committee which was concluding two 
days of hearings on the vulnerability of us telecommunications and 
energy resources to terrorism said there had been 283 documented 
cases of sabotage against american energy systems since 1980 
but robert k mullen a terrorism expert said he saw no evidence 
of an increasing terrorist threat in the united states and that most 
previous acts of sabotage have been aimed at individuals who own or 
operate service stations or other retail facilities 
very little of what goes on with regard to energy sabotage in 
preindustrial nations is comparable to what occurs in the united 
states mullen said in reference to increased sabotage activities 
in other parts of the world 
there are no indicators of which i am awarethat would 
suggest to me the threat to energy assets here is substantially 
different from what the recent historical record indicates mullen 
said 
in testimony tuesday the committee was told that the increasing 
hightech nature of the us telecommunications systems and a trend 
towards centralization of facilities was making the networks more 
vulnerable to terrorist attack 
the government is illequipped to deal with such attacks which 
could be carried out with conventional weapons or even computers 
by as few as a halfdozen assailants a committee investigator said 
following a yearlong investigation 
in many cases the consequences appear to be manageable in a 
few cases the consequences are potentially catastrophic charles 
c lane a committee investigator told a committee hearing 
the associated press this week reported that the energy 
department was quietly advising us companies of a growing threat 
of terrorist attack on vital domestic energy facilities and that it 
was pressing them to fortify their defenses 
an internal doe report obtained by the ap said it was possible 
that potential third world adversaries could sponsor attacks on 
the energy infrastructure in the us 
it was learned that a special interagency task force has been 
created within the national security council to assess the 
vulnerability of us energy systems and to study ways of minimizing 
the risk of supply disruptions caused by technoterrorism 
lane said that while us energy and telecommunications systems 
are robust and often redundant they are vulnerable to multisite 
terrorist attacks and while the government is prepared to handle a 
major national security emergency there are no programs designed 
specifically to deal with a telecommunications disaster 
the committee hearings are being held to study how well the 
federal government and industry are organized to repel attacks and 
sustain and repair vital energy telecommunications and 
transportation sources 
john c mcdonald who chaired a national research council 
committee that investigated the vulnerability of the nations 
telecommunications system told the committee that because 
longdistance networks rely upon a very limited number of signal 
transfer points a few wellplaced hand grenades would crash major 
portions of the domestic longdistance networks 
but other witnesses were less alarmist about the effects of such 
attacks benham e morriss deputy manager of the governments 
national communications system said he was not complacent about 
the dangers but added i think the statements that have been made 
are vastly overstated 
morriss acknowledged that the consequences today of 
communications disruptions can be much greater than in the past 
but i dont think from a national security point of view weve 
gotten into a worse situation 
thomas a norman representing the recently created national 
security telecommunications advisory committee said the 
industrygovernment panel did not share the degree of concern of 
the other witnesses at the hearing 
norman said the trend to more diversity in the telecommunications 
industry is good for national security and that technology advances 
are making detection of troubles and restoration of our network 
even faster than in the old days 
but mcdonald said increasing dependence on new technology such as 
fiber optics and computer software and a trend towards 
centralization of facilities increases vulnerability 
he said his committee recommended action to make critical 
network facilities more secure reduce the concentration of 
network traffic and examine ways to provide more diversity in 
transmission facilities 
he said the government also should establish additional emergency 
plans using simulated disaster and recovery scenarios and should try 
to determine means of protecting public networks from penetration 
by hostile users 
mcdonald said the government has excellent contingency plans for 
disasters that cause massive loss of life but when it comes to 
the areas of economic disruption or social disruption we feel that 
more needs to be done 
committee chairman john glenn dohio said he didnt want the 
government to play big brother and saddle the industry with more 
rules 
but if we see vulnerabilities creeping in we cant afford to 
stay out of it if were looking at the national security 
glenn said 
lane said an effort is essential to identify and initiate 
measures to harden networks to withstand assaults and to make plans 
to recover services lost as a result of successful attack

mayor eugene sawyer promised to make the debate a 
hot time for frontrunner richard m daley but it was an 
underdog who tried to light a fire under a mayoral campaign that has 
been anything but sizzling 
liberal alderman larry bloom needled both his foes as they 
squabbled about sawyers campaign advertisements bloom a 
longshot also questioned their independence and said he was the 
only candidate who could unify the city 
people say white people are voting for daley becauses hes 
white black people are voting for sawyer because they think hes 
black said bloom who is white but represents a predominantly 
black ward 
they do not think im black larry sawyer retorted they 
know im black 
sawyers quick reply earned laughter and loud applause from the 
250 people in the audience at public television station wttw 
tuesday it was the first and only debate scheduled before the feb 
28 democratic primary 
polls show daley the cook county states attorney and son of the 
late mayor holding a commanding lead of 50 percent to 30 percent 
for sawyer and 10 percent for bloom with 10 percent undecided 
when a questioner said sawyers ads characterized richard daley 
as dumb and asked whether they were the acts of a desperate 
candidate the mayor denied the suggestion 
the characterization that you make is absolutely untrue i did 
not say that the commercials did not say that those 
commercials were designed to let people know that he has not been 
out in the communities that he has not taken the opportunity to 
discuss issues sawyer said 
daley said the ads are very sad to see i think people are sick 
and tired of this kind of personal attack all over the city 
bloom who carries a toy duck to appearances to dramatize his 
claim that daley is ducking chances to appear before the same 
crowds interjected with some humor 
well ive had lots of problems in this campaign ive had 
problems getting noticed by the press but there is one problem i 
havent had and that is how to spend money on commercials i dont 
have enough money to put them on 
bloom went on the offensive throughout the 90minute forum he 
suggested sawyer was beholden to a city council clique of 
antireform aldermen who elected him mayor after harold washingtons 
sudden death of a heart attack 15 months ago and daley was beholden 
to individuals and companies who have lined his war chest with 
contributions of up to 100000 
he also said daley lacked the managerial skills and the ability 
to heal racial wounds that the next mayor needs 
yes richie you could muddle through a term as mayor just as 
gene has muddled through the past year he said but thats not 
good enough 
observers generally agreed however that daley emerged without 
serious damage and would be able to maintain a conservative campaign 
strategy aimed at protecting his lead 
bloom was the clearcut winner said veteran political 
analyst tom roesser but he overdid it he didnt have to wrap 
the kitchen sink around him

the clarionledger jackson miss on the sampl crisis 
the bush administrations trial balloon to charge depositors fees 
to bail out the faltering savings and loan industry has been 
properly shot down 
however president bushs new idea might just fly the new plan 
calls for borrowing in the form of bonds to finance the bail out 
and repaying the bonds with increased insurance payments from banks 
and sampls 
although consumers will help pay eventually in such things as 
reduced interest rates requiring substantial industry payment is 
much fairer than a depositors tax 
the president also recommended changes in the federal supervision 
of the savings and loan industry and said he would recommend 
increased justice department investigation of alleged wrongdoing in 
faild thrifts 
the bush plan is as painless as could be expected and appears to 
have industry support

kennebec journal augusta maine on the sampl crisis 
there has been so much nonsense in recent days about the savings 
and loan crisis that it was good to hear a bit of sense somewhere on 
capitol hill 
the nations 350 insolvent sampls reports the general accounting 
office should be closed quickly these institutions must be 
isolated from the rest of the industry to prevent them from 
competing with healthy institutions said comptroller general 
charles bowsher 
bowsher is right on the money in the present deregulated market 
failing sampls are free to continue seeking deposits paying 
abovemarket rates on money which sooner or later will have to be 
repaid by the federal government its a classic case of throwing 
good money after bad 
the 350 failed sampls havent been closed already because theres 
no money to pay depositors congress and the outgoing reagan 
administration kept postponing the day of reckoning 
it has now arrived and one part of the solution closing all 
insolvent sampls is on the table it doesnt make coming up with the 
money any easier but shows that the longer we wait the more 
painful the bill

houston chronicle on president bushs trip to south korea 
president bush has scheduled a visit of several hours in seoul 
south korea later this month he is likely to get an earful 
government and business in south korea are worried about the 
effects of the new trade legislation that could punish the country 
for unfair trade practices 
there is some disappointment in korean circles over bushs choice 
of donald gregg a former cia officer who was bushs national 
security adviser as vice president as ambassador to seoul 
there will be efforts to dispel lingering doubts about the 
stability of the south korean government 
and there will be the noisy radical students who are 
antigovernment and antiamerican 
bush might well have postponed his visit until a later date 
one thing is certain he will have to be very careful about what he 
says during the seoul stopover

tulsa okla world on the sinosoviet summit 
there was a time when the very thought of renewed relations 
between china and the soviet union would have scared the daylights 
out of americans how times change 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev will soon visit china the 
first russian leader to do so since nikita khrushchev met mao 
tsetung in 1959 and most americans arent greatly concerned 
the limited renewal of relations between these two giants cannot 
be dismissed by american strategic planners of course 
but it may even produce some advantages for the free world it 
could shore up russian confidence in gorbachev and strengthen his 
hand in his reform efforts 
stable relations between china and russia once seen as a danger 
to the west will now be cautiously welcomed by most of the world 
stability is a highly prized commodity these days

the honolulu advertiser on the john tower nomination 
even if the charges about john towers drinking and womanizing 
turn out to be so much scurrilous unsupported gossip there must be 
others who are better qualified to be secretary of defense 
and if president bush defends tower strongly now that will be 
a tip that its time to watch more closely what the president does 
and not to just read his lips 
this simply isnt the time for a john towertype in that job

timesunion albany ny on the john tower nomination 
the president of the united states has traditionally and 
rightly been permitted to appoint his cabinet pretty much as he has 
seen fit the president after all has to appoint men and women 
whom he knows and with whom he can work closely 
in that sense john tower the defense secretarydesignate 
should be approved by the senate 
president bush has chosen for defense secretary a man whose 
job resume raises numerous questions about potential conflicts of 
interest 
since retiring from the senate where he served on a major 
defense committee tower has managed to become perhaps the 
premier defense lobbyist in the country last year he earned nearly 
threequarters of a million dollars from half a dozen of the 
nations largest defense contractors now he is about to become the 
most important defense department buyer 
there is nothing to suggest that tower is anything but 
upright and honest the issue is neither his character nor his 
competence but the high criteria bush has vowed to establish 
for public servants 
just what are those criteria and is there a tension between what 
the president says and what he does if so it should be ironed out

the indianapolis star on black history month 
the world of entertainment and the world of sports would be bleak 
indeed without their black american stars and superstars 
but below the spectacular highlands of fame and glory black 
families and individuals working in everyday jobs made their 
contributions to the building of america 
much that goes into the making of a nation is far from glamorous 
but even though it is obscure it is necessary it is part of the 
big picture it is elemental in the weave of life 
this is black history month which is dedicated to widening 
knowledge and deepening understanding of the role of blacks in 
american life

the new mexican santa fe nm on border ditch and fence 
proposals 
proposals to spend millions of dollars to build ditches and 
fences along the usmexico border are neither new nor wise 
last month the us immigration and naturalization service 
proposed a fourmile ditch near san diego to stop vehicles from 
crossing illegally along that section of the international border 
the price tag of the 14footwide 5footdeep ditch would be about 
2 million 
associate attorney general francs a keating ii compared it to a 
buried berlin wall mexico city newspapers called it the chile 
curtain 
next the federation for american immigration reform a private 
immigration reform group proposed that the government build 10 
miles of 12foot concrete bunkers topped with 8foot wire fences on 
the border at el paso texas that would cost millions more 
although no estimate was given 
it would be a waste of taxpayers money to turn these plans into 
concrete and posts and wire obstacles that are unlikely to reduce 
the flow of illegal immigrants or drug trafficking in any 
significant fashion 
they serve only to cause more hard feelings along the border and 
between the governments of the two countries

a jury resumed deliberations today in the case 
against a drifter accused of murdering and sexually mutilating three 
american indian women 
the jurors received the case tuesday after a prosecutor argued 
that billy glaze was still savoring the ghoulish slayings and a 
defense attorney charged that glaze had been victimized by publicity 
and vindictive witnesses 
glaze 45 is charged with murdering kathleen bullman 19 
angeline whitebirdsweet 27 and angela green 26 in 1986 and 1987 
in minneapolis if convicted he faces a mandatory sentence of life 
in prison minnesota has no death penalty 
prosecutor pete connors said in closing arguments that glaze who 
pretended to be an indian hated women and he particularly hated 
indian women 
he had a fury in his gut he wanted to hurt them and hurt them 
badly and he wanted to kill them and to have them die in anguish 
connors said he killed these women in an unbelievably ghoulish 
fashion and hes sitting in jail enjoying it 
defense attorney michael colich characterized glaze as a 
nonviolent drifter who called attention to himself by saying 
despicable things about women 
he said police were not thorough in their investigation of other 
suspects because of public pressure to solve the killings 
not one piece of evidence points to billy glaze but because he 
has a bad mouth and because he left town they think he did it 
colich said

an fbi agent told a senate investigative panel 
today that corruption is pervasive among indian tribes in the united 
states but often federal laws are inadequate to prosecute 
wrongdoers 
special agent richard james elroy said agents investigating 
bribery can often prove that money has changed hands between 
contractors and tribal leaders but are unable to demonstrate there 
was the kind of quid pro quo agreement that a prosecutor can use to 
show that money was in exchange for a favor 
he also said state officials would be treated differently than 
indian leaders are if corruption in their governments was suspected 
for some reason tribal governments are not included in the code 
for treatment like state governments would be he said 
elroy acknowledged that the bureau of indian affairs is 
responsible for oversight in indian reservation business but he 
said tribal leaders have had local bia directors removed by 
complaining to washington 
another fbi agent anthony daniels said there has been 
infiltration of legal indian gambling operations by organized crime 
most of the available examples of la cosa nostra influence in 
indian bingo games have been isolated daniels said and he does 
not view the problem as a substantial and consistent threat yet 
however he said any form of highstakes gambling seems to be 
a magnet to the lcn whenever or wherever there are situations 
which generate large volumes of cash the lcn will most assuredly 
attempt an approach 
he called for outside regulation of indian gaming operations by 
the federal government 
in tuesdays hearing secretly taped conversations were played 
indicating the chairman of the navajo nation devised a scheme to 
cover up thousands of dollars in kickbacks from the sale of a 
491000acre ranch to his tribe 
the voice of tribal chairman peter macdonald sr was heard in a 
recording made by real estate broker byron t bud brown in 
cooperation with a special investigative unit of the senate select 
committee on indian affairs 
brown who testified before the panel under a grant of immunity 
said he paid macdonald 25000 to pay a bank loan and gave him 
50000 in cash and an expensively equipped bmw automobile as his 
share of profits from the sale of the 491000acre big boquillas 
ranch in western arizona 
in the tape recording of a conversation nov 22 1988 macdonald 
tells brown to say that the 25000 and car were for his son peter 
macdonald jr 
they discuss point by point what brown should tell investigators 
its rocky that asked you for this 25000 the senior 
macdonald says in reference to his son nicknamed rocky and later 
the older macdonald is heard saying that his son wanted the car 
since he doesnt have a vehicle 
the senior macdonald wanted to cover up the payments after the 
local us attorney began an investigation of the sale brown told 
the committee 
the sale raised questions because of a 72 million profit made 
by the men who brokered it brown had arranged for businessman tom 
tracy to buy the ranch from tenneco west inc for 262 million 
then immediately sell it to the navajos for 33 million under the 
deal tracy and brown shared the profit with brown then paying 
macdonald 
i felt and still feel that the ranch at 68 an acre is a good 
value brown said noting that the navajos most recently have paid 
100 or more per acre for property 
what bothers me is that what i did with chairman macdonald was 
improper he said 
besides giving macdonald 25000 and a car brown said he paid 
the tribal chairman several 5000 increments in 100 bills 
the payments were arranged by macdonalds son who called brown 
when his father needed money and used the word golf balls as a 
code for money 
in another taped conversation played for the committee brown is 
heard talking to the junior macdonald on dec 14 1988 
were all three of us three musketeers shoulder to shoulder 
macdonald says in reference to browns question as to whether he 
would stick by the story with his father and brown 
on monday the junior macdonald who is an attorney told the 
committee under immunity that he went along with the scheme 
because i love my father 
representatives of a navajo task force appeared at the committee 
hearing and distributed a statement in which they demanded to be 
heard by the committee 
various individuals have implicated and leveled charges against 
the navajo nation without substantiating their allegations with 
facts the group said 
such malicious allegations are attempts to discredit the 
integrity of the navajo nation its people government and 
sovereignty 
while corruption may exist in any government or at any level 
within the navajo nation as it may in washington dc the 
committees nearly exclusive focus on selected abuses is creating 
the public impression that corruption at navajo is universal the 
statement said 
sen dennis deconcini dariz who chairs the special 
investigative unit said arrangements to have members of the navajo 
task force testify in the latter part of the month would be made

president bush will put an additional 250 
million or so for education programs into the budget proposal he 
submits to congress on thursday as a downpayment on his pledge to 
be the education president congressional and administration 
sources said today 
the money will go for a broadening of the head start program and 
perhaps a few other initiatives bush promised to pursue during his 
presidential campaign last year said the sources who spoke only on 
condition of anonymity 
but much of bushs emphasis on education at least for the 1990 
fiscal year will be rhetorical rather than financial the sources 
conceded the money just isnt there said one republican 
congressional leadership aide much of what he wants to do will 
not involve federal funds 
bush has been revealing his budget in bits and pieces in advance 
of its release as he tries to emphasize those parts likely to 
engender a warm reception on capitol hill 
i am under no illusions that we are going to keep everybody 
happy he said while asking gop senators for a sympathetic hearing 
in his speech to congress on thursday night he repeated the message 
in a series of stops in the capitol on tuesday but specifically 
mentioned those things the lawmakers wanted to hear no tax 
increase and more money for the environment education and 
fighting drugs 
it will make i think a strong beginning in some of the areas 
that a lot of us talked about in the past campaign he said 
but the bush plan necessarily will include many less popular 
items many left over from the fiscal 1990 spending plan drafted by 
president reagan such as a 5 billion reduction in the medicare 
health plan for the elderly and bush has decided to include some 
controversial items of his own as he struggles to balance his notax 
pledge and other campaign promises 
statements by bush himself and conversations with administration 
and congressional officials reveal the list of his proposals will 
include 
a cut in the tax rate on capital gains as promised by bush in 
the campaign the administration will claim the lower tax rate 
actually boosts government revenues an extremely controversial 
stand especially among democrats who oppose the cut as favoring the 
wealthy 
the rate now 28 percent would be reduced more for longer 
investments in order to emphasize business investment rather than 
fastbuck transactions 
holding the military budget to only an inflationary increase in 
the fiscal year beginning oct 1 and then only slightly more than 
inflation in the next two years conservatives are sure to oppose 
this sharp retreat from the reagan military buildup 
reagan had proposed increasing military spending authority to 
3152 billion next year and bushs stance would cut that 6 
billion actual cash outlays money spent during 1990 would be 
reduced 2 billion 
a childcare tax credit instead of the more direct federal 
childcare system favored by many in the democratic congress the 
tax credit could eventually cost the treasury about 2 billion a 
year at much smaller cost bush will call for an expanded tax 
benefit for adoption 
bush on tuesday declared his budget pretty well finalized 
talking to reporters at a final budget session with budget director 
richard darman treasury secretary nicholas brady economic adviser 
michael boskin and vice president dan quayle 
his initiatives plus his savingsandloan bailout plan which 
will cost taxpayers an estimated 19 billion next year will be 
included in a 125page proposal to congress thursday the proposals 
in the document will be layered upon the 115 trillion budget that 
reagan submitted 
although bush is changing its emphasis somewhat he relies on the 
reagan program to reduce the deficit below the 100 billion maximum 
required by the grammrudman law 
reagans economic and technical estimates considered by many in 
congress and the private sector as too optimistic are largely 
embraced bush also goes along with reagans call for eliminating 
many domestic programs and cutting many others including farm 
subsidies and eliminating costofliving increases next year for 
federal retirees his plan also would sell off many of the assets 
reagan had sought to sell and raise many fees for government 
services 
although bush rejects reagans proposal to cut the medicaid 
program for the poor and plans to increase those benefits modestly 
through administrative costcutting he plans to include his 
predecessors 5 billion cut in the medicare programs expected 
spending

minnesotas education commissioner is 
urging schools to drop indian nicknames but an indian leader says 
thats not necessarily a good idea 
if your school district has an indian mascot emblem or symbol 
please report your progress toward removing them commissioner 
ruth randall and state board of education president marjorie johnson 
said in a letter this week 
they called the names offensive to persons of american indian 
culture and reminded districts of a board resolution adopted last 
year encouraging removal of indian mascots 
but chip wadena president of the minnesota chippewa tribe and 
the white earth indian reservation criticized the board for not 
consulting tribal officials 
wadena and other indian leaders said tuesday that they want the 
right to keep such mascots when the schools students are 
predominantly american indian they also said that indian themes are 
not a problem if handled with respect 
wadena said the white earth tribal council is supporting the 
mahnomen school district which is within the reservation in 
retaining its indians nickname about 38 percent of mahnomen 
high school students are indian 
but phil st john a member of concerned american indian parents 
who has led a campaign against using indian names as mascots said 
such names are derogatory and portray indians in an animalistic 
warlike image 
last month the minnesota civil liberties union threatened to sue 
50 public schools for civil rights violations if they dont change 
their indian mascots

chinas population may reach 13 billion by the 
end of the century 100 million more than the target because of 
failures in carrying out the nations strict family planning 
policies 
the official china daily on wednesday quoted population experts 
as blaming administrators for not holding down population growth 
the experts discounted government arguments the recent surge in the 
growth rate was due to a baby boom 
china the worlds most populous nation has about 109 billion 
people 
yu jingyuan senior engineer of the beijing institute of 
information and control was quoted as saying the target of 12 
billion people by the year 2000 could have been met if the 
government had adhered to its onechild policy 
yu said stricter controls must be placed on rural families 
the 1980 policy of limiting each couple to one child generally 
has been successful in crowded urban areas but has met strong 
resistance in the countryside where couples want more children 
particularly sons to help in the fields and care for them when they 
become old 
newly affluent farmers are often willing to pay large fines for 
having two or three children many rural areas have relaxed the 
onechild policy to allow couples whose first child is a girl try 
for a boy 
the nationwide growth rate climbed from 11 per thousand in 1985 
to 141 in 1986 and 162 last year family planning officials have 
said the main cause of the climbing growth rate is that a baby boom 
generation from the early 1960s has reached childbearing age

senate majority leader george mitchell 
speaking on the eve of president bushs budget address to congress 
said wednesday it was time for bush to deliver deeds to match 
words and promised bipartisan cooperation with the white house 
mitchell in a speech to a united auto workers conference 
rattled off a list of bush campaign proposals on issues including 
the environment education and child care and said he would be 
listening closely when the president addresses a joint session 
we look forward to his proposals beginning thursday night 
as to how we should give meaning to those words the maine 
democrat said these policies like all others must begin with 
words but they cannot end with words 
there must be deeds to match words action to fulfill 
intention mitchell continued were going to hold the president 
accountable to his words and we want to work with him working 
together we can do much 
mitchell also promised passage of legislation to increase the 
minimum wage one of his top legislative priorities as well as 
labors 
if i dont do anything else as majority leader of the united 
states senate im going to see that the minimum wage is increased 
this year as it should be he said to a standing ovation 
the minimum wage which has been 335 an hour since 1981 would 
increase 40 cents an hour to 455 at the end of three years under 
senate legislation supported by mitchell after that the 
legislation calls for the minimum wage to be indexed annually to 50 
percent of the average hourly income of us workers 
mitchell delivered a lengthy defense of the democratic party 
traditionally backed by organized labor and said bushs call for a 
kinder gentler america included ideas for which we have 
worked as democrats for a half century 
but in an unusual statement nonetheless met with applause 
mitchell said many of those those who have benefitted from 
democratsponsored programs including union members have abandoned 
the party 
theres a lot of analysis about why democratic candidates have 
lost five out of the last six presidential elections mitchell 
said and as a member of the democratic leadership i say we in the 
party share a major portion of the responsibility but i also say to 
you that there are a lot too many of your members who have 
forgotten where they came from who because of democrats began to 
live like republicans and then started voting that way

two former top executives of regina co 
pleaded guilty today to defrauding investors in the vacuum cleaner 
company of more than 100 million by issuing inflated earnings 
reports 
former regina chairman donald d sheelen 42 and former chief 
financial officer vincent p golden 48 admitted misleading 
stockholders and the securities and exchange commission in 1987 and 
1988 
us attorney samuel a alito jr said sheelen instructed golden 
to falsify sales by not subtracting returned appliances from company 
income regina had problems with the quality of its housekeeper 
vacuum cleaners analysts said 
this is a case representing massive misrepresentation by the 
company alito said at a news conference it represents losses 
well in excess of 100 million by the investing public 
the two men pleaded guilty to mail and security fraud and could 
receive up to five years in prison and 250000 in fines at 
sentencing april 14 alito said restitution may also be sought the

several members of the senate armed services 
committee received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions 
from the same defense contracting firms that hired defense 
secretarydesignate john tower to lobby for them records show 
tower a former republican senator from texas who headed the 
armed services panel until his retirement in 1984 has said he 
received over 1 million in a threeyear period from firms including 
rockwell international martin marietta corp ltv aerospace and 
defense co and textron corp 
members of the panel which has put off a vote on towers 
nomination have raised questions about whether tower could remain 
impartial at the pentagon because of his ties to defense contractors 
sen sam nunn dga the committee chairman said wednesday that 
the most recent delay in the confirmation process stemmed from the 
fbis investigation into new allegations of a financial nature 
involving the nominee

1987 and 1988 the political action committees of at least four 
defense firms that hired tower also contributed to panel members 
altogether the pacs gave to more than 100 presidential 
senatorial and congressional candidates federal election law 
prohibits companies from giving directly to campaigns but pacs may 
contribute up to 10000 per election cycle to a candidate

an experimental brain operation has produced 
moderate improvement for some victims of parkinsons disease but 
surgeons have failed to match dramatic results reported by a mexican 
doctor a researcher said 
all the patients in our group have said they felt it was 
worthwhile but in no case has it achieved what they hoped it 
would said dr christopher g goetz of rushpresbyterianst 
lukes medical center in chicago 
the operation involves removing tissue from patients adrenal 
glands and transplanting it in their brains the goal is to provide 
the victims brains with a source of dopamine an essential 
messagecarrying chemical that they lack 
the operation was first reported two years ago by dr ignacio 
madrazo and colleagues at the national autonomous university of 
mexico and the social security hospital system in mexico city they 
reported dramatic improvement in two patients and since then 
surgeons at many medical centers have tried to duplicate their 
results 
what came out originally was the sense that this was a 
miracle goetz said this is no miracle 
his report combined the results of surgery on 19 patients at his 
hospital and at the university of south florida and the university 
of kansas the results were published in thursdays new england 
journal of medicine 
parkinsons disease results from destruction of a part of the 
brain called the nigral tissue which makes dopamine the adrenal 
glands which lie above the kidneys also produce this substance 
between 500000 and 1 million americans including 2 percent of 
everyone over 70 have parkinsons they often suffer tremors and 
have trouble controlling their movements 
drugs can control the disease but as the illness worsens the 
medicines lose their effectiveness and often dont work for hours at 
a time 
before the surgery the patients drugs worked about half the 
time afterward this increased to threequarters of the time 
while the drugs are working the patients are able to move about 
and care for themselves with little assistance although they still 
clearly show the effects of the disease when the drugs are not 
effective they are confined to wheelchairs 
despite cautious optimism we conclude that the widespread use 
of this procedure outside of research centers is premature the 
researchers wrote

c ronald hovell 400 miles away from the 
debate on the size of his paycheck considered time his greatest 
enemy marylouise uhlig here in the middle of it all dropped ralph 
nader from her list of heroes 
both were on the verge of getting big pay increases but saw their 
hopes dashed a house plan to let the controversial federal pay 
raises become law collapsed and the pay package was scuttled just 
hours before it was to take effect 
i was just hoping the clock would tick faster than it did 
said hovell a civilian deputy chief of staff for the air force 
logistics command in dayton ohio ive got to admit that im down 
emotionally more than i was the first time 
the first time was four years ago the last time a presidential 
commission recommended big pay hikes for congress federal judges 
and senior government executives congress rejected those too in 
the face of public outcry 
this time was tuesday when the house caved in to mounting 
pressure and passed a resolution rejecting the raises scheduled to 
take effect at 1201 am wednesday the senate quickly followed 
suit and the measure was signed by president bush 
the mood is very very bleak said uhlig an environmental 
protection agency official like hovell and 7112 others at the top 
levels of career civil service she was due to receive a pay 
increase under the plan 
a majority of the executives live and work in the washington 
area where the pay plan has been the talk of the town now there is 
talk of leaving 
i was very optimistic until two days ago uhlig said 
somehow it got off track its very demoralizing very 
discouraging there is really going to be a great exodus of people 
turnover among the executives averages 10 percent a year and is 
double that among recipients of the presidential distinguished rank 
award a bonus program for the governments top managers 
hovell is among the winners of the award his work includes 
helping draft the air forces fiveyear budget plan and affects more 
than 100000 people 
if i were eligible i would leave said hovell a 32year 
government employee who wont reach pension eligibility for another 
five years when he turns 55 and if i were on the outside id 
think twice about a government career 
carol bonosaro suggests talented managers or college graduates 
wont even think once about government service now 
the american taxpayer might like taking pot shots at congress 
but the net result is that the taxpayer is going to be the loser 
said bonosaro president of the senior executive association an 
organization representing the senior managers we are not going to 
be able to keep career executives in government and were going to 
see a lower quality of people serving in these jobs and the programs 
will suffer 
members of the governments senior executive service received a 
41 percent costofliving raise in january and now make from 
68700 to 80700 the scale would have been from 80000 to 
120000 under the plan killed tuesday costing the government 112 
million for the rest of this fiscal year and all of next year 
the reaction has been a lot of talk about filling out the 
retirement papers bonosaro said how can you go home and look 
at your family and say youre staying again at a salary half what 
they can earn in the private sector 
uhlig 21 years a government employee said were going to 
have a crisis in the public service and she blames nader the 
consumer advocate she says she once admired 
he was a hero of mine uhlig said of the man who helped lead 
opposition to the pay raises 
there was talk that bush would propose legislation to give 
federal judges and the executives raises 
but hovell wasnt expecting good news from washington 
i dont have any hope that it will happen he said im 
glad i didnt go to the point where i was really spending the 
money

the justice department interrupted oliver 
norths irancontra trial today urging new safeguards to prevent 
the former white house aide from making surprise disclosures of 
classified information 
north has made no effort to assist the court in dealing 
responsibility with classified information the department said in 
a court filing that it made on behalf of us intelligence agencies 
in the filing by assistant attorney general edward sg dennis 
the justice department asked us district judge gerhard a gesell 
to prohibit north from disclosing any classified information except 
with explicit court rulings that it is admissible and when the 
united states has no pending objection at the time the disclosure is 
made 
gesell immediately postponed the jury selection process until 
thursday and scheduled an afternoon hearing to discuss whether the 
department of justice has any business being here the trial began 
jan 31 and opening arguments had been imminent 
independent counsel lawrence walsh whose office is prosecuting 
north protested the departments intervention and made a proposal 
of his own in an attempt to overcome the agencys interference he 
proposed alternative proposals to protect classified information 
seeking an order to enable the court to proceed to trial without 
delay 
the justice department noting that walsh had sought a less 
extensive protective order than the one sought by the government 
said the attorney general not the independent counsel was the 
final arbiter of classified information issues 
whether or not the department of justice has any business being 
here has to be talked about gesell said im just a way station 
on an elevator ride upstairs he said he wanted to hear arguments 
on the right of the department of justice to participate against 
the independent counsel 
charging that north has provided totally useless or at best 
minimally informative notices of the documents he wants to 
disclose the department urged gesell to institute greater 
protections to prevent unwarranted disclosures 
a department source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
that if gesell ruled against the government it would appeal such an 
appeal could delay the trial 
the department said gesell has issued only general guidance 
on the relevance and admissability of secret information so the 
parties are left to their own devices to determine in opening 
statements direct examination and crossexamination as to what 
classified information to mention 
without specific orders the department said there is every 
reason to believe that irrelevent or immaterial classified 
information might be revealed during trial 
the department urged gesell to follow the procedures of the 
classified information procedures act known as cipa they provide 
for closed hearings on the admissibility and relevance of classified 
evidence and for the attorney general to object to disclosure on the 
ground it would damage national security 
the court can seek to resolve admissibility issues before any 
evidence is offered or it can postpone some decisions but that 
whatever the decision it must afford the government and the 
attorney general the protections of cipa the departments filing 
said 
norths obstinate refusal to participate meaningfully in cipa 
proceedings cannot undermine the right of the united states and the 
responsibility of the attorney general to protect classified 
information while assuring that cases that can be tried will be 
tried it said 
at the present time the procedures adopted by the court in the 
instant case fail to implement the most important features of 
cipa the document added 
the government would be given an opportunity to register its 
objections at closed hearings to the disclosure of any classified 
evidence the justice department said 
the filing said north a former white house national security 
aide would not need specific permission to rely on prosecution and 
defense exhibits already edited for sensitive references by an 
interagency security group 
we are prepared to work with the court to make cipa effective 
in this case the department said it is a complex case in terms 
of classified information but we believe it is not so complex that 
it cannot go forward 
but in the face of the defendants intransigence we believe it 
is important that the government have the cipa protections available 
in their fullest the department said 
walsh countered with a proposal of his own seeking an order 
enabling the court to proceed to trial without delay 
the independent counsel said he wants an order stating that the 
rules limiting disclosure for classified information apply to 
norths opening statement crossexamination and other aspects of 
the defense case 
walsh also asked for an order stating that the defense make no 
mention of certain unspecified topics in its opening statement or at 
any point in the trial without first obtaining court approval 
in addition walsh said the government will advise the defense 
in advance of a witness testimony of any classified information 
that seems especially pertinent to the witness 
the government will endeavor to keep identification of 
classified information narrow specific and reasonable he said 
north faces 12 criminal charges he is accused of allegedly 
concealing from congress in 1985 and 1986 his efforts on behalf of 
the nicaraguan contras and of covering up from the attorney general 
the national security councils role in diverting money from the 
iran arms sales to the contras 
north also is accused of illegally accepting a 13800 security 
system at his home from codefendant richard secord converting to 
his own use at least 4300 in travelers checks from contra leader 
adolfo calero and conspiring to defraud the treasury of tax revenue 
in connection with charitable contributions supporting the contras 
due to national security concerns the two central charges in the 
case against north were dismissed jan 13 
those were the conspiracy and theft counts which accuse north of 
illegally diverting more than 14 million in us iran arms sale 
proceeds to the nicaraguan rebels

a federal judge has ruled that copyright 
protection extends to the computer instructions embedded in 
microchips 
us district judge william gray also ruled in the same case that 
a japanese manufacturer legally copied microchip designs from a us 
company 
the precedentsetting split decision filed tuesday could affect 
some of the most closely guarded secrets of us hightechnology 
companies observers said 
everyone won and everyone lost said alice leeper an analyst 
at dataquest inc 
the ruling in the 7year legal battle cleared nec ltd of 
allegations it illegally copied intel corps 8086 and 8088 line of 
computer chips the chips are the key to ibm personal computer 
systems 
gray said the silicon valley corporations failure to ensure that 
a copyright mark was included on each chip made by several of its 
licensee companies meant it had forfeited its copyright on the chips 
but gray also upheld intels contention that copyright protection 
extends to software called microcodes embedded in microprocessor 
chips although chip technology was already protected under 
copyright law that did not extend to hidden software such as the 
microcodes 
intel lawyer f thomas dunlap called the ruling a broad 
landmark decision for the industry 
we now have a precedent that our large investments in new 
products can be protected under copyright law he said 
robert morrill an attorney for nec said this is going to be 
a significant case in computer copyright law and sets a nice 
balance between whats protectable and whats not 
the two electronics giants which had once been partners began 
battling in 1982 
nec the worlds largest manufacturer of semiconductors had 
revenue of 218 billion in 1988 intel the no 3 producer of 
microchips in the united states reported revenue of 29 billion

objections from listeners in heavily catholic 
boston prompted a radio station to pull a commercial for frozen 
seafood dinners featuring an actress playing a roman catholic nun 
confessing to a priest 
on a personal level i felt it was a very creative 
commercial said tyler cox program manager at wbzam which 
pulled the ad last week after several plays 
cox said a moderate number of listeners called the station 
which has a primary audience ages 40 to 50 and were quite vocal in 
insisting the commercial be taken off the air 
theres a very large catholic base in boston which makes up a 
sizable percentage of our listening audience cox said 
the 30second spot for booth seafood products frozen entrees is 
titled confession and debuted nationally jan 23 it has aired 
on 11 boston radio stations 
we did not definitely try to single out catholics or in any 
way demean the catholic religion said michael yurchesyn 
marketing manager for national sea products inc and its booth 
subsidiary 
we got one or two complaints from denver and kansas city he 
said but i think we got more complaints in the boston area than 
anywhere else 
in part of the commercial sister catherine confesses to 
father callahan that she has gone back to eating fish on 
friday 
we stopped that in the 60s father callahan says 
but booth frozen seafood is so good 
do you find frozen seafood tempting sister 
yurchesyn and paul klein of north castle partners the stamford 
conn agency that created the commercial said preliminary market 
research predicted possible backlash 
but klein said since it helps focus attention on the ad the

the federal national mortgage association and 
the organization of local housing officials announced a pilot 
program wednesday selling foreclosed homes to local agencies for use 
by low and moderateincome families 
the first sales will be in four texas cities and in denver 
officials said they hope to expand the program throughout the 
country 
the federally chartered mortgage corporation known as fannie mae 
agreed to make all its inventory of foreclosed homes in those cities 
available for purchase by local housing or community development 
agencies 
the homes will be sold at a discount of 10 percent to 15 percent 
from market value said patrick oneill fannie mae senior vice 
president for real estate sales 
the discount reflects the savings to fannie mae in reduced 
holding costs and the absence of real estate brokerage commissions 
and other fees it must pay to sell the houses on the open market he 
said 
the program was announced jointly by the fannie mae a private 
corporation chartered by congress to provide financial services for 
housing and the national association of housing and redevelopment 
officials representing more than 2500 local housing and 
development agencies 
richard nelson executive director of the housing officials 
group said local agencies would use money available from bonds 
local appropriations or federal grants to purchase the homes where 
practical the homes will be rented or sold to low and 
moderateincome families 
fannie mae the nations largest investor in home mortgages has 
an inventory of 8000 foreclosed homes nationally and acquires them 
at a rate of about 900 a month it sold 17000 in 1988 
the first sales will be in austin dallas houston and san 
antonio texas as well as denver

a man awaiting a heart transplant has been 
supported a record 75 days on a stationary device that assists the 
hearts main pumping chamber raising hopes for development of a 
portable version a hospital said today 
texas heart institute researchers announced that the facility 
will be the site of the first human use of a portable 
batteryoperated heart assist device 
like the artificial heart it is designed to keep patients alive 
until they can receive transplants it does not appear to cause 
clots that lead to strokes a problem often associated with the 
artificial heart researchers said 
with food and drug administration approval the first tests of 
the new device will begin early next year hospital officials said 
the patient louis e wilson 39 of winnfield la has been on 
the heart assist device for nearly twice the previous world record 
wilson came to the institute nov 21 after he began to suffer 
liver and kidney failure because of ischemic cardimyopathy a 
degenerative condition in which his heart cannot pump enough blood 
on nov 25 a team led by dr oh frazier implanted the heart 
assist pump into wilsons abdomen the airpowered device has taken 
over the pumping activity required to circulate the blood through 
the 6foot 210pound mans body 
the pump 6 inches long and 2 inches wide is connected by tubes 
that come out of the stomach and are hooked to a machine run by 
electricity forcing the patient to remain in the hospital while he 
is using the device 
wilsons size and his type b blood have severely limited the 
number of appropriate donor hearts causing him to remain longer on 
the pump than any previous patient institute spokeswoman joyce 
staton said today 
texas heart institute which has used the pump 10 times held the 
previous world record of 41 days she said washington hospital 
center in washington dc and englands london hospital also have 
implanted the device 
a similar device the novocor has been used to support a patient 
at houstons methodist hospital for 100 days said spokeswoman 
brenda koch 
she did not know if that was a record for that device which also 
pumps blood but has some technical differences from the one used at 
the texas heart institute

the nuclear regulatory commission on wednesday 
moved toward adoption of a regulation that would require random drug 
and alcohol testing of employees at all us nuclear power plants 
the commission heard a briefing by the nrc staff on the proposed 
rule which would apply to all utilities operating or building 
atomic power stations 
brian grimes an nrc official said it was expected that the 
commission will have a final vote on the regulation within about a 
month after that he said official publication of the rule would 
take another month followed by a sixmonth implementation period 
about a third of the utilities now conduct some random testing 
said grimes director of reactor inspection and safeguards 
the new regulation would establish random testing for all 
utilities and at a fairly substantial rate perhaps at a rate of 
100 percent per year he said in an interview 
if the 100 percent testing rate is implemented it would require 
1000 random tests per year for every 1000 employees because the 
testing is random and the same employee may be tested more than once 
per year this rate would ensure that about twothirds of all 
employees are tested every year 
the deterrent effect is thought to come from the possibility 
that any day any individual may be subject to a test even though 
he may have just had one the week before grimes said 
asked to assess the seriousness of drug and alcohol abuse at 
nuclear power plants he said weve seen increasing evidence over 
the past few years that we are getting positive tests and it is 
involving reactor operators 
i think last year we had over the nation perhaps eight to 10 
cases where licensed operators had indications of positive drug 
tests not of impairment on the job but some relation to drugs 
so we think it is a problem it is not a widespread problem 
but i think were not invulnerable to societal problems in this 
industry as with any other industry grimes said 
during the briefing officials told the commission that the staff 
was proposing that the nrc regulation use threshold levels for 
marijuana cocaine and other drugs that have been determined by the 
department of health and human services 
for alcohol the staff proposed using the same impairment level 
004 percent blood alcohol content set by the department of 
transportation for testing programs involving transportation workers

intraveneous drug users in an effort to combat the spread of aids 
the program was adopted tuesday at the urging of dr john 
blatherwick the citys medical health officer and calls for 
distributing 10000 needles a month health officials have cited the 
reuse of needles by drug abusers as a leading cause of the spread 
of aids among heterosexuals 
to get a clean needle a drug user must bring a used one to the 
storefront office of the downtown eastside youth activities society 
which has been distributing about 3000 needles a month with funding 
from donations 
the program is similar to one adopted recently in tacoma wash 
which also began with a private needle exchange a private group 
distributes needles in new haven conn new york city new jersey 
and boston and another group is trying to start a program to 
distribute free needles in portland ore 
alderman don bellamy who voted against the proposal said 
vancouver should stay out of the drug equipment supply business 
despite the need to reduce the spread of acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome authorities should try to control drug problems rather 
than seeming to condone drug abuse by distributing free needles he 
said

an independent legislator has 
published a book detailing charges of widespread police abuses 
saying most whites are unaware of government crackdowns against 
black activists 
jan van eck considered the most leftwing member of the white 
chamber of parliament cites repeated cases of alleged police 
attacks on unarmed blacks in his book eyewitness to unrest 
van eck visited black townships near his cape town constituency 
almost daily during the height of black unrest in 198586 and based 
his book largely on those visits 
emergency regulations prohibit unauthorized reports about unrest 
and police actions although enforcement has not been comprehensive 
local and foreign reporters have written regularly about the 
disturbances which have calmed considerably in the past two years 
however television footage of unrest that has appeared overseas has 
not been shown on south africas state television network 
in south africa white people generally speaking are totally 
uninformed about what is happening in black areas van eck said 
in a recent interview after his book began appearing at stores 
they do not know how blacks have been beaten teargassed and 
tortured 
in his book van eck cites an aug 10 1985 incident in which 
police used sjamboks or whips to break up a crowd attempting to 
attend the funeral of a slain black activist 
the sight of 50 sjambokwielding policemen charging at 500 
defenseless men women and children and beating people left right 
and center froze me into semiparalysis van eck wrote a more 
peaceful crowd of 500 would have been difficult to find 
he also was present may 18 1986 when black vigilantes attacked 
homes of black antiapartheid activists in a cape town township 
there were virtually unanimous eyewitness accounts that the 
security forces had not interfered when the vigilantes started their 
attack van eck wrote witness upon witness reported that 
security forces actively helped burn down shacks 
at every attempt by the township residents to move toward 
their homes being torched by the vigilantes the police would use 
tear gas or buckshot to disperse them i saw it myself he wrote 
van eck frequently raises controversial issues not discussed in 
the mainstream of white political debate 
he acknowledges much of his book violates emergency regulations 
but said he made no attempt to abide by them because the emergency 
regulations are trying to prevent the truth from being told from 
people knowing the excessive amount of violence that is being used 
by the state 
van eck accuses law and order minister adriaan vlok of lying when 
confronted with allegations of police misconduct 
once you have reached a situation in which a minister 
repeatedly lies to parliament you have to start questioning the 
whole system and whether you arent in an early stage of anarchy 
van eck said 
local newspapers have reported the publication of the book but 
theres been no public response from the government when asked for 
comment law and order ministry spokesman lt pf botma said the 
ministry was aware of the book but had no comment about it 
if the government bans his book van eck said he will read it 
aloud in parliament where members are immune from prosecution for 
statements made during official sessions 
but van eck said he believed the government will probably try 
and ignore it and hope it will not be read by too many people

north korean demands that south korea 
halt joint military maneuvers with the united states blocked 
agreement wednesday on holding further highlevel talks 
the communist government also said it will postpone talks 
scheduled friday between legislators of the two koreas until the 
military exercise ends 
teams led by vice ministers agreed to only one thing wednesday 
to meet again march 2 in this panmunjom truce village to try again 
to negotiate the meeting of their prime ministers those talks would 
be the highest level held between the rivals and are aimed at ending 
44 years of confrontation since the peninsula was divided 
wednesdays meeting bogged down when the communists demanded an 
immediate halt to annual joint military exercises north korea 
claimed are an obstacle to dialogue 
testy debate over the team spirit maneuvers clouded attempts 
to discuss procedural matters or an agenda 
official pyongyang radio monitored in tokyo said the 
disagreements jeopardize future talks and announced north korea 
will postpone a friday meeting of legislators from both sides until 
the exercises end 
in seoul officials acknowledged hearing the broadcast but said 
they have not received official notice postponing fridays talks 
nor did they know whether the march 2 meeting will be affected 
chief north korean delegate paik nam jun demanded soon after the 
meeting opened that the joint exercise be stopped immediately and 
unconditionally charging they were war preparations 
south koreas chief delegate song hanho countered the 
exercises are defensive and intended to prevent a possible 
invasion north korea invaded south korea in 1950 starting a 
threeyear war 
song appealed to delegates to settle their differences 
in the past 40odd years we have wasted national potentials as 
we waged a war and persisted in confrontation and frictions despite 
our being the same brethren he said 
there was a similar appeal from south korean opposition leader 
kim daejung who said in rome that he is carefully optimistic 
about the talks 
both sides need to be more flexible urged the leader of the 
party for peace and democracy he said he is cultivating political 
and economic contacts in italy 
after wednesdays meeting paik and song accused each other of 
insincerity at separate news conferences 
song said he believed pyongyang is trying to make its call for an 
end to the joint maneuvers a precondition for the prime ministerial 
meeting 
paik said the south korean side did not show sincerity at 
todays meeting we hope they will come to the next meeting with a 
sure answer 
this years military exercises reportedly began last week 
athough there has been no official confirmation about 200000 us 
and south korean troops took part in last years maneuvers the 
exercises usually start in february and last about two months 
pyongyang long has called for a withdrawal of the 42000 troops 
the united states maintains in south korea under a mutual defense 
pact

congress found out the hard way what many of its counterparts in 
state capitals across the country already knew walk softly when 
youre trying to stick a big pay raise in your pocket 
true legislators in hawaii recently got a 73 percent increase 
but lawmakers in new hampshire make 100 a year and havent gotten a 
raise since 1889 
in alaska legislators got their pay cut in half to 22140 in 
1987 although they now get reimbursed for expenses the same year 
massachusetts voters rolled back a 10999 legislative salary hike 
in new mexico where legislators make 75 a day they have 
received only four raises since statehood in 1912 when the 
compensation was 5 a day in rhode island the pay is still 5 a 
day and no one seems to know if or when there ever was a raise 
the problem for lawmakers is summed up by state rep bob brawley 
who tried unsuccessfully to double legislative pay in north carolina 
to 21375 
everybodys going to use it for political fodder rather than 
the realities of the pay scale brawley said 
asked if he would resurrect the issue he joked you want to 
see everybody turn pale around here 
congress whose members are paid 89500 a year backed down on a 
proposed 51 percent raise tuesday after being set upon by 
consre considered parttime they 
often supplement their legislative pay with salaries from regular 
jobs still they usually dont have time to earn outside money 
while their legislature is meeting and sessions are generally 
getting longer 
new york legislators are the highest paid in the nation at 
57500 thanks to a 337 percent hike that went into effect this 
year 
angry massachusetts voters who rolled their legislators back to 
30000 in 1987 did not remove them from the elite in legislative 
pay only eight other states have scales above that illinois 
california michigan ohio oklahoma pennsylvania wisconsin and 
new york 
hawaiis 73 percent increase last november took lawmakers from 
15600 to 27000 based on recommendations by a state salary 
commission 
in several states such as florida legislative salaries are tied 
to salaries of other state employees so legislators get the same 
average increase 
the florida system went into effect in 1986 to avoid the kind of 
uproar that engulfed congress there was some controversy in 1985 
when salaries were raised for the first time in 16 years from 
12000 to 18000 florida legislators now get 20748 
in california where legislators are considered fulltime the 
constitution allows a 5 percent salary increase a year legislators 
make 40816 a year plus 87 a session day for expenses or about 
15000 a year they also get a stateleased car and gasoline credit 
card the other fulltime legislatures are massachusetts michigan 
and pennsylvania 
contrast that with neighboring nevada where legislative pay is 
130 a day plus 66 for living expenses but only for the first 60 
days of the session if the legislature meets longer they dont get 
paid the nevada legislature meets every other year and sessions 
have run as long as 150 days

lisbon said all 137 passengers were italian and the seven crew 
members were american she did not release any names 
the aircraft belonged to the us airline independent air corp 
based in smyrna tenn the flight originated in bergamo italy and 
was to have proceeded to puerto plata in the dominican republic and 
montego bay in jamaica after making a refueling stop in the azores 
the portuguese news agency lusa quoted an official from the 
azores civil protection service as saying about 50 bodies had been 
recovered and it appeared all on board died 
lusa also quoted an unidentified member of a local flying club as 
saying all the passengers and crew had been killed 
there are no survivors from the plane the club member was 
quoted as saying but there do not appear to any victims on the 
ground he added 
afonso pimentel a lusa reporter based in the azores said the 
boeing 707 was preparing to land at santa maria airport when it 
crashed into pico alto a fogcovered 1794foothigh mountain and 
burst into flames 
lusa quoted the civil protection official who was not 
identified as saying the pilot asked the airport to clear a runway 
for an emergency landing the civil protection service is a state 
body that provides rescue services and assistance in civilian

company had 12500 cycles or takeoffs and landings and less than 
50000 hours in the air 
jack barker spokesman for the federal aviation administration in 
atlanta said those figures were not unusually high for such an 
airplane 
if properly maintained there should not be a problem because 
of hours or number of cycles other aircraft involved in the news 
have had as much as 50000 cycles a great many more barker said 
in an interview 
the azores is a chain of 10 islands west of portugal santa maria 
is 750 miles west of portugal 
tom cole of boeing commercial airplanes in seattle said the plane 
that crashed was one of two 707320bs delivered to twa in february

the planes from twa or whether other companies owned the planes in 
between twa and independent air cole had no details on the planes 
service histories except that at some point their engines were 
adjusted to make them quieter

legislation to double the life span of a 
fiveyear program to curb steel imports was introduced in the senate 
on wednesday as critics claimed the quotas hurt the us economy and 
no longer are needed to protect domestic steelmakers 
the bill introduced by sens john d rockefeller dwva and 
john heinz rpa would extend the socalled voluntary restraint 
agreements for another five years beyond their scheduled september 
expiration 
the restraint pacts which currently cover 19 countries and the 
european community first were negotiated in 1984 to protect the 
beleaguered us industry from foreign producers who were dumping 
cheaper subsidized steel 
domestic steelmakers since then have scaled down and modernized 
their operations and rebounded they earned more than 2 billion in 
profits in 1988 operated at 96 percent of capacity and increased 
productivity 
rockefeller said the fruits of the restraint agreements are 
just beginning to be seen and that more time and investment is 
needed before domestic steelmakers can compete without the import 
limits 
this is not protection for the industry rockefeller said 
it is simply giving us a chance to survive and rebuild 
however a coalition of more than 190 steelusing companies and 
organizations announced it had organized to fight any extension of 
the quotas saying that continuing the restraints would do more harm 
than good 
the coalition of american steel using manufacturers released a 
study by the stern group an international trade advisory group 
which concluded that the quotas may help steelmakers in the short 
term but they burden steelusing industries cost jobs reduce 
exports and slow economic growth 
we and our workers are paying a terrible price to protect the 
us steel industry said timothy l elder of caterpillar inc in 
peoria ill a member of the coalition were paying through 
higher prices than our foreign competitors are paying for their 
steel were paying through availability problems that hamstring our 
operations on the factory floor 
paula stern a former chairwoman of the us international trade 
commission and president of the stern group said the groups study 
found that steel prices in the united states have risen 15 percent 
overall since 1986 and up to 40 percent for some steel products 
she said that because voluntary restraint agreements lead to 
higher steel prices and steel shortages extending them will hurt 
americas manufacturing industries stifle its export economy and 
worsen the us trade deficit 
heinz maintained that charges the restraints have caused higher 
prices and shortages are utterly without foundation 
the senators released a report by the congressional research 
service which found that foreign steelmakers did not fill their 
quotas during the first half of last year and any domestic 
increases in steel prices experienced after early in 1988 might not 
be explained by the vra quotas 
president bush during the fall campaign said he would support 
an extention of the import limits and heinz said the presidents 
staff has reaffirmed his commitment to renew the program the 
legislation was introduced with support from 46 cosponsors

stalinist socialism and key parts of marxist theory 
are wrong or outdated and the soviet union will start selling 
private homes and land a leading soviet economist said wednesday 
oleg bogomolov also said the stalinist system was borrowed or 
imposed on other countries and that other socialist countries 
should choose their own way of repairing the damage 
the soviet unions looming 160 billion 1990 budget deficit is 
a major stumbling block for president mikhail s gorbachevs 
program of perestroika bogomolo said at a foreign ministry news 
conference 
he said it might be solved by selling stateowned land to 
individuals and by importing video recorders and personal computers 
and taxing them at up to 10 times their value in the west 
scarce video recorders sell for about 6400 to 11200 in the 
soviet union personal computers cost about 48000 to 112000 
bogomolov the director of the institute of world socialist 
system economy came close to apologizing to the soviet bloc for 
saddling them with stalinism which failed to withstand the test 
of time 
noninterference in internal affairs and respect for the 
econonic interests of each other are equally important as in the 
past but now are realized more fully he said perhaps there 
were some violations 
now he said we still adhere to marxist theories but so much 
of this theory should be adjusted because many of the theories of 
marx failed to stand the test of time 
socialist countries are now trying their own ways he said 
diversity of experience and views is not a sign of weakness but a 
source of power he said 
in response to a question he said that hungary theoretically 
could turn further capitalistic in economics without leaving the 
warsaw pact and even a politically neutral hungary would not 
threaten soviet security 
he said the soviet union had found banning private property left 
farmers with no concern for the land and longterm development he 
predicted that the pending legalization of family farms will go 
further than previously stated and allow them to choose their own 
crops and sell them at market prices 
right now however there is no free market for agricultural 
implements or where agricultural produce is traded because 
farmers are told what to grow and must sell it at prices set by 
bureaucrats 
the soviet union is looking to the farming system of hungary in 
hopes of restoring the farmers interest in investing in the 
land since he does not own it bogomolov said he predicted 
longterm even lifetime leases on farmland and outright 
sale of plots for private houses 
we have many plots of land and many who would like to buy 
them to build homes summer dachas or cooperative apartments he 
indicated that would satisfy a populace disgusted with a perennial 
housing shortage sop up excess savings and help solve the 
government budget deficit 
bogomolov won attention several weeks ago for revealing the 
soviet budget deficit will exceed the us deficit next year even 
though the soviet economy is onethird the size of the american one 
he rejected the suggestion of other economists that the soviet 
union must use western credit to buy foreign goods to calm consumers 
increasingly unhappy with shortages 
the soviet union has extended its debt to a dangerous limit 
he said and further borrowing risks imitation of polands economic 
crisis 
instead he suggested paying soviet farmers half the hard 
currency now spent on foreign grain well have much more wheat 
he said and we could use the rest of the hard currency on 
consumer goods 
he also said production of soviet consumer goods is being 
doubled partially through conversion of defense plants he 
suggested abandoning costly projects including oilprocessing 
projects in siberia and the caspian sea region whose efficiency

a state house committee shot down a 
tongueincheek bill calling for 100 of the geese that winter on the 
lake outside the capitol building to sacrifice their lives to 
finance a fancy legislative retreat 
i think you could call this a golden goose of legislation 
rep roger porch a sponsor of the joke bill said tuesday as fowl 
puns and charges of featherbedding flew higher than migrating geese 
i hope the committee will take a good gander at this bill 
the measure called for a special hunting season that would allow 
100 outofstate residents to pay 10000 apiece for licenses 
permitting them to kill a capitol lake goose the revenue would be 
used to build a hunting lodge for lawmakers on nearby oahe 
reservoir porch said 
by the end of each legislative session lawmakers need a retreat 
because they suffer from shaking hands ringing ears and blurred 
vision and are just basically down said porch 
its known as goose down some people actually quack up the 
lawmaker said 
the bills other sponsor rep ed olson said he had polled the 
geese on the lake and they assured him they were willing to take 
part in the special season to back olsons claim a woman dressed 
up in a goose costume urged the house agriculture and natural 
resources committee to approve the special hunting season 
if anyone is dumb enough to pay 10000 for a hunting license 
are they going to be able to shoot any of us said the goose 
introduced as gloria gander i dont think so

a former nazi ss soldier who leads a 
growing extremist party told thousands of cheering supporters 
wednesday that young germans bear no guilt for hitlers 
extermination of 6 million jews 
franz schoenhuber an ss soldier in world war ii also criticized 
the president of the nations jewish community called for the 
reunification of germany and said the european economic community 
was detrimental to german farmers 
in a speech to several thousand supporters of his republican 
party which has surged in national polls the 66yearold 
politician denied being antisemitic 
there are jewish authors composers and painters i like he 
said but i dont like mr galinski 
heinz galinski who is 76 and survived the auschwitz death camp 
constantly reminds west germans of the horrors of the hitler era and 
criticizes antijewish tendencies of the extreme right wing 
mr galinski sabotages germanjewish reconciliation 
schoenhuber said galinski told the associated press by telephone 
from his home in west berlin there will be no comment from me 
because it is beneath my dignity to argue with mr schoenhuber 
schoenhuber fought in france and on the eastern front in world 
war ii then spent 1 years as a prisoner of the british the ss or 
schutzstaffel was a military unit of the nazi party and separate 
from the regular german army 
at the meeting in cham a town of 16000 people 80 miles 
northeast of munich he pounded his fist on the rostrum and 
declared todays young generation of germans is no more guilty 
for auschwitz than the sons and daughters of americans who committed 
genocide at hiroshima and nagasaki 
more than 5000 supporters feasting on beer and sausages in the 
packed hall interrupted schoenhubers twohour speech frequently 
with applause and shouts of bravo a bavarian brass band played 
before and after the speech 
particularly strong reactions greeted the leaders statements 
that we are proud to be germans and we are a law and order 
party 
the republican party got 75 percent of the vote in west berlin 
elections jan 29 gaining 11 seats in the city legislature its 
success in berlin automatically qualifies it for two seats in the 
federal parliament in bonn after the elections in december 1990 
a poll released last week by the respected wickert institute said 
the party founded in 1983 would get 115 percent of the national 
vote if elections were held now 
schoenhuber said one of his goals is unifying west germany with 
the communist east and making berlin the nations capital again he 
said the party is for europe but against this european economic 
community 
he said the eec helps farmers in greece spain and portugal but 
does nothing for those in west germany 
demonstrators protested peacefully earlier in the day but no 
incidents were reported at the threehour rally 
small groups outside the hall whistled and shouted nazis out 
police said a few dozen people gathered in protest at a downtown 
square 
about 30 people tried to block schoenhubers entry to the hall by 
placing chairs and musical instruments in his way police arrested 
eight who tried to unfurl banners with slogans against the party 
shoenhuber a former journalist criticized the news media for 
biased coverage of his party 
the nazis brought us the worst chapter of our history he 
said we dont want another hitler but we cant allow our history 
to be reduced to auschwitz 
he repeated the partys call for sending home millions of west 
germanys foreign workers and people from the third world who seek 
asylum 
we are not hostile to foreigners but we are friendly to the

president bush said today he has seen no 
evidence that would cause him to lose confidence in defense 
secretarydesignate john tower whose senate confirmation vote has 
been delayed for at least 10 days 
senior democrats on the armed services committee said earlier 
that the fbi was reviewing allegations about the former texas 
senators finances 
have i seen anything or has anything in the fbi report made me 
want to change my mind as one who would be concerned about 
insobriety or about failure to be ready for duty 24 hours a day the 
answer is no i have not bush said 
i have seen nothing not one substantive fact that makes me 
change my mind about john towers ability to be secretary of defense 
and be a very good one bush said 
if somebody else sees the evidence that they want to interpret 
differently thats not only their right but their obligation he 
said 
bush said he was not criticizing the investigation process but 
was upset that unsubstantiated rumors were being circulated and were 
hurting tower 
whats gone too far is allegations that the senators themselves 
would agree are totally unfounded to have been floated around for a 
long period of time and damaged the integrity and honor of a decent 
man and that is not good he said 
and everyone here knows its not fair he added 
bush was asked to explain how some senators reviewing the same 
material he has seen have expressed reservations about the 
nomination 
then my appeal would be if youve made up your mind let the 
process go forward lets have the vote they have an obligation 
to vote their conscience bush said 
at the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the new 
allegation relates to sen towers activities while he was in the 
senate he refused to elaborate but said president bush still 
stands by tower and expects that he will be confirmed 
sen sam nunn dga the armed services committee chairman told 
reporters he could not vote to confirm tower until the latest 
allegations were checked and said he had told president bush that 
at a white house meeting on tuesday night 
i told the president frankly that i have serious concerns and 
i also stated that if a vote was held immediately as some have 
urged i would vote no because of these concerns nunn told 
reporters 
there are new allegations of a financial nature which are now 
being checked in the tower nomination he said 
the administration had been pushing for a vote this week but 
dropped the request after nunn and the ranking republican on the 
armed services panel sen john warner of virginia met with bush 
they really cant vote until this matter is checked out 
fitzwater said 
the spokesman said nunns assertion that he would vote against 
tower if a vote were held now was disappointing very 
disappointing 
the secondranking democrat on the committee sen james exon of 
nebraska said the latest fbi report on tower could not be complete 
by friday when the senate is scheduled to begin a weeklong recess 
as a practical matter they cant draw it out too long exon 
told reporters 
the senate majority leader george mitchell of maine said on the 
floor of the senate that all members of that body wanted a chance to 
thoroughly review the fbi report on tower and therefore i dont 
see how it is possible to bring the matter to a vote this week 
republicans immediately rushed to defend the nominee 
the senate republican leader bob dole said in response to 
mitchell that he had spoken with tower on the telephone this morning 
and found him upbeat about the nomination 
he is aware of the new allegation said dole adding that 
tower thinks his nomination should be confirmed and he is hanging 
in there 
another republican on the committee william cohen of maine said 
that once these remaining questions are answered tower will 
have considerable support bipartisan support both of the committee 
and on the senate floor 
and cohen cautioned against allowing the tower nomination to turn 
into a partisan wrangle between democrats and republicans 
frankly that would not bode well certainly for relations with 
the administration but it wouldnt bode well for the congress of 
the united states itself especially here in the senate he said 
exon said that allegations continued to flow concerning towers 
drinking and financial affairs but that he would not know the 
specifics until the fbi report is complete 
ninety percent of the allegations are garbage said exon 
specifically disputing a rumor that tower had an affair with a 
dancer who had defected from the soviet bloc 
the remaining allegations he said concerned towers drinking 
habits and his ability to avoid a conflict of interest with defense 
contractors from whom he collected more than 1 million as a 
consultant 
asked by reporters whether towers alcohol consumption was his 
chief concern nunn said 
i dont want to categorize it like that thats one of my 
primary concerns the question there is whether there has been an 
alcohol abuse problem if there has been a problem in the past is 
there a point where it has been recognized by the nominee and dealt 
with effectively that is to say is it a continuing problem i do 
not have an answer to that yet 
he added its not a matter of one or two episodes its a 
question of whether theres a continuing pattern its a matter 
of a person in the chain of command that has control over the 
arsenal of the united states of america the secretary of 
defense has to in my view have clarity of thought at all times 
tower went to the white house this morning for a regularly 
scheduled breakfast with secretary of state james a baker and 
national security adviser brent scowcroft in scowcrofts office 
said fitzwater bush did not attend 
the meeting at about 730 am was in continuing a tradition set 
during the reagan administration when thennational security adviser 
colin powell met for regular breakfasts with the secretary of state 
and defense secretary 
as tower was at the white house nunn told reporters on capitol 
hill that presidential consel boyden gray has informed me that the 
white house now agrees that the committee should not vote on his 
confirmation 
the open criticism of tower by his former senate colleagues was 
extraordinary senators rarely are willing to speak about the 
personal behavior of their colleagues tower a texas republican 
chaired the armed services committee from 1981 through 1984 
at this stage theres no doubt about it there are serious 
questions remaining said nunn 
the committee had originally hoped to vote on the confirmation 
last week then had counted on taking up the confirmation today 
after receiving what was to have been the final fbi report before 
the new allegation surfaced 
the president told nunn that tower was an excellent nominee and 
hoped thered be a vote soon fitzwater said he nunn did not 
speak out against it or ask that it be withdrawn 
warner had said earlier in the day that he had been briefed by 
the white house about what was expected to be the final fbi inquiry 
before the new allegation he in turn briefed the gop members of 
the committee 
the gop senators said a preliminary fbi report provided no 
grounds to disqualify tower 
but the separate gop briefings angered nunn and may have helped 
push the democrats toward opposition 
obviously there have been some unofficial briefings going on 
that i as chairman of the committee have not been part of nunn 
said

the aids virus may become a permanent part of 
the american scene a report said wednesday unless those most at 
risk change their sexual activities and drug habits to do that the 
study called for a massive survey of the most intimate details of 
life in the united states 
the report by the national research council called for aids blood 
tests from key elements of the population including newborns and 
women seeking abortions improved sex education techniques among the 
young safe injection education for drug users and more frank 
communication about aids on television networks 
most importantly though the study said that without more 
knowledge about the activities of homosexuals prostitutes drug 
users and even ordinary citizens other efforts stand little 
chance of success 
our committee believes that the public health threat posed by 
aids is so great that we must find ways to overcome social and 
cultural taboos that stand in the way of improved aids prevention 
and we must do so quickly lincoln e moses a stanford university 
professor who chaired the nrc committee said at a news conference 
the studys director charles f turner said that researchers 
are tripping continually over massive deficiencies in our 
understanding of the basic behaviors by which the virus is spread 
those deficiencies have to be filled if we are going to do better 10 
years from now in controlling the transmission of this deadly 
disease 
the committee said the battle against aids may extend into the 
22nd century even if a medical cure is found moses noted that a 
cure antibiotics was developed 40 years ago for many sexually 
transmitted diseases that remain major public health problems 
already the report said the human immunodeficiency virus hiv 
is substantially seeded in the us population the number of 
people who are now infected may surpass 1 million and the virus is 
likely to continue to spread if not in epidemic form then in a 
persistent more stable endemic form 
this disease is only spread by social behavior said moses 
we have no weapon to combat the spread of hiv other than modifying 
our behavior someday the virologists will find an effective therapy 
or vaccine but it will remain largely a social disease 
proposed were vigorous programs of research into american 
sexual habits including sex outside of marriage between people of 
the same gender with people of both genders with prostitutes and 
variations in sexual techniques among the various types of sexual 
partnerings 
it also said the sexual habits of people who inject drugs should 
be studied 
with enough survey data moses said programs can be designed to 
discourage unsafe sex and drug practices in clear explicit 
language in the idiom of the target audience 
we now have an epidemic in which we have a great need for an 
undersanding of sexual behaviors of all types including those that 
dont deal with procreation turner said 
the panel said that moral education alone an approach favored by 
many in the reagan administration will not be effective in 
controlling sexual behavior 
said committee member marshall h becker 
if the major emphasis is placed on just say no it is a sort 
of moral meanspiritedness we are engaged in where we are in effect 
saying if you refuse to play the game die 
that is a terrible stance to take said becker we owe it 
to the young people of our nation to give them more options than 
that 
he said the war on aids should have a moral component but he 
said it would effectively reach only a limited number of 
individuals 
instead said becker the panel recommended plainlanguage 
education campaigns that would give teenage americans options to 
encourage the use of condoms and other safe sex practices 
indeed the council recommended that condoms be readily 
available to all sexually active persons and that a study be 
conducted to determine how effective condoms and spermicides are in 
lowering the risk of hiv infection 
the 589page study aids sexual behavior and interavenous 
drug use includes these recommendations among others 
expanded programs to teach safe injection techniques to drug 
users needlesharing among drug users is thought to be a major way 
in which aids is spread 
treatment for all sexually transmitted diseases that are thought 
to speed the spread of aids 
more public service messages on the television networks dealing 
with methods of avoiding aids 
acceptance by the networks of condom advertisements 
aids destroys the bodys immune system and its ability to fight 
infection patients usually die of infections or cancers 
the disease is usually spread through sexual contact but can 
also be transmitted through contact with infected blood and blood 
products and given by a a pregnant woman to her child 
most of the victims in the united states are homosexuals or 
intravenous drug users 
the national research council is an arm of the national academy 
of sciences a private nonprofit group that advises the government 
on scientific matters

reporting the length of film used in an average movie the error 
occurred in a story about the 100th anniversary of eastman kodak 
cos motionpicture film products 
the average movie film at 90 feet of film per minute is about 
9000 to 12000 feet long 
kodak estimates filmmakers use at least 20 times more negative 
film than the finished product requires which means an average 
movie might use 180000 to 240000 feet of film if 1000 prints are 
needed a studio must buy 9 million feet to 12 million feet of print

the asian bull elephant that crushed to death 
a trainer at busch gardens will be spared but will be sold to a 
facility better equipped to handle a growing threeton pachyderm 
officials at the african theme park have agreed to sell casey 
the 17yearold elephant that killed handler joe allen 34 sunday 
as he led the elephant back to its pen 
we certainly dont want to handle him here anymore park 
public releations director glenda gilmore said tuesday 
gilmore said caseys owner roman schmitt will try to find 
someone interested in buying him 
allens widow mattie allen expressed some satisfaction over the 
decision 
thank god hes leaving she said id rather theyd killed 
it but if they ship it away from busch gardens im glad 
witnesses say allen either tripped or was pushed down by the 
elephants trunk the bull dipped his head placed it against the 
handlers chest and pushed down 
federal occupational safety and health administration officials 
are investigating but didnt immediately determine whether busch 
gardens should be held accountable to an osha spokesman 
but some specialists say it will not be easy to find a buyer for 
a male pachyderm that has killed a person 
the best way to handle these bull elephants the only safe way 
is to keep them separate and dont handle them said mike 
schmidt a veterinarian who works with elephants at the washington 
park zoo in portland ore a lot of those bulls are like ticking 
clocks waiting to go off its a calculated risk 
portland officials often get up to 50000 for a 2yearold 
female calf and less for the unpredictable bull calves schmidt 
said an older bull may be worth even less especially if it has 
killed someone 
schmitt brought the elephant to busch gardens four months ago as 
a second breeding bull he bought it last year from a texas man who 
used casey for rides at circuses

north korea and cuba were designated wednesday 
by a top state department official as the worlds worst human rights 
violators in 1988 because of their efforts to convert their people 
into automatons through repressive mechanisms 
what we are talking about here is total repression said 
assistant secretary of state richard schifter who spoke on the 
occasion of the release of the state departments annual human 
rights report 
at a news conference schifter likened north korea to a 
nightmare state where the government tries really to turn 
people into automatons 
as far as cuba is concerned there is an effort there to try to 
achieve the same thing in terms of total penetration of the country 
by secret police truly spying on every citizen he said 
schifter acknowledged that other analysts who judge regimes by 
the number of governmentsponsored killings of political opponents 
would be less critical of cuba 
he conceded that he is unaware of any such killings in cuba in 
1988 the country with the largest number of killings in 1988 he 
said was sudan where there was largescale starvation because 
government and opposition forces refused to allow emergency food 
deliveries to refugees in contested areas 
the cuban diplomatic mission here said in reply to schifters 
comments that the united states has no international mandate and 
even less the moral authority to judge or give opinions about the 
internal situation in cuba 
we therefore attribute no importance to the opinions that the 
state department may have about our country 
president fidel castro has said that cuba has the worlds most 
enviable human rights record because of the gains cuba has made in 
such areas as health and education and in maintaining unemployment 
at low levels 
castro also has said that a vigilant attitude among his people 
must be maintained because of numerous us threats against cuba and 
the many americansponsored sabotage and assassination attempts 
the section on north korea in the human rights report said north 
korea subjects its people to rigid controls 
the report said the regime establishes security ratings for every 
resident that determine access to employment schools medical 
facilities and stores as well as admission to the ruling party 
the report added that the government imprisons people who fail 
to conform to the dictates of the state and often exiles them 
together with their families to remote villages 
on cuba the report said mass organizations attempt to extend 
cuban government and communist party control over each citizens 
daily activities at home work and school 
citizens are exhorted to ensure ideological conformity and to 
report deviation it said

trap doors on shrimp nets save the lives of 
sea turtles but they also cause a significant reduction in the 
shrimpers catch studies show 
the studies presented at a sea turtle conference wednesday showed 
the turtle excluder devices called teds are effective in releasing 
sea turtles from shrimpers nets but led to a loss of about 8 
percent in the shrimp catch 
state regulations mandating use of the devices went into effect 
in many inshore waters feb 1 while federal regulations making teds 
mandatory go into effect may 1 
the preliminary results of the studies were presented at the 9th 
annual workshop on sea turtle conservation and biology being held 
through saturday on jekyll island fourteen nations are represented 
a ted is a barrier in the narrow neck of a shrimpers 
funnelshaped net which guides things too large to get through such 
as large fish or sea turtles out a trap door in the top or bottom 
of the net shrimp pass through the barrier to be trapped in the 
basket at the bottom of the funnel 
in a national oceanic and atmospheric administration study no 
sea turtles were captured in nets equipped with teds while 24 
turtles were caught in nets without the devices said ed klima of 
the agency two of the 24 died before they could be released 
observers who have spent 307 days on shrimp boats along the 
atlantic coast and in the gulf of mexico near the midpoint of the 
projected 700day project also found the devices resulted in an 
average loss of about 8 percent of the shrimp catch 
but klima added i see that coming out pretty close to zero 
with experience by the fishing crew 
in a separate study by the university of georgia marine extension 
service scientists found an 8 percent reduction in the shrimp 
harvest said d kendall who was optimistic shrimpers will find a 
solution to the problem 
sea turtles are something shrimpers dont want to catch 
kendall said theyre a pain to have to deal with on the deck of 
the boat

us officials sought to assure congress 
wednesday that soviet jews and people from vietnam are not in 
competition for admission to refugee status in america 
numbers are not going to be a problem and east asian 
refugees are not going to be pitted against east european refugees 
for us entry said ambassador jonathan moore us coordinator for 
refugee affairs 
rep stephen j solarz dny chairman of the house foreign 
affairs committees subcommittee on asian and pacific affairs 
raised the issue at a hearing 
solarz asked moore if he meant that not a single vietnamese 
will be obliged to remain behind who otherwise would have been able 
to leave his homeland but for the transfer of 6500 us refugee 
entry slots from asians to east europeans at the end of last year 
thats correct moore replied he said the vietnamese 
government is processing emigrants under its orderly departure 
program at a pace that rendered the 6500 slots surplus at the end 
of 1988 they were used for soviet and east european refugees after 
the soviet union relaxed its departure rules for jews and others 
long waiting to leave 
rep nancy pelosi dcalif told the subcommittee that she and 
others in congress have written to president bush and secretary of 
state james a baker iii opposing reductions in resettlement 
programs involving vietnamese 
the 1989 ceiling of 19500 vietnamese entrants compares with 
7000 last year thus movements out of vietnam will increase 
dramatically over those of last year said moore 
the 1989 us refugee quota has been set at 94000 worldwide

a wild golden eagle was recovering 
wednesday from surgery on both wings after it was found shot and 
veterinarians concentrated on building up the feeble birds strength 
state and federal authorities sought the publics help in 
determining who shot the bird in southern kentucky 
its in a very poor nutritional state said dr loran wagoner 
of the skyline animal clinic it apparently had been shot for 
about a week before it was caught 
the adult male 10 pounds with a 6foot wingspan was found 
tuesday by three state highway department employees near sharon 
grove the workers turned the wounded bird over to sgt gerald 
barnett of the state department of fish and wildlife in elkton 
four veterinarians performed surgery on the eagle at the animal 
clinic 
the upper bones in both wings were broken when the eagle was 
hit with buckshot wagoner said we have intramedullary pins 
holding the bones tight it will be a matter of him strengthening 
his bones again before he can fly 
of more immediate concern to wagoner is building the eagles 
strength so it can be taken to the louisville zoo for recovery 
right now were trying to feed him chicken parts and beef 
he said weve managed to get a little bit down by forcefeeding 
him 
wagner said its important that the eagle be transferred to the 
zoo soon 
they lose the will to live he explained even though the 
zoo has a controlled environment it is more familiar to the bird 
its important not to handle them any more than necessary

the nations highest court on 
wednesday affirmed the convictions of two elderly doctors for taking 
part in the nazis mercy killing of more than 11500 handicapped 
people 
the ruling ended one of the last major nazirelated trials in 
west germany and closed out 28 years of criminal proceedings against 
dr aquilin ulrich and dr heinrich bunke 
in may 1987 a frankfurt court convicted ulrich and bunke of 
accessory to murder for participating in the killing of thousands of 
people most of them mentally retarded during 1940 and 1941 
ulrich and bunke both now 74 years old claimed they were 
following orders as part of the nazis euthanasia action which 
also was aimed at some physically handicapped people 
the federal court of justice in karlsruhe ruled there was proof 
bunke took part in the gaschamber deaths of at least 9200 patients 
and that ulrich killed at least 2340 people 
while affirming the convictions of accessory to murder the court 
also ordered the original sentence of four years reduced to three 
years for each doctor 
both doctors are now free as they were throughout their 
trial frankfurt prosecutors spokesman gernot broschat told the 
associated press i assume that they will go to prison 
both men say they are in failing health and are likely to resist 
any efforts to imprison them 
the two served as deputy directors at the brandenburg camp near 
berlin and in the bernburg camp near the northwestern part of what 
is now east germany 
evidence at the trial showed the doctors role included examining 
incoming patients and fabricating causes of death to report to 
victims relatives others at the camps were primarily responsible 
for the actual operation of the gas chambers 
the nazis claimed their euthanasia action was designed to help 
hopelessly ill patients with no hope of recovery more than 70000 
such patients were killed 
ulrike and bunke who both practiced gynecology after world war 
ii went on trial in the 1960s following lengthy investigations 
they were acquitted when the court ruled they were forced by the 
nazis to take part in the mercy killings 
the federal court of justice overturned the ruling in 1970 and 
ordered a retrial which was delayed for years by the ill health of 
both doctors 
ulrich practiced in the southern city of stuttgart after world 
war ii and bunke worked in the northeastern town of celle

the jan 1 inventory of cattle and calves on 
the nations farms and ranches edged down again to a 28year low of 
99484000 head from 99524000 a year ago the agriculture 
department said wednesday 
but the decline has slowed and there were indications many beef 
producers have started rebuilding their herds a year ago the us 
cattle herd was down 24 percent from the 102 million head that had 
been estimated jan 1 1987 this years decline was less than 1 
percent 
this slowed the recent downtrend in cattle inventories that 
began six years ago and was the second consecutive inventory below 
100 million head since 1961 the departments agricultural 
statistics board said 
the estimate was in line with recent predictions of usda 
analysts who say the shrinkage in the overall cattle herd may be 
starting to rebound as producers hold back breeding stock to 
rebuild herds beef output is expected to decline in the short run 
overall according to usda forecasts 1989 beef production may 
decline 5 percent to 7 percent from last year to the lowest level 
since 1980 
but large supplies of pork and poultry are expected and that 
could leave this years total meat output at only slightly below the 
record level of 1988 even so retail beef prices are expected to 
set records this year 
as of jan 1 the number of beef cows and heifers that have 
calved totaled 439 million head up 1 percent from a year ago the 
first increase following six consecutive years of decline 
beef cows were reported at 337 milion head up 2 percent from 
jan 1 1988 and dairy cows at 102 million head down 1 percent 
it was the smallest inventory of us milk cows since 1872 the 
report said 
the 1988 calf crop was estimated at almost 409 million head up 
2 percent from 1987 
analysts said the value of all cattle and calves as of jan 1 was 
estimated at about 604 billion up 16 percent from 52 billion a 
year earlier the average value was reported at 607 per head 
compared with 523 the previous year 
some other categories included 
all heifers 500 pounds and over 173 million head up 1 percent 
from a year ago 
beef replacement heifers 551 million up 5 percent 
milk replacement heifers 42 million up 2 percent 
other heifers 763 million down 2 percent 
steers weighing 500 pounds and over 158 million up 
fractionally 
bulls weighing 500 pounds and over 222 million up 3 percent 
calves under 500 pounds 202 million down 4 percent 
all cattle and calves being fed for slaughter 112 million 
down 3 percent

jamaicans will decide thursday whether 
to continue the conservative government of prime minister edward 
seaga or as the leading pollster predicts return to michael 
manleys leftist policies 
the pollster carl stone says his surveys forecast a landslide 
for manley a socialist who led a radical procuba government 
during the 1970s but has moderated his position seaga a strong 
us ally has been in office since 1980 
stone who is associated with the university of the west indies 
says the leftofcenter peoples national party manley leads will 
win 48 of the 60 seats in parliament 
this will be the first contested national election since 1980 
when an estimated 700 people were killed in politically related 
violence during a ninemonth campaign 
manley boycotted the election seaga called in 1983 in a dispute 
over voter registration leaving seagas centerright jamaica labor 
party with all 60 seats 
at least 10 people have died in the current campaign which is 
taking place at the height of the caribbean islands winter tourist 
season and was shortened to just over three weeks 
violence has been confined to the kingston slums and rural towns 
far from the big tourist hotels on the north coast 
ash wednesday was a holiday in jamaica and there was no 
campaigning 
manley ended his campaign tuesday night with a plea for peace 
two shooting deaths were reported earlier in the day 
we cannot build a jamaica that is worth anything unless we all 
begin with a respect for life he told thousands of supporters 
gathered at a city square in the capital 
seagas last campaign day was spent in a walking tour of his west 
kingston constituency where thousands of people lined the streets 
to cheer him on in a radio broadcast that night he announced plans 
to create 200000 jobs in five years in order to reduce the 
unemployment rate from 21 percent to 15 
he said the manley government that preceded his had taken jamaica 
to the brink of collapse with illconceived economic programs 
seaga 58 was born in boston and educated at harvard he has 
presided over a businessoriented government and was the first 
official foreign visitor to the reagan white house in 1981 he was 
an outspoken supporter of the 1983 us invasion of grenada 
manley 64 attended the london school of economics and was prime 
minister in 19721980 he has projected a moderate prous image 
in contrast to his former farleft position manley said this week 
he had abandoned all thoughts of nationalization and wanted 
private business to have a free hand 
he said he would restore relations with cuba during his first 
year in office but on a restricted and formal basis seaga broke 
relations with fidel castros government upon taking office in 1980 
jamaicans widely regard seaga who seeks an unprecedented third 
consecutive term as a skilled manager who is aloof and autocratic 
manley whose father norman founded the peoples national party is 
a magnetic man seen as a champion of the people but a worry to 
business leaders and jamaicas foreign trading partners 
seaga has restored the economy through a rigid program that 
emphasized tourism and exports raised taxes and reduced social 
services such as health and education 
the standard of living of the islands 24 million people has 
continued to decline however and seagas popularity has waned

a financially troubled magazine of the 
nations leading opposition party on wednesday got a chance to keep 
espousing leftist causes when party leaders delayed a plan to close 
it 
two weeks ago leaders of the social democratic party said the 
112yearold publication which outlasted bans by bismarck and 
hitler was losing too much money and would have to be shut down 
the decision prompted an angry outcry from inside and outside party 
ranks 
in the wake of that criticism party leaders gathered wednesday 
and decided to delay the shutdown of the weekly magazine 
vorwaerts which means forward 
the magazines editor guenter verheugen said closing the 
publication would silence an important voice in the history of 
social democracy 
the publications last issue was delivered feb 4 and employees 
were ordered to abandon this weeks edition 
under wednesdays agreement party leaders will allow 
vorwaerts to continue publication until officials meet again 
later this month to weigh the magazines future 
well work around the clock for the next two days if we have to 
in order to get the issue out on time said gode japs the 
magazines executive editor 
earlier in the day nervous employees huddled in small groups in 
the magazines cluttered editorial officies in bad godesberg to 
await the decision 
there hasnt been much to do here said japs weve been 
answering mail organizing our files and discussing what to do 
next 
japs said 47 people could lose their jobs if the magazine folds 
but he said employees were determined to fight to keep the 
publication going he said morale also was boosted by a flood of 
letters from readers expressing support and several hundred 
spontaneous new subscriptions 
party officials announcing the decision to shut down the magazine 
said they saw little hope of boosting the circulation of 46000 by 
50 percent they said the new subscriptions are needed to cover 
rising costs and operating shortfalls 
founded in 1876 by wilhelm hasenclever and wilhelm liebknecht 
the magazine was forced into a 12year hiatus when chancellor otto 
von bismarck banned the social democrats in 1878 
vorwaerts which took a strident antinazi line was banned 
by adolf hitler after he came to power in 1933 its staff went into 
exile but continued to publish in prague and then paris until german 
troops invaded france in 1940 
the magazine reappeared in 1948 as the official organ of the 
social democratic party in west germany in its latest edition it 
covered a broad range of topics including the election of 
extremeright candidates to the west berlin parliament and 
developments in the soviet union israel italy and yugoslavia 
party officials say the glossy magazine could revert to a 
newspaper format in an effort to cut costs estimates of its 
operating deficit from party and magazine sources vary ranging from 
26 million to 295000

seven black detainees who 
started a hunger strike 16 days ago were hospitalized wednesday with 
ailments brought on by their refusal to eat a human rights lawyer 
said 
another 105 blacks joined the hunger strike raising to about 300 
the number of detainees threatening to starve themselves unless they 
are freed or charged a civil rights group said 
the hunger strike represents one of the most dramatic challenges 
to the policy of detention without trial since the national state of 
emergency was declared in june 1986 to quell racial unrest 
seven men who helped initiate the hunger strike at johannesburgs 
diepkloof prison on jan 23 were transferred to johannesburg 
hospital said attorney azhar cachalia 
cachalia who represents one of the seven told a news conference 
he did not know the condition of the men 
the hospital superintendent could not be contacted and other 
personnel refused to answer questions about the men 
the minister of law and order adriaan vlok released a statement 
saying the state cannot allow itself to be blackmailed by way of 
hunger strikes 
the hunger strikers must realize that the government has a duty 
toward society and they will be detained as long as it is in the 
interests of public safety the statement said 
the black sash a nationwide civil rights organization said 105 
detainees at st albans prison in port elizabeth including many 
held since 1986 joined the strike monday 
notwithstanding 32 months of continuous detention without 
trial no case has been brought against us the strikers said in a 
statement wednesday we are left with no alternative but to take 
our lives into our own hands and to demand our immediate release 
from this dehumanizing detention 
the statement said the detainees would consume no food or liquids 
until their demands were met 
an estimated 30000 people have been detained without charge for 
varying periods during the state of emergency an estimated 1000 to 
1500 people remain in detention 
a legal aid group lawyers for human rights called on vlok to 
amend detention regulations to limit detention without trial to 
three months and to allow detainees to be visited by lawyers and 
relatives 
the hunger strike was started by 20 detainees at diepkloof 
prison about 170 more detainees at diepkloof subsequently joined 
the strike 
according to the black sash the detainees at st albans prison 
include more than 50 antiapartheid leaders in their third year of 
detention including prominent activists who helped organize a 
successful black consumer boycott in 1985 
under apartheid south africas 26 million blacks have no voice 
in national affairs while the 5 million whites control the economy 
and maintain separate schools districts and health services

a legislator wrote in a state newspaper 
wednesday that poland should publish its version of the world war ii 
massacre of polish officers in the katyn forest and not wait for 
the conclusions of soviet historians 
ryszard wojna the communist party caucus leader in the sejm or 
parliament said soviet historians have had polands secret report 
and unpublished documents on the massacre for more than a year and 
have not responded 
a joint polishsoviet historical commission has been reassessing 
the massacre since april 1987 as part of efforts to remove blank 
spots in the history of the two nations 
officially poland and the soviet union blame the massacre of the 
4300 polish officers on the nazis but historians in the west and 
most poles believe the officers taken into soviet custody soon after 
the outbreak of the war were killed by soviet security police on 
josef stalins orders 
the victims found at katyn were among 15000 polish military 
prisoners who disappeared after being interned by the soviets among 
them were 8300 officers half the polish armys prewar officer 
corps 
the fate of polish officers and enlisted men held at two other 
camps has never been revealed 
soviets say the officers at katyn fell into the hands of 
advancing nazi troops while on a roadbuilding mission near 
smolensk and were killed by the gestapo the nazi security police 
public revelation of the killings by the nazis in 1943 and a 
polish request for an international investigation created tensions 
and led the soviet government to break relations with the polish 
governmentinexile in london 
shortly afterward stalin set up his own polish committee in 
moscow that became the seed of polands postwar communist government 
publication of wojnas article in the government daily republic 
indicated his proposal already has official approval 
by publishing the expertise of polish scientists we shall 
weaken the painful burdens on polishsoviet relations said 
wojnas article 
the information on the stance taken by polish scientists 
cannot be reserved any longer only for the soviet members the 
entire soviet society has the right to know this stance and the 
newly revealed documents 
he said the soviets should know that such painful matters 
cannot be kept under the cover of scientific discretion for they may 
make the cover explode

foreign ministers of eight commonwealth 
nations wednesday called for tougher sanctions against south africa 
saying financial embargos are among the most powerful weapons to use 
against apartheid 
among countries criticized for not giving more muscle to 
financial sanctions was canada whose external affairs minister joe 
clark chaired the meeting of the commonwealth committee on south 
africa 
during the threeday meeting which ended wednesday clark told 
fellow ministers he found trade figures reflecting a 44 percent 
increase in canadian exports to south africa and 67 percent increase 
in imports from south africa in 1988 very embarrassing 
the foreign ministers tasked by the 48nation commonwealth of 
former british colonies to explore ways to toughen economic 
sanctions against south africa reviewed the terms of existing bans 
to plug loopholes clark told reporters 
he said he was not embarrassed by criticism at the meeting 
because his government approved a 504 million loan by the canadian 
bank of nova scotia to a luxembourgbased company owned 71 percent 
by south africas oppenheimer family oppenheimers own the de beers 
diamond monopoly and a major stockholding in the south african 
mining and ranching conglomerate anglo american corp 
media reports said the canadian loan was needed for minorcos 
44 billion takeover bid for londonbased consolidated goldfields 
which has substantial mining interests in south africa 
clark said the loan to the luxembourg company minorco did not 
breach canadas prohibition on investment in south africa as it was 
not made to a south africanbased company 
that action is in bounds he said in question now is the 
adequacy of the ban we have in place we have to see if it reflects 
the intent of the commonwealth 
the meeting ending with several resolutions including a call for 
world financial institutions to deny loan and debt rescheduling 
facilities to south africa 
in a final statement the ministers identified financial 
sanctions in world money markets as one of the most powerful 
sources of pressure to force pretoria to abandon its legal system 
of racial separation called apartheid

saudi arabia has readmitted former ugandan 
dictator idi amin to exile after he slipped back into east africa 
for three weeks arab diplomats in the kingdom said wednesday 
but one diplomat said amin will doubtless lose his last 
refuge if he continues political activities and statements 
the diplomats reached in jiddah by telephone said amin returned 
to the red sea port city about a week ago 
the burly 61yearold amin fled to libya after he was ousted in 
april 1979 by his main political rival milton obote when libyan 
leader col moammar gadhafi rejected him eight months later he was 
granted political asylum by saudi arabia 
in later months amin was joined by one of his two wives and his 
22 children 
idi amin has been accepted again in the kingdom as a political 
refugee on the explicit condition that he keep his mouth shut and 
cease meddling in politics one jiddahbased diplomat told the 
associated press on condition of anonymity he also promised not 
to leave here surreptitiously again 
amin left his home in suburban jiddah with one of his sons on 
false passports and surfaced on jan 3 in zaire where the 
government quickly expelled him 
at first he shuttled between zaire and senegal when it became 
clear he had also become persona non grata in saudi arabia amin had 
displeased his saudi hosts with impromptu political statements and 
telephone interviews about african politics primarily his frequent 
declarations that he would return to kampala and recapture power in 
his east african country 
the diplomats said saudi authorities have posted guards at amins 
home

high heels for a stroll about her condo 
palm beach county circuit judge richard burk ruled tuesday that 
if mrs rogers again bothers her downstairs neighbors with noisy 
nocturnal footsteps she could be held in contempt of court 
i feel that i have been treated like jack the ripper mrs 
rogers said wednesday 
bernard and sonja arbuse who live directly below mrs rogers at 
the sun and surf condominium claimed in court the problem began 
five years ago when mrs rogers had italian tile laid in her 
235000 condo at the seaside complex 
the judge refused a request by the couples attorney charles 
nugent that mrs rogers be ordered to install carpeting 
i dont believe mrs rogers is required to give up her right to 
decorate said burk and i dont believe i can require her to 
stop walking 
mrs rogers who said she has not worn high heels in her 
apartment for 3 years praised the judge for allowing her to keep 
the italian tiles 
but im at the mercy of my neighbors she complained if 
they think they hear something then i can be held in contempt of

secretary of state james a baker iii warning 
of massive human suffering in sudan issued an urgent appeal 
wednesday for a ceasefire in that nations civil war so emergency 
food supplies can be rushed to victims of the fighting 
the death toll from starvation in 1988 alone is estimated in 
the hundreds of thousands baker said in a statement 
baker asked both the sudanese government and the rebels based in 
southern sudan to put peace first and allow relief to flow to 
the needy 
the us government is profoundly concerned about massive human 
suffering in sudan he said most of the wars victims are 
civilians who are displaced and impoverished or who starve to death 
for lack of delivery of available food 
up until late last year both sides in the civil war refused to 
allow emergency food deliveries to refugees in contested areas 
hoping to gain an advantage 
the department has estimated that largescale starvation has 
claimed between 100000 to 250000 people in the past year alone 
the sixyear war has also resulted in massive dislocations us 
officials believe that up to 2 million people have been displaced 
including 360000 forced to flee into neighboring ethiopia 
in its annual human rights report issued this week the 
department charged sudan with the largest number of victims in 
1988 and serious human rights violations stemming from the war 
and the interference with international aid organizations 
baker warned that failure to act before the rainy season sets in 
will mean that thousands more will die 
asking for immediate international cooperation baker pledged 
that the united states will do all it can to support this relief 
effort 
the sad reality however is that starvation will almost 
certainly not end until the fighting ends as friends of sudan we 
urge the sudanese government and the sudanese peoples liberation 
army to put peace first and agree to an early ceasefire which would 
allow relief to reach those in need baker wrote 
a ceasefire which is necessary for getting relief to all 
those in need is most urgent the statement said

president bush and a pentagon official on 
wednesday denied any plans to send us troops to destroy south 
american drug laboratories but bush said he wouldnt rule it out in 
the future 
asked about an nbc news report that such an effort was being 
prepared bush said nobodys discussed that with me and added 
that he is very wary of committing us troops overseas 
he said he would never take such action until ive given it a 
lot of thought 
bush added there could be times working cooperatively with 
leaders in the hemisphere that american assistance would be sought 
and american assistance would be granted in wiping out insidious 
factories that send poison in to poison our kids so you dont 
rule something out 
nbc reported tuesday that the administration was preparing a 
major drug interdiction plan that would put several hundred 
special operations commandos into several south american nations 
there isnt any such plan said maj david super a defense 
department spokesman weve spent all day batting down the 
report 
super said he didnt know if that might be one of the options 
being tossed around as part of possibly greater involvement by the 
military in the drug war 
one official involved in the antidrug effort said various 
options will be considered but that reports on such options could 
hurt the effort by giving information to drug operators 
the official who spoke only on condition of anonymity also said 
discussing potential cooperative arrangements with foreign 
governments could be harmful 
the one thing that will make these host governments very 
nervous and less likely to cooperate is if they think something by 
american forces is going to be done to them without their 
knowledge the official said 
bush made his comments during an oval office photo session with 
william bennett whom he has nominated to become director of 
national drug control policy 
bennett said tuesday that theres a lot of discussion going 
on about increased involvement by the military in the past 
bennett has called for such involvement

farmers have once again started to borrow money 
on a large scale a sign the nations longawaited agricultural 
recovery is in full swing an agriculture department report said 
wednesday 
the large paydown in farm debt held by major farm lenders 
appears to be over and debt is expected to grow 15 percent to 35 
percent in 1989 the departments economic research service said 
farm loan demand strengthened in the past year and should continue 
to expand in 1989 
at the height of the recent financial crunch as plummeting land 
values cut sharply into assets thousands of farmers owed so much 
they couldnt qualify for more credit to pay bills 
with the lid on further credit farmers often liquidated or 
culled livestock herds sold commodities held in storage and took 
other steps to reduce debts as this paydown took effect banks and 
other lending institutions have eased back 
as a result the report said creditworthy farmers should have 
ample access to operating credit for spring planting and other 
production expenses this year 
farm lenders are optimistic about financial conditions despite 
the 1988 drought and do not think it will sidetrack the farm 
recovery the report said 
major farm lending groups reported stronger portfolios in 1988 
and fewer farm loan delinquencies loan chargeoffs and 
foreclosures it said an exception was the departments farmers 
home administration which makes loans to the least creditworthy 
producers but indications are that it too is coming to grips 
with its problems the report said 
a major reason for the favorable farm financial outlook this year 
was said to be the continued strength in crop and livestock 
commodity sales 
better economic fundamentals also underlie longrun trends in 
agriculture the report said farmland markets have improved and 
the farm sector balance sheet of assets and liabilities has 
stabilized 
analysts said commodity surpluses are being reduced by last 
years droughtshriveled crop production and strong demand 
the costprice pressures of the early and mid1980s have been 
alleviated the report added but the farm sector will continue 
to depend heavily on government payments and some farms will be 
financially threatened because of the drought

the university of louisville scaled back a 
smoking policy to satisfy lawmakers in this tobaccogrowing state 
who threatened to cut the schools budget 
details of the regulations revised before they were adopted 
were released wednesday 
i believe they are fair and equitable to our faculty staff and 
students said university president donald swain we want to 
create an impression of evenhandedness fairness and balance 
when the first draft was released last fall it was attacked by 
state rep donald gedling chairman of the general asemblys tobacco 
task force 
commenting on the revised version gedlin said i could live 
with that without any problem if its fair to smokers thats what 
we want to look at 
but house agriculture committee chairman clay crupper said he 
wasnt pleased the university had adopted any regulations tuesday 
i didnt think they needed any policy they could do it without 
any regulations he said 
tobacco is a 2 billion industry in kentucky the nations 
leading tobacco grower kentucky had the nations highest 
smokingrelated death rate in 1985 the centers for disease control 
reported in november 
the american lung association of kentucky declined to comment 
wednesday on the revised policy but the groups health education 
director in november said he was embarrassed by legislators 
intervention 
tobacco is such an ingrained part of the social economic and 
political structure of this entire state its hard for people from 
nontobacco states to understand said mike staufacker 
swain said the threepage guideline omits a controversial section 
under which impasses between smokers and nonsmokers would have been 
resolved in favor of nonsmokers the policy now directs department 
heads to discuss and settle conflicts with employees and their 
supervisors 
another change involves open areas in which many people work 
the first draft prohibited smoking in such areas the final 
regulation directs that such areas should be separated into smoking 
and nosmoking areas if practical otherwise the area is to be 
designated smoking or nosmoking by the department head after 
consulting with employees 
as before the regulation prohibits smoking in most common areas 
where people congregate such as halls reception areas and 
auditoriums and in classrooms and laboratories and areas where it 
would be a fire hazard 
it permits smoking in private offices rooms and apartments in 
residence halls and university vehicles unless a nonsmoker in the 
vehicle objects and it directs that smoking and nosmoking areas be 
designated in cafeterias 
spokesmen for faculty staff and students generally said they 
were satisfied with the changes which take effect march 1 
the revision took place largely behind closed doors and swain 
defended that procedure 
we made a conscious effort to keep this from being a news 
item he said the advice i got from all sides was to let the 
dust settle let the emotions subside get the issue out of the 
newspapers and off the television sets then after the issue calmed 
down wed have an atmosphere better for decisionmaking

massachusetts gov michael s dukakis battered 
by political and personal crises since his failed presidential 
campaign met with soontobe democratic party chief ronald brown 
but quickly brushed aside questions about his political future 
right now i want to do everything i can to do the best job i 
can to be governor of massachusetts on a fulltime basis dukakis 
said when asked about a possible presidential run in 1992 weve 
got a lot to do 
questions about dukakis political future followed a private 
meeting he had with brown who is expected to be selected party 
chairman friday by the democratic national committee 
once youre the partys nominee maintaining a national 
political presence is something thats expected of you dukakis 
said but i also know that my first and most important challenge 
is the fiscal problems in massachusetts 
brown a former aide to the rev jesse jackson and sen edward m 
kennedy dmass has faced the same problem that hounded dukakis 
throughout the presidential campaign criticism he is too liberal 
dukakis defended brown saying he would make a fine party 
chairman 
the governor faces severe state budget problems at home and this 
week revealed that his wife kitty was admitted for alcohol abuse 
at a newport ri clinic following a letdown from the presidential 
loss 
asked about the toll an unsuccessful presidential campaign takes 
on a family a subdued dukakis said its about as tough as 
anybody in life has to go through 
massachusetts colleagues indicated that the political and family 
problems are taking their toll on dukakis 
obviously he has his mind in newport rhode island said sen 
john f kerry dmass after the states congressional delegation 
had lunch with dukakis in the office of rep silvio o conte rmass

the national transportation safety board on 
wednesday urged another regulatory agency to change its 
recommendation on the safest way to buckle children in a car 
the boards criticism came in comments on a proposal by the 
national highway traffic safety administration to require rearseat 
lapandshoulder belts in passenger vehicles 
at issue was whether looping the shoulder restraint on a 
lapandshoulder belt over a child leaves the child vulnerable to 
neck injuries in the event of an accident 
the highway administration in proposing the regulation said 
that when a child is buckled in the shoulder portion of the belt 
should be routed behind the child and the child should be 
protected only by the lap belt 
the safety board however said it strongly disagreed 
we know of no evidence that children are endangered by using a 
lapshoulder belt whether it crosses the neck or not ntsb said 
indeed we have cited to the nhtsa several studies demonstrating 
that these systems provide good protection to children 
the use of lapbelts alone places children in danger of serious 
and possibly fatal injury to the abdomen spine and head the safety 
board said 
its response otherwise endorsed the heart of the highway 
administrations proposal which was generally in line with a 1986 
safety board recommendation to manufacturers 
the highway agency rule would require the lapandshoulder 
combination in the two rear window positions in passenger cars 
except convertibles manufactured beginning sept 1 and in 
convertibles light trucks multipurpose vehicles and light buses 
made from sept 1 1991 
regulations presently require lapandshoulder belts in the two 
frontseat positions but require only lapbelts in rear seats 
the national transportation safety board also urged the national 
highway traffic safety administration to consider requiring 
lapandshoulder belts in the center rearseat position but 
recommended against delaying the overall regulation to meet 
technical difficulties with that requirement 
the highway admininstration in its proposed regulation said the 
center lapandshoulder belt would provide small safety benefits 
at substantially greater cost 
the safety board also urged its fellow agency to require 
crashtesting of the rearseat belts particularly because the 
highway administration regulation would allow belt designs that 
critics assert allow excessive slack

the government and electric utilities have 
quietly implemented an antiterrorist program even though weather 
is considered a greater threat to us energy supplies than any 
terrorist group an industry official told congress on wednesday 
michehl r gent president of the north american electric 
reliability council said the program was implemented about six 
months ago but he said skepticism was rampant among planners 
that a multisite terrorist attack ever would be carried out against 
us electric facilities 
gent told the senate governmental affairs committee the program 
involves an ongoing working relationship between the fbi and the 
council which he said represents virtually all us and canadian 
electric suppliers 
he said that because of fear of tipping off terroristsabout the 
plan it was conceived as a quiet program 
quiet means that we have struck a deal with the department of 
energy and the national security council they dont talk about this 
program in public and we dont talk about this program in public 
gent said 
my testimony today is the first and i hope the last public 
utterance of our program gent said adding he would be willing to 
discuss specifics of the program in a closed committee session 
committee chairman john glenn dohio said that could be done 
he noted that oil and natural gas pipeline representatives had cited 
concerns over publicity in declining to testify before the committee 
gent said that despite the concerns about terrorism the us 
electric system is resilient and redundant and natural events such 
as hurricanes could cause more damage than terrorists and weve 
shown we can handle hurricanes 
another witness said there had been 283 documented cases of 
sabotage against american energy systems since 1980 
but robert k mullen a terrorism expert said he saw no evidence 
of an increasing terrorist threat in the united states and that most 
previous acts of sabotage had been incidents such as shooting at 
power lines or arson against gasoline station owners or operators 
there are no indicators of which i am aware that would 
suggest to me the threat to energy assets here is substantially 
different from what the recent historical record indicates mullen 
said 
but gent acknowledged that our concern is not the events that 
were experiencing now but the potential capability thats been 
demonstrated to us by the department of energy 
in earlier testimony the committee was told that the increasing 
hightech nature of the us telecommunications systems and a trend 
towards centralization of facilities was making the networks more 
vulnerable to catastrophic terrorist attack 
the energy department has been advising us companies privately 
of a growing threat of technoterrorism attack on vital domestic 
energy facilities and it is pressing them to fortify their defenses 
the associated press reported this week

the case of a man accused in a string of 
sniper assaults went to the jury wednesday after the defense 
attorney told jurors his client said he was the sniper only to get 
attention 
peter t trepanier was a jokester a prankster and 
prosecutors failed to link him to any of the shootings breakins 
and arsons john j hardiman argued 
trepanier faces six counts of assault with intent to commit 
murder and six counts of conspiracy to commit murder in the string 
of sniping attacks in cumberland and north smithfield in december 
1986 and january 1987 he also is charged with a series of 
burglaries and housefires in burrillville and glocester from april 
to june 1987 trepanier 25 faces a possible life sentence if 
convicted on the arson charges 
prosecuting attorney eva marie mancuso told the 16 jurors that 
the prankster argument was an insult to their intelligence 
the defense wants you to think this was an attentiongetting 
statement said mancuso but she told the jury trepanier had 
told both his friend paula laliberte and police that the gun used 
in the attacks was in a local pond and a gun was actually found 
there 
who picked up the rifle each and every time and looked in the 
scope and pulled the trigger and watched the people fall mancuso 
asked the jury 
trepanier was reckless and reckless is intent to murder she 
said 
the jurors retired to a downtown hotel wednesday afternoon after 
asking to see the exhibits in the case and to have the definition of 
the crime assault with intent to commit murder read back to them 
hardiman spent much time rebutting the statements of laliberte 
who gave detailed testimony about how the defendant confessed to the 
shootings on oct 7 1987 before they both went to woonsocket 
police 
they really are attentiongetters hardiman said of the 
statements he said laliberte had described trepanier as a 
jokester a prankster a kind of guy who would kid around 
hardiman said police had not been able to test the 22caliber 
rifle so they could not link the bullets recovered at the shooting 
scenes directly to the weapon

tobacco should be classified as a drug and 
regulated by the food and drug administration a move that could 
lead to a tobaccofree society by the year 2000 a presidential 
panel said wednesday 
the national cancer advisory board which conducted a series of 
public hearings on cancer prevention also recommended that smoking 
be banned on all airlines and other public transportation and in the 
workplace public buildings and schools 
smokeless tobacco the report said should be banned in schools 
as well and called on professional athletic organization to campaign 
against its use 
congress should pass legislation declaring tobacco to be a drug 
and place it under the control of the fda a move that would help to 
intensify the pressure and activity in america to eliminate 
smoking and tobacco use creating a tobaccofree society by the year 
2000 the report said 
gary miller assistant to the president of the tobacco institute 
said the recommendation by the cancer advisory board was just 
another attempt to create a prohibition of tobacco which he said 
already is one of the most regulated substances in america 
another federal study of tobacco use found that australia has had 
the sharpest decline of smokers when compared with other major 
western industrialized nations including the united states but that 
australias smoking rate among men still remains high 
in a study in the american journal of public health australia 
has had the sharpest drop in smoking since a campaign began in 1983 
with the percentage of smokers among men 20 and older dropping from 
389 to 329 percent 
smoking rates among men in the us great britain canada 
norway and sweden have declined steadily since 1974 and rates are 
lower than australia in the united states canada and sweden 
john pierce chief of the epidemiology branch of the public 
health service said the decline of smokers in australia is 
impressive but that the pacific ocean nation is still playing 
catchup 
the report by the presidential board was based on information 
gathered in public hearings in los angeles atlanta dallas miami 
and philadelphia the study said that a third of all testimony dealt 
entirely or in part with smoking and related subjects and their 
relationship to the prevention of cancer 
as a result the board said its report emphasizes that 
eradication of tobacco use is essential and would have measurable 
results in reducing cancer mortality 
other recommendations from the presidential board included 
increased accessibility and affordability of cancer detection 
procedures particularly for breast cervical and colorectal cancer 
expanded accessibility of cancer prevention information to the 
poor elderly blacks hispanics asianamericans and native 
americans 
expanded involvement of the private sector in cancer prevention 
with work site programs 
expanded cancer education efforts in the media and in 
professional and civic organizations 
encouraging participation of the nations schools in cancer 
prevention and detection 
enhanced involvement of state and local governments in cancer 
prevention and screening and the control of environmental cancer 
risk factors 
the national cancer advisory board was named by president reagan 
as part of the national cancer institutes effort to reduce cancer 
by half among americans by the year 2000

the comments by us officials responded to a call tuesday by 
south african foreign minister pik botha for the united states to 
mediate an end to the 12year civil war in mozambique 
we welcome south africas expression of interest in ending the 
tragic conflict in mozambique that has brought endless suffering and 
death to hundreds of thousands of mozambiquan citizens said state 
department spokesman charles redman 
we encourage the government and people of mozambique to achieve 
a durable peace in their country if that government were to ask us 
to play a role in this regard we would be prepared to give 
thoughtful consideration to exactly how we could be of assistance 
either as mediator or otherwise redman said 
but the united states is uncertain whether bothas proposal 
includes the rebel mozambique national resistance known as renamo 
said another official 
we are seeking clarification on that said e gibson lanpher 
the departments top official for southern africa lanpher also said 
its an open question whether the south african government has 
made that decision of stopping aid to renamo 
south africa helped renamo in the early 1980s but says it stopped 
such aid in 1984 under terms of an agreement with the government 
however the mozambique government continues to accuse south africa 
of aiding renamo 
it is clear that south africas longstanding relations with 
renamo give it the ability to play a constructive role in ending the 
conflict if its prepared to do so redman said 
in testimony wednesday to the house appropriations committees 
subcommittee on foreign operations a refugee organization that 
operates in the region said it was skeptical of south africas 
claims that its support for renamo had ceased 
william frelick of the us committee for refugees a private 
group said renamo is the khmer rouge of africa and mozambique is 
its killing field 
renamo engages in systematic visciousness that puts it in a 
class by itself including mutilations of babies forced labor of 
the elderly looting torture and the killing of more than 100000 
people he said 
a state department human rights report issued this week agrees 
with this assessment but disagrees with human rights groups 
suggestions that the renamo brutality has increased

pope john paul ii urged christians at the 
beginning of lent on wednesday not to fall prey to hypocrisy 
ideologies and worldly fads 
lent a period of fasting and penitence before easter should 
bring a purification of the heart he said in remarks at his 
general audience 
john pauls observation of ash wednesday the opening day of 
lent included an afternoon mass at the fifth century saint sabina 
church on the aventine hill 
the pope said purification of the heart means purification of 
thoughts intentions desires and passions so that our external 
behavior is really sincere and not the fruit of that hypocrisy and 
human glory against which christ was so severe 
the subtle temptation for us christians is that of appearing 
christian without really being so stooping to pacts with ideologies 
and with the fads of this world the pope told several thousand 
pilgrims and tourists in paul vi auditorium 
may this penitential season of lent be for us an occasion for a 
sincere examination of conscience john paul said

the united states has formally notified the 
palestine liberation organization of its serious concern over 
the plos clash with israelis in southern lebanon the state 
department announced wednesday 
robert pelletreau the us ambassador to tunisia registered the 
us view at a meeting in tunis with hakam balloui a plo 
representative department spokesman charles e redman said 
israel has charged five guerrillas from the plo were attempting 
to infiltrate when they were intercepted and slain saturday in a 
security zone israel has established across its border in southern 
lebanon 
accusing the plo of terrorism the israeli government took the 
position the united states should break off its threemonthold 
dialogue with the plo which was based on a renunciation of 
terrorism by chairman yasser arafat 
redman declined to say whether the state department considered 
the incident an act of terrorism or to give details of pelletreaus 
discussion with balloui 
im not going to be able to give a readout on those meetings 
redman said im just going to confirm that ambassador pelletreau 
met with the plos representative in tunis and raised our serious 
concern over the incident in lebanon 
meanwhile israeli ambassador moshe arad called on secretary of 
state james a baker iii and then told reporters we feel this 
whole dialogue was not warranted by the realities and by the 
behavior of the plo and we keep to the same position and the same 
view 
the israeli government takes the position that the clash saturday 
violated arafats renunciation of terrorism 
in our view arad said the actions of the last few weeks 
indicate that they havent changed their character they havent 
changed their involvement in terrorist acts the incident last week 
along the israelilebanese border was just another demonstration of 
their continuous involvement in terrorist acts 
arad declined to say what baker had told him about the us stand 
on the plo but the israeli ambassador said he was pleased with the 
meeting 
diplomatic sources said baker assured the ambassador the united 
states had taken note of the incident and was looking into it the 
sources declining to be identified said baker was noncommittal 
about future us relations with the plo 
the department said tuesday it was investigating the incident and 
that pelletreau had been instructed to take the matter up 
immediately with plo officials 
pelletreau is the designated us contact with the plo which 
makes its headquarters in tunis 
former president reagan broke a 13year ban last december on us 
talks with the plo after arafat made a statement renouncing 
terrorism and recognizing israels right to exist former assistant 
secretary of state richard w murphy and other senior us officials 
cautioned the dialogue would be suspended if the plo violated the 
pledge 
identification carried by four slain palestinians and one 
lebanese involved in the clash saturday indicated they belonged to 
two radical factions of the plo 
redman had reserved judgment tuesday on whether the arafat pledge 
had been violated but he was critical of the plo saying we take 
this incident very seriously it can have a negative impact on the 
usplo dialogue and the atmosphere necessary for a positive 
palestinianisraeli dialogue 
the department has released its annual human rights report to 
congress containing sharp criticism of israels treatment of 
palestinian arabs living on the west bank and in gaza 
several other countries were accused of widespread human rights 
abuses but attention has centered on israel and the reports 
accusations 
the israeli government has denounced the charges as exaggerated 
and unjustified

organized crime will soon control legalized 
gambling on indian reservations if the federal government doesnt 
act a gambling manager for a mob organization told a senate 
subcommittee wednesday 
the secret witness told the panel that organized crime families 
already run 12 of the 90 indian gambling operations that he knows 
about fifty percent of the operations have some link to organized 
crime usually through the purchase of supplies from mafiaowned 
companies he said 
the mans wore a gray hood and testified behind a screen to hide 
his identity in addition his voice was electronically altered 
the indians need help the witness told a special 
investigative panel of the senate select committee on indian 
affairs organized crime is destroying the reservations 
the witness said he managed a bingo operation on a large 
reservation in the western united states for one of the major 
organized crime families 
the witness disputed anthony daniels deputy assistant director 
of the criminal investigation for the fbi who told the panel that 
infiltration of indian gambling by organized crime is still fairly 
limited 
the fbi is wrong the witness said they are not getting 
the right information from whatever source they are getting it 
he said he knew from meetings with organized crime members and 
operators of other indian gaming operations that mob infiltration is 
widespread and growing in 10 years it will be totally out of 
hand 
he said he paid the chief 1000 a week and employed most of the 
chiefs family at the bingo hall but added he didnt think the 
tribe knew he was working for organized the mafia 
the pittstown pabased bufalino family the new york citybased 
lucchese family and the nationwide network set up by the late meyer 
lansky are the organized crime groups which are most heavily 
involved with indian gambling he said 
the witness who said he has 25 years experience in gambling 
operations said organized crime families set up businessmen like 
himself as fronts to manage gaming on the reservations 
great deals of money that should go to the tribe are taken out 
of the bingo hall he said 
he said the mob skimmed at least 600000 to 700000 a year from 
the bingo operation while the tribe received less than 100000 
in mobcontrolled gambling the family usually owned the bingo 
supply company and sold nonexistent or overpriced supplies to the 
reservation he said a mafiaowned construction company would have 
built the bingo hall using overpriced material and labor and would 
operate the food and gift concessions within the building 
games would often be rigged so that an employee of the family won 
prizes worth hundreds of thousands of dollars he said sometimes 
drawings would be held for items such as expensive cars and a crime 
family member or employee would be assured of winning the prize 
mob operations frequently used the bingo games to launder money 
from other illegal businesses such as drug dealing the witness 
said 
he said he also knows that on some reservations organized crime 
families have set up laboratories to manufacture illegal drugs 
although he didnt elaborate 
as bingo manager he earned 2500 a week along with a 
percentage of the money skimmed off the operation and a percentage 
of the profits the witness said 
when the witness was asked what would happen if he tried to run a 
bingo operation separate from the mob he answered this committee 
would be sending flowers to my family 
the bureau of indian affairs is useless in helping the indians 
he said for example when the fbi came to his reservation to 
inquire about the bingo operation he simply told them to get off 
the property and they did 
organized crime families view indian reservations they same way 
they once looked at cuba he said wide open no regulations no 
controls 
the solution he said is that a police force should be formed 
under federal control that could supply the indians with information 
they need about the bingo managers and could go in and look at the 
books 
fbi agent richard james elroy who has been assigned to the 
special senate investigative committee for the last year testified 
that corruption is pervasive among indian tribes in the united 
states but often federal laws are inadequate to prosecute 
wrongdoers 
he acknowledged the sovereignty of indian reservations and the 
restrictions on federal government intervention comparing tribal 
governments to individual states or city governments 
but he said prosecution is more difficult because for some 
reason tribal governments are not included in the code for treatment 
like state governments would be 
as for oversight by the bureau of indian affairs elroy said the 
bia is hamstrung 
he said the relationship between the bia and the tribes is 
intimate he said he knew of three bia directors who were removed 
when tribal leaders told washington they wanted the director out

real cost of telephone service including longdistance dropped 
about 3 percent in 1988 when inflation is taken into consideration 
in 1987 the cost of telephone service also dropped 13 percent 
compared with a 44 percent increase in inflation for a real 
decline of nearly 6 percent 
the figures were reported in the fccs telephone rates update a 
twiceyearly survey of phone costs in 95 cities

4006 per month for local touch tone service including subscriber 
line charges and taxes and 200 short calls in cities where 
unlimited calling was not offered 
the fcc said lowerpriced options for phone service such as 
lifeline and link up were provided in 92 of the 95 cities surveyed

californians awoke wednesday to frosted 
freeways christmas music on the radio and snow falling on such 
unlikely spots as malibu beach as an icy pacific storm chilled out 
commuters and threatened crops 
ive often wondered what would happen if snow fell on our 
freeways and its worse than i thought said veteran traffic 
reporter bill keene of radio station knxam 
other radio stations played christmas songs such as winter 
wonderland and told listeners how to make snowballs and snowmen 
we decided that with snow falling in southern california it 
just felt like the holidays and we dusted off some christmas 
records said mike wagner program director at krlaam in los 
angeles 
the unusual snowfall was the result of a storm that began off the 
california coast running into the frigid air that has settled over 
much of the state in recent days according to the national weather 
service the result was a seasonal storm that brought snow instead 
of rain to several areas 
much of the lower 48 states have dealt with more than a week of 
record cold because of the bitter arctic air that moved in from 
alaska temperatures were beginning to return to normal in some 
areas but recordbreaking cold continued in several cities 
more arctic air moving wednesday across the warmer great lakes 
was producing lakeeffect snow in michigan ohio and new york 
in california snowflakes fell but quickly melted on the streets 
of palm springs and on the sands of malibu residents of the winter 
resorts said the agoura hills and headlands above the beaches at 
malibu kept a coat of snow into the morning icicles hung from the 
chaparral brush of the beach community 
every once in a while the wind blows some flakes down here on 
the beach said bill gould who works at a gas station in malibu 
up to six inches of snow fell in some outlying los angeles 
suburbs closing some roadways and a few schools were shuttered for 
the day snow in the los angeles suburbs is rare but not 
unprecedented 
the city of santa clarita 35 miles northwest of los angeles was 
virtually shut down for the morning 
citrus growers in the center of the state said damage from night 
after night of temperatures in the 20s might run into the tens of 
millions of dollars some flower growers in northern california 
feared their crops were ruined 
the snow brought out surprised residents in their nightclothes 
snowmen shared the front lawns with palm trees and cross country 
skiers were spotted where joggers had been the day before 
wideeyed drivers clung to steering wheels as their cars slid 
over icy patches and children reveled in the white stuff using 
flattened cardboard boxes as makeshift sleds 
i think its very cool said 11yearold laura ruhland of 
santa clarita who awoke before dawn to play in the snow i dont 
think well be going to school today im going to the park to make 
a snowman the trees outside all look like christmas 
san francisco on wednesday had its fifth consecutive morning with 
temperatures 39 degrees or below the first time in history theres 
been such a stretch in february 
californians who took the icy roadway commuter challenge found 
their cars going sideways over the side or not at all there was a 
run on tire chains 
ive sold at least 15 to 20 sets already its crazy said 
chris gardner the assistant manager of chief auto parts in canyon 
country about 30 miles northwest of los angeles 
farmers overnight fired up smudge pots turned on wind machines 
and called in helicopters to protect their crops from frost damage 
threatened were grapes strawberries grapefruit oranges and 
peppers 
southern california citrus avocado and strawberry growers 
escaped crop damage tuesday night because temperatures didnt go low 
enough but there may have been some damage in the san joaquin 
valley said curt anderson of the sunkist growers cooperative 
in san mateo county where a 165 million floral industry serves 
wholesalers along the west coast and the new england states 
agriculture commissioner george ginilo said field flower growers 
suffered a total loss because of the freezing weather blooms 
have withered on the countys primary field crop the marguerite 
daisy he said 
theres gonna be a shortage right now theyre just not 
blooming said mark yamaguchi a growershipper of carnations in 
monterey county

as democrats gathered to elect the first black 
chairman of a major political party they were told wednesday to 
find presidential candidates who are able to speak to the south 
as well as to white protestant voters 
pollster peter hart pointed out to the partys executive 
committee that in the 1988 presidential election republican george 
bush won 155 electoral votes in the south compared to zero for 
democrat michael dukakis 
you cant start out any game behind 155 to 0 and be 
competitive hart said 
hart also said that 48 percent of all voters are white 
protestants 
we have to be able to talk to them he said 
in the 1988 campaign hart said the republicans ran on values 
such as anticrime and prodefense while the democrats ran on 
programs 
weve got to be able to get from programs to values he added 
after two days of preliminary sessions the democratic national 
committee will convene on friday to select ronald h brown as the 
next party chairman 
brown a former aide to sen edward m kennedy and jesse jackson 
is unopposed for the top party job but his impending election was 
raising questions about the help or harm it might bring 
particularly in the south 
will it help asked atlantabased pollster claibourne darden 
the answer is no what can ron brown do to help the democratic 
party bring the liberal vote to it its already there 
bring the black vote to it its already there 
merle black professor of political science at the university of 
north carolina said republicans would use browns election to put 
out the message to southern whites that the democratic party now 
is the party of blacks 
still another analyst of southern politics larry sabato of the 
university of virginia said browns election could cause problems 
for democrats in the region not so much because hes black but 
that hes tied to the twin devils ted kennedy and jesse jackson 
among the democrats two new studies were circulating of 
political trends in the region that was once the party most 
reliable base 
one looked at 1988 presidential election returns in seven 
southern states and disclosed that republican george bush 
consistently beat democrat michael dukakis in the regions fastest 
growing and most affluent counties 
bush swept the deep south on nov 8 dukakis best showing was in 
louisiana where he trailed with 45 percent of the vote he received 
40 percent or less in alabama florida georgia mississippi south 
carolina and virginia 
the second study focused on alabama and urged the state 
democratic party there to turn its attention toward gaining a 
greater understanding of why it has failed to capture significant 
support within alabamas white voting population 
written by pollster and dnc member natalie davis the study 
concluded that in alabama the democratic party has been a 
nogrowth party 
concern over the partys dwindling appeal among white voters in 
the south became an issue in the campaign for party chairman 
however brown overcame four rivals in the contest to succeed paul 
g kirk jr 
with the exception of 1976 when georgian jimmy carter was the 
democratic presidential nominee republicans have carried the south 
in recent national elections 
when carter ran for reelection against ronald reagan in 1980 
the democratic incumbents southern base shrank to his home state 
walter f mondale was shut out in the south four years later 
in its study of 1988 election returns in seven southern states 
the institute for southern studies found that the counties carried 
by bush were richer whiter and growing nearly twice as fast as 
the counties carried by dukakis 
in addition the analysis determined that bush was strongest in 
areas with the highest voter turnout 
the numbers show that the democratic ticket in november just 
didnt excite voters the way the republican ticket did said bob 
hall research director of the institute 
ms davis said her analysis of the 1988 returns in alabama 
indicated that dukakis received between 25 and 30 percent of the 
white vote there which actually was an improvement over mondales 
showing of about 20 percent 
she said her polling found that in 1981 51 percent of white 
voters in alabama identified themselves as democrats and 32 percent 
as republicans her latest survey taken in october 1988 found those 
numbers reversed with 52 percent calling themselves republicans and 
33 percent democrats 
she said that while many voters reject the democratic party 
because it has black support there are other factors which argue 
against so simplistic an analysis 
darden said the identification of the democrats as the party of 
blacks was growing in the south 
one thing we dont need in the south or in this country he 
said is the democratic party to be a black party and the 
republican party to be a white party that doesnt help anybody and 
its an unreversable role right now in the south 
what could change that is if the republicans succeed in 
attracting black votes an avowed goal of the new gop chairman lee 
atwater 
then said darden we can get back to the politics of class 
where voters are influenced most by economic arguments

the securities and exchange commission on 
wednesday proposed new rules that would crack down on stockbrokers 
who use highpressure telephone tactics to sell penny stocks 
the stocks typically sell for less than 3 a share some are 
issued by legitimate companies but many are sold by companies with 
an erratic earnings history 
the stocks can be thinly traded and it is often difficult for an 
investor to accurately judge their value brokers sometimes take 
extralarge commissions on penny stock sales 
the sec rule proposed by a 50 vote would not entirely ban 
unsolicited cold calls however it would require brokerage 
firms to sign a written agreement with a new customer before 
completing a transaction 
brokers would also have to interview new customers to determine 
if they were suitable for risky investments and keep the suitability 
documents on file for inspection by regulators 
final action could come in 30 to 60 days after the agency reviews 
public comment 
the president of a group representing state regulators the north 
american securities administrators association praised the proposal 
as a meaningful effort to provide frontend protection against 
some of the worst abuses and fraud in the penny stock market 
the commission is signaling to the industry and the little guy 
that it intends to proceed in a very serious fashion said john 
baldwin president of the association and director of the utah 
securities division 
the sec has identified six areas where penny stock fraud is 
prevalent south florida new jersey nevada los angeles denver 
and utah 
last october sec chairman david s ruder established a task 
force on penny stock manipulation according to the agencys staff 
about 325 brokerage firms sell penny stocks up from 55 a few years 
ago 
the proposed rules apply to socalled pink sheet stocks 
issued by companies with fewer than 300000 in assets the pink 
sheets are published by the national quotation bureau inc a 
private firm 
stocks traded on exchanges or through the automated system of the 
national association of securities dealers would be exempt from the 
rule also brokers could sell to large institutional investors 
without meeting the stricter requirements for individual investors

investigation that also led to the resignation of another man on the 
threemember commission 
former southern district highway commissioner bob joiner 59 was 
sentenced to six years in prison on the federal extortion charge and 
received a fiveyear suspended sentence on a tax evasion count 
us district judge tom s lee told joiner a presentencing 
report showed you blatantly solicited kickbacks from contractors 
and that the only redeeming factor in your behalf is that you have 
cooperated with the prosecutor

federal counts following a federal probe with cooperation from 
thenstate auditor ray mabus whose office had been investigating 
the state highway department since 1985

contractors and of underestimating his income tax from 198184

led to a filing of court documents in december implicating 
thencentral district highway commissioner sam waggoner he resigned 
later in the month

monday but his court appearance was delayed because of an ice storm

the governing national partys new 
leader fw de klerk said wednesday he is committed both to equal 
rights for blacks and to whitesonly communities 
foreign minister rf botha said criticism of south africas 
human rights record by the us state department was onesided and 
unsubstantiated 
de klerk told parliament in his first major address since being 
chosen as party chief last week the government must develop a 
constitution that protects the rights of both whites and blacks 
i want to state unequivocally that the national party is 
against domination of any one group by others he said white 
domination in so far as it still exists must go 
he also said the government remains committed to segregated 
neighborhoods schools and other facilities under the principle of 
group rights 
a strong emphasis on group rights alongside individual rights 
is based on the reality of south africa and not on an ideological 
obsession or racial prejudice he said 
under south africas apartheid policy of racial segregation the 
5 million whites maintain political and economic control over the 
countrys 26 million blacks who have no vote in national affairs 
at a briefing for foreign journalists after the parliament 
speech de klerk declared support for gradual and limited race 
reforms 
the crux of what i wanted to get across was to commit the 
national party to the very same road which president pw botha 
has taken the party on he said 
he visited botha at his cape town residence wednesday but would 
not give details of the meeting 
botha relinquished the party leadership after suffering a stroke 
and de klerk 52 was chosen feb 2 to succeed him the national 
party has governed south africa since 1948 and made apartheid into 
law 
the president has indicated he will resume official duties when 
he recovers de klerk is considered heir apparent chris heunis the 
constitutional development minister now is acting president 
de klerk is seen as a cautious pragmatist who supports gradual 
expansion of black rights while keeping real political power in 
white hands although he said wednesday the government is ready to 
negotiate a new constitution with blacks few black leaders agree to 
talk without further reforms 
pressure on the right comes from the conservative party which 
sees bothas limited reforms as capitulation to the black majority 
foreign minister botha no relation to the president said the 
state department ignores the government obligation to maintain law 
and order against terrorism in south africa while at the same time 
it is silent on the acts of terrorism perpetrated by the anc the 
african national congress guerrilla movement 
in its annual report on the state of human rights around the 
world released tuesday the state department said south africa 
further curtailed rights last year by clamping down on opponents of 
the government and banning peaceful antiapartheid groups

president bush said wednesday he wants to 
develop a consensus among industry and environmental interests in an 
effort to find ways to clean up the environment without stifling 
the economy 
americans are impatient for results on environmental cleanup 
bush said at swearingin ceremonies for interior secretary manuel 
lujan jr and environmental protection agency administrator william 
k reilly the two top officials who will guide his administrations 
environmental efforts 
they wont accept excuses anymore and they wont accept 
fingerpointing they want us to get all the sides together and find 
a way to achieve both their goals he told a gathering at epa 
headquarters where reilly was sworn in 
his comments came the day before his address to congress in which 
he will deliver budget proposals on his spending priorities on the 
environment as well as other matters 
bushs visit to epa was the first by a president since the agency 
was created in 1970 reilly noted this when he made his remarks 
following his swearing in 
you are not dreaming this is the president of the united 
states said the former head of the conservation foundation and of 
the us affiliate of the world wildlife fund 
he said bush came because he cares urgently about protecting 
the environment 
isnt it encouraging to have an environmentalist in the white 
house who comes here to signal his close and public commitment to 
the work of the environmental protection agency he said 
bush said he wants to build a consensus among environmental and 
industry interests to ensure a clean environment 
i believe doing that requires finding ways to clean up the 
environment without stifling the economy he said more often 
than not there is common ground if the parties will make an effort 
to find it he added 
bush said americans want both economic growth and a clean 
environment 
at the interior department bush said that lujan a former 
congressman from new mexico agreed with him in sharing the 
sentiments of former president theodore roosevelt who said a 
grove of giant redwoods or sequoias should be kept just as we keep a 
great and beautiful cathedral 
bush called for conservation and wise management of public 
land 
during last years presidential campaign bush promised to deal 
aggressively with such issues as global warming toxic waste 
disposal and acid rain 
reilly said public demand for a clean environment has probably 
never been firmer

jan timman of the netherlands defeated 
lajos portisch of hungary in the final game of their world chess 
championship candidates quarterfinal wednesday to win the sixgame 
match 3525 
it was the second consecutive victory in the hardfought contest 
for the 37yearold dutchman who had luck on his side just as in 
the previous game when he tied the match 
in wednesdays encounter he was never in danger of defeat but 
chess experts said a draw was the most he should have gained 
portisch played black in the taimanov variation of the sicilian 
defense and was clearly aiming for a peaceful outcome which would 
have caused the match to go into overtime 
he sacrificed a pawn and exchanged queens early on simplifying 
the position until the two sides were almost completely evened out 
timman had only a virtually worthless extra pawn and a slight 
spatial advantage to fight on with 
but fight on he did taking risks that made dutch grandmaster 
genna sosonko say he might lose the game and with it the match 
if he goes on like this 
it turned out to be part of timmans strategy 
just as in the previous game it was my aim to terrorize my 
opponent by doing the unexpected hollands strongest chess player 
said afterwards 
unable to stand the strain portisch nervously sought to create 
counter chances experts said he should have resigned himself to a 
passive defense 
about 50 moves into the rooks and bishops endgame the hungarian 
made the decisive mistake allowing a white pawn advance on the 
queenside 
timman quickly concentrated his forces to support the lonely pawn 
and coasted to final victory on his 64th when portisch resigned 
under the thunderous applause of the 200 spectators packing the 
tournament hall 
the victory earned timman a berth in the semifinals to be played 
in october in london 
he will play britains jonathan speelman while former world 
champion anatoly karpov takes on fellow soviet grandmaster artur 
yusupov in the other semifinal match 
the winner of the final whose date and venue remain to be 
chosen gains the right to challenge world champion gary kasparov of 
the soviet union 
portisch meanwhile announced his withdrawal from the world 
championship race 
he said he would continue to play tournament chess but said that 
at 51 and having competed in the candidates series eight times 
since 1964 enough is enough

a strike at the nations largest power 
plant picked up strength wednesday drawing a sharp government 
rebuke that it could mar the atmosphere at continuing talks with the 
banned solidarity trade union 
the coal mine at the belchatow power complex 90 miles southwest 
of warsaw was shut down wednesday with the widening of a partial 
work stoppage that started monday state television and solidarity 
reported 
the shutdown came the same day that a working group of about 40 
solidarity and government representatives met in warsaw on reaching 
a consensus on the nations economic problems the meeting was part 
of broader talks that began monday 
the power plant produces 20 percent of polands energy according 
to a strike committee spokesman and was burning its threeday 
reserve of coal 
state tv said 4000 workers were on strike while the solidarity 
information service in warsaw put the number at 8000 the complex 
employs 12500 workers 
the dispute involves implementation of previously negotiated pay 
raises said edward olszewski of the strike committee he said one 
management offer was rejected wednesday and the situation is very 
tense because of the threat to power supplies for central poland 
the workers led by local solidarity activists seek a monthly 
pay increase of about 59 the official average wage is about 145 a 
month but the strike committee spokesman said the rate is skewed by 
the higher salaries of managers and few workers receive that much 
the publicly owned complex is part of a coalandpower monopoly 
formed last year in a government restructuring that removed some 
industry from direct state control the government has warned 
against enterprises paying wages that exceed their financial 
earnings with raises pegged to higher productivity 
solidarity leader lech walesa sent an envoy to see the strikers 
but government spokesman jerzy urban accused the envoy coal miner 
alojzy pietrzyk of endorsing and encouraging the strike at a rally 
attended by thousands of workers rather than trying to ease it 
i must express decisive anxiety for the sense of the round 
table talks and chances for agreement agreement is not posible 
under strike pressure urban said 
the present partners at the round table linking themselves to 
solidarity traditions sat at the table for seeking agreement 
rejecting confrontation methods how then should one assess that a 
participant referring to lech walesa warms up the workers to 
strike urban told state media 
signs of labor tension appeared elsewhere workers at the coke 
department of the strikeprone nowa huta steel mill near krakow have 
been refusing since feb 1 to work overtime solidarity spokesmen 
reported 
at another power plant the dolna odra near szczecin members of 
the official trade union told officials they are protesting their 
pay but no strike was declared according to the staterun pap news 
service 
solidarity spokesman wojciech maziarski said he had no 
information about the dolna ordra situation and that the union was 
seeking information from pietrzyk in order to reply to urbans 
accusations 
the strike has put both sides in the talks in a delicate 
position since communist party officials entered the negotiations 
despite internal opposition from hardliners arguing that an 
agreement with solidarity would help keep labor peace 
earlier wednesday the government and opposition representatives 
held the first meeting of a working group on the economy 
participants looked at economic and social issues seeking a 
consensus to reverse the stagnation inflation and shortages that 
have sapped polands progress they agreed to meet again monday 
the debates today were considered by our side as interesting 
and promising said government spokesman zbyslaw rakowski among 
the issues raised were priceandincomes policy rationing of meat 
the crushing foreign debt and spending on the military he said 
a government plan on consolidating the economy was proposed by 
authorities as a starting point for the talks but officials said 
they remain open to proposals rykowski said 
opposition spokesmen said they emphasized the need for the public 
to have a voice in curbing unwise economic decisions by authorities 
we think that all basic decisions in the system of managing the 
economy and in economic policy should be under societys control 
said witold trzeciakowski an economist who led the opposition 
delegation 
two other working groups on trade unions and political freedoms 
will meet this week all part of the historic talks that have 
brought together leaders from the communist party the opposition 
and the roman catholic church 
a chief goal of the negotiations expected to last up to six 
weeks is the legalization of solidarity the east blocs first 
independent trade union outlawed in 1982 after a martiallaw 
crackdown other reforms also are on the table including opposition 
participation in the communistcontrolled parliament 
neither walesa nor interior minister czeslaw kiszczak were at the 
talks wednesday wladyslaw baka the ruling politburo member 
responsible for the economy and witold trzeciakowski an economist 
on a citizens committee formed by walesa were the senior 
participants

wednesday that it is temporarily halting sampl rescues 
sampl regulators rescued or propped up 223 institutions last year

losses the deals have been criticized as more expensive to tax 
payers in the long run 
the fdic a commercial bank regulator will spend the next month 
taking control of the remaining failed sampls under orders from 
president bush in a statement wednesday the fdic said it was 
calling a halt to assistance transactions until it can evaluate the

the government said it shelved secret 
research on a shortrange conventional missile on wednesday a day 
after a televised report that the rocket could also carry nuclear 
warheads 
west germanys chief government spokesman friedhelm ost 
repeated official denials that the proposed missile researched by a 
us and a west german company had nuclear potential 
ost said shelving the technex project was in response to 
recent positive signals in disarmament efforts including 
planned troop reductions by the warsaw pact and agreement to begin 
eastwest conventional weapons talks in march 
but he said the research could resume if the talks are 
unsuccessful 
the governments move also appeared aimed at heading off any 
anger among west germans after tuesdays disclosure of the technex 
research project and a claim by the ard television network that the 
weapons system could carry a nuclear warhead 
because of a popular perception that the east bloc is no longer a 
military threat there is a growing antimilitary mood in west 
germany that has led to widespread opposition against any move that 
could torpedo disarmament efforts and good relations with the east 
bloc 
east germanys official communist party newspaper lashed out at 
its western neighbor over the weapons research 
the newspaper neues deutschland said any government doing such 
research is not seriously interested in seeing success at the 
upcoming vienna conventional weapons talks 
these parties are at the most using these talks to cover up 
major disarmament projects the newspaper said in a commentary 
ost told reporters that chancellor helmut kohl and defense 
minister rupert scholz made the decision to shelve the technex 
project following long talks 
but both agree that this option should only be completely 
abandoned if the conventional weapons talks result in a conventional 
balance at a reduced level he added 
nato maintains that the warsaw pact maintains a strong military 
superiority in a number of areas 
defense ministry spokesman winfried dunkel on wednesday said the 
us rocket manufacturer martin marietta and 
messerschmittboelkowblohm a west german aerospace company 
participated in the 546 million study 
he said the two firms were researching the feasibility of a 
rocket system with a range of up to 310 miles fitted with a special 
conventional warhead to destroy enemy air bases in times of war 
udo philipp a messerschmidt spokesman said the rocket would not 
be able to carry a nuclear warhead 
because of factors of weight aerodynamics and size the 
warheads would not be interchangeable he said 
but ard on tuesday reported it obtained defense ministry 
documents showing the weapon would have dual capability 
dunkel did not specify what the technex research achieved but 
said it was only a technical study that no prototype was built 
and no companies were contracted to produce it 
dunkel rejected claims by some opposition party members that they 
were kept in the dark about the technex project saying the 
parliamentary defense committee had known about it since june 1987

the judge in oliver norths trial on wednesday 
denied a justice department demand for more stringent controls over 
any state secrets the former national security council aide might 
try to use in his defense 
before he ruled us district judge gerhard gesell invited the 
justice department to take its demand to the us court of appeals 
david runkel a justice department spokesman said after the gesell 
ruling that the decision would be appealed 
earlier in the day the department brought norths irancontra 
trial to a temporary halt by demanding a court order that north 
disclose no classified information in any form except with the 
approval of the court and the justice department 
gesell was angry over the delay on the eve of opening arguments 
and said jury selection would resume thursday 
i want to do my level best to protect the national secrets of 
this country gesell told deputy assistant attorney general 
stephen a saltzburg i want to do even more to give this man a 
fair trial this is not a trial of national security its a trial 
of oliver north 
at issue is a jan 19 order in which gesell outlined what 
classified information north will be allowed to present in his 
defense in open court 
us intelligence agencies have indicated worry that portions of 
the order are too broad and would allow north to introduce secrets 
that could harm national security 
you cant ride this horse in both directions the judge said 
you can either move to protect national security or you can move 
to a fair trial congress says that if push comes to shove a trial 
judge has one option to move toward a fair trial 
the justice department said in a motion filed wednesday that 
north a former national security council aide has made no effort 
to assist the court in dealing responsibly with classified 
information 
the department said north has provided totally useless or at 
best minimally informative notices of the documents he wants to 
disclose 
when the matter came up gesell had just finished qualifying 35 
women and 10 men to be on the panel from which the jury will be 
chosen he sent the prospective jurors home and held an afternoon 
hearing in the unusual situation that confronted him the justice 
department stepping into an area the independent counsel previously 
had handled 
for a month i asked the attorney general to these hearings and 
he never came gesell told saltzburg now you come to the 
conclusion that we start at square one all over 
specifically the department asked gesell to forbid north 
disclose any classified information to which it had any objection 
the proposed order would also say that gesell must rule any 
classified information was relevant and admissible before it could 
be brought before the jury 
in court the judge said he wasnt going to tolerate a cuckoo 
clock trial which would be constantly interrupted with reviews of 
classified material before it is introduced in the courtroom 
we have no wish to impose a cuckoo clock trial responded 
saltzburg we have an obligation to protect classified material 
that could harm national security and there is some information 
that cannot be put back in a bottle he said having jurors sit 
through such interminable delays is not a trial that is a farce 
independent counsel lawrence walsh opposed the justice department 
request telling the judge were ready to go to trial and we 
dont want delays he said he trusted north attorney brendan 
sullivan not to trick or trap this court at the expense of 
national security 
the department said in its written motion that at this stage 
the united states faces a trial at which important classified 
information is at risk there is every reason to believe that 
irrelevant or immaterial classified information might be revealed 
during the trial 
the case of north a former marine lieutenant colonel attached to 
the national security council who is charged with 12 criminal counts 
stemming from the irancontra affair is being prosecuted not by the 
justice department but by lawyers who work for walsh 
the argument is only the latest in a long legal trail over the 
secrets north says he must disclose to adequately defend himself 
against charges that he concealed from congress his efforts on 
behalf of the nicaraguan contras and of covering up from the 
attorney general the national security councils role in diverting 
money from the iran arms sales to the contras 
two major charges conspiracy and theft were dropped last month 
after the reagan administration said it could not declassify 
documents that gesell had ruled would be needed for north to get a 
fair trial on those counts 
the department said in its motion that gesell has issued only 
general guidance on the relevance and admissibility of secret 
information so the parties are left to their own devices to 
determine in opening statements direct examination and 
crossexamination as to what classified information to mention 
it also said the 1980 classified information procedures act set 
guidelines to permit prosecutions to go forward but the 
procedures adopted by the court fail to implement the most 
important features of cipa he said additional procedures are 
required 
gesell disclosed in court that he had been holding a request from 
norths lawyers not to apply that law in the case waiting for 
developments now he said if the appeals court goes along with the 
justice department my strong inclination would be not to apply 
cipa at all 
under the act the attorney general may file an affidavit 
objecting to disclosure of classified material and the court must 
then order that the defendant not disclose the information 
the judge said he was a layman in national security matters and 
would leave decisions on what would breach security to the 
government 
im going to stay out of your turf but i am not ready to let 
you run mine he told saltzburg im going to have a fair trial 
or we wont have a trial

the central bank tightened control over 
withdrawals by some government agencies wednesday apparently to 
recover funds diverted before the ouster of president alfredo 
stroessner 
stroessner toppled last week in a military coup led by gen 
andres rodriguez was accused tuesday of personally controlling at 
least two accounts funded by public money 
the central bank paraguays equivalent of the us federal 
reserve board said the reason for the measure was to obtain 
better control and greater clarification of the destination and 
correct application of public funds 
it said the action could cause delays in the payment of some 
government checks but that the withdrawal control would last a 
short time it did not elaborate 
in separate developments the exdirector of the post office 
manuel esquivel shot and wounded himself in the head in an apparent 
suicide attempt after the new government announced an investigation 
of the post office newspapers reported wednesday 
education minister dionisio gonzalez torres said teachers no 
longer will be required to be members of the ruling colorado party 
as a condition of employment during the nearly 35year stroessner 
regime which came to an end friday all public employees were 
required to belong to the party 
stroessner 76 reportedly ailing was sent sunday into exile in 
neighboring brazil 
gen juan antonio caceres minister of public works and 
communications until rodriguez took over as provisional president 
and fired the cabinet said tuesday that stroesner had personal 
signature power over two accounts totaling more than 4 million the 
money came from highway tolls and gasoline taxes 
caceres said he didnt know what stroessner used the money for 
but he said the funds generally were not available for use by his 
ministry 
charges of personal corruption under stroesser during his nearly 
35 years in power were widespread opposition politicians 
persecuted under stroessner but now allowed to speak freely have 
called for the creation of a special commission to recover 
government money that was misallocated under the old regime 
aldo zuccolillo publisher of the newspaper abc color closed by 
stroessner but now prepared to reopen supported the central bank 
action 
this was taxpayers money being administered as though it were 
a personal checking account zuccolillo said in an interview 
there must be dozens more accounts like this linked to other 
government ministries in staterun companies 
the publisher said he had no proof that such was the case but 
expected the central bank review of withdrawals will reveal some 
in other developments attorney pedro abilio rolon has filed a 
citizens suit with the supreme court against three exgovernment 
ministers and stroessners longtime personal secretary mario abdo 
benitez 
the suit filed monday accused the four of using public funds and 
accepting bribes to obtain mansions apartments and autos worth 
much more than they could afford on public salaries and sought to 
embargo their local bank accounts 
benitez is under arrest among the three others exinterior 
minister sabino montanaro was given a safe conduct out of the 
country exjustice minister eugenio jacquet and expublic health 
minister adan godoy jimenez were believed to be out of the country

senators said wednesday a first vote on john 
towers nomination as defense secretary will be delayed nearly two 
weeks while the fbi reviews allegations about his finances and 
drinking but president bush stood by him denouncing rumor and 
frenzied speculation 
there are new allegations of a financial nature which are now 
being checked in the tower nomination said sen sam nunn dga 
the armed services committee chairman he told reporters he could 
not vote to confirm tower until the latest charges were checked and 
said he had told bush that 
sen john mccain rariz said new allegations linked tower to 
the pentagon procurement investigation which has involved payments 
by defense contractors for classified information regarding 
lucrative military contracts 
it has to do with this procurement scandal the ill wind 
thing said mccain using the justice department name for the 
investigation i have no independent knowledge but i am 
confident that is the case 
an administration official said the fbi background inquiry 
focused on contributions to one of towers senate campaigns by a 
contractor now under investigation in the pentagon procurement fraud 
investigation 
but the official speaking on condition of anonymity emphasized 
that the fbi had found no evidence of illegal wrongdoing by tower 
and noted that politicians cant control who gives money to their 
campaigns 
tower has denied trading secrets for cash but nunn and other 
senators have voiced concern whether tower could avoid conflicts of 
interests in view of the more than 1 million he received as a 
consultant for major defense contractors after ending a 24year 
career in the senate four years ago 
bush told reporters at the white house he had seen no evidence 
causing him to lose confidence in his nominee 
have i seen anything or has anything in the fbi report made me 
want to change my mind as one who would be concerned about 
insobriety or about failure to be ready for duty 24 hours a day the 
answer is no i have not 
if somebody has something other than rumor and frenzied 
speculation please get it to the fbi or get it to the white house 
staff or certainly get it to the committee in the senate but let 
us be fair enough that we do not deal in rumor after rumor bush 
said 
meanwhile white house counsel and chief ethics adviser c boyden 
gray presented the fbi report to nunn and sen john warner of 
virginia the senate panels ranking republican the white house 
said it was standard practice for the white house counsels 
office to carry such reports to the hill 
but it also appeared to be a move to appease nunn who on tuesday 
had expressed irritation that the white house had briefed committee 
republicans and not him 
nunn and warner met on capitol hill with gray for two hours to 
review the investigation into towers private life 
gray told them a separate investigation into towers financial 
dealings would take another 10 days to complete nunn said 
after the meeting nunn and warner met with tower in nunns 
office for 90 minutes tower left without speaking with reporters 
nunn and warner described it as a good meeting but declined 
further comment 
the administration had been pushing for a vote this week but 
dropped that after nunn and warner met with bush on tuesday 
i told the president frankly that i have serious concerns and 
i also stated that if a vote was held immediately as some have 
urged i would vote no because of these concerns nunn told 
reporters the secondranking democrat on the committee sen james 
exon of nebraska also said he could not vote in favor of tower 
until the fbi completes its investigation 
the senate majority leader george mitchell of maine said that 
all members of that body wanted to thoroughly review an armed 
services committee report on the investigation and therefore i 
dont see how it is possible to bring the matter to a vote this 
week 
the senate begins a weeklong recess friday and the committee 
must act on the nomination before it even reaches the full senate 
both mccain and exon said the committee could not vote by friday 
at the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the 
main new allegation relates to senator towers activities while he 
was in the senate 
they really cant vote until this matter is checked out he 
said 
senate republicans generally defended the nominee 
their leader sen bob dole of kansas said he spoke with tower 
on the telephone wednesday morning and found him upbeat about the 
nomination 
he is aware of the new allegation said dole adding that 
tower thinks his nomination should be confirmed and is hanging in 
there 
a republican on the committee william cohen of maine said 
democrats should not allow the tower nomination to turn into a 
partisan wrangle 
committee members had hoped to vote last week but postponed it 
because of renewed allegations of heavy drinking and womanizing 
nunn said the committee had not received the fbi report on those 
matters although the white house orally briefed the panels 
republicans on them tuesday 
another matter also cropped up 
two fbi agents were reviewing documents obtained by rep john 
dingell dmich pertaining to alleged security violations at the 
arms control delegation office in geneva switzerland according to 
a congressional source tower was the chief arms control negotiator 
in geneva in 19851986 
the source said dingell chairman of the house energy and 
commerce committee contacted the fbi about the state department 
documents the agents followed up dingells offer on wednesday 
nunn cautioned reporters to be very cautious on that issue 
and added we have found nothing to corroborate any security 
violations by senator tower in geneva 
nunn asked by reporters whether towers alcohol consumption was 
his chief concern said 
i dont want to categorize it like that thats one of my 
primary concerns the question there is whether there has been an 
alcohol abuse problem if there has been a problem in the past is 
there a point where it has been recognized by the nominee and dealt 
with effectively that is to say is it a continuing problem i do 
not have an answer to that yet 
tower visited the white house for a regularly scheduled breakfast 
with secretary of state james a baker iii and national security 
adviser brent scowcroft said fitzwater bush did not attend

the white house has been guilty of confusion 
and incompetence in some of its handling of the troubled 
nomination of john tower as secretary of defense president bushs 
spokesman said wednesday 
the unusually candid admission came as new allegations were 
raised about tower in addition to earlier reports of womanizing and 
excessive drinking on capitol hill a confirmation vote on towers 
nomination was pushed back at least 10 days as lawmakers said they 
were examining reports about towers finances 
bush himself said he may have contributed to the controversy 
about tower by holding a news conference where new allegations were 
raised this frenzied air of speculation doesnt help anybody 
bush said it doesnt help national security or our country it 
doesnt help sen tower 
the president making an exception to his rule of not answering 
questions during phototaking sessions gave a ringing defense of 
tower praising the integrity and honor of a decent man 
bush said theres always some other allegation about tower 
to my knowledge each one of them has been reviewed and shot down 
in flames so whats fair whats fair in the american process 
thats the question i would rhetorically ask in defense of my 
nominee 
meanwhile marlin fitzwater the presidents press secretary 
said the white house had erred in failing to give congress a file 
requested weeks ago in connection with towers nomination 
the document from the office of personnel management deals with 
an air force investigation of security violations at the arms 
control agency in geneva said rep john dingell dmich tower was 
an arms negotiator in geneva in geneva in 1985 and 1986 
it should have been given to them right off the bat and it was 
not fitzwater said asked why it was withheld he said i dont 
have a good reason really other than at first they didnt think it 
existed then they thought there was only part of it that was 
there i think it was just bad communication and just mishandling 
frankly in the first days of the administration 
pressed on the matter fitzwater said i dont have any answer 
as near as i can tell it was just confusion and incompetence not 
conspiracy 
moreover fitzwater acknowledged the white house had blundered by 
excluding sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services 
committee from a capitol hill briefing tuesday about what the fbi 
had learned in its investigation of tower the meeting was attended 
only by republicans 
i dont know why it was decided to do it that way yesterday 
morning fitzwater said obviously i dont believe wed do it 
that way again 
nunn an influential lawmaker on issues of national security did 
not hide his unhappiness about being excluded 
fitzwater also acknowledged that as the white house spokesman he 
had been kept in the dark about nunn telling bush at a meeting 
tuesday night that nunn could not vote for tower if he had to vote 
immediately 
fitzwater had told reporters tuesday night that nunn had not 
expressed concerns about tower during the session with the 
president i wasnt in the meeting andi think theres room for 
debate over how you interpret concern fitzwater said 
the press secretary said white house chief of staff john sununu 
had been in the meeting and was my source 
on capitol hill sen james exon of nebraska the secondranking 
democrat on the armed services committee expressed irritation about 
the way white house counsel c boyden gray was providing information 
to congress 
several of us in the senate have decided that we do not want 
sanitized versions of the fbi report passed to us through anybody at 
the white house exon said 
rightly or wrongly a process has developed where we heard of 
charges we would funnel those to the white house they would funnel 
that to the fbi they would come back to us exon said we 
decided that we did not need the white house as an intervening 
interpreter either asking the questions or giving us their 
impression of the fbi report 
i happen to feel exon said that the president has not 
been adequately advised on this matter by his subordinates at the 
white house 
sen carl levin dmich said grays handling of documents about 
tower raises questions about the white house counsels commitment 
to discovering and sharing with the senate all the facts which are 
relevant to this confirmation process

the husband of a pregnant comatose woman pleaded 
with a state appeals court wednesday to allow him to end his wifes 
pregnancy in hopes of helping her recover 
martin klein was granted guardianship of his wife tuesday so he 
could authorize an abortion but two antiabortion activists 
appealed the ruling 
i implore this court not to permit these two strangers to delay 
my decision klein said in an affidavit submitted to the appeals 
court prior to wednesdays hearing 
for nine years my wife and i have lived a happy and devoted 
life together he continued i know her wishes and priorities 
including her own survival and recovery in view of the welfare of 
our 3yearold daughter 
the fivejudge appeals panel is expected to rule by friday 
nancy klein who is about 17 weeks pregnant has been in a coma 
at north shore university hospital in manhasset since a dec 13 car 
accident doctors have told her husband an abortion could aid in her 
recovery 
klein sought guardianship when hospital officials said they would 
not perform an abortion unless he became his wifes legal guardian 
i just want to get this issue behind us theyre ripping my 
guts out said an anguished klein before heading into the court 
hearing 
the antiabortion activists john short of farmingdale and john 
broderick of syosset succeeded in blocking the guardianship ruling

will be a newborn alive child said short founder of the long

lives she will have an extension of herself in the baby 
kleins attorney sidney schutz argued that short and broderick 
were intruders strangers with no right to decide mrs kleins 
fate mary spaulding shorts attorney said it was a conflict of 
interest for klein to be named guardian 
in an interview with the associated press before wednesdays 
hearing klein said he knows better what choice his wife would make 
than the strangers trying to usurp his guardianship 
everyone has a right to their beliefs but why dont they ever

tells her about friends who have called i tell her about our 
daughter and just generally about how my day went 
he said hes not sure if his wife can understand him and added 
im just taking one day at a time inside im tearing up but im 
trying to keep a smile on my face hopefully everything will work

a father poured gasoline over himself and 
his two children then set them ablaze according to investigators 
who found all three bodies in the mans locked truck 
i certainly think it was deliberately set said deputy george 
mckay an arson investigator for the rankin county sheriffs 
department someone poured the gasoline on them i would have 
to say the adult poured the gasoline 
mckay said investigators also were looking into the possibility 
that the children were slain before the father pulled into the 
parking lot of womans hospital in flowood where his exwife was 
working 
i dont know anybodys children who wouldnt scream and holler 
if someone was rendering these children helpless someone would 
have heard them scream there are people in this parking lot all the 
time and on the road he said we feel they had met their demise 
before they ever came to this parking lot 
lt johnny watkins a criminal investigator with the flowood 
police department said the exwife reported the couple hadnt been 
arguing 
they had spoken earlier in the day but there was nothing 
indicating what was ahead watkins said he was not violent on 
the phone and there was nothing out of the ordinary 
county coroner jimmy roberts identified the dead as 29yearold 
benny bilbrew his son benny carl bilbrew 6 and his daughter 
fecia bilbrew 5 all of nearby jackson bilbrew was a selfemployed 
concrete worker 
watkins said there were no witnesses to the 1230 pm fire and 
that bilbrew and the childen died immediately 
mckay said hospital personnel noticed the fire only after the 
explosion of some shotgun shells sitting in the burning truck he 
said no gun was found in the truck although a knife was recovered 
he also said no gasoline container was recovered 
the childrens mother connie bilbrew was at work in the 
hospital cafeteria when the fire occurred watkins said she had to 
be sedated after being told of the deaths he said she wouldnt be 
questioned at length until friday at the earliest 
however he said mrs bilbrew indicated in a brief interview 
immediately after the fire that the couple had divorced about two 
years ago but had lived together for about a year until they split 
up again a few weeks ago 
watkins said mrs bilbrew had custody of the children but she

the kinsey institutes board of trustees 
gave a vote of confidence to its besieged director wednesday and 
called for an outside review of the sex research conducted during 
her tenure 
the trustees said a review conducted last year by a faculty 
committee was flawed and had misled university administrators who 
called for the resignation of the institutes director june 
reinisch in december 
in a statement the trustees said the new review would be 
conducted by a panel of experts not affiliated with indiana 
university which houses and partially funds the 40yearold 
institute 
the previous review had presented no evidence to substantiate 
charges made against reinisch by anonymous accusers the board said 
those charges included that reinisch has managed the institute 
poorly and failed to conduct enough research during her six years 
there 
unfortunately these charges have been accepted by the internal 
review committee as true and they appear to have misled university 
administrators about the quality of her contribution the 
statement said 
the board said reinisch may have made errors of administrative 
judgment and offended some institute workers but while these 
faults are serious they are not worthy of public censure 
the second review will deal only with testimony on the quality of 
the research conducted during reinischs tenure 
reinisch who is president of the 10member board of trustees 
said she had nothing to do with writing the statement and did not 
vote on whether to release it 
obviously i am very relieved to have a public statement from 
my board of trustees she said 
if theres going to be an outside review i hope that it will 
be done as quickly as possible since weve been through a very long 
period of turmoil and it will be another period of uncertainty 
reinisch said 
the trustees noted that university regulations require a second 
review by outsiders but none had been commissioned 
the statement recognized reinischs many achievements 
including bringing more recognition to the institute and starting 
programs to help the public with sex information 
although the board said there might have been more research 
produced during reinischs tenure they cited a negative climate 
in federal support the timeconsuming nature of revitalizing a 
moribund organization and the distractions of accusations made 
against her 
since her arrival at kinsey reinisch has brought in more than 
34 million 
a spokeswoman for morton lowengrub dean of the college of arts 
and sciences and the official who called for reinischs resignation 
said lowengrub would have no comment on the trustees statement

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini has pardoned 
political prisoners in iran in a general amnesty declared during 
celebrations marking the 10th anniversary of the islamic revolution 
tehran radio announced wednesday 
neither the state radio nor the official islamic republic news 
agency both monitored in nicosia specified how many prisoners 
would be freed or when the amnesty would take effect 
the state radio said khomeini proclaimed the amnesty at the 
request of intelligence minister mohammad reyshahri who said in a 
letter to the revolutionary patriarch that the political groups no 
longer constitute a threat to the revolution 
the radio said all but 900 prisoners jailed for belonging to 
outlawed opposition groups will be freed under the amnesty 
the 900 have been directly involved in crimes reyshahri 
said 
irans main opposition group the iraqibased mujahedeen khalq 
had said 140000 dissidents were arrested in recent years as 
khomeinis islamic revolution consolidated its grip on power after 
overthrowing the monarchy in 1979 
reyshahri a hardliner and soninlaw of president ali khamenei 
told khomeini he proposes all imprisoned members of the grouplets 
be pardoned regardless of the judicial stage of their cases 
irna reported 
it quoted khomeini as agreeing and hoping authorities will treat 
the pardoned prisoners kindly and in a brotherly manner and would 
encourage them by providing them with employment facilities 
khomeinis latest amnesty followed a wave of executions in which 
hundreds of political prisoners and captured antikhomeini activists 
have been reported slain 
the executions have taken place despite signs that tehran is 
moving toward easing political social and religious restrictions 
after the aug 20 ceasefire in the war with iraq 
the government has said it will allow political parties to form 
provided they do not conspire against the state 
the mujahedeen have said claimed more than 12000 iranians have 
been executed since august 
in a statement wednesday the mujahedeen called the amnesty a 
trick to gain support and called on the united nations to verify 
amnesty releases 
khomeini finds himself in dire need of an amnesty claim on the 
eve of the 10th anniversary of his faltering rule said the 
statement there is nothing but demagogery and deceit to this 
ploy 
the londonbased amnesty international which monitors human 
rights worldwide said last week that it knows of more than 1500 
executions in that period 
the us state department also criticized human rights abuses in 
iran in a report issued tuesday 
stories of torture in irans prisons are rampant and cover 
mock executions threats of sexual abuse and floggings the report 
said 
last month khomeini announced that thousands of prisoners who 
had served onethird of their sentences would be freed during the 
10th anniversary celebrations which end saturday hundreds have 
already been released 
that amnesty apparently aimed primarily at common criminals 
rather than political prisoners did not include prisoners serving 
life terms sentenced to death drug smugglers spies and hardcore 
opponents of khomeinis regime 
khomeini also suspended executions of drug smugglers during the 
10day anniversary celebrations 
at least 132 alleged drug traffickers were publicly hanged last 
month amid a ferocious antinarcotics campaign which includes a new 
law mandating death for anyone found possessing even small 
quantities of drugs

amos n andy pulled from the cbs 
schedule 25 years ago after protests about its portrayal of blacks 
could be heading for broadway thanks to a decision by a federal 
appeals court 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals overturning a lower court 
ruled that cbs did not have blanket trademark rights to the show and 
its characters and a playwright who brought the action five years 
ago said wednesday he still has plans for his proposed musical based 
on amos n andy 
im going ahead said stephen silverman author of the 
musical fresh air taxi ive rewritten the script and now im 
looking for a producer 
the ruling monday allows silverman or anyone else to use amos 
jones andy brown algonquin j calhoun the kingfish and any other 
characters connected with the show before 1948 as well as such 
phrases from the show as holy mackrel aint dat sumpin and 
scuse me for protrudin 
george schweitzer senior vicepresident of communications for 
cbs said the network was reviewing the option of taking the 
case to the us supreme court 
the comedy series featuring the black characters was introduced 
on radio in the 1920s with the roles played by whites 
the show came to television on cbs in 1951 and were played by 
blacks cbs had purchased all the rights to the characters in 1948 
from freeman gosden and charles correll the white actors who 
created the characters on radio 
silverman a former newspaper columnist who wrote the recent 
the fox that got away and an upcoming biography on director 
david lean conceived of the musical in 1981 
the name was based on the cab company in the show owned by the 
title characters 
silverman contends he tried to contact cbs about use of the 
characters but was continually rebuffed and ignored 
he argued that cbs had abandoned its trademarks by not using the 
characters since the show was pulled off the air in 1964 due to 
protests about the portrayal of blacks 
the litigation began in 1984 in august 1987 district judge 
gerard goettel ruled that although cbs had not used the properties 
or revealed plans for any use it had shown that it wanted to hold 
the option 
but the threejudge appeals panel said that at the time the issue 
came to court the amos n andy trademarks had not been used for 21 
years 
despite the reasonable explanation cbs gave for not using amos 
n andy the judges found that the trademark cannot be protected 
if use was discontinued for more than 20 years and there were no 
plans to use or permit its use in the foreseeable future a bare 
assertion of possible future use is not enough 
however the judges upheld the networks rights to all scripts 
produced after 1948 and said no determination on infringement could 
be made until the play is produced 
silverman may use aspects of the amos n andy materials 
including names stories and characters to the extent that such 
elements of expression are contained in the pre1948 radio 
scripts which are in the public domain the judges said 
court papers showed commitments topping 500000 including 
enlisting jazz star jabbo smith to write the music and vernal 
bagheris the director of one mo time to direct

a jewish settler was burned to death wednesday 
when a firebomb struck his car in the occupied west bank the army 
said three palestinians were reported killed by army gunfire and a 
fourth was slain in a prison riot 
the surge of violence came a day after the us state department 
issued a report alleging the israeli armys handling of the 14month 
palestinian uprising led to a substantial increase in human rights 
violations in the occupied territories 
wednesdays deaths raised to at least 378 the number of 
palestinians killed since the uprising began against israeli rule in 
the occupied territories the jewish settler was the 16th israeli to 
die 
the firebomb struck the mans peugeot near the west bank 
settlement of alfe menashe a jewish enclave close to the arab 
village of qalqilya the army said 
israel radio quoted an alfe menashe resident as saying the 
auto was caught in traffic and a firebomb was thrown at the car 
no one left the car 
but the radio later said a preliminary police investigation 
revealed no evidence of a firebombing such as a broken bottle or 
shattered glass though the car was badly burned 
the radio said police have doubts the car was firebombed but 
gave no details on how the car caught fire an army spokesman 
speaking anonymously in line with army regulations said the car did 
not crash and that a report on the incident would be released 
thursday 
the driver 38yearold albert jerassi who also lived at the 
settlement was killed the radio said 
settlers tried to converge on the scene but army soldiers 
ordered them away the radio said the army also clamped curfews on 
three nearby arab villages apparently to aid searches for the 
attackers and to keep settlers from rampages 
prime minister yitzhak shamir told reporters for the third 
time i think people have been burned alive inside our country by 
these rioters everybody should understand that we cannot stand 
against this with empty hands 
on oct 31 a mother her three young children died in a firebomb 
attack near the biblical west bank town of jericho a soldier who 
attempted to save the family later died of complications from smoke 
inhalation 
in april 1987 a jewish woman from alfe menashe died in a firebomb 
attack on her car in the same area her son died later of wounds 
hundreds of inmates rioted wedesday inside the military prison at 
megiddo in northern israel after officials halted visitations 
because relatives outside were throwing stones and raising banned 
palestinian flags army officials said on condition of anonymity 
prison director col yehuda saran told israel radio the mood in 
the prison became tense stones were thrown at guards and some 
inmates tried to escape over fences 
they guards first opened fire with rubber bullets and then 
opened fire with live ammunition when the prisoners began to try to 
escape and there was serious danger saran said 
israel radio said the dead prisoner whose name was not released 
was from the west bank town of tulkarem and had been shot in the 
lower back 
however an army spokesman said he was not killed by an army 
bullet but had his skull broken he said the army was 
investigating 
israel radio estimated 1300 people were involved in the fracas 
army sources said they included 150200 palestinian families outside 
the gates 
saran told israel radio he does not believe the incident was 
sparked by the state department charges our treatment is very 
humanitarian and i dont think the riot has anything to do with the 
report he said 
israels foreign ministry defended army activities in a 15page 
response saying troops are forced to act because of 
ploaffiliated or islamic fundamentalist radicals who have used 
massive stone barrages firebombs and even firearms against jews 
and arabs 
the army confirmed two palestinians were fatally shot in 
stonethrowing clashes with israeli troops in the west bank they 
were identified as jamal salim zakarni 17 who was shot in the 
stomach and banam gradat 18 who died of a chest wound 
arab hospital sources said an unidentified 20yearold 
palestinian died from a plastic bullet wound to the head suffered a 
day earlier in a clash in the gaza strip 
merchants closed most shops and businesses in the occupied 
territories wednesday in response to a strike call from the 
palestine liberation organizationbacked leadership of the uprising 
a strike also was scheduled for thursday to mark the start of the 
15th month of revolt

five central american nations that have 
signed a regional peace accord asked the united nations on wednesday 
to send inspectors to verify that none of their countries supports 
subversion against a neighbor 
foreign ministry officials from nicaragua honduras guatemala 
el salvador and costa rica asked un secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar to send west german spanish and canadian inspectors to 
their nations 
they also asked that latin americans be included in the 
inspection team 
all the people who participate in this process will be military 
observers but they are not going to be armed said foreign 
minister rodrigo madrigal nieto of costa rica 
it will not be a large group of soldiers they are just 
observers 
perez de cuellar who met central american foreign ministry 
officials on wednesday told reporters he is considering sending 
military observers 
the central american proposal submitted in a letter in spanish 
on wednesday to the un chief breathes new life into the peace 
plan initiated by president oscar arias of costa rica who received 
the nobel peace prize for his efforts in 1987 
plans for the force have already been drafted un officials 
said on condition of anonymity and spain canada and west germany 
have agreed to contribute observers 
a joint unorganization of american states team that went to 
central america in 1987 recommended unarmed civilian inspectors 
possibly backed with military advisers and the ministers letter 
urged perez de cuellar to rely on its recommendations 
honduras a key us ally where the contras have bases to launch 
raids into neighboring nicaragua blocked the 1987 plan by refusing 
to allow inspections of military sites 
now honduras has backed the plan some observers say honduras is 
afraid the presence of the contras will prompt nicaraguas superior 
forces to cross into honduras 
the united states has accused nicaragua of aiding leftist rebels 
fighting a usbacked government in el salvador 
in their letter the central american foreign ministry officials 
specified that the inspectors would make sure no country harbors 
rebels fighting another government or aids an insurrection in 
another country 
the us mission to the united nations will not comment on such a 
force until after the latest round of talks end thursday said 
helene mahoney a us spokeswoman 
wilfredo montalvan one of seven directors of the nicaraguan 
resistance an umbrella group of rebels said in miami on wednesday 
the position of the secretarygeneral is incomplete it 
doesnt to any good to send military groups to the nicaraguan border 
when people inside the country are rebelling against aggression 
he said the united states should also try to ensure the 
democratization of nicaragua and not just check on rebels at the 
borders 
we are at this time readying a new peace plan that includes 
disarming the nicaraguan resistance but only when there is proof of 
democracy inside nicaragua montalvan said 
he said that peace plan will be ready by sunday 
the foreign ministers of the five nations reached basic agreement 
on the inspection plan when they met for presidential inaugurations 
in mexico in december and venezuela last week 
west germany would have to send civilian observers because its 
constitution prohibits sending military forces abroad said a west 
german diplomat on condition of anonymity 
the presidents of the five central american nations are to hold a 
twoday summit in el salvador beginning monday

the director of a ussoviet cultural exchange 
group denied federal charges wednesday that he tried to conceal 
money provided by a soviet organization the fbi has called a 
communist party front 
alan thomson 57 accused the fbi of scare tactics in making the 
criminal charges and said the agency falsely described his 
organization the national council of americansoviet friendship as 
a prosoviet propaganda group 
whats behind this is an accusation of espionage that they 
dont dare make said thomson because they cant they know 
theres no basis 
thomson was arrested tuesday on an indictment charging that he 
tried to evade bank reporting requirements on 17000 he received in 
moscow from the ussr society for friendship and cultural relations 
with foreign countries 
the fbi has said the society directs activities of thomsons 
group and in turn is run by the soviet communist party to distribute 
disinformation or propaganda meant to enhance the soviet 
unions image 
thomson called that nonsense saying his group was a 
nonpartisan independent organization involved in ussoviet 
visitor exchanges we have no political line he said in a 
telephone interview 
he refused to discuss the criminal charges but denied wrongdoing 
thomson said his group has an agreement with the ussr friendship 
society under which the groups send each other tourists and 
exhibits he said he did not know if the communist party runs the 
society but called that fbi charge scare language that could 
neither be proved nor disproved 
such charges are part of the operation that goes way way back 
that anybody who doesnt agree with the administration must be 
sinister thomson said theyre trying to put a scare into the 
peace movement 
the indictment alleged that thomson had the 17000 deposited in 
a buffalo bank in two transactions each under 10000 evading the 
requirement that the government be notified of transactions of 
10000 or more 
he was released after his arrest on a 100000 personal 
recognizance bond the charges carry a maximum of five years in 
prison and a 250000 fine

the food and drug administration has scheduled 
a public hearing for early april to more closely examine the 
prospects for aids antibody testing kits which could be used in the 
home officials said wednesday 
the issue of home aids testing has been surrounded by 
controversy and the fda has been concerned that the tests be 
accurate and that adequate counseling could be incorporated into a 
hometesting system for the fatal disease 
the whole public health service is very much concerned that you 
have a system that gives adequate results and that the results can 
be explained to people said paul parkman director of the fda 
office that regulates the materials used in the test kits 
it also has implications for behavior he said if people 
are indulging in highrisk behavior and want to be tested they 
should have some contact with people to tell them they should not 
run those risks 
on the other hand the public health service of which fda is a 
part also feels aids testing should be widely available and 
there are some people who dont want to go to the doctor and be 
tested but would test themselves at home he said 
the dilemma has so far kept hometesting kits off the market 
the fda last april turned back requests by manufacturers who 
wanted to market an aids test kit and the agency said research on 
such kits would have to be done in hospitals clinics and other 
traditional health care settings 
parkman said he knew of no manufacturers who had applied for 
permission to conduct market research as restricted by the fda 
the fda also said at the time it would hold a public hearing in 
the future which could lead the agency to revise its policy against 
the tests 
the hearing is scheduled for april 6 
the kind of test that has the greatest chances of meeting with 
fda approval would allow someone to puncture a finger extract a few 
drops of blood that would be absorbed by a piece of filter paper and 
send the sample to a laboratory the same tests currently used by 
doctors hospitals and clinics would be performed on the sample to 
detect the presence of aids antibodies 
the person would get the results of the test by calling the lab 
and giving a personal code number 
but public health service guidelines say any testing should be 
accompanied by appropriate counseling and health officials are 
concerned that telephone contact may not be enough to deal with the 
emotional impact of learning one has a lifethreatening disease

a soviet ballet troupe lacking the financial 
backing to continue its debut us tour staged a free performance 
wednesday that enticed hundreds of dance lovers to fill a wicker 
suitcase with cash and checks 
officials still were not sure whether the donetsk ballet dancers 
would be able to complete their 15city tour which originally was 
scheduled to run into april 
we have a meeting after this performance and well have to work 
it out at that time lyric opera president robert m pomory said 
just before intermission 
pomory said later that the benefit had brought in about 4000 
that will be used to provide food and shelter for the dancers 
the troupes financial troubles began when a group of california 
and mexican investors withdrew 200000 last week upon learning that 
dancers from wellknown soviet troupes couldnt leave the soviet 
union to join the tour 
arts patrons pomory and the howard gilman foundation of new york 
responded by donating meals and cash so the dancers could be put up 
in a baltimore hotel while the tours future was sorted out 
wednesdays benefit drew an enthusiastic crowd of more than 600 
people who paid no admission but were asked to donate cash to help 
the tour continue 
its tragic whats happened said john talbott just after he 
dropped a check in the wicker suitcase at the entrance to the lyric 
opera house a lot of america is going to miss a really exciting 
classical troupe if they are not supportive 
talbott and his wife susan said they remembered seeing the 
famed bolshoi ballet when it made its first us tour in 1959 they 
had high reviews for the donetsk troupe most of whom are under 25 
they really are marvelous im ashamed that the place is not 
overflowing susan talbott said 
several times during the performance the crowd broke into 
applause and shouts of bravo 
i wanted to support them i think its important that a 
community respond to a human need such as this when theyre such 
fine artists said martin siegel of columbia 
the performance wednesday was as much an expression of thanks by 
the dancers as it was a way to raise money pomory said 
the dancers want the people of baltimore to know this is from 
the bottom of their hearts he said 
the troupe had performances booked in detroit chicago and 
columbus ohio the dancers arrived in late january and their first 
performance was feb 2 in baltimore 
soviet dance star vadim pisarev was allowed to join the troupe 
but several other wellknown dancers were not said organizer jan 
urdzik of californiabased heart of the art inc

president bush says he still wants some sort of 
pay raise for congress judges and top federal officials even 
though he signed the death warrant for a 51 percent increase he 
initially endorsed 
bush was inviting suggestions for future raise proposals at a 
meeting with republican senators tuesday according to sen ted 
stevens ralaska 
and in a white house statement released after he signed the 
resolution defeating the raise bush said i believe that some 
level of pay increase is in order and i will be working with the

americans generally dont sit still for big pay for their 
legislators although a 73 percent raise went through in hawaii 
recently with hardly a murmur new hampshire legislators make 100 a 
year and havent gotten a raise since 1889 
in new mexico where legislators make 75 a day theyve only 
gotten four raises since becomming a state in 1912 when the 
compensation was 5 a day in rhode island the pay is still 5 a 
day and no one seems to know if or when there ever was a raise 
the problem for lawmakers is summed up by rep bob brawley of 
north carolina who tried unsuccessfully to double legislative pay 
in his state from to 21375 
everybodys going to use it for political fodder rather than 
the realities of the pay scale brawley said

multibilliondollar cost of the savings and loan bailout are 
mobilizing more than 1200 regulators to take control of all 
remaining insolvent sampls over the next few weeks 
the massive government takeover was announced tuesday as 
financial regulators scrambled to implement the first portions of 
president bushs sampl overhaul package 
meanwhile the bush proposals were receiving initial favorable 
reactions from congress although some lawmakers said they had 
reservations about some aspects of the proposals in particular the 
40 billion estimated cost to taxpayers 
officials of the federal savings and loan insurance corp which 
insures deposits at sampls and the federal deposit insurance corp 
which performs the same function at banks predicted that within a 
month they would have joint regulatory teams in place at 
approximately 224 insolvent sampls

insurmountable odds

whitlock is his halfbrother sydney the threehour show was 
originally made for british television

until he dies a horrible alcoholic death in reality he died of 
dropsy and he did see charlie before he died 
after his death the family is forced to move into a basement 
flat both boys are in and out of workhouses the mother who was 
mentally ill spent time in asylums until chaplin brought her to

mother was also a singer she used to say to charlie theres a man 
passing outside make up a story about him charlie was a very 
sentimental performer because of his musichall background later 
when he made talking pictures his voice was very puton because of 
that background 
the show also stretches credulity by suggesting that chaplin 
learned some of his most famous comic routines from his father 
i get to sing and dance a little said mcshane i do a 
thing with the cane and hat i also do a number with the finger 
rolls that chaplin did in gold rush he stuck the forks into the 
finger rolls and made them dance it looks easy until you try it 
the miniseries was filmed partly on location in south london 
where chaplin grew up most of it was filmed on a set built outside 
of london for the jack the ripper miniseries starring michael

every day but especially on valentines day 
stormie jones quietly gives thanks for the historic transplant 
operation five years ago that gave her a new healthy heart and 
liver and a new healthy life 
i just think of how lucky i was because i survived the heart 
and liver transplant that nobody ever had stormie said i think 
about how lucky i am to have a lot of friends that really truly 
mean a lot to me 
the first recipient of a heartliver transplant and the only 
one to survive has learned to adjust since doctors saved her life 
feb 14 1984 
i leave all the bad things in the back of my head and i keep 
all the good things in front of my head the 11yearold explained 
matteroffactly so i dont have to worry about whats going to 
happen later on 
its easy all you have to do is think good thoughts some days 
you might feel a little bit bad but you try to think about good 
things 
good things include playing basketball and climbing trees at home 
in white settlement texas bad things are returning to childrens 
hospital of pittsburgh because of complications and seeing other 
sick youngsters die 
when stormie and her sister misty were smaller they would 
pretend things would go away and things would get better said 
their mother lois purcell misty said were older now mom and 
we just cant do that 
mrs purcell 32 tries to think good thoughts but its not easy 
i worry a lot as she gets older she gets more risky at 
playing of course theres supposed to be no contact sports for 
these kids anyway well stormie is so normal its just kind of hard 
to keep tabs on her 
mrs purcell also lives with the nagging knowledge that stormies 
immune system at any time could reject her transplanted heart and 
liver those fears intensified recently when stormie developed liver 
problems that required her to return to childrens hospital twice in 
three months 
i was really shocked by the whole ordeal because she had done 
so well we thought we had it made that nothing could go wrong 
now 
misty 14 took the news particularly hard like stormie she 
suffers from a cholesterol problem but its treatable by diet 
during stormies monthlong hospitalization in november surgeons 
removed a bile duct obstruction she was back in january for a week 
because of elevated enzyme levels that interfered with her 
antirejection medication 
theyre not tremendously serious but theyre quite stressful 
probably for everyone said dr thomas e starzl who performed 
the transplant she doesnt need another transplant shes fine 
stormie was dying when starzl decided in january 1984 that her 
only hope would be a heartliver transplant she suffered from a 
rare congenital disease that increased the cholesterol in her blood 
to nearly 10 times normal because of the imbalance caused by a 
faulty liver she had suffered two heart attacks and underwent two 
triple coronary bypasses and a heartvalve replacement 
the 16hour transplant instantly improved stormies chances for 
life her dramatic progress paved the way for two more heartliver 
transplants during the next year in pittsburgh but both patients 
died within a few days of surgery 
shes proud of the fact that she made medical history mrs 
purcell said before she wouldnt show anybody her scar but now 
shes not shy about it shell raise her shirt to a certain point 
and say see 
stormie takes five types of medicine a day including 
cyclosporine a costly antirejection drug she will need for the 
rest of her life her blood is tested several times a week to make 
sure her organs are functioning properly medicine and care are 
covered for the most part by insurance mrs purcell who has 
remarried since her daughter had the operation was forced to hold a 
garage sale however to finance their recent trip here friends and 
neighbors are establishing funds to help cover costs including 
education 
because her case is unique stormie faces a trip to pittsburgh 
every time a potentially serious problem arises 
god forbid if anything should happen to this child said her 
mother but if they have to do it again they will know something 
and that makes us feel better they wont have to look at the 
parents and say we dont know

even in times of trouble or political 
controversy about a cabinet choice nominating a senator past or 
present usually opens a smooth fast track to senate confirmation 
not this time 
secretary of defensedesignate john tower is the problem nominee 
in president bushs cabinet class of 89 although a 24year senate 
career has so far enabled him to withstand challenges that probably 
would have undone an outsider 
while it is evident that some among towers former colleagues 
would have preferred a different pentagon choice president bush and 
his spokesmen almost surely are correct in maintaining that in a 
senate vote he would be confirmed 
no newly elected president has been denied confirmation of a 
nominee to his first cabinet and the administration insists there 
has been no thought of withdrawing the selection bush announced 
nearly two months ago after a preview round of controversy 
tower and louis sullivan the black educator nominated to head 
the department of health and human services are the last cabinet 
nominees awaiting confirmation 
their cases illustrate the advantages of a senate resume 
the tower nomination has been delayed by investigations involving 
his personal life women and whiskey in texas parlance 
that overshadowed the question of his highpriced consulting work 
for defense contractors after he left the senate in 1985 there are 
no restrictions on such activities by former members of congress as 
soon as they leave office 
towers consultant fees totaled more than 763000 
thats heavy bucks sen alan simpson rwyo said sunday 
i think thats more of a conflict than anything with regard to his 
personality 
sullivan is taking unpaid leave from morehouse university school 
of medicine in order to join the bush cabinet in the process he is 
forfeiting 297000 in sabbatical leave pay earned over 13 years as 
president of the atlanta medical school in order to avoid any 
appearance of a conflict of interest 
the school gets about 58 million a year through the department 
of health and human services 
thats small change in the world of defense contracts 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee 
told tower he was concerned about the perception of those consultant 
fees i know you to be an honest person he told tower a former 
chairman but i do worry about the perception 
the tower confirmation hearings may also stir some worry among 
other consultants about customer perceptions of their services 
tower said he got the fees for enlightened guesswork and for 
being available when clients called 
i gave them sort of academic advice on what could happen he 
said any number of think tanks in town could have given them more 
detailed analysis 
that kind of candor could spoil things in the business tower left 
behind when he canceled his consultant contracts on dec 1 a day 
after bush aides contacted him about possible pentagon appointment 
tower has said that the consultant fees would not influence his 
pentagon decisions and he has denied that his personal habits are 
out of line he said he has no drinking problem and that a secretary 
of defense must at all times be capable of exercising the duties of 
his office 
president bush said the senate is performing properly by looking 
into every question involving tower even though the process is 
taking a little longer than i would like confirmation hangups are 
not customary for senators who need approval of their former 
colleagues 
thats one reason senate names have been sent to the senate in 
times of political strain 
after the saturday night massacre in 1973 richard m nixon 
needed an attorney general to succeed elliot l richardson who quit 
in defiance of white house orders to fire the special watergate 
prosecutor nixon chose sen william b saxbe of ohio who was 
confirmed by the democratic senate with a minimum of watergate 
debate 
in 1980 secretary of state cyrus r vance resigned because he 
disagreed with president carters attempt to rescue the american 
hostages in tehran by force carter chose sen edmund s muskie of 
maine to succeed him gaining senate approval without refueling the 
controversy 
former sen tower brought controversy with him

get your tax refund fast the hightechnology way 
thats the pitch offered by increasing numbers of tax preparers 
and financial institutions trying to attract customers in the 1989 
income tax filing season 
to deliver on their promise they use the internal revenue 
services electronic filing system through which individual returns 
are filed directly by computer over telephone lines rather than 
through the mail 
last year 500000 of the approximately 107 million returns 
received by the irs were filed electronically according to wilson 
fadley an irs spokesman 
this year the service expects the number to reach 2 million 
its kind of a wave of the future fadley says 
electronic filing is available in 36 states this year through 
some 4000 irsapproved data transmitters including taxpreparation 
firms and computer service bureaus that work with banks and other 
financial institutions 
plans call for the system to operate nationwide next year at this 
time fadley says 
to find out if and where electronic filing is available in your 
state the arthur young tax guide advises inquiring at your local 
irs taxpayer service or the tollfree national information number 
18004241040 and asking for the electronic filing coordinator 
judging from several test calls made on a recent weekday morning 
getting through on the tollfree number may take patience and 
persistence 
electronic filing isnt available to individuals using their own 
personal computers though it may be someday thus you can expect 
to have to pay someone to provide it for you either in the form of 
an explicit charge or built into a tax preparers fee 
for example the dollar dry dock bank in the new york 
metropolitan area charges 45 
what are the benefits the most tangible is faster access to your 
federal tax refund especially if you have a large amount due you 
but there are other pluses as well as your return is processed 
for electronic filing any mathematical errors you may have made are 
likely to be detected 
with electronic filing you get a confirmation from the irs that 
your return has been received 
the irs likes the system too since it reduces the costs of 
processing returns 
people who owe additional taxes cant use the system as it is set 
up now if youre in this position youre probably in no rush to 
pay anyway unless you were underwithheld in 1988 by so much that 
you are threatened with penalties and interest charges 
before you deal with a bank or other financial institution that 
promotes electronic filing services investigate all the trappings 
of the arrangement 
a bank may even offer to deposit the amount of your refund on the 
spot into an account in your name 
if this involves opening a new account it makes sense to inquire 
what sort of an account it is what interest it will pay and 
whether there are any restrictions on withdrawing the money and 
closing the account 
wouldbe electronic filers might feel leery of getting involved 
in direct dealings with the irss computers the process strikes 
some people as the sort of highprofile activity that invites extra 
scrutiny from the irs and its auditors 
not so the authorities say the arthur young tax guide offers 
the solemn assurance that electronic filing neither increases nor 
decreases the possibility that your return will be audited

housing prices have had a startling rise in many 
sections of the country in the past decade or so leaving analysts 
still searching for the reasons why and wondering if something still 
eludes their calculations 
popular explanations have included the rising cost of land a 
surge in the number of couples in the prime homebuying years of 
ages 25 to 34 restrictive building and zoning codes a tax code 
that feeds demand and rising rents 
whatever the reason the median price of existing homes has risen 
from 48700 in 1978 to 70300 in 1983 to 85600 in 1987 and 
88100 in october of 1988 in august 1988 it was even higher at 
91400 
an even sharper ascent can be traced for new homes which sold 
for a median price of 55700 in l978 and 75300 in 1983 last year 
the median price more than doubled that of a decade earlier 
reaching 118000 at one point 
while at least a score of additional reasons can be offered for 
the ascent one factor is sometimes overlooked that is bigger 
more rooms baths square footage and probably better houses 
quality materials central airheat are being built today buyers 
are trading up not just in price but in product too 
over a relatively short period of time these improvements can be 
traced in 1972 for example the census bureau found that only 43 
percent of new singlefamily houses had central air conditioning in 
1987 the figure was 71 per cent 
in the same period the percentage of houses with two or more 
baths rose to 83 from 53 and those with fireplaces jumped from 38 
percent to 62 percent the percentage of houses of 1600 square feet 
or more rose to 59 from 38 
but it is over an even longer period that the improvement in 
housing becomes impressively clear 
in 1940 when the census bureau conducted its first housing 
census the median value of owneroccupied homes was 2938 the 
dollar was worth more then of course but even if you quadruple the 
price to 12000 it was low 
now consider some of the reasons in that year more than a 
million precivil war housing units were still occcupied thirtyone 
percent of the nations homes had no running water and 45 percent 
didnt have complete private plumbing wells cisterns rain barrels 
and outhouses were common 
that same census found that 143 million units or less than half 
of all homes had central heat of the 198 million housing units 
without central heating about 16 million relied on stoves 
fewer than half the homes in that year had mechanical 
refrigeration equipment while 93 million homes relied on ice 
about 99 million used other means of cooling such as spring 
houses or had no way to protect perishables 
other improvements include electricity builtin conveniences 
such as dishwashers insulation fireresistant materials patios 
pools family rooms and the electronic house of the future might 
make these seem oldfashioned 
whether you believe the house of today represents true value when 
compared to the old days is as much a matter of personal judgment as 
of any scientific cost estimate the comparison isnt made to 
justify todays prices 
in fact there exists a vocal if rather small percentage of the 
economic fraternity who believe too much money is going into 
housing and that the nation would be better served by investing the 
funds in manufacturing instead 
but any comparison of yesterday with today illustrates the point 
that housing for most people in the past was something closer to 
rudimentary shelter than in this day and age when lifestyle 
prevails and cost seems no obstacle

with public school textbooks rarely mentioning 
religion growing efforts are being made to overcome this gap in the 
education of the young 
they simply cant know about the real world without 
understanding the intensity of religious faith throughout history 
says ernest l boyer president of the carnegie foundation for 
advancement of teaching 
but they arent getting that understanding now conclude an 
accumulating succession of studies which say schools and their 
textbooks virtually exclude information about religion 
this has reduced the quality of the education we are providing 
to our children says boyer former us commissioner of education 
he is the chairman of a review board of educational experts that 
is developing a oneweek course for elementary and high schools on 
the principles and problems of religious liberty 
it was the second major undertaking recently to get schools to 
teach about religious factors in life 
the board was formed in cooperation with the williamsburg charter 
foundation a nonpartison nonsectarian project working for a more 
balanced place for religion in public life 
for far too long weve had a remarkable silence on teaching 
about religion in the nations public schools says boyer saying 
this largely stems from fear such teaching might violate the 
constitutional principle of separation of church and state 
however the new projects emphasize adherence to that principle 
and to supreme court decisions outlawing organized prayers or 
devotions in schools 
the irony is that those decisions ine court justice tom clarks majority 
opinion said 
ones education is not complete without a study of comparative 
religion and the bible is worthy of study for its literary and 
historic qualities 
however studies find one after another that the schools mostly 
ignore the subject 
the findings have come from strong churchstate separationists 
such as americans united for separation of church and state and 
people for the american way as well as from various professional 
education groups 
there is a glaring omission of religion in public school 
curricula says the nations largest educational leadership 
organization the assocation for supervision of curriculum 
development 
it urged local schools education agencies textbook publishers 
and educators to develop instructional materials and methods to 
teach about religion in various areas such as history literature 
and political science 
absence of religion has led to a collapse and distortion of 
history says ol davis a professor of education at the 
university of texas on the ascd panel 
in addition to the new study aids being developed through the 
williamsburg charter foundation a broad coalition of 14 national 
educational and religious groups joined recently to issue a guide on 
teaching religion in the schools 
the guide was sent nationwide last fall to school boards and 
educators 
it suggests ways for teaching about religion that are termed 
consitutionally permissible educationally sound and sensitive to 
the beliefs of students and parents 
the school may sponsor study about religion and about 
various beliefs but not sponsor the practice of religion nor 
promote any particular view of it the guide says 
among educational groups sponsoring it were the american 
association of school administrators american federation of 
teachers national education association and the ascd 
religious backers included the national conference of christians 
and jews national council of churches national association of 
evangelicals christian legal society and baptist joint committee on 
public affairs 
the williamsburg charter foundation says of its project 
the question of religion and education appears to be a 
minefield of controversies with resulting ignorance 
confusion and reluctance to deal with it 
however the present moment offers a strategic opportunity to 
do so since extreme positions and unwelcome consequences have 
become obvious and a new desire for consensus is evident the 
foundation says 
there is now a widespread belief among educators parents and 
national leaders that education without appropriate attention to the 
role of religious liberty in american life is incomplete 
the instructional materials called living with our deepest 
differences are being developed by a project coordinating 
committee headed by henry c johnson jr of pennsylvania state 
university 
they are to be introduced in pilot schools this year and offered 
across the country in 1990 
they include a teachers manual appropriate references and 
instructional materials based including historical and contemporary 
documents and audio visuals for a fivelesson unit in grades five 
eight and eleven 
os guinness britishborn sociologist and director of the 
foundation says that increased secularism religious variety and 
conflicts between religion and science has made the need for 
teaching about it all the more important

twentyseven national jewish organizations have 
banded together to try to resolve the recurring conflict over who 
is a jew under israels law an issue presently shelved by a 
coalition government 
it is tempting to believe that the issue is behind us 
but regretably that is not the case said the new coalition for 
jewish unity it seeks settling the problem rather than merely 
reacting to each crisis 
the coalition includes conservative and reform jewish bodies but 
not the orthodox branch with which talks were to be pursued on 
differences about jewish conversions 
israels orthodox parties have sought legislation recognizing 
only orthodox conversions to judaism an effort recently stopped by 
formation of the coalition government

ruling that it could keep its local property 
the court granted ownership of the church building and grounds to 
st johns protestant episcopal church of bellevue and dayton 
reversing a court of appeals ruling in favor of the episcopal church

claire hoess wife of the austrian ambassador 
does her share of teapouring at diplomatic receptions but her real 
passion lies elsewhere shes determined to fight the war on drugs 
you cant beat this problem from above you have to shock 
the kids says the englishborn mrs hoess a lanky woman who 
wears her blonde hair cropped short and likes to relax in jeans 
soon after she moved here about a year ago mrs hoess vowed 
shed do something constructive to fight drugs in a city which last 
year had the highest murder rate in the country 
police blame much of the crime on the drug dealing that takes 
place in neighborhoods just a few miles away from mrs hoess 
residence 
on a trip to new york mrs hoess visited daytop village a 
leading drug treatment center where former addicts performed a 
gritty improvisational play based on their experiences in the 
depths of a depraved drug world 
so impressed was mrs hoess with the play entitled the 
concept that she decided to bring it to washington for two 
performances 
im not doing this as a social event mrs hoess said in an 
interview i want it to have an impact 
to that end mrs hoess arranged for the district of columbia 
school system to have high school seniors attend a scheduled 
performance monday at a local theater 
members of the diplomatic corps and other washingtonians have 
been invited to a second performance 
we think its a great idea said marilyn tyler brown an 
assistant school superintendent the students will get to see 
people who have been through a substance abuse program 
mrs hoess initiative is more unusual than typical in the 
diplomatic circuit where some women do volunteer work but few 
launch out in their own projects according to phyllis moyer 
executive director of the hospitality and information service a 
nonprofit group that helps foreign diplomats adjust to washigton 
mrs hoess who sometimes spends her free time driving around the 
city to get a firsthand look at the seamier parts of town raised 
money to bring the troupe to washington and then convinced a 
hotelier to donate rooms for two nights she even got inmates at a 
local prison the lorton correctional complex to print the 
invitations 
mrs hoess was awakened to the drug problem in the early 1970s 
i saw what was happening to the friends and their children 
she said citing one case in which a 12yearold walked through a 
window 
back in vienna headquarters of the un narcotics bureau mrs 
hoess plunged into fighting drugs on an international level she 
studied the problem and learned about the drug culture 
since coming to the united states she has toured drug 
rehabilitation centers in new york and atlanta and talked to 
business leaders and bankers about devoting more money to such 
facilities 
mrs hoess said she likes to be personally involved in issues 
while visiting zaire once she traveled to a leper colony in the 
bush that had been set up by albert schweitzer 
the staff wanted to give mrs hoess the handsoff tour for 
dignitaries but she rejected that idea 
i put on my dirty old jeans and started cleaning the floors 
like the other people she recalled

each night a flat and barren stretch 
of border comes alive with the muffled sound of tires rolling north 
over the baked earth the vans and cars go lightless in the dark 
their cargoes silent and hopeful 
the stretch of otay mesa is one of the areas most vulnerable to 
illegal immigration along the united states 1950mile border with 
mexico 
thats why the immigration and naturalization services 
enforcement arm wants a fourmile ditch dug to provide a traffic 
obstruction that nature lacks 
border patrol officials defend the plan as justified because 
theyre swamped by alien smugglers driving through the border if it 
works for them the officials say it can work for those bringing 
drugs into country 
but the symbolism of the barrier likened by a justice 
department official to a buried berlin wall has generated a 
firestorm of controversy 
the south bay chapter of the mexican american political 
association denounced the ditch as a feudalistic approach to 
international relations the mexican government suggests it was 
deceived about what it had been told was a concretereinforced 
drainage ditch and san diego officials stung by the failure to 
seek their comment on the project are indignant 
were dealing with a very organized group of people theyre 
not just mom and pop out here smuggling for the weekend said ken 
stitt of the brown field border patrol station they know when our 
shifts are and theyll hit us at shift changes things like that 
the smugglers make 250 to 2000 a head depending on whether 
the aliens trip began in mexico or central and south america stitt 
said with the stakes so high aliensmugglers increasingly take 
desperate measures to slip past the border patrol onto a network of 
roads less than a quarter mile from the border 
theres very little regard on the part of these drivers for the 
people in their vehicles he said theyve thrown rocks at our 
agents people have fallen out and been run over because the door 
popped open theyve held up babies letting us know women and 
children are in the vehicle 
only a small fraction of the 1550 known vehicle drivethroughs 
in the otay mesa area since july 1 resulted in apprehensions 
the 2 million ditch would be wide enough 14 feet and deep 
enough five feet to obstruct illegal traffic while providing a 
needed drainage channel 
us immigration officials see the ditch as an innocuous way to 
help regain control of the san diego border area where about 
onethird of the 12 million alien apprehensions last year were made 
supervisory border patrol agent michael gregg said the vast 
majority of the 1988 arrests only two of five illegal crossers 
were caught in the sector occurred along 10 miles from the beach 
east to the base of otay mountain 
i think the people living south of the border are going to keep 
coming said alberto ala an undocumented worker living in a san 
diego county migrant camp mexico is a hungry country and we need 
to eat i dont think a hole in the ground can stop us we can 
always go around it 
they cant build a hole from the beach of tijuana all the way 
to brownsville texas so we will find a way to cross regardless 
through the air ocean or any other way it doesnt matter what i 
feel whatever the us government wants to do it does whether it 
works or not 
the federation for american immigration reform a washington 
lobbying group criticized the ditch as a halfway measure and called 
for 55 miles of elaborate security fences along the usmexico 
boundary to halt what spokesman patrick burns called an onslaught 
of humanity 
the sunken fences proposed by fair which is seeking 
congressional sponsorship would cost about 3 million per mile 
they would be fronted by a slope leading to a 12foot concrete 
retainer topped by an 8foot curving metal fence the group 
proposed financing the barriers and other border security devices by 
charging people a 2 fee to cross the border 
border patrol officials view some of the fair proposals as 
unrealistic in expense and impact on international relations 
for the most part i dont think our agents want a fortress 
along the border stitt said we realize that most of the people 
coming across the border are doing so for one thing to eat so 
theres empathy there but at the same time we just have to have 
some control 
all these proposals do is raise antimexican hysteria said 
al ducheny of the mexican american association no amount of 
fences and border guards and ditches is going to resolve the illegal 
immigration problem 
any reasonable person looking at these plans has to ask where 
does the need for security stop and our need to improve relations 
with our neighbor begin 
the irony of the uproar over the ditch proposal which next will 
be the subject of an environmental impact report is that it 
originated in response to mexicos concerns over increased runoff 
from otay mesa 
development has changed the land and as warehouses factories 
and roads are built on the mesa the paved ground on the san diego 
side cant absorb runoff mexicos adjacent flatlands could become a 
quagmire from excess rainwater now following the lands gentle slope 
toward tijuana 
the concern of the drainage was a concern mexico broached to 
us in 1986 said bob ybarra of the us section of the 
international boundary and water commission in el paso texas the 
commission was set up 100 years ago to carry out boundary and water 
treaties requiring joint engineering work 
the us section studied alternatives and we find that the 
ditch is the only practical way to settle an international issue 
ybarra said 
before completion of a final review of the ditch the us 
section was told of a border patrol plan to build concrete barriers 
in the same area to try to curb the illegal drivethroughs ybarra 
said concrete barriers would have excacerbated drainage problems 
he declined comment on why mexico wasnt told of the ditchs dual 
purpose 
mexican officials now appear noncommittal toward the project 
which some mexican politicians see as unfriendly and the border 
patrol admits that the premature release of the deterrent aspects 
became a public relations disaster 
we really had hoped it could be explained and once people 
understand what it is or at least educated to what the problem is 
that it wouldnt have that connotation stitt said in no way 
will it resemble a berlin wall either in looks or in what its going 
to accomplish 
this is not just a problem the border patrol has its a 
problem the nation has

there is ample precedent for ronald reagan to 
make millions off his memoirs but the moneymaking activity of former 
presidents is still a sore subject with many americans 
it was in fact a basis for congress decision more than 30 
years ago to grant pensions and office allowances to former 
occupants of the white house 
the idea according to a senate committee report issued in 1986 
was to ensure that former presidents can live dignified retired 
lives free from the need to commercialize and demean their status 
as elder statesmen 
nevertheless before the law was passed and since past 
presidents have profited sometimes handsomely from writing 
speaking and business connections 
presidential scholars are divided on the propriety of reagan 
receiving a reported advance of 5 million for his memoirs and a 
book of speeches and signing a reported 40000aspeech contract 
with a lecture agency 
he should not make one dime for writing a book of what he did 
as president or for speaking thats what i think said political 
scientist james david barber of duke university a leading student 
of the presidency 
but daniel p franklin a political scientist and expert on the 
presidency at colgate university said i frankly dont see 
anything wrong with president reagan writing a book and getting some 
money we tend to hold our politicians to in some case unrealistic 
standards 
i think what it shows is that the expresident is still seen as 
a symbol and there is an idea that in some way the symbolic nature 
of the presidency is compromised just by virtue of his accepting 
monetary gain franklin said 
president bush was asked at his first presidential news 
conference on jan 27 about the reagan deals and whether he 
thought it was appropriate to cash in on the presidency 
i dont know whether id call it cashing in i expect every 
president has written his memoirs and received money for it the 
president said 
when asked whether it might not create a perception of 
wrongdoing he said no because i think theres been a long of 
history of that and i dont think its ever been challenged as 
inappropriate 
bush said he had read that president grant received 500000 for 
his memoirs at a time when half a million really meant something 
grant bankrupt and dying of throat cancer wrote his memoirs of 
the civil war in his last months in the hope of providing for his 
family eventually his heirs received 450000 in royalties 
although grant did not live to enjoy any of it his twovolume work 
is considered a classic war commentary 
as a matter of fact he was a much better autobiographer than 
he was a president said franklin 
when president truman left the white house in 1953 he wrote in 
his memoirs he turned down lucrative offers from industry some of 
them involving little work because i knew that they were not 
interested in hiring harry truman the person but what they wanted 
to hire was the former president of the united states i could never 
lend myself to any transaction however respectable that would 
commercialize on the prestige and the dignity of the office of the 
presidency 
truman did sell the rights to his memoirs to life magazine for 
600000 
nevertheless he was not a wealthy man and he answered his mail 
using his own pen and paper and paid for stamps out of his own 
pocket the 1986 report of the committee on governmental affairs 
said 
with trumans experience in mind congress enacted legislation in 
1958 giving former presidents for the first time pensions and an 
allowance for their office expenses reagan gets a federal pension 
of 99500 a year and an office allowance of up to 300000 
richard nixon after his resignation from office in 1974 in the 
wake of the watergate scandals received an advance of more than 2 
million for his memoirs plus 600000 and a share of the profits for 
a series of televised interviews with british talk show host david 
frost 
nixon like dwight eisenhower before him accepts no speaking 
fees 
he has been offered up to 100000 for speeches is routinely 
offered between 15000 and 20000 and we estimate we turn down 
about 675000 worth of offers a year for speeches said john h 
taylor the former presidents administrative assistant 
his position is that he at least as a former president feels 
most comfortable speaking out only on substance and only when he 
thinks his doing so will help the country said taylor there is 
no implied criticism of how others do it i am just telling you how 
president nixon does it 
thats fascinating said duke political scientist barber 
here you have the most unethical president of the 20th century who 
is being more ethical than the others 
nixons successor gerald ford and his wife received about 1 
million for their memoirs and ford was paid 1 million by nbc to 
appear in documentaries and be available for television interviews 
over a fiveyear period 
ford also accepted offers to serve on the boards of a number of 
corporations by 1987 he was serving on eight at fees of up to 
30000 a year and was a consultant to others at fees up to 
100000 his spokesman robert e barrett says ford is now cutting 
back on such activity 
both nixon and fords successor jimmy carter have shunned 
membership on corporate boards reagans spokesman mark weinberg 
said reagan has not accepted any that i know of and i dont know 
what plans there are in that regard 
barrett defends fords business activities saying the 
president doesnt create the opportunities those demands are there 
as a result of where society has gone in the last 15 to 20 years 
he is sitting there and hes going to do some of this stuff 
barrett said ford usually gets 15000 to 20000 for a speech 
but might speak for as little as 7500 in some cases such as 
speaking to a group in rancho mirage calif where he lives over 
the years the spokesman estimated the average fee per speech has 
been less than 12000 
former president carter received an undisclosed advance for his 
memoirs keeping faith after a number of new york publishers 
were invited to meet with him 
carter is also in emand as a speaker on college campuses most 
recently at memphis state university last month 
bob young director of the student activities council at memphis 
state said we made an offer of 10000 and it was turned down 
then i found out that if we would offer air transportation to and 
from georgia that that would help us out so i counteroffered with 
10000 plus a round trip on a private plane one of our vice 
presidents helped us get the plane donated and he accepted the 
offer

lyndon b johnson donated profits estimated at 15 million from 
his memoirs the vantage point to support the lbj library in 
austin and the lbj school of public affairs according to library 
archivist claudia anderson johnson also was paid a reported 
300000 for three hourlong interviews with cbs ms anderson said 
she could not determine whether this money also went to support the 
library and school 
as for reagan the former film star was asked during his flight 
home to california on jan 20 whether with the white house behind 
him he might make any more movies he replied no there is kind 
of a lingering feeling that would look a little bit like trying to 
cash in on this job that ive had 
six days later simon amp schuster announced that reagan had signed 
a contract for the two books terms were not disclosed but industry 
sources said the former president could easily command 5 million 
the next day bernie swain a partner in the washington speakers 
bureau said he was signing both the former president and his wife 
nancy to a contract making the bureau their exclusive lecture 
agent again the terms were not announced but sources said reagan 
should get about 40000 a speech 
during senate hearings in recent years on legislation to limit 
expresidents office allowances concern was expressed that staff 
paid by the taxpayers could be used to help them write for profit 
nixon aide taylor said he has always taken pains to maintain 
separate accounting and make sure that all expenses having to do 
with the personnel and equipment used to assist him in his research 
are paid for from his own funds 
barrett speaking for ford also said we kept everything very 
separate 
stuart applebaum director of public relations for bantam books 
which published keeping faith said carter writes his books 
himself 
weinberg asked if staff paid out of reagans office allowance 
would be involved in preparation of his memoirs said no nobody 
here has done anything of that nature so far and i havent heard 
any discussion of it

peering through an admittedly cloudly crystal 
ball the bush administration hopes the departure of soviet troops 
from afghanistan will produce a friendly nonaligned government that 
logically would remain on good terms with moscow 
it wouldnt disturb us officials either if the usarmed 
guerrillas absorbed some remnants of the kabul regime into the new 
government in an effort to promote unity and avert a bloody 
lastditch defense of kabul by followers of president najibullah 
but the realistic prediction at the state department is that the 
rebels will try to lay siege to kabul after the last soviet troops 
leave while the defenders will put up a vigorous though 
shortlived defense because prospects of amnesty are slim 
the rebels will continue to receive us arms through pakistan 
though the flow may slacken because they have recovered a powerful 
arsenal from defectors and departing soviet troops 
there could be a peaceful transfer said a wellplaced state 
department official but i doubt it seriously 
ever since the red army rolled into afghanistan in december 1979 
the overriding us policy objective was to force them to go home 
again 
nearly all of the more than 100000 troops who backed the 
promoscow regime in kabul are gone the remants are expected to 
depart just before the feb 15 deadline set in the geneva accords of 
last april 
the us objective will soon be met and us policy is entering 
a less anxious phase 
its still important to have a stable afghanistan the 
official said in an interview tuesday in which he barred use of his 
name wed like it to have reasonably friendly relations with its 
neighbors first of all our good friend and ally pakistan 
and the united states wishes to have friendly relations with the 
new government as well 
at the same time in the us view economics and geography both 
point toward good afghan relations with the soviet union next door 
the soviets buy afghanistans natural gas and the country is a 
major trade route with pakistan as well 
certainly there isnt going to be an antagonistic regime in 
kabul although we dont see any communist regime as prospering 
the official said 
but the rebels are divided between ardent moslem fundamentalists 
and less militant guerrillas who reflect the sunni majority in 
afghanistan the rebels are also divided on whether to rally around 
the former king zahir shah 
because of all the uncertainty the bush administration is mostly 
enjoying the soviet exodus and keeping its fingers crossed and the 
weapons flowing 
we dont have a clue how it will play out the official 
acknowledged

the 12nation european economic community is 
trying to transform itself into a single market by 1992 a unified 
trading bloc that an agriculture department analyst says could mean 
more trouble for american farmers 
by the end of 1992 the eec plans to perfect its internal 
market and remove further obstacles to the free movement of people 
goods services and capital between the member countries says 
ernest koenig of the departments foreign agricultural service 
although complete integration may be years away the planned 
steps in that direction may conflict with us interests he said 
tax labor business and investment regulations in a single 
european market undoubtedly will favor eec members 
to what extent such regulations and preferences will affect the 
united states and other eec trading partners is unknown at this time 
the move toward an integrated europe has not met with unanimous 
approval within the bloc british prime minister margaret thatcher 
says she can never accept a united states of europe 
although mrs thatcher favors removing barriers that restrict 
free trade whe wants eec borders to remain for security reasons and 
does not want a single market to lead to a monetary union with a 
single currency and a central bank after 1992 
but france west germany and the nine other countries say the eec 
must head for that goal if it is to compete effectively with japan 
and the united states 
if there is uncertainty about 1992 and the years after there is 
little doubt about the position of the eec in todays world trade 
and there is no mistaking that the 12nation bloc even if has some 
old aches and pains can flex plenty of muscle 
according to a usda study several years ago the 12member eec 
had a population of about 320 million with 11 million employed in 
agriculture in 1984 those represented 89 percent of the eecs 
civilian employment 
in the united states with a much smaller population 
agricultural employment was 332 million in 1984 or 32 percent of 
total civilian employment 
the eec had 98 million farms in 1984 averaging only 42 acres 
each compared with 23 million farms averaging 438 acres 
a major complaint of us trade people has involved the eecs 
protective import system and readiness to subsidize exports as a way 
of getting rid of surplus production for years the united states 
has sought freer world trade and has complained often about eec 
policies 
one of the fears of us trade experts and american producers is 
that the situation may worsen instead of improve with the coming of 
the 1992 plan there would be much to lose 
recent trade figures speak for themselves in the fiscal year 
that ended last sept 30 us agricultural exports totaled 353 
billion of the total shipments to eec countries were valued at 
more than 75 billion 
collectively the eec is the largest foreign market for american 
farmers japan at 727 billion last year is the biggest 
singlecountry buyer 
koenig writing in a new issue of agexporter the successor to 
foreign agriculture magazine said that the united states has 
encouraged eec integration but has stated repeatedly its concern 
for fair treatment of nonmembers 
for instance he said there is talk among eec members of 
requiring identical or equivalent technical and regulatory 
conditions in nonmember countries called reciprocity before 
granting them certain benefits of free access to eec markets 
whatever the shape of things to come exporters who wish to 
succeed in a post1992 environment must pay close attention to 
developments as they unfold koenig said 
but the eecs longstanding common agricultural policy which 
includes support of domestically produced commodities and their 
protection against foreign goods has already determined what kind 
of conditions the united states will face after 1992 
internal price supports probably will decline but import 
protection and export subsidization are likely to continue koenig 
said this scenario could change if the eec adopts a more 
marketoriented policy in consequence of the uruguay round of the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade 
the 1992 model eec will not have a single sovereign government 
he said although the european parliament will increase its power 
slightly it will lack the authority to interfere in a member 
countrys affairs the council of ministers will remain the 
legislative branch of the eec and the commission will continue as 
its executive branch

whether facing down dynamiters or fighting forest 
fires the national park services highest ranking woman has spent 
most of her 30year career fending off threats to americas most 
precious natural resources 
as one of 10 regional directors lorraine mintzmyer oversees 41 
parks including some of the crown jewels glacier mount 
rushmore rocky mountain grand teton mesa verde and the mother of 
them all yellowstone the worlds first national park 
in the three decades it has taken the 53yearold civil servant 
to work her way up from secretary she has survived many political 
storms but the uproar over last summers wildfires which burned 
706278 acres within yellowstone and cost millions of dollars was 
one of the sorest tests in a pioneering career 
let it burn was the name critics gave the parks natural fire 
policy the subject now of congressional hearings in washington 
dc and around the country including one scheduled tuesday in 
cody wyo 
the park services wildfire management plan in effect in 
yellowstone since 1972 gave officials discretion in suppressing 
lightningcaused fires which usually were allowed to burn unless 
they threatened life or property 
but last summers extraordinary drought combined with experts 
miscalculations on just how dry yellowstone really was forced the 
interior department to declare total fire suppression parkwide on 
july 21 by then however it was too late 
ultimately 25000 firefighters struggled unsuccessfully to 
contain eight major blazes in and around yellowstone only an early 
autumn snow brought the conflagration under control in midseptember 
throughout the crisis ms mintzmyer consulted almost daily with 
park service director william penn mott and interior secretary 
donald hodel along with yellowstone superintendent bob barbee 
it was she who backed barbees decision to limit the use of 
bulldozers to cut fire lines a decision which angered senators and 
congressmen from the region as well as hundreds of monday morning 
quarterbacks who thought the park service deliberately dragged its 
feet in firefighting efforts 
she still believes her judgment call was right 
as responsible managers we cant be defensive when our 
decisions are questioned or our policies are challenged she said 
i think over the long term there will be a realization that the 
park and the people who were fighting the fires were doing the best 
they could under the circumstances 
its one thing to deal with an event like a hurricane or an 
earthquake because it happens in one day and then its done you 
clean it up you live with it but its quite another thing to go 
through months of it as we did 
its a test the likes of which id never had before 
she praised barbee who endured public ridicule and threats we 
know that every time we do something in yellowstone it takes on 
proportions which just do not accrue to other areas said ms 
mintzmyer 
we all get tired regardless of what profession were in the 
test is whether you get up the next morning and go at it again 
barbee has that kind of stamina his boss said but hes not 
alone 
i have the energy of two people she boasted 
at midlife she is an avid outdoorswoman and inveterate hiker who 
tries to sneak in an outing or two in her parks when she visits them 
on business her region covers utah colorado wyoming north 
dakota south dakota and montana 
dressed in her official olivecolored park service uniform her 
only flamboyance is fireenginered fingernails and the gold ring 
she had fashioned from her distinguished service pin the gold 
embossed circle is one of her most prized possessions 
as only the second woman in park service history to be awarded 
that honor ms mintzmyer was acutely conscious that she was a 
trailblazer as she became the first female superintendent of a major 
park then the first woman regional director 
i know that ive got to do a good job so that other ladies will 
have an opportunity if i were to falter it might be difficult for 
some of my successors to overcome that she said 
always an overachiever she grew up in a small iowa town where 
music dominated her life she left a banking career and joined the 
park service in 1959 after a less qualified man got the job she 
wanted 
she started out as a clerkstenographer became program and 
budgeting officer transferred as superintendent of herbert hoover 
national historic site in iowa and took the helm of buffalo 
national river in harrison ark in 1977 shortly after that park 
service unit was established 
there local people were dead set against the park and the 
governments assertion of eminent domain to buy up private land

the 1989 mazda 929 is a study in understated luxury and 
convenience 
its easy to see why mazda is so proud of this its flagship 
vehicle the 929s 3liter v6 an 18valve fuelinjected 
powerplant that produces up to 158 horsepower at 5500 rpm was 
smooth and flawless with the fourspeed overdrive automatic 
transmission just touch the accelerator and you felt the car pull 
itself together and zoom you were off 
the trunk lid was heavy and there was a solid thud upon closing 
the doors indicative of a solid wellbuilt car inside the 
fourdoor sedan felt roomy the optional leather seats were 
comfortable and looked plush yet elegant dashboard instruments 
were arrayed impressively over twothirds of the dash but were 
clearly marked and easy to read 
but what do you expect when you lay out 25000 in the test car 
you could expect more it had the optional feature that allows 
changes in the way the auto rides 
by touching a button on the center console the driver can select 
soft sport or automatic suspensions the soft adjustment puts front 
and rear shock absorbers at the normal setting the sport adjustment 
puts them at the firm setting and automatic adjusts their firmness 
according to the cars speed 
i preferred the sport setting and found it to be a nice 
compromise between some of the more punishing sport suspensions of 
racier cars and the floating sensation on some bigger luxury cars 
overall handling on the 929 was admirable the car felt nimble 
and maneuvered as easily as some smaller cars in tight spaces the 
test 929s transmission also could be switched from economy to power 
mode when great acceleration was needed 
this is accomplished by delaying the shifting to higher speeds 
than under the economy mode the economy mode helps on fuel economy 
however 
buyers also should note that the 929 ranked third last year in 
having the least number of complaints from new buyers the toyota 
cressida and chevrolet nova were first and second respectively 
the 1988 initial quality survey by california marketing firm 
jd power and associates noted that with the 1988model 929 the 
first 929 to appear in the united states mazda had successfully 
avoided the quality pitfalls that befall many automakers with new 
models 
i found only one very minor flaw in the fit and finish of the 
test 929 one of two metal flanges for the lid of the center storage 
space kept coming out of its slot making the lid difficult to close 
fully 
also because the 929 was reardrive it tended to fishtail a bit 
on slick road conditions mazda said it sold 6913 of these cars in 
calendar 1987 the 929s first full year here but that rose to 
more than 24250 last year a spokeswoman said there were no 
projections for calendar 1989 
typical buyers are what mazda calls middleaged parents median 
age is 45 70 percent of the buyers are male and 83 percent are 
married the median annual income is 63900 and 61 percent have 
college education 
mazda ranked the acura legend and audi cars as major competitors 
to the 929 because they are similar in price and size because of 
the newness of the 929 to the united states consumer reports 
magazine had no report of owner complaints 
a final note the 929 may not be the last word from mazda in the 
luxury market 
the company reportedly has been studying whether to follow its 
japanese competitors honda nissan and toyota and bring out new 
luxury performance car products

with an advertising slogan like its not 
whether you win or lose but whether you win you can bet the 
product has something to do with donald trump 
the billionaire property mogul has teamed with milton bradley 
maker of some of the countrys most popular games and on tuesday 
threw a media event in the glittering atrium of trump tower on 
manhattans swank fifth avenue to unveil trump the game 
never known for hiding his light under a bushel trump stood 
beside a muchlargerthanlife replica of the board game box cover 
emblazoned with his widely familiar likeness as he tossed out a 
ceremonial 14karat die 
he drew applause from onlookers when he revealed he will donate 
to charities his share of the proceeds from sales of the game which 
goes on store shelves in april for about 25 
ill do as well as i can for milton bradley said trump he 
named several charities including aids research and helping the 
homeless as intended beneficiaries of his undisclosed portion of 
the profit 
george ditomassi milton bradleys president declared this 
deal is one that we truly believe is a golden opportunity for milton 
bradley people are obviously fascinated by donald trumps world of 
multimilliondollar wheeling and dealing 
the company a division of the big toymaker hasbro inc intends 
to make marketing the trump game its top priority this year he 
said milton bradley will keep its percentage of the profit 
milton bradley and trump teamed up to develop the game which 
tries to recreate the dealmaking of highrolling real estate 
developers 
players advance their t tokens around the board and attempt 
to outbid each other for bigticket properties such as luxury 
hotels glitzy casinos and airlines once all the real estate has 
been snapped up players cut deals attempting to control 
increasingly bigger pieces of the action 
the game comes with trump cards that players draw as they 
carry out their buying and selling fantasies and fake cash with no 
denominations smaller than 10 million no need to mention whose 
picture is on the play money 
essentially its a much more sophisticated version of 
monopoly said trump referring to the hugely successful parker 
brothers game i love monopoly ive played it all my life in many 
forms 
will average americans take to trump the game 
apparently milton bradley is convinced of it lawrence i 
bernstein a vice president for marketing said more money will be 
spent promoting the game than on any other in the companys history 
that covers famous titles like candy land chutes and ladders and 
the the game of life 
in an interview milton bradleys president ditomassi said that 
judging by the people who have read trumps autobiography trump 
the art of the deal trump has a following among people of all 
backgrounds not just millionaires

a sevenyear switch in the pattern of treasury 
bond yields could be a sign of declining inflation but rising 
shortterm interest rates economists say 
on tuesday for the first time since april 1982 shortterm 
interest rates rose above longterm interest rates by a widely 
followed measure 
economists said the high shortterm rates reflected the 
tightmoney policies of the federal reserve which is trying to 
wring inflation out of the economy by discouraging borrowing 
the economywatchers said rates on mortgages and consumer loans 
could rise in the weeks ahead but in the long run the tight money 
should bring down inflation and interest rates 
the ultimate message is that markets expect future inflation to 
be lower than current inflation said lawrence kudlow chief 
economist of bear stearns amp co 
some other analysts said the switch could spell trouble noting 
that past flipflops in short and longterm rates often reflected 
credit crunches that led to recessions 
if banks raise their prime lending rate to cope with the squeeze 
by the fed a whole range of consumer rates that are tied to the 
prime automatically would rise the prime rate is 105 percent and 
many analysts predict it soon will be raised to 11 percent 
longterm rates are ordinarily higher than shortterm rates 
because investors demand higher yields in return for the risk of 
keeping their money locked up for longer periods 
but for the last year shortterm rates have been rising and 
longterm rates falling trends that culminated in tuesdays 
flipflop 
the rise in shortterm rates has been brought about by the 
federal reserve which uses the higher rates to discourage 
borrowing cool off the economy and prevent inflation from getting 
out of hand 
meanwhile the feds tactics have won the confidence of 
inflationwary investors because they are no longer demanding such 
a big premium to keep their money tied up in bonds longterm rates 
have fallen 
the socalled inversion of the yield curve occurred tuesday 
morning by the end of the day the yield on the treasurys 
threemonth treasury bill was at 882 percent and the yield on the 
benchmark 30year bond stood at 879 percent 
by some other measures say comparing yields on the 30year 
bond and the oneyear note the inversion in yields had already 
occurred 
kudlow said the inversion in yields signals a decline in 
inflation that will be good for both stocks and bonds 
skeptics say the federal reserve does not have a delicate hand on 
the tiller of the economy and is very likely to cause a recession by 
pushing shortterm rates too high 
since the civil war all 22 times the yield curve has inverted 
there has been a recession or a growth recession in which 
industrial production declined according to raymond dalio 
president of bridgewater associates in wilton conn 
dalio said tuesday that a flat yield curve is necessary for now 
because the united states needs high shortterm rates to attract 
foreign money and prop up the value of the dollar but he said if 
the fed overdoes the tightening which he expects there will be a 
deep downturn emerging at the end of 89 or the beginning of 90 
the current situation perplexes money managers who have to 
decide whether to put money into shortterm or longterm debt 
securities said dale krieger managing director of carnegie hill 
asset management in new york 
on one hand managers can get guaranteed annual returns of 9 
percent by putting money into shortterm instruments but by doing 
so they miss the chance to get in at the start of what some believe 
will be a bull market in bonds brought on by declining inflation 
krieger said his firms clients are playing it safe passing up 
speculation in the bond market and pulling in unusually high yields 
on shortterm debt for us this is a gift he said

the three major commercial television networks 
want relief from regulations limiting how much primetime 
entertainment they can produce for themselves 
the networks who say rising program costs have forced them to 
boost their ad rates also want to be able to invest in some of the 
shows produced for them and share in money the shows make after 
completing their network run 
the network executives disclosed tuesday that they plan to resume 
their longrunning talks with hollywood producers aimed at reaching 
a compromise on those issues 
the chief executives at the three networks thomas s murphy of 
capital citiesabc inc laurence a tisch of cbs inc and robert c 
wright of national broadcasting co appealed for support as they 
fielded questions for 90 minutes before the association of national 
advertisers 
the executives said rising programming costs is the main reason 
they have had to boost ad rates 
the regulation suggestion infuriated independent television 
station owners who say viewers would have fewer choices if the 
networks had greater financial interests in programming 
this is a naked attempt by the networks to regain their former 
position of total domination of the broadcast television business 
said preston padden head of the association of independent 
television stations 
dewitt helm jr president of the association of national 
advertisers said an ana committee was studying the matter 
the network trios appearance came as the networks combined 
share of the viewing audience has fallen due to the rise of 
independent stations cable networks pay television and 
videocassette recorders 
tisch said the networks share of the primetime viewing audience 
slipped to 68 percent last year from 90 percent a decade ago but 
that he expected it would bottom out at about 6465 percent over the 
next few years 
abcs murphy conceded we are not as good as we once were but 
we are still the best buy in town 
murphy said the networks are hurt because they are limited to 
producing no more than five hours of entertainment programming each 
week for the 22 hours in their primetime schedule and cannot share 
in any of the financial rewards of programs sold for reruns after 
completing a network run 
murphy said the networks were proposing that they be allowed to 
produce or have a financial interest in 11 hours of primetime 
programming a week 
nbcs wright said the federal restrictions tie the networks 
hands even as they must compete for programs with nearly two dozen 
cable networks unconstrained by program ownership limits 
jack valenti head of the motion picture association of america 
said the program producers have offered a compromise that would 
allow the networks to own a half share in a limited number of 
programs 
without an agreement valenti said the restrictions on network 
ownership of programs is due to expire starting in late 1990 
valenti said the restrictions in effect since 1970 have served 
the consumer by encouraging the proliferation of independent 
stations and program choices 
the key issue is maintaining the balance of power in the 
marketplace he said he declined say whether a compromise with 
the networks is near 
on other issues the network executives were asked whether the 
nbc and abc alliances with cable in recent years amount to 
consorting with the enemy 
nbcs wright said the cable ventures are a logical extension 
of what his network does murphy whose company also cable 
interests said capital citiesabc took that position as well 
but cbss tisch said he has found less there than meets the 
eye and said cbs is better off to focus all its efforts on 
broadcast operations 
murphy and tisch said they would be open to considering an 
advertiserproduced series but wright said a potential problem is 
the ill will created if the network cancels the series because of 
poor ratings

european officials plan to up the ante 
in a trade battle that has been brewing for weeks over stiff tariffs 
imposed by the united states in retaliation for a ban on 
hormonetreated meat from america 
officials of the 12nation european economic community will press 
to have the duties declared in violation of international trade 
rules at a meeting today of the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade in geneva the 96nation gatt offers a forum for settling 
trade disputes among its members 
meanwhile a flurry of visits among highlevel officials from the 
united states and the common market trading bloc were scheduled in 
the coming weeks giving both sides a fresh chance to resolve the 
stubborn dispute 
frans andriessen the eecs top trading official was scheduled 
to travel to washington feb 1718 for talks with the new bush 
administration while the communitys agriculture chief ray 
macsharry was planning a trip later in the month spokesmen said 
tuesday 
the new us secretary of state james a baker iii was slated 
to stop in brussels on an upcoming swing through western europe 
the officials will no doubt discuss the troublesome dispute 
sparked jan 1 when the europeans imposed a ban on imports of meat 
from cattle treated with growth hormones a common us practice 
the united states has refused to comply with the prohibition 
which the europeans say was drawn up for health reasons in 
retaliation for the ban the reagan administration set 100 percent 
tariffs on european boneless beef pork hams and shoulders and a 
variety of other european products the sanctions are worth about 
100 million 
the trading bloc protested the retaliatory measures and filed a 
complaint with gatt saying that the unilateral action taken by 
the united states is not compatible with gatt rules and 
procedures 
it asked the international body to examine this matter and 
make a ruling on the legal issues and recommend appropriate action 
gatt members could rule on the dispute at wednesdays meeting 
but officials said such a quick decision was unlikely they raised 
the possibility that the issue could be referred to a threemember 
panel for study the panels generally take about six months to reach 
a finding 
foreign ministers representing the eec nations warned last month 
that they would impose counterretaliatory measures on imports of 
us walnuts and dried fruit if the two sides failed to move quickly 
to end the dispute 
the ministers delayed implementing the sanctions to give more 
time to settle the conflict they are scheduled to meet feb 20 on 
the matter 
the hormone ban was set to go into effect jan 1 1988 but the 
eec agreed to a oneyear delay it refused additional us appeals 
for postponement 
the europeans contend the growth stimulants pose a health risk a 
contention the united states disputes 
the prohibition is expected to block the importation of about 
100 million worth of us beef and beef byproducts 
the disputed goods represent a small chunk of the estimated 166 
billion in trade last year between the united states and the 
community whose members are france west germany italy 
luxembourg belgium the netherlands denmark greece ireland 
portugal spain and the united kingdom

opec oil ministers appear to be leaning 
toward holding a summit of their countries leaders possibly next 
year to mark the 30th anniversary of the founding of the 
organization analysts say 
subroto secretarygeneral of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries said recently that key oil ministers would 
discuss the proposal at a meeting scheduled for late next month in 
vienna 
venezuelas newly inaugurated president carlos andres perez has 
reportedly urged in recent trips to the middle east that a summit be 
held 
in his inaugural speech last week perez said he had found 
receptivity to the idea of celebrating at a convenient date a 
meeting of sovereigns and chiefs of state 
he said a meeting of opec chiefs of state is considered 
propitious to give approval to a strategy that will orient the 
organization during the 90s 
an opec summit was last held in march 1975 in algiers 
the oil ministers of ecuador iraq saudi arabia and venezuela 
met last week in venezuela afterward subroto said everybody 
present at the meeting expressed the need for the holding of an opec 
summit 
subroto according to the opec news agency said the proposal 
would be discussed by the eight oil ministers attending next months 
meeting in vienna the news agency said the ministers members of a 
monitoring committee would discuss the time place and theme of the 
proposed gathering 
analysts cautioned that scheduling a highlevel meeting would 
raise hopes that the leaders would act to strengthen the oil market 
failure to do so they said would deliver a sharp blow to the 
financial markets 
theres not a great deal they can do said londonbased 
analyst paul mcdonald i think it a summit would be about the 
most disastrous thing they could do i cannot imagine what on earth 
they could find to talk about 
oil prices have tended to climb in advance of recent opec 
meetings and often tumbled afterward when expectations of strong 
steps were dashed 
fergus macleod an analyst at barclays de zoete wedd in london 
said he doubted a meeting of the heads of state would be scheduled 
this year but he said there was a reasonable chance of one in 
1990 to mark opecs startup 
bahman karbassioun a consultant in vienna agreed there may 
be a summit maybe next year he said 
he said opec had planned a 20th anniversary summit in september 
1980 but the meeting was canceled when war broke out between bitter 
enemies iran and iraq 
by holding a 30th anniversary gathering macleod said the heads 
of state would have a reason to meet and hold down expectations 
in the markets 
the cartel was formed in september 1960 by iran iraq kuwait 
saudi arabia and venezuela it currently has 13 members 
the officials would likely review the goals of the organization 
and plot their strategy in the coming decade analysts said 
a 1990 summit would give the cartel time to assess the fresh push 
to restore discipline among its members and the impact of the august 
ceasefire between iran and iraq 
at a november meeting in vienna the oil ministers fashioned a 
new production accord in an effort to curtail their output and lift 
prices they set an overall production ceiling of 185 million 
barrels a day for the first six months of 1989 sharply under the 
levels at the end of last year 
the international energy agency estimated in its monthly oil 
market report that opec crude production in january was 194 million 
barrels a day off 34 million barrels a day from december 
saudi arabia the worlds no 1 oil exporter slashed production 
last month by more than 2 million barrels a day to an average of 45 
million barrels a day according to the newly released report 
crude prices have generally been rising since the output 
agreement was struck a pickup tied to optimism that the opec 
countries intend to stick to the individual output targets set in 
the accord prices though are still under the cartels benchmark 
of 18 a barrel 
as part of the accord the oil ministers set up the monitoring 
committee to watch prices in the market and members adherence to 
their new quotas panel members represent algeria indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait nigeria saudi arabia and venezuela 
other opec members are gabon ecuador libya the united arab 
emirates and qatar

wall streets inside traders drew the attention 
while a much larger financial crisis the disintegration of a good 
part of the nations savings and loan industry received little 
notice observers say 
i dont think the sampl crisis has gotten nearly as much 
publicity particularly in going after the crooks as ivan boesky 
and those types said edwin gray head of the federal home loan 
bank board from 198387 its almost a crime in its own right 
experts said the securities fraud scandals of the 1980s pale in 
comparison with the troubles in the trilliondollar thrift industry 
which this week prompted a 90 billion plan to staunch 100 billion 
in losses at hundreds of savings and loans 
i think the harm has been broader in the sampl problem not from 
the criminality per se but from the compounding of all the problems 
and the waste of economic resources bert ely a financial 
consultant in alexandria va said tuesday i think the wall 
street stuff is small change 
but the combination of shady dealings the allure of the stock 
market and an aggressive federal prosecutor in new york combined to 
overshadow at least in the public eye a scandal that may have 
grown unchecked for lack of enforcement in the mid1980s 
president bushs plan to rescue the savings and loan industry 
includes 50 million more for the justice department to attack 
fraud it would deploy extra investigators on 200 cases and add 
about 80 federal fraud prosecutors 
in addition federal regulators would be given broader powers 
civil penalties would be increased to fines of up to 1 million per 
day and criminal penalties would grow to 20 years or more in prison 
but some officials said the plan which comes two years after a 
steppedup federal probe in texas that resulted in 33 indictments 
may be too little too late gray said the bank board was uncovering 
fraud as early as 1983 
while doubling the number of examiners at the board which 
regulates the nations 3100 thrift institutions gray said he was 
stymied by the office of management and budget and the us justice 
department in pressing criminal prosecutions 
there were and are a lot of crooks down there said gray now 
president of chase federal bank in miami the problem is all of 
this is so late we all knew there was a problem in 1983 and 84 
in new york meanwhile thenus attorney rudolph w giuliani 
actively prosecuted securities fraud cases involving characters like 
boesky the nowjailed speculator who paid 100 million in fines and 
illicit profits to answer securities charges 
a handful of other cases from the arrest of a 24yearold 
inside trader to the recent record 650 million settlement with 
investment giant drexel burnham lambert inc also have drawn wide 
attention 
in contrast with the notoriety of insider trading the bank 
boards earlier probes of sampls often were kept quiet to avoid 
creating public panic a former bank board attorney said the board 
operated under the belief it was defending the industry it was 
designed to regulate 
hal levi who left the agency in 1982 after 10 years said the 
idea of giving bank board examiners greater investigative power was 
shot down as early as 1972 when one official feared they would 
become junior dick tracys 
clearly i think there was an absence of prosecution of those 
kinds of cases in the late 70s and early 80s even for ones that 
were referred to the justice department he said it was a 
neverending source of frustration to me 
rosemary stewart the bank boards current enforcement director 
said the justice department has not had enough prosecutors to handle 
the number of referred bank fraud cases 
just because a bank failed last year its unreasonable to 
expect that the owners who drove it into the ground will be in jail 
this year she said criminal enforcement work always follows 
these problems certainly its not too late 
added gray youve got to put your money where your mouth is if 
you want to go after these guys they have the sharpest attorneys 
the crookedest accountants theyre slimy like snakes and they know 
how to do these things

will consider bids from potential buyers 
malcolm l sherman chairman and chief executive officer of the 
rahwaybased vacuum cleaner company said regina would agree to be 
sold if people are interested and willing to pay a price that is 
fair and will satisfy our stockholders 
sherman said in a telephone interview tuesday that no specific 
price has been set 
the company is underfinanced sherman said reginas 
recently hired consulting firm bear stearns amp co felt that a 
sale might be the best way to make it stronger he said 
there is no timetable for the sale and the company will continue 
to operate on its own if no suitable buyer is found the chairman 
said 
we cannot ignore that consumer product companies are sought 
after today and that regina has one of the historically strong 
names in the consumer products market we have asked bear stearns to 
go forward sherman said

quality of its housekeeper line of vacuum cleaners introduced about 
three years ago the company has introduced an updated version of 
the housekeeper vacuum 
regina is facing several shareholder lawsuits filed in federal 
court in newark over its financial reporting

holly farms corps board of directors is 
urging company stockholders to enter a merger agreement with conagra 
inc and reject overtures from tyson foods inc 
holly farms spokesman ted bailey tuesday said the company would 
mail statements to shareholders soon seeking their approval of the 
conagra deal the company said a stockholders meeting would be 
convened as soon as possible to vote on a merger with conagra 
twothirds of both holly farms and conagras shareholders would 
have to endorse the merger in order for it to take place 
the board of the memphisbased chicken producer said conagras 
stockswap offer had less strings attached than the tyson proposal 
to pay 6350 per share for holly farms stock 
conagras stock trade deal has been valued at about 106 
billion and tysons 109 billion 
the holly farms board said tuesday that there were reasons to 
doubt that a deal with tyson could be completed 
plus the board said an opinion from investment banker morgan 
stanley amp co concluded the terms of the conagra agreement were fair 
to hollys share owners 
the company since its board meeting of jan 20 had invited 
tyson and conagra to improve the terms of their respective 
proposals the holly farms statement said 
conagra had made no changes tyson had added a condition to 
theirs and that along with the prospect of litigation between 
tyson and conagra had led the board to conclude that their concerns 
over the tyson proposal were even more acute than before 
conagra an omaha neb food and poultry processor and tyson 
of springdale ark have been courting holly farms for months

british airways plc today introduced changes in 
its first class service that it said were designed to win a bigger 
share of the 1 billion market for first class passengers on 
longhaul flights 
the airline recently privatized by the british government said 
it is investing 40 million to upgrade its first class service from 
which it earns nearly 400 million a year the changes detailed at 
a news conference in new york include individual passenger video 
terminals at each seat 
this investment is a bold and calculated bid for commercial 
supremacy in an intensely competitive market sir colin marshall 
the airlines chief executive said 
there are no indications of major growth in the first class 
market so our objective is to take business from other airlines by 
offering the highest standard of passenger service in the world 
in addition to the videos other changes include redesigned cabin 
interiors in first class and improvements in sleeperseats such as 
new swivel tables improved menus that give passengers freedom to 
eat when they wish and a new wine cellar 
the new service is scheduled to be introduced on longhaul 
flights starting march 1 
the videos which british airways called the worlds first 
individuallycontrolled passenger units are located in the armrest 
of the seats the airline said it is testing two video systems in 
first class service on four of its boeing 747s 
one system is made by fieldtech a british company while the 
other comes from avicom a subsidiary of us aircraft maker 
lockheed corp passengers will be able to choose a film from a 
library of nearly 50 video cassettes 
british airways said the changes in first class service reflect 
two years of research which has shown that first class passengers 
fall into two categories the patrician and the achiever 
the airline said its new service is aimed mainly at top business 
people from around the world predominantly male usually in their 
late 40s and holding the position of chairman or chief executive 
there are 18 first class seats in british airways cabins

general motors corp surprised automobile industry 
analysts by declaring a 2for1 stock split designed to attract 
small investors to the automakers stock 
analysts were split on whether the split would work 
charles brady of oppenheimer amp co of new york has been bullish 
on gms stock and thinks that small investors will head toward it 
once the split takes effect march 31 
david healy of drexel burnham lambert inc of new york took a 
different view 
i wouldnt bet the ranch on it he said 
and stock analyst deal gulis of william c roney amp co of detroit 
said even with the split which doubles the number of shares but 
cuts their value in half gms stock prices will remain high 
when it splits it will be 45 or 50 and even that is not a 
prime retailing price gulis said 
gm common stock closed tuesday at 9387 up 137 from the 
open gms announcement about the split and a 20 percent dividend 
increase to 150 a share came after the stock market closed monday 
gm sparked a rally among bluechip stocks that pushed the dow 
jones average of 30 industrials up 2607 points tuesday to its 
highest close since the oct 19 1987 stock market crash 
i think it is a big part of the rally today gulis said 
tuesday its a gm rally 
the dividend announcement was anticipated on wall street the 
split wasnt 
i was expecting they would do it especially since ford did 
it automobile analyst kathleen heaney of nikko securities co 
international inc said of gms dividend announcement 
on jan 12 ford motor co announced a 25percent increase in its 
dividend moving it to 75 cents a share but did not split its stock 
gm chairman roger smith said in a statement released with news of 
the dividend and split that the actions would make the companys 
common stock more affordable for individual investors by dropping 
the pershare price 
but some analysts questioned whether such a move would lure small 
investors back to the stock market which many have avoided since 
the october 1987 crash 
i think theyre afraid of the market in general it doesnt 
matter what company it is heaney said 
but brady said he was pleasantly surprised by the dividend its 
size and the split and thought the split would attract small 
investors 
theyll get another 5 percent to 10 percent of the people 
looking at the shares just because of the split brady said 
its much more in line with a retail stock presentation than it 
was at 90 a share 
brady who said the last time gm split its stock was in 1955 
said mondays announcements were the latest in a series of goodnews 
statements from the company 
also on monday gm announced it was reinstating hearing and 
vision care for its active and retired salaried employees the 
benefits had been withdrawn a year earlier 
what they really did here in that whole string of events is 
just exude optimism brady said 
smith has said 1988 will prove to be gms best year in history 
when earnings are announced next week

for 16 years pikeville has led the nation 
in per capita consumption of pepsi cola but that might not be 
enough to keep the doors open at the local pepsi bottling plant 
charles buddy boston manager of east kentucky beverage cos 
bottling plant in pikeville said monday that a decision to close 
the plant might be made in several weeks after a series of meetings 
with union officials 
right now its just in the discussion stages boston said 
no firm plans have been made and we will be negotiating with our 
union on that topic later this week 
boston said the company would discuss the situation with the 
united steelworkers of america which represents some of the plants 
100 employees 
the problem is with the plant and not with the local consumption 
habits that have boosted pikeville to the top of the nations pepsi 
consumption standings boston said 
although the machines inside the plant north of pikeville are 
very modern they are designed to package pepsi in returnable 
bottles boston said 
times and tastes change and its now cheaper and more convenient 
for customers to use nonreturnable containers such as plastic 
bottles and alumnum cans company officials said 
pepsi plants nearby in west virginia and virginia and elsewhere 
in kentucky already are equipped to produce the drink in 
nonreturnable containers boston said but converting the pikeville 
plant to nonreturnable production was still being discussed he 
said 
boston said he was confident of one thing regardless of the 
plants future pikeville will keep on drinking pepsi whether it 
comes from the local plant or from across state lines 
we dont expect that to change no matter what we do he said 
two other eastern kentucky cities hazard and corbin rank no 2 
and no 3 respectively in per capita pepsi consumption pepsi does 
not release figures on exact volume consumed per person

manufacturers to determine whether the fasteners were shipped and 
whether they were used by the european consortium airbus industrie 
airlines are not being required to check their planes barker 
said 
the manufacturers will be checking and reporting back to us 
he explained they are held accountable for the parts that go into 
their aircraft

national pizza co has filed suit in 
sedgwick county district court against pizza hut which is trying to 
block national pizzas attempt to acquire a chain of fastseafood 
restaurants 
national pizza based in pittsburg kan is the largest us 
franchiser of pepsico incs pizza hut restaurants its sole 
business has been operating pizza hut franchises 
the company last month made an unsolicited offer to buy skippers 
inc for 925 a share or approximately 27 million skippers 
which operates 213 restaurants in the western united states and 
british columbia has rejected the offer 
on monday pizza hut officials advised national pizza in a letter 
that the acquisition of skippers would violate its franchise 
agreement with pizza hut said jj fitzsimmons chief financial 
officer for national pizza which operates more than 225 restaurants 
we responded asking for specifics on how it would violate the 
agreement and they declined to provide details fitzsimmons said 
rather than wait for pizza hut to respond national pizza went to 
court on tuesday in an effort to resolve the matter fitzsimmons 
said 
they want us to be a singlepurpose franchisee after the way 
pepsi has been growing they dont want us to grow he said 
we believe their interpretation of the franchise agreement is 
discriminatory and unenforceable he said 
the lawsuit asks the court to rule whether the acquisition of 
skippers would violate the franchise agreement between the two 
pizza companies a hearing to determine whether an injunction should 
be issued is scheduled for thursday 
roger rydell a spokesman at pizza huts corporate headquarters 
in wichita said a 1984 amendment signed by the two companies 
reconfirms the franchise agreement requirement that national pizza 
limit its business activities to operation of pizza hut system 
restaurants 
we believe the proposed acquisition of skippers inc is in 
direct violation of our agreements with national pizza he said 
gene bicknell chairman of the board of national pizza co said 
pizza hut is trying to manipulate national pizzas future at the 
expense of its shareholders 
this investment in skippers by national pizza acquisition 
corp will have absolutely no effect on the ability of national 
pizza co to continue to operate as the largest and most successful 
pizza hut franchisee bicknell said 
the lawsuit asks for a ruling before the skippers tender offer 
expires on feb 28

trading today on the chicago board of trade amid rumors that the 
soviet union was seeking to buy 600000 metric tons of us wheat at 
subsidized prices 
other grain and soybean futures prices were mixed 
a large wheat purchase by the soviets would be the first 
significant grain export business in more than two weeks 
but analysts said the futures market had already largely 
discounted the potential soviet purchase which would be covered by 
the longterm grain agreement the soviet union signed with the 
united states late last year 
the minute they get the credit its automatically factored 
into the prices so this is not really a new factor in the market 
said cathy leow a grainmarket analyst with thomson mckinnon 
securities inc in new york 
in early trading wheat was unchanged to 2 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in march at 430 a bushel corn was cent 
lower to cent higher with march at 268 a bushel oats were 
unchanged to cent lower with march at 213 a bushel soybeans

after spending five months searching for a 
buyer the owners of john wanamaker and woodward amp lothrop have 
taken the department stores off the market 
officials for taubman investment co a michigan real estate 
firm said the company had decided the best option was to retain 
ownership in wanamaker and its sister company woodward amp lothrop of 
washington dc the owner said it would bring in fresh capital to 
pay for modernizing the stores 
taubman also announced the appointment of a new chairman and 
chief executive for the two department stores arnold h aronson a 
former head of saks fifth avenue 
wanamaker and woodies as the washington store is called were 
put up for sale in midseptember 
but only a handful of bids were made and taubman did not 
complete a proposed sale to kevin f donohoe a philadelphia real 
estate developer who emerged as the leading bidder 
bernard winograd president of taubman investment said tuesday 
the company concluded it was our best option to keep the stores 
i can only say that our thinking underwent an evolution 
he said 
under a recapitalization plan that is now in the works winograd 
said the taubman company would invest more money into the department 
stores to reduce their heavy debts aronson and other senior 
managers at the stores also intend to buy a small ownership interest 
in the stores 
much of it will be spent on the philadelphia stores we will 
continue the renovations underway at the philadelphia store and we 
also intend to get to the branch stores winograd said 
we intend to make major capital expenditures particularly with 
wanamakers which were very underspent under the previous 
ownership said aronson 
aronson 54 is a veteran retailer who late last year teamed with 
adler amp shaykin a new york buyout firm to submit a bid for 
wanamaker and woodies he will replace edwin k hoffman 66 who has 
announced his intention to retire this year after 11 years at the 
helm of woodies the change will become effective this week 
taubman bought woodies in 1984 and wanamaker on dec 31 1986 
together there are 32 stores with annual sales of more than 910 
million wanamaker a 128yearold company has 15 stores with sales 
of about 410 million and about 6000 employees 
the taubman firm based in bloomfield hills mich is headed by 
a alfred taubman who also owns sothebys auction house and a amp w 
restaurants 
sources said donohoes bid fell through because his principal 
financier general electric capital corp was jittery about whether 
the stores would be a secure investment in an uncertain retailing 
climate

operations of 1700 publicly held manufacturers it said there are 
990 usowned manufacturing multinationals with foreign assets of 
126 billion up from 884 in 1987 
in 1987 new york was home to 123 foreignaffiliated 
manufacturers and california had 108 
james greene an international trade specialist who compiled the 
data said the number of us multinational manufacturers has fallen 
from about 2000 in the late1970s 
since then many have been taken over by foreign firms others 
have been merged into larger multinationals and many have been 
privatized through leveraged buyouts he said these trends are 
likely to continue through the next few years concentrating 
usowned foreign assets in fewer and fewer corporate hands 
new york still has more multinational firms with annual sales of 
1 billion or more 44 compared with californias 24 but 
california has 66 multinationals with sales of 100 million or less 
compared with 34 in new york 
the report said californias electronics and computer companies 
have led to the increase in manufacturing multinationals many of 
which are establishing offshore production units especially in the 
far east 
after california and new york illinois had 85 multinational 
manufacturers ohio 70 massachusetts 61 pennsylvania 59 new 
jersey 57 connecticut 51 michigan 42 and texas 38

two former top officers of regina co pleaded 
guilty wednesday to defrauding investors in the troubled vacuum 
cleaner company of more than 100 million 
former regina chairman donald d sheelen and former chief 
financial officer vincent p golden told us district judge 
nicholas h politan they knowingly misled stockholders and the 
securities and exchange commission by falsifying company records 
this is a case representing massive misrepresentation by the 
company said us attorney samuel a alito jr at a news 
conference following the pleas it represents losses well in 
excess of 100 million by the investing public 
alito said sheelen instructed golden to falsify sales by not 
subtracting returned appliances from the companys income 
in an agreement reached with assistant us attorney gail h 
nichols the two men entered guilty pleas to mail fraud and 
securities fraud charges 
each could face five years in jail and 250000 in fines alito 
said restitution may also be sought 
the company released a revised financial statement in early 
january that said the companys net loss for the 15month period 
ending sept 30 1988 was 168 million on sales of 1903 million 
the company in september withdrew its initial financial 
statements showing a 109 million profit for the 12 months ended 
june 30 1988 on sales of 1811 million after calling them 
materially inaccurate 
peat marwick main amp co was hired to complete an audit at about 
the same time resignations were offered by sheelen and golden 
sheelen also the companys former president and chief executive 
officer owns 397 percent of reginas stock 
regina stock plunged in value last september after the company 
stunned analysts with a dour sales and earnings forecast regina 
shares which traded as high as 2750 a share in august 1988 
plunged to a low of 375 at the time on extremely heavy volume 
at midday wednesday regina was down 62 cents a share at 6 in 
national overthecounter trading 
analysts have said reginas past problems were linked partly to 
the quality of its housekeeper line of vacuum cleaners introduced 
about three years ago 
in 1984 sheelen and another executive took the company private 
in a leveraged buyout the next year regina went public at 1050 a 
share with a 2for1 stock split in 1987 
malcolm l sherman chairman and chief executive officer of the 
rahwaybased vacuum cleaner company said tuesday that regina would 
agree to be sold

despite american airlines recent 
selection of general electric co to power its fleet of new 
widebodied planes pratt amp whitney aircraft says it remains in the 
hunt to get a piece of americans widebody jetengine business 
american airlines announced tuesday it had signed an agreement 
with mcdonnell douglas co for up to 142 planes in a deal worth an 
estimated 7 million potentially one of the biggest aircraft orders 
in history 
at the same time american announced an agreement with ge to 
acquire up to 200 cf680c2 engines for use on most of its widebody 
jets 
the airline agreed to acquire at least eight new md11 widebody 
jetliners from mcdonnell with options to buy another 42 
its our understanding from american airlines that the first 
three or four md11 aircraft will have ge engines said robert 
weiss a spokesman for pratt amp whitney the east hartfordbased 
subsidiary of united technologies corp 
but american is telling us that the remaining 46 or 47 aircraft 
are still open to competition and we would compete vigorously for 
those aircraft with our pw4000 
industry analysts agreed that americans decision to go with ge 
for now was hardly a devastating blow for pratt amp whitney 
mark a bobbi an analyst with forecast international in newtown 
said that after a disappointing 1987 pratt amp whitney rebounded last 
year and dominated the widebody market with its pw4000 engine it 
won 16 of 20 competitions with firm orders and options worth about 
25 billion 
bobbi noted that american is already using ge engines on most of 
its widebody planes and probably stuck with ge because it wanted to 
standardize its fleet 
anytime you lose a competition of this type to a competitor 
its a blow he said i dont think pratt amp whitney really 
expected to win this one 
wolfgang demisch research director at ubs securities in new 
york noted that american merely took options on the 200 ge 
highthrust engines leaving the door open for pratt amp whitney to 
get part of the contract in the future 
for pratt obviously its a disappointment that they werent 
able to regain a leading slot with american widebodies demisch 
said 
in essence what american said is not yet they are 
basically keeping the door open he said 
american also announced that it had taken options on 100 md80s 
a smaller plane that is powered exclusively by pratts workhorse 
jt8d engines the value of the md80 buy to pratt would be as much 
as 750 million analysts said

for 60 years colgatepalmolive 
cos toothpastes have helped whiten south africans teeth now the 
us company wants to break ties with a town that has become a 
symbol of white racism 
a cordial corporate relationship with boksburg site of colgates 
large manufacturing complex soured in november after newly elected 
rightwing town councilors decided to resegegrate parks and other 
public facilities which had been open to all races under an earlier 
liberalization 
colgate joined other businesses in protesting the action and 
went one step further the company has requested its property be 
incorporated into the neighboring town of benoni so it no longer 
will pay taxes to boksburg 
the town councils actions are an insult to the dignity of our 
nonwhite workers and contrary to all human rights said gerry 
nocker colgates chief executive in south africa we cannot 
justify the payment of rates and taxes to a town council that has 
such backward views 
nocker a 47yearold native of scotland said about 750 people 
70 percent of them black or mixedrace work at the factory and pump 
roughly 6 million of annual wages into the local economy 
officials in benoni are studying colgates application if they 
formally endorse it a final decision would be made by the 
administrator of transvaal province 
the chemical workers industrial union which represents most of 
colgates black employees describes the company proposal as a 
public relations gesture that contrasts with a long and difficult 
relationship between management and workers 
but nocker says colgates opposition to south africas apartheid 
policies extends beyond criticism of the boksburg councilors he 
noted that the company financed a recent independent study of the 
group areas act which urged the abolition of laws mandating 
residential segregation 
the boksburg controversy marks the second time this year that 
colgate one of the biggest us multinationals has taken action 
over a racerelated issue outside the united states 
in january the company said it would change the name of its 
darkie toothpaste sold by a hong kong subsidiary in asia to 
darlie and substitute a picture of a grinning black minstrel on 
the tube to a nonracially offensive silhouette 
at colgates international headquarters in new york an executive 
said the companys influential position in boksburg has justified 
the decision to stay in south africa despite disinvestment pressure 
from antiapartheid activists about 175 us firms have pulled out 
since 1983 while 138 remain 
as long as we can make a noise and contribute to preventing 
this kind of retrogressive step then we think its very important 
that we and other american companies retain a presence there said 
gavin anderson director of executive services 
the conservative party councilors who took power in boksburg on 
oct 26 remain committed to whitesonly amenities despite a black 
consumer boycott that began in middecember and harsh criticism from 
business groups the press and the governing national party 
both the conservatives and antiapartheid politicians to the left 
of the national party have accused the government of hypocrisy 
noting that it has made no move to repeal the law that allows 
segregation of local facilities 
adrian botha executive director the american chamber of commerce 
in south africa said his organization supported colgates attempt 
to disavow boksburg but felt the government bore responsibility 
the conservative party is acting quite legally botha said 
the fault lies with people who introduced those laws 
anderson said colgate hadnt decided on its strategy if the 
benoni proposal fails but he indicated the factory is unlikely to 
be relocated 
ours is not a business like a shop that you can pick up and 
move to the next town he said 
colgate began marketing soaps shaving cream and toothpaste in 
south africa in 1929 opened a factory in east london in 1937 and 
moved in 1958 to boksburg about 15 miles east of johannesburg 
boksburgs town clerk johan coetsee said the council hadnt yet 
discussed the colgate application to be incorporated into benoni he 
said the maneuver could prove impossible partly because boksburg 
provides colgates factory with electricity water and sewage 
service 
the companys public affairs director sylvia hayward says 
colgate has been chipping away at apartheid through various 
programs including financial aid for aspiring black entrepreneurs 
multiracial private schools and a mobile denistry clinic 
assessing the boksburg controversy nocker said the town 
councilors are really turning the clock back i cant imagine the 
kind of thinking that goes on at those council meetings

patten corp a land company whose sales 
practices have stirred controversy has agreed to pay restitution to 
customers who can prove they were sold property under false 
pretenses according to proposed consent decrees filed wednesday in 
five northeast states 
the agreements which were scheduled to be released separately by 
officials in maine new hampshire vermont new york and 
massachusetts would end consumerfraud investigations into pattens 
activities in the five states and require patten to pay each state 
100000 
patten did not admit to any wrongdoing in the settlement and it 
was not immediately clear how much land or how many customers are 
involved 
maine attorney general james e tierney said maines interest was 
by far the largest of the five states 
this was no nickelanddime operation tierney said many 
scenic and recreational areas in maine were systematically acquired 
cut up for resale and marketed in highpressure campaigns that 
violated maine laws and preyed upon unsuspecting unknowing 
consumers 
patten brought the rogue morality of wall street to the woods 
of maine he said 
patten based in stamford conn said in a statement that it had 
cooperated fully and voluntarily with the state investigators 
many of the requirements in the agreements are already patten 
policy and the agreements will enable the company to further its 
policy of dealing fairly and quickly with customer complaints 
said the statement 
company president harry patten was quoted as saying while the 
company denies violating any consumer laws we believe the 
agreements serve the interests of the company its shareholders and 
customers 
the company said in reporting separately on its latest earnings 
results that it had taken a pretax deduction of 26 million to 
reserves which were set aside for anticipated expenses relating to 
the latest settlement as well as a tentative agreement in settlement 
of a previouslydisclosed dispute in pennsylvania 
the company believes that the amounts allocated to the reserves 
will cover all potential future costs relating to the two matters 
the statement said 
a complaint filed with the proposed settlement in superior court 
in augusta alleges that patten routinely lured customers many of 
them from other states by advertising property in rural maine at 
prices substantially lower than what was actually available 
the complaint also alleges patten misled prospective customers on 
numerous matters including the potential for building on the 
property and access to utilities roads and municipal services for 
example one unidentified buyer cited in the complaint was assured 
that utility service was available only to learn later that it 
would cost 23000 to bring electricity to the land 
under the pending maine consent decree which tierney said is 
virtually identical to those in the other states patten is required 
to make available a dispute resolution procedure to anyone who 
purchased land in the state or any resident who purchased land from 
patten between aug 1 1982 and may 1 1989 
people who can prove that patten misrepresented or omitted a 
material fact in selling the property will be entitled to full 
reimbursement including the purchase price interest taxes and 
closing costs 
customers who can show that they were forced to pay unreasonably 
high prices to improving the property because of similar 
misrepresentations are entitled to partial restitution under the 
agreement 
also any dispute that cannot be resolved within 45 days can be 
taken before the american arbitration assocation

the impact of disposable cigarette lighters 
on the wooden match business is painfully obvious to don bronikowski 
when the night shift arrives at the match plant where hes worked 
for 33 years 
we were geared up years ago to make matches until hell freezes 
over three shifts five days a week says bronikowski of diamond 
brands inc one of only two largescale wooden matchmakers left in 
the united states now were down to one shift five days a week 
so instead of cranking out the familiar strikeanywhere splints 
diamonds secondshift workers spend the night making corn dog 
sticks ice pop sticks toothpicks tongue depressors and other 
small products 
diamond and universal match co of kenner la the only other 
major wooden matchmaker in the united states survived the early 
1970s onslaught of disposable lighters by closing plants and 
consolidating manufacturing 
the growing popularity of electric stoves and foreignmade wooden 
matches also have taken away business but throwaway lighters took 
by far the biggest cut reducing the wooden matchs 50 percent 
market share to about 20 percent 
when bic and cricket lighters and all them came out they 
raised hell with the market said bronikowski 57 who is quality 
control manager our business just went down down down 
industry watchers estimate about 650 billion wooden matches are 
used annually in the united states lighters control about 65 
percent of the market while book matches and other sources account 
for the remainder bronikowski said 
from peak employment of about 450 in the 1950s when the cloquet 
plant made matches only the diamond workforce shrank to slightly 
more than 100 in the mid1970s 
at least seven wooden matchmakers have closed their doors in 
recent years bronikowski said 
universal a subsidiary of stockholmbased swedish match corp 
has closed a book match plant in hudson ny diamond has closed two 
plants in maine 
by consolidating diamond has equipped the cloquet plant to 
produce items such as corn dog sticks demand for which has 
skyrocketed because of the foods use in school hot lunch programs 
bronikowski said and nonmatch items now account for about half of 
the plants sales 
previous unsuccessful attempts to diversify included a 
chopsticksmaking venture in 1980 bronikowski said the plant 
couldnt meet the precise specifications of japanese buyers and 
aborted the operation in less than two years 
the successful diversification efforts have boosted employment at 
the cloquet plant some 15 miles west of duluth in northeastern 
minnesota to 325 from 160 in 1985 
most of the improvement at diamond has occurred in the past six 
years a period that included two ownership changes jefferson 
smurfit inc of alton ill bought the company in 1983 and sold it 
in october 1986 to st louis parkbased diamond brands a 
privatelyheld company 
irene rudnicki a plant supervisor who has been active in the 
employees union said the cloquet plant survived partly because the 
union agreed to major wage concessions for new employees about 60 
percent of the workers at cloquet are women and wages range from 
597 to 1060 an hour 
bronikowski said it takes about 75 minutes to convert ribbons of 
poplar into wooden matches and the plant makes about 60 million a 
day in addition to the large strikeanywhere variety the plant 
makes smaller penny matches that are struck against the box an 
average tree from the surrounding hillsides can produce about 11 
million matches he said 
unlike universal diamond doesnt manufacture book matches even 
though it sells them richard c jones universals national sales 
manager said the only other large scale us book match maker is 
dd bean co in jaffrey nh

soybean futures prices closed sharply lower 
wednesday on the chicago board of trade after soybean meal futures 
plummeted to 12week lows 
the break in soybean meal futures came in response to talk that 
us soybean meal producers were cutting cash prices by 2 to 4 per 
ton in a bid to stimulate demand analysts said 
soybean meal futures closed 3 to 570 lower with the contract 
for delivery in march at 23690 a ton 
the decline sparked rumors that the soviet union planned to 
cancel some of its purchases of us soybeans 
corn futures fell in sympathy with soybeans but wheat futures 
advanced slightly on rumors that the soviet union was seeking to 
purchase 600000 metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices 
under the longterm grain agreement signed late last year 
at the close wheat was cent to 1 cents higher with march at 
428 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 4 cents lower with march at 
263 a bushel oats were 4 cents to 5 cents lower with march at 
209 a bushel soybeans were 11 cents to 15 cents lower with march 
at 742 a bushel

fancier foods individual video machines and 
moneyback guarantees are among the amenities that big airlines are 
offering to firstclass fliers as competition for travelers 
increasingly highlights service instead of price 
the latest campaign was unveiled wednesday by british airways 
plc which said it is investing 40 million to upgrade its 
firstclass service on longhaul flights beginning march 1 
the changes detailed at a news conference in new york include 
individual passenger video terminals at each seat redesigned cabin 
interiors a new wine cellar and menus that allow passengers to eat 
when they wish 
this investment is a bold and calculated bid for commercial 
supremacy in an intensely competitive market said sir colin 
marshall the airlines chief executive 
the program reflects the increasing importance to many airlines 
of their firstclass business which accounts for nearly 400 
million of british airways annual revenue in the wake of years of 
fare wars that have made it tougher to compete for passengers on the 
basis of price 
this is especially true in the united states where airline 
industry deregulation has meant cheaper fares by all carriers 
making it harder to compete by slashing fares 
first class accounted for 103 percent of the revenue generated 
by major us airlines in 1988 compared with 9 percent in 1983 
according to the air transport association 
first class still isnt cheap british airways roundtrip 
firstclass fare between new york and london is 4880 compared 
with about 900 for an economyclass ticket 
but even continental airlines which long has had a reputation as 
a farecutting leader has reemphasized service the carrier last 
august tested a novel moneyback service guarantee for its 
firstclass passengers under which fliers could get a refund of up 
to 200 if they were dissatisfied with any aspect of their domestic 
flights from making reservations to claiming their baggage 
in western europe the gradual liberalization of the industry has 
spawned small independent airlines and some cheaper fares it also 
has increased the role of business class the service that falls 
between coach and first class 
business class generally offers hurried business travelers 
separate checkin facilities airport lounges with work areas and 
wider airplane seats while stopping short of such firstclass 
amenities as gourmet food 
business class sales have grown so strongly at scandinavian 
airline system that the company is scrapping its first class service 
entirely in favor of business and economy fares 
business class doesnt widely exist on domestic us flights but 
fastgrowing piedmont aviation has introduced a similar service 
targeted mainly at business travelers 
in june 1987 piedmont introduced firstclass service with all the 
trimmings at relatively cheaper fares charging firstclass 
passengers a premium over the economy fare of up to 60 one way 
depending on distance thats well below normal firstclass fares 
which often run about double domestic economy fares 
between dallas and miami for example piedmonts competitors 
charge 430 to 860 round trip for a regular economy ticket and 
1292 for firstclass service piedmonts economy fares are 
similar but it charges around 300 less for a firstclass round 
trip ticket 
usair group inc which is set to formally acquire piedmont in 
early august plans to adopt the same service 
there is a certain segment of the market that demands a 
firstclass product said mike clark a piedmont spokesman at the 
airlines winstonsalem nc headquarters 
another us airline offers nothing but first class the glitzy 
mgm grand air owned by california financier kirk kerkorian only 
flies between new york and los angeles for 1878 round trip 
what sort of people fly first class 
according to british airways they fall into two categories the 
patrician and the achiever the patrician has established 
wealth is relaxed but has exacting standards does not want to be 
overly pampered and chooses first class as a matter of course 
the achiever is usually a selfmade individual who is more 
status conscious is a conspicuous consumer seeks recognition and 
uses first class as a signal of accomplishment 
british airways says its new firstclass service is aimed mainly 
at business people predominantly male usually in their late 40s 
and holding to corporate positions such as chairman or chief 
executive 
in the united states much of the growth in firstclass traffic 
appears to have come from achiever business travelers who dont 
have a business class to fly in domestically 
furthermore many firstclass passengers are members of 
frequentflier programs who got upgrades to firstclass tickets as 
awards for accumulating mileage

crude futures prices slumped in light trading 
wednesday influenced partly by higher american petroleum institute 
statistics 
on the new york mercantile exchange the march contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude oil fell 21 
cents to close the day at 1749 a barrel the contract had risen 32 
cents in tuesdays session contracts for delivery later in the year 
also declined 
among refined products traded on the exchange the march contract 
for unleaded gasoline lost 032 cent to settle at 4894 cents while 
domestic heating oil declined 080 cent to 4907 cents a gallon 
other contract months also fell 
observers attributed the slide in prices to a combination of 
factors including a technical correction following several weeks of 
rising prices and the weekly api report 
the apis weekly statistics on domestic energy supplies showed 
crude oil stocks rose by 7 million barrels a day while unleaded 
gasoline increased 37 million barrels heating oil meanwhile 
declined 34 million barrels 
traders said some of the rise in crude oil stocks may be the 
lost opec oil that analysts have been looking for 
since the organization of petroleum exporting countries cut 
production jan 1 market analysts have looked for a weakening in 
oil prices as the excess oil produced by the cartel late last year 
entered the market 
instead prices have risen steadily surprising analysts and 
leaving many to wonder what happened to the excess oil 
opec was estimated to have produced more than 22 million barrels 
per day of oil at the end of 1988 on jan 1 it was to lower 
production to 185 million barrels although estimates are that it 
is producing more than 19 million 
nevertheless analysts have guessed that the excess was either on 
tankers en route to market in onshore storage tanks in the middle 
east or still in the ground 
energy traders said tuesdays api report suggests that the lost 
oil might finally be arriving on the market

the agriculture department reported wednesday 
that the nations flock of sheep and lambs increased slightly in 
1988 for the third consecutive year 
the increase was only a small fraction of 1 percent however 
boosting the us flock to an estimated 10802000 sheep and lambs 
on jan 1 from 10784000 on jan 1 1988 
despite the recent gains the jan 1 count was one of the 
smallest in us history according to department records going back 
for more than a century 
in 1970 for example there were 204 million sheep and lambs in 
the nations flocks and in 1867 when the department began counting 
sheep there were about 463 million head the industry peaked in 
1942 at 562 million 
primarily the decline stems from less demand for wool as more 
synthetics and cheaper substitute materials were introduced and the 
declining demand for lamb in consumer diets the report said 
also it said there has been increased difficulty in obtaining 
and keeping reliable herders to manage and care for range flocks 
and increased competing uses for publicowned rangeland 
predators including coyotes also are blamed for the decline in 
the us sheep industry 
the value of sheep and lambs as of jan 1 was estimated at 890 
million down 8 percent with the average at 8240 per head 
compared with 90 a year earlier

an agriculture department report pegging the nations cattle herd 
at 995 million head drew expressions of shock and amazement 
wednesday from market experts who had expected a much lower number 
analysts predicted cattle futures prices would drop sharply 
thursday in reaction to the cattle inventory report cattle futures 
settled narrowly mixed wednesday in cautious prereport trading 
on other markets wednesday soybean futures were down sharply 
precious metals advanced and energy futures retreated 
livestockmarket analysts had projected about a 14 percent net 
decline in the nations cattle herd during 1988 to 976 million 
head due in part to widespread herd liquidation as a result of the 
summer drought 
but the usda said the us cattle herd as of jan 1 was about the 
same size as it was a year earlier 
i was shocked said charles levitt senior livestock market 
analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in chicago 
analysts base their projections on previous usda cattle inventory 
reports which are released semiannually and on the daily 
slaughter numbers provided by packing houses 
one explanation for the surprising number could be found in the 
usdas contention that the number of calves born in 1988 was 2 
percent higher than the number born in 1987 
but even with the large calf crop the numbers are larger than 
we could possibly have pieced together using any balance sheet 
approach levitt said the only thing i can say at this point is 
that it appears we have a phantom herd out there 
thomas morgan president of sterling research corp in arlington 
heights ill said cattle futures traders had been faked out by 
the two previous cattle inventory reports which had set a pattern 
of declining cattle numbers that many had expected would continue 
although futures prices were expected to register an immediate 
reaction to the report morgan said the impact on beef prices would 
not be felt until late 1989 or early 1990 when the the calves born 
in the second half of 1988 are ready for slaughter 
in futures trading on the chicago mercantile exchange live 
cattle settled 30 cent lower to 40 cent higher with the contract 
for delivery in february at 7537 cents a pound feeder cattle were 
08 cent lower to 25 cent higher with march at 8442 cents a pound 
live hogs were 25 cent lower to 65 cent higher with february at 
4260 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 65 cent lower to 02 
cent higher with february at 3830 cents a pound 
soybean futures prices fell sharply on the chicago board of trade 
on rumors the soviet union planned to shift some of its purchases of 
us soybeans and soybean meal to south american producers 
corn futures fell in sympathy with soybeans but wheat futures 
advanced slightly on rumors that the soviets were seeking to 
purchase 600000 metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices 
under the longterm grain agreement signed late last year 
wheat settled cent to 1 cent higher with march at 428 a 
bushel corn was 1 cents to 3 cents lower with march at 264 a 
bushel oats were 3 cents to 5 cents lower with march at 209 a 
bushel soybeans were 9 cents to 11 cents lower with march at 
746 a bushel 
gold and silver futures strengthened on new yorks commodity 
exchange in reaction to the dollars decline against other major 
currencies 
gold settled 360 to 390 higher with april at 39910 a troy 
ounce silver was 55 cents to 59 cents higher with march at 5945 
a troy ounce 
energy futures prices drifted lower in dull trading on the new

the arctic cold wave that blew through 
california this week sent shivers through the states 
multimilliondollar floral and citrus industries ruining part of 
the lemon crop and possibly boosting the price of a valentine 
bouquet 
as the weather moderated in the states major growing regions 
wednesday growers assessed the coldcaused damage by slicing open 
lemons and eyeing rows of drooping carnations 
theres going to be a shortage right now theyre carnations 
just not blooming said mark yamaguchi a growershipper in 
monterey county 
many growers and packers said lemon groves in the san joaquin 
valley in central califronia were hit hard by the cold wave with 
some early estimates that 35 percent of the existing crop may have 
been damaged 
california is the nations top producer of lemons a crop valued 
at 152 million in 1987 it will take about a week to 10 days for an 
accurate assessment of the frosts damage industry experts said 
but prices already have risen for some crops the industrys 
wholesale price for a 40pound box of medium sized oranges jumped 1 
to 750 and a box of larger oranges also jumped 1 to 1050 said 
george lombardi marketing director for sequoia farms in exeter 
flower growers in san mateo and santa cruz counties already have 
seen the effect on their crops 
the damage is done the freeze has damaged the crops out there 
and i dont expect them to recover at all said george ginilo 
agriculture commissioner of central californias san mateo county 
the countys 1987 floral crop was valued at 165 million and serves 
wholesalers on the west coast and in new england 
but while some major suppliers of california flowers predicted a 
shortage it was unclear whether it would affect the market by 
valentines day yamaguchi said 80 percent of the national carnation 
market comes from foreign growers 
the california farm bureau federation said imports and greenhouse 
flowers should provide a tight but adequate supply of flowers 
for valentines day but said prices may be slightly higher in 
some cases 
daisies irises pom poms babys breath and other flowers grown 
in open fields may be in short supply even with the imports said 
the federations floriculture specialist maria sampanis 
growers were running greenhouse boilers were run around the clock 
for warmth and to encourage roses to bloom on time for feb 14 but 
half moon bay nursery owner natalie pastorino worried the flowers 
might bloom late this year 
were crossing our fingers that the cold weather ends said 
ms pastorino if we get the crop after valentines day well 
lose money because the demand is not there 
other crops lettuce carrots and broccoli sustained damage 
in monterrey county with up to 20 to 25 percent of plantings lost 
on some farms said richard nutter the county agricultural 
commissioner 
among citrus the icicles that hung from orange and lemons 
earlier this week in the san joaquin valley have melted and growers 
are waiting for signs of damage to appear 
citrus fares poorly when the temperature drops to 26 or lower for 
extended periods in central californias terra bella the prime 
region for tulare countys 357 million citrus crop temperatures 
stayed at 23 degrees or lower for 8 hours monday night and tuesday 
morning 
growers were more optimistic about the states 242 million navel 
orange crop which is fairly mature and contains a high sugar 
content that helps ward off frost 
in southern california cloud cover and winds prevented a heavy 
freeze and spared citrus flower and avocado crop from serious 
damage officials said but winds may have scarred or knocked some 
fruit from the trees 
also san bernardino countys 10 million orange crop suffered 25 
degree temperatures for 6 hours said john gardner assistant 
agricultural commissioner

argentinas national currency fell 
another 13 percent against the dollar wednesday continuing its 
slide in the wake of the governments decision not to stabilize the 
austral in foreign exchange 
at the close of business wednesday the dollar fetched 27 
australs compared to 2350 a day earlier and 1759 last friday 
some exchange houses were asking 29 to 30 australs to the dollar 
or simply bought and held dollars waiting for the price and thus 
their profits to rise further 
on tuesday when banks and foreign exchange houses opened 
following a oneday governmentordered holiday the australs value 
slid by 25 percent against the dollar 
the fluctuations follow the central banks announcement sunday 
evening that it no longer would intervene in foreign exchange to 
stabilize the austral a goal toward which it spent at least 1 
billion an estimated onequarter of its liquid reserves during 
the past several months 
by making 20 million to 30 million a day available to banks and 
foreign exchange houses and by supporting interest rates on 
financial instruments the government encouraged argentines to keep 
money in australs and in accounts that could be tapped for lending 
purposes 
the goal also was to dampen inflation which accelerated to 89 
percent in january and was 387 percent for 1988 by holding down the 
cost of imports and argentine products generally denominated in 
dollars such as apartments cars and airline tickets 
the bubble burst last week when argentines bought 486 million 
offered by the central bank even though interest rates on 
certificates of deposit and australdenominated financial 
instruments were hiked to near 20 percent a month 
the central bank was criticized by the opposition peronist party 
as using foreign exchange reserves built up partly by not making 
payments on argentinas 586 billion foreign debt for the 
political purpose of creating a favorable perception about the 
economy 
on wednesday as argentines with dollars went shopping in search 
of bargains before prices could be raised treasury secretary mario 
brodersohn denied rumors that central bank president jose luis 
machinea would resign 
he hasnt resigned and he wont resign brodersohn said

as a matter of policy we do not comment on rumors if there is 
anything to report we would tell our employees first said kodak 
spokesman paul allen 
kodak reported a profit of 312 million or 96 cents a share in 
the fourth quarter which ended dec 25 up from 242 million or 75 
cents a share a year earlier 
fourthquarter sales rose 29 percent to 454 billion from 352 
billion 
kodaks profit for 1988 rose 19 percent to a record 14 billion 
or 431 a share from 12 billion or 352 a share in 1987 
kodak sales rose 28 percent to a record 1703 billion for the 
year from 133 billion in 1987 
it was a good quarter and a good year said charles ryan a 
securities analyst with merrill lynch amp co in new york 
before the earnings report ryan had projected kodak earnings for 
1989 at 460 a share he now expects 470 a share 
the company posted 9 percent growth for the quarter and the year 
in domestic sales in its imaging segment which includes photographic 
film and paper and copier products ryan said that was more than 
double recent growth 
the results were boosted by the contribution of sterling drug 
co which kodak acquired in february 1988 
but allen said even if sterling drugs contributions were 
excluded the company would have established new sales and earnings 
records for the year

nissan motor corp on wednesday introduced the 
newest in its line of zcars a redesigned 300zx aimed at competing 
with porsche and other snazzy european sportscars 
nissan officials said new 300zx coupe to be in showrooms in 
april as a 1990 model is the fourthgeneration of the car 
originally introduced by datsun motor corp nissans ancestor in 
the fall of 1979 as the 240z 
nissan underwent a complete metamorphosis and the new zcar was 
developed katsuo yamada nissans general manager for product 
development told a news conference at the chicago auto show 
in redesigning the new zcar we were determined to return to 
its standard he said we received complaints from true sports 
car enthusiasts saying it had become just a sportylooking luxury 
car 
sales of zcars rose annually from the introduction of the 240z 
until 1979 when sales of the 280z reached 71983 cars sales later 
slipped to about 24000 last year 
bob thomas vice president and general manager of the nissan 
division of nissan motor corp in usa predicted that sales of 
the 300zx would total about 3000 a month or 36000 annually 
with the 300zx nissan eliminated all digital instrumentation 
replacing it with traditional dials and gauges the engine was 
beefed up to a 30liter v6 with 222 horsepower 17 more than the 
current 300zx 
the 1990 versions overall length is shorter than the 88s 
while the distance between its wheels has been increased and the 
car is narrower making it appear squattier than its predecessor 
thomas said the decision to stay with the 300zx name stemmed from 
the size of the engine 
we felt the car would stand on its own he said 
auto analyst ron glantz of montgomery securities inc in san 
francisco said there should be no confusion between the two cars 
despite the same name 
the market theyre going for is one that intimately knows what 
this car does he said its a very sophisticated market 
thomas said some of the 300zx buyers would be porsche shoppers 
along with others looking at european exotics such as jaguar 
and possibly mercedesbenz but he guessed that the bulk of 300zx 
buyers would come from curent or former zcar owners 
the coupe is to be introduced in april with an estimated base 
price in the middle or high 20000 range the 300zx fourseater is 
to be introduced in late july or early august and a turbocharged 
version will be available in the fall the price of the fourseater 
is expected to be slightly more than that for the coupe and the 
turbo will cost more than 30000 thomas said 
when it was introduced originally the 240z carried a base price 
of 3526 for a car with a 24liter inline sixcylinder engine 
it boasted 150 horsepower

the united states and the european economic 
community deadlocked wednesday in a new installment of the dispute 
over an eec ban on hormonetreated meat and us retaliatory 
measures 
many noneec countries at a council meeting of the 96nation 
general agreement on tariffs and trade warned of dangers posed by 
unilateral trade curbs with some criticizing the united states by 
name 
the councils regular session appeared to satisfy eec hopes for 
wide condemnation of the us countermeasures as a violation of 
gatts international trade rules although the common market did not 
demand a formal gatt inquiry into the dispute 
top eec and us trade officials are expected to discuss the 
issue when they meet feb 18 in brussels 
gatt director general arthur dunkel of switzerland told delegates 
the trade accord contained nothing which could justify 
discriminatory import tariffs as a retaliatory move 
eec delegate tran vanthinh said the united states action came 
without gatt authority he reiterated threats of eec 
counterretaliation against us imports unless washington withdraws 
its measures tran also said us policies endanger the global free 
trading system 
us envoy michael samuels said the meat hormones case was a 
small crisis and that settlement efforts are continuing 
he also stated the us position that scientific evidence does 
not suggest hormonetreated meat poses any health risks for european 
consumers the reason the eec cited in imposing its ban 
japan expressed concern about unilateral trade moves as did 
thailand switzerland argentina switzerland and pakistan and 
others 
the eecs import ban on hormonetreated meat took effect jan 1 
affecting us sales of beef and veal valued at more than 100 
million 
in response washington immediately slapped high duties on 
imports of european food products including boneless beef ham and 
pork shoulders 
eec foreign ministers on jan 23 then approved a plan to impose 
100 percent duties on imports of us walnuts and dried fruit but 
the ministers delayed implementation to give more time for 
settlement negotiations and said they would review the situation 
feb 20 before making a final decision on the matter 
the united states also came under pressure in other trade 
disputes 
brazil said it would demand a special council session to press 
for a gatt ruling on whether 100 percent us tariffs on brazilian 
drugs paper products and consumer electronics violate trade rules 
the united states imposed the sanctions last year because it said 
brazilian laws insufficiently protect foreign pharmaceutical patents 
samuels vetoed brazils second request for an investigation 
noting the new bush administration still is formulating its position 
on the case gatt traditionally operates by consensus 
brazil was supported by some 50 countries and a request for a 
meeting before the next regularly scheduled council march 8 appeared 
likely to be accepted 
in another case the united states blocked adoption of a report 
by gatt investigators which found parts of a us trade law 
discriminate against foreign companies in us patent infringement 
proceedings 
the eec had asked for the inquiry the report urges washington to 
bring its legislation into line with gatt rules 
but samuels said all delegations should study the complex report 
further before taking any action on it

a federal judge in a decision that 
effectively ends a sevenyear legal battle between two giant 
computer chip makers has ruled that microcodes can be protected by 
copyright 
us district judge william gray of los angeles ruled late 
tuesday in a suit between intel corp of santa clara calif and 
nec corp of japan 
gray settled a major aspect of the case in favor of intel 
upholding the companys contention that copyright protection extends 
to microcodes an intricate language embedded in computer chips 
although chip technology was already protected under copyright 
law that did not extend to hidden software such as microcodes 
the ruling is considered crucial to the success of the 16 
billion market for microprocessors protection of microcodes is 
viewed by analysts as a protection for us chipmakers against 
foreign competitors especially japanese companies 
the ruling cleared nec of the accusation that it illegally copied 
intels 8086 and 8088 model computers chips the chips are the key 
to the popular ibm personal computer and compatible systems 
im obviously pleased to win in any case especially this 
one said robert morrill an attorney representing nec this is 
going to be a significant case in computer copyright law and sets a 
nice balance between whats protectable and whats not 
intel lawyer f thomas dunlap called the ruling a broad 
landmark decision for the industry 
we now have a precedent that our large investments in new 
products such as the 386 microprocessor and future microprocessors 
can be protected under copyright law dunlap said 
gray said intels failure to ensure that a copyright mark be 
included on each chip made by several of its licensee companies 
meant it had forfeited it copyright on the 8086 and 8088 chips 
as a result of the decision these companies including nec may 
not be required to pay intel licensee fees to make the chips 
about 29 million ships were shipped by licensee without a 
copyright notice on them gray said 
the expensive legal battle began in 1982 when the two 
electronics giants that had once been partners began sparring the 
case went to court twice after the judge in the first case 
disqualified himself for owning a small amount of intel stock

a state court ruled against volkswagen of 
america inc wednesday in a major liability case reinstating 
damages awarded by a jury that found the company knowingly failed to 
correct defects in the audi 5000 
the threejudge appeals panel reinstated a 100000 punitive 
award to germaine gibbs of elizabeth nj who was injured along 
with her three children when an audi 5000 smashed through their 
apartment in 1983 and sent bricks raining down upon them the cars 
driver harold horowitz of elizabeth told police the automobile 
lunged forward suddenly 
ms gibbs attorney james hely said the ruling demonstrates 
audis liability in the case and may affect other cases pending 
against the west german automaker and its us subsidiaries 
because the truth comes out in this opinion about how they 
covered up and how they made a correction that was obvious they had 
to make it really reflects terribly on the company and how they 
handled this matter hely said 
a civil jury last march decided volkswagen was responsible for a 
design problem that placed the accelerator and brake pedal too close 
together in addition to the 100000 award the jury awarded ms 
gibbs 14000 in compensatory damages 
but superior court judge a donald mckenzie sided with company 
attorneys and set aside the higher award finding there was no proof 
volkswagen knew the car had problems and failed to correct them 
the appeals courts 16page decision reverses mckenzie 
while the evidence to support punitive damages was not 
overwhelming we are satisfied that a jury could reasonably have 
concluded that volkswagen was guilty of deliberate acts of omissions 
with knowledge of a high degree of probability of harm or reckless 
indifference to the consequences the court said 
in january ms gibbs asked the appellate division of superior 
court to reinstate the punitive award while volkswagen asked the 
appeals court to also set aside a 14000 award 
the company said the appeals court opinion is directed only at 
the lower court judges discretionary powers 
the appellate court apparently based its decision on the 
feeling that the judge in the lower court had abused his discretion 
we disagree with that said john bennett a spokesman for 
volkswagens us subsidiary in troy mich 
we feel the judge acted within his discretionary rights and we 
are looking very carefully to see what additional remedies we might 
have he said 
volkswagen told the national highway traffic and safety 
administration in 1983 that it would take corrective measures to 
prevent inadvertent activation of brake and gas pedals at the same 
time according to court papers hely filed in arguing the case 
last month 
internal volkswagen documents and a government report conclude 
the car would lunge when the accelerator and brake pedal were 
pressed simultaneously and the pedals were arranged close enough 
that the accelerator often is applied when the driver tries to 
brake hely said 
the documents show volkswagen knew as early as 1979 of the defect 
volkswagen declined to comment about the internal documents filed 
by hely saying they were not properly introduced as evidence 
bennett stressed that the case did not involve unintended 
acceleration which involves the car lunging forward uncontrollably 
when placed in gear 
but auto industry analyst david healy of drexel burnham lambert 
inc said the newest court ruling only adds to public relations 
problems for audi which suffered declining sales because of an 
unintended acceleration case it eventually won 
the monthly sales numbers for audis have been dismal since all 
of the publicity around the unintended acceleration arose last 
year healy said 
he said audis us sales were 60000 cars in 1986 41000 cars 
in 1987 and 23000 cars in 1988

a federal judge on wednesday rejected a request by 
eastern airlines management to block members of the machinists union 
from walking off the job in a dispute over mandatory overtime work 
the ruling by us district judge c clyde atkins followed 
shortlived walkouts tuesday and wednesday by groups of 
international association of machinist members wednesdays actions 
came as management and union officials met to resolve the dispute 
the federal court saw that there were two sides to this and 
gave us the opportunity to continue on harmoniously and try to work 
things out said charles bryan president of the unions miami 
local 
eastern said operations continued normally despite the 
controversy which boiled over tuesday afternoon in a walkout by up 
to 1000 machinists at miami international airport 
the job action lasted about three hours and management personnel 
replaced baggage handlers and other ground services workers two 
other small actions occurred wednesday morning 
i consider it a victory for eastern airlines said management 
attorney david ross after atkins rejected his request for a 
temporary injunction the union has admitted in open court that 
the work stoppages were illegal and they have promised the federal 
district judge that they will not do it again 
union leaders said they did not call for the walkouts and said 
they were spontaneous company spokesman robin matell blamed it on 
public posturing by the machinists whose 16monthold contract 
dispute with management has a march 3 deadline for settlement 
matell said the meeting wednesday continued discussions from 
tuesday on the suspensions for three days each of eight to 10 
machinists who refused to work overtime required by their contract 
the machinists said the company failed to show a need for the extra 
work 
this is a decision management interprets when there is a 
need matell said 
a union member said the strike was a spontaneous action from the 
rank and file crediting the pride of our workers with sparking 
the action 
the company demands from them they stay the overtime and they 
refused to do it they have to prove that they really need the 
overtime and they cant do that said orlando trujillo 
nobody has the right to require overtime in certain 
conditions said ronald orr district general chairman of 
machinists union 
we feel that if airplanes are grounded and delayed people have 
to work the overtime but if its not grounded and delayed the 
person has the right not to work it orr said 
union sources said baggage handlers started tuesdays walkout 
they would be particularly hard hit if eastern imposes its final 
contract offer calling for 150 million in cuts after the 
federally imposed 30day coolingoff period ends march 3 
no other airports were affected by the action and no flights were 
cancelled 
machinists locals around the country are voting this week on 
whether to authorize a strike if the march 3 deadline passes union 
officials expect overwhelming support for strike authorization 
the miami locals 4000 members will vote thursday mechanics 
make up about half of the 8500member union which includes more 
than a quarter of all eastern employees the other members are 
baggage handlers ramp agents and other ground services workers

isc systems corp a manufacturer of 
automated banking systems said wednesday it has agreed to be 
acquired italys olivetti in a 174 million deal 
isc systems said that after the takeover it would be merged with 
bunker ramo corp of shelton conn a wholly owned subsidiary of 
the office automation company ing c olivetti amp co of ivrea 
italy 
olivetti offered to buy all outstanding shares of isc common 
stock at 1225 per share in cash 
isc had announced in late january that it had agreed to be 
acquired at that price but did not disclose who the buyer would be 
the deal must still be approved by isc shareholders and federal 
regulatory agencies 
in national overthecounter trading isc rose 1 a share to 
1162 
the new company which will have headquarters in spokane would 
have had revenues of about 250 million in 1988 including iscs 
175 million 
this acquisition reinforces our worldwide position in banking 
automation vittorio cassoni olivettis managing director and 
chief operating officer said in a prepared statement it greatly 
expands our market share in north america complementing our leading 
role in europe and japan 
the new company would have the thirdlargest market share among 
firms selling automated financial services systems behind 
international business machines corp and ncr corp according to 
john lindeblad president and chief operating officer of isc systems 
about 25 percent of olivettis sales of more than 6 billion in 
1988 were to the banking industry but little of that was in the 
united states said ted demerritt isc systems chairman and chief 
executive officer 
analysts who follow isc systems said the merger offers a good fit 
of companies in both domestic and international markets 
daniel nelson an analyst with ragen mackenzie in seattle said 
olivetti could gain from iscs presence in asia while isc would get 
a toehold in the european market dominated by olivetti the 
spokanebased isc which has a large share of the domestic savings 
and loan market also stands to benefit from its association with 
bunker ramos commercial banking ties he said 
there are probably some synergies involved agreed dain 
bosworth analyst william whitlow in seattle they can take isc 
software and couple it with bunker ramo hardware and tie it all into 
olivetti mainframes its probably a better package and it gives 
olivetti a better product to market 
james d lindner president and chief executive officer of bunker 
ramo will become chairman and ceo of the asyet unnamed company 
iscs lindeblad will remain as president while demerritt will become 
vice chairman 
isc systems is a leading supplier of pinnacle branch automation 
systems to savings and loans credit unions and commercial banks in 
the us it also markets its products in latin america the united 
kingdom asia and canada 
bunker ramo supplies branch automation systems mostly to 
commercial banks 
isc systems announced dec 22 it would begin discussions with a 
possible suitor the announcement coincided with a restructuring 
that could eliminate as many as 120 jobs at its spokane operations 
where 750 people were employed as of jan 1 
demerritt said the merger will mean the loss of some jobs and 
reshuffling of others the reorganization announced before the 
merger will continue he said 
isc systems spokesman wes lynch said the program expected to be 
completed by june will result in a workforce of between 630650 
people 
isc was founded in 1977 and its products serve more than 2700 
financial institutions employing 1700 worldwide 
bunker ramo which employs about 600 people in the us was 
purchased by olivetti in 1986 its systems are found in 750 
financial institutions

president bush will propose more than 250 
million in education spending above former president reagans budget 
and will call for a special tax deduction of up to 3000perchild 
for adoptions administration and congressional sources said 
wednesday 
the sources who insisted upon anonymity said the 116 trillion 
spending plan bush will outline in a nationally televised speech to 
congress at 9 pm est thursday will project a deficit of roughly 
98 billion and even less if billions of dollars from proposed 
sales of assets are counted 
these sources said bush will blend his call for increases of a 
few billion dollars on items such as education aid to the homeless 
research and development and the environment thus redeeming 
pledges made in his 1988 campaign with an invitation to congress 
to negotiate over spending levels for dozens of other federal 
programs 
they said the president would recommend spending no more on those 
programs overall than in the current year as part of a socalled 
flexible freeze but would be willing to increase money for some 
while cutting others and keeping alive still others reagan targeted 
for extinction 
it was not immediately clear if that approach will satisfy 
majority democrats who have insisted that bush make the first 
comprehensive attempt at drafting a deficit reduction package before 
they would agree to negotiations but the republicans who were 
briefed on the plan by budget director richard darman said they were 
pleased with what they had heard 
the deficit estimate of roughly 98 billion falls within the 100 
billion requirement of a federal deficitreduction law for the 
fiscal year that begins oct 1 but some 55 billion higher than 
reagan had proposed 
higher levels in the bush budget for education child care the 
environment and the homeless account for some of the gap the 
sources said 
on the eve of bushs budget address more glimpses of the 
presidents 116 trillion spending outline surfaced as 
administration budget officials briefed influential members of 
congress on the package 
according to congressional and administration officials key 
elements of bushs package include 
a request for 250 million to 300 million more for education 
programs much of it for the head start program while formally part 
of the budget for the department of health and human services and 
not the education department for which reagan had asked 212 
billion head start provides preschool schooling for disadvantaged 
youngsters bushs plan for a 500 million national merit school 
program will be scaled back sharply however 
a tax break to help families recover some of the cost of 
adoptions with an emphasis on hardtoadopt children during his 
campaign bush repeatedly said he was for adoption not 
abortion a previous tax deduction of up to 1500 to help offset 
adoption costs was eliminated in a 1986 taxcode overhaul bushs 
proposal would restore and expand this tax break permitting a 
deduction of up to 3000 
an increase of about 350 million over the 14 billion reagan 
had sought to clean up deteriorating nuclear weapons plants along 
with a proposal to restart of the idled savannah river plant in 
south carolina 
the establishment of taxfree urban enterprise zones in 
inner cities details were unavailable 
a freeze in military spending at the level of inflation for 
fiscal 1990 with a 1 percent increase over inflation in 1991 and a 
2 percent increase in 1993 reagan had proposed a 2 percent 
increase after inflation for fiscal 1990 
the restoration of 17 billion reagan had sought to cut from 
the medicaid program of medical assistance to the poor but 
acceptance of reagans proposal for a 5 billion reduction in 
medicare assistance for the disabled and the elderly reagan had 
said his proposals would not cut benefits but would force the 
states and providers to become more efficient 
a reduction in the capitalgains tax to a maximum of 15 percent 
for assets held more than two years excluding works of art 
currently capital gains are taxed at the same rate as other income 
usually 28 percent or 33 percent 
a 1000 child care credit for lowincome families for each 
child up to age four current taxlaw provisions on childcare 
expenses would be unchanged 
a slight revision in economic assumptions to reflect a higher 
projection for shortterm interest rates in 1989 than the 63 
percent projected in the reagan budget 
republican leaders voiced enthusiasm over the forthcoming bush 
budget democrats mixed gestures of bipartisanship with expressions 
of skepticism 
sen pete domenici of new mexico senior republican on the 
senate budget committee predicted that bushs budget would be 
very alive on arrival 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said it was time 
for bush to come up with deed to match words 
were going to hold the president accountable to his words and 
we want to work with him he told a united auto workers conference 
sen bennett johnson dla said the bush budget would be an 
improvement over the reagan budget but would still be a 
disappointment you can be sure this budget will not make the 
hard choices 
one source who has been in a position to observe the budget 
process said the bush plan would embrace most of the programs 
outlined in the lameduck budget reagan presented last month bush 
modifications will comprise changes in only 30 to 40 out of 4000 
separate accounts the source said 
the source who requested anonymity said he expected bush to 
claim a revenue gain of 3 billion to 4 billion in the proposal to 
cut the capital gains tax bush will assert that the tax cut would 
also pick up revenues over the ensuing three years the source said 
an assumption that critics say is unlikely 
bushs intention to propose a lower tax on capital gains 
profits form the sale of stocks real estate and other assets drew 
sharp opposition wednesday from leading congressional democrats 
the house budget committee chairman rep leon panetta dcalif 
said he was very suspicious of asserting that cutting the 
capital gains tax would raise revenues especially in future years 
and the senate budget committee chairman sen james sasser 
dtenn said there was considerable skepticism about the impact 
of such an action on the treasury and on the economy as a whole 
a capital gains tax cut is not equitable it is a return to the 
kind of trickle down sophistry that was decisively discredited when 
the supplyside experiment failed earlier in this decade sasser 
said in a senate speech 
bushs 30year 200 billion savings and loan bailout plan would 
also cut projected fiscal 1990 expenses from the 21 billion reagan 
had proposed to about 19 billion by spreading out the costs of 
bailing out insolvent thrift insitutions 
the senate and house budget committees use bushs proposal to 
develop an overall spending and taxing blueprint setting goals 
other committees then transform the individual proposals into 
legislation authorizing any changes in programs needed to meet the 
goals the appropriations committees determine levels of funds to 
operate the programs and the tax panels handle any revenueraising 
measures the final congressional versions of the authorization 
appropriation and tax bills then go to bush for signature or veto

rockwell international corp maker 
of the b1b bomber has decided against resuming negotiations to buy 
ail systems inc maker of the bombers electronic defense gear the 
companys top executive said wednesday 
however rockwell may consider acquisitions to expand its current 
lines of aerospace electronics automotive and industrial products 
donald beall chairman and chief executive officer said at the 
annual shareholders meeting 
in january rockwell ended negotiations with clevelandbased 
eaton corp to buy ail a deer park ny company that makes the 
electronic countermeasures equipment for the supersonic air force 
bomber 
at the time the companies said the decision was made because 
eaton hadnt concluded a definitive contract with the air force for 
followup work on the system called the alq161 
the system is intended to counteract enemy radar and other 
electronic gear the air force says the bomber is fully operational 
but congressional critics maintain the alq161 isnt performing up 
to expectations 
beall told reporters that rockwell wouldnt resume negotiations 
to buy ail but would continue to work with the smaller company on 
the electronic countermeasures system 
beall didnt say if the pittsburghbased company had specific 
acquisition targets 
we would expect any acquisitions to be smaller businesses that 
offer product line and or geographic expansion potential he said 
beall said he expects the companys 1989 profit to exceed that in 
1988 when rockwell earned 8119 million on sales of 119 billion 
one reason he said is diversification into privatesector 
businesses government contracts including nasa business declined 
to 47 percent of rockwells business in 1988 from 58 percent in 
1987 and 64 percent in 1983 
the last of 100 b1b bombers was delivered to the air force in 
april 1988 and all that remains of the program is production of 
spare parts 
rockwell also is the prime contractor on the space shuttle and 
works on the strategic defense initiative or star wars among 
other programs

president bush has approved the foreign 
takeover of the last major us producer of silicon wafers the 
vital material used to make the computer chips in most electronic 
products 
the approval allows huels ag of west germany to take over 
monsanto electronic materials co of palo alto 
us companies now produce almost none of the silicon wafers made 
in the world while japanese companies provide 70 percent and 
european companies 26 percent of the worlds supply 
its real depressing said dan hutcheson president of vlsi 
research a san jose semiconductor research firm its another 
glaring sign that says our country is losing its technical 
capability and with it the ability to support our economy and 
defend ourselves in the future 
monsanto electronic is a division of monsanto co and is the 
worlds sixthlargest producer of silicon wafers 
the sale was announced last november and bushs approval of it 
tuesday did not come as a surprise the white house was assured that 
huels would keep the silicon supplier in the united states 
the sale was reviewed by an interagency government panel under 
the provisions of last years trade bill which empowers the 
president to block foreign acquisitions of us companies if the 
deals are thought to compromise national security 
the production of silicon is the first step in making computer 
chips silicon is usually refined to the desired level of purity 
formed into tubes sliced into disks and polished semiconductor 
makers then buy the wafers and cut them into chips for etching
