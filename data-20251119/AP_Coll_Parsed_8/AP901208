the environmental group greenpeace 
said it has found indications of radioactive material leaking from 
a french nuclear test site at mururoa in the south pacific 
greenpeace spokesman rick humphries said friday that initial 
tests outside the 12mile exclusion zone around mururoa atoll have 
found traces of radioactive cobalt 60 and caesium 134 in plankton 
humphries said greenpeace has invited scientists based at 
mururoa from frances atomic energy commission to discuss the 
results 
the presence of any artificial radioactivity as far as 12 
miles from the nuclear test site completely undermines frances 
claims that testing nuclear bombs under mururoa is safe 
greenpeace france president alain connan said there was no 
immediate reply from french scientists at the site

poland is considering mobilizing troops to 
battle a soviet invasion of refugees 
an official said friday that food shortages and worsening 
conditions in the soviet union could bring an influx of refugees 
the plans include the possibility of deploying troops on poands 
eastern border 
but col zbigniew skoczylas head of the new refugee bureau at 
the ministry of the interior called the use of troops a science 
fiction scenario 
poland which is also undergoing hardships while making the 
transition to a market economy predicts it could be swamped by up 
to 2 million soviets of polish origin mainly from ukraine and 
byelorussia 
if this horror was to happen poland would fall apart as a 
state as an economic system in two or three months said 
skoczylas 
travel restrictions for soviet citizens are scheduled to be

an effort by 107 nations to come up 
with new rules governing world trade was widely viewed as a crucial 
first test of global economic cooperation in the postcold war 
period 
but after five days of frustrating stalemate the delegates 
admitted failure friday and went home 
that defeat many fear could have farflung repercussions 
resulting in increasing trade frictions rising protectionism and 
possibly even an allout global trade war 
the trade negotiations known as the uruguay round for the 
country where the talks began in 1986 had been scheduled to wind 
up with five days of bargaining on a 291page document to govern 
trade flow between nations into the 21st century 
however the delegates never came close to agreement because of 
a fight between the united states and the 12nation european 
community over farm subsidies 
the talks are expected to resume in late january in geneva among 
lowerlevel negotiators 
the united states backed by australia brazil and other major 
farm exporters was seeking sharp reductions in subsidies the 
europeans claimed the us proposal would force more than 2 million 
of its 10 million farmers off the land 
at the end both sides bittery complained about the 
intransigence of the other 
us trade representative carla hills said that a compromise 
proposal put forward by sweden to break the impasse had been 
rejected by a few countries with substantial economic strength 
who were not prepared to negotiate fundamental agricultural 
reform 
in addition to the european community the united states 
expressed unhappiness with the intransigence of the japanese who 
were unwilling to open their closed rice market 
hills and other members of the us delegation said there would 
be no point to beginning negotiations in geneva until the european 
community showed more flexibility 
and the ec gave no hint of any change in its bargaining stance 
ec agriculture secretary ray macsharry of ireland said we have 
what we believe to be a very concrete proposal on the table 
officials conceded the dispute had put a strain on relations 
between the united states and some of its biggest trading partners 
the european community and japan 
there was speculation which hills did not rebut that the 
united states might begin taking a series of retaliatory actions 
against other countries based on charges that american companies 
were being kept out of foreign markets 
those disputes involved the japanese rice market and purchases 
of farm products including pork and beef in europe farm groups in 
the united states have already asked the administration to 
retaliate in these matters 
those petitions are on my desk and we will be assessing them 
under the law hills said we pledged when we took office to 
uphold the law 
if the us does retaliate against farm imports from europe and 
japan it would more than likely spark similar moves against 
american products 
some members of congress said the failure to reach an agreement 
is likely to swell protectionist sentiment in congress 
the us continues to be a leader of the world trading system 
but we can no longer afford to go it alone said house majority 
leader richard gephardt dmo one of the leading advocates of 
using retaliatory measures to force open foreign markets 
it is also likely the trade battle could spill over into other 
foreign policy concerns just as the united states is counting on a 
unified front in the campaign to force iraq from kuwait 
the trade talks are being held under the auspices of the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade the organization charged with 
policing international trade rules 
in recent years the gatt rules have been swamped by economic 
events trade in important areas such as agriculture textiles and 
the fastgrowing service industries of banking and the like are not 
even covered by gatt 
to correct these problems the united states had pushed an 
ambitious agenda seeking to include the 1 trillion in world trade 
not now covered by gatt rules 
the freer markets expected to result would expand export 
opportunities for us businesses and farmers and thus help to 
lower americans trade deficit still stuck at around 100 billion 
a year

the united states will speed millions of 
dollars in military aid to el salvador to combat leftist guerrillas 
said to have used computeraided soviet missiles to shoot down two 
salvadoran warplanes 
bush administration officials said a spent canister from an 
advanced sovietmade a14 surfacetoair missile has been found 
near the area where one of the aircraft was destroyed 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said friday that 
the 481 million in aid approved by secretary of state james a 
baker iii will allow the salvadoran government to replace 
equipment including planes damaged or destroyed in the rebel 
attacks that began nov 20 
the attacks have caused some 500 casualties in seven of the 
central american countrys 14 provinces officials said adding 
that the dead and injured include government troops fmln 
guerrillas and salvadoran civilians 
the administration officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the rebels used a surfacetoair missile 
apparently an a14 to shoot down a salvadoran a37 fighterbomber 
on nov 23 
a guerrilla missile also destroyed an ac47 gunship plane on 
tuesday they said 
the officials said it had been known at the time of an fmln 
offensive last year that the rebels had received a7 surfacetoair 
missiles and possibly americanmade redeye missiles as well 
the officials said they now have evidence that the guerrillas 
have obtained and are using sophisticated computerguided a14 
missiles a weapon with longer range and greater capability than 
the a7 
it would appear that the fmln have recently introduced into el 
salvador a new very sophisticated generation of surfacetoair 
missiles one official said referring to the a14 
the officials said a canister from a soviet a14 missile was 
found in approximately the same location in eastern el salvador 
where the a37 was shot down 
one official said a14 missiles are known to exist in the 
western hemisphere only in nicaragua whose armed forces are under 
the control of leftist sandinistas and in cuba 
salvadoran forces discovered 24 sa7 missiles and one us 
redeye in a small plane that crashed in el salvador last year 
the official said that flight originated in nicaragua and was 
organized by cuba and the sandinistas he said the redeye could 
have been captured by the sandinistas from the nowdisbanded contra 
rebel force in nicaragua 
he noted that the salvadoran guerillas recently have claimed 
publicly that they now possess a7 a14 and redeye missiles 
we have information arms shipments do continue from nicaragua 
both by land and by sea the official said 
but he said he is confident they are being organized without the 
assistance or knowledge of nicaraguas democratically elected 
president violeta chamorro 
of the 481 million total in aid 106 million will come from 
money left from the 81 million congress appropriated for the 
salvadoran armed forces in fiscal 1990 which ended sept 30 the 
remaining 375 million will be drawn from the 85 million 
appropriated for the current fiscal year 
under conditions imposed by congress the final half of the 
current years appropriation can be released only if the guerrillas 
launch an offensive that threatens the survival of the salvadoran 
government 
ms tutwiler the state department spokeswoman said the money 
was intended to help the government of el salvador face the 
serious new escalation in fmln guerrilla offensive actions 
she said the administration will continue to review the 
offensive including its use of surfacetoair missiles to 
determine whether additional military assistance withheld and 
conditioned by congress should be released

a genetically engineered hormone that forces 
cows to give more milk and calves to grow faster poses no health 
hazard to humans who eat the products from treated herds a 
government committee concludes 
the panels findings were announced friday at a news conference 
that was interrupted repeatdly by protestors who shouted questions 
and attempted to make speeches about the hormone called 
recombinant bovine somatotropin or bst 
dr melvin m grumbach of san francisco chairman of the 
13member committee convened by the national institutes of health 
said that following three days of intensive review of research on 
the hormone the panel agreed unanimously that milk and meat from 
bsttreated cows is safe for humans 
the committee also decided however that more research was 
needed to determine the effects of the hormone on a dairy cow 
disorder and to search for possible effects on the human digestive 
tract of a tiny elevation of a growth factor in the stimulated 
milk 
this is absurd one protestor shouted how can you say it 
is safe and then that you need more studies 
grumbach a pediatrics professor at the university of 
california said the committee was confident that bst could safely 
be used in dairy herds 
the evidence clearly indicates that the overall composition 
and nutritional quality of milk and meat from bsttreated cows is 
equal to that from untreated cows he said 
following the announcement a questionandanswer session for 
reporters was repeatedly interrupted by two longtime opponents of 
bst jeremy rifkin of the foundation on economic trends and samuel 
epstein of the university of illinois 
recombinant bst is a manufactured version of a naturally 
occurring hormone in cows scientists have known for decades that 
shots of the natural hormone causes cows to increase milk 
production by up to 15 percent and forces faster growth in young 
calves there has been only rare use of the natural hormone in the 
dairy industry however because of its high cost 
in recent years several drug companies have used genetic 
engineering to produce a form of bst and have determined that the 
hormone can be made cheaply enough to be of practical use the 
firms have asked the food and drug administration to approve the 
manufactured hormone for use in dairy herds 
opponents contend that meat and milk from cattle injected with 
the manufactured bst will have higher levels of insulinlike growth 
factor or igf1 and that it will lead to wider use of antibiotics 
in dairy cattle 
rifkin and epstein also argue that bst will cause cattle to have 
increased incidence of mastitis an inflammation of the udder and 
have reproduction problems 
the committee recommended research to evaluate the mastitis 
connection but it said the hormone does not appear to affect 
appreciably the general health of dairy cows 
the panel which included two veterinarians and a dairy farmer 
said research shows the levels of igf1 in milk from bsttreated 
cows would double but that even with the increase the amounts are 
too small to have an effect on most humans 
dr raymond l hintz a pediatrician from stanford university 
said adult human saliva normally contains igf1 at a much higher 
concentration than is found in bsttreated milk he noted that igf1 
is a protein that is normally metabolized by the intestines in 
humans and does not enter the bloodstream 
hintz said there was some slight concern by the panel that the 
increased igf1 could have some effect on newborn babies the 
committee called for research to examine the igf1 effects on the 
upper gastrointestinal tract particularly the esophagus in 
newborns 
grumbach acknowleged that the fda did not give the panel 
information from an ongoing study of bst used on 20000 diary cows 
he said that when the study is completed the committees 
conclusion regarding animal health may have to be modified 
committee members also conceded under questioning that most of 
the data studied came from companies that manufacture bst or from 
investigators whose work is financed by industry 
dr david rush a professor of nutrition at tufts university 
said companies pay millions to underwrite the research in hopes of 
getting government approval to sell the hormone 
thats the american system he said

sears led the way as retailers nationwide 
slashed prices and launched big advertising campaigns in hopes of 
brightening what looks to be a gloomy christmas shopping season 
sears roebuck and co began an aggressive nationwide television 
and radio drive thursday night promoting steep markdowns on 
clothing and incentives like nointerest financing on major 
appliances 
the company is advertising afterchristmas prices just in time 
for christmas 
sears and other big national retailers announced thursday that 
their sales fell in november from last years levels as consumers 
translated worries about the economy and the middle east into 
reduced holiday spending 
as christmas nears storeowners are growing nervous 
we looked at the trends through the end of november and have 
anticipated those trends would continue matthew howard sears 
senior vice president for marketing said friday 
sears is advancing by several weeks planned markdowns on winter 
clothes particularly coats warmer weather in many parts of the 
country has stalled winter clothing sales 
howard said sears is trying to boost its flagging sales of 
bigticket items by waiving interest charges on major appliances 
and home electronics items between now and march 
appliances furniture and other expensive merchandise has been 
hit the hardest by the drop in consumer spending that began as the 
economy slowed and worsened after iraq invaded kuwait in august 
jc penney co inc has also marked down prices but unlike 
sears it is not instituting a companywide program spokesman 
duncan muir said friday 
in markets where business is slow therell be more 
promotions muir said noting that sales have been particularly 
sluggish in the northeast 
janet mangano an analyst with jesup josephthal amp co inc 
said more sale signs will appear if business does not soon 
improve 
next week is it they wont be able to hold out if sales do 
not pick up she said 
muir said penney would decide price reductions on a daybyday 
basis especially when youre in this critical time 
although customers in many stores have been seeing price 
reductions all along most were planned in advance retailers who 
normally expect to make half their annual profits at christmas 
have resisted taking bigger cuts because of the devastating effect 
such cuts can have on their balance sheets 
the latest reductions should not hurt sears earnings howard 
said 
the 20 percent to 40 percent markdowns on clothing are less than 
the 30 percent to 50 percent reductions that would have been posted 
later in the month although more merchandise is affected now 
many retailers expect business to improve in the 10 days before 
christmas and hope for a big weekend right before the 25th which 
falls on a tuesday 
they want to avoid the severe price cuts that made for a 
disastrous christmas for some companies last year but consumers 
besides being more budget conscious this year have learned that 
they may get better prices if they postpone their shopping until 
the last minute 
rh macy amp co inc hit hard by markdowns last year has made 
fewer reductions this season and does not expect to change its 
strategy said spokesman james fingeroth 
on thursday sears said november sales at its stores open at 
least a year fell 24 percent from a year ago while the companys 
overall sales slipped 16 percent

top us trade officials regularly represent 
overseas interests after leaving public service and some 
government trade advisers are also registered as foreign agents a 
private study says 
but an ethics officer for the office of the us trade 
representative denied such conflict of interest among the agencys 
unpaid advisers and said a new law taking effect next month will 
prohibit quick switchovers in jobs 
the 90000word report which profiles 74 current and former 
senior officers of the agency said 47 percent of past ustr 
officials either went to work for businesses registered with the 
justice department as foreign agents or were registered as foreign 
agents themselves 
others worked for foreign interests but failed to register under 
inadequate laws said the report released friday by the center for 
public integrity 
the report said the ustr office which conducts trade 
negotiations with other nations has become a training ground for 
foreign lobbyists 
center director charles lewis said the agency has some of the 
besteducated most competent people in the federal government but 
he said too many of its highest officials go on to work for some of 
american industrys toughest competitors 
the yearold center is financed by foundations labor unions 
news media clients and other companies including some that would 
benefit from freer trade 
i dont think any of us expected there to be so many of 
americas best and brightest men and women in the most important 
us trade policy positions later going to work for this countrys 
economic adversaries lewis said at a news conference 
he added that the report uncovered no illegal activity or 
lackluster performance by trade officials in negotiations with 
companies they or their firms later represented 
barbara gordon ethics officer for the ustr general counsels 
office said the agency headed by carla a hills is cautious about 
possible conflicts but that former officials are not now bound by 
its strict standards of conduct 
a law to take effect in january will prohibit any highlevel 
government official from going to work for a foreign entity within 
one year of leaving public service 
the report identified washington attorney richard fairbanks as a 
trade office adviser whose law firm represented iraq for four 
years fairbanks office said the firm had not represented the 
middle eastern nation since march five months before iraq took 
over kuwait 
we know of no instance where an adviser did or could have used 
his or her position as an adviser to the benefit of a foreign 
interest client or to the detriment of the united states ms 
gordon told a reporter 
she said the trade office was aware that fairbanks firm had 
represented iraq but the law firm did not handle trade matters 
the unpaid advisers serve on panels of 30 to 150 people who report 
by consensus and thus no one person affects decisions alone ms 
gordon said 
the report lists former trade representatives william eberle and 
william brock as among officials whose firms have worked for 
foreign governments or companies 
eberles company manchester associates has advised and lobbied 
for nissan motor corp of japan since the late 1970s and the brock 
group has done work for the government of taiwan toyota and airbus 
industries the study said 
manchester president john moller said eberle who is the firms 
chairman did not do any work for nissan until five years after he 
left the trade post in 1974 but moller said the groups study 
raises questions about former government officials that probably 
need to be addressed 
brocks secretary said he was in brussels and unavailable for 
comment 
lewis in releasing the report said it is jarring evidence 
that america has lost public service as an ideal 
we do not expect american arms control negotiators to quit 
government and go to work for the soviets we do not expect 
american generals to leave government and go to work for iraq he 
said 
and americans do not expect top us trade officials to leave 
government and go to work for those companies and governments which 
are actively competing against the us in the world marketplace

the nations pharmacists are being asked by 
the food and drug administration to make sure they are not making 
and selling impure compounds and solutions 
in a letter sent to pharmacists this week the fda cited two 
recent incidences of contamination in which four people died and 
two lost sight in one eye 
the fdas correspondence issued a strong reminder to 
pharmacists that they must follow standard manufacturing controls 
to ensure sterility of the drugs they make 
the agency has been investigating pharmacies that do a 
substantial amount of work preparing special mixtures compounds 
and solutions for hospitals and consumers spokesman william grigg 
said friday 
though pharmacists generally are regulated by the states when 
they make a drug they must follow the same federally required 
procedures the food and drug administrations good 
manufacturing practices rules imposed on drug companies 
if pharmacists do not follow these practices they could be 
subject to the same sanctions as drug companies which can include 
product seizures fines and criminal prosecution grigg said 
the two instances in which contaminated solutions caused 
infections resulted from incorrect production methods by 
pharmacies the agency said 
the fda said in the letter that it has determined that other 
pharmacies are also using incorrect procedures and controls for the 
batch production of drug products intended to be sterile 
some pharmacies also are packaging nonpreserved sterile 
solutions in multiple dose containers which the fda called 
unacceptable 
these matters are of serious concern to the fda the agency 
said 
the american pharmaceutical association a trade association for 
pharmacists said the fdas warning was appropriate 
were concerned about people making sure they take 
precautions to prevent contamination of sterilized products said 
arthur kibbe senior director for pharmacy affairs for the 
association the agency was correct in reminding everybody of 
it 
in the most recent contamination cases two women lost an eye 
and at least 10 others were treated forserious eye infections last 
month after using bacteriacontaminated drops made by a pharmacy in 
pittsburgh 
in lincoln neb four patients died after being exposed to a 
tainted solution used in open heart surgery at bryan memorial 
hospital last may and june the solution was mixed at the hospital 
pharmacy 
many of the pharmacies that make drug products in batches are 
those in hospitals and nursing homes and most of that work is in 
mixing intravenous solutions kibbe said 
most community pharmacists spend their time filling individual 
prescriptions for standard medications however they sometimes 
will be called upon to combine different medications into a single 
solution or a capsule he said

the united states wary of angering 
israel has apparently backed away from its earlier support for a 
un resolution that would call for an eventual international 
conference on the middle east 
the un security councils president ambassador abdalla saleh 
alashtal of yemen said friday i am very disappointed we 
thought after six weeks we had come to a consensus 
alashtal said the talks broke down over us insistence that 
the endorsement of a future peace conference be removed from the 
resolution 
after backing such an idea wednesday us officials had issued 
a flurry of denials they meant in any way to meet iraqs 
preconditions for a persian gulf settlement 
president saddam hussein has demanded an international effort to 
solve the israeliarab conflict as part of any gulf accord us 
officials have said there can be no linkage of the two disputes 
a meeting of the un security council on the proposed 
resolution was expected this evening even though the diplomatic 
talks fell apart friday the american ambassador to the united 
nations and the state department were still struggling to work out 
some way to avoid casting a veto 
a veto is apt to upset americas arab allies in the 
multinational force opposing iraq 
complicating the problem was a scheduled meeting today between 
us ambassador thomas r pickering and premier yitzhak shamir of 
israel 
the israeli leader who is visiting the united states said 
thursday that israel still opposes any international conference on 
the middle east shamir who is also scheduled to confer with 
president bush on tuesday said he will seek clarification on the 
us stand during his meetings 
the us mission to the united nations was in a particularly 
tough spot because it argued forcefully last week for the un 
resolution that authorized use of force if iraq fails to leave 
kuwait by jan 15 
it suggested that other nations not jeopardize a quick 
resolution on that issue by campaigning for the israeliarab 
declaration at the same time 
as a result a senior us diplomat said privately some nations 
would have every right to feel betrayed if the united states 
didnt go along with any widely accepted mideast resolution this 
week 
talks on the new resolution went sour late friday between 
pickering and the nonaligned nations 
malaysian ambassador razali ismail who represents the seven 
nonaligned nations on the 15member council said after a series 
of meetings with pickering it appears that the talks cannot go 
any further 
when asked if the united states would veto the resolution 
ismail replied that seems to be their national position 
diplomats said the united states was pushing for removal of 
language endorsing a peace conference at the appropriate time 
bt the nonaligned nations insisted it be left in 
us policy has long called for a middle east peace conference 
at some appropriate time in the future but the united states had 
previously blocked the security council from adding its voice in 
favor of such a plan

members of congress are protesting a reported 
attempt by white house chief of staff john sununu to block the 
reappointment of a top banking regulator faulted for being too 
tough 
sununu blames comptroller of the currency robert l clarke for 
creating the socalled credit crunch gripping the northeast 
government and industry sources said friday 
clarkes fiveyear term expired dec 2 he continues in office 
until a successor is appointed the comptroller is responsible for 
overseeing nationally chartered banks and reports to the treasury 
secretary 
bankers and borrowers have complained for a year that clarkes 
examiners have overreacted to the savings and loan crisis and are 
deepening the economic downturn by discouraging bankers from making 
even good loans 
new hampshire where sununu was governor has been one of the 
states hardest hit by the crackdown 
according to one source who demanded anonymity a group of 
large contributors to the republican party wrote to president bush 
urging him not to reappoint clarke 
within the last week white house aides have been calling 
bankers and business executives asking pointed questions about 
clarke another source said 
however members of the house banking committee are strongly 
defending clarke 
in my view bank regulators can never be too tough and 
clarke has been strong and tough rep frank annunzio dill 
said in a letter to bush it must be remembered the 
underlying importance of his job is to protect the american 
taxpayers from having to bail out the banking system 
if theres any lesson of the sampl debacle it is that financial 
institutions that dont recognize their losses early are going to 
be greater liabilities later said rep jim leach riowa 
clarke has properly been attempting to shore up commercial banks 
balance sheets 
rep charles schumer dny said it simply sends the wrong 
signal to sack the man who has stood for sound banking 
regulation 
schumer and two other members of the banking committee chairman 
henry b gonzalez dtexas and rep doug barnard dga also 
expressed their concerns in a letter to bush making a scapegoat 
of the nations chief national bank regulator only weakens 
regulation of depository institutions and does nothing to solve the 
problems of credit availability they wrote 
clarke and other regulators maintain they have not tightened 
regulation inappropriately they blame banks reluctance to lend on 
deteriorating real estate markets and on a lack of demand resulting 
from the sluggish economy 
one of the difficulties really is that there arent enough 
good loans out there particularly in certain areas and 
particularly in real estate l william seidman chairman of the 
federal deposit insurance corp told reporters friday 
seidman who himself has been pressed by sununu since may to 
leave office before his term expires in october said i did 
welcome bob to the club this morning 
clarke and aides to sununu did not immediately return telephone 
calls seeking comment 
sununus push to oust clarke comes amid rising concern that a 
growing mountain of sour commercial real estate loans will bankrupt 
the government insurance fund that protects bank deposits 
three private economists are preparing a study for a 
subcommittee headed by annunzio they are expected to warn the fund 
eventually could need a taxpayer bailout 
until recently clarkes reappointment seemed all but certain 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady was supporting him albeit 
without a lot of enthusiasm according to the sources

bored homesick sailors break 
the monotony of persian gulf patrols with spending sprees in dubai 
and they do it for a song 
american and british sailors from the multinational naval armada 
flock to shops in the united arab emirates on shore leave buying 
armloads of cheap pirated music cassettes and videotapes 
the sailors arent fussy and buy lots of cassettes said 
ishwar daryanani owner of the sound of space shop in dubai 
knock on wood were doing better than normal during these crisis 
months 
shops that before iraqi invasion of kuwait on aug 2 sold an 
average of about five cassettes a day now sell about 60 a day 
shop owners say many sailors buy about 15 tapes at a time but 
some leave with as many as 40 packed away in special carrying 
cases 
tapes that usually cost about 10 aboard ship or abroad sell for 
just over 1 in dubai where lax copyright laws allow companies 
such as daryananis to pirate music cassettes and videotapes 
shop owners say most of the american sailors opt for tapes of 
mc hammer prince or sybil but they also buy a lot madonna and 
george michael or mixed cassettes called hot black ninety and 
best in black 
the british tend to buy more phil collins roxette and elton 
john 
i found quite a good collection of christmas carols said 
wayne johnson of montgomery ala assistant to the chaplin aboard 
an american warship 
pirated videotapes also widely available in dubai sell for as 
little as 10 for copies of some of the latest releases from the 
united states and europe 
diryanani said the topselling video titles are die hard 2 
total recall another 48 hours the hunt for red 
october and dick tracy 
he said other favorites include air america and born on 
the fourth of july two films based on the vietnam war 
about a year ago the united states began a drive to get the 
united arab emirates to close the loopholes that allow firms such 
as daryananis to pirate the tapes and export thousands to such 
countries as uganda and kenya 
so far the effort has been unsuccessful and the illicit tape 
market continues to flourish 
still despite the crisisrelated boom in tape sales some 
merchants lament other missed opportunities 
ive had several customers ask for copies of the madonna and 
sylvester stallone posters that i have posted on my wall said s 
saju of the moonlight cassette shop 
but unfortunately i didnt stock such posters because usually 
theres no demand for them here saju said

nasa has another opportunity to show why it 
shouldnt be forced to release the taped conversations of 
astronauts aboard the space shuttle challenger moments before it 
exploded 
in a 65 ruling friday a bitterly divided federal appeals court 
held that a lower court erred in ordering the release of the tape 
without balancing the public interest against the harm of invading 
the privacy of the seven astronauts and their survivors 
the decision by the us circuit court of appeals for the 
district of columbia sends the case back to us district judge 
norma holloway johnson who had ordered the national aeronautics 
and space administration in 1987 to release the tapes to the new 
york times 
the appeals court majority said nasa is entitled to an 
opportunity to prove its claim that release of the tape would 
invade the privacy of the deceased astronats of their families 
the ruling reversed both the original district court opinion and 
a 1988 holding by a split threejudge panel of the appeals court 
that had upheld the release of the tapes 
the dispute goes back to a lawsuit the times filed under the 
freedom of information act seeking release of the tapes of cockpit 
conversations after liftoff just moments before challenger 
exploded 
all seven astronauts died in the jan 28 1986 explosion 
nasa released a written transcript of the conversations but the 
newspaper contended that an analysis of the audio tapes might help 
determine what caused the tragedy

an international womens forum study that 
concluded female managers lead differently than men does not 
contribute to sexual stereotypes its sponsors say 
the study said women to a greater extent than men manage by 
personal interaction with their subordinates it says men are more 
likely to manage on a more authoritarian rewardandpunishment 
system 
we are not blaming them we are not saying its better or 
worse we are just saying its different judy b rosener a 
professor in the graduate school of management at the university of 
california in irvine said at a friday news conference 
the study was based on responses from 355 members of the forum 
an organization of prominent women leaders in 16 countries and 101 
men in similar positions 
it says the typical woman surveyed prefers the use of personal 
power that is power based on her charisma work record and 
contact as contrasted with structural power based on the authority 
that comes with organizational position title and the ability to 
reward and punish 
cynthia maduro ryan a washington lawyer and former corporate 
executive who is president of the iwf said we are not here in any 
way to discredit the command and control or authoritarian style 
it was basically appropriate and well done for purposes of the 
industrial era she said 
ms rosener said she has received about a hundred telephone 
calls about the study since her article on its findings appeared in 
the novemberdecember issue of the harvard business review 
people are saying gender has nothing to do with it you are 
really enforcing gender stereotypes she said 
but she said we are no saying that all women behave one way 
and all men behave another way

us and british hostages say theyll be 
leaving iraq with a deep feeling of good fortune and maybe a new 
outlook on life 
if you have your hands in the meat grinder and if you get them 
out in one piece how would you feel said garry carr an 
oilworker from fort worth texas 
carr was among 50 to 60 american and british hostages and their 
wives who gathered at a baghdad hotel friday to sip beer and 
celebrate their promised freedom 
the celebration followed a vote by iraqs parliament earlier 
that day to endorse presieent saddam husseins call to release all 
foreigners trapped in iraq and occupied kuwait since iraqs aug 2 
invasion

adversity said chris mayer 24 of england who was held as a

selfexamination period said robert vinton 58 a santa fe nm 
businessman who was held at a base south of baghdad 
ill become a better person and a better husband after this 
vinton added embracing his wife sue 
it is a monumental occasion said vinton who had been 
brought from the military base to a baghdad hotel wednesday to see 
his wife she had come to baghdad with other american and british 
women seeking freedom for their loved ones 
hundreds of americans and other foreigners were held at 
strategic installations to deter any foreign attack 
carr the american oilworker said iraqi soldiers captured him 
in kuwait in the first hours of the invasion sent him to baghdad 
and a few days later to a phosphate plant 
the hostages had few complaints about their physical treatment 
but they said iraqi soldiers had stolen their belongings 
we were treated extremely well they tried to get us 
everything we asked for guy seago 45 of johnson city tenn 
said of his guards 
they provided us with what they could they did their best 
said tallmadge ledford 45 of windhow nh

49 a computer consultant from seattle who was held at two 
communications centers in baghdad 
he said his house in kuwait was stripped clean after the 
invasion and estimated he had lost 80000 worth of property

held at an oil refinery in basra built their own makeshift 
ninehole golf course to pass the time 
vinton said he walked at least 15 miles a day to keep in shape 
and also kill time he said he lost 28 pounds 
hamid el miloudi 46 of chattanooga tenn until recently had 
been one of the americans who had sought refuge at the besieged 
us embassy in kuwait

produce for the two dozen or so people stranded there 
ginn complained about the monotony of the available food he 
said his group had been fed smoked salmon every day for three 
weeks 
i wont be able to look at smoked salmon again he said

a 22yearold woman who suffered a rare form 
of heart failure after giving birth survived two heart transplants 
in 23 hours and doctors are shaking their heads over how quickly 
they were able to find two donor organs 
the problem she had after delivery itself is unusual that we 
could find a heart in this area at this time is unusual said 
albert pfister the cardiac surgeon who brought the second heart 
from florida to washington 
and that we could find a second heart right when we needed it 
almost borders on making you want to become religious 
rita tyson 22 of alexandria va who gave birth to her first 
child in august underwent the first transplant nov 13 
two hours after surgery her body began violently rejecting the 
new organ 
doctors at washington hospital center began administering 
immunosuppressant drugs but within hours physicians realized that 
if tyson was to live she needed another new heart 
at 5 am a second heart was located that same day doctors 
began yet another transplant and by midnight a new heart was 
pumping in tysons chest 
i know i could have died tyson said this week im never 
going to take anything for granted again 
neither are her doctors the team of surgeons nurses and other 
medical staff who toiled on tyson for four days straight are still 
talking about the rare hyperacute rejection of the first heart 
it occurs in less than 1 percent of all transplants and what 
they in hospital vernacular call a great save 
fortunately both operations went like clockwork said steven 
boyce who with pfister heads the hospitals transplant program 
tyson had no history of heart disease and according to her 
doctors had a healthy pregnancy and an uncomplicated delivery 
one in 4000 women may develop such failure after delivery of 
these only one in 15000 has a totally unexplained onset tyson 
was the one in 15000

increased dramatically since iraq invaded kuwait publishers and 
booksellers say

1300store waldenbooks chain showed a 67 percent increase in sales 
of prophetic books such as the late great planet earth 
according to susan arnold company spokeswoman in stamford conn 
sales of the bible and the koran also increased sharply she 
said 
at b dalton bookseller in new york books by nostradamus a 
french astrologer and physicist who died in 1566 are selling well 
said assistant manager terrel holmes

east near the end of the 20th century

music may soothe listeners but it can be murder 
on the players bruised lips sore hands and ringing ears are 
dangerous occupational hazards for musicians and other performers 
suffer too 
many doctors dont see it that way says dr alice g 
brandfonbrener director of the medical program for performing 
artists 
the sore neck of a violin player injuries actors suffer during 
stage fighting or a singers lung pangs are hardly emergencies but 
they are typical of serious pains that can affect performers 
livelihoods she said friday 
musicians problems are not obvious most of them and have 
been kind of dismissed by physicians in the past as being part of 
the neurosis of the musician and therefore not real said 
brandfonbrener whose program is one of about 18 similar efforts 
nationwide 
it is the only such program with a fulltime physician she 
said 
lola mcintyre 35 a pianist and teacher from the indianapolis 
area said her hands were practically crippled by swelling and pain 
when she arrived at brandfonbreners office three months ago 
mcintyre said she had visited three other doctors who prescribed 
medicine that did not work one one doctor even told her she might 
never perform or teach again but handstrenghthening exercises and 
a modified practice schedule suggested by brandfonbrener brought 
dramatic improvement she said 
mainstream doctors commonly tell ailing performers go home 
and rest and dont play and that just is not going to happen 
brandfonbrener said since few can afford to miss work 
the 5yearold program handles about 600 patient visits a year 
and about half are onetime visits she said twothirds of the 
patients are musicians and the rest are dancers and theater people 
fees are low since about 25 percent of those treated do not have 
insurance 
mcintyre said her injury wasnt unusual several of her students 
left school with serious performancerelated problems she said 
brandfonbrener a 59yearold internist who also plays piano is 
studying the physical problems of orchestral musicians under a 
20000 grant from the national endowment for the arts 
she also serves as senior editor of the philadelphiabased 
journal medical problems of performing artists and coeditor a 
new medical textbook by the same name 
theres an awful lot we dont understand but at least were 
beginning to look at it she said physicians teachers and 
performers are beginning to be willing to look and not being so 
threatened by talking about it

have limited their stargazing time 
it was similar to what mcauliffe the new hampshire 
schoolteacher killed in the jan 28 1986 explosion of the space 
shuttle challenger had planned to do 
we werent trying to take the place of what they were going to 
do on challenger said karen widenhofer a madison county ala 
teacher on temporary assignment with nasa who assisted in the 
classroom friday at marshall space flight center but this shows 
that nasa is still interested in education and encouraging students 
in science and math 
students also gathered at a classroom at the goddard space 
flight center in greenbelt md 
denny elkins a ninthgrader from snellville ga said the 
lesson helped revive his interest in the space program he said he 
was watching challengers launch when the shuttle exploded killing 
all seven crew members 
the explosion was the biggest impression of my life he 
said i really wanted to be an astronaut but when i saw that i 
said no 
now im reconsidering 
the lesson was conducted by sam durrance and jeffrey hoffman 
ron parise and robert parker joined in to help answer students 
questions 
it may have featured another space first hoffman appeared 
before the tv cameras in a dress shirt and tie 
as far as i know nobodys ever worn a tie in space he 
said as the tie floated freely in the zerogravity environment 
the astronauts also discussed the missions problems including 
computer failures and difficulties with an instrument pointing 
system that have limited the use of the observatory 
you may have heard of some of the problems weve been 
having hoffman said its been quite an interesting and 
dynamic mission 
unfortunately some failures with computer terminals have 
caused us to redo the way were doing our mission parise said 
were slowly working around everything

nato defense ministers have reaffirmed 
their plan to build a new air base in southern italy that the us 
congress has refused to help pay for now that the cold war is over 
all the defense ministers strongly supported such a base and 
reaffirmed their commitment to the necessary funds nato 
secretary general manfred woerner said after a twoday ministerial 
session ended friday 
the us administration and nato officials have argued that the 
base which will cost 800 million to 900 million including 
building and relocation costs is needed to give the alliance a 
strong base in the mediterranean 
the us air forces 401st tactical fighter wing comprising 72 
jetfighters is based at torrejon air base near madrid and is 
scheduled to move out by the end of 1992 
us officials say the air base near crotone italy could be 
key for us response to crises in the middle east or north africa 
the united states is supposed to pay 28 percent of the costs 
but some congressional leaders want the europeans to foot more of 
the bill and they have argued the base is no longer necessary 
because of the end of the cold war 
earlier this year congress directed the administration to ask 
nato whether they still supported the crotone plan first approved 
in 1988 
they basically reaffirmed the original decision defense 
secretary dick cheney told reporters friday ill take that back 
to the congress 
he said crotone is an important alliance project not just 
a us project 
cheney said us military commanders in europe believe that the 
crotone base would be among the two or three most important nato 
air bases in europe 
woerner said he hoped the very strong consensus among the 
defense ministers in favor of relocating the base will play a 
role in future decisions of the american congress

a tahitian court has declared marlon 
brandos daughter mentally incompetent stalling her brothers 
murder case 
cheyenne brando 20 is wanted by prosecutors as a material 
witness in the trial of her half brother christian brando he is 
charged with fatally shooting miss brandos tahitian lover dag 
drollet at the brando mansion in the hollywood hills on may 16 
miss brandos attorney michael nasatir described her friday as 
a very disturbed and very sick young woman and objected to 
continued pressure from prosecutors to bring her back to the united 
states 
nasatir told the judge that lawyers in tahiti informed him that 
cheyenne brando was declared incompetent and placed under the 
guardianship of her mother tarita tarapia brando after a hearing 
thursday 
deputy district attorney steven barshop said he had been 
notified of the conservatorship action but said he had too few 
details to judge miss brandos condition 
were dealing with thousands of miles away with language 
problems and a different law he said weve taken the position 
all along that a trial will go forward with or without cheyenne 
however she is a very material witness 
shortly after the shooting miss brando returned to tahiti 
where she had drollets child was confined to a mental hospital 
and at one point was treated for a drug overdose according to the 
brando family 
there was also a report from a family spokesman in november that 
she tried to hang herself and was hospitalized 
she has refused to return to california to testify and tahitian 
authorities also have barred her exit charging her as an 
accomplice in drollets slaying 
also on friday christian brando 32 charged with firstdegree 
murder in the shooting of the 26yearold drollet missed a court 
hearing because of a misunderstanding his lawyer said 
superior court judge robert thomas ordered him to court on 
tuesday for setting of a trial date he said he anticipates 
starting the trial jan 14 more than two months after it was 
originally scheduled to begin

the us food and drug administration will 
investigate a newspapers findings that hundreds of people are 
strangling or suffocating in protective restraints in nursing homes 
and hospitals 
the reports which claim the fda failed to respond to 23 
reported deaths were contained in a fourday series of articles 
published in the star tribune beginning last sunday 
fda officials said friday they would try to determine whether 
the posey co of arcadia calif leading manufacturer of the 
devices failed to report deaths and serious injuries to the 
agency as required by law 
the agency would also evaluate a study performed for the 
newspaper that concluded at least 200 people die every year in the 
restraining belts vests and jackets 
restraints have been used for decades to keep hospital and 
nursinghome patients from falling from beds and wheelchairs or 
wandering unattended 
if the fda finds the hazards of restraints have been seriously 
underestimated it would take action ranging from educational 
programs to recalls or seizures of the products said agency 
spokeswoman susan cruzan 
in california a spokesman for the posey co said the firm will 
cooperate with the agency 
the star tribune reported the results of an eightmonth 
investigation into the use of restraints 
the newspaper found the posey co has never reported a 
restraintrelated death to the fda even though the firm knew that 
people were strangling in the devices further it determined the 
fda did nothing about 23 deaths that were reported by other 
sources the paper quoted agency officials as saying the number was 
not large enough to warrant further action 
representatives of the states nursing home industry hailed the 
fdas announcement 
if you look at the products senior citizens use and the 
handicapped use it seems like they get less scrutiny than those 
that ablebodied people use said rick carter of care providers 
of minnesota an industry trade group

cargo planes on a mercy mission for the soviet 
union soared from a freezing airfield beginning a new berlin 
airlft that carried tons of food and a weight of historical irony 
the food flown friday was among supplies stockpiled since the 
winter of 194849 during the first frost of the cold war when 
western allies flew the tons of supplies to beleaguered west berlin 
to overcome a soviet blockade of the city 
the berlin reserves designed to feed and care for west 
berliners in case of another blockade are being given to the 
soviets free of charge to help them through the winter 
soviet soldiers and german workers began loading 100 tons of 
powdered milk from a warehouse onto red army trucks before sunrise 
friday 
escorted by german police and soldiers a convoy of 16 trucks 
drove to a soviet military airfield about 20 miles south of berlin 
and loaded the milk powder onto cargo planes bound for the soviet 
union 
the berlin food reserves alone total 214500 tons including 
wheat sugar canned meat and canned fruit said andreas 
schuldenzucker of the government press office 
with eastwest tensions virtually at an end germany has started 
sending the soviet union enormous amounts of food and other aid 
germans feel a gratitude for soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev because he did not obstruct the unification of germany 
which became official oct 3 some germans have even taken to the 
streets with tin cans seeking contributions from passersby in 
potsdam 
a telethon on germanys zdf television has raised 21 million to 
date while companies are rushing to take part in the relief 
program 
spokesman hans klein on friday said 250000 tons of food and 
supplies will be shipped by air rail and sea over the next four 
months 
kremlin officials have asked the germans to give priority 
treatment to shipping badly needed powdered milk 
the germans expect the humanitarian mission to continue at full 
pace despite questions about the extent of hunger in the soviet 
union officials say bare market shelves there are caused by 
distribution problems and panic buying not an actual lack of food 
a civic group also has urged eastern germans to invite soviet 
soldiers home for christmas 
an estimated 360000 soviet troops are still stationed in former 
east germany they are to be pulled out by 1994

north korean musicians crossed into 
south korea today for the first time since partition in 1945 for a 
series of concerts they hope will be a prelude to reunification 
i feel passionately that koreans in the north and the south 
cannot live separated by the tragedy of national division said 
song dong chun leader of the 33member north korean delegation 
song vowed to make the seoul concerts a festival for 
unification but he also criticized south korean for jailing 
dissidents who had made unauthorized contacts with north koreans 
the north koreans were greeted by hwang pyungki chief 
organizer of the seoul concerts who called the border crossing a 
prelude to the crumbling wall of division 
the musicians will play a series of concerts during their 
fourday stay in seoul the music will be traditional with no 
political overtones as agreed on in an earlier border meeting 
south korean musicians visited north korea in october and the 
two countries have played friendly soccer matches 
song said he had been uncertain about visiting seoul after south 
korea earlier this month arrested three dissidents involved in 
forming a civilian unification movement 
south korea has rejected a north korean request for the release 
of the dissidents calling it an internal matter 
north korean prime minister yon hyong muk was to hold a third 
round of talks with south korean president roh taewoo in seoul on 
tuesday 
north korea wants a nonaggression arrangement to be adopted at 
the seoul meeting while south korea insists an agreement 
facilitating exchanges and cooperation must be signed first 
south korea has sought civilian exchanges in an effort to open 
the norths closed society 
the two nations have been bitter rivals since the division of 
their peninsula in 1945 the border has been shut since the korean 
war ended in 1953 and there is no mail or other direct 
communication between them

more than 50000 workers at general motors corp 
will have at least an extra week tacked on to their holiday 
vacations because of slow sales 
gm officials said friday that 18 of its 35 north american car 
and truck assembly plants in 14 states will be closed for the week 
of dec 17 in addition to the traditional holiday shutdown 
the endofyear break had been scheduled to run from the end of 
the last shift on friday dec 21 until the first shift on 
wednesday jan 2 
gm officials last week predicted the first quarterly red ink on 
operations at the worlds largest manufacturer since the 1981 
recession chairman robert stempel said the company would cut 
fourthquarter car and truck production by 111000 to a total of 
107 million vehicles for the period 
next week ford motor co is cutting back from two shifts to one 
shift at its car and truck assembly plants in lorian ohio 
affecting 2000 people chrysler corp meanwhile will close its 
toledo ohio jeep plant next week idling 4700 workers 
but it wont be a black christmas for those employees united 
auto workers union contracts with each of the big three include 
programs aimed at providing the workers with up to 95 percent of 
their regular pay during a temporary shutdown 
ford and chrysler havent announced production plans for the 
week of dec 17 a week in which gm plans to lay off 50470 
workers each of the automakers said the shutdowns are due to slow 
dealer orders 
the number of auto workers on layoff actually will be larger 
than the total from assembly plants whenever an assembly plant is 
shut down layoffs usually occur at supplier and component plants 
tracking those numbers is extremely difficult 
with more than a dozen assembly plants closing down in the next 
two weeks its likely that thousands more employees at the 
component factories will be laid off at least temporarily

at the request of the daily news federal and 
city officials are investigating allegations of bombings and arson 
in the sixweekold strike at the newspaper 
us attorney andrew j maloney said an inquiry by city police 
and the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms began 
several weeks ago at the request of the tabloids lawyers 
there have been a number of fires and uses of explosive 
devices in the strike maloney said 
meanwhile friday both sides said they would accept an 
invitation to meet with the top federal labor mediator in 
washington as soon as possible 
news publisher james hoge claims a conspiracy of violence has 
been waged against replacement workers and news distributors the 
unions deny any such conspiracy and no law enforcement officials 
have confirmed hoges allegations 
the unions also claim news employees have attacked strikers 
police are investigating those complaints 
meanwhile a federal judge said friday that the paper could be 
sold by hawkers at subway and train stations for at least another 
10 days 
us district judge miriam g cedarbaum of manhattan extended 
her weekold order to dec 17 new york newsday and the new york 
post both quickly applied to gain the same access and were awaiting 
an answer 
cedarbaum said the daily news convinced her the papers first 
amendment rights would be violated if the hawkers were kept out of 
the trains 
most newsstands around the city and in train stations have 
stopped carrying the paper since the strike began oct 25 
the newspaper filed suit to maintain access for the hawkers 
after the metropolitan transportation authority which operates the 
citys subway system and suburban commuter rail lines barred them 
the news has published every day during the strike but 
distribution has been a major problem with circulation cut in half 
from the prestrike 109 million copies daily newsday and the post

local and federal agents seized money guns and 
even buildings as they busted a murderous jamaican drug posse with 
roots in new york and texas 
the raids which resulted in 18 arrests began thursday night 
and ended early friday authorities said they seized more than 
150000 in cash six buildings owned by the posse and 15 guns 
including submachine guns 
fbi spokesman james fox estimated gang members took in more than 
100 million over the past five years and carried out at least 10 
murders ordered by its leader eric vassell he escaped arrest 
the gang known as the gulleymen posse distributed heroin 
wholesale in brooklyn during the past decade and branched into 
crack in the late 1980s when it expanded to dallas officials 
said 
gang members spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on car 
rentals to run crack from brooklyn to dallas and return with guns 
every week the government said 
the biggest raid was at a brooklyn apartment building known to 
dealers and addicts as the 247 house because it was open 24 
hours a day seven days a week including christmas thanksgiving 
and new years fox said 
when the gang wanted to discipline members they would simply 
kill their people and many of the killings occurred right in the 
hallway fox said 
fox said as the trucks and swat van drove up in front and the 
agents and detectives piled out neighbors in the windows and in 
the street were seen applauding and cheering 
fox said posse members offered virtually no resistance 
vassell was believed to be in the new york area andrew j 
maloney the us attorney in brooklyn described vassell as a 
31yearold jamaican who has fathered 14 to 18 children by various 
women and has ties to the ruling pnp party in jamaica 
in the complaint filed by maloneys office an informant is 
quoted as saying that guns shipped to jamaica inside tv sets in 
february were votegetters to be used in a runoff election on 
the island 
whenever there is a major event in jamaica vassell sends a 
shipment of guns it said 
maloney said he was not claiming that jamaican prime minister 
michael manley was aware of vassells actions 
eighteen of 42 alleged posse members were arrested if convicted 
they face life in prison on narcotics conspiracy and racketeering 
charges that include murder money laundering and obtaining 
fraudulent passports and green cards maloney said four people 
were arrested in raids in dallas and two in albany the others were 
arrested during raids in brooklyn and long island 
it was the second major joint fbipolice operation this week on 
tuesday agents toppled the green dragons a chinesevietnamese 
street gang that allegedly shook down merchants in the new york

a flight log from the plane that dropped the 
atomic bomb on hiroshima failed to sell at auction after the 
missions navigator said it was not the original 
as bidding was about to open at 40000 friday auctioneer 
stephen massey said christies could not guarantee the log from the 
b29 bomber enola gay was not a copy 
no bids were offered and the auctioneer did not go lower 
christies had estimated the flight log would fetch 100000 to 
150000 but theodore j van kirk the enola gays navigator told 
the auction house last week that he still has the original 
meanwhile at christies friday a letter from vermont patriot 
ethan allen which had been valued at 15000 to 20000 sold 
for 38000 
the karpeles manuscript library in santa barbara calif won a 
bidding war with the university of vermont for the letter which 
allen wrote to the british governor of quebec in 1787 when vermont 
was independent 
vermont joined the united states four years later allen led the 
green mountain boys in a raid on fort ticonderoga during the 
american revolution 
the christies flight log is owned by eileen lewis widow of 
capt robert a lewis the flights copilot she had hoped to 
retire on the money said christies manuscript specialist chris 
coover 
the auction house did get 12000 for a pair of binoculars from 
the flight that were owned by mrs lewis 
coover said christies didnt pull the log from the auction 
block because it was confident it was the original but he added he 
doesnt doubt van kirks sincerity 
it is conceivable van kirk could have copied the log in 
flight someone else could have or it was copied immediately after 
the mission coover said the log offered for sale records basic 
flight information such as position altitude air speed and 
compass direction on three yellow oblong sheets its 915 am 
entry noting the bombs release simply says bombaway

the government facing calls for its 
resignation and the threat of strikes has put off plans to 
eliminate subsidies for bread meat medicine and other goods 
protests and strikes followed the lifting of state price 
controls on nov 1 which doubled and tripled prices on many foods 
and consumer goods 
the announcement friday on state tv said the lifting of 
subsidies for bread meat dairy products sugar oil soaps 
medicine and medical services items which had been scheduled for 
jan 1 would be postponed until june 
the decision reflected growing nervousness among officials that 
the opposition was gaining strength and could pose a threat to 
premier petre romans government 
the national drivers union issued a statement friday 
threatening a nationwide strike monday unless the government 
resigned in favor of a government of national unity 
they also demanded the dismissal of all former communists who 
are still leading local governments and industry 
the nationwide fratia union has said it might declare a general 
strike next week 
silviu brucan who helped found the governing national salvation 
front said the government has erred in underestimating the 
social effect of the price rises 
they should have been more candid with the people he said 
in an interview friday explaining that the lifting of state 
controls was inevitable but would have a very bad effect at 
first 
the civic alliance an opposition group has called for 
nationwide protests to mark this months oneyear anniversary of 
the revolution that overthrew nicolae ceausescus communist 
dictatorship 
president ion iliescu criticized the alliance as a street 
movement that tries to substitute the political opposition 
i call on all responsible elements and citizens to assure a 
favorable climate for the anniversary of the revolution iliescu 
said in a televised address late friday make december a month of 
national conciliation 
the national salvation front won may elections by promising an 
easy transition to a market economy it has lost popularity as 
prices soar 
brucan said the front would lose the next election scheduled 
for 1992 because of the toug economic reforms it must enact to 
transform the heavily centralized economy 
but brucan who no longer holds an official position called on 
the opposition to abandon its efforts to bring down the government 
saying this was not the moment for a change of leadership 
whoevers in power now will have to take necessarily unpopular 
measures so taking the government would be political suicide he 
said

cautious investigators say there is 
increasing evidence the shooting deaths of eight male motorists 
over the past year is the work of two female serial killers bent on 
robbery 
we cant for 100 percent sure say that these cases are 
related said police capt steve binegar chief of marion county 
detectives 
we havent put together the linkage until fairly recently 
there are some commonalities in all the cases and of course there 
are a lot of things that are not similar 
but police this week released the drawings of two women being 
sought for questioning the women involved in a traffic accident 
in marion county in july also have been tentatively linked to a 
missing missionary and the most recent killing in dixie county on 
nov 19 police said 
their names have not been released however and investigators 
are reluctant to say much about them 
the victims were probably driving alone police said their 
bodies were found in rural areas in northern florida and southern 
georgia 
binegar said bodies of some of the victims were nude or 
partially nude but there was no evidence indicating a sexual 
assault was connected to the killings

while the united states and europe 
battled over provisions of a new world trade pact developing 
nations say their complaints were ignored 
if the negotiations ultimately fail to produce a new agreement 
the poor countries say they will be the main victims 
when the elephants fight the grass gets trampled on rw 
chirwa head of the malawi delegation said friday after the talks 
broke down over how to lower trade barriers 
the industrial power elite spent five days arguing over the 
substantial spoils a new world trade order would yield while the 
poor nations largely waited in the wings 
neither the united states nor the european community would 
sufficiently compromise at the talks held under the auspices of 
the general agreement on tariffs and trade the organization known 
as gatt is charged with policing international trade rules 
the talks in brussels failed and the third world nations were 
left with dashed hopes 
the entire negotiations were hijacked by a bilateral issue 
complained indian commerce minister subramanian swamy 
the ambitious uruguay round talks will resume in geneva next 
year but the confidence of many developing nations is now badly 
shaken 
we were looking for a new dialogue with the industrial 
nations said colombias economic development minister ernesto 
samper but when the talks were suspended he said we got 
nothing 
if the talks ultimately collapse in geneva the poor nations 
will pay most heavily 
a revamped world trading system would give developing nations 
more access to sell their goods in world markets it would also 
allow them to gain the benefits from a global economic expansion 
driven by the reforms 
if the economies of the rich nations were to grow by an average 
annual rate of 1 percent the exports of the worlds net debtor 
countries would grow by 175 percent each year said michel 
camdessus managing director of the international monetary fund 
we tried to improve the economic situation in the world but 
we failed said german minister helmut haussmann that is bad 
for all but especially for the third world 
yet many of the representatives of those nations felt shut out 
of the negotiating action 
foreign minister anisul islam mahmud of bangladesh complained he 
felt like a little schoolboy waiting outside the classroom 
the brussels meeting was marked by a lack of transparency and 
selective participation madagascars commerce minister georges 
solofoson said at the close on behalf of the african nations 
cutting tariff and nontariff barriers would boost gross 
domestic product the total annual goods and services by nearly 3 
percent in developing nations approximately twice the amount of 
official development aid extended by the industrial countries 
camdessus said 
eliminating farm subsidies in the rich countries the major 
cause of the talks failure could have increased such exports from 
the third world by 50 billion he said 
but european community nations refused to accept the deep 
subsidy cuts demanded by the united states canada and other 
exporting nations 
such subsidies keep food from the industrial nations 
artificially cheap and prevent developing nations from expanding 
their own agricultural sector 
wed rather produce our own chickens than import frozen 
chickens said roman catholic archbishop isidore de sousa of 
benin 
protectionist limits on textile imports from lowwage countries 
like bangladesh and india into the industrialized nations also cost 
the developing nations billions of dollars in trade

prime minister chatichai choonhavan 
resigned today in an apparent maneuver to let him make sweeping 
changes in his cabinet 
the head of a party that is a coalition partner predicted 
chatichai would quickly return to his post 
he would then be free to revamp his cabinet since all the 
ministers automatically lost their positions with his resignation 
the countrys powerful military has harshly criticized several 
members of the cabinet chatichais government has come under 
criticism for corruption ineptitude and internal squabbling 
the resignation was announced by the prime ministers office 
bangkok newspapers which had predicted the move said chatichai 
had received assurances beforehand from the major parties of his 
sevenparty coalition of support to become prime minister again 
kukrit pramoj who heads the social action party said in a 
television interview that chatichai would probably regain his post 
because there were many parties backing him including his own 
chatichai and the cabinet remain in place in a caretaker status 
until the president of the parliament declares a new prime 
minister 
prior to the announcement chatichai met with king bhumibol 
adulyadej the state media said the constitutional monarch is 
consulted by the countrys leaders before major changes are made 
chatichai a 68yearold former army general and diplomat came 
to power in august 1988

manuel noriegas taped prison conversations were 
apparently leaked to cnn by a person assisting the drug enforcement 
administration a federal source said 
the miami herald today identified the source of the leak as jose 
blandon a longtime political opponent of noriegas and a potential 
witness against him 
the fbi is trying to determine who gave the tapes to the 
network which aired some of them over the last month 
according to court documents filed friday prosecutors 
subpoenaed 162 noriega phone recordings made between december and 
august at the metropolitan correctional center outside of miami 
the deposed panamanian dictator is jailed there on drug charges 
but investigators found little of interest and reviewed only 52 
of the tapes 
in late june 22 tapes were reviewed under the direction and 
supervision of the dea case agents by a person assisting dea in 
its criminal investigation against noriega the government said in 
a filing signed by assistant us attorneys norman moscowitz and 
sonia odonnell 
a federal law enforcement source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity told the associated press that the tapes leaked to cnn 
were among those 22 and the individual helping the dea to review 
the tapes was believed responsible 
the official would not identify the suspect but said the person 
could face criminal charges 
quoting unidentified sources the herald reported that person 
who assisted the dea was blandon a onetime senior intelligence 
officer in panama and panamas consul general in new york he 
testified before a senate committee in 1988 that his former boss 
noriega protected usbound cocaine shipments 
dea washington spokeswoman illa brown said the agency could not 
discuss pending prosecutions and referred all questions to the 
us attorneys office in miami us attorney dexter lehtinen said 
he could not comment on a pending investigation 
cnn spokesman steve haworth declined comment he said the 
network does not generally comment on reports from confidential 
sources 
the court documents filed friday were the prosecutions response 
to noriegas motion to dismiss the case against him on grounds of 
government misconduct 
attorneys for the deposed panamanian dictator claimed the 
government illegally taped his prison phone calls undercut his 
defense by freezing all his assets and tried to involve lead 
defense attorney frank rubino in a bribery scheme 
lehtinen said friday the governments response showed there was 
no substance to noriegas charges of misconduct 
the united states maintains that no privileged calls were ever 
taped because noriega was fully advised that all of his telephone 
calls would be monitored unless he followed a specific procedure 
for privileged calls to his lawyer lehtinen said noriega 
never invoked that procedure therefore all of his calls were 
properly monitored 
prosecutors said noreiga who has unlimited use of a phone 
outside his cell made 1400 calls between feb 1 and nov 8 
nearly all those calls were to his lawyers but some were relayed 
overseas by his lawyers a violation of bureau of prisons policy 
lehtinen said noriegas attorneys knew the calls were monitored 
and even discussed that on some of the tapes 
no hearing date has been set to consider the dismissal motion 
filed last month during the legal battle over cnns tapes of 
noriegas prison conversations 
transcripts of those tapes were made public thursday after a 
request from four news organizations but most of the conversations 
obtained by cnn were in code or about noriegas personal matters 
noriega is awaiting trial on charges of taking 46 million in 
payoffs to protect the cocaine trade passing through panama from 
colombia to the united states

the us embassy said today it was 
evacuating libyan prisoners of war from chad as part of an 
international effort but libya called the move piracy and 
asked for an emergency security council meeting 
the embassy refused to comment on reports that the united states 
had trained the pows for commando operations against libya 
the libyans were captured by chad in fighting between 1983 and 
1987 by soldiers of former president hissene habre who was toppled 
one week ago 
habre went into exile in cameroon and rebel leader idriss deby 
was named interim president deby whose movement received much of 
its weaponry from libya is freeing the libyan pows 
the evacuation effort apparently started on friday when a plane 
carrying 200 libyan pows left for nigeria according to news 
reports 
us embassy spokesman mark krischik said the evacuations were 
part of an international effort but he declined to say whether 
the government of deby or french soldiers based there were 
participating 
i can confirm that we are continuing our humanitarian gesture 
to provide transportation out of chad for those unwilling to return 
to libya he said 
agence francepresse the french news agency reported that 500 
more libyan pows were to be evacuated today to nigeria then to a 
third country it cited an unidentified american source for its 
information 
krischik refused to comment on the freed pows destination 
barbara shell a spokeswoman at the us embassy in chad 
refused to comment on an afp report that the united states had 
trained about 700 of the 2000 pows for commando operations against 
libya 
the libyan foreign ministry in a communique charged that the 
united states on friday seized 200 libyan pows in chad and took 
them away against their will aboard a c141 air force plane it 
called the move international piracy equivalent to 
statesponsored terrorism 
libyas official jana news agency charged that 17 libyans were 
executed for refusing the us evacuation 
jana citing diplomatic and media sources in chad alleged that 
pows refusing to obey americas orders are being massacred daily 
at a rate of three prisoners every hour before the very eyes of 
french troops and the us military personnel present in chad 
the libya communique carried by jana and monitored in rome 
accused the united states of a grave violation of international 
conventions and laws 
the us has launched an aggression against great al 
jamahiriya libya representing a dangerous precedent unsurpassed 
in history the statement said 
libya demands an emergency session of the security council to 
discuss the piracy act pursued by the us it said 
the state department in washington would not comment on the 
report of commando training and said it had heard nothing about 
libyas request for a un meeting 
jana later reported libya was sending its foreign minister 
ibrahim muhammed albishari to nigeria in an effort to get the 
libyans back it did not say when he would depart 
the libyan communique urged the international red cross and 
human rights groups to condemn the action and make every endeavor 
to release the prisoners taken as hostages apart from saving the 
lives of those facing the same fate 
after habres ouster a delegation of libyan officials flew to 
chad and arranged for the bulk of the libyan pows to return to 
libya the delegation also reportedly sought to obtain custody of 
libyans who had turned against their nations leader col moammar 
gadhafi

a new subway line began operating in rome on 
saturday but city officials admitted it will do little to 
alleviate the capitals chaotic traffic conditions 
the new line an extension of the bline is five miles long and 
can carry 14000 passengers per hour from romes main train 
terminal to a station near rebibbia prison on the east side of the 
city 
mayor franco carraro who made an inaugural trip on the subway 
friday said that although the new line is a step in the right 
direction many more miles of subway tracks are needed to solve 
romes traffic problems 
the mayor also stressed the need for improved bus and taxi 
service he reported that rome has one taxi for every 550 people 
while paris has one for every 150 people 
the extension of the bline took eight years and 1 billion to 
build and cost the lives of two construction workers in the 
process 
a major impediment to construction of new subway lines in rome 
is the wealth of archaeological treasures lying beneath the city

whilerep frank annunzio and his supporters 
were dining on italian food in celebration of his reelection 
fellow democrats were working to strip him of a job most never get 
a committee chairmanship 
it was a great irony for a lawmaker who had just survived the 
toughest campaign of his 26year career a race that had centered 
almost entirely on his ties to the savingsandloan industry 
not only did he defeat his opponent a popular state senator 
but he also slayed the national republican party which had poured 
thousands of dollars into chicago in an unsuccessful bid to take 
away annunzios seat 
that triumph didnt matter 
while a band played and the buffet was laid out that tuesday 
night democrats already had approached rep charles rose dnc 
about taking the reins of the house administration committee a 
panel that takes care of the nitty gritty of lawmakers offices 
essential to daily life in congress 
the complaints annunzios staff was abrasive he didnt take 
enough interest in the committees business and some of the sampl 
charges that were aired during the campaign apparently were too 
much for some new lawmakers to stomach 
one day later democrats bounced him 127125 in a secret 
ballot and elected rose 
with annunzio stripped of one job he still has a second 
powerful post chairmanship of a powerful house banking 
subcommittee that oversees the maligned sampl industry 
for years annunzio has received substantial campaign 
contributions from sampls a fact that generated much bad publicity 
during his 1990 campaign for reelection but ironcially one 
committee member says annunzios loss of one job should shield him 
from further setbacks 
that would be two blows said rep bruce vento dminn a 
committee member 
along with rep glenn anderson dcalif of the public works 
and transportation committee annunzio was one of two veteran 
chairmen ousted by the democratic caucus 
congress does believe in the seniority system rose said 
but if a senior member is not performing in a way members think 
is useful they will not hesitate to make a change he 
annunzio wasnt a handson chairman 
thats a very bum rap said dean coston the committees 
acting staff director 
its really cruel what happened to him said rep richard 
durbin dill an annunzio ally 
annunzio isnt talking about the coup but coston said news of 
the discontent stunned his boss especially after he successfully 
defended his seat in the nov 6 election 
coston said he annunzio and others worked the phones tuesday as 
word spread that a revolt was underway 
the man was tired after the election mentally and physically 
worn out he wasnt prepared to take on another fight particularly 
among friends in his own party coston said 
hes been a loyal servant in the trenches he added but 
then again no one has accused this institution of being fair 
if you pay your dues do you get stepped on asked rep mary 
rose oakar dohio hes very bitter about it 
while other panels tackle transportation defense education and 
foreign affairs annunzios administration committee is in charge 
of the housekeeping of the house staff size employee pay 
computers capitol hill police parking spaces the barber shop 
perhaps not as weighty as mx missiles or student loans 
nonetheless a committee chairmanship is a juicy political plum 
that only a handful of the 435 house members will ever receive 
durbin suggested that if annunzio had introduced himself to more 
of the newly elected democrats he may have been able to survive the 
challenge for the house administration post 
im sure their only knowledge of frank annunzio was from 
recent news stories about the heated campaign and all the 
accusations about his involvement in sampls durbin said 
even though his own district obviously didnt believe those 
charges theyre bound to take a toll on a persons good name he 
said

a former leftist guerrilla group is 
trying to capitalize on discontent with the two traditional 
political parties in sundays election for a constitutional 
assembly 
the 70member assembly will convene in february to rewrite the 
104yearold charter 
opinion polls indicate the m19 party led by antonio navarro 
could capture 40 percent of the vote and national salvation a new 
conservative group may do almost as well 
such a result would be a devastating rejection of the two 
parties that have dominated colombian politics for 150 years the 
liberals and the conservatives many voters blame the traditional 
ruling classes for corruption and for failing to curb violence that 
has taken tens of thousands of lives 
if the polls are accurate navarros former m19 guerrilla 
movement will become one of the most important political forces in 
colombia 
m19 laid down its weapons nine months ago in exchange for a 
government pardon its leader carlos pizarro was assassinated 
less than a month before presidential elections in may and his 
replacement navarro finished an unexpectedly strong third 
navarro was apppointed health minister but resigned two months 
ago to run for a seat in the constituent assembly 
if we take control of the assembly because thats how the 
people want it the result will have to be respected he said in 
an interview 
some colombians fear the army which has been fought guerrilla 
insurgencies for three decades will take over the government if 
m19 wins control of the assembly 
politicians and newspaper columnists are dredging up the groups 
violent past to warn or frighten voters 
immoral acts committed in the past remain unpunished but not 
forgiven said alvaro gomez a former conservative party leader 
who founded national salvation gomez was kidnapped by m19 in 1988 
and held for 50 days 
navarro insists his party is not marxist and that it seeks 
through political action to help guarantee the civil rights of 
women children the elderly and members of the political 
opposition 
his organization wants to set itself apart from its own past 
particularly the 1985 seizure of the palace of justice in which 100 
people were killed including 11 supreme court justices 
since giving up its weapons m19 has been under constant threat 
of violence from political enemies 
after navarro told president cesar gaviria recently of an 
assassination plot gaviria strengthened the security detail 
protecting the m19 leader 
few election rallies were held many candidates including 
navarro did not take their campaigns to the streets for fear of 
being killed 
few doubt colombias powerful cocaine cartels donated money to 
candidates but it is difficult to measure their involvement 
candidates rarely mentioned the governments 15monthold war on 
drug traffickers 
drug barons were blamed for the murders of three candidates 
before the presidential election in may including pizarro of m19 
cocaine traffickers hope the constituent assembly empowered to 
consider any issue will prohibit extraditions to the united states 
and help them receive pardons from the government 
the campaign was characterized by vague statements on the need 
to modernize society and curb corruption 
clara lopez an outspoken human rights activist said the 
election gives voters a chance to send a message to colombian 
politicians whose actions she compared to president bushs 
unfulfilled readmylips pledge not to raise taxes 
unfortunately weve been reading lips for 30 years she 
said

a historic federal program that modernized 
thousands of farms and provides electricity to 25 million americans 
is threatened by financial failures that taxpayers may have to 
absorb 
a handful of rural electric cooperatives have defaulted on 
billions of dollars in government and private loans and those 
defaults have undermined the health of the federal agency that 
supports hundreds of other coops 
that agency the rural electrification administration channels 
lowinterest loans and other subsidies to americas electric 
coops coops owe the agency 20 billion but in its 1989 fiscal 
budget the rea anticipated as much as 10 percent of that amount 
206 billion wouldnt be repaid 
unlike privately owned utilities rural electric cooperatives 
are owned by the people who use them and are not run for profit 
there are about 1000 in the united states from tiny operations 
that provide power to a few scattered customers to larger outfits 
that serve hundreds of thousands 
only a small fraction are in serious trouble but nearly all 
have gotten lowinterest federal loans or federal guarantees for 
bank loans if coops dont pay back their rea loans the agency 
could have trouble repaying its own debt to the treasury 
department taxpayers would indirectly have to make up that lost 
money through an increased federal budget deficit 
eight rural electric coops currently are in default on 23 
billion in loans from the rea four of the eight are in chapter 11 
bankruptcy reorganization the eight also owe 125 billion to 
private creditors 
the rea itself must repay a 79 billion loan from the us 
treasury by 1993 
the rea charges only 5 percent interest on most loans to 
electric coops while it costs the treasury around 85 percent to 
borrow the money the rea lends because of the growing costs of the 
coop loans the reas loan from treasury is drifting toward 
insolvency according to ronald utt a washington economist 
without substantial reforms and with this treasury loan 
coming due a major taxpayer bailout will be needed to allow rea to 
continue operations utt concluded in a study published in june 
by the conservative heritage foundation 
in most cases the foundering coops were victims of oil price 
instability the farm slump of the mid1980s and a dose of 
overambition and overbuilding in one case a federal bankruptcy 
judge found the managers and directors of a big colorado coop 
incompetent and appointed an outside trustee to run it 
many coops were taking a gamble and unfortunately they were 
leaning on the federal government to finance their gamble said 
harold v hunter the head of the rea from 1981 through late 1988 
hunter noted that the biggest losses have been made by electric 
coops that got into the power generation business building 
expensive new plants until recently the coops stuck mainly to 
their traditional business of buying power in bulk from privately 
owned electric utilities 
in the 1970s and 1980s fearing potential oil shortages and high 
oil prices and wary of air quality regulations that made coal 
plants costly to run some coops turned to expensive nuclear 
power one of the biggest casualties of that policy was wabash 
valley power association inc of indianapolis now in bankruptcy 
reorganization it owes the rea 1 billion 
the rural electrification program a new deal legacy that stirs 
nearreligious fervor among its supporters was established to 
provide electric power to rural america with loans made or 
guaranteed by the federal government it revolutionized farming by 
powering refrigeration and liberating farmers from many burdensome 
hand chores 
but critics contend that the program stopped serving its purpose 
long ago and is a waste of taxpayers money they point to studies 
showing that most rea loans now go to finance projects in suburban 
rather than rural areas including new electric hookups in 
retirement communities and vacation resorts 
the rea also is tangled in lawsuits with some of its troubled 
coop borrowers 
in denver for example the agency filed a motion in us 
bankruptcy court against coloradoute electric association inc 
charging more than 60 instances of alleged mismanagement by coop 
officials us bankruptcy judge patricia clark recently appointed 
an outside trustee to take over management of the cooperative 
the bush administration looking for ways to cut the ballooning 
federal budget deficit has mounted a behindthescenes attack on 
the rea subsidies but those efforts are up against the powerful 
electric coop lobby and rural democrats in congress who control 
reas funding 
the current rea administrator is gary c byrne he took over 
last march the first banker to hold a position traditionally 
occupied by farmers and ranchers 
his mission is to make sure that all the loans are repaid 
to make sure we dont have another savings and loan crisis said 
stan lewandowski general manager of intermountain rural electric 
association inc of sedalia colo and a former rea official 
while the coops losses dont approach the magnitude of the 
500 billion sampl scandal they come at a time when the farm sector 
already has been shaken by a financial scare of its own the 
federal farm credit system which makes loans to farmers for crop 
production lost billions of dollars in the agricultural slump of 
the mid1980s and had to be bailed out by the taxpayers 
could the electric coop program suffer the same fate there 
is that possibility im sure said hunter the former rea chief 
wall street already has expressed its apprehension about the 
financial health of the electric coops an offshoot of the rea 
the national rural utilities cooperative finance corp sells 
bonds to private investors and uses the proceeds to make and 
guarantee loans 
earlier this year moodys investors service and standard amp 
poors lowered their ratings on some 4 billion in loans made or 
guaranteed by the cooperative finance corp it was the first such 
ratings move since 1984 
lower bond ratings usually lead to higher interest rates which 
can cost electric coops millions of extra dollars on their bank 
loans the coops often pass the cost on to customers in the form 
of higher electric rates thereby defeating one of the reas 
primary missions to provide cheap electricity to rural areas

hostages who were held as human shields at strategic points 
in iraq arrived in baghdad today and gathered at a luxury hotel as 
they prepared for their departures which iraqi officials said 
would be complete by christmas 
the first of the estimated 8000 foreign hostages were expected 
to leave on sunday and end their fourmonth ordeal two days after 
iraqs rubberstamp parliament approved president saddam husseins 
request to free them 
a group of 17 americans left iraq today with former treasury 
secretary john connally who was on a private visit to baghdad it 
appeared their release had been arranged prior to saddams pledge 
to free all captives 
us embassy officials said they were en route to ireland 
a group of 41 japanese men whose release was approved prior to 
thursday arrived in amman aboard a chartered iraqi airways 
jetliner 
nur eldin alsafi the head of iraqi airways said no foreign 
carriers would be allowed to fly the hostages out he said 
chartered iraqi airways flights could ferry them out within three 
days provided their travel documents were in order 
alsafi said us officials had chartered a boeing 707 to fly to 
kuwait sunday morning to pick up the americans he said the united 
states also chartered a boeing 747 to fly those americans and 
others in baghdad to frankfurt later sunday 
in groups of two or three the western hostages were ushered 
into the almansour melia hotel and whisked past jornalists by 
security agents the luxury hotel is known as hostage hotel 
because foreigners headed out of the country and into the iraqi 
hinterlands often passed through it 
we were treated well and did not encounter any hardships or 
problems but were packed and ready to go said david singleton 
50 of new orleans who was held for four months at an industrial 
site near mosul 250 miles north of the capital 
american officials had asked baghdad to allow the foreigners to 
leave without exit visas but iraqi officials said today it might 
take several days to process all the documents 
about 900 americans are among the estimated 8000 western east 
european and japanese hostages in iraq and occupied kuwait an 
estimated 600 of the foreigners were believed held at strategic 
sites to ward of an attack by us and other forces 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz said the processing of the 
foreigners which his government has insisted were guests and 
not hostages would be quick and he expected them all home for 
christmas 
but its not going to happen in one day aziz said in an 
interview on abcs nightline program friday night 
aziz also said foreigners in hiding since iraq invaded kuwait 
aug 2 have nothing to fear 
they can appear and leave the city of kuwait or come to 
baghdad he said 
the state department announced friday it will close its besieged 
mission in kuwait once the americans who wish to leave are free it 
denied the decision was a concession to iraqi demands that all 
embassies in kuwait close 
eight diplomats and other americans who sought refuge with them 
have been living on canned tuna and boiled water from the embassy 
swimming pool 
in august iraq ordered all missions in kuwait closed cutting 
off supplies to those refusing to comply only the british and 
american embassies have remained open in part to keep contact with 
their nationals hiding in kuwait 
in london the foreign office said its twodiplomat mission in 
kuwait will stay open 
us diplomats were faced with a dilemma today in considering a 
un security council resolution endorsing a mideast peace 
conference a veto could alienate arab allies while letting it 
pass would outrage israel and its jewish friends in america 
saddam has tried to link withdrawal of his troops from kuwait 
with israels abandonment of the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
something jerusalem flatly rejects 
the us mission got the security council to rush through a 
use of force resolution against iraq last week by assuring 
other council members it would go along with a resolution calling 
for an international conference to resolve strife in the 
israelioccupied territories 
aziz said passage of the resolution wouldnt end the gulf 
showdown anyway ive seen the draft of the resolution and it 
is a very weak one he said on nightline 
in calling for the hostages release saddam said thursday that 
he was responding to positive diplomatic overtures and that he no 
longer needed the hostages because enough of his forces were 
deployed in southern iraq and kuwait to ward off an attack 
about 480000 iraqi troops are said to be in the region facing 
a multinational force of about 350000 including 250000 us 
troops bush plans to expand the us deployment to more than 
400000 by midjanuary 
the aircraft carrier uss ranger and seven escort ships were 
leaving their home ports in san diego and long beach calif today 
for the middle east the pentagon announced the stuttgart 
germanybased us european command announced deployment of more 
f111 fighter planes to the gulf

seventeen american hostages left iraq today 
with former us treasury secretary john connally in a prelude to 
an exodus of foreigners expected to begin in earnest on sunday 
fortyone japanese also flew to freedom 
arrangements for the release of both groups apparently were made 
prior to the blanket release promised by iraq on friday 
the head of iraqi airways said today his airline was ready to 
fly out all foreign hostages within three days provided their 
travel documents were ready but he said no foreign carriers could 
transport them 
westerners formerly held as human shields at various 
locations throughout iraq arrived in baghdad hoping to leave the 
country as soon as possible 
were glad were here and were happy its over said dennis 
e howard 43 of port sulphur la who with another american was 
held for four months at an industrial site near mosul about 250 
miles north of the capital 
president saddam hussein said on thursday that the hostages 
should be released and the iraqi parliament approved the plan on 
friday 
iraqi officials said the 17 american hostages left baghdad on a 
us plane chartered by connally they were accompanied by eight 
relatives three us embassy personnel from kuwait and three 
americans who had been hiding out at an unidentified safe haven in 
baghdad 
the us embassy in amman said they were headed to ireland en 
route home 
the japanese arrived in amman jordan aboard a chartered iraqi 
airways jetliner accompanied by more than 60 relatives who had gone 
to baghdad to seek their release 
nur eldin alsafi the head of iraqi airways said american 
officials had chartered a boeing 707 to fly to kuwait sunday 
morning to pick up the americans he said the united states also 
chartered a boeing 747 to fly those americans and others in baghdad 
to frankfurt later sunday 
about 8000 westerners had been detained since iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait including about 600 who were held at strategic 
sites in an effort to deter any us attack 
the hostages included about 900 americans as well as other 
westerners eastern europeans and japanese 
there was no immediate indication when the hostages would be 
issued exit visas compulsory under iraqi law and government 
officials said it might take several days to process their 
documents 
dutch television reported today that all its hostages had been 
issued exit visas 
us embassy officials in baghdad said they had received no 
official notification of whether iraqi authorities might possibly 
waive the visa requirement to enable the detainees to leave sooner 
alsafi said the state airline would serve as the exclusive 
carrier for guests departing the country it has prepared a fleet 
of aircraft including boeing 747 jumbo jets to fly the hostages 
out he said in a telephone interview 
he said the italian government had chartered a boeing 707 to fly 
about 50 italians to rome on sunday however he said any 
britishchartered flight might not be able to go directly to london 
because iraq is afraid british authorities might seize the 
airliner 
a british airways boeing 747 that landed in kuwait before the 
aug 2 invasion is still being held by iraqi authorities 
alsafi said any british charter could however fly to another 
european point probably frankfurt or paris 
the americans were elated at the prospect of departure but 
still nervous about delays 
to say that were glad to be on our way out is an 
understatement said david singleton 50 of new orleans 
saddams call to release all hostages came one week after the 
un security council approved the resolution authorizing an attack 
on iraq after jan 15 if saddam fails to free the captives and 
withdraw his troops from kuwait 
about 480000 iraqi troops are said to be in southern iraq and 
kuwait facing a multinational force of about 350000 including 
250000 us troops bush plans to expand the us deployment to 
more than 400000 by midjanuary 
the state department announced friday that it will withdraw all 
eight diplomats from its beleaguered mission in kuwait once all the

the state department on saturday advised all 
americans to leave somalia as soon as possible because of growing 
chaos in the north african country 
the department also urged americans to defer all travel to 
somalia until it becomes safe 
communal violence is occurring in the city of mogadishu and 
violent crime and vehicle thefts are increasingly common a state 
of civil war exists in the countryside the department said in a 
prepared statement 
somalia a nation of 8 million on the horn of africa has been 
plagued by civil war for several years the situation worsened last 
year when the authoritarian government of president siad barre 
executed hundreds of moslems protesting the arrest of their 
religious leader 
at least 20 people have been killed since dec 2 in violence in 
the capital of mogadishu the state department said 
soldiers and civilians have been looting government warehouses 
for food and guerrillas and troops have been exchanging 
rocketpropelled grenades 
a somali who works for the us embassy was wounded dec 3 when 
he drove into an area of mogadishu where fighting was going on the 
department said 
although no americans have been injured the wives of us 
ambassador james k bishop and of another diplomat were recently 
robbed at gunpoint 
the state department said it was allowing all nonessential us 
personnel at the embassy to leave it urged private americans who 
choose to remain to keep in close touch with the embassy 
sixtysix government personnel remain in mogadishu along with 
54 of their dependents there are also about 200 private americans 
in the country the state department said 
with the nearcollapse of the government soldiers supplement 
their meager pay with nightly forays into residential neighborhoods 
darkened by lack of electricity 
the city also is jammed with thousands of refugees from fighting 
in the northern central and southern parts of somalia 
barres government promised a national referendum for oct 23 on 
a proposed new constitution but the vote was postponed 
indefinitely 
critics say the referendum would be meaningless because the 
government could not conduct a vote in the vast areas it no longer 
controls 
barre also proposed discussions with critics and armed 
opponents two of the three major insurgent groups agreed to 
attend however the presidents enemies still are demanding his 
departure as a first step in a solution

in unmarked tents under 
camouflage nets or in mess halls american soldiers are discreetly 
holding religious services and making plans for christmas and 
hanukkah 
religion is a delicate issue for the us military which has 
chaplains in its combat battalions to meet the spiritual needs of 
its soldiers 
saudi arabia a kingdom whose laws are based on the koran the 
moslem holy book bans all religions except islam 
what has evolved since operation desert shield began early in 
august is a compromise under which worship is accepted if there 
are no outward displays 
its not as if were trying to push our religious feelings off 
on them said lt jackie jones 25 of springfield va from the 
18th airborne corps 
some of us feel that if these people invited us here to help 
them defend their country let us be ourselves why should we have 
to pretend to be something were not 
the us joint information bureau in saudi arabia does not allow 
news coverage of church services because of saudi sensitivities 
taking photographs of chapels is forbidden chaplains renamed 
morale officers have been told not to give interviews 
codes are used to advertise services cword morale 
services for roman catholic mass or jword for a jewish 
service some chaplains cover the crosses on their uniforms and 
combat helmets or even remove them 
to me that cross is a symbol of what i am and who i am 
said a protestant chaplain with the 82nd airborne division 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
it offended me that i would have to hide who i am but in 
retrospect if it was the only means of carrying out our mission as 
chaplains no sacrifice is too great 
in a quiet unassuming way the soldiers are being ministered 
to we dont draw attention to what were doing but were able to 
provide 
some units are organizing choral groups and making plans for 
midnight mass on christmas eve prechristmas services already are 
being held 
dec 9 is the second of four sundays of advent when christians 
mark the coming of jesus by lighting candles in a wreath 
at sundown dec 11 jews will light the first of eight candles 
for hanukkah 
many secular signs of the holidays can be found in the desert 
artificial christmas trees adorn bunkers foxholes offices and 
hospital wards but there are no outside displays 
there are figures of frosty the snowman englishlanguage 
christmas cards and strands of twinkling lights have even appeared 
in saudi stores 
we may have carried this cultural awareness thing a bit too 
far said lt col gary wilson commander of a marine recreation 
area where sunday services are held in a movie theater 
a saudi government official speaking anonymouysly said its 
okay as long as they keep to their designated areas and as long as 
they dont impose their beliefs on others 
americans who work for the aramco oil company have held private 
services in their homes for years 
religion assumes greater importance not only because of the 
holiday season but because american soldiers are confronting their 
own mortality 
capt ba arnold an air force chaplain from cannon air force 
base in clovis nm used the classic phrase there are no 
atheists in foxholes 
marine cpl nathan lee 30 of jasper ga said he had turned 
to his baptist roots 
i never thought about it much before but its become more 
important he said i could get killed over here i feel i 
should make my peace with god 
cpl michael flaga 25 of mchenry ill said attendance has 
been high at weekly bible study for nondenominational christians 
he is protestant lay leader for the 3rd battalion 9th marine 
regiment 
how can they possibly make someone stop he said were 
out in the middle of the desert we have all the privacy we need 
we could run from hooch to hooch screaming hallelujah and no one 
would hear us

a law creating 74 new trial judgeships will 
help some federal courts better cope with a flood of drugrelated 
prosecutions judicial officials say and the added help will 
eliminate some long delays in civil lawsuits that one judge says 
are lying there vegetating 
the law boosts the number of federal trial judges nationwide 
from 575 to 649 as of 1991 federal appellate judgeships will climb 
from 168 to 179 
these are the first additions since 1984 and in that period 
the caseloads particularly the number of drugrelated criminal 
cases have risen dramatically said david sellers of the 
administrative office of us courts 
the us judicial conference the federal judiciarys 
policymaking board does not think 85 new judges are enough it 
had requested that congress create 96 new posts 
in the political giveandtake of getting the law enacted some 
judges were put in places where little need exists places such as 
utah wyoming new hampshire and maine 
but it appears that much of the help is headed for those areas 
of the country that most need the help the southern district of 
texas for example 
stretched across a 45county area of the lone star state that 
includes the cities of houston laredo and brownsville the 
southern district is being expanded from 13 to 18 trial judges 
all of us have more than we can say grace over this is going 
to be a tremendous boon said james deanda the districts 
houstonbased chief judge 
weve had amazingly large increases in our criminal docket 
deanda said led by a dramatic upsurge in drug cases because of 
the priority given to criminal cases due to the speedy trial act 
we just are not giving any attention at all to our civil docket 
civil cases are lying there vegetating 
the statistics are staggering of all the federal drug 
prosecutions nationwide in 1989 13 percent 1662 of them were 
filed in texas southern district where 2 percent of all federal 
trial judges work 
that district handled more than twice the number of drug cases 
of the district in second place western texas the same 
percentages are true for 1990 
as a result the average number of civil cases on a texas 
southern district judges docket is approaching 700 
all this and out there somewhere are lurking all those savings 
and loan cases we havent seen the tip of the iceberg yet 
deanda said adding that his district already needs two more than 
the five judges it is getting 
only one other district the san franciscobased central 
district in california is receiving as many as five additional 
judges it has 22 
in all 32 states are receiving at least one additional federal 
trial judge 
nationally i suspect well nee more as soon as the first of 
these positions is filled the administrative offices sellers 
said its the nature of the business

the houses voting record was a bit more 
conservative this year and would have been even more so had it not 
been for a major vote that paired conservative republicans with 
liberal democrats against president bushs budget plan a survey 
released saturday shows 
the americans for democratic action said that on a scale of 0 to 
100 the liberal quotient in the house was 49 percent on 
average down from 50 percent in 1989 
among democrats the quotient was 71 percent down two 
percentage points from 1989 republicans liberal rating increased 
from 15 percent to 19 percent because democrats outnumber 
republicans in the house the overall quotient declined 
twentynine members of the house received perfect scores of 100 
from the ada based on their voting records on such issues as civil 
rights defense spending the budget abortion rights and campaign 
finance reform 
that was an increase of four from the previous year and a jump 
of 13 since 1988 
rep don edwards dcalif headed the liberal list receiving a 
perfect score for the eighth straight year reps lane evans 
dill and robert kastenmeier dwis were awarded scres of 100 
for the fifth consecutive year 
kastenmeier was defeated in his bid for reelection last month 
rep ronald dellums dcalif received a 100 score for the 
fourth consecutive year while rep gerry studds dmass was 
awarded a score of 100 for the third time in three years 
thirteen members received scores of zero including reps edward 
madigan rill larry combest rtexas william dickinson rala 
and bill archer rtexas 
more members would have scored zero on the ada rating but for 
their votes on the initial budget resolution that drew the ire of 
liberal democrats and conservative republicans 
thirtyone traditionally conservative members supported the 
liberal position in opposition to the summit budget resolution 
said amy isaacs national director of the ada 
this entire group was saved from getting a zero liberal 
quotient when they rejected the irresponsible budget compromise 
she said 
fiftyseven percent of democrats scored 70 or more down from 68 
percent in 1989 twentynine percent of democrats scored between 40 
and 69 up from 22 percent last year 
two percent of republicans scored more than 70 down from 3 
percent in 1989 ten percent of republicans scored between 40 and 
69 an increase from 8 percent in 1989 
massachusetts ranked as the most liberal state with an average 
score of 85 delaware was second with 78 connecticut third at 72 
north dakota fourth at 72 and new york fifth at 71 percent 
wyoming was the most conservative at 11 percent new hampshire 
had 12 percent louisiana 21 percent alabama 24 percent and idaho

serbia and montenegro the last 
communistruled yugoslav republics on sunday hold multiparty 
elections that could decide whether the country stays together or 
disintegrates 
in the countrys largest republic serbia the first free vote 
in more than 50 years pits the socialists formerly the communists 
against a host of centerright nationalist parties 
in traditionally procommunist montenegro the countrys 
smallest republic the vote is being contested by the ruling 
communists and 10 other parties including some who seek union with 
neighboring serbia 
in the struggle to shape the countrys future the western 
republics of croatia and slovenia where centerright parties 
ousted communists in spring elections want more independence from 
the federation and have threatened to secede 
they are pitted against serbia and montenegro whose politicians 
generally favor a strong central government although some have 
accepted the possibility that the country could break up 
the race between socialist leader slobodan milosevic and his 
bitter rival vuk draskovic of the serbian renewal movement for 
serbias powerful presidency is the most important in sundays 
elections 
milosevic has so far refused to negotiate with rival croatia and 
slovenia on the countrys future but draskovic has suggested there 
might be no stopping the countrys breakup 
if i become president i would immediately negotiate with 
croatia and slovenia in order to deflate this horrible balloon of 
hatred in yugoslavia draskovic said in a recent interview if 
we fail to reach an agreement about living together we will set up 
separate states 
the serbian reneval movement poses the biggest challenge to the 
socialists it demands the restoration of capitalism and the return 
of serbias glory as a dominant balkan state 
the outcome of the vote in serbia could decide a decadelong 
struggle for power in yugoslavia which is being wracked by ethnic 
and political tensions between its six constituent republics and 
two provinces 
with tensions in yugoslavia running high us intelligence has 
predicted the country could split in 18 months and civil war could 
break out 
milosevic and draskovic face 30 lesser rivals running for 
serbias presidency 
also at stake are 250 seats in the republics parliament which 
are contested by 44 parties 
preelection polls indicated the socialists were slightly ahead 
of draskovics party but they also indicated nearly 40 percent of 
the republics 6865445 eligible voters were still undecided 
serbias opposition claims that the republics acrimonious 
election campaign has claimed five lives the socialists say those 
were not politically motivated deaths 
opposition leaders repeatedly have alleged that the socialists 
were preparing to rig the elections to stay in power they say that 
since april the communist authorities have stopped registering 
deaths in serbia to enter the nonexisting votes in the coming 
elections 
the socialists deny any wrongdoing 
in last years singleparty serbian elections unregistered 
voters who in some cases were under age were allowed to cast 
ballots as a result milosevic won with 104 percent of the votes 
in some areas 
polls open at 7 am and close 12 hours later first official 
results of the elections in the two republics are expected early 
this week 
runoff elections in all districts where one candidate did not 
get at least 50 percent of the votes are scheduled for dec 23

with allies and the coalition sort of a political read before 
the trip can be finalized the official said

a diplomatic purpose as well as moralebuilding for the us forces 
who have to spend christmas in the desert

president bush encountered scattered 
antiamerican protests during his fivecountry south america but 
the worst example of turbulence occurred at 30000 feet on his 
flight from argentina to chile 
approaching the andes mountains on thursday the buffeting was 
so bad that a secret service agent flying in a backup plane was 
hurled against the ceiling and broke the arm of a seat on the way 
down he also suffered a back injury 
the pilot of the lead plane in the convoy carrying the news 
media said it was one of the worst cases of turbulence he had seen 
in 30 years of flying he blamed the wind shifts on distortions 
caused by the andes 
having been forewarned by the press plane pilot the bush party 
aboard air force one was strapped in tight during the 10minute 
ordeal presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said it was strange 
to see the hefty craft being tossed around like a piper cub

speaking of heights bushs rhetoric on this trip has been 
absolutely soaring he has a ready answer for critics who accuse 
him of a lack of vision read my south america speeches he 
told the brazilian congress all of us have been galvanized by a 
new era of hope and opportunity throughout the americas in 
argentina he spoke of a new dawn in a new world in chile 
let us join together to work toward this new world of progress 
and hope for all the peoples of the americas 
bushs host here president carlos andres perez is no slouch 
when it comes to rhetorical fluorishes calling latin america an 
essential port of the new worldyearning to become an integral 
part of that other new world that awakens to the dawn of a 
stimulating hopeful final decade of the last century in the 
second millenium of mankind 
meanwhile the rhetoric of leftist opponents of bushs visit had 
a vaguely familiar ring leaflets passed out in uruguay called bush 
the representative of the superexploitation of our peoples and 
of the violence expressed in the invasions of panama grenada and 
the occupation of the persian gulf

its about a twohour drive from the uruguayan capital of 
montevideo to the resort city of punta del este a relatively 
simple trek for most people when a us president makes that kind 
of trip it becomes a major production since there is no large 
airport in punta del este the presidents helicopter marine one 
was made available for the occasion along with a halfdozen army 
black hawk helicopters flown in from fort ord calif for staff 
and the press pool 
lots of manhours went into preparations for the 30minute 
copter ride to punta del este for bush the net result of all 
these labors was a jog along the beach and a dip in the atlantic 
surf time consumed about a half hour the next morning he 
boarded marine one again for the 1 hour and 40 minute ride to 
buenos aires

the same high oil prices that sent the 
nations economy tottering into recession have left louisiana with 
a problem most state governments wish they had a budget surplus 
while new york california and other states are being forced to 
make painful budget cuts louisiana officials are haggling over 
what to do with as much as 400 million in surplus money and with 
years of pinched budgets and deficit financing forced on the state 
by the oil bust of the 80s there is no shortage of ideas for what 
to do with the windfall 
louisianas economy usually bucks trends in the rest of the 
nation said charles pasqua executive director of the louisiana 
municipal association 
when were in good shape they go down pasqua said when 
theyre in their heyday were at our low ebb 
the states preliminary unemployment rate for october dropped to 
6 percent only slightly above the national average after 
skyrocketing above 13 percent during the late 1980s when the rest 
of the nation was enjoying the longest economic boom in decades 
a battle is looming in the legislature on how to use the surplus 
to make up for deficits and unmet needs that are left over from the 
worst times since the great depression 
gov buddy roemer has said part of the projected surplus could 
be used to help retire about 900 million in bonds sold in 1987 to 
help retire the states accumulated deficit 
the governor also has said he intends use at least 50 million 
to bump salaries at state colleges and universities up to the 
average of southern states 
also school support workers school bus drivers and other vocal 
groups want raises and state workers want the legislature to work 
toward retiring the 6 billion deficit in the state retirement 
system 
louis lambert a democrat who plans to challenge roemer also a 
democrat next year said the windfall should be used to get rid of 
1 cent of the state sales tax 
state lawmakers also are hearing cries from local governments 
which have suffered from a 500 million decrease in federal and 
state aid over the past five years 
reductions weve had in state aid over the past few years puts 
us second to last in the states as far as state assistance to local 
governments pasqua said yeah were hurting 
local officials want relief from five years of financial chaos 
that has reduced many parish roads to beatenup paths restricted 
police and fire protection and left some local governments 
virtually destitute 
problems often worsen because local governments in louisiana 
have little authority to raise money on their own they must travel 
to baton rouge each year and lobby for money and the authority to 
raise taxes 
tangipahoa parish for example had a severe financial crisis in 
1988 and 1989 but roemer refused to let the parish louisianas 
equivalent of a county file for bankruptcy protection because he 
was afraid of the effect it would have on the states bond rating 
voters finally approved enough taxes to keep the parish running 
pasqua said city governments are reporting increases in sales 
tax revenues and in building permits indicating an upturn but 
things still arent good 
james t hays executive secretary of the louisiana police jury 
association said an improved state economy should help local 
governments but they still will have a hard time digging out of 
the hole a police jury is the rough equivalent of a county 
council 
the voters out there have seen state government raise taxes 
and it makes it difficult for local governments to raise taxes 
hays said along with inflation all of these things coupled 
together have put the parishes in a severe financial strain 
after next year the state wont have to decide what to do with 
extra money from booming oil prices effective july 1 revenues 
from oil at more than 22 per barrel will go into a highly 
restricted fund that can be used only to pay off state debt and 
reduce the deficit in the retirement system

dozens of fans of rock legend and 
former beatle john lennon gathered in the snow on a windy saturday 
for a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of his death 
liverpools mayor dorothy gavin led lennon devotees who laid 
wreaths at the foot of a bronze statue of the beatles in the citys 
cavern walks shopping center 
the center was built on the original site of the cavern club 
made famous when the beatles played there in the 1960s and has 
become a place of pilgrimage 
give peace a chance the title of one of singersongwriter 
lennons greatest hits was the theme for the day 
many friends and followers of lennon were present including 
father tom mckenzie immortalized as father mackenzie in the 
beatles l966 hit song eleanor rigby 
on friday a small group of invited guests had gathered at 
liverpools beatles museum to watch mrs gavin unveil a plaque 
marking the 10th anniversary of lennons death 
john was always a son of liverpool and over the last 10 years 
liverpool has been very slow to recognize the fact that the beatles 
came from liverpool said lennon biographer ray coleman after the 
unveiling 
it is right that a world figure like lennon should be 
recognized at last said coleman author of john lennon 
lennon and his wife yoko ono were returning to their apartment 
in new yorks dakota apartment building after a recording session 
on dec 8 1980 when lennon was shot to death by mark david 
chapman a deranged fan to whom lennon had given his autograph only 
hours before lennon was 40 
a spokesman for the lennon family said ms ono and the couples 
son sean were in europe and would spend the anniversary 
privately 
journalist andy peebles the last person to interview lennon 
before he was shot said in an interview with sky satellitetelevision news 
ten years on its a ghastly feeling to think 
that you had spent seven hours with somebody you have been 
a fan of for years and i think i left thinking this is great 
hes in really good shape 
peebles said late in 1980 that lennon had just recovered from a 
period when he had gone off the rails and his relationship with 
ms ono had suffered but when i saw him theyd had the baby 
sean had been born and everything was great

columbias problemplagued 
astronomy mission encountered more trouble today when lines to 
remove waste water from the shuttle became clogged and nasa 
considered shortening the flight by a day or two 
there was no danger to the crew but nasa quickly put into place 
plans for handling the shuttles constantly growing supply of waste 
water 
randy stone chief of nasas flight director office said it was 
doubtful the shuttle would have to return to earth on sunday and 
that monday was a more likely scenario the 10day mission was not 
supposed to end until tuesday night 
were hopeful well get to 10 days but from where we stand 
right now im not terribly optimistic that we can make it until 
then stone said certainly we wont give up on that because we 
want to maximize the science were getting out of the mission 
the astronauts already have had to scrap more than a third of 
250 planned observations of galaxies supernovas and other objects 
because of prior problems with nasas 150 million astro 
observatory the newly developed water line problem was not 
affecting this mornings scientific work 
after the lines to remove waste water from a tank aboard the 
shuttle were found to be blocked crew members tried purging the 
lines with air the astronauts said they succeeded in removing some 
debris but there was still partial blockage 
mission control instructed astronaut mike lounge to hook up a 
large rubber bag to remove some waste water from the tank before 
lounge began the task this morning the tank was about twothirds 
full and would have been at capacity within 20 hours if current 
water usage rates had continued 
the transfer to the bag should provide another 40 hours of 
flight time the astronauts were also cutting waste water buildup 
by using urine collection bags instead of the toilet nasa said 
but two days are needed as contingency time for landing the shuttle 
in case a problem like bad weather at landing sites forced a delay 
officials were hesitant to dump any water from the tank through 
the blocked lines because the water might freeze before it reached 
heaters and result in a more clogging hartsfield said 
scientists who have endured equipment failure throughout the 
mission said they naturally will be disappointed if the mission 
must be shortened 
we feel now that things are going rather well we would be 
very disappointed but we also understand thats also the way the 
mission works said warren moos part of the johns hopkins 
university telescope team if theres something that endangers 
the spacecraft you simply have no choice 
the latest problem sprang up just after scientists said friday 
that the mission appeared to be back on track and they were excited 
about results so far even with the delays caused by the problems 
earlier in the mission 
we just keep coming back said chris anderson a member of 
the scientific team on the ground monitoring one of the telescopes 
weve worked together in bringing this thing back from what 
looks like absolute disaster to go on 
unless the newly developed problem changes their plans this 
afternoon the seven astronauts planned to try to spot the galileo 
spacecraft as it passes by earth using the planets gravity like a 
slingshot to boost it along on its sixyear journey to jupiter 
galileo was to fly about 2484 miles above the shuttle today 
observations were halted for half a day thursday when a computer 
terminal aboard columbia overheated and shut down the only other 
onboard terminal capable of operating the astro had failed sunday 
earlier in the week the astronauts lost observing time because 
of problems with the system that points the observatorys three 
ultraviolet telescopes 
nasa solved the problems by having scientists on the ground 
activate and point the telescopes then having the astronauts focus 
them on exact targets by using a joystick and following directions 
from the ground 
now were making so much progress its unbelievable said 
arthur davidsen of johns hopkins university principal investigator 
for one of the telescopes 
a fourth groundcontrolled xray telescope with a separate 
pointing system has operated well throughout most of the mission 
scientists used it friday to discover evidence of a black hole in a 
galaxy 325 million light years away 
that tells us that indeed there are likely to be giant black 
holes at the centers of these galaxies said peter serlemitsos a 
scientist at goddard space flight center in greenbelt md 
the ultraviolet telescopes were used to observe several objects 
friday including supernovas several galaxies and the planet 
jupiter 
the four astronomers on columbia discussed the missions earlier 
problems during a televised science lesson conducted friday from 
the spacecraft for 41 middle school students gathered at nasa 
centers in alabama and maryland 
unfortunately weve had some failures with computer terminals 
which have caused us to have to redo the way that we operate this 
mission astronaut ron parise said so its been quite tedious 
and timeconsuming to figure out how to do that 
but were slowly working around everything and were getting 
science data and doing our job he said 
more than 250 observations were originally planned for the 
mission but many lowpriority targets were scrapped because of the 
problems 
nasa officials said it was not known how many objects would be 
viewed before the mission ends tuesday however by thursdays 
computer failure only 70 of a revised list of 187 observations had 
been completed 
the telescopes are designed to study ultraviolet rays and xrays 
from some of the hottest and most violent objects in the universe 
those rays are invisible to ground instruments because they are 
absorbed by earths atmosphere

while supporters and critics at home cheer 
president bushs decision to seek talks with iraq some of his 
allies abroad are eyeing a peaceful end to the crisis with distinct 
trepidation saddam will be back to get us said one 
the allies in europe fear that while bushs lips say no to 
negotiations his actions imply yes and the allies in the 
persian gulf say negotiations may get iraqi president saddam 
hussein out of kuwait but they wont get him off their backs 
publicly the allies expressed relief when president bush 
announced 10 days ago that secretary of state james a baker iii 
will go to baghdad it appeared the united states appeared to have 
pulled back from the brink of war 
but privately us european allies expressed anger at not being 
consulted or forewarned of the proposed baker trip said a french 
diplomat who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
and the gulf allies also upset at not being consulted voiced a 
greater concern that while iraq still may be forced to pull out of 
kuwait its millionstrong military and abundant conventional and 
nonconventional arsenals will remain a heavy menace on their 
borders 
he has said this clearly saddam will be back to get us 
rashed alrashed former kuwaiti minister of state for cabinet 
affairs said in an interview last week 
alrashed who is touring the united states to explain the 
position of the exiled kuwaiti leadership said he hoped saddam 
will be toppled by iraqi opposition forces within one year after he 
loses kuwait the kuwaiti leadership is supporting the iraqi 
opposition organizing abroad he said 
in the meantime even if saddam pulls out the allies will have 
to maintain an embargo to prevent anything but food and medicine 
from reaching iraq and strengthening his control alrashed said 
us analysts dont believe iraqs opposition is strong enough 
to pose a threat to saddam but baker and other top administration 
officials are aware of the threat saddam will pose in the 
postwithdrawal era 
baker has discussed with the allies creation of a regional 
security force to deter iraqi attack he has also said the allies 
will have to devise sanctions to prevent iraq from acquiring the 
kind of technology it needs to bolster its chemical and biological 
weapons and develop its fledgling nuclear capabilities 
but this could be a slow and futile battle 
the gulf neighbors ultimate concern is the threat saddam 
poses to their regimes said marvin feuerwerger an analyst with 
the washington institute of near east policy he has a long 
memory their greatest fear is hell target them and bring them 
down 
egypt which has committed a large contingent to the 
multinational force in saudi arabia also has mixed feelings about 
bushs actions even though it isnt an immediate neighbor of iraq 
to agree to sit down with iraq before it implements any of the 
international communitys demands is tantamount to acquiescing to 
iraqi dictates the official alahram newspaper said in a recent 
editorial 
the move elevates saddams status in the arab world the 
newspaper said and it could limit and shackle americas freedom 
of action under the watchful gaze of an expectant world 
first indications of such a limitation came when saddam clearly 
catching the administration by surprise announced thursday he 
would let more than 8000 foreigners leave kuwait and iraq 
the administration couldnt do anything but say it was happy 
even while knowing saddam was manipulating the situation said a 
western diplomat who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
bush appears aware of this ploy in reacting to first word of 
the hostage release bush told reporters in santiago chile that 
he would not give saddam a facesaving way out of the crisis 
and that iraq would still have to comply with un demands for its 
unconditional withdrawal 
bush said saturday in caracas venezuela that departure of 
american hostages and diplomats from iraq and kuwait will make it 
easier to go to war if saddam refuses to pull out of kuwait 
thats just one less worry ive got bush told a news 
conference when asked about his decision to withdraw the remaining 
handful of diplomats from the us embassy in kuwait 
another us ally that is clearly and publicly unhappy with 
bushs decision to talk to iraq is israel which saddam has 
repeatedly threatened with annihilation 
frustrated at being denied membership in the antiiraq 
coalition israel nonetheless agreed to sit on the sidelines as

environmentalists are making new waves over the 
issue of dolphins dying in tuna nets accusing a us canner of 
lying about its commitment to dolphinsafe policies 
the company bumble bee seafoods inc denied the allegations 
and said it was the target of a misleading campaign 
fullpage advertisements placed in major newspapers by the san 
franciscobased earth island institute urged consumers to boycott 
bumble bee products saying alone among the three major canners 
bumble bee has lied bout its corporate connection to the netting 
and drowning of dolphins 
the ads appeared tuesday in the los angeles times the san 
francisco chronicle and the san francisco examiner and wednesday 
in the new york times 
on friday san diegobased bumble bee a subsidiary of unicord 
co ltd and the nations thirdlargest tuna canner responded with 
its own ads saying earth island has mounted a campaign against 
bumble bee which included false and misleading statements it 
is time to set the record straight bumble bee is dolphinsafe 
we are being lambasted by earth island as they try to 
grandstand in the twilight of this issue to generate 
contributions said mark koob president of bumble bee and 
its absolutely irresponsible 
thats the typical cynical response of a desperate man said 
samuel labudde earth island research biologist were in this 
for one reason only and thats to save dolphins 
in april bumble bee starkist and chicken of the sea brands 
announced that they would no longer buy or sell tuna caught with 
dolphins environmentalists had estimated that more than 100000 
dolphins died each year in huge nets used to catch tuna in the 
eastern pacific ocean 
hj heinzowned starkist the worlds largest tuna canner and 
chicken of the sea a product of van kamp seafood and the 
secondlargest implemented the policy immediately but bumble bee 
said it would take six months to phase out its contracts with boats 
that caught dolphins with tuna 
by creating this sixmonth window for themselves they used it 
as an opportunity to buy a lot of cheap dolphinunsafe tuna and 
engaged in a deception where they were putting these dolphinsafe 
labels on individual cans of tuna while the company was anything 
but dolphinsafe labudde said 
there have been fish caught in connection with dolphin during 
the transition period yes that fact has been disclosed and its a 
matter of public record koob said 
all bumble bee tuna labeled dolphinsafe was just that he 
added 
earth island observers said that after the transition period 
expired in october bumble bee purchased 2600 tons of tuna caught 
with dolphins that had been rejected by other canners including 
starkist the company then resold it labudde said 
koob said that unicord did buy the cargo but he called the 
purchase a mistake and said it was quickly resold 
we have so many different stories from unicord and bumble bee 
officials concerning this shipment of 2600 tons of tuna that its 
really difficult to say what happened labudde said it doesnt 
even appear that they know themselves theyve changed their story 
so many times 
labudde who boarded a tuna boat three years ago and documented 
thousands of dolphin deaths denied that earth island was acting 
vindictively 
were taking them to task because theyve lied and deceived 
the environmental community he said and we feel like they 
have through their actions demonstrated their absolute contempt for 
the environmental community the american consumer and for the 
concept of dolphinsafe tuna 
koob said the company would decide in a week whether to take 
legal action against earth island for its statements 
i do believe theyre going to hurt us he said but i also 
know this is a quality company with a quality brand and quality 
people weve been through tough times before well get through 
this

defense secretary dick cheney has banned 
permanently the peacetime loading of currentmodel shortrange 
nuclear missiles onto strategic aircraft placed on alert a 
pentagon spokesman said saturday 
the decision to ground the shortrange attack missilea or 
srama was based on concerns that an accident could result in 
plutonium dust an extraordinarily potent cancercauser being 
spread over a large area 
cheney issued a temporary order june 8 barring the missile from 
being loaded on b52 b1 and fb111 bombers after the directors of 
three nuclear weapons laboratories expressed fears over the 
remote possibility of such an accident in testimony to 
congress 
his decision to make the ban permanent follows an internal air 
force and energy department assessment that substantiated the 
scientists concerns according to air force lt col rick oborn 
the order does not prohibit other nuclear weapons including 
longerrange missiles and gravity bombs from being loaded aboard 
any of the nations 372 strategic bombers while they are on 
ground alert status nor will it prohibit loading a safer 
replacement for the srama the sram2 when it is eady for 
deployment in 1993 
the air force has said 1500 of the sramas were produced 
between 1971 and 1975 but the current number deployed is 
classified the washington post reported saturday that hundreds of 
the missiles are located at 13 bases in nine states oborn declined 
to discuss locations of either domestic or overseas deployments 
the srama is a 14foot airtosurface missile armed with a 
w69 nuclear warhead with an estimated explosive yield of 170000 
tons of tnt or 11 to 13 times the power of the bomb that destroyed 
hiroshima in 1945 
defense writers have said it is designed for use against targets 
that threaten the bombers themselves such as radar stations 
fighter bases and antiaircraft missile sites and have estimated 
its range at 100 miles 
the safety concern is focused on whether accidental aircraft 
fires could detonate the conventional explosives surrounding the 
missiles nuclear core and that the blast could disperse the 
highly lethal plutonium such an accident scientists say would 
pose no risk of actually detonating the weapon 
the weapon has not been carried aboard b52s b1s or fb111s on 
training missions rather it has been loaded only on aircraft 
assigned to ground alert meaning they are armed fueled and ready 
to fly within minutes usually stationed near the end of a runway 
for quick takeoff in the event of a crisis the number of planes on 
such alert is classified 
oborn said the sramas will remain at storage facilities where 
they still could be loaded and used in the event of actual war

scott riddle is making a home where the 
elephants roam where he and the pachyderms can play three of 
them weighing at least 4000 pounds each lumber around his farm 
where cows once grazed 
riddle has trained elephants for 26 years for circuses movies 
and advertising now the veteran of the los angeles zoo and other 
zoos is establishing a breeding farm and sanctuary for elephants on 
his 330acre spread in arkansas 
hes an unusual man said tony valenzuela curator of 
mammals at the los angeles zoo and a member of the board of 
riddles organization 
last fall riddle left his home in melbourne fla for quitman 
ark he and his wife heidi packed up their two children in the 
family motor home and mary mugsy and solomon climbed into their 
custombuilt trailer 
mary a 16yearold asian elephant has been with riddle for 
half of her life she was deemed untrainable when he found her but 
now children climb aboard her for rides at the little rock zoo 
his other two elephants are from africa where they had faced 
death in a culling or herdthinning operation riddle who 
disagrees with culling said baby elephants that can be sold are 
spared 
thats how solomon and mugsy ended up in florida riddle said 
they had been bought by a wealthy man who wanted a bunch of 
elephants when the novelty wore thin for the prior owner riddle 
acquired them about five years ago 
besides beginning a breeding program riddle plans to take in 
other orphan elephants we will open the door to any elephant 
that needs a home he said and i think that people will call 
us 
but its costly to run an elephant farm riddle estimated the 
weekly cost of keeping one elephant runs about 100 he established 
a nonprofit corporation last summer to seek donations 
sponsorships and memberships 
were the only nonprofit corporation dedicated solely to 
elephants i believe in the world the animal business is 
getting very hard because of the position in the world of the 
animals especially elephants getting extinct he said 
poaching culling and loss of habitat are the greatest threats 
to the elephants survival said riddle who calls for a lifting of 
limits on importation of elephants to this country 
at his farm riddle plans to offer instruction on basic handling 
of elephants youd be surprised how many people in the public 
want to do it he said 
im not a bleeding heart but i think if we can save one 
elephant we can accomplish something if we save one person from 
being hurt weve accomplished something because elephants can be 
dangerous he said 
riddle ranks elephants alongside dolphins and the great apes in 
intelligence 
ive been around elephants long enough to know that they are 
very very intelligent he said they have a very intricate 
social structure they discipline their young 
they think they reason they plan

president hussain muhammad ershads 
resignation last week came after his generals withdrew their 
support for his embattled regime a senior aide to the ousted 
president said saturday 
ershad feared the military would stage a coup unless he bowed to 
the unrelenting pressure of massive public demonstrations demanding 
his immediate resignation the aide said 
ershad a former general who seized power in 1982 and ruled 
under military law for four years announced tuesday that he was 
stepping down following seven weeks of street protests that the 
army failed to quell 
initially we didnt take it the protests seriously said 
the source one of the seven people in ershads inner circle during 
his final days in office 
the president expected the army to contain the unrest as it had 
before but ershad had lost touch with the military which was 
his main constituency said the former government official 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
the backstage role of the army which had been ershads source 
of power for eight years had been a mystery the campaign against 
him was led by university students and a newly united alliance of 
opposition political parties 
periodic campaigns to to oust ershad were always undermined by 
the rivalries within the opposition this time the pace of dissent 
was set by dhaka university students who defied curfews to keep up 
the pressure 
ershad had become overconfident and complacent about the 
military said the source particularly after his decision to 
send 2000 troops to join the usled multinational force in the 
persian gulf 
as late as nov 27 ershad felt certain he could suppress the 
public discontent by declaring a state of emergency and calling on 
the army and paramilitary forces to impose order 
but after clashing with demonstrators for two days the military 
stopped intervening soldiers watched passively while thousands of 
people paraded in the streets of dhaka in defiance of a curfew and 
the emergency rules 
who took that decision i dont know said the former 
official when we asked the president about it he said all 
right im looking into it and ill see about it he didnt 
have the total picture of the situation 
by monday ershad realized he had lost the aide said the 
official said ershad believed further resistance would destroy the 
nations feeble economy would mean widespread killing and likely 
would require imposing martial law which he vowed in 1986 never to 
do again 
in a televised address he caved in to opposition demands to 
hand over power to a caretaker government that would supervise 
elections he said he would quit 15 days before registering 
candidates or at least 45 days before election day 
expecting jubilant celebrations ershad was stunned when the 
opposition spurned his offer and insisted he quit immediately the 
former official said 
on tuesday the general staff commanders informed ershad they 
would no longer support him the source said we thought they 
would try to take over said the source ershad hastily drew up 
his resignation announcement which was read on the state 
television that evening 
the former official and other sources said ershad seemed unaware 
that discontent in the military had been building junior officers 
were unhappy with what they saw as ershads patronagebased 
promotions and constant changes of the army command 
the political opposition led by sheik hasina and khaleda zia 
accused ershad of being a military dictator although ershad had 
resigned from the army in 1986 the officers were growing 
increasingly uncomfortable with the public anger directed at them 
two weeks ago a large group of officers met to discuss the 
political situation the official said dissenting views came out 
for the first time we should have read the writing on the wall

whenever barbara bush turns back her cuff or 
presses her wrist she may be thinking of the us forces her 
husband has sent to the persian gulf 
thats because she wears a constant reminder a nickelplated 
copper bracelet inscribed with the words operation desert shield 
a call to freedom 
mrs bush said she likes the bracelet because it brings her 
thoughts frequently back to the troops that she and president bush 
visited in saudi arabia at thanksgiving its important she 
said 
she never takes it off her press secretary anna perez 
said saturday 
reminiscent of the bracelets worn by americans for years in 
remembrance of those us soldiers imprisoned or missing in action 
from the vietnam war the bracelets are being sold by a mclean 
va couple through their nonprofit foundation part of proceeds 
help fund a phone message line for us troops stationed in the 
persian gulf 
business has boomed since the first lady showed off her bracelet 
to reporters who traveled with the bushes on their persian gulf 
trip said fred wyatt wyatt and his wife barbara founded the group 
voices for freedom that distributes the bracelets 
mrs bush told reporters that she would wear the bracelet until 
the troops are home from the gulf more than 250000 us military 
personnel have been dispatched to stand up to iraqs president 
saddam hussein and the number will soon swell to more than 
400000 
wyatt said saturday that phone and mail requests for the 
bracelets at 995 each have increased about threefold since mrs 
bush gave them a public boost 
it was more than a shot in the arm wyatt said in a 
telephone interview 
he said the group has sold nearly 10000 since it got under way 
in october 
mrs bush heard about the bracelets first from her daughter 
dorothy bush leblond who worked with mrs wyatt on a national 
rehabilitation hospital volunteer ceremony 
ms leblond gave one to her mother and father and mrs bush 
liked it so much she ordered a pair for her son marvin bush and his 
wife margaret said perez 
the proceeds from the bracelets which can be ordered by calling 
an 800 telephone number also support a message hotline for us 
troops who are unable to reach friends and relatives when they call 
home 
if a soldier gets a busy signal or no answer when calling home 
he or she can call the voices for freedom message center and record 
a message which the phone bank then will relay by calling the 
family at a time when there is someone home 
the wyatts foundation contracts with a commercial phone service 
in tysons corner va to handle the 24hour message line wyatt 
said 
of the 995 price for the bracelet 370 goes to the message 
center each bracelet costs voices for freedom 277 and 70 cents 
is for packaging and postage the leftover funds are repaying a 
30000 loan the wyatts took out to launch the project

chancellor helmut kohls government said 
saturday it was investigating whether lothar de maiziere east 
germanys last leader and now a member of kohls cabinet worked 
for the dreaded secret police or stasi 
de maziere denied the allegation 
government spokesman dieter vogel said the decision to 
investigate was made after a reference to a document was found on 
a file card under the cover name czerny with an address 
listing in former east berlin that is identical to de maizieres 
the index card was discovered among documents of the stasi said 
vogel 
earlier saturday the news magazine der spiegel said it had 
uncovered records indicating de maiziere had been an unofficial 
worker for the east german secret police using the cover name 
czerny 
vogel did not comment on the cards authenticity or give further 
details about it 
there is concern that files compiled by the stasi secret police 
could contain doctoredup papers that would incriminate innocent 
people 
vogel said that in agreement with de maiziere the stasi 
files would be examined to try to clear up the matter de maiziere 
issued a statement denying he had worked for the stasi 
de maizieres troubles reflect one of the greatest problems 
facing united germany how to deal with former east germanys stasi 
legacy and with scandals that could arise during the years to come 
the stasi files are kept under lock and in key in former east 
germany with public access strictly forbidden they consist of 
documents compiled by the stasi secret service on millions of 
people during four decades of communist rule 
the files are considered potentially explosive because of the 
information they contain on the private lives of east germans and 
because they likely reveal who worked as informers for the secret 
police 
allegations that de maiziere had been a stasi informer have 
surfaced at least twice before 
de maiziere who became east germanys first and only 
democratically elected prime minister on march 18 pointed out 
saturday that east germanys parliament had examined his background 
and exonerated him before that nations dissolution and merger with 
west germany on oct 3 
he said prior to east germanys revolution last fall when he 
was an attorney his sole contacts with the stasi were only those 
necessary for carrying out his legal work 
de maiziere added that he has asked germanys interior minister 
wolfgang schaeuble to carry out a comprehensive examination to 
show that he is innocent 
der spiegel said it has uncovered evidence that appear to show 
de maiziere began working for the stasi in 1981 it said one 
document identifies de maiziere as being the stasi worker 
codenamed czerny 
the magazine said a former stasi major named edgar hasse was 
czernys control officer the magazine said hasse wrote a 
document saying he met with czerny 10 or 12 times each 
year 
stasi files indicate the secret police were interested in de 
maiziere because he had contacts with activists in east german 
church circles and with west german government officials said der 
spiegel 
der spiegel provided excerpts of its report to other news 
organizations in advance of mondays publication

the republics independence according to news reports 
in lithuania meanwhile party officials who broke with the 
kremlin last year opened a congress at which they were expected to 
drop the word communist and rename themselves the democratic 
labor party 
the georgian communists announced they were withdrawing from the 
soviet party at a party congress in tbilisi the republics 
capital they adopted new party rules and elected avtandil 
marguiania a 45yearold engineer as party leader the official 
tass news agency said 
he replaces givi gumbaridze who resigned as first secretary of 
the party 
the new rules say the party will work with the georgian 
parliament to make the republic a sovereign state according to 
tass

become an independent political party within the framework of the 
constitution of the georgian republic

autonomous regions in the republic that oppose independence 
rejected the new party rules and decided to split from the georgian

platform calling for independence private ownership of land and a 
capitalist economy during campaigning the communist party also 
took a proindependence stance

congress one year ago with one side remaining loyal to the kremlin 
and the other being reorganized along social democratic lines 
brazauskas told the 550 delegates that although the party had 
split it was important for the emerging groups to maintain 
relations tass reported 
he also proposed that lithuania sign a treaty of economic and 
political cooperation with the soviet government for a period of 
three years that would define their relationship as sovereign 
states tass said 
elsewhere in vilnius thousands of antiindependence 
demonstrators rallied and denounced lithuanias leaders according

kasparas one of the demonstrators

palestinians in the occupied territories began 
a twoday general strike saturday to commemorate the temple mount 
slayings and the third anniversary of the palestinian uprising 
large sectors of the occupied west bank including such 
principal cities as nablus and hebron and most of the gaza strip 
remained under armyimposed curfews under which the estimated 
735000 palestinians in the area were confined to their homes

a salvadoran judge on saturday 
ordered eight soldiers to stand trial for the murder of six jesuit 
priests their housekeeper and her daughter 
court spokesman mario gonzalez said judge ricardo zamora ruled 
that col guillermo benavides three lieutenants and four soldiers 
will be tried on eight counts of murder as well as charges of 
terrorism 
he said zamora dropped burglary charges 
zamora closed his investigation on friday a step that judiciary 
sources say diminishes the chances of anyone else being implicated 
in the massacre 
the society of jesus the local roman catholic church leadership 
and members of the us congress who have been monitoring the 
investigation contend that benavides is not the only ranking 
officer behind the killings 
congressman joe moakley dmass has accused members of the 
salvadoran army high command of obstructing the investigation 
covering up evidence and lying in testimony before zamora 
zamora spent more than a year investigating and court sources 
said it is unlikely but not impossible that anyone else will be 
charged 
several defendants testified that a 40man unit raided the 
priests residence on the campus of the university of central 
america before dawn on nov 16 1989 the soldiers murdered the six 
priestprofessors as well as their housekeeper and her 15yearold 
daughter according to testimony 
two of the lieutenants accused in the case have testified that 
benavides ordered the murders and the elimination of any witnesses 
benavides denies the charges 
el salvadors radical right wing including many army officers 
had long considered the jesuits allies of leftist guerrillas waging 
an 11yearold war against a succession of usbacked governments 
the priests maintained the civil war stemmed from injustice 
official repression and widespread misery rather than international 
communist expansion this viewpoint as well as their support for a 
negotiated settlement to the conflict earned them the virulent 
enmity of rightists 
both the prosecution and the defense have the right to appeal 
zamoras ruling that the investigation is complete and his decision 
to bring the case to trial 
sources say the defense is expected to appeal a process that is 
expected to take about three months 
if the case goes to trial a fiveperson jury will review 
transcripts of testimony the judge gathered in his investigation 
and return a verdict 
juries in el salvador do not hear testimony directly from 
witnesses and their reviews generally last only a few days the 
judge imposes sentence 
murder is punishable by a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison 
and terrorism by up to 10 years in prison 
no salvadoran officer has ever been convicted of a human rights 
crime

a few days after a runway crash that killed 
eight people northwest airlines officials and industry observers 
bemoaned what they called a bad luck streak for a carrier with an 
otherwise good safety record 
northwest earned the nickname northworst during a 19871988 
epidemic of lost baggage and late flights at the nations 
fourthlargest airline 
and mondays crash on a foggy runway in detroit came just three 
years after 156 people died when a northwest md80 crashed after 
taking off from the same airport 
the two were the only fatal accidents in 27 years at the 
eaganbased carrier said christy clapp northwest spokeswoman 
aside from the crashes the airline has had a spate of 
performance and labor problems including the conviction of three 
pilots for flying while intoxicated 
i think theyve had an awful lot of problems but i think you 
would be hard pressed to find a carrier without them right now 
mike hamilton a minneapolisbased airline analyst said i dont 
think their plagues have been any worse than any of the other major 
airlines 
ivar siqveland a partner at bloomingtonbased travel 
professionals said its been months since hes heard a negative 
comment about northwest from agents in his companys seven travel 
offices 
clapp said northwest officials had expected a downturn in 
reservations following mondays crash but reservation rates were 
normal throughout the week 
travel agents were overwhelmed with customer complaints in late 
1987 and early 1988 when former republic airlines employees were 
stewing over pay disparities that lingered from northwests 1986 
takeover of republic 
the labor strife coincided with performance problems that peaked 
in january 1988 when a whopping 40 percent of northwest flights 
were late in december 1987 nearly 12 of every 1000 passengers 
filed baggage loss complaints 
boy what an ugly time clapp said 
siqveland said there has been noticeable improvement in service 
and employee morale at northwest since los angeles investor al 
checchi led a 365 billion buyout in august 1989 checchi took 
over just after the airline made peace with its unions and made 
service a top priority 
in the latest us transportation department rankings northwest 
was third among 12 us carriers tracked by the agency for ontime 
performance northwest flights were on time 855 percent of the 
time and it had fewer than two baggage complaints for every 1000 
customers 
theyve had some bad deals lately theres no doubt about 
it siqveland said but i think the feeling still is that they 
are doing a good job 
the latest spate of problems began dec 28 1989 when northwest 
publicized a bomb threat it received for a dec 30 flight from 
paris to detroit more than 100 people canceled their reservations 
28 passengers and 14 crew made the trip 
on jan 4 an engine fell off a threeengine northwest plane 
flying from miami to minneapolis the plane landed safely in tampa 
fla regulators blamed improper maintenance and proposed a 200000 
fine 
on march 8 three northwest pilots were arrested after safely 
landing a boeing 727 in the twin cities on a flight from fargo 
nd a tipster had complained that they were drinking heavily the 
night before the three were fired stripped of their licenses and 
became the first commercial pilots convicted for flying a jetliner 
while intoxicated their sentences ranged from one year to 16 
months 
in october the company reported that ground workers in atlanta 
accidentally filled the hydraulic systems of two dc9 jets with a 
mixture of hand soap and hydraulic fluid fifty flights were 
canceled and 12 planes were grounded for inspections 
on nov 17 a newspaper reported that the federal aviation 
administration ordered northwest to examine 11 of its airbus a320 
planes for possible safety defects 
the faa warned that an instrument critical to controlling the 
plane has jammed at least six times on a320s operated by foreign 
carriers and in test flights 
most recently an auxiliary generator on a northwest plane 
ignited wednesday as the plane landed in detroit the fire was 
extinguished and there were no injuries and that same dat a new 
yorkbound northwest plane made an emergency landing at newark 
nj airport after running low on fuel 
for the past several months the spotlight or the microscope 
has been on northwest clapp said we dont think that we have 
had any more severe or any more numbers of problems than any other 
large airline 
professor arnold barnett a statistician at massachusetts 
institute of technology who studies air travel said northwest has 
an excellent safety record despite its wellpublicized problems 
the correlation between the kind of press you get and the 
overall level of safety may be a very weak correlation barnett 
said 
northwest had gone decades without any accidents its 
aggregate safety record is absolutely excellent barnett said 
the only fatal accidents are the two that are right on your mind 
now

when the environmental protection agency was 
formed on dec 2 1970 phenomena like acid raid global warming 
and ozone depletion meant nothing to most americans 
today theyre a familiar and grim lexicon of the kind of 
environmental problems the agency was established to address 
the environment then was a different kind of issue than it is 
today said william ruckelshaus the first epa administrator now 
the chief executive officer of browning ferris industries 
since 1970 the agency which originally faced slowbuilding 
problems like smog and dirty rivers has had to deal with a host of 
environmental catastrophes like the exxon valdez oil spill in 
alaskas prince william sound 
ruckelshaus said his vision of the agencys ability to clean 
pollution changed quickly once he realized how expensive it could 
be 
i wasnt there very long before i realized this was a much 
more complicated problem than i had originally thought he said 
other notable environmental disasters the agency faced were the 
1979 accident at the three mile island nuclear plant in 
pennsylvania and industrial chemical contamination of the love 
canal area of niagara falls ny 
one of ruckelshaus early decisions was to phase out domestic 
use of ddt a pesticide rachel carson warned about in her 1962 book 
silent spring which was found to work its way through the food 
chain posing a threat to humans 
also under ruckelshaus the agency reauthorized the federal 
water pollution control act and strengthened the clean air act 
which forced automobile manufcturers to meet certain emissions 
standards 
ruckelshaus left the agency in 1973 and returned a decade later 
after the scandal involving former epa head anne burford who was 
cited for contempt of congress in 1982 for refusing to turn over 
agency records 
the 20 years of the epa have seen public awareness and concern 
about the environment increase dramatically 
earth day 1970 was a major milestone in awakening american 
consciousness and its been on the rise ever since said michael 
deland chairman of the presidents council on environmental 
quality in washington 
environmentalists give the epa mixed reviews 
ralph nader the consumer advocate and environmental activist 
said the epa hasnt performed up to its potential but has made some 
progress in cleaning up water pollution and in reducing lead in the 
environment 
by and large it has good equipment but it hasnt used it 
because its been straitjacketed nader said it has a good 
deal of authority to do things but its been corporatized by a 
corporateendentured government 
barry commoner social activist and author of the new book 
making peace with the planet was more critical 
if the criterion is the improvement of the environment they 
get low marks because the improvement has been very 
disappointing commoner said 
deland said the epas next step should be to find ways to 
dispose of waste permanently 
epa was in the business of moving pollution around from one 
medium to another he said

the japanese television 
company that paid 12 million to send a reporter on a soviet space 
mission will think long and hard before another venture with the 
soviets a company official says 
my advice dont do business with the soviets for 10 years 
said ichiro sasaki an executive producer at the tokyo broadcasting 
system 
it was sasakis idea to send journalist toyohiro akiyama into 
space and he helped organize the project 
now even before the mission ends he is disillusioned 
their space development is advanced but their business is 
not he said in an interview last week 
the soviets have been trying for two years to commercialize 
their space program the space agency glavkosmos has signed 
commercial agreements for space flights with austria britain 
germany and france and more are in the works with china iran and 
spain 
sasaki said the soviet space industry itself is dependable and 
even could be profitable for foreign investors 
but he complained about a disorganized array of companies and 
agencies that often make conflicting demands 
for example the companys initial contract with space agency 
glavkosmos for example said akiyama would cooperate on the 
eightday mission with the two soviet cosmonauts flight commander 
victor afanasyev and engineer musa manarov 
the japanese company understood its initial payment would cover 
the estimated 12 hours of help from the cosmonauts sasaki said 
but in the weeks leading up to liftoff officials of energia 
the company that builds rockets and negotiates on behalf of the 
cosmonauts said tbs must pay an additional 100000 per hour for 
the services of manarov and afanasyev while in orbit sasaki said 
the help could be anything from holding a camera for akiyamas 
live broadcasts to feeding his experimental japanese tree frogs 
a highlevel soviet government committee sided with the 
japanese but energia was still insisting on payment sasaki said 
the two sides agreed that five hours of cooperation would be 
covered under the contract and cost of the remaining time would be 
figured later but whether or not the company will eventually be 
billed for more isnt settled 
were not intending to pay anything sasaki said 
despite the dispute sasaki said his company was less upset by 
the extra charges than by the surprises and conflicts that arose 
after the contract was signed more than a year ago 
this is their space officials first attempt at business with 
a foreigner but theyre still using a soviet way of business 
sasaki said 
the mission is to end monday

the united states on saturday evacuated 
about 400 former libyan prisoners of war from chad in what it 
called an international humanitarian effort libya called the move 
piracy 
ambassador richard bogosian refused to comment on allegations 
the pows had been trained by the united states for commando 
operations to destabilize the regime of libyas col moammar 
gadhafi 
the evacuation the second in two days incured the wrath of 
libya which called it an international act of piracy and 
demanded an emergency meeting of the un security council 
bogosian confirmed that about 200 former pows had been evacuated 
on friday in addition to the 400 who were airlifted out on 
saturday 
chads interim president idriss deby said the decision to 
evacuate libyans wanting to leave was made in all sovereignty 
deby toppled prowestern president hissene habre a week ago 
after his guerrillas armed in part by libya overcame the 
government forces in a threeweek offensive 
the french news agency agence francepresse whose 
correspondent witnessed fridays evacuation quoted an american 
military source as saying the libyans were being flown to nigeria 
then a third country 
the ambassador refused to specify the libyans destination 
saying details were not finalized 
he said he did not believe there would be further evacuations 
when the new government came in last week they in effect 
allowed these people to leave if they wished bogosian said in a 
telephone interview 
he referred to the departing libyans as refugees saying they 
had been disarmed he would not elaborate 
chad captured about 2000 libyan soldiers in fighting in 1983 
and the spring of 1987 by the summer of 1987 about 700 of them 
agreed to help maintain captured libyan weaponry they gradually 
were turned over to american military advisers for tutoring in 
commando and terrorist operations against libya afp reported 
quoting an american military source 
debys decision to allow captured libyans to go was part of a 
reconciliation effort with libya chads northern neighbor with 
which this poor and landlocked nation has had differences for 25 
years 
we inherited this situation deby told a news conference 
we dont want to have problems with our neighbors weve 
given these people a choice either put down their arms and demand 
refugee status and they would be welcome or leave 
the libyan foreign ministry charged in a communique that the 
united states seized the 200 libyan pows in chad against their 
will it called the move an international act of piracy 
equivalent to statesponsored terrorism 
libya demands an emergency session of the un security 
council to discuss the piracy act pursued by the us 
libyas official jana news agency claimed that 17 exprisoners 
of war were executed for refusing to obey americas orders to 
leave chad 
jana monitored in rome said that libyan foreign minister 
ibrahim muhammed albishari left tripoli saturday for lagos 
nigeria in an effort to get the libyan hostages back 
us embassy spokesman mark krischik described the evacuation as 
a humanitarian gesture with international backing but refused to 
elaborate on involvement by other countries 
we provided the transportation thats essentially what we 
did said the us ambassador he said chads new government had 
been consulted and the red cross was present and had an 
opportunity to find out if any of these people didnt want to go 
some former libyan pows opted to return to their homeland a few 
asked to remain in chad and the rest wanted to leave bogosian 
said 
libyas ambassador to france saad mujber said about 450 
libyans had taken refuge at the libyan embassy in ndjamena he 
denied that those who left were part of an opposition force

zulu leader mangosuthu 
buthelezi on saturday called the countrys continuing violence the 
heritage of armed struggle waged against the whiteled 
government by rival opposition groups 
nine people died in scattered violence in the previous 24 hours 
police said including a policeman shot to death while chasing 
suspected car thieves in the black township of soweto 
the chronic unrest mostly clashes between black factions has 
killed about 1000 people in black townships near johannesburg 
since it broke out aug 12 
it spread to the johannesburg area from eastern natal province 
where more than 5000 people have died in five years of virtual 
warfare between supporters of buthelezis zulubased inkatha 
freedom party and the african national congress 
inkatha has traditionally been more conservative than the anc 
and other opposition groups it opposed the ancs armed struggle 
which was suspended in august as a concession to peace talks with 
the whiteled government 
the anc and other groups said the armed struggle protests and 
other forms of mass action were the only political weapons blacks 
had under the apartheid system of racial segregation and white 
dominance 
winnie mandela wife of anc leader nelson mandela told a rally 
saturday the anc would resume its armed struggle if pushed too far 
by the government black leaders have accused security forces of 
using excessive force against black demonstrators 
if the government continues to shoot our people well shoot 
back she told about 3000 people in the black township of 
alexandra 
in a speech to about 6000 delegates at an inkatha party 
congress buthelezi said the armed struggle created an environment 
of violence for blacks 
the killings now taking place in south africa were a heritage 
of parties which declared an armed struggle called for a 
peoples war and called for the country to be made ungovernable 
he said 
inkatha will work for a multiparty democracy in south africa to 
prevent any single group black or white from gaining dictatorial 
control buthelezi said 
inkatha and the anc both oppose apartheid the system of racial 
separation but differ on the leadership and policies of a future 
south africa inkatha favors a freemarket economy and promotes 
tribalism while the anc advocates more leftist and pantribal 
policies 
both buthelezi and mandela have called for peace in the 
townships but their supporters have continued skirmishing 
buthelezi has repeatedly called for a oneonone meeting with 
mandela saying they are the only two leaders with the power to end 
the fighting 
the anc has refused to meet with buthelezi contending he 
instigated the violence to broaden his power base from natal the 
traditional zulu homeland the inkatha congress on saturday 
reaffirmed buthelezi as the partys leader 
president fw de klerk has promised to end apartheid and 
negotiate powersharing with the black majority the government and 
anc have held talks since may aimed at setting up formal 
negotiations on a new constitution 
a police unrest report for the previous 24 hours provided few 
details of incidents near johannesburg cape town and in natal that 
killed nine people 
it said three bodies were found in the bekkersdal township 
southwest of johannesburg raising to eight the number of people 
killed there since wednesday there was no indication of who killed 
the victims 
police shot one man to death and wounded another when fired on 
by a group of people in natal the report said 
another man was shot to death by an unidentified gunman in 
natal and a stabbed and shot body was found near cape town the 
police report said no details of the killings were provided 
two hacked and stabbed bodies were found in the daveyton 
township east of johannesburg the report said 
police capt ruben bloomberg told the independent south african 
press association that officers stopped a suspected stolen car in 
soweto early saturday and gave chase when the occupants fled one 
constable was shot in the chest and died bloomberg said

a coalition of groups representing minorities 
called saturday for the ouster of justice minister seiroku 
kajiyama who came under fire earlier this year for a remark that 
offended many blacks in japan and abroad 
the groups also called for measures to fight discrimination 
the coalition comprised of groups with a total membership of 
more than 200000 called for the justice ministers dismissal as 
supporters demonstrated in downtown tokyo 
kajiyama came under criticism in september after likening 
american blacks to prostitutes who he said were spoiling a tokyo 
neighborhood its like in america when neighborhoods become 
mixed because blacks move in and whites are forced out he said 
then 
several groups in japan that called for kajiyamas ouster 
decided they would be more effective if they worked together on 
that and other issues said jr dash president of the japan 
afroamerican friendship association 
the coalition includes minority koreans the indigenous ainu 
group the lowerclass japanese known as village people 
africans and americans 
the coalition said it is calling for educational programs in 
japan to correct the pervasive stereotypes of some japanese 
people regarding the history and achievements of africans and all 
peoples of african descent 
it is asking for laws to protect women and for the dismantling 
of legal and social structures that discriminate against minorities 
in japan 
the coalition also is protesting the import of women mostly 
from southeast asia to serve in japans thriving sex trade 
about 30 members of the coalition camped saturday night under a 
patch of trees in a small park in glittery ginza one of tokyos 
main shopping districts 
police had not granted a permit for the demonstration but 
generally appeared to be leaving the group alone said gretchen 
cook a columbia md woman who is researching japanese perceptions 
of blacks 
most of the thousands of holiday shoppers streaming through the 
area seemed unaware of the demonstration even when a japanese 
parliamentarian stood with protesters 
through activities like this we can raise the consciousness 
of people in japan that other people are human too said ikuo 
aoki a central executive committee member of the buraku liberation 
league a coalition of village people groups 
the village people or burakumin in japanese are japans 
largest minority group and are estimated to number about 3 million 
physically indistinguishable from other japanese they were 
associated in the past with unclean jobs such as leather 
working and undertaking and continue to suffer discrimination 
koreans the largest foreign minority are treated as aliens 
although many were born and raised in japan most came or are 
descended from people who were brought to japan during the 35 years 
that korea was a japanese colony

voting was light and some polling stations 
were even empty saturday in nigerias first elections in more than 
a decade a prelude to the militarys carefully orchestrated plans 
to return civilian rule by 1992 
the small turnout was blamed on lack of interest in the two 
governmentcreated parties in the local council races other 
nigerians feared violence under a controversial voting procedure 
that did not allow secret ballots 
excessive security could also have kept voters away about 
80000 police were deployed around the large west african nation 
and soldiers manned roadblocks to stop people from leaving their 
neighborhoods all vehicles except those of government officers on 
essential business were barred from the streets 
a total of 12056 candidates were running for 5572 councilors 
seats and 453 council chairmanships 
balloting ended peacefully in lagos capital of this powerful 
oilrich country with africas biggest population of more than 100 
million people 
voters were required to line up behind the candidate or a 
poster of the candidate to register their vote they were counted 
at noon 
many nigerians complained that lining up left them open to 
intimidation and cast doubt on the fairness of the elections 
about 42000 polling stations were designed to each accommodate 
200 to 500 voters 
but some polling booths attracted no voters at all at one 
station in the lagos suburb of pedro only 21 of the 499 registered 
voters turned out 
results were expected sunday 
last month the government banned political rallies in lagos 
because of violent intraparty rivalries 
nigerias president gen ibrahim babangida had said any 
disruption in saturdays voting could force his government to delay 
handing over civil rule on oct 1 1992 
electoral commission spokesman tonnie iredia said the very 
peaceful polling seems to have vindicated our resolve to adopt the 
open ballot system 
most election candidates were private businessmen and 
middlelevel executives with university degrees 
the military banned established politicians from contesting 
saying they were tainted by corruption that caused two previous 
civilian governments to fall 
the last elections in 1979 brought in civilian president shehu 
shagari he was overthrown in 1983 by maj gen muhammadu buhari 
who in turn was ousted by babangida on aug 27 1985 
babangida is the sixth military ruler since nigerias 
independence from britain in 1960 he has survived three coup 
attempts and narrowly escaped death on april 22 when mutinous 
soldiers shelled his barracks residence 
the general astonished the nation last year by banning 13 
independent groups wishing to contest the 1992 elections instead 
the government created the rightleaning national republican 
convention and leftofcenter social democratic party 
babangida said the banned organizations were organized on tribal 
and religious lines leaders of the april coup sought to end 
political domination by moslem northerners 
critics say the governmentsanctioned parties reproduced 
longstanding differences with republicans attracting mainly moslem 
northerners and christians and followers of traditional religions 
in the oilrich south joining the social democrats

the church where a shimmering image has 
appeared that some believe represents the virgin mary had its 
hanging light fixtures repaired a day before the image first 
appeared officials said 
the image which appears for about one hour each day has 
attracted thousands of visitors to st dominics church 
the newly disclosed information about the light fixtures 
supports a theory put forward thursday by physics professor james 
phelps that the image is a natural reflection of sunlight bouncing 
off a light fixture onto the wall phelps is an optics expert from 
california state university at sacramento 
it might explain it said parishioner edmund mick 
molloy whose father ed is the church administrator 
but the explanation failed to keep more than 2000 people from 
crowding into the church again saturday 
the crowds were peaceful as they have been every day and 
brought welcome business to local restaurants and filling stations 
i hope it goes on for a long time said teri simons who 
owns a coffee shop near the church in the town of 1000 situated 
45 miles northeast of sacramento 
parishioner freda hoffman who answered the telephone at the 
church saturday refused to discuss explanations 
i honestly cant tell you at all about it because theyre 
trying to make it a hoax she said we believe it is the virgin 
mary we believe in it because we are catholics 
the curved image in soft shades of blue green and pink appeared 
again saturday on the wall over the shoulder of a statue of jesus 
as it has every day since thanksgiving 
molloy said that one of the fixtures fell to the church floor 
apparently vibrated loose by overhead heating ducts 
i dont know if the one that came zinging down was the one 
closest to the vision molloy said but i do know all of them 
were fixed up the same way they put wire around the outside of the 
glass covers and other pieces of metal various and sundry stuff 
molloy said the work was done the day before thanksgiving 
bishop francis quinn of sacramento said friday he welcomed 
phelps theory but had no plans to test it 
actually i dont think we will have any kind of official 
commission until after christmas if it is needed at all quinn 
said it is not customary for the church in the first fervor to 
come to a quick resolution 
quinn said he does not like to interrupt the genuine fervor of 
the people people are the church as well as bishops and clergy 
and religious sisters

iraq has rejected the usproposed dates 
for secretary of state james a baker iiis trip to baghdad for 
talks with saddam hussein the official iraqi news agency said 
saturday 
the state department suggested dec 20 dec 21 dec 22 or jan 
3 for the baker trip iraq proposed jan 12 the news agency said 
a jan 12 date would come only three days before the deadline 
set down in a un resolution demanding an iraqi withdrawal from 
kuwait the security council measure authorizes use of all 
necessary means to dislodge iraq after that 
the state department has not disclosed any proposed dates for 
the trip to washington by iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz the 
iraqi news agency said baghdad had proposed dec 17 
the foreign ministry said it had informed the american charge 
daffaires in baghdad joseph wilson of its proposal 
in washington an official said the dates for the visits were 
still under discussion with iraq the official said wilson had 
discussed some possibilities with iraqi foreign ministry officials 
on saturday 
the meetings were proposed by president bush in a surprise 
diplomatic initiative last week 
national security adviser brent scowcroft said he believes 
saddam prefers the talks to occur as close as possible to the jan 
15 un deadline 
this is just another ploy that hes trying to use to drag 
things out and to avoid serious seriously facing up to what the 
world community is demanding that he do scowcroft said in an 
interview on cnn 
the iraqi news agency said it learned that the american side 
proposed other dates for the two meetings that were found not 
suitable for the iraqi side it did not say what dates had been 
proposed by the united states for the aziz visit 
the foreign ministery declared its real desire for dialogue 
and exchange of opinion in a comprehensive serious and thorough 
manner said the news agency monitored in nicosia cyprus 
the ministry added that concern must be centered on seeking 
understanding as an alternative for the language of threat the 
report said 
it said the foreign ministry repeated iraqs position that an 
overall approach to middle east problems was needed particularly 
the arabisraeli conflict 
bush has insisted that there be no linkage of the gulf crisis 
and other middle east issues bush has said he would tell aziz 
and baker would tell saddam that iraq must leave kuwait without 
conditions 
the iraqi news agency quoted the iraqi ministry as saying iraq 
would emphasize its national rights including its rights in 
kuwait 
iraq declared kuwait its 19th province after it annexed the 
emirate it invaded on aug 2 
iraqi authorities announced in a saturday broadcast the public 
should renew vigilance for the possible threat from the 
multinational force in the gulf 
posters warning the population not to panic in case of attack 
appeared on walls of buildings in downtown baghdad 
the news agency reported that saddam presided over a meeting of 
the general command of the armed forces on saturday 
it said the meeting was attended by defense minister gen 
abduljabbar shanshal and hussein kamel minister of industry and 
military industrialization but it gave no other details

a judge barred aids and abortion rights 
activists from disrupting services at st patricks cathedral on 
the anniversary of a protest that led to 43 arrests inside the 
church last year 
at the new york archdioceses request state supreme court judge 
harold baer jr issued the temporary restraining order friday 
against the aids coalition to unleash power and the womens health 
action mobilization 
the judges order permits the activists to enter the church 
sunday but prohibits them from yelling screaming lying between 
the aisles throwing objects handcuffing themselves to pews or 
other fixtures or throwing dropping or spitting on the communion 
wafer 
the activists contend that cardinal john j oconnor and the 
archdiocese are obstructing the dissemination of information about 
safe sex and are advocating hatred and violence against 
homosexuals and abortion rights supporters 
illegal meddling in public health policies is resulting in 
spreading aids and killing thousands of people the groups said 
in a joint statement 
shraga lev a spokeswoman for the activists said the judges 
order would not affect plans for demonstrations outside the church 
the groups had planned forms of disobedience religious 
dissension and personal prayers of protest during the 1015 am 
mass 
during the dec 10 1989 demonstration protesters disrupted 
oconnors homily by chanting lying down in the aisles and 
chaining themselves to pews 
some 4500 protesters clogged fifth avenue and rockefeller 
center already thronged with holiday crowds 
fortythree people were arrested inside the church and nearly 70 
outside in what a church spokesman said was believed to be the 
largest protest ever staged at the cathedral six were convicted of 
criminal trespass disorderly conduct resisting arrest and other 
offenses they will be sentenced in january 
lori cohen a lawyer for the activists said last years protest 
was a form of worship and that her clients have a right to 
worship in their own manner 
monsignor anthony della villa st patricks rector recalled 
that during last years protest the demonstrators called oconnor 
a murderer tossed condoms around the cathedral at other 
worshipers 
they threw or spat consecrated communion wafers to the floor 
of the cathedral it would be difficult to imagine a more 
offensive act than the desecration of the sacred host he said

portauprince haiti ap haitians have been shaken by an 
attack at a campaign rally that killed seven people but officials 
say the violence will not derail attempts to hold the nations 
first free presidential vote 
the three key elements in the process the electoral council 
the army and the people are determined to go ahead and make a 
success of these elections said ismael diallo of burkina faso 
spokesman for the un election verification mission the sentiment 
has been echoed by the candidates and election officials 
more than 400 international observers including former 
president jimmy carter have agreed to monitor the balloting on 
dec 16 
nevertheless wednesdays attack in which assailants i a jeep 
hurled a grenade and sprayed bullets on thousands of supporters of 
the leftist rev jeanbertrand aristide has caused outrage and 
heightened fears of further election violence 
in addition to the seven killed more than 50 were wounded 
including a 14yearold girl who had her legs and a hand amputated 
haitis last attempt to hold free and fair elections on nov 
29 1987 dissolved in a bloodbath thugs shot and hacked to death 
at least 34 people at polling stations and in the streets 
elections in january 1988 were controlled by the army 
this impoverished caribbean nation of 6 million people has been 
ruled by tyrants virtually since independence from france in 1804 
the fall of dictator jeanclaude duvalier in february 1986 opened 
the way for democracy but instead there have been five different 
governments four of them run or controlled by the army 
the latest military ruler lt gen prosper avril fled into 
exile in march after widespread demonstrations and supreme court 
judge ertha pascaltrouillot was appointed provisional president to 
lead the country to democratic elections 
the government set up a military commission to investigate last 
weeks attack banned street demonstrations and closed schools 
early for the christmas holidays 
but the danger some haitians fear is that the notoriously 
illdisciplined and corrupt army will fail to pursue the 
perpetrators of the violence provoking street protests while 
emboldening the terrorists to make further attempts to scare voters 
away from the polls 
unless the army takes immediate measures to bring these guys 
in you cant stop the people from taking to the streets said 
jeanclaude roy a centerleft politician 
if these macoutes are not arrested theyll think they have a 
free hand and do worse again he said referring to remnants of 
the outlawed tonton macoute militia that enforced the 29year 
dictatorship of francois papa doc duvalier and son jeanclaude 
known as baby doc 
aristide accused dr roger lafontant a reputed former head of 
the tonton macoute of masterminding the attack lafontant who 
returned from exile in the neighboring dominican republic to 
contest the election but was disqualified on a technicality denied 
the charge 
the bloodshed was not wholly unexpected because of the priests 
strident opposition to haitis previous repressive regimes but it 
shattered a calm that had prevailed throughout the election 
campaign 
in contrast to 1987 when hundreds died over several months in a 
terror campaign orchstrated by hardline duvalierists not one 
electionrelated death had been recorded since voter registration 
opened in october 
among the 11 presidential candidates the charismatic aristide 
37 is widely regarded as the frontrunner 
expelled from his ecclesiastical order in 1988 for allegedly 
fomenting revolution aristide has a huge following among the urban 
poor but rural support for his national front for change and 
democracy may not be as great 
an opinion poll carried out in late november by independent 
radio metropole and a local polling firm indicated aristide would 
get 58 percent of the vote enough to get elected without a 
runoff his nearest competitor former world bank official marc 
bazin 58 was favored by 13 percent 
the other four leading contenders evangelical preacher sylvio 
claude 56 agronomist louis dejoie jr 62 industrialist thomas 
desulme 77 and sociologist hubert de roncerary 58 each had 
from 3 to 5 percent of the sample 
the poll was carried out among 1170 residents of the 
portauprince area thought to be an aristide stronghold its 
statistical margin o error was not stated 
if no candidate wins a majority of the vote a runoff will be 
held in january the president is to be inaugurated feb 7 the 
fifth anniversary of duvaliers fall 
haitians also are electing 110 members of the bicameral national 
assembly 134 mayors 268 municipal council members and 1695 
county officials

a 3yearold boy who was starved beaten and left 
to die on a bed of leaves was killed by every person in this 
state a juvenile court judge said in an emotional rebuke of the 
childwelfare system 
judge william gladstone called state officials into court friday 
to castigate them about the death of lazaro figueroa who had been 
under state supervision for two years the judge also took personal 
blame for the death 
the boys mother ana marie cardona 29 and her roommate 
olivia gonzalezmendoza 24 were charged last week with 
firstdegree murder and aggravated child abuse and were being held 
without bond 
the dead boys sister taimy cardona 5 and a brother juan 
puente 10 have been taken into state custody 
the case drew widespread attention because the boys body was 
left in front of a home in a wealthy miami beach neighborhood and 
went unidentified for a month a baby sitter finally tipped off 
police 
a utility crew found the body nov 2 the child was 33 inches 
tall but weighed only 18 pounds his head was disfigured from 
swelling around a healed bruise on his forehead 
as weeks passed with no clues to his identity he was nicknamed 
baby lollipops because his tshirt was decorated with 
lollipops 
his mother and her roommate told police they had left him 
alive but injured four days before but an autopsy determined 
he had been dead less than a day he had brain damage from a skull 
fracture and other fresh and old injuries were found 
lazaro came under the supervision of the state department of 
health and rehabilitative services when he and his sister were 
abandoned for three months with a baby sitter the agency lost 
track of the family three months later when cardona vanished 
the women told investigators they expected someone to find the 
boy and take care of him 
in their minds someone rich would find him theyd clothe him 
and feed him said miami beach detective gary schiaffo 
this case is my failure too said the judge tears welling 
in his eyes we all failed somehow this child was killed and he 
was killed by every one of us 
gladstone was not told the family had left home because the 
caseworker didnt know she was required to tell the judge within 48 
hours of the familys disappearance said isabel 
afanadorvillalobos a senior hrs program manager 
she estimated the caseworker had a caseload of at least 50 
children compared to the national standard of 12 
the death of bradley mcgee a florida toddler killed in 1989 by 
his parents while under hrs supervision generated such an outcry 
that state lawmakers boosted childprotection spending to avoid a 
recurrence 
its amazing theres not another lazaro figueroa or 80 or 
100 more out there gladstone said if we cant learn something 
from this kind of tragedy we should just fold up the tents and go 
home

in just three days last week prosecutors of one 
of new yorks most important murder cases in recent years the 
bensonhurst racial slaying suffered a series of stunning and 
embarrassing setbacks 
with little apparent dissent two separate jury panels 
determined quickly that three young white men charged with murder 
and accused of being key players in the death of 16yearold yusuf 
hawkins were innocent of the most serious crimes 
at the end of murder trials for five of the eightdefendants 
the district attorneys office in the borough of brooklyn has won 
only one murder conviction that of triggerman joseph fama 
three of the alleged attackers were found guilty of lesser 
crimes and one defendant was completely exonerated 
victorious defense lawyers say its time to question the 
scenario of the aug 23 1989 slaying presented by prosecutors and 
the police 
in the early days of the investigation said defendant james 
patinos lawyer benjamin brafman there were tremendous 
pressures on everyone to return indictments quickly to quell the 
unrest that was upsetting the city prosecutors ran with a theory 
that was not supported by the facts 
defense lawyers all say fama acted alone when he shot hawkins 
and the other whites had assembled because they believed outsiders 
were coming to their insular bensonhurst neighborhood to cause 
trouble 
but prosecutors stand by their account of the incident 
asserting that hawkins and his three young unarmed friends were 
set upon by a mob of some 30 batwielding whites only because they 
were black 
fama emerged from the mob pointed a 32caliber automatic at 
hawkins and squeezed off four shots two of which tore through his 
heart 
hawkins slaying was the most serious racial incident in the 
city since the 1986 killing of a young black man by a gang of 
whites in howard beach 
with racial tensions near the breaking point hawkins murder 
sparked a series of massive and sometimes violent demonstrations 
and protest marches 
within days of the shooting one of the youths john vento 
agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for immunity he 
appeared before the grand jury and was expected to be a key 
prosecution witness at the trials 
hawkins family has spurned plea bargains with defendants they 
said they wanted to see trials not deals 
if they had offered my son an option if they had shot him in 
the leg i would have offered them an option said hawkins 
father moses stewart but they murdered him and there was no 
bargaining on that 
vento later dealt a major blow to prosecutors by reneging on his 
deal after his family was threatened 
after vento doublecrossed us these cases were almost 
impossible said assistant district attorney edward boyar 
the case also was difficult because jurors had trouble 
understanding how defendants could be charged with murder although 
they neither shot nor struck anyone prosecutors said 
the defendants prosecutors said were murderers because they 
shared the mental culpability of fama while acting in 
concert with him 
it was a very difficult case said assistant district 
attorney paul burns its always hard to convict someone who is 
not the triggerman 
the trial judge justice thaddeus owens of brooklyns state 
supreme court agreed 
it was the most difficult case i have ever tried the charges 
themselves and the theory under which this case was tried were 
difficult concepts that even lawyers have problems with 
but defense lawyers say their clients were cleared of murder and 
manslaughter because the district attorneys office overreached 
and over indicted 
james j dipietro whose client joseph serrano was cleared of 
murder manslaughter and other charges said the defendants were 
sacrificial lambs dipietro said he places much of the blame on 
elizabeth holtzman the former district attorney who was running 
for city comptroller when hawkins was killed 
holtzman strongly denied any political motive for the 
indictments she notes that her successor charles j hynes 
pursued the indictments and added some additional charges after he 
took office last january 
with the trials of three defendants two of whom face murder 
and manslaughter charges still ahead the prosecutions 
bensonhurst scorecard looks like this 
fama was convicted of seconddegree murder and is serving up 
to life in prison in new york firstdegree murder charges are 
brought only if the victim is a law enforcement officer 
vento was acquitted thursday of murder and manslaughter and 
found guilty of riot unlawful imprisonment and menacing crimes 
that carry a total penalty of four to 12 years 
keith mondello ringleader of the whites was acquitted of 
murder and manslaughter but was found guilty of several lesser 
crimes and is serving five and onethird years to 16 years 
serrano was convicted on a misdemeanor weapons charge and 
faces up to one year in jail 
patino 25 was completely exonerated

us servicemen took time out 
from their duties saturday to enjoy an american tradition rooting 
for their favorites in the armynavy football game 
if there was one game i had to pick the super bowl the 
orange bowl or whatever this is the game id want to see said 
lt cmdr tim traeen 36 of gig harbor wash 
it incorporates all the reasons why im in the navy the 
challenge the competition the spirit traeen said 
traeen left his duty station as supply officer aboard the uss 
blue ridge the flag ship for the us navy central command in the 
persian gulf region to watch the game live on armed forces 
network 
a former tight end at the naval academy he once recalled 
listening to the game results during strategic operations in a 
missile submarine 
also watching the game which army won 3020 was us army col 
bill mulvey a 1968 graduate of west point and now director of the 
joint information bureau in eastern saudi arabia 
in 1969 he listened to the game on the radio behind the trigger 
of a 50 caliber machine gun while doing perimeter guard duty in an 
armored personnel carrier in vietnam 
the 12th man isnt just the cadets in the stands were all 
part of the army team said mulvey 44 of clarksville tenn 
these navy guys get to watch the game in their air conditioned 
wardrooms off the coast in saudi arabia the army has to listen on 
the radio because theyre in the desert he said unable to 
resist a dig at the navy 
signs of the rivalry invaded islamic culture there were go 
navy bumper stickers arrayed against army banners that read 
swamp canoe u and navys top gun is a pop gun 
watching the game was a pleasant break from duty stations 
enforcing un sanctions against iraq or guard posts in the sand to 
deter iraqi aggression as part of operation desert shield some 
soldiers brought their rifles and gas masks to watch the game 
soldiers and sailors whooped and cheered and taunted each other 
yet both sides acknowledged that despite the sports rivalry 
they were on the same side in the gulf 
you can beat the heck out of each other on the football field 
but when the stuff hits the fan we pull together traeen said 
one bemused but neutral spectator to the game on the 100th 
anniversary of the first armynavy game was faheem hamid editor 
of the saudi gazette 
im just trying to figure out whats happening said hamid 
to tell you the truth im watching for the sake of change its 
something different this football is very aggressive but its 
full of enjoyment

nasa said saturday it may bring the 
space shuttle columbia back to earth a day early because of clogged 
lines that prevented waste water from being dumped overboard 
the clog became the latest in a string of problems for the 
10day astronomy mission which wasnt supposed to end until 
tuesday night 
columbias seven astronauts were in no danger nasa said but 
flight directors rushed to develop ways to solve the problem 
randy stone chief of nasas flight director office initially 
said it was unlikely columbia would have to return sunday adding 
that monday was more likely mission control later in the day 
assured the crew it would stay in space until monday 
i would be hopeful that we can get to 10 days but where we 
stand right now im not terribly optimistic that we can make it 
stone said but certainly we will not give up on that because we 
do want to maximize the science were getting out of this 
mission 
onboard computer failures and a faulty instrument pointing 
system already left the 150 million astro observatory aboard the 
shuttle far behind its schedule of observing stars galaxies and 
other celestial objects 
we feel now that things are going rather well said warren 
moos of the johns hopkins university telescope team we would be 
very disappointed but we also understand thats also the way the 
mission works if theres something that endangers the spacecraft 
you simply have no choice 
the waste water tanks clogged lines were discovered saturday 
morning while the crew was performing the shuttles daily water 
dump 
as columbia circled the world for the 101st time the astronauts 
purged the line with air they said they succeeded in removing some 
debris but a partial blockage remained 
astronaut mike lounge transferred some water from the 20gallon 
tank located beneath the cabin floor into a large rubber bag 
before lounge began the task the tank was about twothirds full 
and would have been full within 20 hours 
the transfer to the bag which can hold about 12 gallons should 
provide another 40 hours of flight time unless other watersaving 
measures can be carried out 
to help keep the tanks water level down mission controls 
story musgrave instructed the crew to start using the 54 urine 
collection bags on board besides urine the tank holds water from 
humidity removed from the cabin 
stone said the astronauts would not be asked to drink less 
water 
that is nonproductive from a physiological standpoint because 
you want them in the best possible shape you can get them in 
stone said 
nasa has had trouble with the shuttles waste water system in 
previous missions during columbias last flight in january water 
collected under the floor because of lint and other contamination 
sucked into the plumbing stone said in 1984 ice collected on a 
nozzle on discoverys water output lines 
lint was found to be clogging the air vents of a computer that 
failed aboard columbia on dec 2 stone declined to speculate as to 
whether lint also might have clogged the shuttles waste water 
lines 
as the national aeronautics and space administration debated 
what to do stargazing calmly continued 218 miles above earth 
astronautastronomers jeffrey hoffman and sam durrance with 
guidance from ground teams focused the observatorys three 
ultraviolet telescopes on a variety of stars 
nasa told the crew they might be able to catch a glimpse of the 
galileo spacecraft as it passed within 2160 miles of the shuttle

believes to own the necklace was offered 23500 by the national 
museum

union leaders and students agreed 
saturday to launch nationwide strikes next week to topple the 
government 
it was the latest sign of growing popular discontent threatening 
government leaders who opponents accuse of ties to the deposed 
communist regime of nicolae ceausescu 
the decision to go on with the protest monday came despite a 
government promise to postpone by six months price increases for 
basic foods that had been scheduled to take effect jan 1 
the government concession announced friday had been made in an 
effort to defuse the mounting criticism of its actions and the 
threat of strikes across the nation however union representatives 
were unimpressed 
this is a bait and we wont take it its very 
ceausesculike ion toth of the national drivers union told 
reporters 
the communist dictator who was known to sometimes ease his 
repressive rule as a strategic ploy was overthrown in the romanian 
revolution a year ago he was executed at that time 
prices of most items have doubled and tripled since the lifting 
of state price controls on nov 1 and people in several cities 
have taken to the street in mass protests recently as a result 
at the news conference at the union confederation headquarters 
daniel vasile vice president of the 100000member drivers union 
said the strike will begin monday and will end when the 
government comes down 
a statement by the union confederation said the onemillion 
member fratia union and 300000member hercules union which 
represent workers in a variety of jobs would support the drivers 
strike and its final aim 
in another strike call a national students conference in 
timisoara about 250 miles northwest of bucharest proclaimed a 
boycott of classes beginning monday and demanded the resignation of 
president ion iliescu 
in his remarks vasile also demanded the dismissal of all 
compromised former communists who are still leading local 
government and industry 
the governing national salvation front which ruled 
provisionally before overwhelmingly winning democratic elections in 
may is rapidly losing support as the economic situation worsens 
many say the government which contains former communist party 
officials is undemocratic despite official assertions to the 
contrary others fault it for trying to lead the nation to 
capitalism too quickly and disregarding the human costs of mounting 
economic hardship 
in a televised report friday night government spokesman bogdan 
baltazar dismissed the unions decision to strike as illegal 
antinational and antihuman

the italian branch of amnesty international accused 
israel on saturday of violating international law by torturing 
palestinians and detaining them for long periods without charge 
the report marking the third anniversary of the palestinian 
uprising in the israelioccupied lands also charged that israeli 
authorities have allowed excessive use of firearms against 
palestinians 
the human rights group said tension in the occupied territories 
had grown worse in recent months it attributed the change to the 
formation of a rightwing israeli government an increase in 
killings by palestinians of suspected israeli collaborators and 
widespread support among palestinians for iraqi leader saddam 
hussein 
amnesty also said that thousands of palestinians had been 
subject to torture at the hands of israeli soldiers or in detention 
centers 
the methods included burning with cigarettes depriving people 
of sleep and covering their heads with hoods and striking them 
the report said at least six palestinians had died after being 
beaten in such cases it said 
amnesty international is seriously worried about the treatment 
of palestinians during detention and in particular the methods of 
interrogation practiced by security services it said 
it cited the case of rami muslah 14 of the buraij refugee camp 
in the gaza strip the italian group said the boy was arrested on 
sept 25 following the death of an israeli soldier in the camp 
a lawyer who was permitted to visit him on oct 29 said the boy 
had been beaten badly in the chest and head spit blood and had 
difficulty breathing and speaking amnesty said 
the boy said he had been beaten during his interrogation and 
that authorities put a gun to his head and said they would shoot 
him if he did not confess the human rights group said 
the report also said that at least 660 palestinians had been 
killed in three years by israelis using firearms nearly half the 
victims were under 18 the italian group said 
amnesty international feels particularly concerned about 
official directives on the use of firearms that seem to give 
consent without any justification to the killing of people not 
necessarily involved in activities that threaten the lives of other 
people the report by the italian group said 
the report also charged that more than 12000 palestinians had 
been held in administrative detention since the start of the 
uprising 
those held under the system are often not informed of charges 
against them or given prompt trials the italian group said 
it asked israeli to reexamine the system of administrative 
detention and free those held under it 
israel captured the gaza strip and west bank from arab neighbors 
during the 1967 middle east war leaders of the uprising are 
challenging israeli rule there

one year ago jennifer j casolo sat 
blindfolded in a cell in el salvador accused of concealing weapons 
for leftist guerrillas in an arrest that made her an antiwar cause 
celebre 
the 29yearold activist said she remains devoted to working for 
peace in the warravaged central american nation where she was 
imprisoned for 18 days 
a church worker in el salvador for four years casolo was 
arrested after authorities raided her house and unearthed dynamite 
grenades and more than 20000 rounds of ammunition from the garden 
she was charged with storing munitions for leftist rebels trying 
to overthrow the government authorities released her for lack of 
evidence and expelled her from the country 
casolo insists she is innocent 
the salvadoran government has stood by its charges and has 
since alleged that casolo was a drug trafficker and a main 
organizer of a us boycott of salvadoran coffee 
since her return to the united states last december casolo has 
given hundreds of speeches around the country recounting her 
eyewitness account of el salvadors 11year civil war 
she said she has received threatening telephone calls was 
arrested at a protest in front of the white house hired a booking 
agent and barely squeezes in a quiet social life 
i live and breathe el salvador she told the hartford 
courant in an interview published saturday i live with such an 
urgency about it every day theres not peace theres another 
person dead 
casolo a connecticut native recently moved to washington where 
she lives in a christian community of 25 people that bases its 
beliefs on the 13thcentury teachings of st francis of assisi who 
is associated with the simple love of nature 
her arrest brought her fame and the attention of us government 
leaders entertainers and socialites but casolo has stuck to a 
simple life preferring talks with church groups in appalachia to 
events in boston catered with salmon hors doeuvres 
since she returned to the united states last dec 14 little 
light has been shed on the charges against her 
at many of casolos speaking engagements conservative groups 
have hung protest banners and challenged her version of the arrest 
even in el salvador some denounce her a tshirt sold across 
the country depicts casolo as a bigmouthed stick figure surrounded 
by munitions it calls her la guerrilla internacionalista or 
the international guerilla 
casolo still fears her outspoken criticism of the us and 
salvadoran governments could bring her injury or death 
her future is uncertain she lives off honoraria and donations 
but requests for speaking engagements have declined and fewer 
people attend them now 
casolo said she knows americans are focused on the persian gulf 
but she hopes people will remember the 73000 people who have died 
in the salvadoran civil war and the millions of dollars in us aid 
that goes to el salvador each year 
the us congress recently passed a bill that starting in 
fiscal 1991 will halve the 85 million in military aid el salvador 
receives annually 
god has given me something somewhat unique i can raise 
peoples voices i can inspire people to do something she said

the spacecraft galileo grabbed earths 
gravity coattails saturday and arced around the planet on a 
fleeting visit home 13 months into a sixyear voyage to jupiter 
taking pictures and exploring with instruments galileo used 
earth as a gravity slingshot hurtling 597 miles above the western 
atlantic the point of closest approach 
the encounter at 1235 pm pst increased the crafts speed by 
11600 mph giving it a speed of 79000 mph relative to the sun 
relative to the earth which is also moving the maximum speed was 
30721 mph 
everything is working exactly as it should said mission 
director neal e ausman jr at nasas jet propulsion laboratory as 
the craft flew through earths shadow weve had no glitches no 
problems 
project officials said the flyby was a valuable dress rehearsal 
for the jupiter encounter 
every time we turn an instrument on we have problems 
understanding what weve done to it and what we probably can do to 
the software said clayne m yeates science and mission design 
manager so were really learning how to operate these 
instruments its been invaluable for us to collect this data 
project manager william j oneil added once we do figure out 
what theyre doing we find that theyre operating up to expectation 
or beyond 
galileos looping 24 billionmile route to jupiter made it the 
first planetary spacecraft to approach earth from space and 
provided scientists the first opportunity to look at the world in 
the same way as they have other planets 
controllers ordered galileos instruments to measure gases that 
cause greenhouse effect warming of the atmosphere and study 
highaltitude water vapor involved in creating and destroying the 
ozone layer 
the trajectory also allowed scientists to explore the far side 
of the moon always facing away from earth with modern instruments 
for the first time the far side observations will occur over 
several days 
galileo approached from earths dark side measuring its 
magnetic field and solar plasma flows and taking pictures of the 
crescent moon 
two pictures released soon after the flyby showed a portion of 
the nearside of the moon and a cloudstreaked view of central 
australia data and pictures will continue to come in as galileo 
speeds away 
its path also took it 2162 miles above the orbiting space 
shuttle columbia 
exploration of the blue planet and its moon was an added bonus 
to galileos 14 billion mission 
the spacecraft was originally designed to make a 2year direct 
flight to jupiter for longterm observation of the solar systems 
biggest planet 
but the national aeronautics and space administrations safety 
review after the explosion of the space shuttle challenger in 1986 
led to changes in galileos own booster system that made a direct 
flight impossible because its new rocket was less powerful 
shuttle atlantis carried galileo into orbit oct 18 1989 and 
launched it on a roundabout trajectory using three gravity assists 
from venus and earth 
the spacecraft flew past venus on feb 10 it will get another 
boost from earth on dec 8 1992 that encounter will be closer at 
an altitude of about 200 miles the pass will also greatly widen 
its orbit around the sun in order to intercept jupiter 
galileo will go into orbit around jupiter on dec 7 1995 
a probe launched from galileo five months earlier will plunge 
into the atmosphere at 100000 mph deploy a parachute and make 
measurements for 75 minutes until it is crushed by intense 
pressure 
the orbiter will continue to explore jupiter and 10 of its 16 
known moons for two years

about 175 relatives of fort campbell 
soldiers who died in a 1985 plane crash gathered saturday to mark 
the fifth anniversary of the disaster which was the target of 
congressional scrutiny last week 
a house judiciary subcommittee concluded wednesday that the 
federal government should review canadas findings in the crash at 
gander newfoundland which killed 256 soldiers on a flight home 
from a sixmonth middle east peacekeeping tour 
during saturdays observance the honorary commander of the 
regiment the victims served said relatives should concentrate on 
rebuilding their lives rather than dwell on the circumstances of 
the crash 
it has been five years of sorrow and healing and remembering 
lets keep it in perspective and continue to rebuild our lives as 
we have done since that tragic day retired col robert e jones 
told the crowd in gander memorial park which is dedicated to the 
tragedy 
jones said military service often means facing danger such as 
members of the 101st airborne division from fort campbell are 
confronting now in saudi arabia 
the way of the soldier and his family is often hard and 
fraught with danger as evidenced by the present deployment of our 
military forces overseas jones said 
jones was selected for the honorary post by the regiments 
troops before the dec 12 1985 crash but did not accompany the 
unit on its peacekeeping mission in the sinai peninsula 
the house judiciary subcommittee on crime heard testimony last 
week on a possible terrorist link to the disaster the panel 
concluded that canada should turn over its investigative reports on 
the crash to the fbi while the national transportation safety board 
analyzes the cause of the tragedy 
fbi agents were barred from the crash scene and the ntsb 
embraced canadas findings about the cause without consulting the 
chief us investigator who looked into the disaster according to 
testimony before the panel 
a canadian panel had concluded that the military charter plane 
probably went down because of ice on its wings the canadian 
findings have been challenged by other canadian investigators 
several congressmen and families of the victims who suspect 
terrorism as the cause 
but like jones some of the family members at the base saturday 
seemed o focus more on families of troops deployed in the persian 
gulf one was louise wright who lost her 23yearold brother 
john in the crash 
its not easy ms wright said we just have to deal with 
it i feel for the families who have members over there now 
nearby 248 canadian maple trees stand in uniform rows as a 
reminder of the same number of soldiers who died 
jeff mollohan who lost his 47yearold father attended the 
ceremony along with his wife and two children mollohan said the 
christmas season has been an especially hard time of year since the 
crash 
its changed a lot of things as far as what we look forward 
to mollohan said theres an empty void theres no way it can 
be replaced

deciding whether to go to war against baghdad i dont feel we 
are closer to a peaceful solution he said 
bush also denied any connection between the hostages release 
and his withdrawal of all american diplomats from kuwait as had 
been demanded by saddam hussein it is no payback bush 
declared 
you can make the argument that this facilitates the tough 
decisions that might lie ahead he said of the decision to bring 
out the diplomats he made the remarks at a news conference on the 
final day of a fivenation south american tour he returned to 
washington from his last stop caracas venezuela on saturday

plane in a prelude to an exodus of foreign captives about 900 
americans were among 8000 foreigners held against their will since 
iraqs invasion of kuwait aug 2 
when you dont have americans there and if force is required 
thats just one less worry ive got bush said renewing demands 
that iraq pull its forces out of kuwait

military action compared with 46 percent a month earlier 
but more than half the respondents said the unitedstates should 
wait longer than the jan 15 deadline for withdrawal set by the 
united nations to give diplomacy and economic sanctions more time 
to work 
the survey of 769 adults was taken thursday and friday and has a 
margin of error of plus or minus four points 
bush spoke in the sundrenched venezuelan capital as he wrapped 
up a trip that also included stops in brazil uruguay argentina 
and chile his goal was to salute the sweep of democracy throughout 
the western hemisphere but the message was obscured each day by 
the persian gulf crisis 
venezuelan president carlos andres perez standing alongside 
bush expressed solidarity with the stand against iraq he said 
small countries such as his own cannot accept for anybody to be 
able to delete by force the boundaries of an existing nation 
good answer bush told perez 
after iraq announced the release of the hostages the united 
states on friday said it would remove the handful of american 
diplomats who have manned the besieged embassy in kuwait 
the feeling is when every single american is out of kuwait we 
will clear the decks and the embassy will have ceased to be 
fulfilling any daytoday functions the president said 
but there is no payback there is no change in my 
determination to get saddam hussein out of kuwait in compliance 
with the united nations resolutions he added 
bush said the risk of war had not been diminished either by the 
hostages release or the easing of the global oil crunch 
i want a peaceful solution bush said i dont feel we are 
closer to a peaceful solution and the reason i dont is because 
saddam hussein continues insisting that kuwait is a province of 
iraq and that he will not get out of kuwait 
bush said im glad the hostages are coming home they never 
should have been taken in the first place 
when you kidnap somebody bush added you should not expect 
a reward when you let the person go 
he added i have said from the very beginning that this cruel 
policy of taking hostages and holding them in hopes that they will 
change the policy of this alliance is fruitless 
but i am very glad that these people are coming out 
the state department was pursuing arrangements saturday to 
evacuate americans from iraq 
us charge daffaires joseph wilson informed iraqi foreign 
ministry officials in baghdad that the united states had chartered 
a plane to pick up americans in kuwait on sunday morning fly them 
to baghdad take on additional americans there and continue later 
in the day to frankfurt an official said 
national security adviser brent scowcroft asked in a cnn 
newsmaker saturday interview whether freedom of the hostages 
would improve the atmosphere for iraqius talks responded not 
so far as were concerned 
scowcroft emphasized that the united states will neither 
negotiate with saddam nor make concessions there has been no 
change he said in the policy of trying to convince saddam 
hussein that he has two options and that is to withdraw or to 
face catastrophe 
bush praised venezuela for its increase in oil production in the 
face of the cut off from iraq and kuwait he said there is no 
worldwide shortage of oil despite the increasing prices 
he blamed the price surge on paper barrels of oil being 
manipulated by international futures markets 
perez said venezuela and mexico were helping the poor nations of 
central america and the caribbean to finance their oil imports 
however he said we cannot do the same with all of our latin 
american clients simply because we too have our own 
difficulties 
he said the surplus profits from oll sales were being deposited 
in an economic stabilization fund for the days when oil prices 
fall 
on another matter bush defended the presence of american 
military troops in panama and said he did not know how long they 
would be stationed there 
we want to see panamas democracy be successful and we would 
like to see them perfect their own policekeeping function so that 
they dont need any outside assistance to guarantee against 
uprising bush said

remembered saturday with spontaneous tributes in new york and los 
angeles a plaque in his hometown of liverpool and a rendition of 
yesterday on moscow television

section of central park opposite the manhattan apartment building 
where he was shot to death by a deranged fan on dec 8 1980 
others left flowers outside the dakota for his widow yoko ono 
john is an old friend of mine i grew up hearing his 
records said sam diaz 30 who came to leave a bouquet in 
strawberry fields i feel sad today i miss his music but ill 
never forget john lennon 
ono was not at the dakota apartment saturday said her 
spokesman elliot mintz she and the couples 15yearold son 
sean were marking the anniversary quietly in europe he said 
ono said earlier this year she chose to celebrate lennons 50th 
birthday rather than dwell on his death the oct 9 occasion was 
marked by a worldwide broadcast of lennons peace anthem 
imagine for an estimated 1 billion listeners 
strawberry fields played softly from a boom box saturday as 
visitors piled flowers and assorted mementos alongside a makeshift 
memorial fashioned from a cardboard box in central park 
an ink sketch of lennon looking down on the world topped the 
tribute which carried the handwritten message thank you john 
for showing us the way how to care for ourselves and the world 
visitors left behind a green apple symbolic of the beatles 
record label a burning candle encircled with strawberries and a 
glass of white wine 
in los angeles lennons star on the hollywood walk of fame was 
piled high with flowers saturday as about 200 people sat nearby 
singing songs many called for peace in the persian gulf 
the lyrics to such lennon songs as imagine and give peace 
a chance were plastered on the sides of buildings and on 
handheld signs 
we have to keep that message in our hearts especially with 
the crisis in the persian gulf said jerry rubin director of the 
los angeles chapter of the alliance for survival peace 
organization 
in his hometown of liverpool england people paid tribute along

providing the music in strawberry fields was tom hayes 37 
whose black sweatshirt bore the words john lennon 19401980 
thanks 
ive been up the last two nights making these tribute tapes 
six hours of lennon the beatles my wife thought i was nuts 
said hayes of saddle brook nj 
lennons legacy of good will brought hayes out early on an 
overcast day to sit and listen to the music 
everything he stood for was good for the world im here to 
pay tribute to that its just a sad sad day he said 
a halfdozen bouquets were left outside the dakota before noon 
the flowers were brought inside and sent upstairs to onos 
apartment said one of the buildings doormen outside fans looked 
at the spot where lennon was shot and moved on

chapman who is serving 20 years to life at attica state prison 
in new york recently apologized for the killing 
it was an end of innocence for that time and i regret being 
the one who ended it he said

facing the threat of a us veto the 
security council on saturday postponed discussion of a resolution 
calling for an eventual international peace conference on the 
middle east 
israel the traditional us ally in the region strongly 
opposes any international conference that would encompass the issue 
of palestinians in israelioccupied lands 
the council voted 94 to adopt a soviet motion to postpone 
consideration of the resolution until monday the united states 
voted in favor of postponement while france and china abstained 
when asked if an eventual us veto was likely the chief 
spokesman for the us mission phil arnold said that is my 
impression 
a us veto would anger americas arab allies in the antiiraq 
coalition assembled in the persian gulf who feel just as strongly 
about israels occupation of the west bank and gaza strip as they 
do about baghdads seizure of kuwait 
iraqi president saddam hussein has linked a peaceful settlement 
to the persian gulf crisis to a peace conference taking in the 
palestinian issue but the united states has said the gulf crisis 
cannot be tied to the palestinian problem or any other issue 
a veto by the united states or any of the other four permanent 
security council members would kill the un resolution but most 
other council members appear to support the measure 
the resolution sponsored by yemen cuba malaysia and colombia 
endorses the idea of a middle east peace conference at an 
appropriate time that would help achieve a comprehensive 
settlement and lasting peace in the middle east 
the united states has not vetoed a security council resolution 
since the aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
us ambassador thomas r pickering met with israeli premier 
yitzhak shamir just before the security council session began 
saturday shamir is on a us visit and is scheduled to meet with 
president bush on tuesday 
the council met in private session for hours saturday evening 
with the united states trying to reach a lastminute compromise 
with the nonaligned nations favoring the resolution 
diplomats said the united states was pushing for removal of 
language endorsing a peace conference at the appropriate time 
but the nonaligned nations insisted that it be left in some of 
those nations support the palestine liberation organization 
us policy has long called for a middle east peace conference 
at some appropriate future date but the united states has always 
blocked the security council from approving the idea by adopting 
similar language 
earlier this week however the united states and the other 
permanent council members approved of a draft resolution that would 
let the security council consider adopting that position but that 
united states backed away from its earlier approval after issuing a 
flurry of denials that it was trying to satisfy saddam 
precisely because of our consistent position that we will not 
link the gulf crisis and the arabisraeli dispute this is 
certainly not an appropriate time for an international 
conference secretary of state james a baker iii said thursday

for walmart stores inc its one down 
and one to go 
the bentonville arkbased retailer slipped past kmart in 
november to become americas no 2 retailer according to sales 
figures released this week now industry analysts say that early 
next year walmart will overtake sears roebuck and co as the 
nations top retailer 
even sears is conceding defeat 
in terms of dollar signs they will surpass us theres no 
doubt about it gordon jones a sears spokesman said friday 
the figures showed chicagobased sears with 2748 billion in 
sales for the first 10 months of 1990 walmart sales for the same 
period were 2546 billion but walmarts growth rate was 25 
percent while sears grew at just 21 percent 
kmarts sales for the first 10 months of the year totaled 252 
billion 
analysts say walmarts strong growth rate will allow the 
discount retailer to bump sears for the no 1 spot 
walmart probably will fall 500 million or 1 billion short of 
sears by jan 31 the close of walmarts fiscal year said stacy 
dutton an analyst with morgan stanley and co in new york 
but then next year its all walmart ms dutton predicted 
sears will have about 325 billion in revenues from domestic 
and foreign merchandising and credit for this current fiscal year 
she said walmart will total about 315 billion to 32 billion 
this fiscal year she said 
it will be real close but clearly next year walmart will 
surpass sears especially with the acquisitions theyve made 
said craig weichmann an analyst with morgan keegan and co in 
memphis 
last month walmart announced it planned to buy the wholesale 
club inc in october it said it would acquire mclane co inc the 
countrys sixthlargest grocery distributor 
walmart officially passed kmart as the no 2 retailer in the 
country in november with 2546 billion in sales for 10 months 
compared with kmarts 252 billion

iraq has redrawn its border with kuwait in what 
could signal plans to withdraw as early as next month a newspaper 
reported sunday 
the observer in a story from washington said iraq was laying 
claim to an area of the rumaila oilfield and the islands of warba 
and bubiyan in the persian gulf 
most arab governments expect iraq to withdraw from the rest of 
kuwait in late january but completion of the new border fence 
may imply an even earlier withdrawal said the report citing 
unidentified arab sources in washington 
the report said iraq has constructed a new international line by 
building a barbedwire fence around the southern tip of the 
oilfield which extends into northern kuwait iraq has claimed the 
area 
the newspaper said some information for the report came from an 
unidentified source who attended the recent baghdad talks between 
iraqi president saddam hussein king hussein of jordan and 
palestinian leader yasser arafat 
the observer said ali alsabah a counselor at the kuwaiti 
embassy in london confirmed that his exiled government in saudi 
arabia had received reports of the fence 
alsabah could not be reached for comment early sunday

votes or 502 percent and 45255 yes votes or 498 percent a 
margin of just 369 against the referendum 
voter turnout was reported to be light across the city 
i think everybody is out doing everything else said mark 
rupe a precinct worker in east dallas said on saturday afternoon 
since its on a saturday they have everything else on their 
mind 
people might say well i really dont know what this is all 
about and decide to go fishing he said 
supporters of the proposal to create singlemember districts say 
the plan would have helped ease racial inequities that make it 
difficult for minorities to get elected

a plan voters approved last year that called for some candidates to 
be elected by district others by region and one at large 
under the system instituted in 197 eight council members are 
elected in individual districts and another three including the 
mayor are elected by voters citywide 
the system voters approved in august 1989 called for 10 
candidates to be chosen by district four by region and one at 
large but that system was never implemented because a federal 
judge suggested he would rule it unconstitutional 
saturdays referendum was held as part of the settlement of a 
1988 federal lawsuit brought by roy williams and marvin crenshaw 
who failed in their atlarge council bids the men both black 
charged the existing election system made it difficult for 
minorities to win election 
black and hispanic leaders nationwide have long charged that 
atlarge elections dilute minority candidates political power and 
make it difficult for them to win office 
they maintain minorities have a better chance of winning office 
under a political system in which candidates are elected by 
individual districts 
although minorities are estimated to make up more than half the 
citys population only two of 11 city council members are black 
none are hispanic 
only one minority a hispanic who no longer serves on the 
council has won an atlarge city council election 
if the plan had been approved a commission would have been set 
up to draw new district lines next year using 1990 census figures 
in the 1980 census dallas racial makeup consisited of 61 
percent white 26 percent black and 12 percent hispanic but a 
breakdown of the 1990 census of 982250 people is expected to show 
a majority black and hispanic population

stock price over the past six months the 90pershare deal was 
rejected by ncrs board at midweek the company called the figure 
inadequate but said it would be willing to talk turkey at 125 per 
share

executives and take its case directly to the companys shareholders 
in the form a tender offer of 90 cash for each share of ncr 
expiring jan 4 
early in the week the two companies were exchanging cordial 
correspondence dear bob and dear chuck topped the letters 
from ncr chief charles exley and atampt boss robert allen but by
