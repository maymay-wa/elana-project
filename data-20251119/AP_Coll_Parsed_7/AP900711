energy secretary james watkins said wednesday 
a nuclear weapons plant in the pacific northwest released enough 
radiation in the 1940s to pose a serious health hazard to nearby 
residents 
it was the first time the government has acknowledged that 
radiation emissions from the hanford nuclear reservation were high 
enough to cause illnesses incluuding cancer in people living 
nearby 
watkins speaking in advance of a study on the richland wash 
plant to be released thursday said the implications of the 
report are serious 
watkins said the report is expected to contain estimates of 
potentially large doses of radiation from the hanford plant from 
1944 to 1947 
when i say high i mean significantly high 3000 rads 
thousands of rads he said 
a rad is a measure of radiation exposure to human tissue the 
nuclear regulatory commission requires that facilities it licenses 
limit yearly radiation exposure from airborne emissions to 15 
thousandths of a rad 
he said between 350000 and 400000 curies of radioactive 
material was released in one episode in 1945 a curie is the amount 
of radiation emitted in one second by 1400 pounds of enriched 
uranium 
the study being released thursday is the first part of a 
fiveyear 15 million study that is the first major research into 
accidental and intentional release of massive amounts of radiation 
that drifted from hanford into ten nearby washington and oregon 
counties 
the report will cover emissions but not the health effects of 
the radiation said angela beers spokeswoman for the panel of 18 
nongovernment scientists and experts that directed the review 
but a parallel study under way at the centers for disease 
control will use the exposure estimates to try to document cases of 
thyroid disease among hanford area residents she said 
watkins said at his press conference that the main source of 
worrisome exposure was radioiodine the same isotope that caused 
radiation sickness in some residents who lived near the soviet 
unions nuclear power plant at chernobyl when radiation was 
released in a 1986 accident 
a number of people who lived across the columbia river from 
hanfords nine reactors claimed the 1940s emissions caused cancer 
and thyroidrelated illnesses 
i dont want you to think we do this today watkins said 
we are not casual about this today but we do have to go back and 
look at what happened to people we dont know who was at the right 
spot at the wrong time we have to learn lessons out of this and 
be sensitive to the human beings who were there at the time 
the hanford environmental dose reconstruction project uses 
computer models to estimate how much radiation escaped when 
plutonium was produced at the 560squaremile nuclear plant 
scientists will use the firstphase estimates to test and refine 
computer models over the next two years during the second phase 
said john till a south carolina nuclear scientist and the panels 
chairman 
radioactive iodine was produced when spent reactor fuel rods 
were chemicall dissolved to produce weaponsgrade plutonium and 
uranium when it concentrates in the thyroid gland iodine131 can 
cause cancer and other diseases 
judith jurji president of the hanford downwinders coalition 
said she and five members of her family have hypothyroidism which 
causes sluggishness and puffiness her father and two uncles worked 
at hanford from 1949 to 1956 
however it would be very difficult to prove a longterm illness 
was caused by exposure more than 40 years ago and law prohibits 
lawsuits against the government said jim thomas of the 
spokanebased hanford education action league 
researchers studied air emissions from 1944 to 1947 and 
contaminated cooling water emissions into the columbia river from 
1964 to 1967 in part because those were years of highest radiation 
releases and the best documented ms beers said 
weaponsgrade plutonium was produced at the plant from 1943 
until 1988 but radiation emissions steadily decreased over the 
last 30 years 
the energy department is paying for the study but has no 
supervisory authority

summer replacement series gave television 
viewers some alternatives during the july fourth holiday week but 
reruns got the top ratings 
networks put the dogs on said david marans a senior 
researcher for the j walter thompson advertising agency these 
are shows that will not be on the fall schedule almost without 
exception the public has not liked these shows 
according to ac nielsen co ratings released tuesday the four 
halfhours of nbcs toprated thursday night lineup won the weeks 
highest ratings it was the first time since february that nbc had 
the top four shows 
a cheers rerun was no 1 a repeat of the cosby show was 
second the pilot episode of blossom a potential midseason 
entry was third and a repeat of the seinfeld chronicles pilot 
was fourth 
marans said ratings for blossom were boosted by having 
cosby precede it just as the toprated cheers episode 
pulled up the seinfeld ratings 
those shows were all weaker than the repeats that went on 
before them marans said the networks have got to be very 
disappointed 
blossom turned in the best performance for an nbc pilot so 
far this summer the network said the comedy stars mayim bialyk 
who plays a 13yearold coming of age in los angeles 
the second highestrated summer sitcom was abcs dads a 
dog which stars david steinberg it opened in 21st place 
overall nbc was the no 1 network for the eighth consecutive 
week with a 90 average but was barely ahead of abc which had an 
89 average cbs was third with a 76 average the fox broadcasting 
co had a 60 average 
a rating point represents 921000 households 
nbc has won 39 of the past 42 weeks but marans said nbcs 
losses and abcs gains will have the two networks closely battling 
for first place in the weeks ahead 
rounding out the top 10 shows were cbs designing women and 
60 minutes at fifth and sixth nbcs empty nest at no 7 
nbcs golden girls and cbs murphy brown tied for eighth 
and abcs roseanne and foxs married with children tied 
for 10th 
fox had two other shows in the top 20 in living color at 
no 15 and cops at 17 
in the evening news broadcasts abc continued its domination 
with an 84 rating cbs was second with a 74 rating and nbc was 
third with a 69

dressed in expensive gold jewelry and designer 
casual wear a man being arraigned on drug possession charges says 
he made up to 90000 over three years in washingtons illegal 
narcotics trade 
i can go out here stand on a corner and wait for business to 
come to me you know the man who identified himself only as 
archie a 21yearold district of columbia resident said tuesday 
i work for somebody but i dont have anybody standing over 
me i just have to give the people what they want take their 
money make sure it gets back to where it belongs and get my cut 
he said 
archie said he made between 75000 to 90000 over three 
years 
the lure of making large sums of money in a short period of time 
is the main reason why many poor black urban males in the nations 
capital participate in the underground drug trade according to a 
study released by the rand corp on tuesday 
the report was based on information gathered among 186 
washington dc men aged 1840 who said they had been involved in 
drug activity and were on probation it said the average 
streetlevel operative is a poor urban black male who makes a 
median income of 24000 annually from narcotics sales 
archie who is black and who lives in a poorer section of 
washington fits the statistical profile he said he viewed the 
charges facing him in dc superior court as part of the cost of 
plying his illegal trade 
i dont have no supervisor i dont have no overhead and i 
dont have no hassles the only thing i got to worry about is being 
picked up by the law he said 
this is my fifth arrest but ive never been convicted and 
this just interrupts what i do 
archies lawyer angela burns confirmed that her client had 
been arrested five times in the past three years on drug and 
weapons charges but had no convictions 
the rand report also used information supplied by the city 
government about the 24000 people arrested for selling or 
possessing drugs from 1985 through 1987 and a survey of 387 boys 
aged 15 to 18 
the report estimated that in 1987 an estimated 24000 district 
residents were selling drugs on the street for the three in eight 
who were dealing drugs every day the median monthly earnings were 
2000 or 30 an hour taxfree after expenses 
that compares with the 7 an hour from the legitimate jobs that 
75 percent of the probationers reported holding 
the study found that dealers active at least two days a week 
face a 22 percent chance of going to prison a 7 percent chance of 
severe injury and a 14 percent chance of being killed a fatality 
rate 100 times that of the general work force 
given those risks long periods of steady earnings are 
unlikely to be common the report said 
the estimated median income of streetlevel drug dealers was 
higher than the average 12898 earned by retail trade workers in 
198788 according to the city government 
construction workers made 24879 on average while service 
industry workers made 26545 the average annual salary for all 
private sector workers was 25857 while government employees made 
32118 
but those workers are subject to federal and local income tax 
withholding 
economist peter reuter the chief author of the rand study 
said the creation of considerably higher paying legitimate jobs 
probably wouldnt get us very far dealers would still have smaller 
total incomes than they can earn now by supplementing their regular 
wages with drug selling also many of them have expensive drug 
habits 
reuter said in an interview that while most streetlevel sales 
were by blacks the availability of drugs in washington affects not 
just the citys predominantly black population but white 
suburbanites as well 
while a typical city street dealers earnings arent enough to 
finance flashy cars and lavish lifestyles it is the image of such 
luxuries that draw many young men into selling drugs he said

its stadiums are shabby its fans remain rowdy and 
it still cant produce a tennis player good enough to get past the 
second round at wimbledon 
forget all that england was back on top of the sports heap 
tuesday at least from its own island vantage point 
fans could fill themselves with pride along with beer at the 
local pub as within 4 hours on a typically cloudy summer day two 
events restored the nation so long associated with the downside of 
sport to no 1 
first the european soccer federation voted to readmit english 
clubs into two of its three continental tournaments next year 
the clubs were banned in 1985 when 39 people died in a rampage 
by english fans through a belgian stadium 
we are back read the inchhigh headline on the evening 
standard londons afternoon newspaper 
sports minister colin moynihan hailed it as the dawning of a 
new era 
then just as the country was drinking in that dram of good news 
came a double shot england won a cricket series on home soil for 
the first time in five years 
bbctv interrupted its news headlines to announce the victory 
the excitement was understandable england gave the game to the 
world but in recent years the world has caught up and the last 
time the english won a homefield test series a string of major 
international matches each lasting five days was against 
australia in 1985 
they defeated sri lanka at home in 1988 but that was something 
like the oakland athletics beating the toledo mud hens 
tuesdays events heightened an already giddy feeling around 
english sports 
the national soccer team did much better than expected at the 
world cup reaching the semifinals before losing in a shootout to 
west germany the eventual champion prime minister margaret 
thatcher wants to have the players over for tea an invitation that 
would have been unthinkable just a month ago given the national 
humiliation brought upon her country by rowdy fans 
english racecar driver nigel mansell is a favorite at this 
weekends british grand prix formula 1 event and next week nick 
faldo of england probably the best golfer in the world has a 
chance to add the british open to his us masters titles from the 
last two years 
but all is not as rosy as an english garden 
soccer authorities still dont know how they will meet new 
stadium safety rules imposed after 95 deaths in a crush of fans at 
a game last year the government remains redfaced over the 
expulsion of more than 300 english soccer fans from italy after 
fights in sardinia rimini and turin 
and the tennis the land of fred perry and virginia wade failed 
to get a player into the third round of the mens or womens 
singles at wimbledon again this year and british bookies laid odds 
before the tournament of 1000to1 against a homegrown mens 
champion and 20001 against a womens winner 
the odds against an alien landing on earth this century are 
1001 
those bookies may hum god save the queen as they figure the 
hunches but they dont let the tune cloud their minds 
when the european soccer federation announced its decision on 
readmission william hill one of the countrys biggest bookmakers 
offered 71 against an english club winning a european trophy next 
season

the bush administratation says the most useful 
thing it can do now for the soviet union rather than send cold 
hard cash is to give it a few lessons in good old american 
knowhow 
sending experts abroad to help needy countries known as 
technical assistance in foreignpolicy jargon has been a 
centerpiece of the us foreign aid program for years and now it 
is a feature of the new spirit of cooperation between the 
superpowers 
some allies including west germany and france hoped the united 
states and other industrial democracies would go much further and 
agree at the economic summit in houston to fashion a coordinated 
package of direct assistance to the reeling soviet economy 
president bush among others resisted the dispute was blunted 
for the time being when the seven summit partners agreed instead 
tuesday to organize a quick study of the soviet unions needs 
meanwhile the summit leaders gave gorbachev a warm endorsement 
and pledged to help in practical ways those countries that choose 
freedom 
and a tentative draft of the communique to be issued at the 
close of the summit today said prospects for fundamental and 
longterm economic aid could improve if the soviet union comes to a 
substantial change in resources from military to civilian 
production and ends the support to those states which create 
regional conflict 
the western leaders called for group of international financial 
institutions under international monetary fund supervision to 
conduct the soviet study and complete it by years end but the 
world bank part of that group immediately pronounced the deadline 
unrealistic saying a study of this nature would take a long time 
a year or so 
in the interim for the united states to extend even technical 
assistance is a gesture that is downright revolutionary when 
measured by the standards of just 8 years ago 
after the polish governments crackdown with soviet 
acquiescence on the solidarity labor union in december 1981 the 
western allies were debating how severely to punish the soviets 
economically now the debate is focused on how much the kremlin 
should be rewarded for its change of heart under mikhail 
gorbachevs stewardship 
bush and gorbachev set in motion the concept of us technical 
assistance at the malta summit seven months ago officials now say 
an acceleration of that cooperation may be possible 
technical assistance can cover a variety of different endeavors 
in panama it means helping the government form a new police force 
in nicaragua us experts are helping to implement the 
governments economic policy in el salvador american advisers are 
trying to upgrade the countrys woefully deficient judicial system 
the us position on the soviet union is that direct aid would 
merely be wasted by a system plagued by gross inefficiencies baker 
said on tuesday the biggest favor the west could do for the soviets 
would be to offer its advice to help gorbachev achieve his goal of 
streamlining the soviet economy a number of private experts agree 
with that approach 
some ideas which are at various stages of discussion include 
helping the soviets devise a consumer price index and a stock 
market in a transition to a market economy 
leon aron of the heritage foundation a conservative research 
group said the united states is uniquely positioned among the 
allies to offer advice on these areas to a country as large as the 
soviet union because of the scale of the us economy 
aron rejected the suggestion of some european nations that 
direct financial aid to the soviet union is feasible he said that 
because of systemic inefficiencies there is 8 billion worth of 
imported equipment languishing unopened in soviet ports 
a blank check is wasted he said 
ed a hewitt of the brookings institution said us experts 
could aid the soviets in overcoming such problems as getting food 
to the market place about a third of all soviet food rots before 
reaching the dinner table because of inadequate transportation or 
storage facilities he said 
both hewitt and richard feinberg executive vice president of 
the overseas development council strongly support a major role for 
the world bank and international monetary fund in helping the 
soviets 
financial stabilization and structural changes are sorely needed 
in the soviet union and are precisely the areas the bank and the 
fund have been set up to deal with feinberg said 
the imf makes loans to developing countries providing they agree 
to undertake measures that it believes are necessary to put them on 
a sounder economic footing 
feinberg says that among the imfs success stories are turkey 
mexico bolivia and chile critics argue that imf policies have 
impoverished some countries 
the soviets are not now in a position to benefit from the fund 
or the bank because they are not members of either institution but 
they have indicated a desire to join and the bush administration 
reportedly is weighing options on the subject 
there are other ways the united states could help the soviets 
short of direct assistance 
as an example if the kremlins drop barriers to emigration the 
united states could waive the socalled jacksonvanik amendment 
thereby permitting normal trade between the two countries 
that step in turn could be followed by us trade credits and 
the easing of high technology exports the soviets may act on the 
emigration question in september 
will direct us aid ever be in the cards 
i dont think you should ever say never baker said tuesday 
things can change

gun groups and their critics are already 
gearing up for a fight in the house as the senate prepares to 
approve a major anticrime bill with curbs on nine kinds of 
semiautomatic assault rifles 
we are certainly going to lobby to keep the house crime bill 
free of gun control and when they get to a conference committee we 
are going to try to strip the gun provisions out of the senate 
bill national rifle association lobbyist james baker said 
tuesday 
the senate planned to vote today on its crime package which 
would ban the import or domestic manufacture of nine semiautomatic 
weapons 
the measure also calls for capital punishment for 34 federal 
offenses ranging from presidential assassination to treason 
before voting on the measure the senate first must wrap up one 
loose end involving provisions designed to combat savings and loan 
fraud 
debate over other specific provisions of the bill however was 
completed last month and the measure is not expected to have 
trouble winning approval 
the bill also would limit death row appeals with an eye toward 
ending delays of a decade or more in carrying out executions but 
states would have to provide free lawyers to carry out the appeals 
other provisions would toughen the nations moneylaundering 
laws increase aid for local law enforcement strengthen federal 
investigative agencies expand funding for boot camp prisons 
and create a police corps scholarship program for peace 
officers 
and the bill calls for penalties for using and dealing in the 
new drug ice and adds steroids to the list of controlled 
substances 
the house judiciary committee is working on its own version of 
comprehensive crime legislation 
that measure does not contain major firearms provisions but the 
house panel already has approved a firearms bill that is awaiting 
floor action it could easily be combined with the crime measure 
congressional aides said 
the house gun bill would outlaw domestic semiautomatic weapons 
that fail to meet the sporting purposes test under which a 
number of firearms manufactured overseas are now kept out of the 
country 
the nra traditionally an influential force on capitol hill was 
beaten repeatedly in the senate as it sought over the last two 
months to strip firearms provisions out of the crime bill 
sponsors credited lobbying by police organizations the 
washingtonbased group handgun control inc had also been pushing 
hard to maintain the curbs on semiautomatic weapons 
the senate bill at one time was part of president bushs 
anticrime package but over the last year it has virtually been 
rewritten on capitol hill and the administration now lacks 
enthusiasm for it 
the campaign for curbs on semiautomatic assault rifles began 
after a 1989 stockton calif schoolyard massacre by a man 
carrying a semiautomatic version of an ak47 rifle 
banned for import or domestic manufacture under the bill would 
be

nasa rejected a bidder on the hubble space 
telescope that planned tests to detect focusing flaws and instead 
picked a company that proposed no such tests and made mirrors with 
a fuzzy view of the universe a space agency official says 
eastman kodak co in its effort to win the contract to build 
the hubble mirrors proposed a final assembly testing of the 
telescope optics nasa deputy administrator james r thompson told 
a senate panel tuesday 
nasa however gave the contract to perkinelmer corp now 
hughes danbury optical systems inc which did not plan the fully 
assembled tests and the agency chose not to order the tests 
because they were so expensive thompson said 
the hubble telescope now in orbit is disabled because of a 
focusing flaw that might have been found by tests proposed in the 
kodak bid 
in retrospect perhaps an allsystems test could have been 
done or should have been done thompson told the science and 
space subcommittee 
officials of the national aeronautics and space administration 
declined to say why perkinelmer was selected for the hubble 
contract but nasa spokesman bill sheehan said perkinelmer had 
on balance more strength 
perkinelmers experience in building spy satellites may have 
been a factor other sources said 
the danbury conn firms winning bid in 1977 was for 634 
million but the total value of the contract swelled through cost 
overruns and changes to 451 million almost 20 million of that 
was paid by nasa as award fees which are given based on 
performance evaluation 
stephen beale a nasa procurement officer said an additional 
43 million in award fees for the company are under consideration 
sen albert gore dtenn who chaired the hearing charged that 
nasas recent problems with a crippled telescope and a space 
shuttle fleet grounded by hydrogen leaks may be related to an 
agency mindset to reject any pessimistic news 
gore said congress was no longer going to be satisfied with 
what he called nasas proclivity to shoot the messenger and not 
give credence to troublesome studies 
he said the agency for instance rejected some studies 
predicting that within the next decade there could be another 
accident like the challenge explosion that killed seven astronauts 
in 1986 
thompson in a heated exchange called the charge unfair 
he said nasa recognized that there are risks in space flight and 
that another space shuttle could be lost eventually 
if you fly 100 times and i tell you that were not going to 
lose another one that wouldnt pass the sanity test said 
thompson if we fly 100 more we may lose another one 
but he added i think the chance is very very low with the 
team we have in place 
meanwhile hubble space telescope experts told a news conference 
that they have moved closer to determining which of two mirrors on 
the observatory spacecraft had been cut to the wrong prescription 
all of the evidence is beginning to point toward the primary 
mirror and not the secondary mirror said ed weiler chief 
project scientist for the hubble 
the telescope has two mirrors a 94inch primary and a 12inch 
secondary that are suspects in the focusing flaw that has 
handicapped hubble experts are working to determine which mirror 
is flawed this will help make corrective optics for a replacement 
camera that will be installed by 1993 
if the primary mirror is at fault weiler said it will be 
easier to correct than if the problem was in the secondary mirror 
the secondary mirror reflects light from the primary mirror into 
the telescopes instruments

former gov arch a moore jr whose 
crimes included extorting more than half a million dollars from a 
coal operator has been sentenced to five years and 10 months in 
prison and fined 170000 
moore 67 appeared stoic during his sentencing tuesday on five 
corruption charges he was ordered to report to a federal prison in 
petersburg va on july 31 
arch moore is a criminal assistant us attorney joe savage 
said before sentencing if there is one thing missing from that 
man its remorse 
moore pleaded guilty to charges of mail fraud extortion 
obstruction of justice and filing false income tax returns during 
his 1984 and 1988 campaigns and during his third term from 198589 
us district judge walter hoffman on monday had refused to let 
moore withdraw his guilty pleas moore had argued he was coerced by 
federal prosecutors 
moore a republican who also was a us congressman for 12 
years refused to comment on the sentence an appeal is pending 
defense attorney william hundley said 
moores corruption involved campaignfunding violations not 
raids on the treasury hundley said 
i submit he served well and honorably hundley added 
us attorney michael carey said moore likely will serve at 
least 2 years before being considered for parole 
moore served as governor from 1969 to 1977 and again from 1985 
to 1989 longer than any governor in the states history he was 
only the second republican since 1933 to govern west virginia 
where democrats outnumber republicans by a 2to1 margin 
moore pleaded guilty may 8 to extorting 573000 from coal 
operator h paul kizer of beckley in return for a 21 million 
refund from the states black lung fund which provides benefits to 
coal miners 
moore also pleaded guilty to trying to block a federal grand 
jury investigation into corruption in his administration and 
allegations he used illegal cash contributions in his 1988 campaign 
he also admitted filing false income tax returns in 1984 and 
1985 and defrauding the state of his salary and benefits by 
funneling 100000 in illegal cash payments into his 1984 campaign 
to buy votes 
hoffman sentenced moore to five years on the extortion charge 
six months on mail fraud and two years each on the tax fraud 
counts all are to be served concurrently moore also got 10 months 
for the obstruction of justice charge which carries a mandatory 
prison term 
moore could have gotten 36 years in prison and fines of 125 
million 
moore is not the first west virginia governor to be convicted on 
federal charfes democrat ww wally barron who served from 
1961 to 1965 was convicted of bribing the foreman of a jury that 
acquitted him of bribery in 1968 he served three years and four 
months of a 12year sentence

while the worlds spotlight remains trained on 
the deliberations of seven western leaders here the city of 
houston is plying the news media for its share of attention 
about 4000 reporters are in town for the economic summit and 
civic leaders have spared no effort to put them in a good mood 
about the city already favorable stories about houstons 
rebounding economy have brought calls from interested japanese and 
european corporations mayor kathy whitmire said tuesday 
we specifically asked for the opportunity to host the economic 
summit because we wanted the chance to focus the worldwide 
attention on what is happening here in houston whitmire said 
tuesday 
we felt that there ought to be some way that we can take 
advantage of your presence here she said 
boosters have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars to 
present the credentialed reporters with free food alcohol 
tshirts tote bags and even toothpaste thats become the standard 
formula for any city playing host to preeminent news events like 
summits political conventions or sports extravaganzas 
houstonians make no secret of their motives 
frankly the people from washington told us early on that the 
media attitude at previous summits was affected by the preparation 
and presentation of the food said ben love a retired bank 
chairman who helped organize the media center 
but houston was miffed when the three television networks turned 
a cold shoulder to hot houston and chose not to broadcast their 
news shows from the summit a snub that was frontpage news locally 
and when whitmire and some pillars of the community staged a 9 
am summit news conference tuesday in an auditorium that can hold 
more than 1000 people 50 civic boosters outnumbered the handful 
of reporters 
ive heard you reporters stay up pretty late at night 
and maybe dont get up so early in the morning love said this 
may be some confirmation of that 
no matter the tiny turnout wasnt cause for concern 
when i see 10 or 11 television cameras across the back of the 
room im very much aware of the potential they have for reaching 
very large numbers of people whitmire said you dont have to 
have large numbers to impress me 
past summit cities have found fame to be fleeting and the 
economic impact of the event to be overrated but houston was 
undeterred 
a group of business and city leaders raised more than 10 
million to host the summit about 250000 is being spent on a 
food pavilion buffet tables available to reporters 24 hours a 
day 
whitmire says its been a smart investment 
i dont think i could put a dollar figure on the value of the 
international attention that this community is receiving she 
said i think it certainly will be many times over the amount 
thats been invested i can assure you of that 
however not everyone was thrilled about the summit 
houston city councilman john goodner told reporters tuesday 
ive had about all the honor of this i can stand 
in light of all the things that are going on how difficult it 
is to transverse this city i would hope the next time that 
president bush or any other president wants to honor us i hope he 
honors dallas he said

anthems played flags unfurled videotape rolled 
and then the leaders of the western world shook hands yet again 
if the small talk was running thin it didnt show 
president bush and several other summit leaders had been through 
all the pomp and ceremony less than a week ago that was at the 
nato gathering in london 
for the four european leaders here houston was the third time 
in three weeks that theyve lined up for group photographs 
attended state banquets and pondered weighty communiques 
britains margaret thatcher west germanys helmut kohl italys 
giulio andreotti and frances francois mitterrand began the long 
summer of summitry in the irish capital dublin with a european 
community summit at the end of june 
only japans toshiki kaifu added a fresh face in houston 
economic summits were once a highlight of the year a rare 
chance to hobnob with allied peers and walk the world stage 
but with the upheaval in eastern europe and accelerating moves 
toward closer unity among the west europeans summits have become 
almost routine 
during the bush administration there have already been two 
summits of the north atlantic treaty organization the european 
community holding regular emergency summits has virtually 
doubled its regular sixmonthly meetings 
the dynamics are changing but in the view of some analysts the 
lack of novelty doesnt diminish the significance 
i think summits are more important now said robert hormats 
a vice president of goldman sachs international who from 1975 to 
1982 was the us economic sherpa the aide who prepares the 
presidents agenda for summits 
during the cold war period security concerns bound us 
together in the west he said now these will no longer be as 
strong and you need something to bind and these will be economic 
issues if they are managed correctly 
hormats also sees summits as a discipline against insularity 
and for an economically less dominant united states an important 
forum for wielding influence through consensus 
it keeps them all constructively engaged in the global system 
because they know if they are not someone will raise the point 
when they next meet its a collective peer pressure exercise 
he said 
it has also become a lot less formal behind the closed doors 
according to aides to prime minister margaret thatcher 
she should know shes the western worlds longest serving 
leader and houston was her 12th economic summit 
in the beginning she routinely turned up at summits in combative 
moods and often became the center of a dispute particularly with 
her fellow europeans 
but over the years she has come to recognize the value of 
summits said an aide speaking on condition of anonymity the 
leaders do get to know each other and now its become easier it 
has also become a lot less predictable 
but what do they actually do apart from talk 
c fred bergsten director of the washingtonbased institute for 
international economics and a former senior us treasury official 
said that in the 1980s the economic summits drifted into general 
political issues and became a lot less actionoriented 
in my view they deteriorated enormously said bergsten 
i really hope and think theres a chance that this first one 
of the 90s will go back to make some headway on a few concrete 
issues he added citing farm subsidies free trade and soviet 
aid 
but hormats like many observers thinks the summits could use a 
lot fewer words ceremonials photo opportunities and the 
blowbyblow briefings that officials give to the hundreds of 
reporters who gather round 
it would be a lot better if they changed these laundrylist 
communiques covering every conceivable issue hormats said 
and in my view these summits will have come of age when there 
doesnt need to be so much hoopla 
bush spokesman marlin fitzwater said the leaders comfortable 
with one another hashed out most of the issues themselves rather 
than relying on aides 
the issues theyve dealt with in this summit have been real 
and dealt with by the heads at the table in a more direct way than 
any ive ever seen said fitzwater who has been to five economic 
summits 
for the summiteers theres no relief in sight 
the european community has already scheduled an extra meeting in 
october nato has invited president mikhail s gorbachev to speak 
perhaps this year and a really big summit a mass gathering of 
the 35 nations of east and west in the conference on security and 
cooperation in europe is expected before years end

most cosmetic surgery to improve the 
appearance of military dependents retirees and their dependents 
will be halted at military hospitals under a new defense department 
policy 
but such procedures will not be totally barred for activeduty 
military personnel a pentagon spokeswoman said tuesday 
such operations will be conducted only on a very limited 
basis said spokeswoman susan hansen it will be done on the 
lowest priority and there must be no other requirement for the 
surgical theater at the time 
the pentagon reviewed its policy on procedures such as 
facelifts breast enlargements and liposuctions after receiving an 
inquiry from rep john murtha dpa chairman of the house 
appropriations defense subcommittee 
in april the san diego tribune reported that the san diego 
naval hospital one of four navy hospitals with an extensive 
plastic surgery department had performed 544 cosmetic procedures 
in the past two years and that air force and army hospitals 
performed similar cosmetic surgeries 
pentagon officials have argued that it is important for military 
surgeons to perform such procedures as part of their training 
but following a review of the legislative history of the policy 
defense department officials decided that a better 
interpretation of the legislation governing such procedures was 
needed ms hansen said 
consequently facelifts and other procedures relating to the 
aging process and any procedure performed for personal 
nontherapeutic reasons to improve the appearance will not be 
provided for activeduty dependents or retirees and their 
dependents using appropriated funds a pentagon statement said 
surgeries for the correction of a congenital abnormality 
reconstructive surgery following an injury or surgical or 
therapeutic trauma and postmastectomy breast reconstruction will 
be allowed the statement added 
ms hansen said the military services will develop procedures 
to assure that surgical residents and staff can meet the 
requirements of certification by their the medical specialty 
boards 
the new regulations are expected to be identical to those 
procedures covered under the civilian health and medical program 
for the uniformed services the insurance program known as champus 
that allows service members and their dependents to receive health 
care in private facilities ms hansen said 
champus doesnt cover purely cosmetic surgery

forget about the thornier negotiations between 
the economic summit partners jackson hicks master caterer knows 
what real pressure is 
pressure is serving lunch to the most powerful leaders in the 
western world no dropped trays no splashy food no hardtoeat 
entrees nothing that might embarrass a president or hinder a 
negotiation or interrupt a profound thought 
ive enjoyed taking care of many important people in my career 
kings queens presidents movie stars businessmen hicks 
said but nothing was more challenging and exciting than taking 
care of those world leaders 
hicks 43 might be considered the man who catered the summit 
his houston company put on 13 meals and parties from a 
5000person media festival to a working lunch for the leaders 
hes averaged less than two hours of sleep a night through the 
summit which ends today with a party to thank houston hosted by 
president bush and catered by hicks 
were used to pressure but this has been a very intense thing 
because of who these people are and because of the short window of 
time hicks said everythings been on scheduled and come off 
without a hitch except for one flat tire on the way to a 
spouses dinner where barbara bush was host 
it hasnt been easy intense security measures especially when 
moving around the rice university campus has doubled preparation 
times hicks said and tuesday his 170 workers served three 
working luncheons at once 
you have to make the food simple not flashy and not 
difficult to eat you want to be unobtrusive they cant carry on 
an important conversation if theyre trying to crack a lobster 
open he said this isnt the time to bring out some flaming 
desert on the shoulders of a team of waiters 
hicks thinks the white house tapped him for the job because of 
his companys reputation and experience hes catered at the 1988 
winter olympics last years super bowl major texas celebrations 
and previous dinners for bush it didnt hurt too that many of 
his regular clients are personal friends of the bush family 
hicks a tall man with gray hair curling to his shoulders was a 
wine buyer for the exclusive neimanmarcus retail chain before 
striking out on his own in 1981 
his cooks bartenders and waiters all worked the same frenzied 
hours as he did they prepared 4000 gulf oysters 562 pounds of 
beef fajitas 1000 bobwhite quail 10000 live crawfish and 200 
pounds of venison sausage 
he wont discuss what his food budget was and until tuesday 
couldnt even tell others he was working on the summit let alone 
what he planned to serve for security reasons 
hicks served lots of grilled beef and chicken and tea 
sandwiches fresh fruits and vegetables were popular with the 
western leaders as were cold menus on hot houston afternoons he 
said 
while the issues on the tables of the rice university meeting 
rooms were intensely argued hicks came away impressed at how 
friendly the leaders seemed to each other 
many of these people have known each other for a long time 
they just seemed relaxed with one another the pictures and 
ceremonies appeared formal but inside they werent formal 
hicks said i was very impressed with the graciousness and warmth 
to one another

central american presidents called for 
foreign support of president violeta barrios de chamorro on tuesday 
as a sandinistaled strike turned managua into a chaos of gunfire 
and roadblocks 
the wave of strikes that began last week has put the heaviest 
pressure yet on the 10weekold usbacked administration 
mrs chamorro called out the army late monday to restore order 
both the army and police are controlled by the leftist sandinistas 
who ruled until april 25 and remain the largest single political 
force in nicaragua 
gunfire died down tuesday morning but by afternoon scattered 
shooting resumed between sandinistas and chamorro supporters who 
included leaders of the disbanded contra rebels 
in once incident one sandinista soldier was shot and wounded 
and another beaten tuesday afternoon outside a radio station being 
used as a headquarters by armed civilians opposed to the general 
strike 
the soldiers were passing by the proadministration radio 
corporation building in eastern managua when they were attacked 
and the wounded soldier was taken to the hospital 
the sandinista opposition blames the contras for the fighting 
which the nicaraguan human rights commission said had clamed four 
lives and left at least 84 people injured sinced the strike began 
on june 26 
the violence began on friday 
the presidents of guatemala el salvador costa rica and 
honduras issued a joint communique tuesday calling on the 
international community to lend its valuable assistance to the 
nicaraguan government in its search for a solution to the crisis it 
is undergoing 
honduran government spokesman martin baide gave the associated 
press a copy of the declaration which he said was being 
simultaneously released in the other central american countries 
asked whether the united states was providing any technical or 
intelligence assistance to mrs chamorro secretary of state james 
a baker iii would not talk about any specifics 
weve been very helpful to mrs chamorro in the past said 
baker speaking at a news conference in houston where he was 
attending the summit of the seven largest industrial democracies 
and it goes without saying that we would want to be helpful in 
securing democracy in nicaragua so we would want to be 
helpful 
sandinista radio stations radio sandino and radio ya charged 
tuesday that contra leaders were directing armed groups of urban 
commandos reporters identified leaders of the contras the rebels 
supported by the united states while the sandinistas were in power 
among the armed groups 
the contras have been turning in their weapons under supervision 
of the united nations and the organization of american states and 
mrs chamorro has declared their nineyear resistance at an end 
police and soldiers tore down roadblocks in managua and cleaned 
up after street bonfires tuesday but strikers still occupied 
government ministries and stateowned businesses in the city of 
about 1 million people 
strike sympathizers built even more roadblocks to replace those 
taken down 
whether the army and police will back mrs chamorros new 
government or let the strike widen is considered crucial in the 
outcome of the walkouts now in their second week 
we mustnt repress the people one policeman said 
the sandinistas lost the presidential election to mrs chamorro 
on feb 25 ending 10 years of revolutionary rule of this country 
of 37 million residents the us economic embargo which helped 
create shortages even in basic foodstuffs contributed to their 
defeat 
mrs chamorro won with the backing of a 14party coalition that 
ranged from far right to communist and had little more in common 
than a distaste for the sandinistas 
the us trade sanctions and a long war against the 
ussupported contra rebels devastated the economy before mrs 
chamorro took office and her reconstruction efforts have stirred 
resentment and opposition 
sandinistaled unions called the strike to protest what they 
said were massive firings of government workers and to demand a 
voice in government economic policy which they say favors the 
wealthy under the new government 
labor leaders say 90000 people are taking part in the strike 
mrs chamorros government declared the action illegal last week 
claiming it was politically motivated 
gunfire spread from eastern managuas workingclass 
neighborhoods to the central section at the offices radio 
corporation the armed civilians who barricaded themselves there 
said they were protecting the station from sandinistas who wanted 
to burn it they said they tended up to 20 wounded in the radio 
station but there had been no deaths 
many prosandinista groups at the roadblocks carry sovietbloc 
ak47 assault rifles standard issue in the sandinista army 
thousands of ak47s were distributed to sandinista sympathizers 
after the february election defeat government demands for return 
of the weapons were largely ignored 
strikers have taken over most government ministries and many 
staterun enterprises the international airport is closed by an 
air controllers strike and water has been cut to parts of the city 
electrical service was restored tuesday but workers said they 
would start selective cuts around the city 
postal workers and telephone operators are on strike leaving 
the relatively few nicaraguans with directdial capacity the only 
ones who can communicate outside the country 
driving was difficult in some areas impossible in others 
because of barricades 
hundreds of factories and businesses shut down monday because 
employees could not get to work 
some walked to their jobs 
i will have to walk several kilometers to my job said marta 
gonzalez a household maid if i dont work i dont eat 
former president daniel ortega said any effort to end the strike 
by force would invite generalized chaos 
he demanded a resumption of negotiations suspended by the 
government over the weekend because it said union leaders wanted to 
discuss political not economic issues

rep harold ford is going after 
prosecutors not politicians as the eightterm congressman runs 
his second reelection campaign under federal indictment 
tennessees only black member of congress democrat ford 
contends he is a victim of justice department lawyers with a taste 
for prosecuting black leaders 
they dont have the funds to investigate the savings and loan 
industry but they have the funds to investigate me twice ford 
said in an interview im going to put the prosecutors on trial 
during this campaign 
ford was indicted on bank and mail fraud charges in 1987 and was 
on trial for 11 weeks in us district court in memphis a mistrial 
was declared in april when jurors said they were unable to reach a 
verdict 
prosecutors say a second trial will be held but no date has been 
set 
ford and his backers liken his legal troubles to government 
investigations of washington mayor marion barry rep william gray 
dpa new york mayor david dinkins and other prominent black 
politicians 
benjamin hooks executive director of the national association 
for the advancement of colored people has taken up that argument 
on fords behalf as has jesse jackson 
its not just these leaders on trial jackson said at a 
recent rally in memphis its the justice department on trial 
ford 45 is a strong favorite for reelection he faces state 
rep pam gaia and perennial candidate mark flanagan in the aug 2 
democratic primary 
aaron davis a 79yearold political newcomer will represent 
the republicans in november isaac richmond an independent ford 
already has defeated several times also is running 
ford said his legal troubles have done little to undermine his 
political standing but the financial and emotional toll has been 
high 
they wont be able to hurt me politically but financially 
this has been a drain he said its been very difficult 
ford is accused of taking payoffs disguised as loans from former 
bankers jake and ch butcher jr who in 1983 set off the largest 
banking collapse in tennessee history 
ford said he expects his legal expenses to approach 2 million 
since his indictment ford has used about 350000 in political 
contributions for his legal defense campaign records show ford 
also has raised more than 380000 through a legal defense fund 
called trust ford 
the republicans have not made a serious run for fords seat 
since 1976 when he defeated a popular city councilman with 61 
percent of the vote 
in 1988 while under indictment he drew no republican 
opposition and collected 80 percent of the vote in the democratic 
primary and in the general election 
ford is the most prominent member of a large family that has 
long been active in memphis politics his brother john is a state 
senator who also is running this year for county tax collector 
another brother james is a city councilman 
ford directs a political organization that can turn out the vote 
on election day many of his followers especially those who are 
poor and black are fiercely loyal 
his complaints of justice department bias will play well with 
the voters said the rev samuel kyles a ford supporter and 
longtime memphis civil rights leader 
theyll respond to it because it is so clear kyles said 
fords district which includes most of memphis is 58 percent 
black black registered voters slightly outnumber whites citywide 
a champion of traditional democratic causes ford has a 
reputation for helping constituents with their personal problems 
whether they are dealing with federal agencies or local government 
ford who was indicted in knoxville in primarily white eastern 
tennessee claims he was judicially kidnapped he says he would 
not have been charged by a grand jury in memphis 
prosecutors contend ford has so inflamed his followers that 
finding an impartial jury for a second trial may be impossible 
unless it is moved out of memphis 
ford is widely considered a likely candidate for mayor of 
memphis if he can get the bank fraud indictment behind him he says 
he was preparing to announce a bid for mayor when he was indicted

tatana maresova has sworn off meat 
as long as she is breastfeeding 
from the newspapers now free of censorship she knows meat is 
often contaminated with harmful substances 
emissions from chemical plants coalburning industry and 
twocylinder cars guzzling a mixture of oil and gasoline have 
polluted the air made much of the countrys water unfit to drink 
and seeped into the food chain 
heavy industry was the measure of success during communism rule 
when leaders did not concern themselves with environmental 
protection czechoslovakia has soem of the worst environmental 
damage in the east bloc 
marcela peskova worries about the storebought milk she gives 
her two daughters 
i know they get pollutants but without it they couldnt 
grow she says casting an anxious glance at kristina 5 and 
pavlina 4 
both mothers routinely boil the water their family drinks and 
try to buy bottled mineral water for the babies 
more than 50 percent of the water is not suitable for 
drinking says josef vavrousek the man in charge of 
environmental matters in the new government more than half the 
population is drinking damaging water 
vavrousek is trying to assess the damage caused by heavy 
industry and devise a viable program for solving environmental 
problems 
how long could that take 
i think all my life he says only half joking but he 
believes it is possible to make very important improvements in 
two three or five years 
the first freely elected government in four decades has been 
dubbed the government of national sacrifice by president vaclav 
havel while it wants to clean up the environment it also has the 
unpopular task of closing down moneylosing industry and making the 
economy more responsive to the laws of supply and demand 
if the economy is not improved the environment cant be 
either vavrousek said 
for the mothers raising their children in polluted prague or the 
heavily industrialized regions of northern bohemia and moravia 
pollution is a fact of life 
the lidova demokracie daily recently quoted experts as saying 
the milk of women between 18 and 34 is contaminated by pcbs ddt 
and other toxic materials 
the newspaper quoted a veterinarian as saying that under the 
communists experts had tried to inform the government about pcb 
contamination of meat but the problems were disregarded 
in the health field a reevaluation is under way now that the 
communists are out 
everything is in a state of upheaval said dr alena chyska 
head of the department for the care and development of the new 
generation in the health ministry 
ms chyska said birth defects and other health problems appeared 
more common in heavily polluted areas where children were also 
more likely to contract respiratoryrelated illnesses and allergies 
until conditions improve residents of prague and other polluted 
areas must rely largely on their own resources to protect their 
health 
if i had money i would buy a country place said ms 
peskova 
ms maresova is luckier 
her parents live in the countryside her 6monthold baby michal 
was born with respiratory problems but his health improved after 
several months at her parents place in the mountains in slovakia 
her parents now raise vegetables in their garden with the 
baby we need uncontaminated food maresova explained as her 
7yearold son tomas fidgeted next to her on the park bench 
did she miss taking some precautions with her firstborn because 
media discussion of enviromental problems was taboo under the 
communists 
when my first child was growing up really important 
information seemed to seep through she says 
vavrouseks no 1 priority is to improve the quality of water 
and food first of all seeing that there is a good distribution of 
bottled water 
but muzzling sulphurbelching factories with filters wont be 
easy it is costly and requires technology not available in 
czechoslovakia 
plenty of western companies have offered to help plug the 
pollution hemorrhage 
weve gotten hundreds of offers vavrousek said in an 
interview in the offices he has occupied for just eight weeks 
but we have two problems we dont have the experience to 
decipher the options or the money to buy it

savings and loan bailout officials are 
shifting strategy and trying to save taxpayers money by closing 
troubled thrifts just before rather than after the institutions 
fail 
the board of the resolution trust corp voted 40 tuesday to 
adopt the accelerated resolutions program it will become the 
preferred course of action for handling failing thrifts rtc 
chairman l william seidman said 
officials estimate they could use the program for between 155 
and 180 of the 260 sampls expected to fail over the next year they 
plan to see how it works with 10 institutions over the summer 
previously the trust corporations tactic has been to seize an 
insolvent institution appoint a government managing agent to rein 
in any highflying practices and sell the sampl to whoever offers to 
accept the least amount of government aid 
the problem is that the last step was coming months sometimes 
more than a year after the initial seizure in the meantime 
longtime depositors and key employees were fleeing the institution 
reducing its value as an ongoing business 
under the new program the agency hopes it will be able to spend 
fewer taxpayer dollars by finding a buyer before an institution is 
stigmatized as failed the method is similar to how the federal 
deposit insurance corp handles commercial banks in trouble 
rather than publicly advertise for bids the rtc will solicit 
proposals for stillopen but weak sampls from a list of about 3500 
investors who have expressed an interest in acquiring failed 
institutions 
when a buyer is selected the institution will be closed and 
immediately reopened relieving the new owners of legal claims 
against the old institution 
the old shareholders will lose their investment the old 
managers will keep or lose their jobs depending on whether they 
played a part in causing the institution to fail 
generally if no buyer is found within 90 days the institution 
will be seized by the government 
this is a program designed to sell institutions in the most 
efficient and quickest manner possible with the least possible 
deterioration in value seidman said 
private analysts cautiously endorsed the strategy although they 
noted that the rtc has yet to deal with nearly 250 institutions 
that failed previously it has handled more than 200 failed thrifts 
in its first 11 months 
i think in principle its a good idea the only question is 
whether they are so overloaded now with all the clearly insolvent 
institutions said robert litan of the brookings institution a 
liberaloriented washington think tank 
youre going to be using scarce resources for marginally 
insolvent thrifts ahead of other institutions that are clearly in 
much worse shape he said 
however litan said taxpayers might save money by bailing out an 
institution on the edge of insolvency when its owners may be most 
tempted to gamble a deeply insolvent sampl under government control 
often is not in danger of further deterioration he said 
if youre in the government the thing to do is not to focus 
on past losses but to focus on how to prevent future losses from 
occurring he said 
auburn university economist james barth said the program might 
be a better way of handling the loans real estate and other assets 
of a failed thrift 
in the conventional sampl bailouts so far the government has been 
stuck with about half of the assets which it hopes to sell later 
officials hope that in accelerated resolution deals the new owner 
rather than the government will get most of the assets 
the rtc has so many assets it has to try new and different 
things to get those assets back into the private sector barth 
said if theyre not careful theyre going to wind up with the 
worlds largest troubled savings and loan and its going to be 
called the resolution trust corp

new jersey sen bill bradley is mixing policy 
with politics in a new tv campaign ad that encourages people to 
pick up the phone and let the democratic candidate know where they 
stand 
political consultants say the ad which began running this week 
is a smart way to get constituents involved and could help the 
twoterm democrat identify potential donors to be solicited for 
campaign contributions 
the ad running on cable television in new jersey invites 
viewers to call a tollfree number to register their views on 
bradleys proposal to ban leaded gasoline or to request a brochure 
on the dangers of lead poisoning 
democratic consultant gary nordlinger said constituents who call 
the number and leave their names and addresses could be added to a 
fundraising file for the senators reelection id 
during the 30second commercial bradley doesnt appeal for 
votes or money only for opinions on his proposed lead ban act of 
1990 
in the ad bradley is seated in a kitchen and tells viewers 
an alarming number of children all over new jersey have high 
levels of toxic lead in their blood i first recognized this was a 
serious health hazard when i wrote the law to ban the use of lead 
in new drinking water systems 
now i think we should ban the sale of leaded gasoline 
immediately what do you think should we 
viewers are invited to call an 800number to register support or 
opposition to the proposed ban by pushing the appropriate number on 
their phone opponents and supporters alike are asked to leave 
mailing information on the tape if they want a brochure on lead 
poisoning 
gop political consultant jim weber called the ad a smart 
tactic that allows the incumbent senator to make a smooth 
transition into campaign activity 
the ad could attract support from ticket splitters and middle 
of the road folks weber said 
its an interactive measure which to me is quite clever 
said democratic consultant peter hart 
bradley aides said the ad was not designed with fundraising in 
mind the senator is heavily favored for reelection and has raised 
more than 101 million 
we have no plans to use this information to generate money 
said campaign spokesman bob mchugh what this is about is 
protecting kids in new jersey 
bradleys gop opponent christine todd whitman called the ad 
and accompanying brochure a selfpromotional gimmick 
bill bradleys attempt to promote awareness of this issue is 
sleight of hand at best and manipulation at its worst she said

the gathering and message at mitch snyders 
funeral were like those that marked his life a mass of homeless 
people with a few celebrities sprinkled in all getting a hefty 
dose of social gospel 
mitch loved the poor with an unquenchable and sustained 
fire antiwar priest phillip berrigan said tuesday of the 
militant advocate for the homeless now all of us must do as 
mitch did work to end injustice 
snyder 46 was found hanged last week in the shelter he helped 
create an apparent suicide a note found nearby spoke of problems 
in his relationship with his longtime companion carol fennelly 
but the celebrities politicians and activists who remembered 
him before 3000 people at a tearful twohour outdoor funeral 
chose to concentrate on his commitment to the downtrodden and his 
political activism 
he found people to be beautiful and worthwhile that everybody 
else seems to have written off said singeractress cher who 
spent several holidays serving food at feasts for the homeless 
organized by snyder it must truly be love thy neighbor as 
thyself and mitch lived that 
he leaves us here to tell the story that americas dream is 
incomplete civil rights leader jesse jackson said in a eulogy 
until the hungry are fed and the homeless are housed we will 
not surrender the work continues 
snyder was cremated after the services outside his 1200bed 
shelter and a protest march to washingtons city hall behind the 
horsedrawn carriage bearing his casket 
his remains will be kept inside the shelter along with the ashes 
of homeless people many of them anonymous who died on the streets 
of the capitals 
at the government building snyders followers from the 
community for creative nonviolence blocked doors to protest the 
city councils decision last month to scale back a law guaranteeing 
shelter to all who need it thirtyseven people were charged with 
unlawful entry and released without bail police said 
snyder was a politician he lived it he dressed it said 
fennelly his companion and shelter cofounder for those of you 
here today who are a little uncomfortable with the political aspect 
that was mitch 
speakers at the service played down snyders personal problems 
how he died really does not matter jackson said how 
he lived is all that matters he left on his terms an authentic 
suffering servant 
we get weak sometimes and we blame it on our friends the ones 
we love said comedian and social activist dick gregory every 
now and then us men get weak moments sometimes we make it through 
and sometimes we dont 
mayor marion barry often the target of snyders criticism over 
spending on the homeless said some try to figure out how mitch 
died why mitch died id rather concentrate on how mitch lived 
actor martin sheen who played snyder in a television movie 
about snyders 1984 hunger strike that gained the downtown shelter 
building said snyder embodied one of the favorite sayings of 
robert kennedy that one man with courage is a majority

summit leaders struggled to break a deadlock in a 
useuropean fight over billions of dollars in farm subsidies with 
indications early wednesday morning that negotiators were closing 
in on a possible agreement 
officials close to the negotiations who spoke on conditition 
that they not be named said the language being discussed would 
provide for cuts in farm subsidies in each of the three areas 
singled out by the united states 
the language being considered would call for substantial 
progressive reductions in subsidies in the areas of export 
subsidies internal price supports and barriers to imports 
the united states had insisted that all three areas be covered 
in an agreement a position that had been opposed by the european 
community 
however the draft language also made reference to the european 
communitys more general approach which would measure a countrys 
total trade subsidies and then work to reduce that level thus 
giving each side bargaining space in upcoming talks later this 
month in geneva 
one source said that while this was the language being 
considered for inclusion in the final communique to be read by 
president bush later wednesday negotiators had by no means 
resolved the issue 
they are going through the proposal line by line the source 
said there is still much time left in the evening 
before the trade negotiators began their late night discussions 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said it was uncertain 
whether the united states would achieve its goal of language 
committing countries to acrosstheboard reductions 
the farm subsidy question is still an open one fitzwater 
said 
the dispute over farm subsidies and to a lesser extent 
discussion over soviet aid required the leaders to spend an extra 
90 minutes in their afternoon meeting in addition to bush leaders 
from britain japan west germany canada france italy and a 
representative from the european community were participating in 
the talks 
if the economic summit fails to achieve strong language on the 
farm subsidy issue it would be a significant setback for the bush 
administration which sees resolution of the issue as critical to 
getting global trade talks back on track 
while the united states for three years has been trying to get a 
commitment to eliminate the 245 billion rich countries spend to 
subsidize farmers the european community has been opposed 
contending that 3 million of its farmers could lose their jobs 
the 12 nations of the ec have a total of 10 million farmers 
compared with 2 million in the united states 
the european community has insisted that it was willing to 
reduce the aggregate total of farm subsidies but did not want to 
commit to cutbacks in each separate area sought by the united 
states 
british prime minister margaret thatcher submitted a compromise 
proposal in an effort to bridge the gap but it was rejected by the 
united states as unacceptable officials said even though it 
attracted considerable support from other european countries 
britain which has few smallscale farmers is the most willing 
of the europeans to compromise with the united states and sought to 
mediate in the summit talks 
treasury secretary nicholas brady said the delegations would 
continue discussing the farm dispute late into the night he 
described the debate on agriculture as a vigorous discussion 
among all the countries involved 
president bushs battle to eliminate farm subsidies worldwide 
over the next decade had appeared to receive a boost on monday when 
west german chancellor helmut kohl signaled his willingness to 
accept a usbacked proposal as a starting point for negotiations 
us officials expressed hope that remaining differences could 
be resolved so that the summit countries would be able to give 
guidance to their trade negotiators in geneva 
resolving the farm question is seen as critical to successful 
completion of a nearly fouryear effort to overhaul the global 
trading system that effort known as the uruguay round for the 
country where the talks were launched is being conducted by the 
97nation general agreement on tariffs and trade 
the united states which has posted six consecutive years of 
trade deficits topping 100 billion has a lot riding on the effort 
by removing trade barriers the administration believes a new 
gatt pact would greatly expand export opportunities for american 
businesses and farmers thus lowering the us trade deficit 
the basis for possible compromise in houston revolved around a 
recent outline for a final agreement issued by aart de zeeuw of the 
netherlands the chairman of the gatt agricultural negotiating 
group that proposal calls for significant reductions in subsidies 
for exports in domestic support payments to farmers and the 
removal of barriers to agricultural imports 
west german chancellor helmut kohl expressed support for the de 
zeeuw proposal on monday giving hope to the americans that they 
might be able to convince other european countries to compromise on 
the issue 
but european community officials who have been lobbied hard by 
americans in houston said that while kohls comments were 
significant they did not mean that the other 11 ec countries would 
go along the issue of what position to take was certain to be 
discussed next monday at a meeting of the communitys foreign 
ministers in brussels 
bush had declared that the trade issue was his top priority 
going into the annual economic summit and he argued the point 
forcefully during private oneonone meetings as well as the group 
sessions with his summit partners 
the administration pressed the point that the best thing the 
worlds richest countries could do for the developing world was 
expand trade opportunities especially in agriculture the chief 
export in most of the developing world 
developing countries now lose billions of dollars in sales each 
year because of 245 billion being spent annually to subsidize 
farmers by rich countries us subsidies cost taxpayers and 
consumers 75 billion annually 
the administration believes it can persuade congress to 
eliminate the farm supports over time if other countries do so as 
well since us farmers are among the most efficient in the world 
congress is currently considering a 1990 farm bill which would 
continue americas farm subsidies 
asked tuesday if lawmakers might be willing to cut the subsidies 
if the houston summit reaches agreement on the issue house speaker 
thomas s foley dwash said it is unlikely that congress 
would develop a farm program based on some future circumstance that 
has certainly not yet arrived or not expected to arrive

fbi director william s sessions took his wife 
on 17 business trips aboard government aircraft but she paid for 
only one flight according to a congressional study 
the general accounting office said its survey of trips aboard 
government aircraft by sessions and attorney general dick 
thornburgh underscores the need for a travel policy covering 
federal officials and their spouses 
we continue to believe that a governmentwide policy is needed 
to clarify under what circumstances spouses should be permitted to 
accompany government officials to official functions aboard 
government aircraft said the gao report issued tuesday 
the study of 39 trips aboard government aircraft by thornburgh 
and 36 by sessions between aug 11 1988 and july 31 1989 was 
requested by rep bob wise dwva 
it found that alice sessions accompanied her husband on 17 trips 
to such destinations as san francisco new orleans key west fla 
and williamsburg va 
fbi spokesman robert davenport said mrs sessions did not pay 
for the flights except one because her husband was traveling on 
official business mrs sessions paid 280 for one flight when the 
couple extended a trip to take care of personal business in san 
antonio texas davenport said 
thornburghs wife ginny accompanied her husband on six 
official trips during the period surveyed in april five months 
after the gao began its inquiry thornburgh reimbursed the justice 
department 2128 to cover the six trips plus two others she took 
on government aircraft 
justice department spokesman dan eramian said mrs thornburgh 
was not required to pay for her flights but did so out of an 
abundance of caution 
thornburgh also paid the government 1032 to cover personal 
trips that he and his family took aboard the aircraft which were 
seized from convicted criminals 
gao did not question the propriety of the trips but said the 
government should examine its travel policy to determine when it is 
appropriate for officials to take their spouses on official 
business 
the government should consider what constitutes an official 
purpose or official function and when its appropriate for 
spouses to fly for free gao said 
in a letter to the justice department wise criticized the 
agency for its failure to adopt a travel policy after it had 
assured him last fall that one was being drafted 
eramian said a policy will be adopted adding it would have 
been silly to put something together until we saw what the gao 
recommendations were 
the gao also said the justice department failed to compare the 
cost of using the seized aircraft to transport sessions and 
thornburgh with the cost of leasing private aircraft 
the watchdog arm of congress acknowledged that the justice 
department had legitimate concerns about the security of thornburgh 
and sessions 
but gao said our analysis indicates that private aircraft 
services available through lease charter or rental arrangements 
could satisfy the principal security and related concerns better 
than regularly scheduled airlines 
the justice department did its own analysis after the gao study 
began and concluded that it was saving 500000 a year by using 
seized aircraft instead of leasing commercial planes 
if we had leased an aircraft and spent an extra half million a 
year we would have received a larger dose of criticism eramian 
said

a recordsetting fraud settlement by a major 
government contractor means a 27 million windfall for the 
helicopter company employee who blew the whistle 
robert c ballew 43 of fort worth texas sounded like a 
lottery winner after the justice department announced tuesday that 
textron lycoming agreed to pay the government 179 million 
the settlement is the largest ever reached under the justice 
departments whistleblower lawsuit program 
the payment to the government which has already been made 
settles a fraud investigation focusing on the stratford 
connbased companys problemplagued coast guard helicopter 
engines it translates into a 27 million windfall for ballew 15 
percent of the total 
i think anybody would be happy to have the money ballew 
said ive still got a lot of bills to pay kids to send to 
school i could sure use the money 
ballew was a procurement official with aerospatiale helicopter 
corp a french firm that makes the coast guards dolphin 
helicopter when the problems with the engines turned up he said 
he decided to sue in may 1988 when he became concerned that he 
could be jailed because of the chronic engine problems it was a 
decision that cost him his job 
we tried to get the problem cured where i worked he said 
it seems like they couldnt do enough when that happened it put 
me in risk of going to jail 
textron was under investigation for providing engines that 
failed to meet their operating specifications and for fraudulently 
billing the coast guard for repair work according to the justice 
department the twinengine helicopters are used in 
searchandrescue and drug interdiction missions 
former coast guard commandant paul yost once referred to the 
engine as a lemon 
a separate investigation by the national transportation safety 
board turned up 154 failures of the lts101 engine 
manufactured by textrons lycoming williamsport pa plant an 
ntsb computer list indicated that at least 11 deaths may have been 
directly related to engine failure and published reports have 
placed the estimate as high as 14 
the justice departments whistleblower lawsuit program 
encourages individuals with inside information to sue when fraud or 
other abuses appear likely if the evidence is promising as it was 
in this case the government then takes over the case and 
guarantees the whistleblower a percentage of any settlement 
ballew sued both textron and his own company aerospatiale later 
was dropped from the investigation for lack of evidence according 
to the justice department 
investigators said textron supplied the coast guard an engine 
that was in the shop after an average of only 600 hours of flying 
time specifications called for the engine to put in 2400 hours in 
the air between overhauls 
textron issued a statement admitting no wrongdoing but saying it 
planned to provide a thorough maintenance program and already had 
made improvements in the engine 
textron also agreed to maintain the engines and supply parts for 
the next six years and be paid a fee based on the engine flying 
time that provision could save the coast guard an estimated 60 
million according to the justice department 
ballew said he was laid off after filing the suit and has found 
another job in the aerospace industry he declined to name his new 
employer 
does ballew have plans to spend his fortune 
what i intend to do is quietly sit at home with my wife and 
kids he said the settlement he said says that maybe my 
judgment wasnt flawed that what i saw what i have been trained 
to check for and ask questions about was right

senate employees would get comprehensive 
guarantees against job discrimination for the first time under a 
measure approved by the senate as it launched its debate on a major 
civil rights bill 
but the plan added to the bill tuesday would stop short of 
allowing senate employees to go to court for enforcement of their 
rights prompting complaints that it was out of keeping with the 
spirit of civil rights 
its an appeal to the worst of plantation mentality on capitol 
hill sen charles grassley riowa said in urging a stronger 
version 
senate employees have traditionally been exempted from 
fairhiring and other civil rights guarantees 
the senate itself would handle civil rights complaints from its 
employees under the plan sponsored by sen wendell ford dky but 
it would guarantee them rights under three laws passed over the 
last 25 years and two currently pending including the bill now 
under debate 
provisions of the bill which tops the congressional agenda of 
civil rights forces range from a ban on racial harassment in the 
workplace to a prohibition against discriminatory seniority systems 
the bush administration however has been sharply critical of a 
provision that would force employers either to end discriminatory 
practices or prove in court that they were justified by business 
necessity 
the provision would effectively negate a supreme court ruling 
last year in a case involving hiring practices at a salmon cannery 
in alaska the court held that anyone filing such a suit must prove 
that the discriminatory practice in question was not a business 
necessity 
critics of the bill say its socalled disparate impact 
provisions responding to the ruling would prompt employers to use 
racial and ethnic hiring quotas to head off lawsuits 
administration officials and sen edward m kennedy dmass 
the bills chief sponsor have been searching for a compromise that 
would spare president bush having to veto a civil rights bill and 
give supporters some of their goals 
the negotiations have turned into a fight over shadings of legal 
definitions and no visible progress was made tuesday 
white house chief of staff john h sununu said in a letter to 
kennedy basically i continue to fear language that causes more 
problems than it solves or language with unintended consequences 
that would stimulate a quotabased defensive position 
kennedy issued a statement saying that negotiations are 
continuing but so far the administrations proposals have not been 
satisfactory 
last years decisions by the supreme court have seriously 
jeopardized the right of millions of women and minorities to equal 
job opportunity he said congress should restore the full 
strength of the antidiscrimination law not restore them only part 
way 
earlier kennedy unveiled a fresh compromise proposal saying it 
is a mockery of civil rights for opponents of this 
legislation to raise the false hue and cry of quotas 
but sen orrin hatch rutah said the plan would force 
business people to proportionately hire just to save their skins 
and avoid lawsuits 
the latest round of modifications were refinements of highly 
technical language in the bill for example the revised version 
would force those filing suits to single out specific objectionable 
practices rather than target groups of practices 
the new version would change the definition of business 
necessity from essential to effective job performance to 
bears a substantial and demonstrable relationship to effective 
job performance

aids is rapidly rising through the ranks of 
killers of american women of childbearing age and by next year will 
probably be the fifth leading cause of death among them scientists 
reported today 
the aids death rate is dramatically higher among young black 
women than whites and the disease is far more prevalent in the 
northeast than in other regions the scientists said in the journal 
of the american medical association 
aids already claims more black women ages 15 to 44 in new york 
state and new jersey than any other health problem wrote the 
researchers at the federal centers for disease control 
weve known how serious the problem is in new jersey 
christine grand deputy state health commissioner said by 
telephone tuesday from trenton however even those working in 
the field are shocked to see how high the standing is visavis all 
causes of death 
nationwide among women ages 15 to 44 deaths from aids soared 
from 18 in 1980 to 1430 in 1988 the most recent year for which 
statistics are available the researchers said 
the death rate quadrupled between 1985 and 1988 when aids 
accounted for 3 percent of all deaths of women in that age group 
the researchers said 
the report elaborates on cdc findings released in november 
indicating aids had become the eighth leading cause of death among 
american women of childbearing age 
among all us women ages 15 to 44 the leading causes of death 
are in order cancer injuries heart disease homicide suicide 
strokes and related diseases liver disease aids diabetes flu 
and pneumonia 
if current trends continue aids can be expected to become one 
of the five leading causes of death by 1991 among women of 
childbearing age the researchers said 
because women who have the aids virus are the major source of 
infection for infants the trends portend disaster for thousands of 
children cdc researchers wrote 
as the number of pediatric cases increases the medical and 
social costs will be staggering the report said each baby born 
in poverty who is infected with the virus costs medicaid 18000 to 
42000 annually it said 
the disease killed 407 black women per 100000 in new jersey 
and 295 per 100000 in new york in 1987 the most recent year for 
which regional statistics are available said lead author susan y 
chu a cdc epidemiologist 
that to me is remarkable because it exceeds the rates of 
heart disease and cancer as well as accidents she said by 
telephone from atlanta 
among all women the aids death rates were 94 per 100000 in 
new jersey and 93 per 100000 in new york nationally the death 
rate for black women 103 per 100000 was nine times the death 
rate for white women the researchers said 
regionally women in the northeast overall died of aids at a 
rate of 53 per 100000 population 26 times the rate in the 
midwest the researchers said 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer 
threequarters of women with aidsvirus infections get them from 
using intravenous drugs or having sex with intravenous drug users 
ms chu said 
in 1989 there were 2825 new cases of aids among women of 
reproductive age the researchers said 
dr howard minkoff professor of obstetrics and gynecology at 
the state university of new york health science center at brooklyn 
said the findings are overwhelming and worrisome 
even more troubling he said in a telephone interview is the 
attitude of white middleclass americans whose reaction to such 
reports is its still not us 
minkoff said 2000 women infected with the aids virus will bear 
infected babies in the united states this year

the last us ambassador to cambodia 
john gunther dean said today he plans to return to phnom penh to 
help heal the wounds of 20 years of conflict 
dean now retired from government service was ambassador when 
the khmer rouge defeated the usbacked phnom penh government in 
1975 vietnam drop the khmer rouge from power in late 1978 and 
installed a prohanoi regime 
clutching an american flag dean and his staff were evacuated by 
helicopters april 12 1975 as the khmer rouge closed in on the 
capital 
dean who is to fly to phnom penh on thursday and stay about a 
week said he would try to arrange a thai educational exchange and 
look into the possibility of hotel construction by an indian 
company to promote tourism 
what i can do is to help cambodia and the people of cambodia 
find ways to bring them out of isolation and into cooperation with 
the rest of the world dean said in an interview

the american red cross disputes a report that 
it improperly failed to report on aids cases possibly transmitted 
through blood transfusions and federal authorities acknowledge 
there is no such reporting requirement 
red cross spokesman bud good responded tuesday in a prepared 
statement to a report that the red cross failed to notify federal 
authorities about 228 cases in which patients may have gotten aids 
through contaminated blood transfusions 
the red cross has not failed to comply with fda requirements 
to report transfusionassociated aids cases for the simple reason 
that there are no such requirements good said 
a lowlevel fda report on an inspection of red cross national 
headquarters in washington between april 26 and may 25 found that 
none of the cases had been reported to the agency as required 
but top fda officials acknowledged tuesday that the inspection 
report which was disclosed in tuesdays editions of the 
philadelphia inquirer was incorrect and that there is no federal 
requirement for the red cross to report possible 
transfusionrelated aids cases to the fda 
physicians are supposed to report aids cases to the federal 
centers of disease control 
the lowerlevel fda inspection report that started the flap said 
the red cross lacks procedures for reviewing and tracking 
transfusion associated aids cases 
fda headquarters said in a statement late in the day that the 
agency will pursue these matters and work to remedy any 
problems raised by the inspection report 
however the fda said it had reviewed about 50 of the most 
recent 228 cases of possible transfusionrelated aids and found 
that nearly all involved transfusions before aids antibody testing 
began in 1985 
in the course of the inspection there was no evidence that 
any blood that tested positive after 1985 was improperly 
released the fda said 
the fda also said that past recordkeeping problems of the red 
cross do not show an imminent hazard to the blood supply

a television reporter who spent two weeks in 
jail for refusing to reveal a confidential source says he will 
return to the police beat a more informed journalist 
brian karem was freed tuesday after the source released him from 
his vow of confidentiality 
the first amendment is first for a reason karem said 
its been an eyeopener 
karem 29 who works for kmoltv was held in contempt of court 
and sentenced to six months in jail for refusing to identify who 
helped him obtain a telephone interview last year with jailed 
murder defendant henry david hernandez who told karem he shot 
police officer gary williams in self defense in march 1989 
attorneys in the case said they needed to know who arranged the 
interview to determine whether it was admissible as evidence 
hernandez is charged with his brother julian in the shooting 
karem lost two us supreme court bids to remain free while he 
appealed the contemptofcourt citation 
karem testified tuesday that his confidential source is deborah 
ledesma a cousin of the hernandez brothers ms ledesma on monday 
night released karem from his promise of confidentiality which he 
said he made because the woman feared hernandez family members 
state district judge pat priest sent karem to jail but released 
him after karem handed over notes identifying ms ledesma 
karem kmoltv officials and their attorney larry macon said 
lawyers in the hernandez case were using karem 
weve maintained from the beginning that this was unnecessary 
and the information was readily available to investigators if they 
just asked they didnt need to use a reporter as the investigative 
tool kmoltv news director ron harig said 
beth taylor an assistant district attorney said it was 
necessary to pinpoint karems contact and said his not revealing 
the name was a waste of time 
asked what was most difficult about jail karem joked wearing 
the bexar county underwear i tell you thats not fun 
karem who planned to take off the rest of the week and spend it 
with his wife pam 29 and their 18monthold son zachary said he 
would go through the experience again to keep a promise to a source 
i didnt intend to prove anything i just intended to keep my 
promise so i kept my promise karem said 
karem said support from fellow journalists helped keep his 
spirits high when he was in jail 
i cant even describe all the emotions i had when i saw the 
support that i got he said 
a graduate of the university of missouri journalism school 
karem became a reporter in 1982 he went to work for kmoltv in 
1988 after working for newspapers and television stations in the 
midwest and texas

its peak wildfire season in alaska 
but thats not necessarily a bad thing for some remote villages 
where jobs are scarce 
in some villages firefighting is the single most important 
source of income in a year said pete buist spokesman for a 
fairbanks fire station 
more than 200 wildfires have ravaged a halfmillion acres of 
interior alaska this fire season which began in late june and 
could run into september 
theres no economy in the villages said ron silas a former 
firefighter fires are quick income its cash that supplements 
hunting and fishing 
alaska has more than 70 firefighting crews with 16 members each 
most from villages the firefighters go through at least three days 
of training to learn such things as how to operate a chain saw 
work a water pump and build fire lines 
some years they dont all get to work but this year 
everybody who wants to is working buist said 
the federal government calls fire crews to work those who have 
been out of work the longest are called first he said crews from 
outside alaska are called only when needed 
about 2500 firefighters from across the united states were on 
fire lines in alaska on tuesday 
a work crew can earn 2500 a day or more they take that 
money right home to the local economy said russ davis who 
represents one of several federal firefighting teams flown to 
alaska to help with a 41000acre fire that threatened the town of 
tok 275 miles northeast of anchorage 
firefighters earn 1143 an hour and work as many as 16 hours a 
day for up to three weeks at a time davis said crews are provided 
sleeping bags and meals at state and federal expense 
permanent jobs in rural alaska are scarce said frank starbuck 
a fire crew leader from the inupiat eskimo village of selawik a 
village of 680 residents just above the arctic circle 375 miles 
northwest of fairbanks 
firefighting is very important to selawik most guys depend on 
it during the summer starbuck said 
he led one of two selawik crews that spent five days this week 
fighting a blaze at pedro dome about 15 miles north of fairbanks 
the fire charred 900 acres before it was brought under control 
monday night 
for many rural alaskans fire is a mixed blessing 
i hate to see everything burn up the timber and the 
wildlife they have their young ones now and i feel bad about 
that said molly galbreath an athabaskan indian from the eastern 
interior village of mentasta thats where we get our food 
but before the fire galbreath 57 had a hard time finding 
work she now earns 9 an hour helping out at the bureau of land 
managements fire station in tok 
this will really help for the long winter she said

a senior police official says the 
mandatory death sentence for convicted drug traffickers made law 
six years ago has not deterred smugglers and that such sentences 
should be carried out more quickly 
despite the harsh penalty the number of people arrested for 
drug trafficking has instead risen a newspaper quoted acting 
senior assistant commissioner mohamed said awang as saying 
the people who undertake these suicide tasks drug 
trafficking are only mercenaries who are easily replaced the 
new straits times quoted him as telling a conference on drug 
treatment 
the impact of the mandatory death sentence on the traffickers 
has been diluted because of those arrested only a few have been 
convicted said mohamed 
of the 3340 people detained under that law since 1983 only 
1130 were charged in court of these only 197 were found guilty 
he said 
other government officials have said that since 1975 when a law 
was enacted specifying life imprisonment or the death sentence for 
convicted traffickers 340 were sentenced to death and 112 of them 
hanged 
the others are awaiting appeals or execution dates 
in 1983 the law was changed by parliament to death sentence 
only 
mohamed said that to make that law more effective hanging should 
be carried out as soon as possible 
he said there is a current lapse of between two and six years 
from sentencing to execution

with a musical twist 
when the sun goes down two physicians a nurse and a former 
receptionist turn into the rock n roll band dr mark and the 
sutures 
several times a year the sutures go out in their hospitalgreen 
scrub suits and play their favorite beatles tunes they donate 
their performances for charitable causes 
doctors and rock music its like wearing tennis shoes with a 
tuxedo said band founder dr mark hill 
theres not a great amount of levity in medicine so when 
patients see us in this role theyre shocked said the surgeon 
from suburban highland park 
its a mission that started on a lark 
three years ago hill agreed to come up with entertainment for a 
neighborhood block party hill who paid his way through medical 
school working as a musician called on a fellow doctor at highland 
park hospital a patient and others he knew who also had music as a 
hobby 
for backup singers they eventually added a nurse from the 
hospitals obstetrics and gynecology department a former 
receptionist from hills office and a couple of friends from 
outside the medical community 
hill 39 plays guitar and keyboard and dr ricky katz a 
34yearold internist plays guitar the backup singers are nurse 
patricia handler 32 and 27yearold vickie tarbis the former 
receptionist who since has become an airline stewardess 
we meant this as a joke hill said but there was a huge 
huge crowd at the block party people started coming up to me and 
calling me and asking me to do shows 
the sutures have played performances to raise money for a 
nursery school organizations that help the handicapped and other 
community groups 
were seven people who have lives with our families and have 
professional careers which take number one priority hill said 
but we do this because we enjoy music and because we can help out

the dollar plunged against the japanese yen 
wednesday while share prices rose moderately 
the dollar closed at 14810 yen down 150 yen from tuesdays 
close of 14960 yen it opened at 14842 yen the lowest opening 
since feb 27 and ranged between 14765 yen and 14875 yen 
the benchmark nikkei stock average for 225 selected issues 
gained 14175 points or 044 percent closing at 3229418 the 
index shed 38585 points the previous day 
foreign exchange dealers said the dollar was low on a decline 
overnight in new york and renewed speculation that the bank of 
japan would soon raise its discount rate 
the yen firmed after a washingtonbased investment advisory firm 
smick medley international predicted japans central bank would 
raise its key rate for loans to commercial banks within the next 
few months 
japans discount rate now stands at 525 percent one of the 
lowest among industrialized nations the country has been under 
pressure from its major trading partners to move quicker to lift 
the rate 
the higher rates banks must pay to depositors make it more 
expensive for them to acquire funds for lending and investment 
foreign exchange dealers in new york said the forecast forced 
down the dollars exchange rate against the japanese currency 
daiwa banks sumio fukushima said there was little chance that 
japans central bank raise the discount rate in the near future 
but in the long term its a strong possibility 
expectations of a statement in the houston conference of seven 
industrialized nations favoring a stronger yen were still weighing 
down the dollar other dealers said 
on the stock exchange dealers said the surge of the yen against 
the dollar and solid japanese bond prices encouraged buying and 
pushed the share prices up 
the price of the no 119 10year japanese government bond stood 
at 8678 points up from tuesdays close of 8674 the yield stood 
at 7240 percent down from 7250 the previous day

government officials today expressed satisfaction 
at the recognition of asian issues during the houston economic 
summit one press report found a japanese wind blowing at the 
annual gathering 
though the biggest political issues at the summit were how the 
west should react to the rapid changes in the soviet union and 
eastern europe prime minister toshiki kaifu had been determined to 
also focus on asian problems 
aid to china was a major component of the summit political 
declaration issued tuesday the document also cites moves to 
political openness in mongolia and nepal and praises the 
philippines government for struggling to uphold democracy 
a separate statement read in houston by secretary of state james 
a baker iii was especially gratifying to the japanese government 
because it mentioned japans 45yearold territorial dispute with 
the soviet union 
it also sought to encourage dialogue between north korea and 
south korea and expressed concern about north koreas failure to 
accept international safeguards aimed at preventing the spread of 
nuclear weapons 
a foreign ministry official said japan appreciated the first 
mention in a summit statement of tokyos demand for the soviets to 
return a group of islands in the kuril chain off northern japan 
we hope the soviet union will appreciate the weight attached 
to this message said the official briefing reporters on 
condition of anonymity 
the liberalleaning asahi shimbun newspaper said in a commentary 
that japan had stood alone at the summit in recommending the 
resumption of loans to china and in bringing up the territorial 
dispute in the context of the debate over aid to the soviets 
the leaders from each country must have sensed a sort of 
japanese wind with japan taking a clearly different stance from 
the other countries and kaifu announcing that japan would provide 
large amounts of aid to china the asahi commentary said 
kaifu was a firsttime participant in the summit with the 
leaders of the united states britain france west germany canada 
and italy but he has gone further and more directly than his 
predecessors in speaking out on the need for japan to exert 
political influence in line with its economic power 
japans economy is second in size only to the us economy and 
its role as the worlds biggest creditor nation is increasingly 
recognized as important if financial power is to be used to 
encourage the spread of western democracy and freemarket economies 
but japan rejects european proposals to give economic aid to the 
soviets citing the unresolved territorial problem and was alone 
in deciding to aid china other summit participants said china 
hadnt done enough yet in the human rights area to win an end to 
sanctions imposed after the brutal crackdown on the prodemocracy 
movement in june 1989 
japan plans to resume a previously frozen program of 52 
billion in loans to china over five years 
japanese commercial bankers also plan to consider resuming 
substantial loans to china in a positive manner taizo hashida 
chairman of the federation of bankers association of japan said 
at a news conference 
the summit went on debating trade issues with some japanese 
media noting that the name of the the conference site rice 
university could focus attention on japans ban on rice imports 
a cartoon in the asahi showed a cowboy kaifu riding a bucking 
bronco and shouting rice rice as the other government heads 
watched his oneman rodeo 
president bush is urging a phaseout of barriers and subsidies to 
agricultural trade worldwide that would force japan to end its ban 
on imported rice japan argues that it already imports half the 
food needs for its 123 million people and its a matter of 
national security to remain selfsufficient in the staple food

gov john ashcroft got his kicks by 
riding in a 1961 corvette and signing legislation designating a 
307mile stretch of nostalgic route 66 in missouri as a historic 
highway 
route 66 was never an ordinary road from the time it was 
commissioned in 1926 it was something special to those who drove 
it and those living along it ashcroft said at a billsigning 
ceremony tuesday making missouri the first state to give route 66 
historic status 
us 66 known as americas main street was made famous by 
the 1960s television show route 66 and the song of the same 
name performed by the rolling stones 
the narrow concrete ribbon also helped fuel booming southern 
california by carrying thousands of jobseeking midwesterners to 
the west 
the highway stretched 2400 miles across eight states from 
chicago to santa monica calif but the federal interstate system 
doomed route 66 and the last portions of the highway were erased 
from the nations road maps in 1984

thousands of people were imprisoned tortured and 
killed last year by governments seeking to suppress conflicts 
arising from ethnic tensions or nationalist yearnings amnesty 
international said today 
the human rights group also criticized the executions of 16 
people in the united states in 1989 and us court rulings that 
permit the death penalty for teenagers or retarded people 
convicted of murder 
in its annual world survey of human rights the londonbased 
organization said repressive measures in many cases served to 
entrench bitter conflicts and dimmed prospects for dialogue 
peaceful protesters in many countries were arbitrarily 
arrested in vast numbers many were held for months without charge 
or trial in countless cases state torture was the price citizens 
paid for being identified as sympathizers with ethnic or 
nationalist movements it said 
around the world particularly where the tensions erupted into 
violence tens of thousands of people became victims of security 
operations resulting in disappearances and extrajudicial 
executions it added 
the nearly 300page survey said ethnic and nationalist groups 
have been suppressed in somalia ethiopia sudan sri lanka india 
burma indonesia the soviet union yugoslavia china chad 
mauritania israel iran iraq turkey bulgaria guatemala and 
brazil 
in eastern europe it said new governments have emptied their 
prisons of dissidents but it said dissenters are still harshly 
treated in albania bulgaria and yugoslavia 
on a positive note amnesty noted the release of political 
prisoners in benin ethiopia somalia south africa and namibia 
and significant reductions in executions in south africa and 
nigeria 
the report cited disturbing us supreme court rulings 
permitting the execution of offenders who are mentally retarded or 
as young as 16 
with 16 executions last year the united states carried out more 
legal death sentences than any other country in the hemisphere by 
amnestys count cuba executed four guyana executed one and 
antigua and barbuda executed one 
amnesty says it opposes the death penalty under all 
circumstances 
the report highlighted these instances of ethnic or nationalist 
tensions being met by government repression 
thousands of sri lankans were reported to have disappeared 
or were summarily executed by government troops and paramilitary 
allies combating an armed tamil rebellion 
in somalia 46 members of the issaq clan including children 
reportedly were murdered by government soldiers in july similar 
reprisals were reported against members of the ogadeni clan after a 
rebellion by ogadeni soldiers 
fortytwo members of the dinka and nuber communities in sudan 
reportedly were summarily executed in october and members of the 
dinka nuber nuer and shilluk communities have suffered gross 
human rights violations solely because of their ethnic origin 
twenty people were killed when soviet troops broke up a 
peaceful demonstration in tbilisi georgia in april and police and 
troops assaulted an unarmed crowd of about 1000 people in the 
western ukraine in october 
an unknown number of tibetans were killed and more than 1000 
arrested when chinese troops broke up an independence demonstration 
in tibet in march 1989 and imposed martial law amnesty said there 
were many reports of torture involving beatings electric shocks 
and hanging by the arms 
israeli troops shot to death more than 260 unarmed

the dollar plunged to a 4month low against the 
japanese yen in tokyo today while the yens rise gave a moderate 
boost to prices on the tokyo stock exchange 
the dollar closed at 14810 yen down 150 yen from tuesdays 
finish of 14960 yen it was the lowest closing since 14647 yen on 
feb 23 the dollar now has fallen 290 yen in the last four 
trading days 
after opening at 14842 yen the dollar ranged between 14765 
yen and 14875 yen 
the nikkei stock average for 225 selected issues gained 14175 
points or 044 percent closing at 3229418 the index dropped 
38585 points on tuesday 
foreign exchange dealers said the dollars plunge followed a 
decline overnight in new york and renewed speculation over an 
increase in japans official discount rate 
the yen firmed after a washingtonbased investment advisory 
company smick medley international predicted that japans central 
bank would raise its key rate for loans to commercial banks within 
the next few months 
bank of japan officials declined to comment on the prediction 
japans discount rate now stands at 525 percent one of the 
lowest among industrialized nations the country has been under 
pressure from its trading partners to raise the rate to stem the 
yens weakness against the dollar and other major currencies 
higher interest rates tend to make a currency more attractive to 
investors 
daiwa banks sumio fukushima said there was little chance that 
the bank of japan would raise the discount rate in the near future 
but in the long term its a strong possibility he said 
spot transactions totaled 19591 billion up from tuesdays 
14668 billion 
on the stock market dealers said the yens surge and solid 
japanese bond prices encouraged buying of shares that have dropped 
to attractively low prices 
however they said many institutional investors sat on the 
sidelines amid uncertainty over currency and interest rates 
if interest rates go higher the big investors could be 
discouraged about risking their money in stocks said yoshiro 
inoue of nomura securities 
volume on the first section was estimated at 400 million shares 
up from a thin 350 million shares the previous day 
in bond dealings the price of the benchmark no 119 10year 
japanese government bonds stood at 8690 points as of 5 pm up 
from tuesdays close of 8674 the yield stood at 7215 percent 
down from 7250 the previous day

japans largest underworld organization has offered 
more than 67000 to the relatives of a man apparently killed by 
mistake in a gang war one of the syndicates lawyers said today 
two men opened fire june 29 on an apartment in osaka western 
japan where a leader of the hadani gang a rival of the mammoth 
yamaguchigumi had lived until just two weeks earlier 
the gunfire killed akira yamashita a 66yearold telephone 
company employee who had moved into the apartment with his wife 
it was the second death attributed to the yamaguchigumis 
battle with the hadani gang which began when a hadani gangster 
allegedly shot a yamaguchigumi member to death in the western 
japan city of fukuoka on june 28 
police believe the shooting was to avenge a turf violation 
both gangs are based in the osaka area police say the 
yamaguchigumi has 22000 members in about 800 affiliated gangs 
across the country while the hadani gang has an estimated 220 
members 
it is very hard to imagine that mr yamashita was not killed 
by yamaguchigumi members or their affiliates said yukio 
yamanouchi one of the yamaguchigumis lawyers 
yamanouchi contacted by telephone told the associated press 
that on the day after the killing he was told by a yamaguchigumi 
executive to take a briefcase containing 10 million yen 
67500 to the home of yamashitas widow and offer it as a 
condolence 
but before i could explain her son closed the door in my 
face yamanouchi said 
because many shootings have occurred in daylight and in crowded 
areas the gang war has received heavy media coverage and aroused 
strong police concern 
police also see the conflict as part of the continued expansion 
of the yamaguchigumi which has more than doubled its membership 
since 1986 by forcing rivals to either join its ranks or wage 
costly and bloody turf battles 
the national police agency estimates that one in every four 
gangsters in japan is now affiliated with the yamaguchigumi whose 
main sources of income are believed to be illegal gambling 
extortion and drugs 
though japan prides itself on its low crime rates and strict 
guncontrol laws police fear the yamaguchigumis growth will make 
gangland shootouts an increasingly serious problem 
we are being very cautious and have seen no indication that 
the conflict will end soon said an osaka police official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity he said 14 gangrelated shootings 
occurred in osaka alone in the past two weeks 
thirteen yamaguchigumi members were arrested last friday after 
osaka police raided 62 yamaguchigumi offices and homes no one has 
yet been charged in yamashitas murder however

with the smack of a sake bottle japanese 
shipbuilders today christened the worlds first ship that will use 
superconductivity to push itself through the water 
the hightech ship christened the yamato no 1 is a public and 
privately funded experimental vessel shaped roughly like a 
streamlined telephone 
the ships developers said they view the vessel as a prototype 
for highspeed seacraft it will use electromagnetic force instead 
of a conventional screw propeller to thrust itself through the 
water 
the main purpose of the project however is to demonstrate that 
superconductivity could be used to power a ship they said 
this ship has been developed without regard to cost its 
experimental said jutaro namba a coordinator at mitsubishi 
heavy industries in kobe a major port in western japan about 270 
miles west of tokyo 
the 185ton ship is 100 feet long and about 35 feet wide 
it is drydocked in the kobe shipyard of mitsubishi heavy 
industries japans largest shipbuilder and a member of a 
consortium developing the ships new technology 
superconductivity is expected to make the use of electricity 
much more efficient reducing the need for fossil fuels it is 
being developed for use in computers and their components in 
magnetically levitated highspeed trains electric cars and other 
devices 
superconducting coils made of niobium and titanium in thrusters 
underneath the ship are used to create a magnetic field that is 
repulsed by an electric current carried in water circulating 
through the thrusters the repulsion produces the same kind of 
force used to propel superconducting trains on land 
engineers who worked on the ship say a combination of helium gas 
and liquid nitrogen is used to cool the coils to minus 45247 
degrees fahrenheit at that temperature electricity passes through 
the coils without resistance 
the use of waterpropelled thrusters instead of conventional 
rotating screw propellers is expected to minimize maintenance 
problems as well as noise and vibration 
the vessel also is energyefficient most of the space on board 
the ship is occupied however by dieselengine generators used to 
provide an electric current for the thrusters for pumps and for 
onboard equipment the engineers said 
the ships main handicap at present is its speed a mere 8 
knots compared with about 40 knots for fast hydroplanes and to 
minimize its weight it has space for only about 10 people 
experts say new materials are needed to produce a strong enough 
magnetic field to propel the ship at commercially viable speeds 
officials say sea trials will be held next spring after the ship 
is fitted with thrusters and other seagoing equipment a smaller 
model of the ship first was successfully tested in 1987 
the vessel is the brainchild of a consortium of companies 
universities and government researchers led by the japan foundation 
for shipbuilding advancement with funding from the ministry of 
transport

the national endowment for the arts has adopted 
the us supreme courts definition of obscenity in deciding what 
works to fund 
the new nea guidelines on obscenity released tuesday appear to 
offer a much more vague standard than a previous definition of 
obscenity imposed on the nea by congress last fall 
lawyer floyd abrams a first amendment specialist representing 
the new school for social research in a lawsuit challenging the 
obscenity restrictions said the supreme court standard is a 
possibly useful step forward but certainly a confusing one since 
the nea seems to continue to insist that the original language be 
sworn to 
in a letter to the us attorneys office sent tuesday abrams 
asked whether the supreme court definition may be substituted for 
the congressimposed definition when artists sign contracts 
accepting nea grants 
abrams also asked that nea chairman john frohnmayer be made 
available for a deposition july 18 to answer questions about how 
the new guidelines should be interpreted 
alan taffet the us attorney representing the nea against 
abrams said the federal agency will ask that the complaint be 
dismissed 
the neas moves follows its denial of grants to four performance 
artists whose work has a strong sexual content 
the definition of obscenity imposed by congress last fall barred 
the nea from funding work that in the neas judgment may be 
considered obscene including depictions of sadomasochism 
homoeroticism the sexual exploitation of children or individuals 
engaged in sex acts and which when taken as a whole do not have 
serious literary artistic political or scientific value 
but nea spokesman josh dare said under the new definition 
whether or not a photograph is homoerotic and obscene for 
example will be determined based on the standard set forth by the 
supreme court 
that standard defines as obscene any work that the average 
person applying contemporary community standards would find 
appeals to prurient interest that depicts sexual conduct in a 
patently offensive way and that on the whole lacks serious 
literary artistic political or scientific value 
the new school filed a lawsuit in us district court 
challenging the constitutionality of the obscenity guidelines in 
connection with a 45000 grant to build a sculpture garden 
abrams said that if the nea had offered the supreme court 
definition to begin with rather than the congressimposed 
definition certainly there would have been much less controversy 
and less concern that people were being asked to sign away their 
first amendment rights now we have a situation of some confusion 
the antiobscenity campaign was spearheaded by sen jesse helms 
rnc his office did not return a call for comment

dozens of runners mostly young men test their bravery by running 
ahead of and alongside the bulls which are later killed in the 
days bullfight 
the annual festival attracts thousands of tourists from around 
the world it was the setting for hemingways 1926 novel the sun 
also rises

a judge ordered a county hospital to 
pay 121030 to the mother of a 2yearold who died of aids 
contracted through a blood transfusion in 1983 
i feel relieved i feel peace of mind and i feel that my baby 
is finally at rest belinda jackson said i hate to see anybody 
go through what my baby and myself went through 
ms jackson sued the hospital district after learning her 
daughter tristainne omega louise contracted the aids virus 
through one of eight transfusions she received at the hospital 
after a premature birth the girl died in 1985 
in a decision released tuesday state district judge william 
hughes found no negligence in the bloodtesting methods of the john 
peter smith hospitals blood bank in 1983 but did find negligence 
in the way it screened blood donors 
lowell dushman ms jacksons attorney said it is the first 
court victory nationally in an aidsbytransfusion case that 
occurred before there was general knowledge about the disease 
which appeared in 1981 the virus that causes it was discovered in 
1983 
we feel every time one of these can be won it breaks down the 
tremendous fortress of defense the blood banks have built 
dushman said 
assistant district attorney sullivan bradley who represented 
the hospital argued that no screening test for aids was available 
when the child received transfusions in 1983 
it is fair to say the industry is concerned about having 
todays knowledge and todays standards imposed on what it should 
have been doing were talking seven years ago he said 
hughes said the hospitals screening process to eliminate 
intravenous drug users as donors in 1983 fell below the standard 
of care to accomplish that objective 
the judge said evidence showed that well prior to 1983 
hepatitis b was known to be a sometimesfatal disease transmitted 
by intravenous drug users 
the blood given to the child was contaminated with the human 
immunodeficiency virus which causes acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome 
one of the donors identified only as donor x during last 
months trial was an intravenous drug user who testified in a 
deposition that hospital employees did not ask about drug use 
before accepting his blood

iraq said today that it is willing to 
cooperate with its former foe iran to boost prices of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries oil to at least 25 
per barrel 
the official iraqi news agency quoted an unidentified official 
at the oil ministry as saying baghdad believes raising opecs 
benchmark price could easily be achieved if all 13 member states 
adhere to production quotas 
the agency said the official was reacting to a statement earlier 
this week from tehran that higher oil prices was the only 
tangible common grounds between iran and iraq and should be 
exploited in the search for a settlement of their 10yearold 
political dispute 
the ina report monitored in nicosia came as iraqs oil 
minister issam alchalabi was in jiddah for a meeting of five gulf 
arab opec heavyweights the aim of the meeting hosted by saudi oil 
minister hisham nazer was to coordinate policy ahead of an opec 
meeting set for july 25 in geneva 
iraq is seriously calling for increasing prices to 25 per 
barrel as soon as possible the official said 
this can be achieved through adhering to the set quotas and 
avoiding violations and gluts until prices eventually reach 30 per 
barrel the official said 
at its last meeting in december opec set a total output ceiling 
of 21086 million barrels a day in an effort to defend an 18 
benchmark price 
but recently prices dropped to 14 dollars per barrel that was 
attributed to a glut on the oil market caused by the violation of 
production quotas by some opec members 
the chief culprits for overproduction are kuwait and the united 
arab emirates 
the oil ministry official told ina that overproduction by 
kuwait and the uae caused fragmentation within the 13member 
opec cartel 
the official said even if a 30dollar price is acheived opec 
members should keep working to increase crude prices under a 
strategy that would not allow any alternative energy source to 
compete with oil

a new nasa report concludes that the planned 37 
billion space station will require nearly 75 percent more 
maintenance than earlier predicted a newspaper reported today 
the conclusion prompted the space agency to set up a special 
team to search for ways to reduce maintenance of the 500footlong 
station the new york times said 
the newspaper quoted nasa engineers it did not identify by name 
as saying the station intended as a centerpiece for study of the 
solar system by spacewalking astronauts must be redesigned 
you cant do it as currently designed one of the engineers 
was quoted as saying you have to build a different station 
he said political pressure was on to downplay the problem 
theres a lot of pressure to make this problem not a 
problem he said 
neither the new maintenance estimate from an earlier team of 
experts nor the result of the search for solutions has been made 
public both may be released next week the newspaper said 
the space station would need more than 3800 hours of 
maintenance by astronauts each year the newspaper said 
preliminary findings in march by the earlier team said the station 
would require about 2200 hours of maintenance each year 
the special team was put together in june at johnson space 
center in houston to mount a crash search for design changes and 
other possible solutions but some on that team expressed doubt 
tuesday that significant progress can be made 
the numbers suggest the station cannot be built the times 
quoted a johnson space center engineer as saying 
the space agency hoped to begin building the station in the 
mid1990s the station would have a life span of 30 years 
billie a deason a johnson space center spokeswoman said nasa 
will have no comment on either the new maintenance estimate or the 
search for solutions until all findings are made public 
nasa already is under fire for a serious defect in the 15 
billion hubble space telescope hobbled by a mirror defect and 
fuel leaks that have grounded the 25 billion space shuttle fleet 
possible solutions to the space station maintenance problem 
include improvements to increase the lifetimes of parts combining 
several repair tasks at one time and having advanced robots make 
repairs

air force col fred gregory has reluctantly 
accepted his new space shuttle command after a fellow astronaut was 
grounded for disciplinary reasons 
this is a very difficult and emotional time for us we know 
that gregory said tuesday its like a mother spanking her 
child and says this is going to hurt me more than you its a bad 
experience but these people are mature enough and the group is 
mature enough to keep striving forward 
gregory won a shuttle command slot monday after nasa grounded 
navy capt david m walker walker 46 was suspended for 60 days 
for infractions that included an incident last year in which the 
t38 he was flying came within 100 feet of a pan am jetliner in a 
nearcollision outside washington 
nasa also announced monday that navy cmdr robert l hoot 
gibson was pulled from shuttle flight assignments and barred for a 
year from making t38 jet trainer flights for violating a policy 
that restricts highrisk recreational activities gibson was 
involved in a fatal plane crash at an air show during the weekend 
both dave walker and hoot gibson are terrific pilots but this 
is just a temporary activity and basically its a wrist slapping 
said gregory who said he has not talked with walker or gibson 
since the action was taken sometimes we have to do it to get 
somebodys attention 
a man answering the telephone at walkers house tuesday said he 
was unavailable for comment gibson has an unlisted number 
gregory with 7000 hours of time flying highperformance 
aircraft will replace walker on a department of defense flight 
scheduled for march 1991 he has flown twice before in space most 
recently as commander of a defense department mission launched last 
november 
no replacement was named immediately for gibson 
gregory said he was unaware of his being named to the upcoming 
flight until two minutes before an astronaut meeting monday morning 
i didnt know absolutely not gregory said i was 
shocked people were wandering around and congratulating me on 
getting another command but its one of these you take with great 
reluctance

thousands of tons of french fries hash 
browns and potato puffs destined for fastfood chains were 
impounded by a food processing company after pieces of wire were 
found in them 
metalladen potato products mysteriously began appearing at 
lambweston incs hermiston plant june 4 said steven johnson the 
plants former quality assurance manager 
it looks like wire from a wire brush that you use to scrape 
paint off or something johnson said in a telephone interview

the source until he and six other employees were fired because of 
the problem he did not elaborate on the firings and the company 
refused to discuss them 
black said he did not know whether plant officials had isolated 
the source of the problem johnson said he initially thought a wire 
brush might have been caught in a water pump feeding the flume a

tens of thousands of miners struck the 
soviet unions coal fields today in a 24hour walkout aimed at 
crushing communist party power and forcing the government to quit 
the walkout in western siberia the ukraines donetsk region and 
the soviet far north falls on the anniversary of a protracted 
strike last summer the worst soviet labor unrest in 72 years 
last years strike brought the coal industry to a standstill and 
crippled factories before the government promised the strikers 
improved living conditions and a greater saying in the management 
of their workplaces 
the miners say authorities have failed to keep their promises 
and say theyll form an independent union next month president 
mikhail s gorbachev would be the first soviet leader since 
vladimir lenin to face such a union 
they promise us everything our personal lives are worse than 
they were a year ago especially housing and food lamented 
alexander zuyevsky 40 who works in the october mine in donetsk 
the strikes come a day after gorbachev was reelected party 
chief by the communist partys 28th congress 
addressing the congress today gorbachev said his information 
indicated the walkout was not a general strike he said 
participation in western siberia was minimal 
we feel more understanding from the side of the miners he 
said 
strike organizers say the walkout affected about 200 of the 250 
mines in the eastern ukraines donetsk basin the soviet unions 
largest coal field 
they claimed that about 300000 miners would halt work in westen 
siberia alone but organizers in the coal basins could not provide 
any firm figures on the number of miners who actually participated 
some miners have already taken tough action against the long 
dominant but now discredited communists whom they blame for 
failing to solve the countrys chronic economic problems 
workers at the kalinin and panfilovsky shafts in the donetsk 
voted this week to evict party representatives from mine offices 
alexander tupikin a strike organizer at the panfilovsky mine 
said the communists should not be allowed special access so they 
dont pressure the working class which weve had for the 72 
years of soviet power 
at todays donetsk rally the mood of the crowd was angry 
speakers stood on steps in front of the party and government 
headquarters miners attending the rally fashioned hats out of 
newspapers to shield them from the sun 
from 10 years old i was against the party but only a few 
years ago were we allowed to speak about that andrei voronits a 
former miner from the region said in an interview he added that 
his main demand was ukrainian independence but that he also 
supported demands for better living conditions 
about 100 policemen kept order at the rally and there were no 
disturbances 
at a pep rally tuesday night strike organizer yevgeny moiseyev 
told about 150 miners i will call for putting the party on 
trial i ask you to support me in that 
a red banner with the slogan put the communist party on 
trial hung in the hall of the october mine where the rally was 
held 
on a bulletin board in the hall a handwritten notice calling 
for the resignation of prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov was posted 
next to official notices about mine activities 
the miners went ahead with their walkout in defiance of appeals 
by gorbachev and the 28th communist party congress under way in 
moscow 
at the congress on tuesday a leader of last years strike in 
the kemerovo region challenged gorbachev in the election for party 
leader 
gorbachev easily defeated the official teimuraz avaliani and 
solovyev said avalianis candidacy would damage his popularity 
among miners highly critical of the communist party 
last summers strike by miners was called to largely press 
economic demands such as increasing supplies of meat soap and 
laundry detergent but todays walkout was more political with 
miners demanding 
that the ryzhkov government resign 
that communist party representation be eliminated at factories 
and mines in the kgb the army and the police 
that political education classes for children be eliminated 
and 
that party property be nationalized 
government and party leaders already have rejected the demands 
and maintain they are doing all they can to improve working and 
living conditions for miners

television coverage of the house of commons which 
began as an experiment in november has not increased rowdiness in 
the chamber and should become permanent a commons committee said 
in a report today 
prime minister margaret thatcher and other critics had 
originally opposed the introduction of tv cameras saying they 
feared for the reputation of the house because of frequent 
boisterous behavior among legislators 
but the allparty select committee on the televising of 
proceedings of the house said in its report today that the tv 
cameras had not affected the behavior of lawmakers 
we believe we are justified in concluding that the experiment 
should be judged a success the committee said 
the panel which questioned legislators and broadcasters added 
that the experiment had met with a generally enthusiastic response 
from millions of viewers 
the 650seat commons complete with speaker in traditional 
horsehair wig centuriesold ritual and legislators who bawl hear 
hear and insults at each other voted 318264 in february 1988 to 
let the experiment go ahead eight tv cameras began recording the 
proceedings in the house on nov 21 
the house appointed an independent company to supervise the 
operation and sell the tv pictures to the british broadcasting 
corp and other broadcasters 
the house ruled that when proceedings get rowdy the cameras 
must shun the disturbance and focus on the speaker bernard 
weatherill 
the commons is scheduled to vote on whether or not to accept the 
committees recommendation within the next two weeks news reports 
predicted it will accept the tv cameras on a permanent basis 
the house of lords the unelected upper chamber of parliament 
has admitted the tv cameras since 1985 radio broadcasting from the 
commons began in 1975 and newspaper reporters were first let into 
the commons in 1771

mikhail s gorbachev today backed a top ukrainian 
official to be his communist party deputy in an election against 
yegor k ligachev the candidate of traditionalists 
speaking to the communist partys congress the soviet leader 
threw his support behind vladimir ivashko the 58yearold 
ukrainian president and former party chief for the post that will 
assume responsibility for the partys daytoday affairs 
he expressed his confidence and closeness to the man he chose to 
run the ukraine the soviet unions secondlargest republic last 
fall when party traditionalist vladimir v shcherbitsky retired 
it is important that these two people be close gorbachev 
said of the two top party leaders on tuesday gorbachev was 
overwhelmingly reelected to lead the party but he cannot devote 
full attention to the job because he also is soviet president 
a third candidate professor anatoly dudaryev 45 of leningrad 
proposed himself as a candidate a vote was likely late today 
as much as i have before no matter what my job i will be 
working for perestroika pledged ivashko an economist and 
engineer by training we have to do everything to renew the party 
and change its priorities 
we have to understand that without us without the party 
nothing will be left of perestroika he said in a forceful 
presentation to the delegates 
the stout whitehaired ligachev fought off a bid from the floor 
to prevent him from running because of his age ligachev is 69 and 
two efforts to require the deputy leader to be younger than 60 and 
then 65 both failed 
ligachev addressing the nearly 4700 congress delegates also 
said he had worked well with gorbachev 
he stressed party unity in his speech and in answer to 
questions spoke out against allowing private property in the soviet 
union 
ligachev said last month that one person could not handle both 
the party leadership and the soviet presidency inferring that 
gorbachev should step down as party leader 
but party traditionalists did not put up a candidate against 
gorbachev for the party leaders post and he steamrolled his only 
opposition teimuraz avaliani a local party official and coal 
strike leader from western siberia 
asked tuesday why ligachev did not run against gorbachev for the 
party leadership moscow party leader yuri prokofiev said the 
congress did not nominate him that says it all 
in his brief acceptance speech late tuesday gorbachev promised 
to take the most serious farreaching conclusions from 
strident criticism leveled at him during the congress 
earlier in the day he ripped into his conservative critics 
you can never go back to yesterday by any path and no 
dictatorship solves anything he told the delegates some 40 
percent of the delegates are party bureaucrats and some continue 
to run their districts as fiefdoms 
if any of the delegates came to the congress with the hope of 
returning the party to old conditions comfortable or 
uncomfortable this is not a question he said they were 
seriously mistaken 
gorbachev and seven others were nominated for the top communist 
party post all but avaliani party leader in the siberian city of 
kiselyovsk withdrew 
avaliani 58 also headed the strike committee in a protest for 
higher pay and better working conditions in the kuznetsk coal basin 
last summer 
his nomination came on the eve of a oneday political strike by 
miners protesting the communist partys power and the governments 
inability to fulfill the promises it made to end last years 
strike miners are calling for the resignation of prime minister 
nikolai i ryzhkov and his cabinet 
avaliani struck a moderate stance saying he favored continued 
government control of key enterprises he said he would support 
strikes only on a casebycase basis

the syrian foreign minister said today 
that israeli air raids into lebanon had complicated negotiations 
for the release of one of 16 western hostages held in that country 
by shiite moslem extremists 
in lebanon meanwhile a senior hezbollah official called for 
the release of all western hostages and of all lebanese detainees 
held by israel he reiterated the proiranian groups standard 
position that it is not involved in kidnappings 
hezbollah officials have often made such statements in their 
effort to distance themselves from the kidnappings but western 
intelligence sources insist hezbollah is an umbrella for 
underground factions holding most of the six american and 10 
european hostages 
mohammed yazbed a member of hezbollahs higher command told 
mourners in baalbek today we ask all those holding the hostages 
and those holding our detainees as well to release them 
we are against such operations kidnappings and support the 
freedom of individuals he said at the funeral of two hezbollah 
members killed in israels last air raid monday 
farouk alsharaa the syrian foreign minister was the first 
official to confirm a weekend report by the irans official news 
agency that a hostage most likely a european might be freed soon 
syria is the main powerbroker in lebanon 
sharaa said the raids sunday and monday against hezbollah bases 
in south lebanon which claimed at least 15 lives had undermined 
our efforts to secure the release of a hostage 
the syrians were instrumental in the release of american 
hostages robert polhill on april 22 and frank reed april 30 both 
were freed in lebanon and immediately whisked to neighboring syria 
for their freedom journey home 
syria maintains 40000 troops in lebanon under an arab league 
peacekeeping mandate they control moslem regions as well as west 
beirut 
syria iran and allied palestinian and lebanese factions contend 
that western support of israel encourages the jewish states 
attacks against arabs 
sharaa said he had no tangible developments to report but it is 
not unlikely that that would change soon 
he indirectly confirmed speculation in beirut london and dublin 
that the hostage to be released is belfast native brian keenan 
syria is in constant contact with iranian government officials 
and we are also in contact with the irish government sharaa said 
we are exerting efforts and we hope that these efforts will be 
successful he said 
asked when a release might take place sharaa said i cant 
tell you anything now 
he did not elaborate on the snags that followed the air raids 
but said i hope we will overcome these difficulties 
keenan 39 was kidnapped in moslem west beirut on april 11 
1986 as he walked from his home to the american university of 
beirut where he taught english 
in beirut shiite sources said this week iran was pushing hard 
for the release of a hostage to express appreciation for relief 
supplies it received from the west after the june 21 killer quake 
ireland had sent one of the first relief shipments to tehran 
after the disaster in which 40000 people were killed 60000 
injured and about half a million were left homeless 
irish ambassador declan connolly said today we continue to be 
very hopeful about the possible release of keenan 
he spoke to reporters after a meeting at the foreign ministry 
with one of sharaas senior aides nasser qaddour 
we talked about the possibility of a hostage release but at 
this stage it would seem there have been no concrete 
developments connolly said 
i think we require a little patience he added 
connolly a nonresident ambassador flew in from saudi arabia 
on tuesday on arrival he said he was in damascus to keep in closer 
touch with syrian officials to assess developments in a possible 
hostage release 
he said he had good reason to expect a release 
syrian sources and other western ambassadors said they had no 
concrete information to indicate the release of a hostage was 
imminent 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani has been trying to end the 
ordeal of the hostages in return for improved relations with the 
west 
but he is faced with growing opposition by iranian radicals who 
believe restoring ties with the west contradicts the teachings of 
the late founder of the islamic republic ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini 
rafsanjani leader of the socalled pragmatist wing in the 
iranian hierarchy argues that ending irans decadelong isolation 
would lure foreign investment and technology and help the countrys 
warbattered economy 
the longest held western hostage is terry anderson chief middle 
east corespondent for the associated press who was abducted march 
16 1985

italy and france are sending two ships to albania 
beginning thursday to ferry out more than 3500 albanian 
asylumseekers who have holed up in three western european 
embassies italian authorities said 
the first ship will leave the italian port of brindisi for 
albania on thursday evening an interior ministry spokesman said

at the last minute what time the ships will arrive at the 
adriatic port city of durres the spokesman said 
he added that authorities were afraid that if people knew the 
details of the operation albanians would rush to get on board and 
it would be a thing of biblical proportions 
officials said the ships will transport about 2200 people from 
the west german embassy more than 800 from the italian embassy and 
about 540 from the french embassy 
the other embassies in tirana had fewer people and would work 
out agreements individually with the albanian government the 
foreign ministry spokesman said 
scores of albanians began entering the embassies on june 28 in 
an effort to escape europes last hardline communist bastion some 
dodged bullets as they scrambled over embassy walls

czechoslovakia on a plane sent by that nations president vaclav 
havel 
the italian ferries the appia and espresso grecia will bring 
the asylumseekers to brindisi about 85 miles across the adriatic 
sea from albania the merchant marine ministry said in a communique

embassy will catch trains to west germany the interior ministry 
spokesman said speaking on condition of anonymity

the vessels which carry about 1000 people each usually take 
tourists to greece it was not clear whether they would have to 
make return trips for the refugees 
the first ferry will leave brindisi thursday evening and return 
the next morning the interior ministry said the french ship will 
go to albania on friday the spokesman said adding he did not know 
its return destination 
the italian red cross has been preparing to provide assistance 
to the refugees once they arrive in italy those who sought shelter 
in the french and west german embassies will be sent to those 
countries the spokesman said 
the italian spokesman said that ferrying out the albanians was 
the most obvious thing to do since the airport in tirana was 
small 
the appia was used by the red cross during an italian peace 
mission in lebanon in 1982 the agency said 
albanian leader ramiz alia introduced some economic reforms this 
year and began to improve ties with other countries the government 
has said it would consider establishing relations with the united 
states but alia has made clear he doesnt plan to adopt multiparty 
democracy or shed key communist principles 
the turmoil at the embassies appeared to contribute to a 
shakeup saturday of albanias ruling party politburo and central 
committee several hardliners associated with the late communist 
ruler enver hoxha were dismissed 
the italian official said the shakeup favored this solution 
of the ferries the official said he hoped that the adoption of 
internal reforms in albania would prevent a repetition of the 
assault on the foreign embassies 
travel has been nearly impossible for most albanians for 45 
years but the government recently said all albanians over 16 were 
entitled to a passport

negotiators for mozambiques leftist government and 
the nations rebels held their first direct peace talks this week 
and said today they would try to end the 13yearold insurgency 
the talks involving the rebels no 2 leader and a government 
minister could lead to a ceasefire by the end of the year said 
mario raffaelli a parliamentary deputy who monitored the talks for 
the italian government 
both sides met sunday monday and tuesday at the rome 
headquarters of san egidio community a religious organization that 
aids poor immigrants in italy and which also observed the talks 
the negotiations were not announced ahead of time and were held 
privately 
an estimated 600000 people mostly civilians have died in the 
war in the southeast african nation the rebels have been accused 
of widespread civilian atrocities by the us state department and 
others 
the war has left mozambique one of the poorest countries in the 
world annual per capita income is about 200 and almost half the 
15 million people require some level of food aid 
leading the mozambican government delegation in the talks was 
armando gebuza minister of transport and communication raul 
domingos no 2 official for renamo as the rebels are known 
headed the other delegation 
we could be optimistic about the possibility for a 
ceasefire raffaelli said i think its realistic that there 
could be one by the end of this year maybe in time for 
christmas said raffaelli a socialist who formerly was the 
foreign ministrys undersecretary for africa 
raffaelli said both sides would meet again in rome as soon as 
possible probably within several weeks 
renamo the portuguese acronym for the mozambican national 
resistance has been fighting a war against the government of the 
country which gained independence from portugal in 1975 
keeping in mind the greater interests of the mozambican 
nation both sides have agreed on the necessity to put aside that 
which divides them and to concentrate with priority their 
attention on that which unites them toward creating a common 
working base to realize in a spirit of mutual comprehension a 
dialogue within which they can debate their different points of 
view said a communique signed by the two sides and released 
today 
both sides said they were ready to commit themselves toward 
the search for a working platform to end the war and to create 
political economic and social conditions that will allow a lasting 
peace and the normalization of life of all mozambican citizens 
before the peace talks this week efforts by kenya and zimbabwe 
had failed to get both sides to the negotiation table 
raffaelli said both sides agreed a month ago to have the talks 
held in italy the vatican was informed about the peace efforts but 
was not directly involved officials at the news conference said 
pope john paul ii visited mozambique in september 1988 
renamo says its wants recognition as a political party and free 
elections but its political program has never been clear no 
government publicly supports the rebels although south africa 
openly backed them until it signed a mutual nonaggression pact 
with mozambique in 1984 
mozambiques ruling frelimo party dropped its marxist label last 
year and has been liberalizing the economy and politics the 
government of president joaquim chissano is working toward a more 
marketoriented economy and is considering a constitution that 
would allow independents to run for parliament however it has not 
come out in favor of allowing opposition parties 
the mozambican government still receives most of its weapons 
from the soviets but it has developed increasingly close ties with 
western countries 
britain helps train government troops and the united states is 
the leading food donor to mozambique

the judge overseeing the settlement of the 
governments racketeering lawsuit against the teamsters union has 
ordered broad supervision of the unions upcoming election 
complete supervision of all facets of the election process is 
the only way to guarantee the integrity of the elections and 
encourage extensive rank and file participation us district 
judge david n edelstein said tuesday in approving new election 
rules 
the judge made more stringent the new voting procedures proposed 
by a courtappointed administrator he gave the elections 
administrator michael holland authority over some election 
functions previously assigned to officers of the local unions 
the supervision in this election must indeed be expansive and 
proactive edelstein said 
helen hershkoff an american civil liberties union lawyer who 
represented a teamsters dissident group said edelsteins decision 
was a victory for union democracy 
the court really is asking for more strenuous more vigorous 
supervision than the court officer himself imagined necessary 
said hershkoff who filed a brief in the case on behalf of 
teamsters for a democratic union 
the rules establish secretballot elections of local delegates 
who in turn will nominate candidates for the teamsters 
international board at the 1991 convention also by secret ballot 
the board will be elected by a rank and file vote again by secret 
ballot 
if successful the election would be the first secretballot 
vote in the history of a union which has been the historic 
marionette of organized crime edelstein said 
the election rules stem from the settlement in march 1989 of the 
governments civil racketeering lawsuit against the teamsters the 
settlement was intended to rid the 17 millionmember union of 
corruption and establish new voting procedures 
in adopting the election rules edelstein overruled objections 
by the union that the new voting system gave a courtappointed 
administrator too much power over the union and its locals 
at an earlier point in his opinion the judge said he approved 
rules that guaranteed elections completely secure from 
harassment intimidation coercion hooliganism threats or any 
variant of these no matter under what guise 
the election rules were proposed in february by holland one of 
three courtappointed administrators of the settlement and were 
the subject of eight hearings held around the country in march 
an election under these rules beacons the coming of the light 
of freedom to this dark union edelstein said this court has 
reiterated that this consent decree is a unique attempt to cleanse 
this union these election rules are the linchpin in that effort 
the judge specifically ordered that all teamster locals submit 
election plans to the administrator that membership lists be 
released to any accredited candidate and that no delegate 
participate in the international convention unless directly elected 
a call the unions general counsel james grady was not 
returned

after a loud and often hostile public response tuesday night by 
more than 100 residents the library board voted 43 to rescind the 
limited access policy three of the seven trustees were absent when 
the policy was adopted last month 
the policy would have let parents in this south chicago suburb 
obtain cards for children under 14 years old that restricted them 
to the juvenile section 
opponents of the policy argued that children would no longer 
have access to such items as an encyclopedia and dictionary 
backers of the change said parents would gain more control over 
access to what their children read 
for more than 13 years library officials said oak lawn has 
allowed children access to playboy magazine and all other library 
materials excluding music videos which are available only to 
patrons 18 and over 
residents attending the meeting gave the board a standing 
ovation after the vote saying the quiet suburb could return to

lessons that should be drawn from last years turmoil and 
rebellion said the tuesday edition of the yangcheng evening news 
of canton seen in beijing today 
since it crushed the massive prodemocracy protests led by

last septembers 597000 but still below the 669000 of september

part of their efforts to prevent future student protests 
the allday college exams cover most academic subjects 
including history politics science and mathematics 
the yangcheng evening news said the history section of this 
years test stressed patriotism and invasion and 
counterinvasion in modern chinese history 
questions focused on the mid19th century opium war with 
britain which was shipping opium into china against the will of 
the chinese government treaties that china was forced to sign

a group of aborigines declared a 
provisional government today claiming they have been neglected for 
decades by state and federal governments and see little prospect 
for change 
michael mansell secretary of the aboriginal provisional 
government said it would be autonomous raise its own funds have 
its own passports and seek recognition by foreign governments 
it is a political body set up to provide leadership to the 
aspirations of aboriginal people the aboriginal activist told a 
news conference all we are asking is the right to control 
ourselves on our own land we dont want to interfere with you 
people but just leave us alone as well 
it was not immediately clear what effect if any the 
declaration would have the 1981 census said australia had about 
160000 aborigines comprising less than 1 percent of the 
population at the time 
estimates indicate the country had 300000 or more aborigines 
the indigenous people when european settlers arrived 
we would set ourselves a stage that in 20 to 30 years from 
now we would actually have enough land in this country so that 
aboriginal people could raise their own economy legal system and 
run their own government on it mansell said 
the new government received an early rebuff when federal 
aboriginal affairs minister robert tickner canceled a meeting set 
for thursday with mansell and other aboriginal representatives to 
discuss the return of ancestoral aboriginal skeletal remains from 
overseas 
a spokesman for tickner said the minister would not meet any 
representatives of a provisional aboriginal government 
mansell said the provisional government would encourage local 
aboriginal communities to take back what they consider their land 
by squatting on it and would provide them with financial and 
people support to resist police and government attempts to 
remove them 
however mansell said the provisional government was purely a 
political body and would not compete with any government bodies 
that provide services to aboriginal people 
he said the provisional governments main aims were obtaining 
land rights gaining control over aboriginal culture and heritage 
and pursuing the return of the aboriginal skeletal remains from 
overseas 
mansell denied the new government would cause greater division 
between aborigines and whites 
there will always be divisions in this country because there 
are two distinct peoples and there is nothing wrong with being 
different he said the only thing thats wrong with people 
being different is where one group imposes its will upon another 
funding for the new government would be provided by a system of 
rent payments the sale of aboriginal passports and donations 
under the rentpayment system already in operation in victoria 
state sympathetic whites who believe in aboriginal sovereignty 
over the continent pay nominal rent to the black community

artists intellectuals and students said 
today they would give up their strike only if the government agrees 
to work under a new president with no links to the communists or 
their successors 
the sitin strikers camping in scores of tents in the heart of 
the city forced the resignation on friday of president petar 
mladenov a leading member of the governing socialist party of 
reform communists 
since then they have made new demands and requested written 
assurances from the main political parties that they will resolve 
the countrys problems democratically in parliament 
spokesmen for the strikers said today they already had received 
such assurances from the opposition union of democratic forces but 
an answer from the socialists was still outstanding 
the peaceful strike was seen as significant because it has been 
joined by top scientists and professors including representatives 
of the bulgarian academy of sciences 
the students began their sitin about a month ago to protest 
alleged manipulations in junes parliamentary elections in which 
the socialists won a majority of seats 
their demands were contained in a declaration issued on july 6 
mladenovs resignation fulfilled one of those demands but the 
demonstrators also want a public trial of ousted communist leader 
todor zhivkov who under investigation for alleged abuse of power 
incitement to ethnic hatred and misappropriation of state property 
their other demands reiterated at an improvised openair news 
conference today called for 
a new president who is not linked to the political and army 
establishment 
removal of parliamentary immunity from people implicated in the 
running of prison camps in the 1950s in the 1968 sovietled 
invasion of czechoslovakia and in the state persecution of ethnic 
turks in 198485 
the whole truth about the bulgarian foreign debt now about 
10 billion and about the property of the ruling party and its 
former leaders 
strikers have named their downtown tent camp the city of 
truth 
every day we go to work and we move in our old communist 
world but after work we come here to this city of truth said 
ivailo slatanov of the academy of sciences biophysics institute 
in veliko turnovo 150 miles northeast of sofia bulgarias 
first multiparty parliament in 44 years faced a constitutional 
crisis tuesday as it convened its inaugural session without a 
president 
mladenov resigned friday after admitting he suggested in 
december tanks be used to disperse tens of thousands of 
demonstrators rallying against communist power no tanks were ever 
used 
he had been instrumental a month earlier in toppling bulgarias 
hardline leaders but the communist party remained in control of 
the government 
the opening session a ceremonial affair held in sweltering 
heat was adjourned after only 40 minutes and will resume july 17 
at the parliament building in sofia 
the grand national assemblys first task will be to agree on a 
presidential candidate and elections there is no precedent for 
electing a president in bulgarias parliamentary history

democratic chairman ronald brown made it 
official today the partys 1992 national convention will be held 
in new york city 
democrats will nominate the next president of the united 
states two years from now this week in americas most dynamic city 
and in one of the worlds greatest cities new york the big 
apple brown said in announcing the decision 
brown also said he was considering several format changes for 
the convention including possibly cutting the event from four days 
to three and holding it on the weekend instead of midweek 
brown flanked by democratic members of the new york 
congressional delegation made the selection announcement at party 
headquarters before heading to new york to celebrate the news with 
mayor david dinkins and other city officials 
new york was browns favorite from the outset of the search and 
word of his choice leaked monday after the chairman told top aides 
he had made up his mind 
new york officials believe the convention will pump some 100 
million into the citys economy and landing the event is a plum 
for dinkins who lobbied agressively for more than a year to 
convince brown to bring the party to new york which hosted 
democratic conventions in 1976 and 1980 
its a real shot in the arm for the city and a real triumph 
for dinkins said new york state democratic chairman john marino 
it was at the 1976 convention that the party nominated its last 
winner jimmy carter and brown predicted new york would bring the 
democrats luck again 
in the 1990s america will need a world class leader brown 
said george bush falls short of that mark in new york a world 
class city we democrats will nominate a president capable of 
reclaiming americas rightful place as the worlds most vigorous 
advocate of freedom and most potent ally of democracy 
even before browns official announcement there was renewed 
speculation over who will be the star of the nomination show at 
madison square garden with new york gov mario cuomo figuring 
prominently in the discussions 
i think cuomo will make the bid said democratic consultant 
bob beckel who predicted a handful of democrats ultimately would 
enter the 1992 race 
for his part cuomo said landing the convention was great 
news for new york city but the governor who faces reelection 
this year said the site would not affect his decision whether to 
enter the presidential race 
in any event cuomo said a new york convention wouldnt boost a 
cuomo candidacy you could make the argument that having it in a 
state other than your own would be better he said tuesday 
brown grew up in new york and is close to dinkins making the 
city his favorite from the outset of the site search new orleans 
was the other finalist but brown told aides monday that new york 
was his choice 
the citys early pledge to come up with the more than 20 
million needed to get the garden ready for the event and a pledge 
by prominent democratic fundraisers in the city to fill the 
partys coffers went a long way in influencing brown 
brown had said that new orleans chances were being hurt by the 
louisiana legislatures passage of strong antiabortion 
legislation it was a factor but not the deciding factor brown 
said today while offering repeated praise for new orleans and 
louisiana officials 
the site search had attracted considerable attention in part 
because of the lack of declared democratic challengers to bush 
this is the strangest quietest presidential political 
environment i have ever been in said democratic consultant frank 
greer 
but beckel and other democratic activists said potential 1992 
candidates are taking a fresh look at the race of late because of a 
growing impression that bush can be beat 
democratic sens lloyd bentsen of texas bill bradley of new 
jersey albert gore of tennessee and bob kerrey of nebraska are 
among those said to be considering 1992 runs and in the past week 
several democrats have said house majority leader richard gephardt 
of missouri has indicated he might reconsider his pledge not to run 
in 1992 
others frequently mentioned in such speculation include govs 
bill clinton of arkansas and l douglas wilder of virginia

the only pipeline feeding moslem west 
beirut with drinking water burst wednesday flooding a coastal 
highway linking the capital with south lebanon 
about a dozen ramshackle huts on both sides of the ouzai highway 
were flooded with water that damaged furniture and created panic 
among refugees several shops were destroyed by the water pouring 
in from the street at 5 am 
some refugees drained the water into buckets which they emptied 
into the mediterranean others dug holes in the floors of their 
huts to let the water out 
i was soaking i woke up and didnt know what was going on 
said fatima hasan a squatter living in a beachside hut with her 
husband and eight children my daughters and i immediately began 
filling up buckets and emptying them in the sea 
the water pressure carved a 43inch crater in the street which 
children quickly turned into a swimming pool 
there was no word on how long it would take to restore water to 
the moslem sector of the lebanese capital but the more than 1 
million people living there have long been able to manage without 
potable water by using bottled water or standing in lines at

a 27yearold woman testified today that she 
and marion barry snorted cocaine repeatedly from 1987 to 1989 in 
apartments homes boats and on two trips to the bahamas 
i hit the cocaine and he hit the cocaine theresa 
southerland said of a gettogether with barry in march 1988 at the 
washington residence of a friend of the mayor 
barry scooped up cocaine on a business card and inhaled it 
southerland told the jury at barrys drug and perjury trial 
on another occasion she tried opium with barry but didnt like 
it she testified 
it had a funny taste she said and made her feel 
lightheaded 
she said the mayor smoked it with restaurateur hassan mohammadi 
at mohammadis home the restaurateur testified that he knew 
southerland only as miss t 
southerland said she met barry at a washington nightclub and 
that the two became intimate 
marion invited me to the bahamas around thanksgiving 1987 
she said barry produced some cocaine piled it atop a dollar bill 
and took three or four hits she said 
she asked barry if she could go on a 1988 trip to the bahamas 
they stayed in separate rooms because i was concerned about the 
press she said she had carried some cocaine with her on the 
trip and the mayor helped her snort it she testified 
southerland said that on two occasions the mayor invited her 
aboard boats moored at washingtonarea marinas where the two used 
cocaine 
us district judge thomas penfield jackson issued a bench 
warrant for southerland when she failed to appear in court tuesday 
due to a scheduling mixup with her lawyer 
on tuesday barrys lawyers sought to portray mohammadi as 
willing to tell any story to avoid being deported to his native 
iran 
what would happen if he were sent back asked robert mance one 
of barrys lawyers 
i would be prosecuted by the new regime in tehran for 
having worked for the deposed government of the late shah mohammad 
reza pahlavi at the iranian embassy here mohammadi replied 
mohammadi testified that he supplied cocaine and opium to barry 
at least 30 times he said he and the mayor snorted cocaine in the 
upstairs bathroom at barrys home while 200 guests were outside the 
house at a summer crab feast 
he said he and the mayor smoked opium repeatedly at locations 
around washington 
mohammadi said initially that he used cocaine only with barry 
under questioning from mance he acknowledged that he did use it 
once with a woman who was with barry on a 1987 trip to the bahamas 
under defense questioning mohammadi acknowledged he had pleaded 
guilty and cooperated with the government in a prosecution 
involving payoffs to an immigration official the bribes were on 
behalf of wealthy iranians seeking permanent resident status in the 
united states 
every time that you get into trouble you get out by 
cooperating mance told mohammadi 
in connection with the probe of barry mohammadi has pleaded 
guilty to conspiring to possess cocaine 
if mohammadi is found to have cooperated fully with the 
government the justice department will recommend that he not be 
deported 
mance suggested that mohammadis differing stories influenced by 
his tenuous status in the united states and his desire to please 
prosecutors by telling then what they want to hear 
mohammadi detailed at the trial how the mayor shoved cocaine 
into a marijuana cigarette and smoked it calling it an mb 
special mance noted that mahammadi didnt mention the incident 
in his grand jury testimony in april 
mohammadi said he didnt tell the grand jury about it because he 
wasnt asked about it 
he said he lied to police in february 1989 by denying that the 
mayor was involved with drugs then reported back to barry on what 
questions the police had asked 
i covered wherever i could said mohammadi i was a true 
friend for mr mayor i was always there for mr mayor 
the restaurateur said he started cooperating with the government 
after barry was arrested jan 18 in an fbi sting because 
everybody came from the woodwork i did not have any choice 
because he had been implicated in barrys drug use by others 
barry is charged with 10 counts of cocaine possession one count 
of conspiracy and three felony counts of lying to a grand jury 
about his drug use

provincial riot police and mohawk indians 
blocking access to a golf course expansion project engaged in a gun 
battle today and a police officer was shot and killed authorities 
said 
mohawk leaders also said they took a police officer hostage but 
police did not immediately confirm the report 
we are now attacking the barricades and trying to pull them 
down said police spokesman richard bourdon indians inside are 
firing at police 
police said cpl marcel lemay 31 was shot in the mouth and 
died about an hour after arriving at nearby steustache hospital 
doctors said 
hundreds of shots were exchanged in the gun battle along the 
blocked access road 
the crackle of semiautomatic gunfire and the thud of tear gas 
canisters could be heard from the area as armed provincial police 
officers dressed in olivegreen fatigues and wearing gas masks 
confronted the young natives who had handkerchiefs tied across 
their noses and mouths 
as the wind moved the tear gas back across their lines police 
quickly retreated 
ambulances were dispatched to a campsite where about 300 
indians including women and children have been living to oversee 
barricades in the land dispute involving oka a town of 3000 that 
is 18 miles west of montreal and the nearby kanesatake indian 
community 
south of montreal another mohawk community blocked roads in 
solidarity with the indians in oka and thousands of commuters 
could not reach the city 
in quebec city acting public security minister michel page said 
he did not authorize the police action in oka an aide to premier 
robert bourassa said the premier was not contacted before police 
moved in 
earlier this week john ciaccia the minister for native 
affairs pleaded with oka town council to put its plans for a golf 
course on hold 
about 100 provinical riot police surrounded the wooded area in 
oka a suburb northwest of montreal island early today 
they ordered the people behind the barricade to move away so it 
could be torn down to enforce a court injunction ordering the 
indians to let traffic pass bourdon said police then moved in to 
tear them down and were shot at 
the reason we moved was because the mohawks were breaking the 
law bourdon said they were blocking a public road and this is 
a criminal act 
a mohawk woman standing near the police lines in oka eleanor 
montour 67 said i find it awful that police would attack our 
people 
were not savages were proud to be mohawks she said we 
were pushed around for centuries and were being pushed again and 
were getting awfully tired of it 
police and the mohawks pulled back from their positions after 
the gunfight the indians then seized four police cars and two vans 
and used a commandeered frontend loader to crush and overturn the 
vehicles to form another barricade thick black smoke belched from 
a pile of burning tires 
the indians also used the frontend loader to tear up one green 
on the golf course a photographer at the site said 
one jubilant mohawk fired his shotgun as the police cars were 
put in place armed indians barricaded a road to the golf course 
three months ago to stop the expansion project 
oka which is next to the kanesatake mohawk community near the 
golf course rents the land to the operators of the private 
ninehole course the operators say they want to cut down the white 
pine forest on the land and expand the course to 18 holes 
the land has been in the hands of the town since 1947 but the 
kanesatake mohawk settlement surrounds it and the indians have 
always maintained it is their land 
in a show of support for the mohawks at oka armed mohawks from 
the kahnawake reserve south of montreal set up roadblocks on two 
main highways leading to the mercier bridge blocking thousands of 
residents on the south shore of the st lawrence river from getting 
to their jobs in montreal 
they parked pickup trucks and other vehicles including a dump 
truck across the highways construction workers on the bridge were 
evacuated 
the roadblacks will remain until provincial police pull out of 
oka said one of the mohawks

a moderate earthquake shook parts of 
southeast alaska and the southwest corner of the yukon early today 
but no damage or injuries were reported 
paul whitmore of the alaska tsunami warning center said the 
quake registered a preliminary magnitude of 57 on the richter 
scale too weak to generate a tsunami or seismic sea wave 
the quake was relatively shallow about nine miles beneath the 
surface and was centered about 40 miles northwest of haines 
alaska whitmore said 
it was felt strongly in haines and also was widely noticed in 
juneau and in whitehorse the yukon territorial capital he said 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of 5 on the richter scale can cause considerable 
damage and 6 can be severe 
the quake that killed 131 people in 1964 in alaska registered 
84 on the richter scale

summit what summit 
houstons cab drivers and business owners had looked forward to 
big profits from the onslaught of officials aides and journalists 
at this weeks economic summit 
not so 
lavish spreads of food and prompt bus service all free left 
local people with empty cash registers 
business hathere might as well not even be a 
summit as far as im concerned cab driver charles rough said 
nobody needs transportation 
not even president bushs favorite barbecue spot couls been so slow 
d lure 
thousands of summitgoers out of the george r brown convention 
center 
why leave they were being served roundtheclock buffets of 
kung pao chicken swordfish and angel hair pasta 
the endless selections and roadblocks that made traveling a 
hassle did wonders for the caterers but not much for houstons 
texmex and texas barbecue eateries 
its been terrible we usually serve 500 people a day but 
monday the first day of the summit we only served 100 said 
robin upton a manager at ottos barbq president bushs favorite 
spot for mesquitegrilled fixings in houston 
they have barricaded the people so they cant get out or in 
we are right on memorial parkway where all the trafure aid they gave 
west 
germany the green light to complete a 31 billion loan and aid 
from the others will surely follow 
overall it is a giant leap toward trust after decades of cold 
war suspicion and brinksmanship 
the summit urged gorbachev to take more radical steps to 
shift billions now spent on the red army and on cuba into the sad 
soviet domestic economy hes probably planning to do this anyway 
in his drive to improve living conditions and hold to the levers of 
power 
if gorbachev succeeds in this he stands to gain meaningful 
and sustained economic assistance the windup summit communique 
said 
it was the wests second philosophical swing within a week not 
as dramatic perhaps as natos decision to reduce its reliance on 
nuclear weapons the rendering of first technical and then probably 
more direct assistance cant help but draw east and west even 
closer 
the nato summit took us toward a more peaceful world a 
british spokesman said on behalf margaret thatcher she believes 
this takes us to a more prosperous world 
a senior us official who has played a prominent role in 
framing administration policy put it this way 
there is a potential for a new economic relationship between 
the soviets and the industrial west i wouldnt say the 
relationship is there yet but what gorbachev gets out of this 
summit is a clear unequivocal affirmation of the belief of the 
seven that it is incumbent upon the west to help perestroika 
succeed 
reflecting the official concluded what this says is that 
were serious about this we would not be going through this effort 
and analysis otherwise 
unthinkable only last july when gorbachev knocked on the summit 
door and was brushed aside as a communist intruder the united 
states britain france west germany japan italy and canada have 
themselves crossed a threshold 
they emerged from this years summit in sunbaked houston 
itself a testimony to nervy free enterprise dedicated to 
perestroika and committed to invest in gorbachevs success 
theres a common determination that we have to respond very 
positively to mr gorbachevs request for a sustained economic 
dialogue between the soviet union and the group of seven 
canadian foreign minister joe clark said 
in declaring nuclear weapons a highly unlikely last resort the 
nato allies in their 41st year moved beyond containment toward one 
europe 
in committing themselves to help gorbachev in practical 
ways the summit leaders blurred the 45year divide between 
capitalism and communism 
at the start the industrialized democracies will take measured 
steps beginning with a study conducted by bankers and other 
experts of the inefficient soviet economy and the tentative moves 
by gorbachev over his five years in power toward freemarket 
reforms 
the study under the supervision of the international monetary 
fund is supposed to be completed by december although officials 
at the world bank said a year would be more like it 
in the meantime a tide of technical assistance is likely to 
flow west to east 
at this stage bush is reluctant to go further he wants the 
soviets to cut military spending abandon cuba and convert to a 
genuine freemarket system the summit agreed and so if these 
conditions are met bush may brave political fire from his right 
and propose more significant us aid 
i dont think you should ever say never secretary of state 
james a baker iii said tuesday in refusing to permanently rule out 
direct us aid 
and will gorbachev be pleased with the results of this summit 
i think he will find in the response a positive encouragement 
to persist in his reforms and that seems to us all the essential 
point douglas hurd the british foreign secretary concluded

a graduate student was sentenced to 
life in prison for murdering a professor who denied him a doctorate 
jens peter hansen 42 was sentenced tuesday for the 
firstdegree murder of university of florida cancer researcher 
arthur kimura last sept 1 
the sentence means hansen must serve at least 25 years before 
being eligible for parole circuit judge robert cates also 
sentenced him to four years for a burglarywithassault conviction 
to be served concurrently 
a jury convicted hansen on june 21 
hansen and his attorney steve bernstein asked unsuccessfully 
for a retrial they claimed hansen was insane when he devised an 
elaborate plan to kill kimura in the professors home and attempt 
to make it appear to be suicide 
assistant state attorney john carlin argued against the insanity 
claim 
what caused the tragedy was a monumental ego and a revengeful 
spirit he said 
kimura was head of a committee that in august 1989 denied hansen 
a doctoral degree in pathology trial testimony showed that kimura 
and other committee members voted to drop hansen from the program 
because he was straying from his goals and conducting lowquality 
research 
on sept 1 hansen packed rope a pistol and a padded baseball 
bat into a rented van and drove to kimuras home he planned to 
kill the professor by knocking him out and placing him in his car 
with the engine running to make it appear to be a suicide 
testimony showed 
the plan apparently failed when kimura set off his burglar 
alarm alerting police hansen shot kimura in the head outside the 
house and was arrested a few minutes later testimony showed

truce for only several hours the front includes the three striking 
sandinista unions

situation would be resolved peacefully

hours following gun battles tuesday between government backers and 
opponents 
for a third day the city was paralyzed its streets a honeycomb 
of brick barricades manned by armed people sandinista squads 
opened trenches in roads 
police used bulldozers to try to clean the streets without 
public transportation since monday thousands tried again to get to

transportation problems and supermarkets again were closed

usbacked government which is trying to cut the budget deficit 
and nurse back to health an economy ravaged by a decade of war and

an italianchartered ferry left wednesday for 
albania to pick up many of the 4000 asylumseekers who fled to 
foreign embassies to escape hardline communist rule 
another italian ship and a french vessel also are expected to 
reach albania in coming days as part of the operation arranged 
with united nations assistance 
the albanians have reserved for themselves the right to decide 
at the last minute what time the ships will arrive at the 
adriatic city of durres an italian foreign ministry spokesman said 
he said authorities were afraid that if they released the 
details other albanians would rush to get on board and it would 
be a thing of biblical proportions 
the ferry operation was expected to defuse a crisis that has 
shaken albanias hardline communist government and stalled its 
recent efforts to reach out to the west the rush to the embassies 
and a series of accompanying demonstrations were the biggest 
challenge to the government in decades 
one italianchartered ship the appia left venice on wednesday 
afternoon carrying nine nurses and three doctors from the red 
cross said lino de rosa a director of the societa adriatica 
navigazione the ships owners 
another vessel the espresso grecia was to leave thursday from 
the southern italian city of brindisi he said the ships were to 
wait in the durres harbor until the albanians decide to let them 
dock expected late thursday or early friday 
the first ship will bring refugees back to brindisi friday 
morning and a french ship would likely arrive in albania the same 
day an italian interior ministry spokesman said 
the first italian ship to return will probably carry many of the 
albanians who have packed the west german embassy since they are 
in the worst condition the foreign ministry official said 
speaking on the usual ground rule of anonymity 
scores of albanians began entering the embassies on june 28 to 
escape europes last stalinist regime some dodged bullets as they 
scrambled over embassy walls 
between 4000 and 5000 albanians are believed to be in the 
embassies about 2200 in the west german mission alone the 
arrivals have dropped off dramatically since police reimposed a 
cordon around the embassy quarter this week diplomats said 
italian authorities said an accord had been reached with the 
communist government on removing the albanians and now we are

asylumseekers

tirana was quoted in the budapest daily nepszabadsag as saying

embassy will catch trains to that country the interior ministry 
spokesman said speaking on condition of anonymity

italian embassy would be brought to a special reception center at 
the town of restinco outside brindisi

albanian leader ramiz alia introduced some economic reforms and 
social reforms this year including allowing religious observances 
and travel abroad which albanians have not been able to do for 45 
years the government also began to improve ties with other 
countries and said it was considering establishing relations with 
the superpowers 
since the turmoil at the embassies began the government has 
shaken up the ruling party politburo and central committee several 
hardliners associated with the late communist ruler enver hoxha 
were dismissed 
the italian foreign ministry official said the shakeup 
favored this solution of the ferries 
the official said he hoped that the adoption of internal reforms 
in albania would prevent another flood of asylumseekers

is rippling through right wing politics 
liebman 66 revealed his homosexuality simultaneously in the 
pages of william f buckleys conservative national review and the

comes with it liebman said in an interview today 
at the same time he said he hopes he will be an example to 
other gay people still living in hiding 
the main thing i want to do within the gay community is to 
help people come out to not go through all the crap i did for 60 
years he said

do with that which we deem to be normal and healthy 
liebman said he feels no rancor toward buckley even though they 
disagree on whether homosexuality is moral or normal 
there is nothing that bill buckley could say that would offend 
me or make me feel bad liebman said today

spirit of full cooperation that i think we all agree existed here 
in this summit 
the eight of us representing the people of france the united 
kingdom the federal republic of germany canada italy japan the 
united states and the european community all met and our 
declaration reflects decisions taken during the past three days 
here in houston to extend our long economic expansion strengthen 
the world trading system reiterate our support for the strength 
and debt strategy ensure open investment assist reform in central 
and eastern europe and the soviet union safeguard the environment 
help developing nations and reduce the scourge of drugs 
and on behalf of my colleagues id like to note several points 
of particular importance to us summarizing not reading in its 
entirety but summarizing some key points out of this declaration 
 
we are enormously heartened by the resurgence of democracy 
throughout much of the world and we welcome the spread of 
multiparty democracy the practice of free elections the freedom 
of expression and assembly the growing respect for human rights 
and the rule of law and the increasing recognition of the strength 
of open and competitive economies these events proclaim loudly 
mans inalienable rights when people are free to choose they 
choose freedom 
we the g7 are now in the eighth year of an economic expansion 
which has created millions of jobs accelerated the growth of world 
trade and provided tangible support for developing countries 
the process of economic policy coordination which we have 
developed over the years has contributed importantly to this 
economic performance however we cannot rest on current 
accomplishments each of us will continue efforts individually and 
together to maintain and improve conditions for growth 
economic prosperity depends critically on an open world trading 
system and we will devote close personal attention in the month 
ahead to achieving a successful outcome of the uruguay round of 
multilateral trade negotiations 
we have given our trade negotiators clear instructions on our 
commitment to conclude a comprehensive agreement which expands 
trade worldwide while bringing the greatest number of participants 
into a strengthened general agreement on tariffs and trade the 
gatt each of us recognizes that reaching this goal will require 
difficult steps by all participants we will not hesitate to take 
them this is especially true for agriculture where we are 
committed by this declaration to provide the strong political 
leadership necessary to ensure a successful and enduring result 
we agreed on the significance of the steps under way in the 
soviet union to liberalize and democratize its society and to move 
toward a market economy we welcome president gorbachevs message 
to us in particular his desire for a sustained economic dialogue 
with the west we want to support the reforms under way in the 
soviet union and all agree that technical assistance can help the 
soviets move toward a marketoriented economy some of us are 
already prepared to extend largescale credits to the soviet union 
we all agree however all of us that the soviet union could 
greatly improve the prospects for sustained western assistance if 
it introduced further market reforms cut its military spending and 
ceased supporting governments which promote regional conflicts 
we also took note of the importance to the government of japan 
of peaceful resolution of its dispute with the soviet union over 
the northern territories we see the need for a considered 
comprehensive western response in support of soviet reform efforts 
and we have asked the major international economic institutions to 
provide us by years end their recommendations for reform of the 
soviet economy and possible criteria for western assistance 
we are keenly aware of our responsibilities to pass on to the 
future generations a world environment whose health beauty and 
economic potential are safeguarded environmental challenges such 
as climate change ozone depletion deforestation marine 
pollution and the loss of biological diversity require closer and 
more effective international cooperation and action 
we are united on the goals and measures to be taken now 
particularly in relation to climate change and the protection of 
forests and in this regard we have agreed to complete by 1992 the 
work of the ipcc on a framework convention on climate change to 
begin work immediately on developing a pilot project to address 
tropical deforestation in brazil commence negotiations this is 
the third point to commence negotiations on a global forest 
convention or agreement to curb deforestation promote 
biodiversity and encourage sound forestry practices and 
reforestation 
we recognize the difficult economic challenges facing many 
developing countries including reduced growth and severe debt 
burdens and we have been in the forefront of addressing these 
problems and encouraged we are encouraged by the progress that 
has been made under the international debt strategy over the past 
year 
we have agreed to review options for helping those countries 
that are heavily indebted to our governments economic and 
political reform are essential for economic prosperity and 
political stability for those countries undertaking these 
difficult steps we offer our experience resources and good will 
we leave houston renewed by the strength of our common 
commitments to healthy economic growth and prosperity and freedom 
for peoples everywhere 
and in conclusion we have accepted prime minister thatchers 
kind invitation to meet again next july in london

promoting a stronger world economy through sound macro economic 
policies and greater economic efficiency the economic expansion of 
our countries now in its eighth year has supported notable income 
growth and job creation in the context of rapid growth of

of countries inflation although considerably lower than in the 
early 1980s is a matter of serious concern in some countries and 
requires continued vigilance external imbalances have been reduced

increased continuing adjustment remains a priority in order to 
counter protectionist pressures alleviate uncertainties in

impeached gov evan mecham was back in court 
today defending his right to run again for the office from which 
he was removed in 1988 
mechams candidacy is being challenged by dennis ingram an 
exhighway patrolman who maintains that mechams impeachment and 
subsequent conviction disqualified him from ever again seeking 
public office in arizona 
the state supreme court heard oral arguments on the challenge 
this morning 
the senate convicted mecham in april 1988 of two of the charges 
filed against him by the house and voted 1713 to invoke the 
socalled dracula clause which would have banned him from 
seeking office in the future 
but under the rules of the impeachment trial it would have 
taken a twothirds majority or 20 votes to invoke the clause 
arguments before the supreme court centered on language in the 
constitution limiting the senate to removal of the convicted 
officer and disqualification from holding office in the future 
ingrams lawyer michael meehan argued that the language makes 
both actions mandatory but mechams attorney donald macpherson 
said the language mandates only removal from office and that 
disqualification is discretionary 
vice chief justice stanley feldman acknowledged that the 
constitutional language is unclear 
dont you think one could read this clause either way that 
it is automatic or not he asked its just not clear 
both macpherson and lisa hauser who represented the attorney 
generals office and the secretary of state agreed that if the 
court finds that the language is ambiguous that it must rule for 
mecham 
justice james moeller told meehan that had the senate believed 
that mechams convinction would have resulted not only in his 
removal from office but his permanent disqualification from 
seeking office there might have been a different verdict 
how do we know what the vote would have been on impeachment 
had they known it would forever bar he asked 
chief justice francis x gordon jr who presided over mechams 
impeachment trial disqualified himself from hearing ingrams 
challenge 
feldman said the justices usually rule on such cases the same 
day that arguments are heard but he said the ruling may not come 
that soon in this case and promised only that there would be a 
decision as quickly as possible 
mecham has said that he believes one of his opponents in the 
september republican primary is behind ingrams challenge meehan 
says ingram acted as an individual and not on behalf of any 
candidate ingram is a registered republican but is not known to 
have been politically active in the past 
with incumbent democratic gov rose mofford not running the 
november election is wide open former phoenix mayor terry goddard 
is considered the democratic frontrunner and the republican field 
is split among five candidates 
mecham was convicted of misuse of money given to him by 
supporters and obstruction of justice in a coverup of an alleged 
death threat made by an aide

east germanys defense minister on wednesday 
warned against assuming that a united germany will be a nato member 
and said only a joint german parliament can decide on its military 
alignment 
no nato troops can be deployed in any case on what is now east 
german soil rainer eppelmann told east germanys adn news agency 
in an interview 
the future germanys military alignment has been discussed in 
the twoplusfour talks among the two germanys and the four world 
war ii allies that defeated the nazi dictatorship in 1945 
among those the soviet union is resisting nato membership for 
what will be one of the mightiest military powers in central europe 
but the united states along with france and britain maintain 
the nato alliance would be an effective watchdog over germany 
provided the newly united nation be a member 
in the adn interview eppelmann said the impression had gained 
ground in recent weeks that many regard future nato membership 
for germany as a done deal 
the ease with which many have mentioned full nato 
membership as if nothing less would do has made me worry that 
the concerns and interests of our eastern neighbors arent being 
given all that much weight he said 
eppelmann whose official title is minister of defense and 
disarmament said the question of nato membership should be settled 
after german unification by a newly elected allgerman parliament 
that would run contrary to the twoplusfour timetable which 
aims for the issue to be settled before a formal merger of the two 
germanys 
eppelmann added german membership in nato should be tied to a 
transformation of the military alliance into a political 
organization renouncing the confrontational elements of its 
strategy 
no nato troops including the west german army should ever be 
deployed on east german soil the conservative politician said 
the western allies have made similar suggestions in recent 
months and have also proposed that some american and soviet forces 
remain in their respective german zones for a certain period 
experts have predicted sheer logistics would stand in the way of 
a full withdrawal of all foreign forces in less than four years 
in the next two years east germany would reduce by half its 
national peoples army of just under 100000 activeduty troops 
and cut the number of main weapons systems by 25 percent to 50 
percent eppelmann said 
together with west germanys 465000 soldiers that would still 
leave germany with more than half a million troops 
west german officials are ready to reduce the size of the joint 
german armed forces and sources say they will accept a limit of 
400000 or possibly less

it was hated feared and flunked but 
soon the dreaded parallel parking test required of florida drivers 
will disappear 
a straightahead parking test will replace the parallel parking 
ordeal 
everybody hates it state senior highway safety specialist 
joe thompson said it is a feared thing by many 
state officials decided to drop parallel parking from road tests 
by sept 1 after six months of test programs at 15 sites thompson 
said 
the change comes after years of complaints calling the test 
obsolete in the age of sprawling parking lots 
the parallel parking test has also made nervous wrecks of many 
trying to earn driving privileges no doubt another reason why 
many have complained 
from personal experience in the field i would say it has to 
be the number one cause of failures on the road test thompson

sixmonth international monetary fund study he replied not 
necessarily

and france to defer to the united states on the subject of direct 
economic aid those two nations have said they favor giving aid to

after three weeks of studying astrology charts 
and occult books police hit the streets wednesday to await the 
zodiac gunman who will strike after midnight if he follows his 
pattern of the past four months 
twentyone days ago the letterwriting killer shot and wounded 
a sleeping homeless man in central park leaving behind a note it 
was the fourth time the zodiac had struck one of his victims died 
the shootings all followed a 21day pattern the first occurred 
march 8 followed by march 29 may 31 and june 21 the time between 
the second and third shootings was 63 days a multiple of 21 
each shooting has occurred early on a thursday the gunman has 
vowed in his letters to police and news media that he will shoot 12 
people one for each sign of the zodiac 
while police were out looking for the gunman some wary new 
yorkers were staying inside one census taker who spoke on 
condition of anonymity because he was afraid said people were 
refusing to cooperate with him after police suggested tuesday that 
the killer was getting peoples birth dates through census forms 
there are no questions about date of birth on the census only 
about year of birth and age said us census bureau spokeswoman 
deirdre blackwood who called police to complain about the comment 
if the pattern continues police believe the shooter is likely 
to strike again sometime between 1201 am thursday and dawn a 
police task force of 50 detectives has chosen sites where the 
shooter is thought more likely to strike and additional manpower 
will be out around the city 
police refused to detail their plans or how the sites were 
chosen but theories about the gunman abound investigators have 
probed the bizarre and offbeat in their efforts to anticipate the 
next strike by the zodiac who shot three people on the 
brooklynqueens line and one in central park 
detectives reportedly studied a turnofthecentury book called 
the law is for all which contains a series of revelations from 
a deity named aiwass 
the 21st revelation in the aleister crowley book reads 
natures way is to weed out the weak this is the most merciful 
way two of zodiacs victims including the one who died 
walked with canes another was shot while drunk and the fourth was 
wounded while sleeping 
another hypothesis involved the gunman superimposing the 
constellation orion over the city and shooting his victims to 
correspond with its stars orion is the hunter in mythology and 
the zodiac referred to himself as the hunter in a letter to police 
the gunman claims to be the same zodiac who terrorized san 
francisco during the late 1960s and early 70s kiling six people 
police doubt that but think he may be getting his ideas from a 
1986 book about the san francisco attacks 
despite his selfpromotional ways the zodiac remains a mystery 
to police two sketches of the gunman fbi psychological profiles 
and 1800 phone tips have so far turned up nothing fifty potential 
suspects have all been cleared police said 
despite the research and increased police patrols chief of 
detectives joseph borrelli acknowledges the best leads could come 
after the killer claims another victim 
the more times an incident occurs the better the chance of 
finding the individual he said

the united states and its trading partners agreed 
today to work toward a plan within the next two years to save the 
worlds forests from destruction but papered over their sharp 
differences on global warming in the interest of summit unity 
president bush hailed the stance taken by the sevennation 
economic summit on global warming as a reasoned position not a 
radical position thats going to throw a lot of american men and 
women out of jobs 
he told a postsummit news conference that the savetheforest 
proposals were strongly supported by west germany which had been 
the principal lobbyist for curbs on pollutants implicated in global 
warming 
bush succeeded in keeping out of the final summit communique any 
mention of european demands for target ceilings on emission of 
polluting gases blamed for a gradual increase in the earths 
temperature 
the summit leaders declared that we as industrialized 
countries have an obligation to be leaders in meeting these 
challenges including climatic changes ozone depletion 
deforestation marine pollution and loss of biological diversity 
environmental groups denounced the communique as a donothing 
statement 
despite their green rhetoric the leaders leave houston in 
the red on the environment said the envirosummit coalition 
of prominent environmental groups 
the summit is a failure on the environment because they did 
nothing on global warming said dan becker of the sierra club 
however the summits agreement to devise a forestry action plan 
could help the eventual easing of global warming because trees 
absorb carbon dioxide a major culprit among socalled greenhouse 
gases 
scientist say 20 percent of global warming results from 
deforestation 
the united states agreed to join in working on appropriate 
implementing protocols as quickly as possible to stem the warming 
of earths temperature 
us officials said the protocols should consider all sources of 
manmade gases and such mitigating measures as tree plantings 
president bush originally had said that these implementing 
protocols should await an international agreement on global warming 
in 1992 
meanwhile at bushs urging the summit leaders agreed to begin 
immediate negotiations on curbing worldwide deforestation the 
accord could include measures to prevent deforestation replant 
industrialized areas train third world countries in forestry 
protection and discussions on control of acid rain and other 
issues us officials said 
the leaders said the forestry agreement should be ready for 
signing by 1992 
the destruction of forests has reached alarming proportions 
the communique said 
the summiteers also signed off on a deal struck tuesday to 
implement a plan within one year to save brazils tropical rain 
forests the officials said 
summit negotiators also debated a us proposal to strengthen 
the tropical rain forest rescue plan administered by the world bank 
and various united nations groups environmentalists have 
criticized the program a ineffectual 
during talks by the summit partners representing the united 
states britain france west germany italy canada and japan 
environmental issues were overshadowed by trade farm subsidies and 
other matters but there was general discussion of the socalled 
greenhouse effect produced by air pollutants 
west german finance minister theo waigel said the agreement 
included an urgent pilot project that would lead to a reversal of 
the current destruction of rain forests officials said the world 
bank should oversee the project but no cost estimates or other 
details were disclosed 
the decision to postpone action on global warming and hold a 
study conference conforms with bushs contention that more research 
is needed before taking such dramatic steps to curb global warming 
when the economic summit countries met a year ago in paris they 
agreed to common efforts to limit emissions of carbon dioxide and 
other greenhouse gases which threaten to induce climate change 
environmental groups have accused the united states of failing to 
live up to that commitment 
the european economic community on tuesday challenged the bush 
administration to prove its contention that taking dramatic steps 
to halt the warming trend will stall economic growth 
jan laurens brinkhorst director of environmental matters for 
the european economic community said the facts do not bear out the 
theory that curbing carbon dioxide emissions will slow economic 
growth 
carbon dioxide is produced by the combustion of all fossil fuels 
brinkhorst said the world economy grew by 25 percent between 
1973 and 1986 while energy consumption remained flat 
economists agree he said that energy use could be reduced 15 
percent to 20 percent in the course of a decade without major 
economic disruption 
i would hope to see in a serious way the europeans and 
americans compare notes and actually see what is true whether 
you would have this tremendous difficulty in your economic 
performance if you would do something more about carbon dioxide 
emissions brinkhorst said 
carbon dioxide has been estimated to account for about 55 
percent of global warming but the timing and the degree to which 
the earth is expected to become hotter are uncertain

western leaders urged the soviet union on 
wednesday to overhaul its sputtering economy offering meaningful 
and sustained aid if moscow reduces military spending and 
eliminates subsidies to communist allies like cuba 
after three days of tough debate the group of seven reached an 
11thhour compromise to reduce agricultural subsidies and avoided a 
showdown on global warming 
it was a landmark economic summit the first since democracy 
swept through eastern europe and began to take hold in the soviet 
union 
wherever people are free to choose they choose freedom 
bush said 
in a political endorsement the leaders of the worlds seven 
richest nations hailed mikhail gorbachevs efforts to salvage the 
battered soviet economy and adopt democratic reforms the leaders 
offered immediate technical assistance and commissioned a study of 
soviet needs but president bush said he wasnt ready to offer 
direct us aid 
dangling a carrot before gorbachev the leaders said prospects 
for meaningful and sustained economic assistance would be 
enhanced by soviet decisions to introduce more radical steps 
toward a marketoriented economy to shift resources substantially 
away from the military sector and to cut support to nations 
promoting regional conflict 
maybe this can lead to american cash support bush said 
adding i wouldnt set a time frame on when and if the united 
states decides to go forward 
he pointedly said im not enthusiastic about the 
intercontinental ballistic missiles aimed at us cities and he 
said he found 5 billion a year in soviet aid to cuba a little 
contradictory 
according to a rand corp study the soviets provide 5 billion 
a year to cuba 1 billion to north korea 15 billion to syria 
1 billion to libya and 25 billion to viet nam countries the 
administration accuses of promoting conflict in their regions the 
soviets also aid afghanistan and angola in civil wars 
not everyone was happy with the us position or the study 
which will take half a year to do 
italian prime minister giulio andreotti said we are on the 
front line as europeans and maybe we can help the united states 
understand why we want to help the soviet union when someone is 
ill you dont want to wait for medicine 
bush described the the g7 policy on soviet aid as an effort 
to encourage forward motion and be helpful he said he would 
brief gorbachev on the summit results and had already sent a 
preliminary cable 
the various summit compromises were satisfying to bush he wrote 
the summits script for aid to the soviet union won a facesaving 
deal on trade and managed to hold off european demands for 
aggressive action on the environment 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd acknowledged there had 
been some hard words but it will be a more successful summit 
than if everybody had come here determined to sing from the 
beginning a unified hymn of praise he said 
the summit shelved proposals from west germany and france for a 
coordinated 15 billion aid package for the soviets but urged that 
technical assistance such as transportation and banking experts 
be dispatched to help moscow mobilize its own resources 
the g7 leaders said each country was free to send cash on its 
own and several were sure to do so the west germans have made a 
31 billion loan package designed in part to soothe soviet 
concerns about reunification 
west german chancellor helmut kohl said he regarded the summit 
position on aid to the soviet union to be strong backing for 
him when he visits moscow next sunday and monday 
kohl is working with the soviet union in trying to arrange 
german unification the soviets still have 380000 troops in east 
germany the bonn government has already expressed its willingness 
to assume all the east german trade and financial obligations to 
moscow 
the group of seven the united states west germany france 
britain japan italy and canada are the worlds wealthiest 
democracies and wednesday their leaders pronounced themselves 
pleased with the wests economic health celebrating the 
renaissance of democracy throughout much of the world the 
leaders offered this outlook 
the upbeat language of the final communique masked sharp 
differences on trade and the environment compromises were struck 
on both subjects to allow everyone to claim victory or at least 
harmony 
against opposition from european leaders bush fought for the 
eventual elimination of farm subsidies to clear the way for an 
ambitious global free trade pact 
a british source said the compromise the result of allnight 
bargaining was sufficient to get the americans on board but 
does not go too far so it drops anybody off the other end 
the final agreement called for acrosstheboard cuts in all 
categories of farm subsidies however it also contained a european 
demand that it be allowed to add up its subsidies by using a 
measuring device which the united states had opposed 
on the environment the european leaders decided not to press 
bush for specific ceilings on gas emissions widely blamed for 
global warming of the envirnoment instead they agreed to work on 
steps to stem global warming as expeditiously as possible the 
us position is that more study is required to determine the 
causes of the problem 
the leaders agreed to begin negotiations immediately to curb 
deforestation and they approved a plan to save brazils tropical 
rain forests 
environmentalists decried the outcome 
president bush has lulled the other g7 leaders into an 
environmental sleep that abandons their commitment to advance 
solutions to the worlds most pressing ecological problems said 
george frampton jr president of the wilderness society other 
environmental leaders echoed his remarks 
on the economic front the leaders noted that unemployment and 
inflationary pressures remained at unacceptably high levels in some 
countries but it offered no solutions other than a promise to 
continue their close cooperative efforts at managing the global 
economy 
the summit leaders also repeated past pledges to fight the 
scourge of drug trafficking and to continue support for efforts to 
reduce the oppressive 13 trillion debt burden being carried by 
the third world

the worlds richest democracies wrapped up their 
annual summit today setting conditions for sending meaningful 
and sustained financial aid to the soviet union and agreeing to 
reduce worldwide agricultural subsidies 
the lastminute trade compromise finessed a nasty dispute over 
farm subsidies 
the summit urged that western technical assistance be dispatched 
immediately to help moscow mobilize its own resources and the 
leaders ordered a study to recommend ways to target future aid 
president bush in a wrapup news conference said the moves on 
soviet aid were an effort to encourage forward motion and be 
helpful bush said he would brief gorbachev on the summit results 
and had already sent a preliminary cable 
in a final communique the seven leaders called on the soviet 
union to shift resources substantially away from the military 
sector and to quit support for satellite states and nations 
involved in regional conflicts 
maybe this can lead to direct cash support from the united 
states he said but bush said im not enthusiastic about the 
intercontinental ballistic missiles aimed at us cities and 
said he found 5 billion a year in soviet aid to cuba a little 
contradictory 
others were ready to move ahead we are on the front line as 
europeans and maybe we can help the united states understand why we 
want to help the soviet union said italian prime minister giulio 
andreotti when someone is ill you dont want to wait for 
medicine 
satisfied with their 11thhour compromises on farm subsidies and 
the environment the leaders quickly concluded their 16th annual 
summit this morning 
this was a summit that addressed itself to a rapidly changing 
world bush said 
trade negotiators reached reached a compromise agricultural 
agreement in the early hours today and the seven heads of 
government spent just a halfhour reviewing the document before 
giving their approval at their final session at rice university 
the united states insisted on language calling for 
acrosstheboard cuts in all categories of farm subsidies but the 
agreement also contained ambiguous language acceptable to the 
reluctant europeans urging each nation to make substantial 
progressive reductions 
the farm dispute had threatened to disrupt the annual gathering 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd acknowledged there had 
been some hard words but it will be a more successful summit 
than if everybody had come here determined to sing from the 
beginning a unified hymn of praise 
in a selfcongratulatory final communique to be read by 
president bush at the close of the talks the world leaders patted 
themselves on the back for a global economy that was still chugging 
along although at a decidedly slow pace 
the summit leaders noted that unemployment and inflationary 
pressures remained at unacceptably high levels in some countries 
but it offered no solution for the economic problems other than a 
promise to continue their close cooperative efforts at managing the 
global economy 
the communique also agreed to a pilotstudy to help save the 
amazon rain forests but in a victory for the administration did 
not press for specific reduction targets for the pollutants 
suspected of causing a global warming of the environment 
the final communique basically recycled many of the 
environmental pledges made by the same countries at last years 
summit session in paris 
the summit leaders also repeated past pledges to fight the 
scourge of drug trafficking and to continue support for efforts to 
reduce the oppressive 13 trillion debt burden being carried by 
the third world 
a passage on soviet aid was sure to cause reverberations because 
an aide to mikhail gorbachev georgy shakhnazarov had said in 
advance that preconditions to western aid were unacceptable we 
arent taking orders he asserted 
but bush said he was optimistic about gorbachevs response 
id like to think hes going to try 
the final statement read this way 
we also agreed that further soviet decisions to introduce more 
radical steps toward a marketoriented economy to shift resources 
substantially away from the military sector and to quit support to 
nations promoting regional conflict will all improve the prospect 
for meaningful and sustained economic assistance the last 
passage was a thinly disguised reference to cuba 
a rand corp study says the soviets provide 5 billion a year to 
cuba 1 billion to north korea 15 billion to syria 1 billion 
to libya and 25 billion to viet nam all of whom the 
administration accuses of promoting conflict in their regions 
the leaders said we all agree that technical assistance 
should be provided now to help moscow mobilize its own 
resources stressing that aid should begin immediately the 
leaders tacitly gave a green light to west germany which already 
has announced a 31 billion loan package 
west german chancellor helmut kohl said he regarded the summit 
position on aid to the soviet union to be strong backing for 
him when he visits moscow next week to negotiate terms of german 
unification 
the soviets still have 380000 troops in east germany the bonn 
government has already expressed its willingness to assume all the 
east german trade and financial obligations to moscow 
on the farm issue bush and his summit partners pledged to 
maintain a high level of personal involvement and to exercise the 
political leadership to ensure the successful outcome of a 
96nation effort to overhaul the global trading system 
the talks known as the uruguay round for the country where they 
were launched in 1986 are viewed by the administration as offering 
america its best chance to reduce its staggering trade deficits by 
expanding export opportunities for farmers and businesses 
european nations were fighting bushs proposal to phase out 245 
billion in farm subsidies over the next decade contending that 
would eliminate the jobs of 3 million european farmers 
in addition to the united states the other countries 
participating in the three days of talks in bushs sweltering 
hometown were japan west germany britain france italy and 
canada 
aid to moscow was the overriding issue during the leaders first 
postcold war summit in advance gorbachev had written the summit 
in a bid for aid and asking for a greater role in international 
market institutions the soviet economy is so weak that there are 
concerns that gorbachev would not survive without serious 
improvements 
the summit leaders agreed to help moscow but could not develop 
a coordinated approach they rejected calls by west germany france 
and italy to put together a 15 billion aid plan opting instead to 
order a study under the direction of the international monetary 
fund to assess what aid would be of most use to the soviet economy

a pair of northern spotted owls is causing 
problems for environmental groups who want to hold a concert in the 
forest 
the us forest service says the event would disturb two spotted 
owls near the concert site the fifth annual concert in the forest 
is set for aug 2426 in the willamette national forest 60 miles 
southeast of portland 
sponsors include friends of the breitenbush cascades and friends 
of the cathedral forest both groups are active in the fight to 
protect old growth forests the habitat of spotted owls from 
logging 
jim farrell a willamette national forest biologist said 
recently that a survey turned up a breeding pair of spotted owls 
with two owlets 1000 to 1500 feet south of the concert site 
the northern spotted owl will be listed as a threatened species 
under federal law on july 23 us fih and wildlife guidelines for 
protecting the owl prohibit activities such as the concert near 
nests farrell said 
however environmentalists say the music is primarily acoustic 
and they contend that the crowd which has reached 700 in past 
years will not pose a threat to the owls 
its an ironic slap to use the owl as a pretext to stop a 
lowimpact event said mark ottenad of friends of the breitenbush 
cascades 
sponsors said they would go ahead with the concert whether or 
not they receive the required forest service permit the event has 
been widely publicized in newsletters and outdoor magazines 
sponsors have rejected three alternate sites the preferred site 
is close to trails and offers views of the cascading south 
breitenbush river and many types of forest from young reforested 
stands to centuriesold groves

with the communist partys top job safely in his 
pocket once more it was time for mikhail s gorbachev to relax and 
have some fun with his comrades on wednesday 
gorbachev has been attacked by party traditionalists and radical 
reformers during the partys 28th congress in return he showed 
his pedagogical side lecturing the army of graysuited bureaucrats 
the largest group of delegates on the wisdom of his views 
tuesday morning he lectured on the need for change stabbing his 
hands in the air and letting his voice slide into the soft accents 
of southern russia as he does when he speaks extemporaneously 
later in the day he handily won reelection as party leader and 
he appeared much more relaxed at wednesdays session 
taking control of the congress after a break a smile broke 
across gorbachevs broad face as read a brief note 
please congratulate anatoly d kravchenko on the birth of a 
son an heir on the 10th of july the note said the congress 
applauded loudly 
he just learned about it with us gorbachev continued 
referring to kravchenko 
gorbachev put forward a proposal when the hall continued to buzz 
are we going to discuss what to call the son or not he 
asked the congress and then vote on it he continued to the 
roar of laughter 
before the break gorbachev had rescued the congress as it 
rumbled toward chaos under the unsteady hand of ayaz mutalibov the 
party leader of azerbaijan 
gorbachev disappeared from the dais less than 20 minutes into 
the meeting wednesay morning but mutalibov ran into trouble 
keeping order and discipline crumbled 
just as the delegates were squabbling noisily about whether to 
vote on a floor resolution whether to dismiss the government for 
failing to meet miners demands gorbachev strode on stage to put 
the show in order 
he apologized for his absence you should understand i have 
to be here and there he said 
within minutes he called a recess to cool off the congress 
he was generous to the delegates giving them more and longer 
breaks than usual he also appeared magnanimous with his foes 
gorbachev rebuffed efforts to put an age limit on candidates for 
the post of deputy party leader a move that if passed would have 
excluded yegor k ligachev gorbachevs toughest politburo critic 
at one point he gently reminded ligachev of the name of a 
delegate he had forgotten rather than let him stumble in earlier 
sessions he had not hesitated to cut off opponents when the debate 
was not going his way

black nationalist leader nelson mandela 
who reportedly has pneumonia cut short a visit to ethiopia on 
wednesday and flew to kenya where he arrived looking weary and sick 
mandela arrived on a charter flight with his wife winnie the 
71yearold african national congress leader walked slowly down the 
airplane stairs to the runway and used both hands to clutch the 
stair rail and support himself 
after greeting president daniel arap moi and his cabinet and 
waving to a small crowd of airport workers and security officials 
mandela and moi climbed into the presidents limousine and were 
driven away 
mrs mandela left in a separate vehicle 
the star newspaper of johannesburg said mandela had contracted a 
slight case of pneumonia and was seeking treatment in nairobi 
however a member of mandelas entourage contacted at mois 
official residence said mandela got a slight cold while in 
ethiopia and was resting 
i can assure you he is not at any hospital said the aide 
who refused to identify herself she would not reveal mandelas 
whereabouts 
mandela who was in ethiopia for the annual organization of 
african unity summit cut short that part of his trip by one day to 
fly to nairobi aboard a special plane provided for him by president 
hassan ali mwinyi of tanzania 
one hospital and one diplomatic source said earlier that mandela 
had been admitted to nairobi hospital a hospital official when 
asked if mandela had been there would only say the anc leader had 
not been admitted 
the star newspaper which has a correspondent traveling with the 
anc leader reported on wednesday that mandela had caught a cold 
while in ireland and it developed into pneumonia 
the paper quoted aides as saying the pneumonia was slight and 
there was no cause for alarm but that he would seek treatment in 
nairobi 
concerns about mandelas health have arisen several times during 
his sixweek tour through north america europe and africa several 
times he has had to postpone or cancel planned events due to 
fatigue 
he underwent surgery in june to have a benign cyst removed from 
his bladder doctors also have expressed concern about his heart 
mandela generally has been reluctant to draw back from a 
punishing schedule of political talks and foreign tours since his 
release from prison in february 
mandela was jailed for 27 years for opposing south africas 
whiteled government in 1988 he was hospitalized for tuberculosis 
after kenya he was to stop in mozambique before returning to 
south africa in time for his 72nd birthday on july 18 
mandela arrived from addis ababa nearly three hours late 
forcing moi to make two trips to the airport 
there were no welcoming speeches

senate majority leader george mitchell moved 
wednesday to cut off president bushs favored trade treatment for 
china saying the administrations hopes for improved human rights 
have proved futile 
bush notified congress on may 24 that he was renewing 
mostfavorednation trading status and its preferential tariff 
treatment for chinese goods 
the status took effect july 3 exactly 13 months after the 
governments bloody crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators in and 
around beijings tiananmen square 
but mitchell dmaine said that means china has no incentive 
to improve its human rights record or to keep its commitments as a 
citizen of the international community of nations 
mitchell with 16 other democratic and republican senators 
introduced a bill that would roll back the preferred trading status 
until the president certifies that political prisoners in china 
have been freed free emigration is granted surveillance of 
chinese students abroad is halted and religious persecution is 
stopped 
the certification also would have to assert that press freedom 
has been restored prodemocracy leaders arent being persecuted 
and internationally recognized human rights are being honored 
while its likely the bill could win majority support in the 
house and senate its far less probable it can win the twothirds 
vote needed to overcome an almost certain presidential veto 
mitchell said he was introducing the bill to give tangible 
expression to what he called americans overwhelming support for 
the dormant chinese prodemocracy forces 
bush mitchell said in a senate floor speech has adopted a 
policy of waiting and hoping for improvements in human rights 
waiting and hoping has not changed the policies of the chinese 
government mitchell said 
awarding mostfavorednation status he said rewards the 
chinese government for a year of political arrests and executions 
a year of intensive public security controls a year of continued 
arms sales to the mideast a year of restrictions on foreign 
journalists in china and harassment of chinese students residing in 
the united states 
the hope for freedom in china is as remote today as it was a 
year ago mitchell said

at a time of growing economic interdependence the summit 
countries have developed a cooperative process based on a common 
appreciation of the need for marketoriented policies and the 
importance of sound domestic budgetary and monetary policies this 
process has contributed importantly to the strengthened performance 
of the world economy and to improved stability of exchange rates by 
concentrating attention on multilateral surveillance and close 
coordination of economic policies including cooperation on 
exchange markets 
countries with sizable current account deficits should 
contribute to the adjustment process by the reduction of fiscal 
deficits and undertake structural reforms to encourage private 
savings and increase competitiveness 
countries with large external surpluses should contribute to the 
adjustment process by sustained noninflationary growth of domestic 
demand with structural reform in order to improve the underlying 
conditions for growth and adjustment and to promote increased 
investment relative to saving 
the investment needs of the world as a whole are expected to 
grow in the coming years particularly in central and eastern 
europe and in developing countries undertaking market reforms as 
well as in some industrial countries to meet these needs 
industrial and developing countries alike should foster saving and 
discourage dissaving 
we welcome the prospect of a unified democratic germany which 
enjoys full sovereignty without discriminatory constraints german 
economic monetary and social union will contribute to improved 
noninflationary global growth and to a reduction of external 
imbalances this process will promote positive economic 
developments in central and eastern europe 
we call on the member countries of the international monetary 
fund imf to implement the agreement by the imf to increase quotas 
by 50 percent under the ninth general review of quotas and to 
strengthen the imf arrears strategy

the open world trading system is vital to economic prosperity a 
strengthened general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt is 
essential to provide a stable framework for the expansion of trade 
and the fuller integration of central and eastern europe and 
developing countries into the global economy we reject 
protectionism in all its forms 
the successful outcome of the uruguay round has the highest 
priority on the international economic agenda consequently we 
stress our determination to take the difficult political decisions 
necessary to achieve farreaching substantial results in all areas 
of the uruguay round by the end of this year 
we confirm our strong support for the essential broad objectives 
of the negotiations reform of agricultural policies a substantial 
and balanced package of measures to improve market access 
strengthened multilateral rules and disciplines the incorporation 
of new issues of services traderelated investment measures and 
intellectual property protection within the gatt framework and 
integration of developing countries into the international trading 
system 
as regards agriculture achieving the longterm objective of the 
reform of agricultural policies is critical to permit the greater 
liberalization of trade in agricultural products 
we therefore reaffirm our commitment to the longterm objective 
of the reform ie to allow market signals to influence 
agriculture production and to establish a fair and marketoriented 
agricultural trading system 
the achievement of this objective requires each of us to make 
substantial progressive reductions in support and protection of 
agriculture covering internal regimes market access and export 
subsidies and develop rules governing sanitary and phytosanitary 
measures variations among countries in the mechanisms of 
agricultural support reflect differences in the social and economic 
conditions of farming the negotiations on agriculture should 
therefore be conducted in a framework that includes a common 
instrument of measurement provides for commitments to be made in 
an equitable way among all countries and takes into account 
concerns about food security the framework should contain specific 
assurances that by appropriate use of the common measure as well 
as other ways participants would reduce not only internal support 
but also export subsidies and import protection in a related way

to the kids in the workingclass

they were 
it was going slowly 
the stones had been used by backers of a massive sandinista 
strike to make barricades tying up this capital of 1 million in a

neatly alongside the ruptured streets available to be used again 
but on the northern highway the main entry to managua barriers 
of burning cars and the maltese crossshaped stones remained 
army bulldozers pulled them down and left police stood by as

however quarrelsome the western industrial 
giants took a historic and probably irreversible turn at their 16th 
economic summit toward a permanent postcold war relationship with 
the soviet union 
president bush and his six partners agreed mikhail gorbachev was 
entitled to their assistance they argued over details how much 
how soon what in return 
but they agreed on immediate technical assistance and dispatched 
a study team to recommend how to target future aid they gave west 
germany the green light to complete a 31 billion loan and aid 
from the others will surely follow 
overall it is a giant leap toward trust after decades of cold 
war suspicion and brinksmanship 
the summit urged gorbachev to take more radical steps to 
shift billions now spent on the red army and on cuba into the sad 
soviet domestic economy hes probably planning to do this anyway 
in his drive to improve living conditions and hold to the levers of 
power 
if gorbachev succeeds in this he stands to gain meaningful 
and sustained economic assistance the windup summit communique 
said 
it was the wests second philosophical swing within a week not 
as dramatic perhaps as natos decision to reduce its reliance on 
nuclear weapons the rendering of first technical and then probably 
more direct assistance cant help but draw east and west even 
closer 
coming after last weeks very successful nato summit which 
took a major stride towards a more peaceful world the results of 
thee meeting in house are an important step towards a more 
prosperous world for everyone british prime minister margaret 
thatcher said at a news conference 
a senior us official who has played a prominent role in 
framing administration policy put it this way 
there is a potential for a new economic relationship between 
the soviets and the industrial west i wouldnt say the 
relationship is there yet but what gorbachev gets out of this 
summit is a clear unequivocal affirmation of the belief of the 
seven that it is incumbent upon the west to help perestroika 
succeed 
reflecting the official concluded what this says is that 
were serious about this we would not be going through this effort 
and analysis otherwise 
unthinkable only last july when gorbachev knocked on the summit 
door and was brushed aside as a communist intruder the united 
states britain france west germany japan italy and canada have 
themselves crossed a threshold 
they emerged from this years summit in sunbaked houston 
itself a testimony to nervy free enterprise dedicated to 
perestroika and committed to invest in gorbachevs success 
theres a common determination that we have to respond very 
positively to mr gorbachevs request for a sustained economic 
dialogue between the soviet union and the group of seven 
canadian foreign minister joe clark said 
in declaring nuclear weapons a highly unlikely last resort the 
nato allies in their 41st year moved beyond containment toward one 
europe 
in committing themselves to help gorbachev in practical 
ways the summit leaders blurred the 45year divide between 
capitalism and communism 
at the start the industrialized democracies will take measured 
steps beginning with a study conducted by bankers and other 
experts of the inefficient soviet economy and the tentative moves 
by gorbachev over his five years in power toward freemarket 
reforms 
the study under the supervision of the international monetary 
fund is supposed to be completed by december although officials 
at the world bank said a year would be more like it 
in the meantime a tide of technical assistance is likely to 
flow west to east 
at this stage bush is reluctant to go further he wants the 
soviets to cut military spending abandon cuba and convert to a 
genuine freemarket system the summit agreed and so if these 
conditions are met bush may brave political fire from his right 
and propose more significant us aid 
i dont think you should ever say never secretary of state 
james a baker iii said tuesday in refusing to permanently rule out 
direct us aid 
and will gorbachev be pleased with the results of this summit 
i think he will find in the response a positive encouragement 
to persist in his reforms and that seems to us all the essential 
point douglas hurd the british foreign secretary concluded

leaders of the worlds seven richest democracies 
today reached a lastminute compromise on government payments to 
farmers in hopes of giving a push to stalled efforts to overhaul 
the world trading system 
president bush and the other leaders winding up their annual 
economic summit endorsed the compromise language in a short 
morning session the deal between the united states and its 
european trading partners had been arranged during an allnight 
bargaining session among negotiators 
bush said at a midday news conference he hoped the compromise 
would help efforts to reach a broad international trade agreement 
in negotiations that have been going on for four years 
the summit agreement called for acrosstheboard cuts in all 
categories of farm subsidies as demanded by the united states but 
it also contained less specific language that was more acceptable 
to the europeans 
bush acknowledged that there will be some political 
opposition in the united states to phasing out subsidies at home 
but when asked if he would press for such action he said 
absolutely we have to do it 
noting that no quick action was expected in europe he said of a 
us effort thats a little down the road 
the final language in the communique urged each nation to make 
substantial progressive reductions in the areas of export 
subsidies internal price supports and barriers to imports 
the compromise also contained a european demand that it be 
allowed to work out a formula to measure and then reduce a 
variety of farm subsidies this measuring mechanism had been 
opposed by the americans 
the leaders pledged to maintain a high level of personal 
involvement to bring a successful end to the uruguay round of 
international trade talks in december 
the farm fight had been a major focus in the three days of talks 
between the heads of government of the united states japan west 
germany france italy canada and britain the summit was held on 
the campus of rice university the sessions were also attended by a 
representative from the 12nation european community 
we consider the text in general as a satisfactory outcome of 
this meeting said a community official demanding anonymity 
everybody has got something out of it 
a british official hailed the farm agreement and said prime 
minister margaret thatcher believed it would mean a successful 
windup of the world trade talks 
bush had made achieving progress on farm subsidies a top 
priority at this years summit believing that without movement on 
farm subsidies an ambitious effort to rewrite the rules governing 
world trade could be doomed 
the united states has a lot riding on the 96nation uruguay 
round talks the president has said they offer the best hope of 
expanding export opportunities for us farmers and businesses and 
thus reducing americas huge trade deficits 
bush spoke forcefully during the sessions but he faced strong 
resistance from european countries who contended that his 
insistence on complete elimination of all tradedistorting farm 
subsidies could end up costing the jobs of up to 3 million farmers 
the leaders had extended their afternoon session on tuesday for 
an extra 90 minutes grappling with the farm subsidy issue finally 
sending lower level negotiators off to work through the night in an 
attempt to come up with compromise language 
the draft agreement specifically mentions reductions in the 
three areas of farm subsidies targeted by the united states for 
cuts these include export subsidies internal price supports and 
barriers to imported goods 
the united states had insisted that the areas be spelled out in 
any agreement despite opposition from the european community 
but in an effort to bridge the gap between the two sides the 
agreement also refers to the communitys more general approach to 
cutting subsidies which employs a technical yardstick to measure 
subsidy levels 
the global trade negotiations which opened in 1986 in uruguay 
are due to wind up with a final round of hard bargaining in early 
december in brussels belgium 
european community officials have long fought to protect their 
expensive export subsidies they contend that getting rid of the 
program would translate into higher farm prices in europe and 
result in the loss of jobs for millions of farmers 
the program gives exporters help so more highpriced european 
farm products can compete with lower prices on the world market 
the united states has responded by setting up its own export 
enhancement program 
american officials also have pressed the community to open its 
markets wider to foreign farm products and reduce farm payments 
that encourage overproduction of crops 
the uruguay round is being held under the auspices of the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade a forum and agreement for 
promoting freer trade

farmers ignored motorists jeers and 
blocked roads nationwide wednesday with tractors trucks and 
combines to try to pressure the government into guaranteeing 
minimum farm prices 
all main highways have been blocked with farm machinery 
police spokesman aleksander chyl said shortly after the start of 
the twohour protest organized by the farmers union rural 
solidarity 
all 49 provinces were affected including the road to the main 
border crossing with the soviet union at brest pap said in 
addition to highways many local streets were blocked police did 
not interfere 
although the protest appeared largely successful there were no 
signs that the government intended to retreat from its refusal to 
grant minimum prices 
the roadblocks were the latest challenge to the solidarityled 
government of prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki who in recent 
months has grappled with strikes by farmers and rail workers and a 
stream of criticism from solidarity chairman lech walesa over his 
tough economic policies 
in an attempt to smooth relations with workers mazowiecki met 
for two hours wednesday with a bluecollar delegation from the 
gdansk shipyards union members there accuse the government of 
forgetting its roots and not explaining itself to the people who 
elected it 
on the main warsawpoznan road just west of warsaw promptly at 
noon farmers rolled four tractors a truck and a delivery van 
decorated with whiteandred polish flags across the highway 
traffic piled up for a halfmile almost immediately some 
frustrated drivers turned around and others parked their vehicles 
and sat in a roadside restaurant 
some drivers yelled at the farmers 
whos going to pay this bill stranded driver mariusz 
maciejeski shouted referring to his lost time 
if this were 20 years ago during communist times you would 
be hanging from a tree said an outraged retiree who hit rural 
solidarity chairman gabriel janowski on the shoulder 
janowski remained calm and appealed to motorists for sympathy 
i hope you understand what this is all about this is our only 
form of protest he told one couple headed on vacation with their 
children they had shouted an epithet at him 
a few of the drivers did sympathize 
its not very pleasant to sit here for two hours but in my 
opinion the farmers are right nobody listens to them said 
mariusz wojciechowski of suwalki in northeastern poland 
janowskis rural solidarity is independent of the solidarity 
trade union movement under walesa although the unions were broadly 
allied in the fight against communism walesa is on vacation and 
planned no statement on the farmers protest his office said 
wednesday 
janowski said the protest was justified despite some concessions 
granted farmers this week he said guaranteed minimum prices were 
as necessary for farmers as a national minimum wage is for workers 
polands 25 million private farmers have been among the groups 
most harshly affected by the mazowiecki governments shock 
therapy to reform the polish economy higher consumer prices have 
sharply limited the market for their crops and dairy products and 
the big cooperatives that buy from them are on the brink of 
bankruptcy squeezed by high interest rates 
on monday the cabinet acknowledged the farmers difficult 
situation and made several conciliatory gestures including 
lowering interest rates on farm loans and providing emergency funds 
to allow dairies to pay off debts to farmers 
but the government has refused to give in to the demand for 
governmentset minimum prices saying that would run counter to the 
basic principle of establishing a marketbased economy 
the government twice has had to resort to force in the past 
month to counter farm protests first to unblock the main road 
between gdansk and warsaw and then to end a threeday sitin at the 
agriculture ministry

the soviet union welcomes efforts by the leading 
capitalist powers to create a new model of economic cooperation 
between east and west a soviet spokesman said wednesday 
speaking at a regular news briefing foreign ministry spokesman 
gennady i gerasimov said his country welcomed new approaches that 
correspond to the spirit of the times 
gerasimovs comments were reported by the tass news agency 
wrapping up a threeday summit meeting in houston texas the 
leaders of the seven largest capitalist economies urged that 
western technical assistance be dispatched immediately to help the 
soviet union mobilize its own resources 
they ordered a study to recommend ways to ensure that any future 
aid will be useful 
president bush said he would brief soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev on the results of the summit and had already sent a 
cable to him 
france and germany have urged a large aid package to gorbachev 
to bolster his reforms but other countries expressed doubts 
whether the soviet union could use the aid effectively 
gerasimov added that the soviet union also backed appeals by the 
capitalist powers for negotiated settlements to the conflicts in 
afganistan cambodia and angola 
he said the soviet union regretted a paragraph in summit 
documents on the soviet unions dispute with japan over the kurill 
islands 
the soviet union took control of the islands after world war ii 
and both sides consider them to historically be part of their 
territory the two countries never have signed a peace treaty 
ending hostilities in world war ii because of their differences 
over the islands 
the soviet union favors concluding a peace treaty with japan 
that naturally will cover the geographic aspect gerasimov 
said but talks to conclude such a treaty are part of bilateral 
relations and therefore we regard the attempt at internationalizing 
the question of the socalled northern territories as 
counterproductive

the government likely will default on its debt 
for the first time next month unless congress raises the limit 
before leaving aug 6 on its monthlong recess the treasury 
department warned on wednesday 
treasurys current estimates show that the permanent ceiling 
of 312 trillion will be sufficient only until midaugust 
treasury undersecretary robert r glauber told the house ways and 
means committee 
the nations debt topped the 3 trillion mark last april and by 
monday had surpassed 309 trillion 
while glauber did not say how much of an increase was needed 
immediately he did provide estimated ceilings for the next three 
fiscal years to guide congressional and white house budget 
negotiators as they continue their budgetcutting talks 
we estimate that a debt limit of 351 trillion will be 
sufficient to last through the 1991 fiscal year that begins oct 
1 he said current estimates indicate a need for ceilings of 381 
trillion through fiscal 1992 and 405 trillion through fiscal 1993 
rep sam gibbons dfla expressed anger that the bush 
administration was planning to add hundreds of billions of dollars 
to the national debt 
hes the president of the united states hes convinced the 
voters they dont need to pay for anything we can just keep on 
borrowing gibbons said my answer to him is no 
another panel member rep thomas downey dny asked glauber 
if he felt a twinge of hypocrisy asking for increased borrowing 
at a time that the administration is supporting a constitutional 
amendment requiring a balanced budget 
no he replied 
glauber testified that without an increase in the debt limit 
before the congressional recess it is likely the treasury will run 
out of cash and borrowing authority and efault on 20 billion of 
notes maturing on aug 15 and interest payments totaling about 21 
billion due that day 
also the united states most likely could not honor on aug 
3 3 billion of military retirement and salary payments or 
payments totaling over 11 billion to social security and 
supplemental security income recipients railroad retirees and 
veterans he added 
glauber also repeated treasury secretary nicholas f bradys 
warning last month that the governments estimates are uncertain 
because of difficulty in predicting the cash needed to bail out the 
savings and loans industry 
the government narrowly averted its first default last november 
when congress raised the debt limit from 28 trillion for the 
fiscal year ending sept 30 it also had come close to default on 
several other occasions 
the national debt has more than tripled since the beginning of 
the decade as the treasury was forced to borrow more and more money 
to finance government spending that exceeds tax receipts 
the annual deficits have gone down from their peak of over 200 
billion a year but the deficit still totaled 1521 billion in the 
year ending last sept 30 it totaled 15168 billion after the 
first eight months of the current fiscal year and some analysts say 
it could return to the 200 billion level again by years end

central and eastern europe at the recent conference on security

we discussed the situation in the soviet union and exchanged 
views regarding the message that soviet president gorbachev sent us 
several days ago on his economic plans we welcome the efforts 
underway in the soviet union to liberalize and to create a more 
open democratic and pluralistic soviet society and to move 
toward a marketoriented economy these measures deserve our 
support the success of perestroika depends upon the determined 
pursuit and development of these reform efforts in particular we 
welcome president gorbachevs suggestion for a sustained economic 
dialogue 
we have all begun individually and collectively to assist 
these reform efforts we all believe that technical assistance 
should be provided now to help the soviet union move to a 
marketoriented economy and to mobilize its own resources some 
countries are already in a position to extend large scale financial 
credits we also agreed that further soviet decisions to introduce 
more radical steps toward a marketoriented economy to shift 
resources substantially away from the military sector and to cut 
support to nations promoting regional conflict will all improve the 
prospect for meaningful and sustained economic assistance we have 
taken note of the decision of the european council in dublin on 
june 26 
we have agreed to ask the imf the world bank the oecd and the 
designated president of the ebrd to undertake in close 
consultation with the commission of the european communities a 
detailed study of the soviet economy to make recommendations for 
its reform and to establish the criteria under which western 
economic assistance could effectively support these reforms this 
work should be completed by years end and be convened by the imf 
we took note of the importance to the government of japan of the 
peaceful resolution of its dispute with the soviet union over the 
northern territories

the medicare program pays at least 400 
million annually for medical services that should instead be 
covered by private insurance plans a federal official told a 
senate subcommittee wednesday 
michael mangano a deputy inspector general at the department of 
health and human services testified the money is being lost 
because the medicare program does not ensure that companies that 
insure people who also receive medicare pay the primary cost of 
their medical bills 
he estimated the annual loss at between 400 million and 600 
million based on 1988 data but added that is a very 
conservative estimate 
sen william roth rdel ranking member of the senate 
government affairs investigations subcommittee said other 
estimates put the loss as high as 1 billion a year and called the 
problem absolutely astounding 
it gives lie to claims that the federal government needs to 
raise taxes to make its budgetary ends meet said roth until 
we get our house in order on the waste fraud and abuse that cost 
the taxpayers so dearly we have no right to ask these same 
taxpayers to shell out even more in taxes 
mangano said his office has recommended that the health care 
financing administration which handles medicare improve efforts 
to determine when beneficiaries are also covered by private 
insurance although hcfa has taken some actions agency officials 
have not eliminated the problems he said 
the 105 million medicare program helps pay the medical expenses 
for about 34 million americans who are 65 and older or are disabled 
the subcommittee focused on one insurance company provident 
life and accident insurance co which roth said allegedly 
followed a deliberate policy of evading payments on claims of 
patients they had insured by foisting these claims off on 
medicare 
the inspector generals office recommended government action 
against the company but the justice department declined to 
prosecute due to manpower shortages and because other remedies 
were available mangano said 
larry simmons of the inspector generals office said the inquiry 
and internal company memos show providents strategy appeared to be 
that they would not pay until someone told them to 
winston w walker president of the chattanooga tennbased 
insurance company testified that the blame was medicares alone 
our company was prepared to pay as primary payer but its 
efforts to determine how much and when to pay a claim were 
rebuffed by medicare officials he said 
he said medicare has no procedures to identify beneficiaries 
with other insurance coverage before it pays a claim 
medicare and an insurance plan often both paid benefits to 
healthcare providers or beneficiaries he said medicare then 
expected the recipient to volunteer to repay medicare the amount 
overpaid he said 
provident did not cause this breakdown and provident cannot 
fix it walker said only the government can fix it and then 
only by implementing rational administrative procedures

the sound of music is a silent one for 
audrey stevenson but that wont stop her from singing her kind of 
music at the miss new york state pageant this week 
the 20yearold stevenson is the first deaf contestant ever in 
the miss new york state pageant she is one of 17 women vying to 
become the successor to the reigning miss new york lisa molella 
saturday night in watertown 
stevenson a civilian postal clerk at the us armys fort drum 
enters the state pageant as miss thousand island a title she won 
in part by singing in sign language 
its hard not to be moved by her talent said sharon 
cantwell director of the miss thousand island pageant 
stevenson turned down an opportunity to compete in the 
preliminaries for the miss deaf america pageant for a chance at the 
miss new york crown

hearing people to understand better the world of a deaf person i 
want to show other deaf people that they can realize their goals

penalty of five to 20 years in jail and a 15000 fine upon 
conviction

here is the text of president bushs news 
conference wednesday at the sevennation economic summit 
president bush well thank you all very much and i have a 
brief opening statement and then ill be glad to respond to your 
questions 
my colleagues from france and the united kingdom germany 
canada italy japan and the european communities and i have just 
completed this 16th meeting of the leaders of the largest 
industrialized democracies and this the first economic summit of 
the postwar period celebrates the resurgence of democracy and free 
markets around the world 
over the past three days weve had full discussions on the key 
issues of our time advancing political and economic freedom 
promoting sustained economic growth both in developed and 
developing countries assisting the transition to market economies 
in central and eastern europe and indeed in the soviet union and 
protecting the environment 
we are united in a common goal to extend to those who seek 
political and economic freedom a helping hand with our resources 
talents and experience as our declaration states when people 
are free to choose they choose freedom 
we identified the successful completion of the uruguay round of 
global trade talks as one of the highest economic priorities and 
we recognized that agreement on fundamental reform of agriculture 
is critical to achieving this goal we commended the report by the 
chairman of the gatt the gatt agricultural group the de zeeuw 
report to our negotiators as a vehicle to move these talks forward 
and we also committed to maintain our personal involvement and to 
exercise political leadership at every step along the way as we 
move toward the final ministerial meeting in december 
on the soviet union we discussed our common efforts to assist 
the soviet reform effort the success of which is in our common 
interest in addition to offering the soviets technical assistance 
weve asked the imf to coordinate a major study of the soviet 
economy and make recommendation for its reform in keeping with the 
agreements reached here i will be conveying to president gorbachev 
the results of our deliberations 
we achieved major progress on the environment particularly on 
climate change and forests we committed to finish the negotiations 
on a framework climate change convention by 1992 in a first we 
agreed that implementing protocols should consider all sources and 
sinks of greenhouse gases consistent with the comprehensive 
approach that we recommend 
we agreed to launch a special effort to address the 
deforestation in the rain forests a concern that was very 
forcefully raised by chancellor kohl and i found a very receptive 
audience for my proposal that a freestanding global forest 
convention be negotiated without delay and we agreed to move ahead 
on this rapidly 
in short this was a summit that addressed itself to a rapidly 
changing world we agreed to welcome respond to and manage the 
changes on behalf of free markets free political systems and a 
better life for people everywhere it is no small achievement that 
we came to a positive and unanimous conclusion on so many important 
and difficult issues and i would stress those two words positive 
and unanimous 
and i want to congratulate my colleagues on the results of the 
collective effort i think they left feeling good we had a very 
generous letter to our secretary of state just now received from 
prime minister mulroney and hes a veteran of these summits 
and i must say to the canadians here i once again benefited 
from his not only his commitment learned from his commitment on 
certain issues like the environment but benefited from his advice 
i also want to thank the two secretaries who were at my side 
secretary baker and secretary brady ambassador carla hills 
secretary yeutter secretary mosbacher who worked with their 
colleagues and others at this summit i want to thank the sherpas 
most of them stayed up i understand they all stayed up to 4 this 
morning in ironing out this final communique so it was a team 
effort and i think most of our well i think all of our summit 
participants left feeling good about this particular summit 
and now i think terry hunt has the first question

what is believed to be the last handcranked 
magnetooperated telephone party line in the united states is 
hanging it up after six decades the agriculture department said 
wednesday 
the 20party single line system runs for 40 miles strung on 
trees fence posts and treacherous cliffs high above the salmon 
river in an isolated section of eastcentral idaho in the salmon 
river national forest 
the line operated by the nonprofit north fork telephone corp 
was installed by the us forest service in 1931 and sold to users 
for 1 in 1952 
in its place will be a 250000 stateofart digital system 
operated by the rural telephone co of glenns ferry idaho said 
the departments rural electrification administration which 
provided financing for the new system 
one of the old systems last customers garry pedrow said he 
hated to see the change because of the systems historical value 
but as far as being in business its hard to communicate on this 
line 
his wife peggy agreed 
once its gone its gone forever but i guess im ready 
because i cant hear anything on the 40mile party line 
the size of the system will almost triple immediately to a total 
of 37 subscribers the rea said 
a buried cable is the heart of the new system most of it along 
a narrow deadend roadbed the only way other than the river 
in and out of the 40mile canyon 
the first call scheduled for early friday is to be made from 
shoups country store and post office run by the pedrows in the 
canyons only town population 2 
joe miller president of the idaho public utilities commission 
was scheduled to make the ceremonial call to gary c byrne rea 
administrator who will be attending a rural development conference 
in denver 
the rea began making rural electric loans in 1935 and was 
authorized by congress in 1949 to develop a similar program for 
telephones since then the agency has approved 89 billion in 
direct and guaranteed loans for more than 1000 telephone systems 
rea spokesman jim mckenna said nearly all rural handcranked 
magneto telephones were converted to modern versions by 1970 at 
the peak he said perhaps 125 million had served the nations 
farms by conservative estimates 
when they were installed decades ago most handcranked phones 
were wallmounted units with a black metal mouthpiece on an arm and 
a receiver hung on a twoprong hook on the left side 
a crank on the right side rang bells along the line and if 
one persisted in cranking in a central office where an 
operator took care of calls to town numbers or longdistance 
each farm had a coded ring two longs and a short for example 
the customer being called was supposed to answer that ring and 
ignore the rest 
but party line chatter with two or three parties talking and 
several more secretly listening was a popular rural recreation 
long before electricity television and even radio 
a line call of continuous ringing was often used to alert 
families of emergencies such as approaching storms tornadoes or 
fires in forest areas and on the prairie

q mr president id like to ask you about soviet aid is this 
sixmonth study of soviet needs a way of delaying a political 
decision on aid or at the end of that will the united states make 
a commitment to send some cash to moscow 
a well its not an effort to delay anything it is as we said 
in the report a step towards assisting the reforms and ill make 
clear to president gorbachev that he ought to view this outcome of 
this summit very positively you may remember that in london only a 
few days ago i gave my views on the us lending money at this 
time so its not an effort to forestall anything its an effort 
to move forward and encourage forward motion and be helpful to the 
soviet union in terms of reform they need much much more reform 
and theyre the ones that say this 
and in gorbachevs letter he asked for assistance in many areas 
personnel management and how they change their systems and 
weve already started bilaterally as have other countries in 
trying to assist so its really a coordinated effort to help the 
soviet union 
q well in six months then can mr gorbachev expect that the 
united states will be sending some financial assistance to meet 
these needs 
a not particularly not necessarily but what he can expect is 
that we will have been helpful to him in the reforms that he knows 
that he has to undertake and maybe you know this this could 
lead to support but there are things that have to happen and ive 
been very up front with him personally and then in public 
statements as to what has to what has to happen for the united 
states to send money 
and incidentally i dont im trying to think on the 
gorbachev letter i dont think there was a request for sending 
money and then i also told our soviet partners that we had some 
problems legal problems the settlement of this kerensky debt 
for example before we would be free to give more like direct 
financial support so i wouldnt set a time frame on when and if 
the united states decides to go forward 
but i must say that i hope he will i hope the soviets will 
view this as positive and indeed i have contacted mr gorbachev 
already by cable telling him i want to talk to him about the 
summit and telling him that why i felt that its positive and 
also congratulating him on his landslide win certain readings i 
was doing before then i wasnt sure that it was going to work out 
quite that way but hes in the political arena and he did pretty 
darn well and i congratulated him helen 
q mr president for 40 years weve spent untold billions to 
fight the soviet union is it conceivable as you and secretary 
baker have portrayed that the us american taxpayer would not 
be willing to spend a dime to help them now 
a we are trying to help them now and i think were going to 
send the kind of help that in the long run will be most beneficial 
to them and they need reform and they know it and were going to 
try in every way to facilitate that reform because we are in a very 
different age but we have some problems im not particularly 
enthusiastic about the intercontinental ballistic missiles aimed at 
us cities i find it a little contradictory to think that they will 
continue to spend 5 billion a year for cuba a totalitarian system 
whose leader is swimming against this tide of democracy and freedom 
that is lifting up most hopes in the soviet union so theres 
certain things have to happen before i as president will make 
recommendations for direct financial aid so what were trying to 
do is carry our part of the load in helping the reforms

the united states and its partners at the 
economic summit sidestepped differences on global warming 
wednesday but issued an environmental declaration that emphasized 
forestry protection 
the seven leaders pledged to negotiate an international 
agreement to curb deforestation as expeditiously as possible 
the environmental declaration contained mostly general language 
on global warming and called for an international convention on the 
subject to be completed by 1992 the united nations is already 
working on the issue 
the bush administration prevailed in blocking european wishes to 
specify exactly how much the industrialized nations should reduce 
carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming 
carbon dioxide has been estimated to account for about 55 
percent of global warming but the timing and the degree to which 
the earth is expected to become hotter are uncertain 
west german chancellor helmut kohl said germany had wanted 
tougher commitments in the area of emissions but added we can 
live with the communique 
environmental groups immediately lambasted the summit as having 
failed to produce substantive progress on environmental concerns 
president bush fired back saying he wasnt out to get some 
brownie points from the environmental groups 
he told a news conference that the summit had produced a 
reasoned position not a radical position thats going to throw a 
lot of american men and women out of jobs 
the summit declaration emphasized forestry planks it called for 
immediate negotiations to forge a worldwide forestation program a 
world bank plan to stop destruction of brazils tropical rain 
forests and a toughening of the world banks current tropical 
forestry action plan to emphasize conservation and biological 
diversity 
the destruction of forests has reached alarming proportions 
the summit communique said 
a forestry program could end up helping combat global warming 
eventually because trees absorb the carbon dioxide emissions that 
are contributing to the earths warming scientists say 20 percent 
of global warming is due to deforestation 
kohl said he was pleased about the summit leaders commitment on 
brazilian rain forests the continuing destruction of tropical 
forests must be stopped through an immediate program he said 
the leaders said the forestry agreement should be ready for 
signing by 1992 
the general language of the summit communique stated we as 
industrialized countries have an obligation to be leaders in 
meeting these challenges on climate change ozone depletion 
deforestation marine pollution and the loss of biological 
diversity 
but environmentalists said the seven leaders had abandoned their 
promise at their paris summit a year ago to take decisive urgent 
action on environmental problems 
despite their green rhetoric the g7 leaders leave houston in 
the red on the environment the envirosummit coalition of 
prominent environmental groups said the group welcomed the promise 
of a forestry protection plan however 
the summit is a failure on the environment because they did 
nothing on global warming said dan becker of the sierra club 
in order to cover over their inaction on global warming theyve 
added a fig leaf on rain forests 
on the contentious issue of global warming the communique 
included vague compromise language calling for appropriate 
implementing protocols to stem global warming as expeditiously 
as possible but it was unclear whether such protocols would have 
to wait until after a 1992 convention on global warming 
the bush administration says more research is needed on climate 
change before dramatic steps are taken to curb carbon dioxide 
emissions

a new bedford fishing boat captain who reported 
that his crew was staging a mutiny decided wednesday not to press 
charges authorities suspect the problem was a homesick teenager 
capt gary feener the 30yearold skipper of the barnacle bill 
first called the coast guard tuesday night he said he was locked 
in the pilot house with his first mate fearing for his life 
according to coast guard seaman steve aitkins his seven crew 
members were in a state of mutiny he said 
a halfhour later the captain called saying calm had been 
restored fifty minutes later feener was telling the coast guard 
that his men were tearing up the 73foot vessel armed with knives 
and hammers 
a coast guard cutter steamed out to meet the scalloper and 
reached it at dawn wednesday about 90 miles east of nantucket 
about five armed coast guard officers boarded the boat and the 
cutter escorted it back to shore in nantucket once they arrived 
wednesday morning feener decided he wouldnt press charges and the 
crew was allowed to leave 
nantucket police sgt charles gibson gave eight men and the 
14yearold son of one of them a lift to a ferry that would take 
them to hyannis to go where they pleased 
the crew members were calm and orderly although the captain 
appeared to be upset gibson said 
they said something about the crew wanting to come back to 
port and the skipper not wanting to come back according to 
gibson apparently the 14yearold was on board and wanted to 
return home after three days at sea but the skipper refused and 
thats when the troubled started gibson said

q in your discussions why did germany and other countries 
think its necessary now 
a well germany has some very special interests that we 
understand and were not as i said over in london helen were 
not urging everybody to march in lockstep just as on our programs 
for central america i want to see more help from the g7 and the 
g24 and anybody else who will listen to help the democracies in 
central and south america and theyve got certain priorities and 
i hope they will be able to help in this way but if we go forward 
as we have in assisting nicaragua and panama i dont feel that 
everybody has to move in lockstep on that support for democracy 
brit 
q mr president the final communique here reflecting your 
views in no small part on agricultural subsidies calls upon each 
nation to quote make substantial progressive reductions in 
support and protection of agriculture does this mean sir that 
youre prepared to ask congress to abolish some of the more 
notorious forms of support subsidy that are part of our farm 
program 
a absolutely and we have to do it and its a twoway street 
and i expect there would be some political opposition because like 
many of these countries we protect but i am convinced and i 
believe congress would support the concept that if we all do this 
and we all reduce barriers and we all make a freer trading system 
that the united states can compete but im sure i would have some 
obstacles for certain from the supporters of certain programs 
that have been in existence for a long time but thats a little 
down the road now and i think as far as the ec goes its a little 
down the road so what were trying to do is move the whole thing 
forward without saying that we have to have tomorrow totally 
unprotected trade id like to shoot for that some day ive said 
that before 
q well how soon sir will you be going to congress with a 
legislative package to begin to undo 
a well as soon as we see what progress is made in the gatt 
thats where the next action is is in these talks that are coming 
up i think its just on the 23rd of this month or some time and 
thats thats why i think this language that we worked out and 
that all of you have i think now is encouraging because we all 
know that agriculture has been a major stumbling block and my 
special trade representative carla hills impressed on me the need 
to move that particular category forward and thats why and we 
did get agreement so lets but the next step before we talk 
about needing a legislative package is to get agreement out of the 
gatt kathy 
q mr president if the study delays a decision on aid to the 
soviet union beyond german reunification would it not be expected 
that there would be a lessening of interest in the summit 
countries in helping the soviet union if the german unification 
question is resolved by that time 
a no i think events are changing so fast that different 
countries are going to look at this with slightly different senses 
of priority but in the meantime this study will go forward 
we have sent in a bilateral sense many missions to the soviet 
union alan greenspan was over there on his own weve had dick 
thornburgh over there talking about reordering the helping 
reorder the justice system we have people from the stock markets 
over there weve had a wide array of individuals and groups of 
business people go and so the that process of trying to assist 
in change and in reform is underway bilaterally 
but this look that the imf will coordinate and be done by these 
other agencies will kind of give an official at least for the g7 
we will look at it in rather an official way and then see if we 
can decide on more collective action at the next summit or whether 
we proceed individually on a casebycase basis john and then ann

q mr president on the question of the environment you in 
the past and your chief of staff to say the least too have 
always said that there has not been enough information you needed 
to study more now youre prepared to move particularly on the 
global warming question who twisted your arm what changed your 
mind here 
a well i think were moving forward because we recognize there 
is a problem i thought we called for more data in here but we 
need clearly we need more when you take the nasa study and then 
some people point to that as challenging the concepts of global 
climate change why i think everybody well put it this way 
everybody at this summit agreed that we need needed more 
scientific information but the steps that weve recommended here 
in this communique we can enthusiastically endorse 
and so i think we came out with a reasoned position not a 
radical position thats going to throw a lot of american men and 
women out of jobs and yet weve done an awful lot and i think 
others at the summit recognized it in terms of cleaning up the 
air weve got a proposal and i told them proudly of it to redo 
our clean air act and they were very much impressed with that you 
might have heard 
prime minister mulroneys supportive comments about that so 
theres a lot of things working bilaterally and in terms of 
emissions and i think we have a very reasonable position at this 
point 
q if i can follow 
a yes 
q there seems to be a little wiggle room on co2 are 
you making a clear commitment to do something about it 
a no i wouldnt read anything into the into these texts 
beyond what is actually printed there yes ann 
q i understand it would take some time for the soviet economy 
to reform but are you suggesting when you link soviet aid to arms 
control that you could never imagine any direct aid so long as 
there are any soviet weapons aimed at the west 
a no i didnt say that but im i would really prefer to 
stand on what i have simply said there may the world is changing 
very fast but they know that weve got some big difficulties on 
the regional questions and on the fact that a lot of missiles are 
aimed at the united states but a good way to start in doing 
something about that is to have a successful conclusion on the 
start treaty so i dont want to go beyond where we are right now 
if youd asked me last year at this time if i could have 
predicted the rapidity of change i would have or the changes 
that took place have taken place i couldnt have predicted them 
so i dont know exactly where we will be but i do know that this 
proposal weve made is sound 
q do you think if the imf does say that some direct aid is 
necessary that perhaps that would spur greater arms control 
movement 
a if they say excuse me the imf says what 
q if the imf study suggests that direct aid is appropriate do 
you think that in turn could stimulate or speed up arms control on 
behalf of the soviets 
a i would think i would hope so i would take i think 
gorbachev is committed to a fast track on strategic arms yeah 
john and then well take these 
q on aid to the soviets you keep saying that the american 
people simply arent ready to give cash to gorbachev now if the 
imf comes back with a report gorbachev accepts some of those 
recommendations they cut way back on aid to cuba largely which 
consists of oil shipments after all not money he does these 
things you want are you ready before the 1992 presidential 
campaign to go out there and tell the american people that you 
would send american cash or credits provide credits to gorbachev 
a your question is too hypothetical i cant go into a 
hypothesis like that and well wait and see weve taken a path 
thats based on the facts right now and i would just say that i 
think mr gorbachev understands that at this juncture sending money 
from the united states is not in the cards and he knows what needs 
to be done to change the formula and i like to think hes going to 
try and maybe hell come out of this congress where many predicted 
his demise and feel encouraged to go forward but im not going to 
answer a hypothetical question of that nature

an internal nasa study concludes that 
astronauts will have to spend 75 percent more time spacewalking to 
maintain the space station than previously thought a congressman 
said wednesday 
its going in the wrong direction not the right direction 
rep bill green rny said in a telephone interview 
green the ranking minority member of the appropriations 
subcommittee that oversees nasa spending said his staff had seen 
some of the same gloomy forecasts as the new york times which 
published the results in its wednesday editions 
nasa has said it will make the document public next week along 
with plans to reduce the number of space walks through design 
changes and other means the agency declined requests to make the 
study public immediately 
the space stations top official william b lenoir has 
maintained that the estimates would be high but that the number 
could be cut sharply 
green said the maintenance requirements were only one issue the 
other he said is the limited amount of electrical power that 
appears to be available for microgravity experiments on the station 
nasa plans initially to have 75 kilowatts of power of which 45 
kilowatts will be needed for housekeeping 
green said that if nasa cant bring maintenance under control or 
provide enough power to be useful it might be time to change 
designs 
one has to look at the possibility that if the situation 
continues to deteriorate in terms of safety and the capacity of the 
station there comes a point where we say hey this design is not 
working and maybe go back to the design this country had 
skylab green said 
the skylab program in 1973 and 1974 involved sets of three 
astronauts working inside the orbiting laboratory for periods of 
28 56 and 84 days 
the space station whose cost has more than tripled from the 8 
billion estimate when president reagan proposed it in 1984 is in 
the preliminary design phase a review late this year will lead to 
the start of detailed designs 
a preliminary report in march by a 12member team headed by dr 
william j fisher an astronaut and charles r price a robotics 
engineer found the station would need more than 2200 hours of 
maintenance each year far more than the 130 hours that had been 
budgeted 
the new york times said the final report expects that more than 
3800 hours of spacewalking time would be needed to date 
astronauts have logged 400 hours of space walks each a risky 
exercise 
you cant do it as currently designed the newspaper quoted 
an unnamed engineer you have to build a different station 
green said the space station would be useful for two major 
tasks learning what happens when humans spend extended time in 
space and processing materials in a nearzero gravity environment 
congress is considering a request of 25 billion for the 
station in the next fiscal year the first elements of the station 
are expected to be put into orbit early in 1995 with completion 
some 28 flights later in 1999

one of our most important responsibilities is to pass on to 
future generations an environment whose health beauty and 
economic potential are not threatened environmental challenges 
such as climate change ozone depletion deforestation marine 
pollution and loss of biological diversity require closer and more 
effective international cooperation and concrete action we as 
industrialized countries have an obligation to be leaders in 
meeting these challenges we agree that in the face of threats of 
irreversible environmental damage lack of full scientific 
certainty is no excuse to postpone actions which are justified in 
their own right we recognize that strong growing marketoriented 
economies provide the best means for successful environmental 
protection 
climate change is of key importance we are committed to 
undertake common efforts to limit emissions of greenhouse gases 
such as carbon dioxide we strongly support the work of the 
intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc and look forward 
to the release of its full report in august the second world 
climate conference provides the opportunity for all countries to 
consider the adoption of strategies and measures for limiting or 
stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions and to discuss an effective 
international response we reiterate our support for the 
negotiation of a framework convention on climate change under the 
auspices of the united nations environment program unep and the 
world meteorological organization wmo the convention should be 
completed by 1992 work on appropriate implementing protocols 
should be undertaken as expeditiously as possible and should 
consider all sources and sinks 
we welcome the amendment of the montreal protocol to phase out 
the use of chlorofluorocarbons cfcs by the year 2000 and to 
extend coverage of the protocol to other ozone depleting 
substances the establishment of a financial mechanism to assist 
developing countries to tackle ozone depletion marks a new and 
positive step in cooperation between the developed and developing 
worlds we applaud the announcement in london by some major 
developing countries including india and china that they intend 
to review their position on adherence to the montreal protocol and 
its amendments we would welcome their adherence as a crucial 
reinforcement of the effectiveness of the protocol which would 
ultimately lead to a worldwide phase out of ozone depleting 
substances we urge all parties to ratify the amended protocol as 
quickly as possible to combat desertification expand projects to 
conserve biological diversity protect the antarctic and assist 
developing countries in their environmental efforts we will work 
within unep and other fora to achieve these objectives and will 
participate actively in uneps work to protect bio diversity 
to cope with energyrelated environmental damage priority must 
be given to improvements in energy efficiency and to the 
development of alternative energy sources for the countries that 
make such a choice nuclear energy will continue to be an important 
contributor to our energy supply and can play a significant role in 
reducing the growth of greenhouse gas emissions countries should 
continue efforts to ensure highest worldwide performance standards 
for nuclear and other energy in order to protect health and the 
environment and ensure the highest safety

q let me ask you this you got sort of a delay on aid to the 
soviets because of this study which will not be completed until

nato summit as a victory for george bush across the board whether 
its cutting agricultural subsidies or europeans or whether its 
the environment what didnt you get at this summit that you 
wanted what did you lose here 
a well in the first place i dont im glad to hear that 
but with a laugh i dont i dont i really honestly we 
dont look at it as a victory for one side and a defeat for 
another thats the good thing about this g7 group 
and so there werent any winners or loser in it 
but we there was compromise along the way but again im not 
going to reopen the hard work towards that went into this 
agreement by by saying what we would like to have had that was 
different but control initiatives or matters

bowing to public pressure library 
trustees have reversed their decision to introduce a pg13 card 
that would have confined young people to the childrens area of the 
library 
more than 100 people packed the trustees meeting tuesday to 
protest the card it would have given parents the option of 
restricting their children younger than 14 to the childrens room 
of oak lawn memorial library in suburban chicago 
i was so proud of the people of oak lawn last night beth 
baird of the friends of the oak lawn library said wednesday they 
just came on their own just people who felt deeply about freedom 
and the freedom to read 
even those in favor of keeping the card dubbed pg13 after 
the movie rating system that advises parental guidance for kids 13 
and younger were pleased with the turnout 
i think it was wonderful government in action you couldnt 
ask for anything better said trustee carol james who favored 
keeping the limitedaccess card 
at junes board meeting with three members absent the trustees 
voted 31 to introduce the optional card adult books and the 
reference room which houses encyclopedias and other reference 
books would have been offlimits for children with the card 
tuesday the board voted 43 to rescind the policy 
james said the card had been largely misunderstood she said it 
was intended to give parents the right to choose a library card 
for their children 
they were all there pumped up against censorship james 
said im against censorship that was not the motion that we 
rescinded 
the american library association decried the cards introduction 
as a bad precedent 
kids who read succeed association president richard 
dougherty said after the board suggested the card anything that 
puts barriers in front of that is not good 
residents said they were chagrined by the media attention the 
card attracted 
im deeply ashamed of our library and totally embarrassed 
said resident mary grana before the vote my friends from all 
over are saying oh you live in that nazi village 
as a parent ive always had the choice said kathleen 
miller a resident for 25 years who are you to give me the right 
i already have

q isnt it drawing it a little fine though to say arms 
control yes but soviet aid to the soviets which really there 
were no conditions placed on that could be used for anything 
german aid that could be used for anything isnt that 
a well i dont you may be a little ahead of me on what the 
soviets plan to use the german aid for aid that has not yet been 
forthcoming i understand that chancellor kohl is going to moscow 
i think wheres to staff is that correct within the next 
couple of weeks returning but we dont know that as to what 
conditions will be on the funding and how it will be how itd be 
used in the soviet union 
but i gave him our position he gave me his but thats not 
enough to break up a strong alliance and a very comfortable and 
strong relationship bilateral relationship between the federal 
republic and the united states yeah 
q mr president on the forestry issue there are a number of 
sentences in the declaration talking about the importance of 
preserving forests globally what impact would that have on the 
american domestic field would it for example change the balance 
that your administration has been trying to strike on the issue of 
the pacific northwest forests and the spotted owls there 
a no we are committed to prudent forest management but we are 
also committed to planting a billion trees a year and putting real 
emphasis on reforestation so i dont think theres any 
contradiction some would argue some of the purists in the 
environmental movement that youve got to stop right where we 
are not harvest any lumber at all and some of it would be done in 
protection of the owl and some because theyre opposed to 
harvesting the old growth forests i dont share that view and i 
do think we can find a balance where the net is an increase in the 
numbers of trees yes 
q if i could follow up 
q back on agriculture 
q what response do you have to the people in third world 
countries who argue that youre asking them to make sacrifices on 
their economic development that youre not willing to ask american 
workers to make parallel sacrifices 
a i think we have to find ways to assist those who would take 
that view and i think many of our countries who moved forward and 
did not have great respect for the environment now and now are 
doing a good job on it and i would put the united states in that 
category with pride i might say should find ways to assist 
these countries yes 
q back on agriculture mr president you said that you were 
encouraged about the language on agricultural subsidies could you 
say why specifically when the us gave in on the key question of 
allowing one common measure to be used for all subsidies and also 
on a separate matter could you tell us whether you got any 
commitment for help from your allies on the latin american aid 
initiative 
a not being a technical expert on these highly technical gatt 
negotiations i relied heavily on advice from experts like carla 
hills who is one such an expert and clayton yeutter bob 
mosbacher involved also and these people whove been wrestling 
with the technicalities of the trade question were very pleased at 
the formulation we came up with they felt without such 
formulation the whole successful conclusion of the gatt round was 
at stake but they think that the wording we have that refers 
peripherally to this de zeeuw report and is enough now to move 
the agricultural discussions forward when they when they meet 
soon again 
so and what was the second part i dont know on the others i 
know that some of them have expressed an interest in helping but i 
didnt ask for a collective decision out of the g7 on that 
question yes

portauprince haiti ap a protest strike over the return 
from exile of two former officials linked to human rights abuses 
under dictatorial regimes on wednesday paralyzed this normally 
bustling capital of 1 million people 
meanwhile the independent radio haitiinter reported deposed 
dictator jeanclaude baby doc duvalier had booked a flight to 
haiti for july 29 and that two of his former ministers were 
expected to arrive wednesday night 
duvalier has lived in exile in france since he was ousted in a 
popular uprising in february 1986 
the radio station gave no attribution for the report which 
could not be independently confirmed 
the oneday protest strike was supported by political groups 
labor unions and many civic groups strike supporters expressed 
concern that duvalier supporters were attempting to make a comeback 
in haiti 
downtown shops openair markets and gas stations were closed 
for the oneday protest and no buses were running streets were 
virtually deserted 
employers sent home the few assembly line workers who showed up 
for work at the sprawling industrial park near the airport 
independent radio antilles reported about 15000 people are 
employed there 
reports from caphaitien and gonaives haitis second and 
thirdlargest cities indicated widespread support for the strike 
in the provinces most businesses were closed but buses were still 
running 
there were no reports of violence 
unity assembly a coalition of 12 political groups called the 
strike tuesday after the government failed to comply with its 
demand to arrest two former highranking officials roger lafontant 
and williams regala who returned separately from exile last week 
as interior and defense minister under baby doc duvalier 
lafontant reputedly headed the dreaded tonton macoutes paramilitary 
force duvaliers ouster ended the 29year dynasty founded by his 
father francois papa doc who died in 1971 
regala a retired army major general served as interior and 
defense minister under two previous military regimes he is widely 
regarded as the mastermind of the election day massacre of nov 29 
1987 in which thugs supported by the army shot and hacked to death 
at least 34 voters at polling stations 
lafontant had been living in selfimposed exile in the 
neighboring dominican republic the past 4 years 
regala fled to the united states in march when military ruler 
lt gen prosper avril was forced into exile by a popular uprising 
their return to haiti heightened fears of an organized attempt 
to disrupt general elections scheduled for nov 4 
unity assembly declared in a statement that lafontant and regala 
at large are ill omens of growing insecurity and a slap in the 
face of justice 
in san juan puerto rico paul laortue a senate candidate in 
the aborted 1987 elections said the return of lafontant and regala 
was a very serious test by the duvalierist sector to find out if 
they can make a comeback 
if these two guys can stay in haiti that means that before 
the end of the year jeanclaude duvalier could attempt to come 
back i dont know if he would dare but it would be viable 
said latortue who now teaches at the university of puerto rico 
the unity assembly coalition had given civilian president ertha 
pascaltrouillot until noon tuesday to arrest lafontant and regala 
mrs pascaltrouillot who was appointed president to succeed 
avril made no public statement in response to the protest 
her silence underscored a longstanding rift between the 
president and the 19member council of state which was appointed 
to govern alongside her in a caretaker civilian government 
in a statement monday the council of state said lafontant and 
regala had been widely accused of repeated humanrights 
violations and illicit enrichment 
the council said their return from exile was due to the policy 
of the present executive mrs pascaltrouillot which hasnt 
managed to set the legal process in motion 
an arrest warrant for lafontant issued saturday by government 
prosecutor bayard vincent was not served but the police chief 
col jeanclaude duperval said it would be independent telehaiti 
reported tuesday a second warrant was issued tuesday morning

seven more cubans took refuge 
wednesday at pragues embassy in havana the czechoslovak news 
agency ctk reported bringing the number of cuban asylumseekers to 
14 
czechoslovakia accused cuba of failing to keep additional cubans 
out as promised cuba assailed the embassy staff and said the 
refugees must quit the embassy at once 
five cuban opposition activists sought refuge in the embassy on 
monday walking through the main door apparently without incident 
czechoslovak officials said earlier in prague 
on tuesday two cubans scaled the missions fence and asked 
asylum ctk identified them as igor campana and alejandro r lugo 
they said they were students 
cuban police then cordoned off the street leading to the 
embassy but the seven new arrivals apparently climbed over the 
fence during a power outage in the neighborhood during the night 
ctk said it said they forced their way into the embassy building 
wednesday morning damaging the glass doors 
ctk said the seven penetrated the czechoslovak mission in 
spite of the fact that cuban authorities promised maximum help in 
guarding the building to avoid further complication of the 
situation 
later ctk said cuban police were not at their posts during the 
blackout 
the seven cubans are mostly jobless persons who were not 
active in the opposition this fact gave rise to conjectures that a 
provocation might be involved ctk said without elaborating 
czechoslovakias charge daffaires in havana jan doemoek went 
to the cuban foreign ministry on wednesday to convey pragues 
protest that cuban authorities did not keep their promise not to 
allow any other cubans to enter the mission the state agency 
said doemoek received no explanation it said 
the news agency said cuban officials accused the embassy staff 
of having violated all valid international regulations and 
agreements 
it quoted the foreign ministry as saying the cubans must leave 
the czechoslovak embassy immediately without any preliminary 
conditions 
czechoslovak authorities had said tuesday they were not 
considering turning the cubans over to the authorities 
the two countries were close allies before the democratic 
revolution in czechoslovakia last year swept communists from power

a former roommate of the jogger gangraped and 
beaten almost to death in central park testified wednesday that he 
didnt recognize her when he first saw her after the attack lying 
comatose in a hospital bed 
i looked at her for 10 minutes said patrick garrett 29 
it was actually difficult to identify her as well as i know 
her 
police showed me her ring garrett said i knew it was her 
ring

garrett said he got worried and went to metropolitan hospital on 
april 30 after the woman failed to keep an appointment the night 
before and didnt return a telephone message then failed to show 
up for work or call in

in the park where she had been gangraped and beaten by a pack of 
youths

the senate approved a broad crime bill 
wednesday that stiffens prison terms for savings and loan fraud 
bans nine semiautomatic weapons and makes three dozen federal 
offenses punishable by death 
the electionyear measure sailed through the senate 946 with 
opposition coming largely from critics of capital punishment 
this is the toughest and most comprehensive crime bill in our 
history said judiciary chairman joseph r biden jr ddel he 
said the measure could cost up to 2 billion in 1991 and added the 
source of the funds was uncertain 
at the last minute the senate added 1625 million to combat 
savings and loan fraud and tough prison terms for those convicted 
in the scandal including life for kingpins whistle blowers 
could collect rewards of up to 300000 for turning in sampl looters 
the bill would add hundreds of savings and loan fraud 
investigators and allow the government to seize the assets of sampl 
looters in the same fashion that it now confiscates those of drug 
kingpins 
lawmakers said they have felt distinct pressure from back home 
to step up prosecution of sampl offenders 
we need to be cracking down on the orgy of fraud and 
lawbreaking that occurred in the savings and loan crisis said 
sen patrick leahy dvt 
among the provisions settled earlier was the ban on import or 
domestic manufacture of nine kinds of semiautomatic assault 
weapons approved over the fierce opposition of the national rifle 
association 
senators also had agreed on provisions allowing executions for 
34 federal offenses including treason hostagetaking and 
presidential assassination it is already possible under current 
law to seek capital punishment for drug kingpins who commit murder 
and terrorists who kill americans overseas 
other parts of the crime bill would streamline the appeals 
system with an eye to ending delays of a decade or more in carrying 
out executions tighten money laundering laws and provide for 1000 
new fbi agents 1000 narcotics agents 500 border patrol officers 
and 480 federal prosecutors 
additional features range from an increase in funding for boot 
camp prisons to tougher penalties for sale of the new drug 
ice 
the house currently is fashioning its own version of a 
comprehensive crime bill 
the bush administration has been cool to the senate package 
largely because of its gun features the administration has banned 
import of a number of nonsporting semiautomatic weapons and 
has urged a limit on the size of ammunition clips but opposes a 
ban on semiautomatics manufactured here 
attorney general dick thornburgh issued a statement wednesday 
afternoon however saying he wanted to commend the senate 
action in adopting an amended version of the crime bill with 
most of president bushs proposals to combat crime and institute 
much needed criminal justice reforms 
while there are some provisions of the senatepassed bill that 
the administration opposes i am convinced that with continued 
bipartisan cooperation the 101st congress will help achieve the 
presidents goal thornburgh said 
the senate bill started life as president bushs crime package 
but over the last year was virtually rewritten on capitol hill the 
process has been punctuated by potshots back and forth between bush 
and senate democrats 
as the senate wrapped up its work biden grumbled that he was 
tired of four months of political rhetoric from the 
administration on the crime issue willie horton is back in jail 
figuratively speaking he said the 1988 campaign is over 
horton is a convict who went on a crime rampage after failing to 
return from a weekend furlough bush supporters during the 1988 
presidential campaign made him into a symbol of the need for a 
crackdown on crime 
sen arlen specter rpa said bush had been a powerful 
stimulus to senate action on the issue 
willie horton is still a figure to be reckoned with in america 
and on the senate floor specter said 
the crime bill being fashioned by the house judiciary committee 
contains only minor firearms provisions but a gun bill that 
already has been approved by the panel would outlaw domestic 
weapons that fail to meet the administrations sporting 
purposes test 
gunowner organizations say that bill could be tougher than the 
one approved by the senate they say the plan could possibly be 
added to the house crime bill when it reaches the floor 
despite its vaunted political power the nra was beaten 
repeatedly in the senate in recent months as it tried to rid the 
crime bill of its firearms provisions the heart of the lobbying 
effort was a series of strongly worded mass mailings to homestate 
gun owners 
sponsors of the ban credited their success to lobbying by police 
organizations although the washingtonbased group handgun control 
inc also waged a vigorous campaign 
the effort began in january 1989 after a schoolyard massacre in 
stockton calif carried out by a deranged man with the 
semiautomatic version of the ak47 assault rifle 
under the senate bill the following guns would be banned for 
import or domestic manufacture 
norinco mitchell and poly technologies avtomat kalashnikovs 
including the ak47 action arms israeli military industries uzi 
and galil beretta ar70 sc70 colt ar15 and car15 fabrique 
nationale fnfal fnlar and fnc mac10 and mac11 steyr aug 
intratec tec9 and the street sweeper and the striker

the chairman of a senate panel expressed 
concern wednesday that the pentagon might move ahead on a 7 
billion program to build radar jammers for military aircraft 
without independently testing the system 
in a letter to a top pentagon official sen david pryor 
dark also questioned whether proceeding with the airborne 
selfprotection jammer early next year violates the fiscal 1990 
defense spending bill which prevented the release of funds until 
operational tests are completed 
this acquisition plan could be construed as an endrun around 
the appropriations language pryor wrote in a twopage letter to 
john a betti the pentagons acquisition chief 
pentagon spokeswoman susan hansen said the department had not 
seen the letter and would have no immediate comment she added that 
pentagon officials discussed the program at length during testimony 
before congress in may 
pryor pointed out in the letter that under the current test 
schedule independent navy developmental tests will not begin until 
october and will not be completed until june 1991 
operational tests by the service will not begin until july 1991 
and will not be completed until december 1991 the senator said 
the only test results that will be available to the pentagon 
when officials make their decision on the program will be from the 
contractor 
these contractor tests are not considered independent these 
tests with one exception will not include any of the test areas 
which the aspj the jammer flunked in 198889 navy tests said 
pryor who chairs the senate governmental affairs subcommittee on 
federal services post office and civil services 
the senator has been highly critical of the program which was 
the focus of a may 11 hearing before his panel 
at the hearing the pentagons deputy inspector general derek 
vander schaaf testified that the systems effectiveness was 
unproven and recommended delaying production decisions until tests 
are completed 
the pentagon envisions that the electronic system to be 
installed on more than 2000 navy and air force aircraft would 
increase the survivability of the planes by jamming or deceiving an 
enemys radarcontrolled weapons

q mr president the soviets have already reacted negatively to 
advance word of the part of the communique that said that they 
should reform if they would that reform would help them get 
further aid what would you tell mr gorbachev when you speak to 
him why he should not view this as the allied countries saying 
the cold war is over you lost heres what you have to do here 
are our conditions for integrating you back into western society 
a i think you phrased it well because weve got to be careful 
that we dont send a signal that we dont want to send but i dont 
worry about this one because i sat up there at camp david with mr 
gorbachev in a very frank discussion and told him the problems that 
i have with going forward with financial aid 
ive been quite open about it in the press conference following 
a highly successful nato summit and incidentally i think the 
reaction from the soviet union on the nato summit has been 
extraordinarily positive and so and extraordinarily so and some 
of that i think has been masked by the understandable attention 
given to the g7 meeting here but its been an extraordinarily 
positive and so far i think i think put it this way it just 
totally diminishes the risk of the kind of misunderstanding that 
your question implies 
now you saw the lively debate in the peoples congress it 
looks like our own congress up there yelling at each other and 
debating and calling people names and doing all these frantic 
things so im not saying that somebodys not going to jump up 
having finished trying to fillet gorbachev and jump on me for the 
way the the way weve reacted in this summit 
i am saying that i am not going to have misunderstanding creep 
in because of failure to communicate and indeed ive already sent 
off a communication to mr gorbachev and i will be in touch with 
him personally very soon to discuss this but i dont think theres 
too much of a danger of that yeah 
q if i could follow up in his letter to you in your role as 
host of this summit did he ask for direct cash aid 
a i need help on that but i think not my reaction is that he 
did not ask for that i know he didnt have a price tag on it but 
he listed several categories of places where we could give support 
including credits but let me bob was that a proper answer i 
dont want to response inaudible okay so i was right yeah 
owen 
q some of your colleagues accused you of a double standard mr 
president in supporting language yesterday that opened the door to 
lending to china particularly if it moves toward economic reforms 
and yet taking a much less flexible position regarding the soviet 
union how do you respond to that 
a i respond by saying we already have sanctions on china 
because china has not moved forward far enough on human rights 
those sanctions remain we have offered the hope that if they take 
further steps in the human rights field more can be done 
weve said that we for our well we all of us together 
would consider world bank loans which are which right now are 
discouraged by the g7 consider world bank loans that would 
contribute to the reform of the chinese economy and then i think 
we added a little thing about especially those that would help on 
this world environmental problem 
so my answer to those is that theyre wrong and that the 
pressure is still on and lets hope it will not be 
counterproductive i and i again my position is and i think 
every summit leader there agrees with me every one i believe 
that we should not further isolate china there have been some 
things that we can take some encouragement from 
but we sanction sanctions are on china we took the lead on 
this question a year ago at the g7 summit and some who criticize 
me fail to realize that but i want to see them move forward and i 
want to see restored good relations with china but were not there 
yet

former president jimmy carter said 
wednesday that he was willing to mediate ethiopias 29yearold 
civil war but he expressed concern that northern rebels now may 
favor a military victory 
carter spoke to reporters before leaving addis ababa he came to 
the ethiopian capital for the threeday annual summit of the 
organization of african unity 
carter also said he believed more emergency food supplies could 
be distributed in the droughtstricken north through a recent 
agreement reached by rebels and the government that accord gave 
international aid agencies permission to move supplies from the 
rebelheld port of massawa 
the united nations estimates 45 million of ethiopias 50 
million people face starvation in the north many of those 
imperiled live behind rebel lines 
carter said peace talks between president mengistu haile 
mariams leftist government and the eritrean peoples liberation 
front could resume any time with himself and former president 
julius nyerere of tanzania acting as brokers 
but he added maybe the eritreans believe they can win a 
military victory easier than they can negotiate 
the eritrean rebels and the tigre peoples liberation front are 
fighting separate insurrections and control most of northern 
ethiopia the eritreans in particular control massawa one of two 
red sea ports used for ethiopian trade 
peace talks orchestrated by carter and nyerere broke down last 
month after the guerrillas refused to sit at a negotiating table 
carter told the 26th oau summit on tuesday that africa and its 
550 million people would remain backward and impoverished if civil 
wars continue 
the united nations has sent a team to massawa to gauge prospects 
of using the harbor as a gateway for aid shipments 
in 1986 1 million people died from starvation or related 
illnesses in the worst famine in ethiopias history

canadian prime minister brian mulroney said 
wednesday his economic summit partners were absolutely baffled 
by canadas constitutional crisis 
canadas 1986 plan to grant quebec recognition as a distinct 
society in the canadian federation fell apart last month when the 
newfoundland legislature refused to ratify it raising the 
possibility of a renewed drive for independence by quebec 
mulroney told reporters at a news conference following the close 
of the summit that the other countries were quite surprised 
that such a reasonable approach would not be quickly and 
overwhelmingly approved 
no other nation asked about the status of the canadian 
federation he said but it came up on a procedural point at lunch 
tuesday in response he said he offered remarks that covered the 
waterfront and elicited comments from the others 
he said he told the luncheon that canada without quebec would be 
the relative equivalent in population terms of the united states 
without new york texas and california and they didnt think 
that made a lot of sense 
they are absolutely baffled that any nation in its right mind 
would consider anything other than measures to strengthen its 
unity mulroney said

q can you just say do you believe that financial aid could 
play a role in stimulating reforms in the soviet union 
a well some think that i dont particularly agree with that 
i think when you see the japanese move forward as they plan to 
do to keep a commitment they feel a solemn commitment to china 
for this third yen loan that they feel that way i have great 
respect for prime minister kaifu and i had a long talk with him 
about that and he as you know they plan to move forward 
and just as i cant get all exercised over what chancellor kohl 
does i feel the same way about what prime minister kaifu is doing 
but he feels that the step he is about to take would encourage 
reformers im not sure that hes right in this regard and i think 
that the people in power there can build on the steps that theyve 
taken in a way to satisfy the rest of the people in the g7 that we 
should go back to more normal relations yeah 
q mr president a followup on craigs question in the past 
the united states did call the tune on allied relations with the 
soviet union now that were seeing key allies going their own way 
on aid to the soviet union arent we seeing at least a subtle 
change in the way the united states has to lead the alliance 
arent you having to give a little more leeway to the allies now 
that the cold war is over 
a were dealing in entirely different times earlier on in 
terms of the alliance we had a much more formidable military 
opposition now we see the warsaw pact in almost a state of 
disarray we see troops coming out we see democracies replacing 
totalitarian systems so you have an entirely different era for the 
united states so i we have i think we have very good 
understanding inside the g7 about the soviet union 
but if your question is is it bad or does it alter the us role 
if chancellor kohl for very special reasons goes forward i would 
argue that it does not yes 
q mr president theres a lot of concern over president 
gorbachevs ability to hold onto power does his victory yesterday 
suggest he will be around for a good while despite his serious 
economic problems 
a well i dont know yet but certainly hes surprised a lot of 
us in this room hasnt he and including me who would have 
thought hed have a three to one victory or whatever it was i 
had the figures at the tip of my tongue a while back because it 
was an impressive landslide inside a body where if i had gone by 
you know just some impressions wouldnt have thought hed have 
gotten quite that big a big a landslide so i dont know 
and i think theres some discontent inside the soviet union i 
think hes got enormous problems i hope that what were doing to 
help here will help with those problems but certainly id have to 
leave it there because i couldnt go beyond that and i think if 
you go to experts youll find divisions on that question 
q you dont think the election proves that he has a grip on 
power then 
a well i think it does at this juncture certainly in terms of 
the party and certainly i think the way hes handling his foreign 
affairs is probably getting great credit at home i do understand 
theres consumer concern and that theres that everybody 
including mr gorbachev and mr shevardnadze recognize that they 
have enormous economic problems inside the soviet union john

q mr president on an issue outside the purview of this 
summit your son neil 
a yes 
q your son neil has suggested that the savings and loan 
regulators are conducting something of a vendetta against him 
largely because his last name is the same as yours do you agree 
with that charge 
a i agree that the president ought to stay out of it and that 
the system ought to work and i have great confidence in the 
integrity and honor of my son and beyond that im say no more 
and if hes done something wrong the system will will will 
digest that i have this is not easy for me as a father its 
easy for me as the president because the system is going to work 
and i will not intervene ive not discussed this with any 
officials and suggested any outcome 
but what father wouldnt express a certain confidence in the 
honor of his son and thats exactly the way i feel about it and i 
feel very strongly about it and for those who want to challenge 
it whether theyre in the congress or elsewhere let the system 
work and then we can all make a conclusion as to his honor and his 
integrity 
and its tough on people in public life to some degree and ive 
got three other sons and they all want to go to the barricades 
every one of them when they see some cartoon they dont like 
particularly those that are factually incorrect in total total 
demeaning of the honor of their brother they want to they want 
to do what any other any other kids would do and i say you 
calm down now were in a different role now you cant react like 
you would if your brother was picked on in a street fight thats 
not the way the system works but we have great emotions that i 
share with barbara i share with my sons and my daughter that i 
wont share with you except to say one as president i am 
determined to stay out of this and let it work and let it work 
fairly and secondly i have confidence in the honor and integrity 
of my son and if the system finds hes done something wrong he 
will be the first to step up and do whats right 
q does that same confidence sir extend to william seidman who 
has 
a i am 
q democrats as well as republicans 
a he wouldnt be there if i well i guess i dont know about 
about i was about to say he wouldnt be there if i didnt have 
confidence in him i have confidence in his integrity and his 
honor last question 
q mr president the environmental groups that were very much 
in evidence here dont seem too happy with the results of the 
summit 
a hey they havent seemed happy with me for a long time and 
im not too happy with them and i think their grading system is 
absolutely essentially absurd but whats the question 
q well sir the question is theyre calling your forestation 
initiative a fig leaf to cover up your inaction on the environment 
a second portion of this question is why did you leave bill reilly 
home when last year you brought him to paris when you werent even 
planning to put him in the cabinet 
a yeah last year many of the environmental ministers were 
there and including some of the people you remember that was the 
paris centennial and many from other countries were there as 
well so he was not here for that reason nor were other 
secretaries whose counterparts were not here so that was the 
reason this is predominantly an economic summit but lest anybody 
have any doubt about it bill reilly retains my full confidence and 
my full support i have great respect for him 
what was the rest of your question

q why they call the forestation initiative a fig leaf to 
cover up your inaction on global warming 
a oh i cant look come on im not going to respond to 
those groups that have been attacking us every time we turn around 
and you cannot you cannot appeal i have to be careful because 
there were some reasonable people involved but on the 
environmental extreme they dont want this country to grow 
they dont want and they dont want to take look down the 
road at the human consequence of men and women thrown out of work 
and families put into a whole new state of anxiety and i as 
president have to be concerned about that as well as being a good 
custodian a good steward for the environment 
and so but we cannot govern by listening to the loudest voice 
on the extreme of an environmental movement and i did not rely 
heavily on them for support in getting elected president of the 
united states and im not going to be persuaded that i can get 
some brownie point by appealing to one of these groups or other 
and the attacks that they made on some of my summit partners i 
resent them too because its not just the united states and 
attacking the president its or the policies of the government 
its the attack on some of these other leaders so theyre entitled 
to their opinion their signs can be held just as high as others 
and their rating systems can attract as much or as little attention 
as you care to give them but i am not going to shape the policies 
when i know we have sound environmental policies by the loudest 
voice or the biggest sign and so its theyre welcome to 
houston i hope theyve enjoyed it i hope they feel theyve had an 
opportunity to get their message out 
but i had a little cloakroom conversation with some of the 
participants and i think most of them are disinclined to change 
policies in their countries that they think are sound because of 
some of the statements that i saw and perhaps some that you were 
referring to here 
so id say welcome and well listen and keep trying to do 
better but i am determined that we can find a sound environmental 
path and i think weve found it continue to be good stewards 
for the environment and still have some concern for the working 
man and the working woman in this country and that really is what 
it boils down to when you talk about no growth and im not going 
to talk about no growth for the united states because i feel a deep 
concern about the human equation as well as the environment 
so i was very pleased with the the mood amongst the summit 
leaders as the result of the common ground that we hammered out on 
the environment here 
thank you all very much

harvard university plans to purchase 
about 5 million ecuadoran debt to fund a pioneering scholarship 
program aimed at easing the countrys financial burdens officials 
said wednesday 
its a rather special situation that provides a model that 
could be built on for other countries in similar circumstances 
harvard president derek c bok said 
the elaborate debtforscholarship swap essentially takes a 
loselose situation and turns it into an allaround winner by 
converting a portion of ecuadors 11 billion foreign debt into 
cash for education the coloradosized south american countrys 
debt burden gets reduced its us creditors get rid of bonds they 
fear will never be repaid and harvard gets some of ecuadors top 
scholars 
harvard is the only one i know of doing this said robert h 
scott the schools vice president for finance 
scott worked with ecuadoran vice president luis parodi in 
developing the program the agreement was signed here monday 
heres how it works 
harvard purchases 5 million of ecuadoran debt for 750000 in 
the form of discounted loan certificates from us banks eager to 
remove the loans from their books 
the university then donates the certificates to the fundacion 
capacitar an ecuadoran education fund which can exchange them 
locally at the nations central bank for government bonds worth 50 
percent of the loans face value or about 25 million 
fundacion capacitar then sells the bonds on the securities 
market for 25 million in local currency which is then invested 
in dollardenominated securities that will be used as an endowment 
to support harvard scholarships for about 70 ecuadoran students 
during the next 10 years 
the 100000 to 200000 annual scholarships were expected to 
fund five to eight ecuadoran students at harvard by the fall of 
1991 officials said 
this is a very attractive way to develop a financial base to 
provide for the financial aid costs of students from ecuador 
said bok who has announced he will leave harvard next year after 
20 years as president 
through the debtswap were able to leverage the investment we 
make by several times in order to provide a larger fund 
harvard officials said they plan to discuss creating similar 
programs in other latin american countries 
gerard cassidy a bank analyst with tucker anthony inc in 
boston predicted many commercial lenders would be eager to sell 
their debt in secondary markets even at depressed prices 
its a creative way of solving a very difficult situation 
he said its not a panacea but it shows the kind of 
creativeness that is needed 
such debtswap plans have cropped up in several latin american 
nations in recent years many have been funded by northern european 
and us environmental groups who want to protect rain forests and 
national parks 
the nice thing about these conversions is that they foster 
some social goals that governments havent always been able to 
address because theyve been financially strapped said tom 
fullerton an economist with the wefa group formally wharton 
econometrics of bala cynwyd pa 
the ecuadoran government has in recent years been looking for a 
way out of the debt it accrued in the mid1980s when world oil 
prices dropped and an earthquake severed a transandean pipeline 
through the nation of about 10 million people 
ecuadoran officials are negotiating a debtrestructuring program 
that would could reduce their interest rates or up to 70 percent of 
the principal owed 
fullerton said the scholarship plan was a step in the right 
direction but cautioned that it will dissolve only a fraction of 
ecuadors hefty debt which includes 6 billion owed to foreign 
commercial banks 
the amount that were dealing with is very small compared with 
total ecuadoran debt overseas he said but it addresses an 
important social goal and will help improve the human capital 
available in ecuador

the company that built faulty mirrors on the 
hubble space telescope also gave a subcontractor reversed drawings 
for hubble guidance parts in 1981 according to government 
documents obtained by the associated press 
the backward blueprints drawn by prime contractor perkinelmer 
corp forced the company in 198182 to pay the same subcontractor 
to rebuild a hubble tower assembly part used to aim the telescope 
lewis rinker deputy nasa inspector general said the tower 
assembly guidance system did not cause the blurred focus on the 
telescopes mirrors but the faulty engineering plans for the 
guidance part were drawn during the same period when the danbury 
conn company was grinding and polishing the defective hubble 
mirrors 
the disclosure came in an audit released to the ap under the 
freedom of information act it is the first public indication that 
nasa knew nearly a decade ago of problems in perkinelmers 
engineering work 
errors by perkinelmer now known as hughes danbury optical 
systems corp also allowed the assembly part subcontractor 
composite optics inc of san diego calif to make a profit of 
more than 63 percent rebuilding the assembly part according to a 
1988 audit by nasas inspector general 
normal nasa contracts have a 10 percent to 15 percent profit 
nasa auditors consider profits over 25 percent to be excessive 
the audit also criticized perkinelmer and other nasa prime 
contractors for awarding subcontracts without competitive bids and 
for overpaying some subcontractors 
hughes danbury spokesman thomas arconti said wednesday the 
company was in the process of obtaining a complete copy of the 
inspector general report and will have no specific comment on it 
until we review it 
the 1988 audit and two others released tuesday night also 
concluded 
the purchasing system at perkinelmer which makes key spy 
satellite equipment failed to meet defense department standards in 
february 1987 rinker said that should have triggered closer 
supervision of all its government contracts he said the pentagon 
found the company was not properly justifying nobid subcontracts 
or analyzing subcontractor costs 
acting just before auditors arrived in 1987 nasa belatedly 
approved some perkinelmer subcontracts issued between 1981 and 
1985 
four of 17 lockheed missile and space co subcontracts on the 
hubble exceeded normal profit margins rinker said lockheed was 
seeking refunds but has not obtained any 
perkinelmer sided with a subcontractor whose labor cost 
estimates were challenged by defense department auditors as a 
result the subcontractor made a profit of more than 26 percent 
instead of 15 percent called for in the subcontract 
the taxpayers may have paid for up to 108000 a year in 
personal longdistance telephone calls by workers at the hubble 
ground station at johns hopkins university 
nasa may have overpaid incentive bonuses by 1 million to 
perkinelmer and lockheed between 1977 and 1987 on the hubble 
telescope because of the way cost overruns were allocated 
the 1988 audit found that six of 11 perkinelmer subcontracts on 
the hubble had profits greater than 15 percent the auditors 
calculated that five of those subcontracts produced a total of 
98000 in excess profits they recommended nasa seek refunds for 
that money 
rinker said in an interview that hughes danbury had been seeking 
refunds from the subcontractors but so far nothing has been 
returned to the government 
its difficult to get money back from the subcontractor on 
fixedprice contracts unless there was defective pricing rinker 
said citing the second composite optics subcontract rinker said 
we expect not to be charged twice for the same part 
perkinelmer ordered the guidance part from composite optics in 
july 1981 
however during assembly at the perkinelmer facilities it 
was discovered that the prime contractor had furnished composite 
optics engineering drawings in reverse of what was needed the 
auditors found 
the audit said composite optics acknowledged it salvaged a 
significant portion of the backward guidance part but the 
auditors said perkinelmer did not make any reductions to the

a ukrainian protege of mikhail s gorbachev was 
elected wednesday to be his righthand man in the communist party 
the tass news agency reported in a stinging rebuff to the partys 
leading traditionalist 
vladimir ivashko the man gorbachev picked to run the ukrainian 
republic last fall was elected to the post of deputy general 
secretary of the communist party by delegates to the 28th party 
congress tass reported citing trustworthy sources 
ivashko defeated politburo conservative yegor k ligachev who 
has been gorbachevs most vocal hardline critic ivashko has been 
a member of the partys ruling politburo since december 
in its brief report tass did not give any vote totals from the 
secret ballot held wednesday night the results were to be 
officially announced on thursday at the congress 
ivashko a 58yearold economist and engineer will run the 
partys daytoday affairs gorbachev who was reelected as party 
leader on tuesday had sought a protege to handle those tasks while 
he concentrates on his presidential duties 
ivashkos election gave gorbachev a further triumph at the 
congress it showed his personal strength at a congress that has 
been dominated the past nine days by conservatives who have 
criticized his reforms 
it was also a personal repudiation of ligachev on tuesday 
moscow party boss yuri prokofiev told reporters that he thought 
ligachevs political career was over 
meanwhile about 500 anticommunist demonstrators rallied on the 
edge of red square and shook their fists in the face of departing 
delegates one man spat at a delegate and police had to hold back 
many of the protesters who whistled derisively or shouted 
shame and resign 
communism go away said maya ivanova who described herself 
as a supporter of boris n yeltsin the reform president of the 
russian republic 
the crowd which waved czarist flags and anticommunist placards 
such as communism is worse than aids listened to speakers 
through a megaphone that didnt always work scores of uniformed 
police kept protesters off the cobblestones of red square and 
undercover agents milled at the rallys edges speaking into 
plastic bags that concealed their walkietalkies 
the vote between ivashko and ligachev gave delegates a clear 
choice between giving gorbachev a loyal deputy or saddling him with 
a rival in charge of daytoday party affairs a third candidate 
leningrad professor anatoly dudaryev also was on the ballot 
ligachev who eight days earlier had been applauded by the 
largely conservative congress for his harsh criticism of 
gorbachevs policies almost didnt make it onto the ballot for the 
no 2 job 
hours after nominations had closed gorbachev told the congress 
that the rules required a final vote certifying the ballot several 
delegates promptly rose to complain that ligachev did not truly 
support gorbachevs reform program 
the congress then voted 2293 to 1916 to drop ligachev from the 
ballot 
but other delegates immediately objected one argued that the 
congress was the partys ruling body and could change its own 
rules so the group voted 2349 to 1816 to ignore the ballot 
certification requirement and restore ligachevs candidacy 
afterward delegate dr svyatislav fyodorov said he believed 
gorbachev engineered the incident ligachev told reporters it 
was just a procedural question dont look for politics in it 
ligachev also fought off a bid from the floor to prevent him 
from running because of his age ligachev is 69 and two efforts to 
require the deputy leader to be younger than 60 and then 65 both 
failed 
ligachev who stumbled badly when speaking to delegates and 
frequently forgot questions told delegates he had worked well with 
gorbachev he spoke against allowing private property in the soviet 
union 
gorbachev chose ivashko to run the ukraine the soviet unions 
secondlargest republic when party traditionalist vladimir v 
shcherbitsky retired last fall 
it is important that these two people be close gorbachev 
said of the two top party leaders 
as much as i have before no matter what my job i will be 
working for perestroika pledged ivashko we have to do 
everything to renew the party and change its priorities 
we have to understand that without us without the party 
nothing will be left of perestroika he said in a forceful 
presentation to the delegates 
ivashko resigned the party leadership of the ukraine this spring 
after he was elected president of the republic he offered his 
resignation as the ukraines president wednesday the tass news 
agency said 
the ukrainian parliament had urged all of its members to return 
to the ukraine for a key decision on the republics sovereignty 
many including ivashko were at the party congress 
tass quoted ivashko as saying that he was offering to resign 
because he felt a lack of support from parliament

six weeks of hot dry weather have seared 
corn soybean cotton and tobacco crops in the southeast but farm 
experts looked hopefully for weekend rains that could avert an 
agricultural disaster 
karl harker an agricultural meteorologist with the national 
weather service at auburn university in alabama said a low 
pressure system will move into the region as early as thursday 
increasing the likelihood of showers and thunderstorms 
my farm is on irrigation but our water supply is gone said 
albert johnson who owns a 53acre farm in south carolina the 
extreme heat is making tobacco do things that ive never seen 
before the tobacco is literally baking 
georgia agriculture commissioner tommy irvin said without 
significant rain in the next two weeks farmers could face their 
worst disaster since the 1986 drought 
were at a crossroads he said if it doesnt improve we 
stand to be worse than then 
irvin said farmers need a break in the heat and two or three 
days of light showers to soak the ground 
harker said 30day rainfall totals in georgia are running 2 to 6 
inches below normal 
the weather service said north carolina averaged 125 inches in 
june instead of the usual four inches 
south carolina has shortfalls of two to five inches according 
to the southeast regional climate center in columbia sc 
the centers director john purvis said tennessee also has been 
dry nashvilles shortfall is 914 inches since jan 1 
irvin said the drought has severely damaged georgias corn crop 
has killed soybean plants and is expected to substantially reduce 
cotton yields 
it has also lowered milk production forced farmers to feed 
their cattle hay normally reserved for winter has lowered egg 
production and has reduced the weight of chickens 
south carolina officials said corn tobacco and soybeans have 
been hardest hit 
joe burns a crop specialist with the university of tennessee 
agricultural extension service estimated that farmers in eastern 
tennessee are losing about 400000 bushels of corn a day or about 
1 million a day because of the drought 
tobacco the main cash crop in eastern tennessee have virtually 
stopped growing said charles farmer an extension service 
economist 
its an iffy situation farmer said i think we can still 
make some good crops if we get some moisture pretty soon but 
obviously we have lost some ground 
north carolinas tobacco crop is protected by irrigation on most 
farms but corn has withered in some fields officials said most 
of the states 125 million acres of corn is in the hardhit 
eastern part of the state 
columbus county extension director garland mcmullen said farmers 
in his county will lose about half their corn 
we have some areas the farmers will not be able to harvest 
at all he said theres no ears on the stalk 
carl cross a statistician with the north carolina agriculture 
department in raleigh said only an eighth of the states corn crop 
was rated good this week compared to onethird last week

when ukrainian coal miners learned at a 
rally wednesday their republics president might be moving to a top 
communist party post in moscow they cheered and applauded 
it was not happiness for a local boy making good it was more 
pleasure at the prospect of getting rid of vladimir ivashko 
hes a windbag he doesnt do anything said anatoly 
berezhnikov one of about 3000 angry miners demonstrating in the 
heart of the ukraines coal fields during a oneday strike to press 
demands that the communist party get out of their lives and the 
soviet government resign 
ivashko defeated fellow politburo member yegor ligachev for the 
no 2 communist party job in a vote wednesday night at the 28th 
party congress in moscow the official tass news agency reported 
ivashko a protege of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev will 
run the partys daytoday affairs in his new post as deputy 
secretary general this will allow gorbachev to concentrate on his 
duties as soviet president dispute with the republics parliament 
ivashko also offered his resignation as ukrainian president 
wednesday in a dispute with the republics parliament 
miners here in the soviet unions biggest coalproducing region 
admit they dont know ivashko well because he has been in the 
ukrainian leadership only since last fall 
but still they cast him as a part of the communist party and 
government apparatus that has failed to improve their living and 
working conditions 
have you been around to the stores the 34yearold 
berezhnikov who has spent 13 years in the mines asked a reporter 
interested in his view of ivashko without awaiting an answer he 
offered theyre empty 
the cigaretttesmoking miner said ivashkov must share the blame 
along with the rest of the republics leaders the officials he 
said are fighting for power and doing nothing for us 
but there was a dissenter in the crowd the wife of a miner said 
she respects ivashko and thinks it will be a loss for the ukraine 
if he moves to moscow 
you can sense his knowledge hes not stupid and has common 
sense he knows how to assess things and propose what is needed 
said the woman who would identify herself only as ludmilla 
ivashko a 58yearold economist and engineer is much more 
closely identified with gorbachev than the former ukrainian leader 
vladimir shcherbitsky a party traditionalist 
speaking to the party congress on wednesday ivashko pledged 
total support for gorbachevs policies 
organizers of the oneday national miners strike said they 
werent happy with any of the proposed candidates for the no 2 
party job 
ligachev and ivashko are from the same regime theres no way 
we can support him yuri makarov a donetsk strike organizer 
told a news conference 
another organizer yuri boldyrev said the miners had all but 
given up on the party 
we dont have hope for a party headed by either ligachev or 
ivashko he said

mayor david dinkins told the democratic party on 
wednesday it wont be disappointed it chose his city for its 1992 
national convention 
we wont let you down dinkins told democratic national 
chairman ronald brown an old friend new york is a great 
convention town 
brown came to new york after announcing in washington that his 
hometown was chosen as the convention site the gathering should 
bring 35000 delegates guests and journalists to town and pump an 
estimated 100 million into the citys economy 
democrats will nominate the next president of the united 
states two years from now this week in americas most dynamic city 
and in one of the worlds greatest cities new york the big 
apple brown said 
the race to be that nominee is wide open but one possibility 
gov mario cuomo was on hand for the hoopla at city hall cuomo 
added his signature to a contract signed by dinkins and brown then 
parried reporters questions about national office 
i have no plans to run for president cuomo said i have 
no plans to make plans he continued adding with a laugh you 
guys dont believe me its too bad 
political experts say new yorks selection as host would help a 
cuomo candidacy only in the unlikely event the convention is 
contested 
i dont think it matters where the convention is because 
thats the end of the process said former iowa democratic party 
chairwoman bonnie campbell certainly it makes it easier for the 
governor if hes our nominee he wont have to travel as far 
at a flagbedecked city hall dinkins and brown sat at a desk 
that belonged to george washington and a band played happy days 
are here again 
the two men engaged in some republicanbashing stressing the 
savings and loan bailout 
dinkins said 500 billion was being spent to bail out the ailing 
thrifts adding we must not ask honest borrowers and businesses 
to bail out the savings and loan stockholders the big depositors 
and in many cases the same crooks and thieves who caused this 
mess in the first place 
he said he hoped the 92 convention would be a time to renew 
americas progressive values and principles 
brown said the sampl crisis lay in the laps of president bush and 
former president reagan 
it happened on their watch he said its the fox and the 
chicken coop with no prosecution of the thieves 
brown said he was considering several format changes for the 
convention including cutting it to three days from four and 
holding it on a weekend instead of midweek 
the site selection committee had narrowed its search to new york 
and new orleans brown said new orleans chances were hurt by the 
louisiana legislatures passage of strong antiabortion 
legislation but said that was not the deciding factor 
new yorks early pledge to come up with more than 20 million to 
get madison square garden ready for the convention and a promise 
by prominent democratic fundraisers here to fill the partys 
coffers helped persuade brown the big apple was the place to go 
new york played host to the convention in 1976 when jimmy 
carter was nominated and won the presidency and in 1980 when 
carter was renominated and lost

spurned by the democrats who chose new york 
city to host their 1992 national convention new orleans officials 
wednesday said they would try to get the republicans 
mayor sidney barthelemys chief of staff terry alarcon said 
republican officials on tuesday asked new orleans to start working 
on a proposal to play host to the 1992 gop convention 
they said we set the standard in 1988 when the republican 
convention was held at the louisiana superdome alarcon said 
economists estimated the 1988 convention pumped up to 130 
million into the new orleans economy for weeks new orleans had 
been battling new york for the 1992 democratic do 
alarcon and steve hand who led the new orleans campaign said 
new york edged out their city because the democrats want the big 
apples access to bigmoney individuals and corporations both have 
been in relatively short supply in new orleans since the oil 
industry declined in the early 1980s 
we feel like new york won based on one very simple reason 
said alarcon it is the financial capital of this nation 
in washington wednesday democratic chairman ron brown said a 
factor but not the deciding factor was the lousiana legislatures 
recent passage of the toughest sta divisions some unions would accept women 
as pastors but 
indications are that the majority of unions do not find this 
acceptable 
the delegates vote against ordaining women is binding on all 
congregations within the church 
a vote to close off the debate wednesday morning prevented 45 
delegates from taking their turns at the microphone 
during tuesdays twohour debate many of those supporting the 
ordination of women referred to ellen g white an early church 
leader thought by some seventhday adventists to be a prophet 
we need to liberate the holy spirit to do his work with 
whomever he chooses to do his work with said stella greig 
representing andrews university in berrien springs mich if god 
can ordain women as ellen white told us he did her i cannot see 
why the seventhday adventist church cannot also ordain women 
delegates opposing the ordination of women relied on the bible 
which provides the guiding principles for the 127yearold church 
gabriel boakyedankwa of the churchs african division urged 
other delegates to resist social pressures 
the bible is silent on the ordination of women the writings 
of ellen g white are silent on the ordination of women and we 
should also be silent boakyedankwa said if it is in the 
bible we want it if it is not in the bible this church must 
reject it

the syrian foreign minister said 
wednesday that israeli air raids into lebanon had complicated 
negotiations for the release of one of the 16 western hostages held 
by lebanese moslem groups 
in lebanon a senior hezbollah official called for the release 
of all western hostages and lebanese detainees held by israel 
reiterating the proiranian groups standard posture that it is not 
involved in kidnappings 
syrian foreign minister farouk alsharaa was the first official 
to confirm a weekend report by irans official news agency that a 
hostage most likely a european might be freed soon syria is the 
main powerbroker in lebanon 
most of the six american and 10 european hostages are believed 
held by proiranian zealots operating under the umbrella of 
hezbollah or party of god 
sharaa said the israeli raids sunday and monday against 
hezbollah bases in southern lebanon had undermined our efforts 
to secure the release of a hostage at least 15 people died in the 
raids 
there was no immediate reaction by the israeli government to 
syrias remarks 
the syrians were instrumental in the release of us hostages 
robert polhill on april 22 and frank reed on april 30 both were 
freed in lebanon and immediately taken to neighboring syria before 
going on to the united states 
syria maintains 40000 troops in lebanon under an arab league 
peacekeeping mandate from 1976 a year after lebanons 
christianmoslem civil war began the syrians control west beirut 
and moslem regions 
the israeli air raids into lebanon have complicated the issue 
and undermined our efforts said sharaa 
the remaining western hostages in lebanon are six americans and 
10 europeans four britons two west germans two swiss an 
irishman and an italian 
we ask all those holding the hostages and those holding our 
detainees as well to release them said mohammed yazbed a member 
of hezbollahs higher command 
we are against such operations kidnappings and support the 
freedom of individuals he said in baalbek lebanon at the 
funeral of two hezbollah members killed in israels last air raid 
monday 
hezbollah officials often have made such statements in their 
effort to distance themselves from the kidnappings but western 
intelligence sources insist hezbollah is an umbrella for 
underground factions holding most of the hostages 
syria iran and allied palestinian and lebanese factions contend 
that western support of israel encourages the jewish states 
attacks against arabs 
sharaa said in damascus that he had no tangible developments to 
report but it is not unlikely that situation would change soon 
he indirectly confirmed speculation in beirut london and dublin 
that the hostage to be released is irish educator brian keenan 
syria is in constant contact with iranian government officials 
and we are also in contact with the irish government sharaa 
said we are exerting efforts and we hope that these efforts will 
be successful 
asked when a release might take place sharaa said i cant 
tell you anything now 
he did not elaborate on the snags that followed the air raids 
but said i hope we will overcome these difficulties 
keenan 39 was kidnapped in moslem west beirut on april 11 
1986 as he walked from his home to the american university of 
beirut where he taught english 
a native of belfast keenan also holds a british passport 
in beirut shiite sources said this week iran was pushing hard 
for the release of a hostage to express appreciation for relief 
supplies it received from the west after the devastating earthquake 
june 21 
ireland sent one of the first relief shipments to tehran after 
the disaster in which 40000 people were killed 60000 injured and 
about half a million were left homeless 
we continue to be very hopeful about the possible release of 
keenan said irish ambassador declan connolly 
he spoke to reporters after a meeting at the foreign ministry 
with one of sharaas senior aides nasser qaddour 
connolly flew in from saudi arabia on tuesday on arrival he 
said he had come to damascus to keep in closer touch with syrian 
officials to assess developments in a possible hostage release 
we are hopeful on behalf of the irish hostage brian keenan 
he said noting that he had good reason to expect a release 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani has been trying to end the 
ordeal of the hostages in return for improved relations with the 
west 
but he faces growing opposition by iranian radicals who believe 
restoring ties with the west contradicts the teachings of the late 
founder of the islamic republic ayatollah ruhollah khomeini

energy secretary james watkins said wednesday 
his department will take more direct control of the contaminated 
hanford nuclear reservation as part of a plan to clean up problems 
at the nations nuclear weapons program 
we are changing the way of doing business at one of our major 
facilities this is the first of a number of shoes to drop 
watkins said at a news conference 
in addition to taking a greater government role in managing the 
hanford site at washington state watkins said the energy 
department will enter a new agreement with the army corps of 
engineers on thursday to help clean up radioactive wastes at the 
nations nuclear weapons plants 
watkins said he was extremely disappointed with the 
condition of the nuclear weapons plants when he initiated a 30year 
cleanup plan about 18 months ago 
it was a shock to me i had no idea we had not learned the 
lessons of three mile island he said now is the time to pay 
the piper and clean up 40 years of waste 
the department announced last week it was increasing its 
estimate of the cleanup costs nationally to nearly 30 billion over 
the next five years 
watkins said wednesday the boost was due partly to budget 
officials who fear they will be subject to lawsuits if they dont 
ask for enough cleanup money and partly to the discovery of 
additional contamination 
watkins said the work one official currently performs at hanford 
will be handled by three deputies under his new management plan 
including one who will be directly responsible for waste cleanup 
also under the new plan the new site manager john wagoner will 
report directly to the director of the departments office of 
environmental restoration and waste management wagoner deputy 
manager of the savannah river facility the past two years replaces 
hanford site manager mike lawrence who resigned last week to take 
another job 
now we will have direct reporting from one of our major 
sites watkins said 
the hanford site along the columbia river near richland wash 
contains 600000 cubic yards of radioactive waste watkins said 
disclosures in recent years show that dangerous contaminants 
were released directly into the air water and soil 
watkins said the energy department which oversees the nations 
nuclear weapons plants is trying to upgrade plant operations by 
adding workers and administrators directly charged with improving 
of safety 
we need people in the plant walking looking being sensitive 
to the health issues on a sevenday a week 24hour a day basis 
he said none of thats been done in the past that is one of the 
reasons weve been targeted and targeted so successfully by groups 
who have legitimate complaints against us 
watkins said details of the memo of understanding with the army 
corps of engineers will be made available on thursday he said more 
specific plans for the agreement at hanford are expected over the 
next week with other sitespecific plans to follow in the future

about 200 armed mohawk indians wearing war 
paint fought off a police assault wednesday in a dispute over plans 
to expand a private golf course surrounded by tribal land one 
officer was killed 
provincial police officers in helmets fatigues and gas masks 
exchanged hundreds of rounds of bullets with the indians and fired 
tear gas and stun grenades during a battle over several hours 
police later retreated and both sides remained behind barricades 
in a standoff the indians patrolled the edge of the disputed golf 
course in stolen carts in preparation for another attack 
on tuesday oka mayor jean ouellette had asked police to 
intervene to enforce a court injunction ordering the removal of a 
mohawk barricade set up three months ago on the access road to the 
disputed land 
the reason we moved was because the mohawks were breaking the 
law police spokesman richard bourdon said they were blocking 
a public road and this is a criminal act 
mohawk tribe members reacted angrily to the police attack 
i find it awful that police would attack our people said 
tribe member eleanor montour 67 
were not savages were proud to be mohawks we were pushed 
around for centuries and were being pushed again and were getting 
awfully tired of it 
the dispute centers on land owned by the town of oka since 1947 
the indians have always maintained it is their land and their 
kahnesetake settlement surrounds it 
oka 18 miles west of montreal rents the land to the operators 
of the private ninehole course the operators say they want to cut 
down the white pine forest on the land and expand the course to 18 
holes 
quebecs public security minister sam elkas insisted neither he 
nor any other government official knew that provincial police were 
headed to oka he said the police intervened at the request of oka 
municipal authorities 
after the police warned oka officials of the possible 
consequences the police then asked the mohawks to leave the 
barricade elkas said 
they refused at that point we went in to remove them and 
gunshots were fired elkas said 
quebec premier robert bourassa blamed the violence on the 
mohawks 
what we saw this morning was revolting and intolerable said 
bourassa 
we cannot accept the use of violence under any pretext and 
even less so when the use of such violence is directed at those 
whose aim is to uphold the law he said 
but mohawk spokesman harvey nicholas said the indians were just 
returning fire after police began shooting 
they can shoot us down like animals but we cant shoot 
back nicholas said people are getting killed because boys 
want to run around and play golf 
earlier this week john ciaccia the minister responsible for 
native affairs pleaded with the oka town council to put its plans 
for the golf course expansion on hold 
about 100 police officers in helmets fatigues and gas masks 
moved into the area at about 530 am wednesday shots were fired 
and tear gas was lobbed into the mohawk encampment near the 
barricade but nobody was hurt 
after bringing up heavy equipment and placing snipers in trees 
around the barricade police staged an assault about 9 am with 
automatic weapons stun grenades and more tear gas 
cpl marcel lemay 31 was shot in the face and was declared 
dead about an hour later at nearby st eustache hospital 
about 200 armed mohawks wearing war paint and covering their 
faces with bandannas fought the police assault from the barricade 
they were joined by about 100 women and children from the 
1000member kahnesetake community 
the crackle of hundreds of rounds of gunfire was punctuated by 
the thud of tear gas and stun grenades detonating just outside oka 
as the wind moved tear gas back across their lines police 
retreated toward oka and the situation turned into a standoff 
the indians took advantage of the retreat to seize four police 
cars and two vans then used a commandeered frontend loader to 
crush the vehicles to form a barricade on a hill across the main 
highway through the region their position overlooked a police 
roadblock at the bottom of the hill 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney in houston for the 
summit of the western industrial powers said he understood the 
matter was being properly handled by the authorities in quebec 
i have instructed my colleagues in ottawa to make sure all 
proper assistance is offered to the provincial authorities in 
quebec to bring the matter to a successful conclusion he said 
in a show of support for the indians armed mohawks from the 
kahnawake reserve south of montreal used pickup trucks and other 
vehicles to set up roadblocks on two main highways leading to the 
mercier bridge blocking thousands of residents on the south shore 
of the st lawrence river from getting to their jobs in montreal 
three mohawk men were arrested after they tried to flee a police 
patrol in the area a police officer was slightly injured after he 
grabbed the door handle of the indians truck and was dragged for

east german beer brewers and farmers 
temporarily blocked west german border crossings with their trucks 
wednesday to protest what they said is unfair competition from the 
west 
the government meanwhile threatened to close retail stores to 
stop price gouging by former stateowned businesses now feasting on 
the nations new free market 
the government said it would take tough measures to break up the 
retail monopolies that have been charging arbitrarily high prices 
in the country since it shifted to a market economy on july 1 
east germany merged its economy with west germanys on that date 
and began using the west german mark as its official currency 
former stateowned grocery and gas station chains that once sold 
goods at governmentset levels have raised many prices 
dramatically some of them even higher than in wealthy west germany 
government spokesman matthias gehler said west german food 
retailers agreed to send mobile shops with their goods to 
compete against the east german firms 
the government last week said it would break up the chains by 
selling individual stores 
the cabinet of prime minister lothar de maiziere on wednesday 
issued an order saying that employees of the giant ho grocery and 
retail chain would have the first opportunity to buy those stores 
de maiziere toured two grocery stores in east berlin and 
threatened to close shops and levy fines on stores guilty of price 
gouging 
he also criticized the fact that only 15 percent of the goods 
sold in the stores he visited were produced in east germany the 
rest were western products 
my impression confirms the reports ive read he said we 
will see what we can quickly do about this 
east germanys beer brewers blocked a west german border points 
in the southwest corner of the country for about 30 minutes 
creating huge traffic snarls the east german news agency adn said 
it said the domestic brewers have lost 90 percent of their 
business since east germany opened its doors to western products on 
july 1 
rainer doetsch head of the castle brewery accused west german 
brewers of dumping their beer in east germany at belowmarket 
prices 
meanwhile farmers in the agricultural heartland of the north 
blocked a main highway leading to the west german border with 
scores of tractors and trucks adn said 
farmers say the refusal of east german retailers to stock their 
goods in favor of west german products is denying them a chance to 
compete 
many east german retailers have signed agreements with west 
german grocery chains that prevent them from stocking many east 
german goods in their stores

attorney general dick thornburgh on wednesday 
angrily denied suggestions by some civil rights leaders that the 
justice department has targeted black politicians for prosecution 
we are prosecuting people on the basis of whether or not there 
is legally admissible evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt 
their wrongdoing regardless of race religion or color or political 
affiliation thornburgh said 
the attorney general expressed disappointment that benjamin l 
hooks executive director of the naacp had accused federal 
prosecutors of targeting washington mayor marion barry and other 
black officials while ignoring savingsandloan fraud by rich 
whites 
thornburgh told reporters at a luncheon that he had spoken to 
hooks privately about the criticism that the civil rights leader 
had previously leveled at the justice department 
apparently his public response is to simply repeat these 
allegations as he did earlier this week thornburgh said it 
disappointed me that he did 
hooks in an interview with the washington post charged that 
overzealous prosecutors had spent millions of dollars pursuing such 
black politiicans as barry while ignoring those lying conniving 
thieving savings and loan officials who robbed this country blind 
rep john conyers dmich voice a similar charge that black 
public officials were targeted for prosecution last spring when 
thornburgh testified before the house judiciary committee 
that would be a pretty hard message to sell to former gov 
arch moore a white republican who is now facing a long time in the 
slammer said the attorney general 
the former west virginia governor was sentenced this week to 
nearly six years in prison for mail fraud extortion filing false 
income taxes and obstruction of justice 
thornburgh said the department did not have any figures to rebut 
the contention of black commentators that prosecutors spent 
millions of dollars to obtain the drug possession and perjury 
indictment of barry who is now on trial here 
how can you put a price tag on justice our investigations 
cost whatever it takes to get a conviction thornburgh said 
asked what steps he was taking to counter the perception that 
black public officials are being singled out thornburgh said i 
dont know how you address false perceptions other than by inviting 
people to look at the record 
the record clearly indicates there is no such pattern of 
prosecution he said 
the attorney general said the department does not compile 
statistics on the race religion or political affiliation or 
criminal defendants that he contended would rebut the charges 
do you think it would make any difference he said 
of 21 congressmen convicted of crimes relating to their conduct 
in office since 1976 only one was black according to a list 
provided later in the day by the justice department former rep 
charles diggs dmich was convicted of payroll padding

artists intellectuals and students said 
wednesday they would end their sitdown strike only if the 
government agrees to work under a new president with no links to 
the communists 
the strikers camping in scores of tents dubbed the city of 
truth forced the resignation last friday of president petar 
mladenov a former leading member of the governing socialist party 
which is the renamed communist party 
the main opposition alliance the 16party union of democratic 
forces has indicated it would nominate petar dertliev the 
respected 74yearold leader of the social democratic party as the 
udf presidential candidate 
but the leader of another influential party within the udf said 
wednesday he opposed dertlievs candidacy 
milan drenchev leader of the opposition agrariannikola petkov 
party charged the social democrats harbor many former communists 
drenchevs reasoning for rejecting dertliev contradicts 
dertlievs own account of his hardships under the communists 
earlier this year dertliev said that as a social democratic 
party activist he had spent 10 years in prison for his political 
activities after the communist takeover 
drenchev ruled out a candidacy for himself 
according to bulgarian newspapers and analysts other possible 
candidates may be zhivko stalev head of the central electoral 
commission and blagovest sendov president of the academy of 
sciences both are considered unaffiliated 
the socialists won an absolute majority of 211 of parliaments 
400 seats in last months multiparty elections the udf garnered 
144 mandates 32 of which went to the agrariannikola petkov party 
drenchev said 
the student demonstration which began about a month ago was 
seen as significant because it has been joined by top scientists 
and professors including representatives of the bulgarian academy 
of sciences 
the students began their protest because of alleged 
manipulations in junes parliamentary elections in which the 
socialists won a majority of seats 
the demonstrators are also demanding a public trial of ousted 
communist leader todor zhivkov under investigation for alleged 
abuse of power incitement to ethnic hatred and misappropriation of 
state property 
the demonstrators reiterated their other demands at an 
improvised openair news conference wednesday they want 
a new president who is not linked to the political and army 
establishment 
removal of parliamentary immunity from people implicated in the 
running of prison camps in the 1950s in the 1968 sovietled 
invasion of czechoslovakia and in the state persecution of ethnic 
turks in 198485 
and the whole truth revealed about the bulgarian foreign 
debt now totaling about 10 billion and about the property of the 
ruling party and its former leaders

miss america contestants will no 
longer pose for photographers in swimsuits but the swimsuit 
competition will remain a part of the preliminary and final 
contests the pageant director said wednesday 
i personally find it difficult to rationalize putting a young 
college woman in a swimsuit and high heel shoes said leonard 
horn who feels the photo sessions no longer fit in with a pageant 
he envisions as a scholarship contest 
he noted however that pageant traditionalists oppose removing 
that segment adding its such an integral and traditional part 
of the competition that i would be loathe to change it without an 
alternative 
in years past photo sessions with bathing suitclad contestants 
were held at sites around atlantic city 
judges tally the score according to a formula that gives 15 
percent each to the swimsuit and evening gown competitions 30 
percent for an interview with a preliminary panel of judges and 40 
percent for talent

couple of times each time in an amount worth about 50

the president of the american chamber 
of commerce in the philippines who criticized government economic 
policies has left the country after receiving warnings that his 
life was in danger sources said thursday 
mark blacker who is also first vice president of the american 
express bank and executive director of the international corporate 
bank left for hong kong last week sources in the business 
community said 
it was uncertain when he would return his departure comes amid 
increasing concern over security for about 140000 americans 
residing in the philippines 
officials of the chamber are not generally known outside the 
business community but blacker had been in the news recently after 
publicly criticizing president corazon aquinos government for 
failing to provide incentives to foreign investors 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said blacker 
was warned that communist rebels planned to kill him 
they said blacker had been planning to go abroad anyway for eye 
surgery but that the timing of his departure was influenced by 
concern over his security 
communist rebels are believed to have killed eight americans in 
the philippines since april 1989 all but two of them were us 
service members or affiliated with the military 
in a statement last year romulo kintanar commander of the new 
peoples army said us service members were the principal targets 
and that the rebels would not harm ordinary civilians who were not 
linked to the governments counterinsurgency program 
last month the us government withdrew all peace corps members 
and suspended the program because of fears that the rebels would 
try to kill or kidnap a volunteer 
after the order us officials learned that one volunteer 
timothy swanson of cheyenne wyo had been held by the rebels on 
negros island since june 13 
the newspaper businessworld said blacker received a warning from 
a us official one day after he told foreign correspondents that 
wouldbe investors were being driven from the philippines because 
of inadequate infrastructure and government indecision 
i dont see any solution at hand blacker said in a meeting 
with correspondents july 3 i dont know what they government 
agencies are doing i would like to see more unity of purpose 
between everybody in this country 
blackers comments were widely reported in the philippine media 
some commentators claimed the remarks were part of an orchestrated 
us government plot to pressure the government to extend the lease 
on the six american military bases which expires in september 1991

associates of escobar 
but the drug lord aided by about 15 bodyguards fled into the 
jungle near puerto triunfo about 75 miles east of bogota the 
police spokesman said

a committee formed in 1983 to advise the 
mayor on the homeless quit in protest wednesday saying mayor w 
wilson goode ignored it while making drastic cuts in services 
some 80 members of the mayors publicprivate task force on 
homelessness resigned in a unanimous voice vote at a meeting two 
days after its leadership recommended the action 
after the vote the citys managing director david pingree 
told the group that quitting en masse would leave the homeless 
without a voice in city hall 
they are advocates for the homeless pingree said afterward 
the task force provided them an internal mechanism in government 
that very few groups had the opportunity to have 
in order to preserve the purity of their advocacy they were 
throwing away a very pragmatic tool 
were not losing anything were gaining the ability to go 
back to being advocates said task force steering committee 
cochairwoman chris simiriglia 
it sent them a message said chris sprowal founder of the 
committee for dignity and fairness for the homeless and a member of 
the task forces steering committee it says the most 
conservative homeless group in the city will not sit still while 
you try to implement these terrible terrible cuts 
steering committee member phyllis ryan director of the 
philadelphia committee for the homeless a private organization 
estimated last years budget cut money for the homeless in half to 
17 million 
the current budget cuts leave only about 10 million for 
homeless services she said 
nobody can use us again to say there is a rational process 
going on here ryan said that was destroyed today 
the task force made up of officials from city agencies 
directors of private efforts such as shelters and soup kitchens as 
well as homeless people had no real power members said 
this has been a con job for years sprowal said they have 
made people feel important by saying youre a member of a task 
force and they get letters from the mayor saying come to a 
meeting 
and they feel important that they have some influence when 
in the end they found out they had no damn influence at all 
pingree managing director for four months said he regretted 
that the group quit he said nobody from the group had come to him 
during budget talks to argue their case 
a statement from the steering committee said our protests 
against the devastation of the cutbacks fell on deaf ears its now 
impossible to remain in this group whose forum has no influence

parliament on wednesday rejected calls for a 
probe of former defense minister yitzhak rabins handling of the 
palestinian uprising 
the move came hours after a new poll was released indicating 
rabin has become israels most popular politician 
the poll showed rabin the no 2 man in the leftleaning labor 
party could defeat prime minister yitzhak shamir and housing 
minister ariel sharon the leading figures in the rightwing likud 
bloc if direct elections were held 
however the poll indicated both shamir and sharon could defeat 
the labor party leader former prime minister shimon peres if the 
elections were held now the poll was expected to strengthen 
rabins hand in challenging peres for party leadership 
voters currently select slates of candidates but parliament has 
given preliminary approval to a bill for election reform for direct 
balloting 
the motion for a probe of rabins handling of the palestinian 
uprising was defeated by a vote of 65 to 16 both right and 
leftwing legislators had accused rabin of illegally ordering 
soldiers to beat rioters in january 1988 
the orders led to a number of deaths and serious injuries of 
palestinians rabin was defense minister until march 13 when he 
resigned with other labor ministers to protest shamirs hesitancy 
to accept american peace proposals shamir last month formed a 
rightwing government that excluded labor 
in all 723 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers 
and civilians since the uprising began in december 1987 an 
additional 233 palestinians have been slain by fellow arabs most 
for alleged collaboration with israeli authorities fortyfive 
israelis also have been killed by arabs 
one sponsor of the call for a probe accused rabin of failing to 
support army officers charged with illegally beating palestinians 
to death he claimed troop morale was also at stake 
you personally gave these orders why shouldnt you stand 
trial said michael eitan of shamirs likud bloc soldiers from 
now on will fear that all the orders they get will later be 
disavowed 
another sponsor yossi sarid of the leftwing citizens rights 
movement said if the government found it necessary to establish 
an investigation into sabra and chatilla it should certainly do so 
now 
he was refefering to the 1982 massacre in beirut refugee camps 
by lebanese militiamen during israels occupation an official 
inquiry into the massacre of hundreds of palestinian refugees ended 
in the resigation of sharon as defense minister 
rabin defended his policies by saying that beatings were ordered 
to limit the use of live ammunition which were causing many 
fatalities at the time 
he insisted his instructions were clear that once a 
demonstration was under control beating should cease 
rabin said he told senior officers on jan 21 1988 that the 
aggressive response by our soldiers including beatings during 
riots and against attacks on our forces are necessary to prevent 
the worst opening fire and causing death 
and i also said in the same discussion this which means 
beatings is better than what went before which means opening fire 
with live ammunition on condition it is done during demonstrations 
and attacks and not afterwards 
the israeliborn rabin 68 also a former prime minister gained 
popularity in israel for his tough stance against the palestinian 
uprising 
the poll indicating his most recent popularity was conducted 
between june 24 and july 3 among 1200 jewish adults by independent 
pollster hanoch smith it had three percent margin of error it was 
published in the jerusalem post daily 
it showed that in a direct election rabin would gather 50 
percent of the vote to shamirs 33 percent the remainder were 
undecided 
against sharon 54 percent would choose rabin 28 percent sharon 
shamir however would outpoll labor leader peres 44 percent to 
29 percent and sharon would beat him 37 percent to 34 percent 
new elections are not scheduled until 1992

the rev jesse jackson on wednesday called on 
president bush to hold a domestic summit to discuss social and 
economic justice in the united states 
jackson made his call at the 81st annual convention of the 
national association for the advancement of colored people while 
bush wrapped up an economic summit with world leaders in houston 
if indeed mr bush can have a summit meeting with world 
leaders he can have a domestic summit with civil rights 
leaders jackson said 
we need and deserve a summit to discuss urban development and 
a rural renaissance he told several thousand naacp delegates 
we need a call for perestroika for restructuring our economy 
for openness 
the federal government should offer developers of small 
businesses and lowincome housing the same kinds of longterm 
lowinterest loans it gives other nations and set aside the same 
kind of money it is spending to bail out failed savings and loans 
said jackson 
money must be found to bail out urban and rural america he 
said 
jackson said the difference between bushs foreign and domestic 
policies and those of former president ronald reagan was 
onionskin thin 
there has been a false perception that there has been a 
fundamental change in the white house he said both used 
quotas as scare tactics bush cut the housing budget reagan cut 
the housing budget neither supports the equal rights amendment for 
women 
jackson also reiterated his support for statehood for 
washington dc and his plans to run for shadow senator of 
the district in november 
we pay more taxes per capita than 49 states jackson said 
every other national capital in the western world has 
representation but us weve been robbed of representation 
jackson who has made two unsuccessful bids for the presidency 
would not say if he would try again ive not made that decision 
yet he said 
earlier naacp delegates ratified numerous resolutions 
including one that supports dropping the employer sanctions in the 
immigration reform and control act of 1986 under which employers 
can be fined if they knowingly hire illegal immigrants 
those who proposed the resolution said dropping the sanctions 
provision would decrease discrimination against immigrants others 
voiced concern that immigrants take jobs from lowincome black 
teenagers 
naacp executive director benjamin hooks said delegates should 
worry about creating jobs for all people who want and need them 
not whether one group is taking jobs from another 
the real problem in america is creating more jobs hooks 
said

president bush defended his son neils integrity 
anew on wednesday and said he has had to calm down other bush sons 
who wanted to go to the barricades over public criticism of 
neils role in a savings and loan controversy 
bush renewed his promise not to intervene in an investigation by 
federal bank regulators of his 34yearold sons role as a director 
of a denver sampl that went bankrupt at a cost to taxpayers of 1 
billion 
this is not easy for me as a father its easy for me as a 
president because the systems going to work said bush at a news 
conference shortly after wrapping up the economic summit 
in washington federal officials said they were considering a 
negligence lawsuit against neil bush and other former directors of 
silverado banking savings and loan association 
bush was asked if he thought regulators were conducting a 
vendetta against his son because of the relationship with the 
president 
i agree that the president ought to stay out of it and that 
the system ought to work he said i have great confidence in 
the integrity and honor of my son 
and if hes done something wrong the system will digest 
that said bush 
commenting on his family more generally he said its tough 
on people in public life to some degree 
ive got three other sons and they all want to go to the 
barricades every one of them when they see some cartoon they 
dont like particularly those that are factually incorrect and 
total demeaning of the honor of their brother they want to do what 
any other kids would do the president said 
he said he has advised them you calm down now were in a 
different role now you cant react like you would if your brother 
was picked on in a street fight thats not the way the system 
works 
as he spoke his wife barbara sat listening in the front row 
we have great emotions that i share with barbara and i share 
with my sons and my daughter that i wont share with you bush 
said 
later as the bushes returned to washington aboard air force 
one mrs bush was asked her reaction 
the president spoke for all the family today she told 
reporters i loved what he said you dont want to see a grown 
woman cry do you the president spoke for us all 
neil bush has denied any wrongdoing in the sampl case and has 
called the investigation politically motivated 
silverado loaned more than 45 million to a bush business 
partner bill l walters who never repaid the money according to 
regulators

a new book has revived the 125yearold dispute 
about whether four members of the first party to climb the 
matterhorn died by accident or design 
rumors and suspicions have lingered since the rope connecting 
them to the three other climbers broke on the matterhorns north 
face less than two hours after the team conquered the 14700foot 
peak on july 14 1865 
they fell 4000 feet to their deaths 
the victims were french guide michel croz and three englishmen 
the rev charles hudson 36 douglas hadow 19 and lord francis 
douglas 20 whose body was never found the survivors were british 
writerartist edward whymper who initiated the expedition a local 
guide peter taugwalder and the guides son 
an investigation found no evidence of foul play but police kept 
the result secret and it became known only 55 years later through 
an article published in britains alpine journal 
early rumors first mentioned in a vienna newspaper alleged 
that whymper cut the rope to enhance his own fame he said in a 
letter to the times of london in august 1865 that none of the three 
survivors could be blamed for the deaths but did not refer to the 
rumors 
six years later a graphic account of the climb in whympers 
scrambles amongst the alps added fuel to the controversy it 
said suggestions that the swiss guide taugwalder cut the rope 
were infamous whymper said such rumors persisted in the 
guides native zermatt at the foot of the matterhorn 
whympers book also referred however to grave suspicion 
falling on the swiss guide because the rope between taugwalder and 
the nearest of the four others lord douglas was the thinnest 
and the weakest one we had 
this was suspicious because it is unlikely that the four men 
in front would have selected an old and weak rope when there was 
abundance of new and much stronger rope to spare whymper wrote 
if taugwalder thought that an accident was likely to happen 
it was to his interest to have the weaker rope where it was 
placed he said implying this would protect taugwalder from 
being dragged along 
more than a century later that comment by whymper caused swiss 
writer hannes taugwalder a distant relation of the guide to begin 
two decades of research the result closer to the truth was 
published just before the 125th anniversary 
taugwalder portrays whymper as an icecold fiercely 
ambitious man whose education and intelligence easily allowed him 
to dominate the two swiss survivors 
of course there were others in zermatt who envied peter 
taugwalder but the rumors about him started only after whympers 
book came out the writer said in a telephone interview with the 
associated press 
his book contends the guide had to use the weak rope because 
whymper cut the better one shortly before reaching the summit so he 
could race up the last few yards 
whympers account does not mention any cutting but says he and 
the french guide croz dashing away ran a neckandneck race 
which ended in a dead heat 
citing the works of sir arnold lunn the late british author of 
mountaineering and skiing books taugwalder wrote that whymper once 
told a dinner companion he vaguely remembered cutting the rope to 
free him for the race with croz 
there were two strong manila hemp ropes each 30 meters 
long the book says one linked the first four descending the 
other being cut was not long enough to tie it to the last of the 
four 
and whymper insinuated that taugwalder who had actually no 
alternative chose the weak rope because it would have saved his 
life in case of an accident he said this was malevolent 
slander 
hannes taugwalder who has scaled the matterhorn twice concedes 
the full story may never be known thats why i titled the book 
closer to the truth he said

a leader of dissenters richard price 
sees no end to the turmoil afflicting the reorganized church of 
jesus christ of latter day saints unless its assertedly 
liberal leadership resigns or does a doctrinal aboutface 
we dont know exactly how we will get the church back but we 
intend to do it says price one of thousands of former or 
dissenting members called fundamentalists who want the church to 
return to its 19th century roots 
just as firmly the faiths president says that while discontent 
among a small minority is regrettable their departure from the 
main body has unified those who remain 
i hate to say that it helps us because it certainly does 
not said wallace b smith rlds president at the same time i 
would have to say that to the extent there is less contention less 
daytoday bickering it could be advantageous 
many of the issues dividing about 150 dissenting congregations 
called restoration branches from the americanborn churchs 
mainstream of about 1100 congregations have brewed for decades 
but discontent rose sharply after smith in 1984 announced a 
revelation encouraging priesthood ordination for women 
that was just the last strw because it was a very tangible 
issue said william russell a professor at churchoperated 
graceland college in limoni iowa who is writing a book about the 
split 
the 243000member rlds shares a common 1830 origin with the 4 
millionmember church of jesus christ of latterday saints 
mormons its members followed leader brigham young to utah after 
the death in illinois of church founder joseph smith jr in 1844 
the rlds church was organized in 1860 by followers of smith in 
the midwest with his son joseph smith iii as its prophet its 
canon of scripture includes the bible the book of mormon and the 
doctrine and covenants but its theology differs substantially from 
the larger body 
sharp differences over the future of the rlds church and 
interpretation of its past including the historicity of the book 
of mormon and its authors visionary claims have fractured many 
rlds congregations and families 
fundamentalists say the hierarchy has deemphasized the book of 
mormon and ignored joseph smiths divine mandate to restore the 
true gospel to a christian world fallen into apostasy since new 
testament times 
moderates counter that the church must change to meet new 
conditions 
the conservatives seem to me just to kind of want to freeze 
the church at a point they feel represents kind of an ideal 
doctrinal position wallace b smith said however he said the 
church holds that through divine inspiration gospel principles 
can be subject to further interpretation in order to meet the needs 
of a changing society 
since 1984 the conservative movement has grown to about 20000 
a majority in the independencekansas city area according to a 
price survey russell believes the figure is accurate and that 
fundamentalists make up about 15 percent of regularly attending 
rlds membership 
through his independence publishing company price has printed 
dozens of books pamphlets and a 7000circulation magazine aimed 
at showing point by point that the church is being led toward 
mainstream protestantism by leaders who ignore or distort the 
faiths founding beliefs 
it took 30 years for the hierarchy to inject this humanistic 
theology in the church and were prepared to wait even longer if 
necessary to take it back said price who was expelled from the 
church in 1987 in part for his practice of running fullpage 
newspaper ads challenging rlds leaders 
smith and other church leaders dispute the size of the 
insurrection but have acted decisively to quell it seizing chapels 
of dissident congregations and officially silencing rebellious 
elements of the lay ministry in 198889 alone 1242 men were 
silenced or released from the priesthood 
we have particularly expected our priesthood members to be 
supportive of our actions and not use the pulpit to oppose them 
said smith 60 rlds president since 1978 
most observers of the conflict say it originated with the advent 
in 1958 of president w wallace smith the current presidents late 
father and his associates who led a reevaluation of mission as 
the church expanded abroad 
there was much less emphasis on joseph smith and the book of 
mormon more on the bible and general christian thinking russell 
said 
smith said the church will continue to emphasize evangelism and 
spend ourselves in the pursuit of peace and justice 
he said the church views the book of mormon as scripture which 
speaks truth about god but that determining its exact 
historicity simply will have to await that time when there are 
some archaeological proofs or evidences 
the book which joseph smith claimed to have translated from 
gold plates given him by an angel purports to be a history of 
peoples from the middle east who came to the americas and were 
visited by a resurrected christ

seeking an objective opinion of where financial 
markets are headed fidelity investments one of the worlds 
biggest buyers and sellers of securities has gone to the source 
its asking investors 
while that step might not seem revolutionary it is decidedly 
the opposite of how the marketplace usually functions more often 
than not most popularly circulated opinions originate with brokers 
rather than investors 
wall streeters are prolific advisers dispensing a flood of 
opinions every minute hour and day about almost any subject known 
or unknown to them the primary purpose of which is to keep the 
market active and remunerative 
whether it accomplishes the latter is a moot point since the 
proliferation of opinion comes at a great cost in credibility 
in contrast there is probably no opinion more solid than that 
of buyers or potential buyers whose views are based on their own 
financial condition expectations and ability to buy or sell 
it is into this mine of data that fidelity is delving to create 
its survey of individual investors a statistical measurement of 
investor sentiments and expectations including intentions three 
months into the future 
good news or poor fidelity will have to live with results of 
the survey because it is being conducted and controlled by the 
university of michigans survey research center already noted for 
surveys of consumer sentiment 
sindlinger amp co a wallingford pa marketing and research 
firm already produces similar surveys for clients but this is the 
first time a worldwide marketer of securities which fidelity is 
has entered the field 
the rationale for doing so is that sound surveys of consumer 
sentiment and expectations already have demonstrated that a 
relationship exists between consumer expectations and actual 
changes that later occur in the economy 
that relationship has been demonstrated for example in the 
areas of interest rates unemployment levels inflation rates 
gross national product homebuying and vehicle purchases why not 
securities too 
fidelitys questions were added to the michigan survey in 
january so as yet there is little historical record with which to 
make comparisons but in those few months of existence some 
significant findings have emerged 
michael hines fidelity vice president for marketing points 
out for example that junes investor expectations were 
encouraging since investor households measured significantly 
higher than households in general 
another important finding was that after four straight months of 
expecting interest rates to rise investors in june said they 
anticipated a decline over the next 12 months 
the survey also found 
established investors continue to view prospects for their own 
financial situation in favorable terms 
among various types of mutual funds owners of money market 
funds are most likely to plan additional investments in the next 
three months 
owners of individual stocks in may seemed to be more content 
with their position than in april fewer were likely to make 
additional investments and fewer were likely to sell 
these are among the first findings released by fidelity 
hereafter said hines detailed results will be issued on a regular 
monthly basis within a week of each surveys completion

as they map out strategies for managing their 
personal finances in the 1990s many americans seem to have agreed 
on a common precept put a little less faith in credit 
they havent sworn off borrowing by any means as of may they 
carried no less than 725 billion in credit card balances auto 
loans and other types of consumer debt 
but the growth of borrowing and lending activity which 
sometimes proceeded at a dizzying pace in the 1980s has shown 
distinct signs of slowing 
while that threatens to worsen the various woes of the economy 
in the near future many economists say it could well prove over 
the longer term to be a sensible and beneficial development for all 
concerned 
the cutback on credit often is seen as the result of and a 
necessary response to the borrowing spree of the past decade 
most analysts agree that is a primary force behind the trend 
but see several other important influences as well 
a fundamental shift in attitude towards leverage has occurred 
in the us economy and is being reinforced by government policy 
says richard hoey chief economist in the united states for the 
international investment firm of barclays de zoete wedd inc 
there is both a reduced willingness to demand credit and a 
reduced willingness to supply credit 
the government has played a part on both sides of the equation 
pressure from bank regulators has helped push many lending 
institutions toward extracautious standards in deciding who 
qualifies for a loan 
at the same time tax changes put into effect over the past 
several years seem to be crimping consumers demand for loans 
just a decade ago uncle sam permitted tax deductions that 
subsidized borrowing to the tune of as much as 50 cents for each 1 
in interest that consumers paid now that deduction is worth 33 
cents per dollar of interest at most and it disappears altogether 
next jan 1 
if tax changes make borrowing these days seem more expensive so 
does the relatively high level of interest rates in comparison to 
the inflation rate 
while inflation runs at an annual pace of 4 percent to 5 
percent a car buyer might pay an average of 1229 percent on a 
fouryear 9000 auto loan according to the bank rate monitor 
personal loans and credit card borrowing typically run in the 17 
percent to 19 percent range or higher in some cases 
gone is the incentive that existed in the late 1970s and early 
1980s to borrow freely paying interest costs of nearly nothing 
once inflation was taken into account 
furthermore with the flattening out of the boom in the housing 
market the use of debt as speculative leverage in real estate has 
lost a lot of its appeal 
observers like hoey also say an absence of heady gains in home 
prices has dampened enthusiasm for types of credit other than 
mortgages and construction loans 
we believe that real estate values and the perception of real 
estate liquidity are crucial to consumer confidence he says 
even in the absence of a major change in real estate prices the 
perceived or psychic liquidity of real estate fluctuates 
middleclass balance sheets become less liquid when real 
estate turnover drops putting downward pressure on the willingness 
to spend among consumers

television broadcasters pat robertson and jerry falwell both 
retreated from national politics and began tending to their own 
spiritual gardens after sowing the seeds that brought forth the 
political movement of the religious right 
but their paths now seem to be diverging 
both of their tv ministries have rebounded from drops in 
viewership and donations in the 1980s and the christian 
universities they founded in virginia are expanding with record 
enrollments 
falwells moral majority political action organization which 
grew to 65 million members disbanded in 1989 robertsons freedom 
council also faded away after his unsuccessful bid for president in 
1988 
now robertson the pentecostal son of a us senator and 
distant relative of two presidents is trying to remobilize his 
political troops falwell the fundamentalist grandson of a 
bootlegger and son of a successful businessman is resolved to stay 
out of politics 
jeffrey hadden a university of virginia sociologist and expert 
on the christian right said there is more than a difference in 
religion to explain the diverging paths 
robertson has politics in his blood hadden said after his 
exposure in the 1988 presidential campaign its hard for him to 
walk away and say im not interested hadden said jerry did 
it but jerry is less of a political animal 
falwell is spending most of his time in lynchburg running 
liberty university and said he believes the way to change a culture 
is by educating the youth 
i felt i did what i had to do that is organize the religious 
right falwell 56 said during an interview on campus i never 
had any intentions of staying out there in the political arena 
robertson meantime is once again trying to enlist the aid of 
conservative christians who backed his failed republican 
presidential bid in 1988 
the christian coalition was formed by robertson this summer to 
help christian candidates get elected to local and state offices 
and congress director ralph reed jr said 
in addition the coalition ran a fullpage advertisement in the 
washington post on june 20 signed by robertson that warned 
members of congress against financing the national endowment for 
the arts without restrictions on what he considers pornographic art 
robertson said he has no plans to make personal use of the 
organization which hopes to more than triple its membership of 
30000 before years end 
during an interview at his sprawling christian broadcasting 
network in virginia beach robertson laughed when asked what it 
would take to get him to run for elected office 
i think an angel coming down and standing in front of me and 
then three or four other signs it would not be something i would 
do lightly its too big an ordeal and the price is too great he 
said 
for a politician to run for president all they do is go back 
to being senator or governor or what have you for me the cost was 
over 150 million and thats just too great a price to pay he 
said 
hadden said he believes robertson will find it too hard to 
resist entering the 1996 presidential race if there is no heir 
apparent to george bush and said the christian coalition may be 
greasing the skids 
roberstons organization is an attempt to fill the gap in 
leadership among conservative christians hadden said 
conceivably it could work but well have to wait and see 
robertson wrote in a christian coalition newsletter mailed to 
250000 homes that we want the activists mobilized in 1988 to 
stay involved in the political process not for a single campaign 
but for the long haul 
robertson said in an interview that his primary campaign for the 
republican presidential nomination was a valuable learning 
experience 
im beginning to see enormous benefits from the campaign that 
i didnt see at the end of 1988 he said 
those benefits include what robertson calls thousands of 
political activists who supported his campaign those activists 
gained experience and are now taking local and state leadership 
positions within the party he said 
besides a cadre of battleseasoned political activists 
robertson said he has a list of 18 million families who expressed 
an interest in his politics plus theres a very substantial list 
of contributors to the campaign those together make a very nice 
base for another organization 
christian conservatives make up about 20 percent of the 
electorate said a james reichley an expert on the impact of 
religion in history and a senior fellow at the brookings 
institution in washington 
falwell and robertson played a significant role in persuading 
them to become involved in politics reichley said they have 
both drawn back somewhat as religious groups in general have in 
the last couple of years 
robertsons loss in 1988 he said gave the whole movement 
somewhat of a setback

five times in little more than a year dallas 
county has freed prisoners who were unjustly convicted earning it 
a reputation as a modernday practitioner of the old west necktie 
party 
does dallas hang first and ask questions later 
randall dale adams martin kimsey joyce ann brown michael 
anthony woten and stephen lynn russell would agree they spent a 
total of 44 years in prison before courts or the governor decided 
they never should have been sent there 
but prosecutors say the county is getting a bum rap and many 
defense lawyers say dallas differs from other justice systems only 
in the celebrity of its wrongfully convicted prisoners 
foremost among them is adams 41 released last year after more 
than 12 years in prison adams conviction in the shooting of a 
dallas police officer was overturned after a key witness recanted 
his testimony and the courts found a prosecutor had withheld 
evidence 
his story was recounted in the film the thin blue line and 
adams who once was just days away from execution now tours the 
lecture circuit 
his attorney randy schaffer of houston says an adams case 
could happen anywhere i suspect it is something that extends 
across the country he said i dont think its limited to 
dallas county 
but it has happened with unnerving regularity in dallas 
kimsey 49 was freed feb 9 after spending five years in 
prison on a 1985 armoredcar robbery conviction a federal prisoner 
since has confessed to the crime kimsey rearrested after being 
found with marijuana and alcohol was pardoned by the governor may 
21 and released two days later 
brown 42 who spent nine years in prison for the armed 
robbery of a dallas fur store learned in february she would not be 
retried an appeals court overturned her 1980 conviction ruling 
prosecutors should have told the defense a key witness had been 
convicted of lying to police 
woten 36 was pardoned in february after serving almost eight 
years for an april 1982 grocerystore robbery another man has 
admitted the crime 
russell 37 was pardoned in april after serving 10 years 
another man confessed to the 1980 holdup of a garland fastfood 
restaurant 
another case of dallas justice gone wrong was that of lenell 
geter an aerospace engineer who served 16 months in prison for the 
1982 armed robbery of a kentucky fried chicken restaurant the case 
drew national attention when it was examined on 60 minutes 
if you go into any other state youll find the same thing 
is going on there said tom krampitz executive director of the 
texas district and county attorneys association in austin 
others among them john boston executive director of the 
texas criminal defense lawyers association in austin and ronald 
huff director of the criminal justice research center at ohio 
state university say dallas county seems to convict an unusual 
number of innocent people 
certainly in terms of known cases dallas county has had 
more than one would expect said huff author of the upcoming 
book convicted but innocent wrongful conviction and public 
policy 
neither side has data to back up its perceptions legal experts 
say no one tracks wrongful conviction rates except in death 
penalty cases but even those who defend dallas justice say it has 
characteristics not common elsewhere 
huff advocates reinvestigating many cases that date to the days 
of henry wade the cigarchomping prosecutor who ruled the dallas 
county district attorneys office for 36 years before retiring in 
1987 
wade pegged his employees promotions to the number of people 
they put behind bars and the length of their sentences 
dallas still has a national reputation for promoting prosecutors 
on the basis of their conviction rate said scott wallace 
legislative director of the national association of criminal 
defense lawyers in alexandria va 
its a system that tends to promote the numbers of convictions 
over fairness and due process to my knowledge that is quite 
unusual he said 
the emphasis has changed since john vance succeeded wade in the 
district attorneys office said vances first assistant norm 
kinne 
conviction rates he said are not as important a factor in 
our determination if someone is ready to be promoted its just 
something that is taken with all the rest of his or her 
statistics 
the critics cite other reasons for wrongful convictions high on 
the list is trial by ambush as defense attorneys have tagged 
prosecutors practice of springing new evidence at a trial 
i think the mentality at the forefront in dallas is lets 
hide everything we can lets play it like a game said 
schaffer who got adams conviction overturned partly because of 
withheld evidence 
kinne maintains the argument should be the other way around 
unlike many states where both sides of a legal case are required 
to disclose evidence to the other texas criminal law is onesided 
prosecutors are required to share certain information with the 
defense but defense attorneys are under no obligation to 
reciprocate 
i find it strange that they can say trial by ambush when 
they give us nothing in the way of discovery and we give them a 
whole lot how is that an ambush whos ambushing who kinne 
asked 
critics also cite a lack of funds for public defenders texas 
system of public defense offices representing the indigent is less 
developed than most other states said mardi crawford a staff 
attorney with the national legal aid and defender association in 
washington 
in 1986 texas ranked 39th in publicdefense spending ms 
crawford said citing a bureau of justice report of the latest 
figures available 
texas spends an average of 154 per inmate on public defense 
she said new jersey spent the most 540 per inmate and 
arkansas the least 63 
krampitz of the district and county attorneys association said 
all law enforcement authorities need better training and higher 
pay and that applies to prosecutors and judges along with defense 
attorneys he said you pay peanuts you get monkeys 
even those who fault dallas justice system say no one should 
place blame solely on prosecutors 
theres a whole lot of other folks that have been involved in 
this process krampitz said each wrongful conviction was decided 
by a jury and each convict had a lawyer 
anybody that says the system is perfect is nuts said 
schaffer 
juries bring to the courtroom whatever biases they hold 
outside the courtroom he said not every defendant is guilty 
not every police officer tells the truth not every eyewitness is 
perfect the problem is in individual cases everybody forgets all 
that

while prime minister petre roman 
pledges to move toward a free economy bucharest police are 
cracking down on the bustling black market 
in a few days last month they arrested 1680 black market 
operators and confiscated goods worth 270000 a police statement 
reported it also said the illegal trade would be eradicated 
but success has been elusive 
the black market is the only source for many items the goods 
often are stolen from factories or stores sometimes with the aid 
of bribed workers 
fighting the trade and the corruption it feeds is made more 
difficult by tolerance of the underground market by a public long 
accustomed to facing shortages in stores and seeking ways around 
them 
after more than four decades of a planned economy and shortages 
of virtually everything romanians are uncertain of how to approach 
a free market 
officials speak proudly of more liberal rules on private 
initiative promulgated since communist dictator nicolae ceausescu 
was deposed and executed in december but say theft and 
profiteering have accompanied freedom 
vasile sebe president of the free trade union in commerce was 
quoted by the daily romania libera as saying free initiative 
must not turn into speculation with products which are scarce 
but should stimulate entrepreneurs to find new sources of 
supplies 
production businesses have been slow to emerge because private 
enterprises are limited to 20 employees and the bureaucracy remains 
cumbersome thievery and the black market have flourished 
police reported the theft of coffee worth 50000 in june and 
said only onefifth of it was recovered 
state television said eight men were arrested in the act of 
stealing boots from the dimbovita footwear factory in bucharest for 
sale on the black market 
the ease of travel in and out of this once tightly guarded 
country has added an international dimension to the illicit trade 
in brasov 125 miles north of bucharest three workers at a 
manufacturing plant stole spare parts worth more than 7500 and 
sold them to a yugoslav for a combination of romanian currency 
german marks and foreign goods 
at a factory in botosani in northeastern romania the sales 
manager ordered 872 mens shirts worth 4600 from the warehouse 
sold them to people planning trips to poland and kept the money 
officials reported 
authorities hope a customs law that took effect this month will 
help impede the black market by limiting the amount of goods 
visitors can take in or out of the country without submitting to 
the foreign trade law 
despite the crackdown everything from bubble gum to mercedes 
cars continues to be sold in bucharests illegal street markets 
during the june raids police arrested several gypsies who were 
selling cold beer in the street for more than five times the 
official price 
a bottle of wine may be worth 1 officially in a country where 
average monthly pay equals about 125 but the state shops dont 
have any because profiteers pay 175 a bottle under the counter 
and sell it for 250 
grigore untulescu who sells soft drinks at quadruple the 
official price said someone else would do it if he didnt and 
besides they cant arrest us all

a securities analyst fired after panning 
donald trumps new casino is seeking 2 million in damages for 
alleged defamatory comments by the developer that he was a bad 
analyst and unguided missile 
marvin b roffman formerly a vice president with the 
philadelphia brokerage firm janney montgomery scott inc sued the 
new york real estate and casino operator in us district court on 
tuesday 
roffman 50 was fired march 23 three days after a negative 
critique in the wall street journal about trumps new taj mahal 
casino resort in atlantic city nj 
the case has attracted wide attention not only because it 
involves trump but because it has raised questions about the 
independence of securities analysts who comment frequently about 
companies and business trends 
roffman told the journal trumps casino would flourish 
immediately after it opened in april but once the cold winds 
blow from october to february it wont make it the market just 
isnt there 
john barry a trump spokesman said he expects the lawsuit to be 
dismissed we will take the appropriate action to have the suit 
dismissed as quickly as possible he said 
in a letter to janney montgomery president norman t wilde after 
roffmans comments were published trump said for a long while i 
have thought of mr roffman as an unguided missile according to 
the suit 
the lawsuit contends trumps letter contained false and 
defamatory material because roffmans comments were not 
outrageous he is not an unguided missile unprofessional and a 
bad analyst 
roffmans attorney martin sobol said his client believes he 
lost his job because he was honest roffman who is currently 
unemployed declined to comment 
the lawsuit quotes publications that reported trumps comments 
about roffman as evidence of defamation 
in the april 2 edition of barrons trump said of roffman 
hes a very unprofessional guy a hair trigger in the may 7 
edition of fortune trump is quoted as saying they got rid of a 
bad analyst a man with little talent the lawsuit said 
barry said trump was free to express himself if mr roffman 
thought the statements were defamatory why isnt he suing the 
publications in which they appear barry said 
the lawsuit also claims trump maliciously persuaded janney 
montgomery to fire roffman 
mr trump has no financial interest or control over janney 
montgomery to blame mr trump for janney montgomerys action is 
incomprehensible barry said 
trump threatened to sue janney montgomery unless roffman 
publicly retracted the comments or the firm fired the 16year 
veteran analyst roffman initially signed a letter of apology but 
withdrew it in a second letter and then was fired 
janney montgomery contended roffman was dismissed because he 
violated company policy by issuing statements to the press that had 
not been cleared or disseminated to the firms clients 
wilde said in a statement that roffman also disobeyed a 
supervisors orders by sending the second letter to trump 
retracting his apology 
in dismissing mr roffman we took measures to uphold industry 
standards concerning the professional integrity of security 
analysts the statement said 
janney montgomery is a wholly owned subsidiary of penn mutual 
life insurance co the firm has 1050 employees and 40 offices 
roffmans comments about trump made him a highly sought subject 
for interviews especially after recent disclosures that trump 
faced a cash crunch 
trump made a lastminute deal with bankers june 26 that allowed 
him to meet the 43 million payment to holders of highyield junk 
bonds backing another casino the trump castle

from the trading floors to the executive suites 
futures industry professionals breathed a little easier after the 
government failed to prove a fraud racket operated at chicago 
mercantile exchange 
the reaction here is a deep sigh of relief said john 
damgard president of the washingtonbased futures industry 
association a trade group for commodity futures brokerage firms 
the verdicts shore up the contention that this was petty theft 
compared with everything thats gone on in the savings and loan and 
securities industries and we can feel pretty good about 
ourselves damgard said 
business was brisk tuesday in the mercs swiss franc futures pit 
one day after a federal jury convicted two franc traders of 
relatively minor trading violations and acquitted a third 
the jury could not reach verdicts on scores of more serious 
charges including a racketeering count against one defendant and 
mail and wire fraud charges against all three 
federal prosecutors have said they plan to refile the remaining 
charges against the men whose sentencings are tentatively 
scheduled for november 
two more commodity fraud trials resulting from an fbi sting 
operation at the merc and the chicago board of trade are scheduled 
for september 
mondays conclusion of two months of us district court 
proceedings felt like kissing your sister said anton valukas 
the former us attorney now in private practice who initiated 
the 1988 undercover probe and announced the indictments last august 
but valukas said he was not disappointed in the verdicts 
in terms of the overall investigation and prosecution my 
sense is that you await the outcome of all of the cases and then 
you can sit back and talk about whether it was appropriate or not 
appropriate he said 
several defense lawyers preparing for the september trials said 
they were heartened by the verdicts 
it puts into serious question the governments basic claim 
that what happened here is that customers were defrauded on a 
wholesale basis said james streicker attorney for indicted yen 
futures trader michael smith 
defense lawyers said the governments failure to win a 
conviction on the racketeering count would dissuade other traders 
charged with racketeering from pleading guilty to reduced charges 
leo melamed chairman of the mercs executive committee noted 
that the guilty verdicts on eight counts seven against floor 
broker robert d mosky and one against independent trader danny 
scheck represented a total of 200 in funds lost to their 
customers through trading irregularities 
melamed said the merc did not condone any wrongdoing but added 
it has to be put in perspective 
we clearly dont believe this is as major a federal crime as 
some of these other things that are going on he said citing 
scandals in the sampl industry and the department of housing and 
urban development 
sol kaufman an independent trader of currency futures at the 
merc said news of the investigation and indictments had tarnished 
the mercs image 
i think to a certain degree this verdict will redeem that 
reputation he said 
the jury found independent trader david zatz innocent of two 
counts of trading violations the jury also acquitted mosky of 20 
counts of mail and wire fraud and couldnt reach a verdict on the 
racketeering count against him 
the panel returned verdicts on just 30 of the 116 counts in the 
federal indictment 
each commodity fraud count conviction carries a maximum prison 
sentence of five years and a 100000 fine prosecutors said 
the twomonth trial was the first to result from a sweeping 
undercover fbi investigation of corruption at the merc and the 
larger chicago board of trade the worlds two biggest futures 
exchanges 
in all 48 people have been indicted since august sixteen have 
pleaded guilty to reduced charges including two swiss franc 
traders who testified against mosky scheck and zatz 
two other groups 13 soybean traders from the board of trade 
and 15 japanese yen traders from the merc go on trial in 
september

with the smack of a sake bottle japanese 
shipbuilders on wednesday christened the worlds first ship that 
will use superconductivity to push itself through the water 
the hightech ship christened the yamato no 1 is an 
experimental vessel shaped roughly like a streamlined telephone it 
is drydocked in the kobe shipyard of mitsubishi heavy industries 
japans largest shipbuilder and a member of a consortium developing 
the ships new technology 
the ships developers said they view the vessel as a prototype 
for highgspped seacraft it will use electromagnetic force instead 
of a conventional screw propeller to thrust itself through the 
water 
the main purpose of the project however was to demonstrate 
that superconductivity could be used to power a ship they said 
this ship has been developed without regard to cost its 
experimental said jutaro namba a coordinator at mitsubishi 
heavy industries in kobe a major port in western japan about 270 
miles west of tokyo 
the 185ton ship is 33 yards long and about 11 yards wide 
superconducting coils made of niobium and titanium in thrusters 
underneath the ship are used to create a magnetic field that is 
repulsed by an electric current carried in water circulating 
through the thrusters the repulsion produces the same kind of 
force used to propel superconducting trains on land 
engineers who worked on the ship said a combination of helium 
gas and liquid nitrogen is used to cool the coils to minus 45247 
degrgees fahrenheit at that temperature electricity passes 
through the coils without resistance 
the use of waterpropelled thrusters instead of conventional 
rotating screw propellers is expected to minimize maintenance 
problems as well as noise and vibration 
the vessel also is energyefficient most of the space on board 
the ship is occupied however by dieselengine generators used to 
provide an electric current for the thrusters for pumps and for 
onboard equipment the engineers said 
the ships main handicap at present is its speed a mere 8 
knots compared with about 40 knots for fast hydroplanes and to 
minimize its weight it has space for only about 10 people 
experts say new materials are needed to produce a strong enough 
magnetic field to propel the ship at commercially viable speeds 
officials said that sea trials would be held in the spring of 
1991 after the ship is fitted with thrusters and other seagoing 
equipment a smaller model of the ship first was successfully 
tested in 1987 
the vessel is the brainchild of a consortium of companies 
universities and government researchers led by the japan foundation 
for shipbuilding advancement with funding from the ministry of 
transport 
superconductivity is expected to make the use of electricity 
much more efficient reducing the need for fossil fuels it is 
being developed for use in computers and their components in 
magnetically levitated highspeed trains electric cars and other 
devices

the states highest court has upheld investors 
ability to take some stockbroker disputes to independent 
arbitration dealing a blow to brokerage firms that have sought to 
limit them to industryrun panels 
the 60 ruling tuesday by the new york state court of appeals in 
albany could affect thousands of investors nationwide who must sign 
contracts with stockbrokers out how they must resolve disputes 
its really a victory for the consumer said theodore 
eppenstein who represented investor jeffrey anderson in a case 
against the brokerage cowen amp co it gets us up to the level 
playing field were looking for 
anderson in december 1988 sought to use a loophole in his 
arbitration contract to have a dispute settled by the american 
arbitration association rather than one of three industryrun 
panels anderson claims he lost 250000 through mishandling of his 
accounts 
opponents claim the securities industrys abitration system is 
stacked against the investor because the majority of arbitrators 
have some industry affiliation the industry denies any unfairness 
many investors have sought to bypass restrictions in contracts 
via a clause in the american stock exchanges constitution that 
permits customers to use the aaa unless the contract limits 
arbitration to specific exchanges 
the cowen contract states arbitration must be settled in 
accordance with the rules of the amex new york stock exchange or 
national association of securities dealers the court interpreted 
rules to include the amex constitution 
arbitration agreements are contracts and their meaning is to 
be determined from the language employed by the parties under 
accepted rules of contract law the court said 
the federal 2nd us circuit court of appeals earlier this year 
closed the socalled amex window in two cases stating that the 
contract language restricted arbitration the industry forums 
matthew farley an attorney for cowen said the ruling would not 
resolve the issue of where customers can arbitrate their claims 
because it was limited to the language of the cowen contract 
i take some comfort in the fact that the court did not choose 
to issue a broad public pronouncement farley said so i dont 
think it has any universal application that its such a dire event 
for the industry 
but eppenstein said many brokerage contracts use the same 
language as in cowens and many states choose to follow new york 
state law on securities issues 
in a brief filed on behalf of cowen the securities industry 
association said many members have arbitration agreements 
similar to cowens 
the group said the ruling will affect the contracts of many of 
our members and hundreds of thousands of their customers and have 
major implications for the securities industry 
a spokesman for the sia could not be reached for comment amex 
associate general counsel scott noah said he not read the decision 
yet and could not comment 
the securities and exchange commission is considering an amex 
proposal to clarify its constitution to give customers the right to 
go to the aaa only if their contracts do not limit arbitration to 
the industry forums

budget bargaining between the bush 
administration and congressional leaders is resuming with 
participants hoping they can make a deal before congress takes its 
august recess 
the negotiators held their first session tuesday since june 29 
when congress began a fourth of july break they spent most of 
their time discussing possible changes in the budget process but 
planned to return today to an exploration of possible spending cuts 
the bargainers are trying to find at least 50 billion in new 
taxes and spending reductions for fiscal 1991 which starts oct 1 
lawmakers worry that with this years congressional session cut 
short for election campaigning they need to work out a deal soon 
to allow enough time to enact their package into law 
if we dont make a deal before the recess were not likely to 
make a quick deal after the recess said a negotiator rep bill 
frenzel rminn 
federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan told republican 
senators meantime that a solid multiyear deficitcutting deal 
would be a major boost in lowering interest rates participants 
said 
greenspans luncheon comments cheered boosters of a budget pact 
who have long argued that such a package would benefit the economy 
by producing lower interest rates 
meanwhile the administration reiterated its support for a 
balanced budget amendment to the constitution telling congress it 
would support such a measure when the full house votes on it next 
tuesday house democratic leaders oppose the proposal and expect to 
defeat it 
a requirement for a balanced budget would cut government 
borrowing which simply passes costs onto future generations in the 
form of loans that must be repaid said white house budget director 
richard darman 
although the voters of the present are extremely 
wellrepresented in our democratic system the voters of the future 
are not darman told the house judiciary economic and commercial 
law subcommittee 
but subcommittee chairman jack brooks dtexas said such an 
amendment would simply require what everyone wants a balanced 
budget but not provide any help in achieving the difficult goal 
why dont we pass a constitutional amendment that simply 
declares that we shall have clean air henceforth well have a 
drugfree society and aids shall no longer be a menace to 
society brooks said

after weeks of debt negotiations with 
bankers donald trump now has to deal with about 150 
subcontractors who claim the developer owes them 70 million for 
their work on his taj mahal casino resort 
on tuesday the subcontractors elected a sevenperson committee 
to negotiate the alleged overdue payments in a threehour meeting 
that included trump officials the group refused to discuss the 
talks 
before the meeting atlantic plate glass executive marty 
rosenberg whose company is owed 11 million said trump officials 
had offered to resolve the dispute but he said i do not feel it 
is a fair offer 
trump offered to pay 20 million in cash to the contractors but 
wanted to use noninterestbearing notes to pay the remaining 50 
million over the next five years according to todays editions of 
the press of atlantic city 
the newspaper quoted unidentified sources as saying trump 
offered an immediate payment of 5 million to a number of the 
smaller creditors and 15 million to the remaining creditors in two 
installments one this month and one in august 
although some of the subcontractors had promised to discuss the 
negotiations with the media they clammed up midway through the 
meeting shortly after trump officials entered the discussions 
trump attorney nicholas ribis also refused to comment on 
tuesdays talks at merv griffins resorts casino hotel which is 
next door to the taj mahal on the boardwalk 
the dispute with the contractors follows reports that trump is 
suffering from a severe cash crunch caused by the enormous debt on 
his casinos and real estate properties he negotiated a deal with 
banks last month that allowed him to meet a 43 million payment to 
holders of highyield junk bonds backing another casino the trump 
castle 
the taj mahal the citys largest casino has averaged daily 
gross gaming revenues of just under 12 million a day since its 
april 2 opening analysts have said it needed about 13 million a 
day to break even 
larger contractors are watching the progress of the negotiations 
with the smaller contractors before deciding how to claim the 30 
million they contend trump owes them 
its something that has been going on for some time said 
attorney noah bronkesh who represents avalon commercial corp 
which laid down tiles marble and carpeting in the casino avalon 
was not at the meeting tuesday 
people are getting restless bronkesh said theyre tired 
of waiting were probably going to have some action by weeks 
end 
trump has been sued three times in connection with construction 
work on the taj one of the plaintiffs is molded fiber glass of 
ashtabula ohio which built the minarets and onion domes patterned 
after the casinos namesake a 17th century white marble mausoleum

the head of the international monetary fund on 
wednesday urged east european countries to move quickly toward 
market economies 
but michel camdessus imf managing director said the financial 
institution would not divert resources away from the third world to 
help the fledgling democracies in east europe 
he told a news conference that the 152nation fund might be able 
to provide technical assistance to the soviet union although that 
country would not qualify for direct financial aid 
leaders of the seven industrialized nations at the economic 
summit in houston have proposed the imf take part in a detailed 
study of soviet economic needs 
camdessus who was in geneva to speak to the united nations 
economic and social council outlined a series of recommendations 
for east european countries moving away from centrally planned 
economies 
warning against half measures he stressed market reform 
programs must be introduced as rapidly as possible and must be as 
general as possible for them to succeed 
you cant take a little liberalization of prices a little 
autonomy of enterprises a little less state regulation because 
that doesnt work he said 
he also emphasized the need for a social safety net to 
cushion the impact of the reforms on vulnerable sectors of the 
population 
the passage to a market economy does not create poverty but 
it reveals it the characteristics of a centralized economy are 
unemployment and inflation in waiting when you liberalize prices 
these increase he said 
the washingtonbased imf provides loans to third world countries 
in exchange for promises of economic reform the fund currently has 
about 175 billion

some 2300 workers on wednesday ended a 14week 
strike at waterford wedgwood group plcs crystalmaking operations 
in ireland the company said 
waterford said it would begin phasing in production wednesday 
night 
the plant shut down april 5 when workers refused to implement a 
costcutting plan the company has suffered losses in the past 
three years partly because of a weaker dollar and its dependence 
on the us market 
workers now have accepted some of the cost cuts and management 
and the unions have agreed to refer issues still in dispute to 
binding arbitration the company said 
in a statement waterford wedgwood chairman paddy byrne said 
whilst i am obviously pleased that a formula has been agreed that 
allows a return to work it must be recognized that we still have a 
long way to go in order to transform waterford crystal into a 
robust and profitable part of waterford wedgwood group 
until this is achieved the future of the crystal division 
will not be secure he said

the british pound lost 175 cents after zooming to an 18month 
high of 18155 dollars tuesday 
dealers agreed there was room for a modest correction of the 
pound which moved strongly on speculation that britain will soon 
enter the exchange rate mechanism of the european monetary system 
designed to curb exchange rate fluctuations 
however they said the pound should remain firm because of the 
governmentimposed 15 percent base interest rate on bank lending to 
curb inflation the high interest rate continues to attract 
investor money to london 
one british pound cost 17980 in london late wednesday cheaper 
for buyers than tuesdays 18155 at midday in new york sterling 
was quoted at 179825

gold bullion prices rose by 70 cents in london and 20 cents in 
zurich after declines of 4 tuesday on reports that between 10 and 
15 tons of the metal had been unloaded by middle east sources

consumers and some professional interest but investor interest was 
still lacking and there was general resistance to gold going much 
above the 355 level 
in london the major market the late bid price of gold was 
35445 a troy ounce up from 35375 the late bid price in zurich

the equal employment opportunity commission has 
filed a federal lawsuit charging that united parcel service 
discriminated against employees on the basis of religion 
the lawsuit said greenwich connbased ups has failed to allow 
a religious exception to the companys practice of prohibiting 
employees with beards from working in positions that deal with the 
public 
the lawsuit filed tuesday in a chicago federal court alleges 
ups violated title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 by failing 
to accommodate the religious practices of employees and job 
applicants the act prohibits employment discrimination based on 
race religion sex or national origin 
title vii requires that an employer try to reasonably 
accommodate employees or applicants religious beliefs or 
practices whenever the employer can do so without incurring undue 
hardship said zachary tobin trial lawyer for the eeocs chicago 
office 
the commission is seeking back pay and job offers for people 
denied consideration for public contact positions because they wear 
beards for religious reasons the eeoc also is asking for an 
injunction to prevent ups from engaging in any employment practices 
which discriminate on the basis of religion 
the classaction lawsuit was sparked by a complaint the 
commission received a year ago from former ups employee ayub patel 
whose request to become a ups driver was denied tobin said 
but anyone who has ever worked or applied for a job with ups 
could seek relief if this lawsuit prevails tobin said 
efforts today to obtain comment from a ups spokesman at its 
connecticut headquarters were unsuccessful

american airlines inc is adding 1 to 
4 to the cost of a ticket at five airports to help pay for what it 
calls exorbitant and intolerable fees at airports 
other airlines said they would not follow the lead of the 
nations largest carrier and analysts dont expect the surcharges 
to establish a norm within the industry 
i dont see that as any particular trend said lee howard 
vice president of consulting firm airline economics inc in 
washington it deals with a specific issue which has arisen and 
american airlines has chosen to see that way as covering what they 
consider to be excessive expenses 
al becker spokesman for fort worthbased american said the 
increased charges will amount to about 4 million a year they will 
take effect sunday at new yorks laguardia airport newark 
international airport new orleans international airport palm 
beach international airport in west palm beach fla and southwest 
florida regional in fort myers fla 
the fees range from 4 per ticket in newark to 150 in new 
orleans and 1 for the other three airports analysts doubted the 
increases would affect americans business because they are small 
compared to average ticket prices of 200 
the fees will be applied only to local boardings at those 
airports so they will not affect people passing through or coming 
home the company said 
its very simple and straightforward becker said at 
those five airports we are covering what we believe to be excessive 
and unreasonable costs it only makes good business sense to do 
that 
becker said increases involve budget overages or charges at 
those specific airports that go far beyond what they ought to be 
becker said 
at laguardia for example the complaint involves a floor 
covering used in renovations 
american is not trying to exert control over budgets at local 
airports becker said but we are in the position of explaining 
to the airports what we believe is fair and equitable based on our 
experience 
there is simply no way that we can tolerate those sorts of 
unreasonable charges said becker who noted that two or three 
years ago american implemented a similar surcharge at the las vegas 
airport because the local airport authority wanted to build an 
outlandishly extravagant new terminal 
in the end the airport changed its plans he said 
the fees however did not sit well with some groups 
american is attempting to make the public think that the 
surcharge is the airports fault said robert inman properties 
manager for palm beach international inman said the fees american 
pays at west palm beach actually will drop by 14 percent beginning 
in october 
this is a gimmick to justify increased fares charged david 
blackshear director of airports for new orleans 
consumer advocate david livingston president of airline 
passengers of north america also objected to the surcharge 
every time the price of a legal pad goes up you dont 
automatically pass it on to the client he said 
becker said the surcharges are unrelated to a bill pending in 
congress that would allow airports to charge up to 3 in 
passenger facility charges 
airports would be allowed to collect the fees to increase 
capacity enhance safety or security or reduce noise 
american is one of the airlines supporting the legislation 
according to bob bunnell spokesman for the airport operators 
council international a trade group in washington 
american the principal subsidiary of amr corp last year had 
996 billion in revenues and earned 7308 million

inside a cluster of plush buildings 
baked by the silicon valley sun apple computer inc employees 
wearing sport shirts and jeans are readying products they hope will 
revive the companys breathtaking growth 
their casual dress and californiaready smiles belie the 
seriousness of their task to overcome a major challenge to apples 
main product the macintosh and revamp what critics call a tired 
overpriced product line the combination has caused sales growth to 
slow and apples stock price to falter 
the personal computer giant hatched in a garage 14 years ago 
also must dispel the appearance of instability created by recent 
leadership changes 
since january apple lost its productdevelopment chief and the 
president of its domestic marketing operation in addition its top 
us sales executive moved to parttime status and a senior 
scientist who helped develop the macintosh announced earlier this 
month he was quitting to form his own company 
there is nothing technically wrong with apples products and 
it has plenty of room for growth said richard shaffer publisher 
of technologic computer letter an industry newsletter but the 
company has taken too long to get some products out and it has not 
had its marketing act together 
although apple remains one of americas most dynamic and least 
indebted young companies the executive changes havent helped 
answer the persistent question of whos in charge 
you cant have the management turnover like they had at apple 
without problems shaffer said 
last month apple finally named a new president for the domestic 
division an important post vacant for six months robert puette a 
longtime hewlettpackard co executive expressed confidence in his 
new employer 
i think the turmoil is going to pretty well disappear and 
youre going to see some strong marketing messages from the 
company he said 
those messages will be needed since apple must respond to the 
most serious threat yet to the macintoshs primacy 
the 6yearold computer is acclaimed for a graphicsbased 
operating system that makes it easy even for computer novices to 
run the machines as soon as they take them out of the box 
the macintosh popularized the use of an onscreen arrow 
manipulated with a device called a mouse by moving the arrow to 
pictures on the screen and pushing a button on the mouse users can 
open computer files print copies and perform other tasks 
by comparison on most international business machines corp 
computers and ibmcompatible models users must type technical 
commands 
but in may microsoft corp released a muchimproved version of 
a software product called windows which replaces the typed 
commands with userfriendly graphics also manipulated by a mouse 
though the macintosh is still easier to use in some respects 
and windows cant be used on all ibm computers and compatibles 
many analysts believe the new windows gives computer novices and 
others their first real alternative to the macintosh 
another problem facing apple critics say is its pricey 
computers 
the macintosh line is about 25 percent costlier than comparable 
models from ibm and compaq computer corp two major competitors 
said rick martin an analyst at prudentialbache securities inc 
before windows apple could charge a premium for its machines 
because of their relative ease of use martin said 
you take that wide price gap and throw windows on top of it 
and you now have the beginnings of what could be a major problem 
he said 
joeann stahel president of storeboardcomputer intelligence 
said surveys her market research firm takes of computer dealers 
show that lowering the price of macintoshes is a priority 
the dealers were very concered about apples pricing in a 
market where youve got such heavy competiton from the ibm pc 
compatibles she said 
last month ibm announced a new home computer line that could 
spell more trouble for apple the machines feature a mouse and 
onscreen graphics designed to make them easy to use though they 
arent as sophisticated as a macintosh but the low end of the line 
costs 999 vs the cheapest macintosh at 1799 
apple sold 4 billion worth of macintoshes last year by far the 
most important product it offers faced with new assaults apple 
isnt standing still 
later this year the company plans to introduce lowerpriced 
versions of the macintosh with both color and blackandwhite 
screens 
mike homer director of domestic product marketing said a 
lowerpriced macintosh with a color monitor is clearly a hardware 
product hole we have to plug apples cheapest color macintosh 
today lists for 4669 while ibm clones with color screens cost 
thousands less 
to reduce the cost of macintoshes apple most likely will limit 
the number of options on new models and accept a lower profit 
margin said jim davis apples director of operating system 
software 
martin said he expects the new lowend color macintosh will cost 
2000 to 2500 ms stahel said she has heard the lowend 
blackandwhite macintosh will sell for about 1000 apple 
wouldnt comment on pricing plans 
besides lowerpriced computers apple recently introduced 
cheaper laser printers in response to challenges from competitors 
it also is readying a new version of its operating system which 
controls a computers basic functions such as organizing files 
that will enhance the macintoshs performance 
not all apples products need facelifts the company revamped 
the top end of the macintosh line over the past year and says 
sales of these expensive highpowered machines aimed at corporate 
users are strong 
meanwhile apple officials say the hype about windows benefited 
apple since it drew more attention to graphicsbased computing 
systems davis contends the macintosh will win any comparison with 
a windowequipped ibm or compatible computer 
apple executives and industry analysts also point out that the 
library of software that takes advantage of windows capabilities 
is small compared with the several thousand macintosh programs on 
the market 
in coming months apples advertising will more clearly point 
out these differences davis said 
some of the ads in the us were a little fuzzy he said 
shaffer agreed unless apple begins to stress those 
stillimportant differences apple will lose market share he 
said 
infocorp a market research firm that tracks computer sales 
reckons apples sales fell in the first three months of this year 
vs a year earlier but since have picked up analysts say apple 
holds about 10 percent of worldwide personal computer market 
this is hardly apples first slump the companys history has 
been shaped by booms and busts since its founding in a garage by 
steve jobs and steve wozniak in 1976 its current malaise is a mild 
headache compared with the turmoil layoffs and financial losses 
that led to jobs ouster in 1985 
despite the current troubles apples finances are strong the 
company has almost no debt and about 1 billion in cash on hand 
analysts expect its profit will grow at least 10 percent in the 
fiscal year that ends sept 30 
however apples stock price has suffered reflecting some 
pessimism in its ability to continue the quantumleap innovations 
that first made the company a household word in the late 70s 
soon after windows premiered apple shares slumped from the 
mid40s into the high 30s though it recent weeks the stock has 
moved sharply higher 
this company is doing just fine said martin but all the 
turmoil caused investors to be very very nervous

the bush administration says the most useful 
thing it can do now for the soviet union rather than send cold 
hard cash is to give their leaders a few lessons in good old 
american knowhow 
as the sevennation economic summit ended in houston president 
bush said he had cabled soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
asking to explain the summits decision to send technical 
assistance to moscow and commission a study of the soviet unions 
economic needs 
ill make clear to president gorbachev that he ought to view 
the outcome of this summit very positively bush told a news 
conference what he can expect is that well be helpful to him in 
the kinds of reforms that he has to undertake 
bush balked at sending direct us assistance to the soviets and 
repeated his criticism of their 5 billion annual support of 
marxist cuba i think we will send the kind of help that in the 
long run will be most beneficial to them he said 
sending experts abroad to help needy countries known as 
technical assistance in foreignpolicy jargon has been a 
centerpiece of the us foreign aid program for years and now it 
is a feature of the new spirit of cooperation between the 
superpowers 
some allies including west germany and france hoped the united 
states and other industrial democracies would go much further and 
agree at the economic summit in houston to fashion a coordinated 
package of direct assistance to the reeling soviet economy 
bush among others resisted the dispute was blunted for the 
time being when the seven summit partners agreed instead tuesday 
to organize a quick study of the soviet unions needs 
meanwhile the summit leaders gave gorbachev a warm endorsement 
and pledged to help in practical ways those countries that choose 
freedom 
the final communique issued at the close of the summit today 
said prospects for fundamental and longterm economic aid could 
improve if the soviet union comes to a substantial change in 
resources from military to civilian production and ends the 
support to those states which create regional conflict 
the western leaders called for group of international financial 
institutions under international monetary fund supervision to 
conduct the soviet study and complete it by years end but the 
world bank part of that group immediately pronounced the deadline 
unrealistic saying a study of this nature would take a long time 
a year or so 
in the interim for the united states to extend even technical 
assistance is a gesture that is downright revolutionary when 
measured by the standards of just 8 years ago 
after the polish governments crackdown with soviet 
acquiescence on the solidarity labor union in december 1981 the 
western allies were debating how severely to punish the soviets 
economically now the debate is focused on how much the kremlin 
should be rewarded for its change of heart under mikhail 
gorbachevs stewardship 
bush and gorbachev set in motion the concept of us technical 
assistance at the malta summit seven months ago officials now say 
an acceleration of that cooperation may be possible 
technical assistance can cover a variety of different endeavors 
in panama it means helping the government form a new police force 
in nicaragua us experts are helping to implement the 
governments economic policy in el salvador american advisers are 
trying to upgrade the countrys woefully deficient judicial system 
the us position on the soviet union is that direct aid would 
merely be wasted by a system plagued by gross inefficiencies baker 
said on tuesday the biggest favor the west could do for the soviets 
would be to offer its advice to help gorbachev achiev his goal of 
streamlining the soviet economy a number of private experts agree 
with that approach 
some ideas which are at various stages of discussion include 
helping the soviets devise a consumer price index and a stock 
market in a transition to a market economy 
leon aron of the heritage foundation a conservative research 
group said the united states is uniquely positioned among the 
allies to offer advice on these areas to a country as large as the 
soviet union because of the scale of the us economy 
aron rejected the suggestion of some european nations that 
direct financial aid to the soviet union is feasible he said that 
because of systemic inefficiencies there is 8 billion worth of 
imported equipment languishing unopened in soviet ports 
a blank check is wasted he said 
ed a hewitt of the brookings institution said us experts 
could aid the soviets in overcoming such problems as getting food 
to the market place about a third of all soviet food rots before 
reaching the dinner table because of inadequate transportation or 
storage facilities he said 
both hewitt and richard feinberg executive vice president of 
the overseas development council strongly support a major role for 
the world bank and international monetary fund in helping the 
soviets 
financial stabilization and structural changes are sorely needed 
in the soviet union and are precisely the areas the bank and the 
fund have been set up to deal with feinberg said 
the imf makes loans to developing countries providing they agree 
to undertake measures that it believes are necessary to put them on 
a sounder economic footing 
feinberg says that among the imfs success stories are turkey 
mexico bolivia and chile critics argue that imf policies have 
impoverished some countries 
the soviets are not now in a position to benefit from the fund 
or the bank because they are not members of either institution but 
they have indicated a desire to join and the bush administration 
reportedly is weighing options on the subject 
there are other ways the united states could help the soviets 
short of direct assistance 
as an example if the kremlins drop barriers to emigration the 
united states could waive the socalled jacksonvanik amendment 
thereby permitting normal trade between the two countries 
that step in turn could be followed by us trade credits and 
the easing of high technology exports the soviets may act on the 
emigration question in september 
will direct us aid ever be in the cards 
i dont think you should ever say never baker said tuesday 
things can change

federal regulators are considering filing a 
negligence lawsuit against president bushs son neil and other 
former directors of a failed colorado savings and loan a 
government spokesman says 
meanwhile the office of thrift supervision released documents 
charging that neil bush engaged in one of the worst kinds of 
conflict of interest when he served as an outside director of 
silverado banking savings and loan association of denver 
president bush reiterated today his confidence in the honor 
and integrity of his son and renewed his promise not to interfere 
with the regulators investigation 
if hes done something wrong the system will digest that 
the president told a news conference in houston following the 
economic summit this is not easy for me as a father its easy 
for me as a president i am determined to stay out of this 
the ots documents revealed new details of silverados 
operations alleging in specific cases that bush violated his 
responsibility as a director to see that the thrift was run in the 
best interests of its shareholders 
the regulators said bush did everything in his power to bring 
about a regulatory violation the reason no violation occurred was 
beyond his control bushs conduct was clearly contrary to 
generally accepted standards of prudent operation 
the documents also alleged that bush was unqualified and 
untrained for his position as a silverado director 
certainly he had no experience in managing a large 
corporation especially a financial institution with almost 2 
billion in assets the documents said unfortunately he was 
not cognizant of the conflictofinterest situations he encountered 
as a director of silverado inexperience does not excuse neil 
bush from the harm and potential harm he caused 
silverados december 1988 collapse is expected to cost taxpayers 
an estimated 1 billion 
bush 34 has denied any wrongdoing he said tuesday in an 
interview with the associated press in denver that he and the 
collapsed thrift were victimized by a system that was doomed to 
fail has failed and will continue to fail 
a 200 million suit against former directors of silverado has 
been authorized by william seidman chairman of the federal deposit 
insurance corp abc news reported tuesday 
but fdic spokesman alan whitney said the suit is still under 
consideration he declined to comment on the 200 million figure or 
to provide any other details 
no final decision to bring such a suit has been made 
whitney said he said its not uncommon for the fdic to file 
suits against directors in cases of savings and loan failure 
bush told abc he was not aware of an fdic lawsuit against him 
his attorney james nesland said after the broadcast he also was 
unaware of any pending suit 
in one of the most highly publicized thrift collapses the fdic 
last year filed a 13 billion suit against charles keating jr and 
other directors of the failed lincoln savings and loan of irvine 
calif 
neil bush has been ordered by regulators to answer allegations 
of conflict of interest in his role as a director of silverado 
which loaned millions of dollars to a bush business partner who 
never repaid the money 
bush said tuesday the investigation by regulators is 
selfserving 
the regulators are politically motivated he told the ap in 
denver 
bush said he had performed properly and that all loans that 
came before the directors were for projects previously approved by 
others more knowledgeable than he 
several former silverado executives have settled charges with 
regulators and have effectively been barred from future positions 
in the thrift and banking industry 
ots has alleged that bush who served on the board of silverado 
from august 1985 to august 1988 voted to approve loans or business 
deals totaling more than 45 million to a business partner bill l 
walters 
an administrative law judge is scheduled to hear the bush case 
sept 25 in denver before making a recommendation to ots director 
timothy ryan 
abc said the lawsuit would charge that the negligence of 
silverados directors partly caused the losses the network quoted 
an unnamed source as saying that the negligence was particularly 
egregious 
it said the suit would contend the silverado directors acted 
irresponsibly in approving dozens of questionable loans the 
evidence for the suit abc said includes a memo in which a top 
silverado executive acknowledged that the board was a rubber 
stamp for the thrifts officers when it approved several loans 
bush and other former directors and officers of silverado 
testified in hearings in may and june before the house banking 
committee 
president bush who has pledged to vigorously prosecute fraud in 
the savings and loan industry has said he has full confidence in 
the integrity and honor of his son the president also has 
promised not to interfere with the investigation 
the ots documents alleging conflict of interest by neil bush 
were first disclosed in reports by the denver post the rocky 
mountain news and the washington post

grain and soybean futures prices retreated 
wednesday on the chicago board of trade as some analysts increased 
their corn and soybean production forecasts in light of beneficial 
crop weather in the midwest 
last week for example market analysts were projecting a us 
corn crop of 76 billion to 77 billion bushels 
but by wednesday some observers were predicting a corn harvest 
of as much as 83 billion bushels said william biedermann 
research director with the commodities brokerage allendale inc in 
crystal lake ill 
those kind of numbers scared speculators out of the 
marketplace he said 
analysts are increasing their production estimates because 
weather conditions in the midwest have been ideal for crop 
development after an unusually wet spring 
the weather in the main corn belt and the main soybean belt is 
absolutely perfect at the moment said john frazier director of 
agricultural futures trading for gerald inc in chicago 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cents to 3 cents lower with 
july at 304 a bushel corn was 3 cents to 4 cents lower with 
july at 279 a bushel oats were 3 cents to 5 cents lower with 
july at 125 a bushel soybeans were 4 cents to 10 cents lower

federal officials are considering lawsuits to 
recover misspent funds from the officers and directors of 1300 
failed banks and savings institutions a top regulator said today 
l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp said suits already have been filed against 500 institutions 
approximately 100 million was recovered last year and more than 
200 million in the first half of this year he said 
that is in excess of 1 million per day in recoveries in 
1990 he said 
the agencys officials said one suit under consideration would 
be against the former officers and directors of silverado banking 
savings and loan association a denver thrift whose december 1988 
collapse cost taxpayers approximately 1 billion 
one of president bushs sons neil would be among the 
defendants 
separately fbi officials announced in dallas that they have 
charged the former chairman of a texas savings and loan with fraud 
edward t mcbirney iii former president of sunbelt savings 
association one of the texas costliest failures was indicted in 
connection with a 700 million real estate scheme 
seidmans remarks came in testimony prepared for the house 
judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice chaired by rep charles 
schumer dny the panel is reviewing a package of reforms 
designed to speed the governments antifraud effort 
the legislation a version of which was passed by a house 
banking subcommittee two weeks ago was endorsed by seidman office 
of thrift supervision director timothy ryan and james g richmond 
a newly appointed justice department official in charge of 
prosecuting bank and thrift fraud 
it would provide more money to hire investigators and attorneys 
to prosecute fraud prevent people convicted of fraud from evading 
restitution by filing for bankruptcy and allow regulators and 
prosecutors to ask a judge to freeze the assets of those accused of 
fraud even before they are found guilty 
in another development the board of the resolution trust corp 
voted 40 tuesday to adopt a new strategy trying to save 
taxpayers money by closing troubled thrifts just before rather 
than after the institutions fail 
seidman said the new accelerated resolutions program will 
become the preferred course of action for handling failing 
thrifts 
officials estimate they could use the program for between 155 
and 180 of the 260 sampls expected to fail over the next year they 
plan to see how it works with 10 institutions over the summer 
congress has been holding hearings on sampl fraud for months but 
the issue in recent weeks has become politically charged with 
democrats and republicans each blaming the other for creating the 
crisis democrats have been hammering particularly hard at 
conflictofinterest allegations made by regulators against neil 
bush 
the office of thrift supervision released documents charging 
that neil bush engaged in one of the worst kinds of conflict of 
interest when he served as an outside director of silverado the 
documents alleged in specific cases that bush violated his 
responsibility as a director to see that the thrift was run in the 
best interests of its shareholders 
schumer in his opening remarks acknowledged that the sampl issue 
had become politicized but he said if the flames of partisan 
passions lit a fire under the administration to prosecute sampl 
thieves so be it 
there is a volcano of frustration among the american people 
that these white collar crooks are going unprosecuted i am very 
worried that if the government cannot prosecute these huge crimes 
fully and efficiently there will be an eruption of real anger and 
cynicism from the american people he said 
richmond the justice departments special counsel for financial 
institutions said we are acutely aware that the american people 
want the savings and loan wrongdoers swiftly and appropriately 
punished we do too 
seidman said fraud has been discovered in about half of the 460 
sampls seized by the government since february 1989 in 40 percent of 
the institutions fraud contributed significantly to an sampls 
failure he said 
many were owned or dominated by one individual and operated 
more like real estate development organizations investment banks 
or mutual funds than thrift institutions he said this 
situation allows for abuse and lack of control

the new managing editor of entertainment weekly 
says readers can expect more changes at the fivemonthold startup 
magazine that has become one of the industrys most closelywatched 
launches 
james w seymore jr took over the top editorial post at the new 
magazine from time warner inc last month after the founding 
managing editor jeff jarvis resigned over creative 
differences with senior management 
entertainment weekly has commanded intense interest since its 
launch in february because it is the first weekly from the time 
inc magazine co since the costly failure of its tvcable week 
magazine in 1983 
it also is being watched to see how evenhanded a publication 
can be when it is offering opinions on movies music and the like 
from sister companies and their competitors 
media analysts also wonder how patient debtheavy time warner 
will be for the magazine to become profitable time warner has a 
106 billion debt resulting from time incs purchase last year of 
warner communications inc 
magazine executives refuse to disclose how the magazine is doing 
financially startup costs reportedly were more than 30 million 
publisher michael j klingensmith said it is on target with an 
average 600000 circulation and is ahead of projections in ad 
revenues despite a weak market 
jarvis and klingensmith are credited for separately conceiving 
the concept for the magazine six years ago entertainment weeklys 
mission would be to give busy people a onestop guide on how to 
entertain themselves 
the heart of the magazine has been reviews of entertainment 
products television movies music videos books and magazines 
feature stories focused on how the products were made not gossip 
about the celebrities in them 
after less than three weeks on the new job seymore said in an 
interview that reviews would remain the centerpiece but added the 
magazine has a wider mandate 
he wants more feature and news coverage of entertainment such 
as the magazines recent stories on tvs use of fbi videotapes of 
washington dc mayor marion barrys drug arrest 
seymore wants more information on the opinion pages than readers 
have been getting to help them decide what might be worthwhile to 
watch read or hear 
and he said readers can look for shorter reviews and features 
some staffers feared jarvis departure meant the magazine would 
become another version of people the personality magazine also 
from time warner 
but seymore 47 the former executive editor of people said 
that isnt his intention our focus will be strictly and 
exclusively on entertainment and informing people about what is 
going on he said 
seymore said he generally agrees with the design changes 
implemented a few weeks before jarvis resigned on june 11 
the magazine was redesigned in late may in what senior managers 
said was a response to complaints from readers and advertisers that 
the magazine was cluttered and hard to read 
the cover was simplified the logo straightened and a column 
that ran along the edge of each cover touting other stories was 
dropped the news amp notes columns that ran along the edges of 
each section were given separate pages at the end of each section 
a bolder typeface and heavier paper were used 
the magazine also adopted a new approach to choosing cover 
topics instead of running covers relating to products just being 
released cover stories now will focus on products that have been 
out for awhile 
the old approach left the magazine with some arcane and esoteric 
covers such as one about vietnam novels said the magazine groups 
editorial director richard stolley the new approach will mean 
more mainstream covers which could help sales he said 
jarvis declined comment on his reasons for resigning 
his colleagues say he chafed under senior managments heavy 
involvement in the magazine and felt it was becomimg too 
celebrityoriented 
stolley and the magazine groups editor in chief jason mcmanus 
and corporate editor gilbert rogin became involved in editing and 
layout for four to five weeks before jarvis decided to resign 
analysts remain divided on the magazines prospects 
magazine consultant martin s walker said the original magazine 
covered too many subjects and was too intellectual to attract a 
mass audience every week walker also thinks it is too late to save 
it 
but john gray a top media planner at the ad agency j walter 
thompson said he remains bullish on the magazine there is a 
tendency to expect that a new magazine will come out of the womb 
already perfect and grown up and thats unrealistic he said

cbs inc said wednesday its secondquarter 
profit rose 16 percent as an improved performance by its 
broadcasting operations offset a decline in interest income 
despite the latest improvement chief executive laurence a 
tisch said the profit outlook remained uncertain because of a 
sluggish national economy intensified competition for viewers and 
increased sports rights costs 
cbs which operates the cbs television network as well as tv and 
radio stations said it earned 138 million or 536 a share in 
the three months ended june 30 compared with 1188 million or 
462 a share a year earlier 
revenue rose 7 percent to 829 million from 772 million a year 
earlier 
operating profit for the broadcast group rose 31 percent to 
1809 million in the quarter as the cbs tv network reported a 
significant increase in operating income because of lower 
primetime programming costs and revenues from added national 
basketball association playoff games 
programming costs had been unusually high in the second quarter 
of 1989 because of the impact of a writers strike the strike 
delayed the start of the 198889 television season and resulted in 
the debut of more firstrun series than normal in the second 
quarter last year adding to programming costs 
this year cbs sports had more broadcasts of nba playoff and 
championship series games boosting secondquarter revenue 
the cbs tv network also benefitted from a secondplace showing 
in the primetime audience ratings during the may sweeps period 
when benchmarks are set for advertising rates the network was 
third for the full season however 
the cbs tv and radio stations each had higher sales and profits 
for the quarter despite softness on local advertising

quarter down from 546 million a year earlier when interest 
income was augmented by a pretax gain of 138 million resulting 
from the sale of securities

teetering trade barriers in the west and the 
opening of closed economies in the east have been making europe as 
a whole the target of us automakers which are moving with 
unaccustomed speed to exploit the market 
general motors corp ford motor co and to a lesser extent 
chrysler corp have engaged in business in europe for years 
but more recently they quickly have been setting up joint 
manufacturing and supply ventures establishing marketing 
associations and buying all or parts of european automakers as the 
continent begins to emerge as the worlds largest auto market 
trade barriers among the 12member european economic community 
are to be eliminated in 1992 creating an auto market larger than 
north america 
the market would swell further if free trade agreements are 
reached between the dozen ec members and other western and eastern 
european nations 
general motors ford and chrysler each facing weakening 
performances at home increasingly are looking to europe as a 
source of profits and a market for excess us manufacturing 
capacity 
auto analyst david healy of the investment banking firm 
barclays de zoete wedd in new york said tuesday he expected the 
european market to grow to about 13 million cars this year 
generous estimates put the us car market at about 10 million for 
1990 
its something thats a good deal bigger in just passenger 
cars than the united states healy said sales have grown a lot 
over the last few years but have sort of leveled out this year 
theres potential growth in the european minivan and 
sportutility segments 
chrysler which sparked the popularity of minivans in the united 
states has signed an agreement with steyrdaimlerpuch to make 
minivans in austria beginning in spring 1991 executives have said 
the project also may market righthand drive vehicles for the 
united kingdom 
i think there is going to be a scramble to either introduce 
those vans from the united states or companies building them on 
their own healy said this is something coming very rapidly 
historically automakers have wanted to build vehicles where 
they sell them that way they can react quicker to market changes 
avoid import duties and attempt to lessen the stigma of a foreign 
company invading the homeland 
japanese automakers have used the strategy with great success in 
the united states where they faced pressure to restrict imports 
seven japanese companies now operate us transplants with 
honda motor co ltd having opened the first in november 1982 in 
marysville ohio 
the big three have a much older history in europe ford opened a 
british assembly plant in 1911 three years after establishing a 
sales branch in france and the same year gm set up an exporting 
company 
since then ford and gm have grown substantially in europe each 
now has sales or manufacturing operations in more than a dozen 
western european nations chrysler has had a small sales presence 
on the continent 
in 1988 the latest figures available from the motor vehicle 
manufacturers association about 37 percent of fords worldwide 
production came from its european operations and 25 percent of gms 
came from the region 
recent moves have stepped up the pace of european operations 
gm acquired half of swedens saab automobile ab signed an 
agreement to begin making cars in east germany later this year and 
agreed to a 150 million investment in a hungarian vehicle making 
plant 
ford spent 25 billion to acquire the british 
luxuryperformance car maker jaguar plc and has announced that it 
is involved in negotiations focusing on heavy truck and farm 
implement manufacturing with the huge italian company fiat group 
also gm and the soviet automaker volga auto works have signed a 
1 billion deal under which gm will supply pollution and engine 
control systems to the soviet company 
it does provide a very good foundation from which to start to 
learn how to do business learn how to find hotel rooms and make 
telephone calls william hoglund gms executive vice president 
said last month in announcing the deal 
sixteen months ago ford left a consortium of companies looking 
into joint ventures with soviet businesses and is not involved in 
any discussions in that nation now 
at the time of its withdrawal ford said a primary problem was 
finding a way to convert profits paid in soviet rubles into 
currency traded in international markets 
convertibility problems also faced us companies interested in 
moving into east germany but the recent unification of the west 
and east german marks eliminated that hurdle 
in march gm signed an agreement to begin making cars this 
october in east germany for the east german market about 10000 
cars will be made this year and production will increase to about 
150000 annually by the mid1990s 
thats a modest production by us standards but is expected to 
help meet the automobile supply problem in east germany where 
citizens sometimes wait more than half a year for delivery

yorks commodity exchange with the contract for delivery in july at

contract since may 11 
prices shot up from the opening bell in reaction to a sharp 
increase in copper prices on the london metal exchange that 
analysts attributed to strong buying from west germany 
market ruors linked the buying to a west german company said to 
be part of a consortium trying to buy a large stateowned copper 
mine in cananea mexico 
the german firm was believed to have sold forward contracts in 
london earlier because it believed the mexican government would 
accept the groups bid for the mine 
but a mexican court blocked the transaction citing a law 
forbidding foreign ownership of natural resources according to the 
market rumors 
the ruling was said to have forced the german company to cover 
its market position in london by buying forward contracts which 
caused a massive runup in london said james steel a metals 
analysts with refco inc in new york 
the market was further supported by reports of declining 
warehouse stocks of copper and by production problems in zambia 
analysts said 
bette raptopoulos an analyst with prudentialbache securities 
inc also cited a report that peruvian miners have threatened to 
strike monday at a small stateowned mine and a large peruvian 
copper refinery

stretched into its 11th day wednesday adding another bullish 
factor

of trade as some analysts increased their corn and soybean 
production forecasts in light of beneficial crop weather in the 
midwest 
last week for example market analysts were projecting a us 
corn crop of 76 billion to 77 billion bushels 
but by wednesday some observers were predicting a corn harvest 
of as much as 83 billion bushels said william biedermann 
research director with the commodities brokerage allendale inc in 
crystal lake ill 
those kind of numbers scared speculators out of the 
marketplace he said 
a national weather service forecast released after the close 
predicted seasonal temperatures and normal to abovenormal rainfall 
in the midwest during the latter half of next week 
wheat futures prices settled unchanged to 3 cents lower with

the federal national mortgage association the 
nations largest investor in home mortgages said wednesday its 
income rose in the second quarter largely due to a drop in 
foreclosures 
fannie mae reported secondquarter earnings of 2896 million 
or 110 a share compared with 193 million or 75 cents a share 
a year earlier 
this was a very successful quarter said david o maxwell 
fannie maes chairman and chief executive officer continued 
strength in fannie maes portfolio and mortgagebacked securities 
business helped generate our 10th consecutive quarter of record 
earnings 
for the first six months of 1990 the federally chartered 
corporation reported income of 5662 million up from 3582 
million for the same period in 1989

average investment balance a 4 basis point rise in net interest 
margin and an 83 million rise in mortgagebacked security 
guaranty fees said fannie mae president and chief operating 
officer roger birk 
in addition the number of foreclosures was greatly reduced to

once it was a dying lumber town in rural 
michigan best known for the 14 bars on muddy main street 
that was the midland of the turn of the century when a 
fledgling chemical company called dow decided to set up shop there 
today the city of 37000 about 100 miles north of detroit 
lives and breathes dow chemical co the company provides jobs 
taxes foundation money and an international ambience shared by few 
other small midwest cities 
but it also spews fumes that smell faintly of solvent and 
discharges treated wastewater into the local river prompting 
warnings that anglers shouldnt eat too many bottom fish 
nonetheless the chemistry between dow and midland seems to 
work in many respects it serves as a modernday model for the 
relationship between a city and a major employer midlanders say 
we would perhaps be nonexistent if dow had not come here and 
established this chemical company assistant city manager david 
wirth said 
dow chemical has grown into michigans fourthlargest 
manufacturer and a global giant since it was founded in 1897 and 
it has taken midland along for the ride 
it all started with herbert henry dow who came to town in 1887 
after getting a chemistry degree at clevelands case institute of 
technology 
major commerce in those days was a fading timber industry that 
had surged as chicago rebuilt after its disastrous fire of 1871 
dow tried something new he began his business by drilling brine 
wells and using electric charges to separate chemicals like 
chlorine bromine and sodium hydroxide still the main ingredient 
in dow oven cleaner 
many of the people who came here with dr dow and supported 
him and started off with him became comfortably well off said 
catherine cummins of the midland historical society instead of 
moving to italy with a big boat or living in new york many of them 
are still in town 
dow with 55500 workers worldwide employs about a quarter of 
midland countys labor force of 35250 
the michigan division of midland serves as a research and 
specialty division producing things like latex and aspirin powder 
items that historically have withstood economic whims 
other michigan cities havent been so fortunate 
take the automaking town of flint about 50 miles south of 
midland during the recession year of 1982 flints unemployment 
rate averaged 211 percent vs 127 percent for midland 
over the past 2 years flints jobless rate has seesawed 
between 82 percent and 185 percent midlands unemployment ranged 
from a high of 85 percent in january 1988 to 44 percent last 
november 
theyre midland residents really sheltered from the cyclical 
sensitivity of the automotive industry said sandra st cyr an 
analyst for the michigan employment security commission 
dow also provides a tax shelter of sorts for midland residents 
by making up a quarter of the citys 13 billion tax base 
midland has at least 10 foundations endowed by dows founders 
that pay for good schools and libraries a busy theatrical and arts 
center and a botanical garden 
the relatively low jobless rate coupled with the abundance of 
educated dow professionals that have become attracted to midlands 
schools and cultural activities has helped keep the citys crime 
rate low some residents contend 
i dont think theres a crack house in town said patrick 
dean a midland police officer since 1963 who once served as acting 
police chief its been six or seven years since we had a 
homicide 
in the fbis uniform crime report for 1988 the most recent one 
released midland tallied 1402 reported crimes half the number of 
several similarsized michigan cities 
despite all that dow contributes there are drawbacks to having 
a giant chemical company in the backyard 
a recent ranking of the nations worst toxic polluters shows dow 
ranked no 29 and third in michigan behind general motors corp and 
ford motor co 
the state first advised against eating fish from the 
tittabawassee river in 1978 after traces of the suspected 
carcinogen dioxin were found in dows discharges greenpeace 
canoeists paddled up the river in 1986 to plug dows outlets in 
protest 
in the late 1960s demonstrators came to dows doors to protest 
its manufacture of napalm jellied gasoline and defoliant agent 
orange used in the vietnam war 
the company has since worked hard to portray a greener cleaner 
image 
to cut dioxin discharges dow installed a powerful wasterecovery 
system it also cooperates with environmental groups and 
financially supports wetland preservation and recycling 
the chemical bite to the air also seems to be growing fainter 
ive lived here all my life and let me tell you you cant 
smell anything now like you could before said dean the midland 
police officer 
the city has been spared serious chemical accidents though 
reminders of what could happen occur from time to time 
chlorine gas escaped a decade ago sending emergency personnel 
scrambling last year three chemical tank cars derailed and 
burned sending billows of toxic smoke over nearby freeland where 
3000 residents were evacuated for a week 
nonetheless midland and its neighbors have also savored the 
international flavor produced by dow 
people are more involved in the world since dow has 
facilities all over the world said gordon britton editor of 
midland daily news 
world cup soccer is a nonevent in many communities said 
frank popoff dows president and chief executive officer but not 
in midland 
people here think that footballs are round with black spots on 
them you should kick them a lot and not these elongated things

the government is recovering misspent funds 
from the officers and directors of failed savings institutions and 
banks at a rate better than 1 million a day a top regulator said 
wednesday 
l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp said his agency was investigating whether to file suit 
against the officers of 1300 failed thrifts and banks and has 
already filed suit against officials of 500 institutions 
approximately 100 million was recovered last year and more than 
200 million in the first half of this year he said 
that is in excess of 1 million per day in recoveries in 
1990 he said 
president bushsson neil could be among the defendants in a 
suit he served as a director of silverado banking savings and 
loan association denver which collapsed in december 1988 at an 
estimated cost to taxpayers of 1 billion 
seidman who appeared with administration officials before the 
house judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice declined to 
comment on when a decision would be made on the silverado case 
agency officials have said they are considering a suit to recover 
losses from silverado directors 
administration officials have been increasingly hammered by 
democrats to demonstrate that they are doing enough to prosecute 
fraud and recover sampl losses the sampl problem is emerging as a hot 
issue in this years congressional races 
the recoveries are still dwarfed by the cost of bailing out the 
sampl industry estimated by the congressional general accounting 
office to be as high as 500 billion including interest on bailout 
borrowing 
in other savings and loan developments 
seidman and timothy ryan director of the office of thrift 
supervision both promised to treat neil bushs case no differently 
than any other sampl case before them in houston president bush 
repeated his promise not to interfere with regulators and said he 
has had to calm down his other sons who want to go to the 
barricades on neils behalf 
documents released by the office of thrift supervision show 
that regulators believed neil bush was unqualified and 
untrained for his position as director of silverado certainly 
he had no experience in managing a large corporation especially a 
financial institution with almost 2 billion in assets the 
documents said 
the senate approved a broad crime bill that stiffens prison 
terms for savings and loan fraud and offers rewards to 
whistleblowers for turning in sampl looters 
the former president of one of texas largest collapsed thrifts 
was indicted on fraud charges in connection with a 700 million 
real estate scheme fbi officials in dallas announced the 
indictment against edwin t mcbirney iii former president of 
sunbelt savings association 
the house judiciary panel is considering a package of reforms 
designed to speed the governments antifraud effort it would be 
attached to a house version of the broad crime bill adopted by the 
senate 
it would provide more money to hire investigators and attorneys 
to prosecute fraud prevent people convicted of fraud from evading 
restitution by filing for bankruptcy and allow regulators and 
prosecutors to seek to freeze the assets of those accused of fraud 
even before they are found guilty 
members of the panel sparred with rep peter smith rvt who 
is sponsoring a resolution calling for the appointment of a special 
prosecutor to investigate the sampl scandal 
rep john bryant dtexas called the suggestion 
mccarthyism he said the appointment of an independent 
prosecutor is appropriate only when allegations have been leveled 
at high officials who cannot be prosecuted without conflict by the 
attorney general 
smith acknowledged he had no reason to suspect anyone in 
particular but said the standard method of government prosecution 
was not working 
james g richmond the justice departments newly appointed 
special counsel for financial institutions said the department had 
no position on the resolution 
rep charles schumer dny chairman of the subcommittee 
acknowledged the sampl issue had become politicized but he said 
if the flames of partisan passions lit a fire under the 
administration to prosecute sampl thieves so be it 
said richmond we are acutely aware that the american people 
want the savings and loan wrongdoers swiftly and appropriately 
punished we do too 
seidman said fraud has been discovered in about half of the 460 
sampls seized by the government since february 1989 in 40 percent of 
the institutions fraud contributed significantly to a thrift 
failure he said 
many were owned or dominated by one individual and operated

the united states found lastminute common ground 
with its summit partners wednesday on a contentious farm subsidies 
dispute hoping to give a push to longrunning efforts to overhaul 
the world trading system 
the compromise allowed president bush to claim success on his 
top summit priority progress toward eliminating the subsidies that 
he says skew world trade as well as costing taxpayers and consumers 
billions of dollars in government spending and higher food prices 
however the european community americas chief antagonist on 
the issue claimed victory as well leaving the ultimate outcome of 
separate fouryearold international trade negotiations still very 
much in doubt 
even if the united states does persuade european governments to 
lower their farm payments bush would still have to take on 
wellentrenched farm interests to dismantle the us farm support 
program 
bush told reporters at a news conference that he was committed 
to push congress for reductions in us subsidies saying we 
have to do it it is a twoway street with other nations 
rep kika de la garza dtexas chairman of the house 
agriculture committee called the summit agreement encouraging 
but said it will not alter plans to maintain us agriculture 
subsidies as part of a fiveyear farm bill now before congress 
i hasten to point out that while the seven nations represented 
in houston play an important part in world trade any final 
agreement must be reached in geneva with the participation of all 
96 gatt signatory nations de la garza said 
if concrete agreements are reached in geneva then we will 
consider what changes may be necessary in our national agriculture 
policy he said 
administration officials saw the summit agreement as a european 
commitment to significant acrosstheboard reductions in all types 
of farm subsidies officials of the european community interpreted 
the final document as more general than that 
commenting on the disparity of views canadian prime minister 
brian mulroney said that it pointed to a long hard bargaining 
process ahead 
im not under any illusions that well be dealing with a new 
era by christmas or even by next spring he said 
but british prime minister margaret thatcher was more upbeat 
saying she believed the trade outcome would map a new route to 
prosperity 
coming after last weeks very successful nato summit which 
took a major stride towards a more peaceful world the results of 
the meeting in houston are an important step towards a more 
prosperous world for everyone mrs thatcher said 
a senior us official briefing reporters on condition that she 
not be named said that the summit communique represented 
significant progress just in getting the european community back to 
the bargaining table 
now we have a framework within which to negotiate we are 
still very far apart in many areas but we have a framework she 
said 
the united states has been pushing since the venice economic 
summit in 1987 for a commitment to halt a global farm subsidy war 
it estimates is costing 245 billion annually 
but the european community has resisted bushs demand saying it 
would result in the loss of 3 million farmers jobs 
bush officials fear that unless the farm dispute is resolved it 
will kill all chances for successfully completing ambitious global 
trade talks known as the uruguay round 
the administration is counting on those talks to lower a wide 
range of trade barriers and greatly expand opportunities for 
american farmers and businesses believing this will help americas 
100billionplus trade deficits 
the talks known as the uruguay round for the country where they 
began in 1986 face a marathon july 23 negotiating session in 
geneva to draft framework agreements in 15 separate areas 
including agriculture 
those agreements will then be used over the next five months to 
achieve a final agreement by a december deadline for ending the 
discussions 
the economic summit involved discussions among bush and the 
leaders of japan west germany france britain canada and italy 
in their final communique the leaders declared that successful 
completion of the uruguay round was the highest priority on the 
international economic agenda and stressed our determination to 
take the difficult political decisions necessary to achieve 
farreaching substantial results in all areas of the uruguay round 
by the end of this year 
bush told reporters at a news conference wrapping up the 
threeday summit that the leaders had committed at the end of the 
lengthy debate on farm subsidies to maintain our personal 
involvement and to exercise political leadership at every step 
along the way 
the final language in the communique urged each nation to make 
substantial progressive reductions in the areas of export 
subsidies internal price supports and barriers to imports the 
three areas targeted by the united states 
the europeans had opposed singling out specific areas for 
subsidy cuts offering instead to consider all subsidies in an 
aggregate total and then reduce that total 
while us negotiators contended that the compromise reached in 
houston would prohibit that the european community disagreed 
they contended the final communique committed them only to 
reducing the total amount of government subsidies marking no 
change from their original position 
the communique language was sufficiently vague on this point 
that both sides could point to it to support their stands 
bush spoke forcefully on the subject during the summit meetings 
but he faced strong resistance from european countries the leaders 
had to extend their afternoon session tuesday for an extra 90 
minutes grappling with the farm question 
they then dispatched lower level negotiators to work through the 
night to come up with the final language 
the uruguay round is being held under the auspices of the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade a forum and agreement for 
promoting freer trade

federal regulators have ordered the nations 
largest banks to write off sizable portions of loans to 
economically troubled brazil and argentina bankers said wednesday 
the order made in letters from the interagency country exposure 
review committee will require banks to write off an additional 20 
percent of 29 billion in outstanding loans to argentina and 20 
percent of 11 billion in loans to brazil 
the writedown of brazilian loans is the first required by 
federal authorities the move on argentina boosts to 60 percent the 
amount of loans that must be written off by the 36 affected us 
banks 
bank officials speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed the 
receipt of letters in recent days from the committee which 
consists of three federal bank regulators the committee normally 
does not announce its decisions 
the action could force some of the banks to further boost 
reserves to protect against losses from nonperforming loans to 
developing nations if a bank does not have enough set aside in 
reserves to cover the writedowns the new charges could depress 
earnings 
the 20 percent writeoff of argentine debt was the third ordered 
by federal authorities 
brazils was considered surprising because the country has 
undertaken economic reform under new president fernando collor de 
mello and is expected to resume negotiations this year on meeting 
some bank debt obligations 
citicorp the nations largest bank holding company declined to 
comment on the regulatory action but it said the bank already had 
written down 60 percent of its argentine exposure from a 1 billion 
reserve created last year 
any other such writedowns voluntary or mandated would 
likewise be charged to the reserve without earnings impact the 
statement said 
thats the reason for taking such provisions and reserves 
citicorp said the earnings impact occurs when they are taken 
not when a writedown subsequently occurs 
citicorp would be forced to write off 660 million of its 33 
billion exposure to brazilian loans under the new mandate 
officials said it would not have to take further writedowns 
against its current 400 million exposure to argentine loans
