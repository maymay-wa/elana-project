the animal after animal rights activists flooded a court with 
protest letters

decided to drop their claim to 19monthold champ a german 
shepherdcollie 
more than 21000 signatures were brought to the court demanding 
the family be denied custody because of photographs a neighbor took 
in november that showed deschene beating champ with a 4foot wooden 
plank 
deschene 19 was sentenced last month to a year in prison for a 
misdemeanor complaint of cruelty to animals six months of the 
conviction were suspended 
the photographs by neighbor jim molloy were widely publicized 
deschene said he was disciplining champ for tearing up garbage 
this was a very difficult time for kevin and the family 
turley said after the hearing friday they had champ for eight or 
nine months they loved that dog 
kim deschene kevins sister was arrested after fridays 
hearing for alleged witness intimidation against molloy said 
lowell police sgt steven smith 
barbara deschene kevins mother also was arrested friday on 
an unrelated charge of alleged larceny in a welfare fraud smith 
said 
allan davidson the executive director of the lowell humane 
society who has been caring for champ since nov 28 said his 
office had received more than 3700 letters from people across the 
country asking that champ not be returned to the deschene family 
even doris day sent a telegram the day before yesterday asking 
us to keep the dog away from the family and put him in a loving 
home davidson said day is an active animal rights campaigner 
the new home will provide him with the love and care he 
needs davidson said he would not disclose where the dogs new 
home saying he feared reprisals from the deschene family 
esther nowell president of protection of animals in wakefield 
society or paws was one of the many animal rights activists who 
attended the hearing 
i feel that justice has been done ms nowell saidfor the 
first time in my memory a man has gone to jail and is having to 
actually serve time for cruelty to animals then hes says he wants 
the dog back its not right 
turley said the family dropped the custody battle because they 
were afraid that when they got champ back in their home the 
circus would never end 
they want to get on with their lives turley said 
wounds on champs head and thighs have healed but the 
psychological effects will be with him for the rest of his life 
davidson said

prosecutors said the light sentence given 
a computer hacker whose worm shut down a nationwide network 
would not deter them from cracking down on computer abuse 
robert t morris jr 25 was sentenced friday to three years 
probation fined 10000 and ordered to perform 400 hours community 
service 
although the justice department had asked that morris be given 
jail time us attorney frederick scullin jr said he believed the 
sentence was fair 
this is sort of a unique circumstance he said i dont 
feel its going to be any sort of a precedent 
scullin said future computer hackers may face stricter sentences 
wouldbe hackers are now on notice that the department of 
justice will vigorously prosecute future computer criminals and 
seek severe penalties regardless of what their motives are he 
said 
us district judge howard munson said there were no previous 
cases that could be used as a model for sentencing 
in january morris became the first person to be convicted under 
the 1986 computer fraud and abuse act for breaking into a federal 
computer network and preventing authorized use of the system 
the former cornell university graduate student was found guilty 
of creating a worm program on nov 2 1988 that invaded an 
estimated 6000 computers linked to the internet research system 
used at nasa military facilities and major universities 
once in the system the program replicated itself wildly 
paralyzing the network 
under federal sentencing guidelines morris faced up to five 
years in prison and a 250000 fine but his attorneys argued that 
the case did not fit the guidelines 
this is not your gardenvariety fraud crime attorney david 
obrien said this crime was not motivated by malice it was not 
motivated by an intention to do harm it was an experiment albeit 
a reckless irresponsible stupid one 
defense attorney thomas guidoboni said the sentence was 
reasonable but he will file an appeal to challenge the law under 
which morris was convicted 
i dont believe mr morris deserves to be a felon for what he 
did guidoboni said 
morris did not speak at the sentencing and did not talk to 
reporters afterward when the sentence was announced he smiled and 
hugged his mother 
robert morris sr a scientist at the national computer security 
center in bethesda md said he does not consider his son a 
criminal 
there is real computer crime in this country he said it 
is rampant and extremely expensive and this case did not begin to 
touch on that 
morris who was suspended from cornell after the worm incident 
works at a computerrelated job in cambridge mass 
he testified at his trial that the worm was an experiment that 
went out of control because of a programming error he made he 
admitted he designed the worm to attack the internet system but 
said it wasnt supposed to replicate as it did 
prosecutors described his program as a fullscale assault 
and said morris took deliberate steps to make the worm difficult to 
trace and eradicate

lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene 
says a strong declaration of support by western nations could be 
decisive in bringing the baltic republics independence from the 
soviet union 
mrs prunskienes twoday nonstop crusade for lithuanian 
independence at the white house state department and on capitol 
hill resulted in an inconclusive session with president bush 
but she said friday that she continues to hope that bush and 
other world leaders can yet be persuaded that embracing 
independence for lithuania and its neighbors latvia and estonia 
will not undermine soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and his 
program of political and economic reform 
she said the reluctance of western nations to recognize an 
independent lithuania now is the main factor in the soviets 
refusal to accept her republics secession as an accomplished fact 
mrs prunskiene will meet with british prime minister margaret 
thatcher in london on tuesday and is expected to use the occasion 
to appeal once more for western guarantees of lithuanian 
sovereignty 
such guarantees are essential she said for lithuanian 
participation in any compromise calling for the temporary 
suspension of independence laws 
mrs prunskienes last scheduled appearance in the united states 
was an address today to the lithuanian youth association here 
speaking on friday at the national press club the lithuanian 
leader said the summit between bush and gorbachev opening here on 
may 30 offers a crucial opportunity to cement baltic independence 
that would end a chapter begun 50 years ago when the soviet 
union forcibly annexed lithuania latvia and estonia after striking 
a secret deal with nazi germanys adolf hitler 
but mrs prunskiene said the united states and the west must act 
more decisively than they have to date if that is to become a 
reality 
she said western guarantees are needed because merely urging 
goodfaith negotiations with moscow is no answer to her republics 
insistence on eventual true independence 
simply making statements that there should be cooperation is 
not adequate at this time when the soviets are interfering in 
lithuanias ties with other countries mrs prunskiene said 
she appealed to bush to withhold the preferred trade and tariff 
status the soviets have eagerly sought as an opening to the worlds 
markets 
granting most favored nation preferences while the soviets 
are tightening their economic blockade of lithuania would be 
providing implicit support for their actions she said 
but in a policy shift mrs prunskiene dropped demands for the 
immediate imposition of retaliatory us economic sanctions against 
the kremlin possibly out of concern that step might anger 
lithuanias supporters among the soviet unions emerging 
prodemocracy forces 
we would hope the imposition of economic sanctions would be 
held in reserve as a threat to our eventually sitting down at the 
negotiating table because we are not looking for a situation where 
the soviet people are forced to suffer she said

president bush says that even as he 
slashes new missile systems and negotiates with the soviets to 
reduce others nuclear weapons are still needed in europe 
only the combination of conventional forces and nuclear forces 
have insured peace in europe he said friday in the first of a 
series of commencement speeches he will make on the changing 
geopolitical face of the world 
bush said that in addition to scrapping upgraded lance missiles 
in europe he wants to begin talks with the soviets to reduce other 
shortrange missiles shortly after signing a treaty on reducing 
conventional forces next fall 
nonetheless he said the united states is not going to allow 
europe to become safe for conventional war 
thus the nuclear component must remain to protect europe in 
concert with conventional elements such as troops and tanks he 
said 
a senior administration official briefing reporters on air 
force one under condition of anonymity said we think there 
needs to be some nuclear weapons in europe deterrence has to have 
a nuclear component 
bush said the 16 north atlantic treaty organization countries 
meeting in late june or early july should outline the minimum 
number and types of weapons that will be needed to deter war 
credibly and effectively 
he said militarily significant us forces would remain in 
europe where some 300000 now are stationed 
in the address at oklahoma state university the president 
elaborated on his call for the nato summit to completely review the 
alliances mission both military and political in light of the 
dramatic democratic reforms in the warsaw pact countries 
bush later flew to tulsa and spoke to the oklahoma foundation 
for excellence which honored 100 outstanding high school seniors 
he also attended a republican fundraising reception 
the presidents recent acknowledgment that he hates broccoli was 
well noted on the oklahoma stop 
at the airport a child held a large handdrawn poster of bush 
in a boxing ring standing triumphantly over a felled broccoli 
opponent bush beats broccoli the poster said the president 
autographed it for the child 
later he joked that someone in the graduation crowd had a sign 
reading george eat your broccoli 
i dont need advice from little kids on what i eat he 
exclaimed 
bush flew friday night to camp david md and returns to the 
white house on sunday for budget talks with congressional leaders 
the meeting comes after a week that saw the senate budget 
committee and the house adopt separate democraticwritten budgets 
for next year each one strips nearly 10 billion from bushs own 
military spending proposal for fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 
the budget itself does not require bushs signature but he must 
sign separate bills that finance programs or raise and lower taxes 
administration officials and republican lawmakers have been 
pressing all year for budget negotiations

the skipper of the uss iowa fired a 
departing salvo at the navy saying it had mishandled a probe into 
the gun turret explosion that killed 47 sailors aboard his ship 
last year 
facing the guns of the battleship where the sailors died on 
april 19 1989 capt fred p moosally said at his retirement 
ceremony friday the men who handled the report were more interested 
in the navys image than the good of the crew 
moosally said the investigation was handled by people who used 
facts and opinions based on unsubstantiated thirdparty 
information unsubstantiated reports and supposition 
the navys investigation concluded sabotage by gunners mate 
clayton hartwig caused the blast it said hartwig who died in the 
blast was disgruntled and suicidal about how the navy had treated 
him for promotion and assignments 
people who in their rush to manage the iowa problem forgot 
about doing the right thing for the iowa crew said moosally a 
24year veteran 
the explosion was a dual tragedy fortyseven men died and 
1500 survivors were made victims when they should have been 
heros moosally said 
moosally had previously been tightlipped about the sixmonth 
navy investigation of the explosion that sent a deadly fireball 
running inside turret no 2 at the end of the ceremony he was 
awarded the legion of merit for leadership aboard the iowa 
following the explosion 
moosallys word were soothing to some of the relatives of the 
dead sailors 
ive been waiting for this day because i was hoping and 
praying that the man will really speak his mind about the 
accident kathy kubicina hartwigs sister said in a telephone 
interview from her home in cleveland ohio 
ms kubicina and other families have been fighting to get the 
navy to reopen its investigation two congressional inquiries have 
reviewed the report which several members of congress have said is 
flawed 
this is just great news for the captain of the ship to say it 
was inadequate that really tells a lot said ms kubicina 
a navy spokesman in washington lt mark walker said moosallys 
criticism of the investigation was his personal opinion the 
investigating officer rear adm richard milligan and his team 
were extremely thorough and professional throughout the 
investigation 
walker said milligans conclusions were reached after an 
intense methodical investigation during which the navy conducted 
more than 20000 technical tests that ruled out possible accidental 
causes 
john hague whose stepson philip buch died in the explosion 
has defended the navys report in the past but he agreed with 
moosally the iowa crew had been slighted 
there is no doubt in my mind that those men are heroes he 
said from his home in la mesa nm 
nancy lewis of northville mich whose son richard was killed 
in the explosion said moosally has joined the ranks of many of 
the rest of us on how the report was handled maybe the navy is 
trying to do the right thing 
moosally a 1966 graduate of the us naval academy was 
succeeded by his executive officer cmdr john p morse the 
battleship is expected to be decommissioned and put in mothballs 
later this year

president bushs appointment of an emergency 
board to help resolve a labor dispute over rising health care costs 
in the railroad industry is winning praise from labor leaders 
the board is needed to head off a crippling nationwide rail 
strike the white house said friday in naming a panel to help 
settle bargaining disputes between 11 unions and the nations major 
railroads 
negotiators have been trying to reach a contract for two years 
but rising health care costs for 300000 workers remain an obstacle 
a few months ago labor secretary elizabeth dole appointed a 
commission to study health care costs within the coal industry a 
key issue in last years bitter pittston strike 
dick kilroy chairman of the cooperating railway labor 
organizations which represents the 11 unions said health care 
costs in the railroad industry have been rising between 15 percent 
and 20 percent a year and were expected to continue on that path 
for another five years 
its an issue that really doesnt belong on the bargaining 
table kilroy said 
rex hardesty a spokesman for the aflcio called bushs action 
very encouraging because with pittston it was the second 
recognition of the overwhelming problem 
both sides in the dispute had expected the white house to 
appoint the board an action that in effect provides a 60day 
coolingoff period before any strike can occur 
bush was criticized by labor leaders last year when he declined 
to appoint an emergency board in the strike by machinists at 
eastern airlines that was the first time to the national 
mediation boards knowledge that a president had not acted once 
the board notified him of a potential emergency within the 
transportation industry 
bush created the threemember railroad board under authority 
given him by the railway labor act 
under that law labor contracts stay in force during 
negotiations essentially postponing their expiration indefinitely 
if the two sides reach an impasse in their talks other provisions 
of the law trigger various forms of government intervention leading 
up to the creation of an emergency board if the president decides 
to appoint one 
administration officials said the railroad impasse differs from 
the airline strike both sides in the railroad dispute were seeking 
white house help they said but texas air corp easterns parent 
company did not want an emergency board named in that dispute 
in addition the eastern walkout has disrupted only a portion of 
the airline industry while a railroad strike would affect the 
entire nation 
a white house statement said the railroad dispute threatens 
substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree such as 
to deprive various sections of the country of essential 
transportation service 
the department of transportation has advised that the 
railroads move over onethird of all intercity freight traffic 
which involves goods valued at more than 1 billion each day the 
statement said 
a rail strike besides idling railroad workers and stranding 
riders could cause more than 500000 layoffs within two weeks in 
industries served by railroads the white house said 
the direct costs of a strike could be at least 16 million per 
day and the indirect economic costs could be much higher it 
said 
the members of the emergency board are robert o harris of 
washington ombudsman for the international monetary fund who will 
serve as chairman and labor arbitrators richard r kasher of bryn 
mawr pa and arthur stark of new york

the united states and its major trading 
partners are proclaiming progress in an ambitious effort to 
overhaul the global trading system while also conceding that 
serious obstacles remain 
us trade representative carla hills and her counterparts from 
japan the 12nation european community and canada said friday that 
they had been able to better define the differences that exist 
between them during three days of talks at a posh resort in 
california wine country 
japanese trade minister kabun muto called the discussions 
frank and useful canadian trade minister john crosbie said he 
believed they had been successful in turning the heat up to 
provide momentum toward an agreement 
but the officials conceded there had been no major breakthroughs 
in the discussions and that such contentious issues as agricultural 
subsidies and barriers to trade in textiles remained far from 
settled 
global trade talks being conducted through the 97nation 
general agreement on tariffs and trade or gatt were launched at a 
conference in uruguay in 1986 and are scheduled to conclude this 
december 
the bush administration is counting on a successful outcome to 
boost sales by american businesses and farmers and thus lower the 
huge us trade deficit 
specifically it is seeking agreement to phase out within 10 
years costly farm subsidies to broaden gatt rules to include 
service industries such as banking and insurance and to strengthen 
protection against copyright piracy which costs american companies 
60 billion annually 
but the european community seeking to protect its network of 
small farms is fighting the effort to slash farm subsidies while 
third world nations oppose lowering barriers for service 
industries contending that they need to protect fledgling domestic 
businesses 
hills said she was still hopeful that the differences can be 
resolved she said she expected an outline of a final agreement to 
be completed during a negotiating session in late july 
with time running out on the fouryear effort to reform the 
global trading system hills said the negotiators would appeal to 
president bush and other leaders at the july summit of seven 
industrialized nations to supply a political push to break the 
stalemates 
still without a decision by some countries to compromise the 
final outcome of the freetrade talks was uncertain 
one us official speaking on condition of anonymity said it 
was likely the toughest issues would not be resolved until the 
final bargaining session seven months from now in brussels 
negotiations are a process of attrition he said it is 
just in the nature of things with issues that are hardfought 
frans andriessen trade minister for the european community 
said the wealthy nations needed to try harder to make the trade 
package attractive to developing countries to ensure their support 
in the final round of bargaining 
if an agreement is reached the administration must still 
persuade congress to accept the document 
already us special interests from textile manufacturers to 
sugar and peanut growers are lining up congressional supporters to 
oppose any trade agreement that results in a loss of trade 
protections they now enjoy

the seized assets of manuel noriega include some of 
11 million he got from us intelligence agencies his lawyers 
argued while asking that the government be forced to release the 
money so they can be paid 
a federal judge friday ordered the government to justify its 
seizure of the deposed panamanian leaders 20 million in assets 
which defense attorneys claim were earned legitimately 
noriegas lawyers argued during an hourlong hearing that they 
cannot proceed without money from bank accounts frozen by the 
government they subpoenaed records from the cia drug enforcement 
administration and other agencies as a way to prove noriegas 
income was not from drug trafficking 
frank rubino noriegas lead attorney told us district judge 
william hoeveler that us intelligence agencies had paid noriega 
11 million during his years in the panamanian national guard 
i dont know if you can call money from the cia tainted or 
not but its certainly not drug money rubino said 
noriega was paid another 6 million or 7 million by foreign 
governments the defense claimed at the hearing which was not 
attended by noriega 
noriega was indicted in miami in february 1988 on charges of 
taking money from colombias medellin drug cartel to make panama a 
safe haven for cocaine smuggling he surrendered to us 
authorities jan 4 two weeks after us troops invaded panama 
the judge appeared sympathetic to the defenses position that 
the seizure of assets was unreasonable 
it appears he must have acquired some assets of his own in his 
20 years as an officer hoeveler said 
the judge ordered the us attorneys office to come up with a 
list of noriegas seized assets and justify their confiscation he 
also indicated he expected them to cooperate fully with the defense 
subpoenas which were served thursday 
hoeveler said while noriega clearly could not use illgotten 
gains to pay his attorneys the government could not arbitrarily 
seize money without proving he had earned it through drug 
trafficking or other illegal means 
rubino said at the hearing that 58 million confiscated by us 
troops in noriegas quarters in panama was given back to the 
panamanian government by the united states without informing 
noriegas lawyers he said the government never established whether 
that money was acquired illegally 
assistant us attorney michael sullivan said the government did 
not object to making a list of the bank accounts but he said all 
the accounts except one were in foreign banks 
foreign governments will have some interest in the money and 
their laws will prevail over those assets sullivan said 
in court papers rubino said the government already has spent 
12 million and was prepared to spend 25 million more prosecuting 
noriega rubino said the defense has the right to use noriegas 
funds to hire more attorneys investigators and secretaries 
sullivan responded with an affidavit from another prosecutor who 
said rubino told her he had received a retainer of seven 
figures from noriega rubino has acknowledged the comment but 
said it was a joke 
rubino said attorneys learned the intelligence community is in 
possession of evidence that completely exonerates general noriega 
as to a particular count of the indictment but said the defense 
lacks the money to pursue the lead 
the prosecution says the money at issue is held in 27 bank 
accounts 
only one of these accounts located in panama is in the 
defendants name a government motion said adding investigators 
are not even sure if it contains any money 
noriega is being held at the federal metropolitan correctional 
center outside miami

cigarette opponents want the us government 
to end policies that they say help tobacco companies increase their 
sales in asia to offset declines in the united states 
the united states was long admired for its lifesaving medical 
advances but now because of the aggressive advertising of the 
tobacco industry we are acquiring a different reputation in the 
third world as exporters of disease and death sen edward m 
kennedy dmass told his labor and human resources committee on 
friday 
kennedy charged that the us government has been an 
accomplice threatening trade sanctions against countries which 
restrict access to american cigarettes 
the senators comments were the latest round in an escalating 
conflict between the tobacco industry and critics who want to halt 
government efforts to expand the foreign market for us brand 
cigarettes in the name of free trade 
free trade is not a license to export lung cancer or ride 
roughshod over the antismoking laws of other nations kennedy 
said 
walter d huddleston a witness for the us cigarette export 
association countered that the issue is not health but trade and 
jobs for american tobacco growers and workers 
the same number of cigarettes are going to be smoked in 
foreign countries regardless of whether american products are there 
or not he said the only issue is who makes them who grows 
the tobacco we are not exporting the practice of smoking 
but william foege former director of the centers for disease 
control testified that when us manufacturers enter a market in 
a developing country they not only bring cigarettes they bring 
marketing and advertising techniques far superior to those 
existing 
smoking is declining about 1 percent a year in advanced 
countries but rising at least 2 percent in the third world foege 
said he predicted that it would become the leading cause of death 
in developing countries by the end of the decade killing more 
people annually than the 6 million believed slaughtered during the 
entire holocaust 
the governments success in opening markets to us cigarette 
brands in japan south korea and taiwan and a current effort in 
thailand drew praise from witnesses representing the industry and 
tobaccogrowing states and in a letter from 120 house members 
delivered earlier this week to us trade representative carla 
hills 
dr gregory connolly testifying for the american cancer society 
and heart and lung associations said cigarette consumption was 
declining in japan until the market was opened to american 
countries it then rose 3 percent while the increase in taiwan was 
4 percent he said 
in 1987 cigarettes rose from 40th to second place in total 
japanese television advertising time heavily targeting women and 
youths connolly said 
describing tobacco exports as a success story industry 
witnesses said tobacco was one of the few us exports earning a 
surplus last year more than 42 billion to help offset the 109 
billion trade deficit 
rep chester atkins dmass said hearings will be held later 
this month on house legislation to bar the us trade 
representative from intervening on behalf of tobacco exports the 
bill also would require us tobacco brands sold abroad to carry 
the same health warnings as in the united states

newports bellevue avenue known as millionaires row has at 
least three homes for sale and more than a dozen condominiums 
other castlelike homes are listed in some of the less visible but 
perhaps more opulent neighborhoods of this highsociety city that 
once hosted the americas cup and is home to the tennis hall of 
fame 
jacqueline cranwell of gustave js white real estate an 
affiliate of sothebys international realty said there is nothing 
unusual about the number of newport spreads listed 
all the houses we have on the market are on for various 
reasons nothing to do with money problems cranwell said its 
just the normal turnover 
the people who own dwellings of this sort arent the kind 
affected by seasonal turns of the economy she said 
if you have money you have it cranwell said 
but there is some evidence to the contrary 
a fourbedroom brick carriage house on 1 acres was listed for 
seven months at 28 million and sold only after the price was 
lowered to 13 million cranwell said 
and some who may be able to purchase estates only with financing 
may not qualify in slower economic times corbin said 
the rhode island association of realtors said the northeast has 
been the hardest hit area in a nationwide slump in the first 
quarter rhode island home sales declined 85 percent from the same 
period last year 
in newport the median price for a singlefamily home dropped to 
140000 compared to 159000 a year ago 
if youve got the money the choices are impressive 
bellevue avenues vernon court built in 1900 to resemble a 
french chateau is one of newports grandest homes the asking

a 52footlong entrance hall leads to the 15000squarefoot 
residence with six bedrooms for the hosts and 10 for the servants 
although the 3acre estate is not on the waterfront it has a 
heated 25footby50foot swimming pool larger than most living 
rooms 
within a 10foothigh wall surrounding the yard are two tennis 
courts and a garden copied from the ones henry viii built for ann 
boylen at hampton court cranwell said 
also up for sale is lands end on ledge road it was built around 
1870 and american novelist edith wharton bought the home about 20 
years later 
wharton renovated the home with architect ogden codman with 
whom she wrote the book on the decoration of houses one of 
the first on interior design corbin said 
the stucco waterfront home has 10 bedrooms 5 acres of land 
and is very typically ogden codman who was a colonial 
revivalist he said its listed for 27 million 
if your tastes run to gardens and you have 425 million 
wildacre on ocean drive might be for you its japanese gardens were 
designed by frederick law olmsted who laid out new york citys

its listed at 20 million 
the 10000squarefoot home is set on a 40acre peninsula with 
more than 7000 feet of water frontage and a private dock for 20

the head of the strategic air command says b2 
stealth bomber pilots may fly the radarevading aircraft only twice 
a month to hold down expenses 
i realize how expensive this plane is we plan to fly it 
twice a month under special circumstances gen john t chain jr 
told reporters 
budget pressures were the primary impetus behind defense 
secretary dick cheneys recent decision to buy only 75 of the 
batwinged aircraft instead of the 132 planned chain said 
if werent for the budget driving the numbers 132 would 
never have come down chain said 
the general oversees the nations force of nuclear bombers 
intercontinental ballistic missiles tankers and reconnaissance 
aircraft at sac in omaha neb 
cheney named budget pressures and the changed situation in the 
soviet union and eastern europe in presenting his reassessment of 
the needs for the futuristic strategic bomber last week to congress 
buying fewer planes will drive up the cost of each bomber 
the bombers would cost 530 million apiece if 132 are purchased 
if only 75 are bought they would cost 815 million each making 
them the costliest aircraft ever produced 
congressional opposition to the aircraft has grown as lawmakers 
scramble to glean a peace dividend from the pentagon budget 
chain who has been an ardent advocate on behalf of the 
132bomber request said he could support the revised figure 
because of the changes that have brought democratic governments to 
nations in eastern europe 
one hundred thirtytwo was justified in the world in which it 
was created seventyfive is an adequate number an adequate 
number of warheads for the task we have in the future he said 
the fourstar general said he believes if the world turns 
ugly several years from now the president could order the number 
of bombers increased its not a finite number he said 
but chain said he couldnt support a purchase of fewer than 75 
planes

west german officials are dangling the 
prospect of more economic ties in front of the soviets in an effort 
to soften their adamant rejection of a united germany as a nato 
member 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher in an interview friday 
with the west berlin radio station rias said there could be 
versatile economic relations that would not be disadvantageous to 
the soviets union after german unification 
however asked if a united germany can be in nato soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze responded friday shortly after 
his arrival in west germany with a firm no 
for such a giant to belong to one bloc one alliance will 
not create conditions for stability he said 
the soviets have called for a neutral germany 
shevardnadze also met friday for about 90 minutes with 
chancellor helmut kohl 
the west germans made clear they were willing to offer something 
in exchange for a shift in the kremlins position on the military 
posture of a united germany 
kohl spokesman hans klein said the chancellor offered 
shevardnadze a significant expansion of bilateral ties 
particularly economic cooperation 
west germany is already one of the soviet unions biggest 
trading partners and has indicated a willingness to guarantee east 
german exports to the soviet union the latest offer seemed to 
signal bonns readiness to expand trade and investments although 
klein did not offer specifics 
the soviet union has said repeatedly that it opposes allowing a 
united germany to join the north atlantic treaty organization 
nato foreign ministers meeting in brussels belgium on 
thursday said they remain in favor of a single german state 
belonging to the western alliance 
but they also offered several compromise gestures to the 
soviets saying that a united germany should not have any chemical 
or nuclear weapons and that soviet troops could remain in what is 
now east germany for several years 
the question of security arrangements are a major obstacle at 
talks beginning today in bonn among the two germanys and the four 
world war ii allies

television interview aired friday night

administration while the democratic opposition is the weakest in

a rift has developed in east germanys first 
noncommunist government with a major partner in the fragile 
coalition accusing leaders of letting west germany dictate the 
terms for reunification 
in the east berlin cabinet stands a crack in the house 
because we up to now cannot be held responsible for the outcome of 
the unification state treaty richard schroeder head of the 
social democrat faction in parliament said friday 
i am worried about a break in the axle on the way to unity 
he said 
experts from both germanys met in east berlin on friday for 
ongoing talks on shifting east germany away from a socialist 
economy as quickly as possible 
the leftleaning social democrats hold important cabinet posts 
in the government of prime minister lothar de maiziere but they 
have begun distancing themselves from agreements on merging the two 
economies 
their latest criticism could put the shaky coalition government 
in jeopardy 
although the social democrats agreed to join the government of 
de maiziere who leads the conservative christian democrats they 
complained friday that the terms of the economic union would create 
hardships for east germans 
social minister regine hildebrandt a social democrat 
criticized the decision between the governments to tailor east 
germanys pension program to west germanys she said it would 
reduce benefits for east germans 
the economies and social institutions of the two nations are to 
merge on july 2 as a prelude to full unification next year 
but social democrats have become increasingly critical of what 
they say is a willingness to accept bonns terms and the lack of 
guarantees to protect east germans who will give up enormous social 
subsidies 
de maiziere whose party finished first in the march 18 
elections formed a coalition with the social democrats to have the 
twothird parliament majority needed to make constitutional changes 
that would make unification possible 
on sunday east germans will vote in local elections they are 
expected to remove the last traces of communist control and put the 
finishing touches on the social revolution that began a year ago 
the balloting will turn over to local hands the obedient 
bureaucracies that were carefully controlled by the former 
hardline leadership 
the balloting also may provide a gauge of the current mood 
toward german unification a process that is speeding toward 
completion talks among the two germanys and four world war ii 
allies were being held today in bonn west germany 
more than 12 million voters in 7800 cities districts and other 
municipalities are eligible to vote in the elections sixtytwo 
parties and more than a quartermillion candidates are registered 
to run 
the elections come against a backdrop of widespread protests in 
recent weeks by east german workers afraid that their factories 
will close when forced to compete with western commerce 
however west germany says a quick move to a free market will 
create jobs raise living standards and eventually eliminate the 
economic hardships of the early stages of unification 
the two governments agreed on the general terms of an economic 
union on wednesday it would exchange salaries wages and small 
savings accounts of east germans for an equal amount of west german 
marks 
wolfgang tierse deputy chief of the social democrats faction 
said his party would not endorse the economic and social treaty 
that is being negotiated as a basis for unification he said it 
would bring massive poverty

because their sentences were less than 15 years in prison ladner 
was taken into custody 
the 12member jury had convicted the three men of murder on 
thursday 
corrine garner widow of the victim said im glad im happy 
that they were convicted and they got time they should have 
gotten life

satisfied the three men would pay for his sons death 
hes been missed you know i was so used to him he said 
the three former lawmen were acquitted of civil rights charges 
in garners death in 1988 and their lawyers plan to appeal on 
grounds the murder trial constituted double jeopardy

authorities closed off 
this violencetorn reservation again after allowing outsiders to 
attend the funeral of a mohawk indian killed in a violent feud over 
casino gambling 
the reservation which straddles the border with canada in 
northern new york was opened friday to journalists and outsiders 
as the mohawks buried matthew pyke the first of two indians slain 
in the conflict 
but state police sealed off all roads shortly before nightfall 
new york and canadian police have been stationed here since tuesday 
to keep the peace 
things are still touchy state trooper ronald clark said 
we want to try to keep things stable here to allow the 
negotiations to begin 
a specially assembled mediation team dispatched by the us 
justice department was arriving today to buttress the efforts of 
one federal mediator already on the scene said grace flores 
hughes director of the departments community relations service in 
washington 
in ottawa canadian indian affairs minister tom siddon said the 
canadian and us governments would help mohawk leaders find a 
lasting solution to peace 
we have to keep in mind that governments must not impose 
solutions that are not welcome he said so theres no magic 
formula for governments to pull out of a bag somewhere and say 
heres the answer to your problems 
siddon said a liaison committee will now look at longerterm 
solutions including economic alternatives to gambling but first 
he said a dialogue had to be restored between all parties on the 
reservation 
new york gov mario cuomo said he would press for creation of an 
independent mohawk police force on the reservation 
outsiders have been barred from entering the 28000acre 
reservation since the 22yearold pyke and harold edwards jr 32 
were shot to death during a protracted gun battle early tuesday 
pyke was a gambling opponent edwards was on the progambling side 
the reservation home to about 9000 mohawks has been torn by 
sporadic violence since last july when the fbi and state police 
raided casinos on the american side gambling opponents say the 
casinos breed crime supporters say they are an economic boon for 
the reservation 
the warring factions laid aside their differences friday to 
honor pyke who was buried at a cemetery a few blocks from his 
familys home 
forty mohawks wearing clan beads embroidered shirts and other 
traditional indian dress led a funeral procession of about 500

a selfavowed cia contract agent was found 
innocent of lying about an alleged meeting at which officials in 
the reaganbush campaign asked iran to delay the release of us 
hostages until after the 1980 election 
richard j brenneke a controversial figure who also has been at 
the center of irancontra investigations was found innocent of 
five counts of false declaration for statements made before a 
federal judge in denver in 1988 
at the time brenneke was appearing as a character witness for 
denver gold dealer heinrich rupp whom brenneke said he met in 1957 
when they worked together in southeast asia for a cia proprietary 
air america 
rupp was convicted of bank fraud and is serving a 41year prison 
term 
brenneke told the denver court that he and rupp in october 1980 
helped arrange clandestine meetings involving the hostage crisis 
and that rupp flew george bush then a candidate for vice 
president to paris for the meetings 
brenneke told of three hostage meetings at two paris hotels but 
he testified thursday that he did not actually see bush in paris 
brennekes trial originally was to have been held in denver but 
was moved to portland near brennekes home after he had open 
heart surgery the trial started april 24 but was interrupted when 
brenneke was hospitalized with chest pains 
prosecutors described brenneke as a rejected cia applicant who 
operated on the fringes trying to become a broker of arms and 
intelligence and lying about his exploits but the 12member jury 
after deliberating for five hours said it believed brennekes 
story 
defense lawyer michael scott said the verdict did not mean that 
witnesses in the case such as donald p gregg the us ambassador 
to south korea had lied nor does it mean that bush was in paris 
for the alleged meetings scott said 
the verdict means that the jury did not find my client 
guilty scott said 
outside the courtroom a smiling brenneke said we told the 
truth we told the truth all along and by god it was believed 
in washington dc stephen hart deputy white house press 
secretary declined any comment on the case 
brenneke has claimed in numerous media interviews to have 
detailed knowledge about aspects of the irancontra arms scandal 
in 1988 he testified at hearings organized by sen john f 
kerry dmass that he had flown drugs from colombia to texas in 
1985 as part of a supply operation for the contras he said that 
gregg then bushs national security adviser knew of the flights 
brenneke also claimed to have bought arms for the contras in 
czechoslovakia 
thenvice president bush called bennekes claims slanderous 
in april 1989 kerrys narcotics and international relations 
subcommittee declared brenneke an unreliable witness 
brenneke in his mid40s has run an offshore investment fund 
worked as a computer programmer and as a dealer in the 
international arms market the cia denies he ever worked for the 
agency 
in his closing arguments friday assistant us attorney thomas 
m orourke dismissed as a fabrication brennekes description of 
the secret paris meeting and its purpose to sabotage president 
carters reelection campaign by delaying the hostage release 
brenneke said the meetings were attended by the late cia 
director william casey then chairman of the reagan campaign and 
gregg then a cia agent assigned to carters national security 
council staff 
gregg testified last week that he was not in paris when brenneke 
said the talks took place he produced snapshots from a family 
vacation at the delaware seashore 
on wednesday a local meteorologist testified that he had 
consulted 1980 weather maps and found greggs photographs could not 
have been taken when he said they were shot 
former national security adviser richard v allen who testified 
as a defense witness said the 1980 campaign was concerned about an 
october surprise from carter that would tilt the campaign away 
from reagan 
allen said the campaign had learned from an inside source who 
was later identified to him as secretary of state edmund muskie 
that carter was close to getting the hostages released that october 
allen said he did not attend any meeting in paris 
the 52 american hostages seized nov 4 1979 at the us 
embassy in tehran were released jan 20 1981 the day president 
reagan was sworn in

francois mitterrand begins his 10th year as 
frances president next week with his popularity plummeting and his 
political integrity under harsh attack in a new bestselling 
biography 
some political analysts predict mitterrands problems will 
worsen in the coming months others suggest the socialist president 
will bounce back as he has many times in an upanddown 45year 
political career 
recent public opinion polls show a dramatic drop in popularity 
for the 73yearold president 
a sofres survey recorded a 12point fall from 61 to 53 percent 
in a single month while a poll by the journal du dimanche 
newspaper found only 39 percent of respondents satisfied with 
mitterrands performance 
dont ever forget francois mitterrand is an artist of 
resurrection says franzolivier geisbert author of the new 
unflattering biography in 1980 he was finished in 1981 he was 
elected president of the republic 
geisbert 41 a prominent journalist who has worked for both 
leftist and conservative publications has been following 
mitterrands career for many years 
his second book on mitterrand the president is filled with 
revealing anecdotes and interviews and conversations with 
presidential advisors ministers opposition leaders reporters 
and mitterrand himself 
currently on the bestseller list it strips away mitterrands 
image as a lofty highprincipled statesman and depicts him instead 
as a ruthless scheming politician who squeezed aside principle 
and ideology to carve out his place in history 
the whole mitterrand is there in this mix of electoral 
cynicism and artistic haze he does not let himself be burdened by 
scruples when power is at stake he wrote 
the book is a devastating behindthescenes look at how 
mitterrand exercises presidential power by manipulating political 
allies and enemies 
it chronicles his intense dislike of his longtime socialist 
rival michel rocard whom he relegated to minor cabinet posts 
until attrition among his stalwarts forced him to name rocard as 
prime minister after mitterrands reelection in 1988 to a second 
sevenyear term 
the book also describes how mitterrand cleverly engineered a 
leftist coalition to beat valery giscard destaing in 1981 the 
maneuver was doubly useful to mitterrand it led ultimately to 
the decline of the communist party and fueled the rise of the 
extremeright national front party which has discredited and 
divided conservative political factions ever since 
mitterrands troubles have been making headlines for weeks 
political analysts attribute them to several events including the 
amnesty of a former socialist minister involved in a political 
fundraising scandal 
after the socialist party congress in april turned into a mean 
dogfight among contenders to the presidency not vacant until 
1995 mitterrand descended into the arena and gave a rare 
television interview trying to explain the mess his efforts 
appeared to make matters worse 
analysts say mitterrands drop in popularity can be explained by 
his loss of favor among voters with political sympathies on the 
right many of these voters backed mitterrand in 1988 viewing him 
a reassuring father figure comparable to charles de gaulle who 
would work for the broad national interest 
the key to his reelection was his ability to preserve 
influence beyond the political and sociological boundaries of the 
left noted eric dupin in liberation 
this loss of rightleaning voters has not been countered by an 
increase of support from the left such as young people and 
bluecollar workers 
mitterrand is looking for the choke to get going again 
headlined liberation a leftist daily the elysee palace seems 
to have run out of inspiration and enthusiasm

a longawaited memorial symbolizes the desire to record what 
happened at kent state university 20 years ago but the woman whose 
photographic image became an enduring symbol of that era would 
rather forget 
the photograph portrayed an anguished mary ann veccio then 14 
kneeling beside the lifeless body of one of four students slain by 
the national guard on may 4 1970 
the photograph won a pulitzer prize for john filo a student 
photographer now deputy picture editor at sports illustrated 
magazine it has become a classic recording of the violent shock of 
the vietnam war and its repercussions at home 
but the photograph hounded vecchio into seeking seclusion 
it really destroyed my life and i dont want to talk about 
it the 34yearold casino worker in las vegas told the orlando 
sentinel this week 
she wasnt interested in discussing the memorial dedicated 
friday on the kent state campus to the four slain and nine injured 
students in the antiwar demonstration 
big deal it has nothing to do with my life vecchio said 
her image cant be shaken loose from memories of that sunny 
afternoon her arms raised her faced in a grimace kneeling over 
the bleeding body of jeffrey miller who had been shot in the mouth 
after lobbing a teargas canister back at the approaching guard 
students were protesting president nixons bombing of cambodia 
and the continuation of the vietnam war 
vecchio was a runaway from the miami area at the time and she 
believes her later runins with the law were due to what the photo 
came to symbolize 
thenflorida gov claude kirk said she was planted there by 
the communists and people wrote letters that she was responsible 
for murdering all those children vecchios mother 63yearold 
claire said from the house in opalocka fla where she raised 
mary ann and five other children 
can you imagine a 14yearold girl having to deal with that 
vecchios father frank a maintenance worker for the dade 
county port authority before he died recognized his daughters 
face in the photo he traced her to indianapolis and had her 
returned home 
later vecchio was sent to a juvenile home and she was arrested 
for petty crimes such as loitering and marijuana possession the 
press hounded her she said 
ive been miserable since kent state she said five years 
after the shootings not for any political reasons but after all 
the publicity ive received i feel the police have been 
unnecessarily harassing me 
vecchio soon tired of the annual remembrances and refused to 
take part 
she married a plumber from kentucky in las vegas 11 years ago 
and they live in a quiet elmshaded mobilehome park filled with 
retirees 
vecchio returned to school for her high school diploma and has 
worked her way to a management position at a casino supervising an 
army of cashiers 
others whose lives were tied to the kent state killings hoped to 
ease their pain at the memorial dedication friday 
we hope to promote an atmosphere of reconciliation said 
florence schroeder whose son bill was another of the students 
killed told about 4000 people gathered for an hourlong ceremony 
former us sen george mcgovern said the 200000 memorial 
should encourage reconciliation between the united states and 
vietnam which do not have diplomatic relations 
the war in vietnam is unfinished said mcgovern the 
democratic presidential candidate in 1972 the killing has 
stopped but the arrogance that produced it survives and so does 
the agony the guilt and the separation 
the memorial on 2 acres adjacent to the parking lot where the 
students were killed includes a granite plaza with four pylons 
similar in shape to elongated gravestones 
a smaller waisthigh marker was erected in honor of the slain 
students in 1971 
although she and her husband louis participated in the 
ceremony the families of miller and allison krause did not show 
up university spokeswoman janet thiede said 
ms krauses mother doris krause of monroeville pa had said 
she did not plan to attend because she believed the memorial should 
have been bigger and built earlier 
the parents of the fourth victim sandra scheuer were on campus 
but did not speak at the ceremonies

exxon said it is paying a total of 62 
million to compensate kodiak and chignik fishermen for 1989 salmon 
losses from the exxon valdez oil spill but angry fishermen say 
its not enough 
the company said friday it had paid about 50 million to kodiak 
fishermen and 4 million to chignik fishermen so far and would pay 
an additional 8 million to the two groups because last years 
neglected salmon run was bigger than anticipated 
most fishing was prohibited last year because of fears the oil 
could enter the food chain through the fish the spills longterm 
effect on salmon fishing isnt yet known 
were not only living by our commitment that we made early on 
to compensate them for everything they expected to get but were 
paying them for an even greater volume of fish said exxon claim 
manager dave shoup 
the fishermen however said they expected more than twice as 
much in additional compensation and accused exxon of breaking 
faith 
theyre about 108 million short of kodiak fishermens 
claims said jeff stephan president of united fishermens 
marketing association in kodiak 
theyve told us all along in a public relations campaign that 
they expect to make the fishermen whole theyve said that to me 
100 times in negotiations and we believed them he said 
well were sitting here in may and the fishermen are nowhere 
near whole 
the major point of contention is whether fishermen should be 
compensated for more than 6 million in salmon harvested at the 
stateowned kitoi hatchery by the hatcherys operator 
fishermen say they suffered by not being the ones to harvest 
those fish and so should be compensated for them by the oil 
company exxon says it wont compensate the fishermen for fish that 
were harvested only for those that werent 
exxons voluntary compensation program doesnt officially settle 
fishermens claims many of which are in lawsuits filed in state 
and federal court the lawsuits include claims of lost 
opportunities mental anguish and and other damages 
kodiak island is about 250 miles southwest of bligh reef in 
prince william sound where the exxon valdez ran aground in march 
24 1989 spilling nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil 
the village of chignik on the alaska peninsula lies across the 
shelikof strait from kodiak 
negotiations will continue with the fishermen over the companys 
voluntary claims program as well shoup said

the spiritual mentor of moslem militants 
holding western hostages says no more of the captives should be 
freed unless israel releases arab prisoners a newspaper reported 
today 
we want the states of the world to pressure israel into 
releasing arab prisoners the same way they exert pressure for the 
release of western hostages alanwar quoted sheik mohammed 
hussein fadlallah as telling a friday prayer sermon 
americans frank reed and robert polhill have been released by 
their lebanese captors in the past two weeks 
most of the remaining 16 westerners missing in lebanon 
including six americans are believed to be held by iranianbacked 
shiite moslem groups in beiruts southern shantytowns a stronghold 
of the fundamentalist hezbollah or party of god 
fadlallah hezbollahs spiritual guide declared we dont 
want the human rights and freedom of anyone to be achieved at our 
expense in apparent rejection of the release of western captives 
without a reciprocal move by israel 
either our people will be free or we will not respect the 
freedom of the world that does not respect our freedom he added 
the conservative alanwar carried the full text of fadlallahs 
address 
the missing westerners comprise six americans four britons two 
swiss two west germans an italian and an irishman american terry 
anderson 42 chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press is the longestheld captive he was kidnapped in moslem west 
beirut march 16 1985 
hezbollah issued a statement friday blaming the united states 
for hindering the release of western captives 
the us administration bears the responsibility for any 
complications in this issue it said 
the ball is now in americas court after the efforts that had 
been exerted by the islamic republic and syria to free two 
americans as a step toward resolving the question of all the 
hostages the statement said 
polhill 55 was freed april 22 after 39 months in captivity 
reed 57 was released eight days later after 42 months as a 
hostage 
iran and syria have called for a reciprocal goodwill gesture 
from the united states 
iranian newspapers and some of the shiite kidnap groups have 
demanded that as a precondition for further hostage releases 
israel frees some 400 palestinian and lebanese prisoners it holds 
the hostageholders also have demanded freedom for 15 convicted 
militants imprisoned in kuwait for the bombing of the us and 
french embassies there in december 1983 
israel and kuwait have refused to negotiate with terrorists and 
the united states has said it would not pressure them into bowing 
to the kidnappers demands

scattered showers helped firefighters bring under 
control a fourdayold blaze that charred an estimated 25000 acres 
of the everglades as it closed in on a federal wildlife preserve 
firefighters counted on the l67 canal as the last line of 
defense between the wall of flames and 150000 droughtcrisp 
wetlands to the west officials are concerned the fire could jump 
the 100footwide canal and move into the sprawling big cypress 
national wildlife preserve 
friday evening firefighters reported they had controlled the 
blaze and would continue monitoring for possible flareups 
with that rain it slowed it down a little bit brought the 
humidity up said john kern of the state division of forestry 
the fire apparently was sparked accidentally in an area 
frequented by people on motorcycles and allterrain vehicles said 
senior state forester gene dempsey 
despite the size of the scorched area about 25 miles west of 
downtown miami wildlife officials say there has been little affect 
on animals because the severe drought already had forced most 
species to water 
we have a few snakes and rodents scurrying away but thats 
about it said senior state forester gene dempsey 
david maehr a florida panther biologist with the state game and 
fresh water fish commission said the 17 cats wearing the agencys 
radiotracking collars were checked friday and were nowhere near 
any danger from fire 
about 30 to 50 panthers are believed to roam the wilds of south 
florida making them one of the worlds rarest mammals 
no inhabited areas were threatened by the blaze one of three 
west of miami 
another fire in everglades national park about 27 miles 
southwest of the city scorched 10500 acres by friday 
firefighters expected to control it today said park spokeswoman 
darlene koontz

a doctor says an italian man contracted the 
aids virus after colliding with an infected drug abuser during a 
soccer game near this northern town 
the incident was first reported in a letter published in the 
latest issue of the lancet a respected british medical journal 
five doctors from the varese regional hospitals infectious 
diseases unit signed the letter 
dr donato torre one of the five said friday other cases of 
transmission of the aids virus from sporting accidents have been 
documented in the united states and britain 
the doctors said the incident occurred when two players crashed 
into each other during an informal soccer game in december near 
varese near the swiss border the virus was apparently transmitted 
from deep cuts to their eyebrows and foreheads 
the letter said that two months after the accident during a 
routine blood test the previously uninfected mans blood serum was 
found to carry the hiv1 virus which causes aids a year before 
the injury another routine blood test had shown he was uninfected 
in the telephone interview torre said the other man involved 
was a member of a soccer team made up of players from a drug 
rehabilitation center 
in the absence of other risk factors this case is compatible 
with the acquisition of hiv1 infection by traumatic contact with a 
seropositive man the letter said 
aids is a deadly affliction in which a virus attacks the bodys 
immune system leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of 
infections and cancers it is spread mainly by sexual contact the 
use of contaminated needles among drug abusers and transfusion of 
tainted blood 
the doctors who signed the letter said the patient who 
contracted the aids virus after the collision denied drug abuse he 
had not had blood transfusions injections or dental care and he 
had not been to such highrisk areas as africa or the caribbean 
he has been in a stable relationship for four years with a woman 
who was uninfected and he did not have sex with other women the 
letter said 
the men were not identified for reasons of privacy 
in the telephone interview torre said new standard procedures 
were needed to handle such accidents 
its logical that when accident victims suffer lesions with 
bleeding and they come into contact with another accident victim 
such as in a car accident they should be tested immediately for 
the hiv virus he said

national institute of geophysics in rome the temblor at 930 am 
230 am edt and subsequent aftershocks sent frightened 
residents running into the streets 
southern italy has been struck by devastating temblors in the 
past including one in 1980 that killed about 3000 people in the 
naples region 
the epicenter was about 95 miles southeast of naples however 
the temblor was felt as far south as the regions of calabria and 
puglia the toe and heel of the italian boot 
two people were injured in potenza about 80 miles southeast of 
naples when chunks of molding fell from the walls inside their 
homes 
damage to older buildings was reported but the extent was not 
immeditely clear 
the national telephone company sip reported lines were tied up 
by calls to fire departments and other authorities it issued a 
statement asking people to limit their calls to emergency cases 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph every increase of one number means that the ground 
motion is 10 times greater 
a quake of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage in populated 
areas while one measuring 5 can cause considerable damage

fearing more deadly attacks on 
candidates the government is buying radio and tv ads for 
presidential hopefuls to cut down on risky public appearances 
three presidential candidates have been killed since august 
when drug traffickers launched a war against the government that 
has left nearly 300 people dead the traffickers are blamed for at 
least two of the assassinations 
in the drug capital of medellin on friday police killed six 
unidentified men during a shootout at a shopping center 
the decree by president virgilio barco earmarked 340000 to 
allow all 13 contenders for may 27 elections to buy air time the 
thursday order increased free time on governmentowned television 
for candidates speeches 
it also said voters will decide whether the countrys 
constitution should be reformed there is widespread support for 
proposals intended to strengthen the judicial system and reduce the 
drug cartels influence in the congress 
the urgent strengthening of institutions is necessary for a 
return to normality and to overcome a situation in which public 
security is constantly disturbed said the presidential decree 
the proposal would need the support of 51 percent of the voters 
despite the government help in campaign advertising 
presidential candidate cesar gaviria of the governing liberal party 
traveled friday to the eastern city of bucaramanga his campaign 
said he would make a series of appearances in public plazas 
gaviria had suspended his campaign activities after the april 26 
assassination of carlos pizarro a leftist presidential contender 
and former guerrilla leader an assassin shot and killed pizarro 
the candidate for the april 19 movement aboard a colombian 
jetliner 
in previous months of the campaign candidates sen luis carlos 
galan of the liberal party and bernardo jaramillo of the patriotic 
union were assassinated the slaying of galan in august set off a 
usbacked government crackdown on the traffickers 
authorities say they believe the assassins of galan and 
jaramillo were working for drug traffickers the media citing 
security sources have reported drug traffickers were the main 
suspects in pizarros killing but the medellin cartel denied 
involvement and no government official has yet said who was 
responsible 
also friday a government official blamed druglords for a 
carbomb attack that killed four people including a 3yearold 
girl in the southern city of cali on thursday night 
the cali car bomb which carried 220 pounds of dynamite wounded 
36 people and destroyed several buildings when it exploded in front 
of a drugstore in the citys commercial district 
this was a demented attack carried out by persons tied to the 
medellin cartel raul caicedo the secretary of calis municipal 
government told the rcn radio network on friday 
the drugstore was one of a chain belonging to gilberto 
rodriguez the reputed leader of the cali cocaine cartel 
authorities blamed the medellin cartel for several bombings of 
drugstores in the chain in 1988 and 1989 
during that time the two cartels fought a war for control of 
the new york city cocaine market

nicaraguan rebels today agreed with 
the new government to begin disarming next week and the president 
violeta barrios de chamorro pledged to start reducing the size of 
the sandinistacontrolled army if carried out the agreement will 
mean an end to a decadeold civil war between thousands of 
usbacked contra rebels and the previous leftist sandinista 
government an estimated 30000 people have died in the fighting 
mrs chamorro also said weapons given to civilian sandinista 
supporters by the outgoing administration should be recovered and 
destroyed 
israel galeano the contra commander agreed his forces would 
begin disarming tuesday the accord which was reached after a 
15hour meeting that ended at 1 am today said the rebel fighters 
would be disarmed by june 10 
the accord said the security of the rebels and their families 
camped with them would be guaranteed 
the bulk of the rebel army estimated at between 9000 and 
12000 fighters has returned to nicaragua from honduran base camps 
in the past few months many are in security zones supervised by 
un peacekeepeers 
the rebels had previously agreed to surrender their weapons by 
june 10 but then stalled saying they wanted the army to be 
disbanded first the army is controlled by the sandinista front 
which lost national elections to mrs chamorros usbacked 
opposition coalition in february 
mrs chamorro who is also acting as defense minister did not 
specify by how much the army would be reduced but promised to do so 
by the date of the contra demobilization 
on june 10 we will announce the program of the reduction of 
the armed forces ordered in my inaugural address of april 25th 
and whose implementation should begin immediately mrs chamorro 
said 
her government has also forced top officers to leave the party 
in a move intended to depoliticize the army 
todays announcements followed closeddoor talks that began 
friday members of mrs chamorros cabinet and nicaraguas roman 
catholic cardinal miguel obando y bravo also attended 
galeano said friday the fact that the contras were meeting with 
mrs chamorro shows a willingness to work to rebuild a society 
that is destroyed 
many contras are angry over mrs chamorros decision to keep 
gen humberto ortega as head of the army although she said the 
post would be temporary ortega brother of former president daniel 
ortega had been defense minister under the sandinistas 
when mrs chamorro took office april 25 she charged gen ortega 
with coming up with a program for reducing the armed forces in 
keeping with contra demands however she said ortega would stay on 
as head of the army until the contras were disarmed

gay rights activists have demanded 
scientific proof from a foundation promoting therapy and sports as 
cures for homosexuality 
robert austin president of the utah aids coalition condemned 
the notion that sexual orientation can be changed 
reorientation therapy is to psychiatry what bloodletting is to 
the healing arts he said 
austin commented friday as 120 social workers and therapists 
gathered for the opening of a twoday conference sponsored by the 
evergreen foundation a selfdescribed group of former homosexuals 
dedicated to helping others abandon gay lifestyles 
the foundation touts development of athletic skills to spur the 
transition to heterosexuality but conference organizers conceded 
they have no studies to back up their views 
instead they cited anecdotal cases and testimonials from 
exhomosexuals that homosexuality can be cured 
jeff konrad said he was able to change his homosexual 
orientation by playing sports and relating to men in a nonsexual 
way through a support group 
i was an isolated shy person and i didnt play baseball he 
said a lot of gay men arent good at sports i didnt have 
enough selfconfidence to go after that ball and when the ball 
came i wasnt aggressive all i needed was love pushing and a 
masculine role model 
joe dallas of orange calif a fundamentalist christian 
therapist told conference goers that while not technically an 
illness homosexuality is a symptom of inner conflict often 
stemming from a childhood devoid of proper male identity 
development 
he said he has helped 70 people achieve significant sexual 
reorientation or modified behavior during the last three years 
i need more time perhaps five to nine years to do a 
followup study that would be more credible dallas said but 
none of my clients have renounced our efforts 
austin said the majority of mental health professionals agree 
that sexual orientation cannot be changed 
he predicted that the foundations yearold treatment program 
would fall on the ash heap of history joining the notion that 
homosexuality is a mental disease an idea rejected by the 
american psychiatric association in 1973 
it will not fall without its victims austin said gay and 
lesbian teens haunted by confusion over their affectation attempt 
suicide three times as often as their heterosexual counterparts 
i find the very idea of professionals in the mental health 
professions adding to that despair and confusion by offering false 
hopes of reorientation to be unconscionable he said 
evergreen president alan seegmiller said his organization 
reflects christian values which can sometimes be the force that 
prompts homosexuals to seek change he said 40 to 50 members of the 
foundation are members of the mormon church which condemns 
homosexuality as a serious sin 
we respect gays who are happy with their lifestyle but we do 
believe that the most complete actualized person will be 
heterosexual he said i see homosexuality as just the red 
light on the dash that says check under the hood somethings the 
matter here 
austin was joined at a news conference by a minister a social 
worker and several mormon homosexuals who recounted painful 
memories of various treatments that failed 
mark hansen said one mormon counselor had him hang a poster of a 
woman in a string bikini above his bed to change sexual 
orientation while another therapist said to remove the poster 
because it was wrong to replace one perversion with another 
perversion 
still another counselor had hansen place a pinto bean in his 
shoe he said each time he felt the bean i was told to say to 
myself i am completely heterosexual 
the church of jesus christ of latterday saints while making 
occasional referrals to the program is not affiliated with the 
foundation said spokesman don lefevre 
lds social services professionals view the foundation as a 
support group or resource he said 
in the late 1960s churchowned brigham young university offered 
homosexual students aversion therapy including electroshock 
treatments but abandoned the experiment when it was determined 
to be ineffective lefevre said 
now the church offers individual and group therapy for both 
those with homosexual orientation and for family members who seek 
it it is a spiritually based therapy

countrys acreage this year of the main ingredient in cocaine us 
officials say 
in april coca leaf farmers destroyed 2700 acres of plants 
bringing the total since dec 1 to 9800 acres the us embassy 
said friday that represents over onetenth of the 94000 acres 
devoted to coca cultivation it said 
farmers receive 2000 from the bolivian government for every 2 
acres destroyed 
but the government says it is having trouble making the payments 
because of a faltering economy treasury officials indicate the 
funding of educational health and other government programs are 
delayed because of payments made to coca leaf farmers 
the ninemonthold government of president jaime paz zamora is 
to meet with president bush in washington next week to discuss 
cooperation in fighting cocaine trafficking 
the us government is expected to provide at least 60 million 
this year for military and police assistance to combat cocaine 
trafficking in bolivia 
the voluntary coca eradication program took off late last year 
in response to a sharp drop in coca leaf prices brought about by 
the colombian antidrug crackdown and increased interdiction 
activities in bolivia the antidrug crackdown has disrupted 
cocaine production and resulted in a glut of coca leaves 
a 100 pound sack of coca is selling for around 10 while the 
cost of production is estimated at 30 a similar weight of leaf 
sold for 200 to 300 five years ago 
farmers are lining up in front of government offices to sign up 
for the coca reduction program and tens of thousands of farmers 
have left the chapare coca leaf producing region in recent months 
in response to the sharp drop in coca leaf prices 
the fact that the voluntary eradiction program has begun to 
show significant progress proves that interdiction eradication and 
alternative development programs are three interdependent parts of 
an integrated strategy and must be pursued simultaneoulsy and with 
equal strength us ambassador robert gelbard said in an 
interview 
the voluntary coca eradication program is taking place in the 
chapare a lush tropical region in the heart of bolivia that 
produces nearly a third of the worlds coca leaves at least 
300000 farmers depend on coca leaf cultivation and cocaine 
production for their livelihood 
the leaves which resemble bay leaves are grown on bushes and 
are harvested four times a year after they are dried they are 
macerated with kerosene in plastic covered pits to become paste 
after further processings in labs located in the bolivian lowlands 
as well as in colombia and brazil the paste is transformed into 
cocaine 
the bolivian government says the country must be developed as a 
whole in order to wean farmers away from coca cultivation bolivia 
with a population of 71 million is the poorest country and the 
largest recepient of us aid in south america 
at least 300 million enters the bolivian economy from cocaine 
trafficking

a suspected communist guerrilla 
fatally shot a us marine near an americanrun base prompting 
cancellation of offbase leave for all us military personnel in 
the country officials said today 
the friday night attack near subic naval base came after 
authorities said they had evidence communist guerrillas planned to 
kill americans before talks begin this month on extending the 
bases lease 
rebels waging a 21yearold marxist insurgency are also 
suspected of having killed at least 14 people including a town 
mayor in attacks in the central and southern philippines since 
thursday 
gunnery sgt john s fredette 34 of buena park calif was 
slain in the liberty town of olongapo near the base about 50 miles 
west of manila according to a spokesman for the subic facility 
fredette was assigned to marine fighterattack squadron 323 
which is on temporary duty in the philippines from its base at the 
marine air station in el toro calif said spokesman petty officer 
john moore 
a police investigator patrolman romeo de guzman said fredette 
was walking along a sidestreet in olongapo when one of five 
suspected communist new peoples army members shot him once in the 
neck with a handgun the five escaped on foot after the shooting 
fredette was rushed to the subic base hospital where he died one 
hour later de guzman added de guzman said the killing has all 
the earmarks of a communist assassination but did not elaborate 
following the killing us authorities canceled offbase leave 
and nonessential travel for the 40000 us troops defense 
department civilians and military dependents at subic and the five 
other usrun bases throughout the country 
last month the navy barred most nonessential travel to manila 
but had allowed sailors to visit olongapo traditionally among the 
safest cities in the philippines 
us ambassador nicholas platt expressed his shock and sorrow 
at the cowardly murder of fredette said us embassy spokeswoman 
victoria middleton 
the incident is under investigation by both us naval and 
philippine authorities a filipino intelligence officer who 
refused to be identified said investigators have identified two of 
the assailants as rebels operating in the nearby province of bataan 
filipino and us authorities have been concerned after local 
military officials reported an alleged member of the communist new 
peoples army hit squad was arrested in olongapo last week and four 
other members of the team were still at large 
documents seized from the arrested man dionisio bendoy 
indicated a plan by the insurgents to assassinate americans in the 
city before the opening of talks on may 14 on the future of six 
us military facilities in the philippines 
the united states maintains the subic base clark air base and 
four other smaller facilities in the country under a 1947 pact that 
expires in september 1991 the rebels have demanded the bases be 
closed 
the rebels traditionally have not operated in the olongapo area 
because of strong public support for the bases rebels do operate 
around clark air base in central luzon 
ms middleton said security was tightened at american facilities 
in manila about two months ago because of fears of a rebel attack 
last september guerrillas killed two civilian employees of camp 
odonnell a us air force post near clark 
in october 1987 communist rebels gunned down three americans in 
simultaneous attacks outside clark 
at least three other americans have been killed elsewhere in the 
country in the past four years including us army col james 
nick rowe who was ambushed april last year while on his way to 
work in a manila suburb

a fastmoving flow of sizzling lava from 
kilauea volcano cut this deserted town in two friday and raced 
toward a final fiery climax with the ocean 
a portion of the flow which had moved about a third of a mile 
since thursday night cut a speeding path around the towns hub 
part of the flow was filling up a gully that separated the 
molten mass from the kalapana store and drivein and the kalapana 
mauna kea congregational church 
star of the sea church a roman catholic church known as the 
painted church because of its colorful murals was moved 
beating by a few hours a portion of the flow that crossed highway 
137 halfway between the town and harry k brown state park a 
quarter of a mile away 
three more homes burned friday to boost the count to 134 since 
kilauea began its current eruption in january 1983 three of the 
last families to flee the area managed to move their belongings 
before their homes were cut off by the encroaching flow 
a tractor trailer began moving the church about 7 am friday 
it was brought to a roadside area where other houses that were 
salvaged are located 
church officials have not said where the church will be 
relocated 
an elderly native hawaiian woman pleaded with workers and 
officials not to move the church but bishop joseph ferrario 
decided last week to move it to preserve its interior paintings 
how can you move it how can you move it the woman screamed 
at workers preparing to move the church 
others echoed similar sentiments 
how can you call it star of the sea church if it isnt by the 
sea asked kapena kamahele a hilo resident whose family has a 
long history in kalapana 
kamahele said the destruction of kalapana one of the last 
vestiges of the old style hawaii was seen by many longtime 
residents as the punishment for mistreatment of the land 
many of the newer nonhawaiian people who moved to the area 
failed to understand the hawaiian village lifestyle that many in 
this coastal community held sacred she said 
we are erasing the chalkboard and starting from scratch 
kamahele said hawaiians will teach all people how to do it 
civil defense officials ordered members of the congregational 
church who had spent the night in the building to evacuate friday 
morning 
the book is closed we open a new book today said bernice 
mckeague church moderator 
church members held a prayer vigil thursday night and watched as 
the lava built up in a small gully behind the church 
the kalapana store the meeting center of the town remained 
standing just like its owner said it would 
madam pele hawaiis volcano goddess will never take me 
said walter yamaguchi the 82yearold owner he said he left some 
supplies in the store to sell once it reopened 
however the flow continued to build behind his store 
of increasing concern to authorities was the threat to public 
health when the lava begins to fall into the ocean 
when lava hits the water it explodes and releases gases 
including hydrochloric acid a strongsmelling chemical that is 
quite dangerous said civil defense spokesman bud trulson

latvian economists moved quickly today to 
bolster the republics declaration of independence by announcing 
plans for a currency that could be traded internationally 
the republics legislature on friday joined neighboring 
lithuania and estonia in declaring independence from the soviet 
union 50 years after the kremlin annexed the three baltic 
republics however latvia took a more gradual approach than 
lithuania saying full independence would come only after an 
indefinite period of negotiations with soviet authorities 
latvian president anatoly gorbunov said lowlevel talks were 
expected to begin may 15 everything is ahead he said said 
after the vote friday this is only the very very beginning 
soviet leaders had no immediate reaction to latvias move 
gorbunov said at an evening news conference that the latvian 
government had received a proposal from estonian president arnold 
ruutel to start immediate coordinated actions on the two republics 
drives for independence 
economists of the new latvia fund today told a news conference 
in riga the republican capital that work was under way to restore 
the presoviet latvian currency the lat 
the fund created last month plans to immediately issue bonds 
and lottery tickets that can be sold abroad for 11 million to 
finance the creation and printing of the new currency they said 
the lat may enter circulation coexisting with the 
nonconvertible soviet ruble as early as next year fund members 
predicted 
this is not theory this is a concrete step to independence 
said jazeps barkans director of latvian television and a fund 
member 
in addition to voting 1380 vote for independence latvian 
lawmakers also decided on friday to drop the words soviet 
socialist from the republics name making it simply the 
republic of latvia 
their call for a gradual break with the soviet union however 
contrasted with the lithuanian decision on march 11 to declare 
complete independence 
gorbunov said he could not predict what the soviets would say 
but he added that the latvian government had tried to make it clear 
that there is no cause to close the door on dialogue and start 
setting ultimatums 
fiftyseven antiindependence lawmakers refused to cast ballots 
in the assembly of just under 200 members even so the measure had 
no problem achieving the twothirds majority needed for approval 
after the vote was announced latvians inside and outside the 
hall broke into a chorus of god bless latvia the republics 
traditional anthem a cheering crowd showered emerging lawmakers 
with roses pansies and daffodils latvians danced in the streets 
of riga 
i waited my whole life for this said ilma kaminska 65 who 
said she remembered when latvia was forcibly annexed by soviet 
dictator joseph stalin in 1940 i believed i always believed 
she said with tears in her eyes 
however about 300 people gathered on rigas cathedral square 
this morning to hear speakers mounted on an army truck say the 
independence declaration was illegal and should be revoked the 
rally was organized by interfront which includes ethnic russians 
and other nonlatvian residents 
the independence bill was championed by the proindependence 
latvian peoples front that dominates the parliament 
the neighboring republic of estonia took a similar step march 30 
lithuania which declared full independence is now suffering 
from a kremlinimposed economic blockade of oil natural gas and 
other raw materials 
in his comments friday gorbunov said latvia could offer its 
solidarity but had few resources for economic help 
in washington lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene 
appealed on friday for western backing she said a strong 
declaration of support could be decisive in lithuanias drive 
she said she continues to hope that president bush and other 
world leaders can yet be persuaded that embracing independence for 
lithuania and its baltic neighbors will not undermine soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev and his program of political and 
economic reform

students at universities around the country protested the 
exclusion of homosexuals from the reserve officers training corps 
and an assembly at one school threatened to withhold credit for 
rotc courses 
the activities friday at 25 campuses were coordinated by 
students at the university of wisconsinmadison 
at the university of kansas the school senate proposed that

commissioning ceremonies on university property until the issue is 
resolved 
university of washington students in seattle adopted a 
resolution calling on the schools regents to lobby the states 
congressional delegation to help change the discriminatory law 
these students may be just as disciplined and capable as any 
other soldier sailor pilot or officer but because of their 
sexual preference or orientation they are barred from serving in 
the armed forces students association president heidi wills said 
this is treating a segment of our student body as 
secondclass citizens she said 
declarations also were made friday at northwestern the 
university of california at los angeles and the massachusetts 
institute of technology among other schools 
about 20 ohio state university students gathered outside the 
administration building to protest the presence of rotc on the 
campus students carried signs including one that read the few 
the proud the gay 
rotc is such a big part of this campus and they wont let us 
in the university is hypocritical and needs to live up to their 
stated policy of nondiscrimination based on sexual orientation 
said mike scarce vice president of the gay and lesbian alliance

bloody 1980 coup from the descendants of freed us slaves who 
founded liberia in 1847 
but about 400 of the 500 american personnel and their dependents 
have left liberia in recent days as rebel forces have moved to

but an authorized voluntary departure 
before the departures got under way there were about 5000 
americans in liberia there are no precise figures available on the 
number americans in unofficial capacities who have left

nato and warsaw pact countries say they 
will not be able to reach agreement by next week as planned on 
terms for monitoring each others airspace according to news 
reports today 
however both sides still hope for an accord this year the 
reports said 
about 250 experts from the countries are meeting in budapest for 
a second round of talks in the socalled open skies conference 
the conference is intended to build trust between the two 
military blocs by opening their skies to surveillance flights that 
would allow other countries to monitor their military activities 
at the first round of talks in ottawa canada in february the 
participants set a tentative may 12 deadline for signing an accord 
by the foreign ministers of the 16 nato and seven warsaw pact 
nations 
tibor toth head of the hungarian delegation to the talks said 
it now appeared certain the two sides would not be able to reach 
agreement by then the daily nepszabadsag reported 
us and soviet negotiators said last week they did not expect 
the conference to meet its deadline citing major outstanding 
problems that still needed to be resolved but they too have 
said they would like to see an accord signed by the end of the year 
there is already agreement that the size of a country should 
determine how many surveillance flights it is allotted 
but the united states and the soviet union disagree on a number 
of key issues including the type of plane and equipment used and 
how information obtained from the flights should be used 
the soviet union would like the information to be pooled but 
the united states wants information sharing to be voluntary

crown prince abdallah bin abdul aziz of 
saudi arabia arrived today for talks with syrian leaders on ending 
a longstanding rift with iraq and forging a new arab unity 
damascus is the princes first stop on a tour of key arab 
capitals amid efforts to mediate a rapprochement between syria and 
iraq and to convene an emergency arab summit in the iraqi capital 
baghdad 
abdallah is also scheduled to visit baghdad and cairo 
he also is expected to try to end the 7yearold feud between 
president hafez assad and palestine liberation organization 
chairman yasser arafat in 1983 syrianbacked radical palestinian 
factions mutinied and drove plo forces out of their last lebanese 
stronghold 
ending these rifts would overcome the last major obstacles to 
organizing the strongest show of arab unity in decades it would 
also open the way for a baghdad summit later this month 
last month arafat called for a baghdad summit to discuss the 
massive emigration of soviet jews to israel and other pressing 
middle east issues 
iraqi president saddam hussein wants to host the summit and show 
that the arab world supports him amid what he views as a 
concentrated western campaign against iraqs drive to build up its 
military arsenal 
the united states and britain say authorities intercepted 
nuclear trigger devices and components for a huge super gun as 
they were being smuggled from britain to iraq experts believe the 
gun would have been capable of firing chemical weapons at israel 
saddam claims the western effort is aimed at setting the stage 
for an israeli attack on iraqs burgeoning military installations 
the saudi envoys visit to damascus coincided with a visit to 
baghdad by king hussein of jordan to persuade saddam to reconcile 
with syrias assad 
but the syrian president told visiting egyptian president hosni 
mubarak on thursday that he will not attend the baghdad summit 
because he was not consulted in advance 
arab league sources said the 22member organizations 
secretarygeneral chadli bendjedid plans to visit damascus to 
persuade syria to attend 
prince abdallah is also chairman of an arab league committee 
assigned to clear panarab obstacles the committee formed at 
the 1982 arab summit in morocco was instrumental in promoting a 
rapprochement between syria and jordan 
syria and egypt recently resumed ties taking arabs a step 
closer to the unity that has eluded them for decades libya has 
also moved toward patching up its differences with egypt 
most arab nations broke relations with cairo over its 1979 peace 
treaty with israel but egypt has gradually reestablished ties 
with most arab nations since 1987 when an arab summit welcomed it 
back into the arab fold 
in addition syria and jordan improved relations in 1985 after 
years of dispute last year syria restored ties with morocco that 
were broken in 1986 
and marxist south yemen and conservative north yemen are 
striving toward unity after a 20year split

germany and shevardnadze said today moscow remained opposed to 
nato membership for a united germany according to adn east 
germanys governmentrun news agency he said such an arrangement 
would be incompatible with soviet security interests it said 
the foreign minister asked his counterparts at the table for 
understanding adn reported 
baker and british foreign secretary douglas hurd tried to ease 
the soviet fears said a british official who briefed reporters on 
condition of anonymity 
he quoted hurd as saying we are seeing a changing nato we 
are moving away from the vocabulary of the cold war 
we have difficult problems to solve genscher said in his 
opening remarks after they had sat down at a round table inside the 
foreign ministrys main conference room however if we are all 
willing not only to defend our own interests but also to respect 
the interests of our partners then we will find solutions 
genscher started his remarks distributed to reporters 
beforehand by calling to mind the immeasurable suffering 
caused by world war ii and the nazi dictatorship 
he also mentioned the helsinki final act regulating relations 
among european countries as he rebuffed moscows opposition to a 
unified germany in the usled atlantic alliance 
the final act emphasizes quite distinctly that all principles 
are of primary significance genscher said in this connection 
i refer to the principle of sovereign equality which gives all 
participating states the right to be or not to be a party to 
treaties of alliance 
since we know that the western alliance adapting itself as it 
does to the changes in europe brings about peace and security a 
freestanding united germany would be of no benefit to europe he 
added 
baker and hurd echoed genschers position that it was for the 
germans alone to decide whether they want to belong to an alliance 
baker said in his opening statement the united states and the 
other allied powers that carved up germany after the nazi defeat 45 
years ago should not impose special restrictions on a united 
germany thereby planting seeds of future instability 
today we engage in an act of reconcialition of a people too 
long separated of a continent too long divided baker said 
shevardnadze was conciliatory in his statement according to the 
british official he accepted entirely the selfdetermination of 
the german people the official said 
neither shevardnadze nor baker dwelled on germanys nazi past 
we dont want a discussion on obsolete views the british 
official quoted shevardnadze as saying 
baker said we face the challenge of rising above the past 
the british official said french foreign minister roland dumas 
called for poland to become involved in the unification talks at 
the third meeting of the foreign ministers to be held in paris a 
date has not been set 
while genscher has said a united germany will be in nato he 
also has offered to let the soviets keep some of their troops in 
what is now east germany for a transitional period 
about 250000 us troops are stationed in west germany with an 
estimated 380000 soviet troops in east germany

voters surrendered to apathy or uncritical 
acceptance of george bushs campaign ads in the 1988 presidential 
election a political study panel concludes 
american voters today do not seem to understand their rightful 
place in the operation of american democracy the panel said in a 
report saturday they act as if they believe that presidential 
elections belong to somebody else most notably presidential 
candidates and their handlers 
the panel eight figures from politics the media political 
science and public policy analysis spent two years on the 
project they used polls focus group interviews and analysis of 
news coverage of the election 
folks have basically checked out said bruce buchanan 
executive director of the panel and associate professor of 
government at the university of texas 
the panel was assembled by the markle foundation which studies 
the role of mass communications in a democratic society 
two months before the election a third of the people could not 
name dan quayle as bushs running mate and nearly a half couldnt 
name lloyd bentsen as michael dukakis wouldbe vice president 
buchanan said 
just weeks before the election 22 percent still could not name 
quayle and 30 percent could not identify bentsen he said 
moreover the group said most citizens did not inform 
themselves well enough to be able to recognize mistruths in the 
bush campaigns paid advertising 
when we asked voters what they had learned about each 
candidate particularly dukakis they said they learned that he 
was willing to furlough convicted murderers and had no concern 
about the pollution of boston harbor buchanan said what they 
didnt know was the extent to which the advertising squared with a 
reasonable construction of the facts 
the panel also blamed the news media and the candidates 
themselves for what it called a failure to live up their 
responsibilities 
most coverage especially on television concentrated on the 
horse race aspects of the election who is leading and the 
personalities of the contestants rather than the candidates 
qualifications or the issues 
even when the news focused on campaign advertising it 
emphasized the guile of the republicans commercials and the 
ineffectiveness of the democrats rather than the veracity of the 
claims the commission said 
the panel expressed dismay at the turnout 501 percent of 
eligible voters actually cast ballots the lowest percentage in 64 
years 
even as enthusiasm for democracy ignites around the globe it 
is waning in the very nation whose political traditions inspire 
others the panel said 
the panel called for congressional pressure for 
institutionalized candidate debates and free air time to educate 
voters it said the news media should assume a more substantive 
role in seeking the truth in candidate claims in advertising and 
should overcome candidates attempts to misuse the media 
the panel also called for keeping polls open for 20 hours on 
election day for eliciting broadcasters cooperating in not 
projecting winners until the polls are closed everywhere and for 
simpler registration procedures 
members of the panel were robert oneil president of the 
university of virginia chairman james david barber duke 
university political scientist former sens john c culver 
diowa and charles mathias rmd joan konner dean of the 
columbia university graduate school of journalism eugene 
patterson editor emeritus of the st petersburg fla times and 
eddie n williams president of the joint center for policy studies

thousands of americans face as much as 500 
million in unpaid medical bills because they relied on thinly 
funded and often fraudulent health plans that collapsed according 
to a published report 
a threemonth investigation by the gannett news service found 
that many of the defunct health plans were the work of con artists 
who preyed on small businesses and their employees 
some failures can be blamed on business errors and 
mismanagement the investigation found but others resulted because 
the plan operators paid themselves big salaries and ran up huge 
expense accounts then quit paying claims and moved on 
state and federal authorities including postal inspectors the 
office of labor racketeering and the fbi are pursuing civil and 
criminal investigations of dozens of health plans across the 
country gannett said 
at least two federal indictments already have been handed up 
and more are expected over the next few months the report said 
the senate investigations subcommittee chaired by sen sam nunn 
dga has scheduled hearings on the problem for may 1415 
the gannett investigation found that while many victims were 
left without health coverage the plans provided handsome 
lifestyles for their operators 
for example michael rubell and james helm owners of rubell 
helm insurance services of irvine calif which owes millions in 
unpaid claims in florida texas and california took 7100aweek 
salaries gannett said 
rubell and helms tailor got 115000 in company funds in less 
than a year the newspaper chain said citing court documents in a 
lawsuit brought by california against the pair they declined to 
talk to gannett for the story 
by contrast many victims are of modest means such as teachers 
service station attendants and textile mill workers they work for 
small employers sometimes the owner and family members are the 
only people covered who find it nearly impossible to get 
affordable health insurance coverage 
the groups of people who are victimized are the ones who can 
least afford the hit said norman transeth a labor department 
investigator looking into health insurance fraud 
for instance richard flaherty was awaiting double bypass heart 
surgery at a hospital in sparks nev last june when word came 
that health insurance coverage sold through his trade association 
wasnt any good 
a retired service station operator flaherty still owes about 
120000 in medical bills his insurance claim is part of a federal 
lawsuit to settle the dispute over who should pay the bills 
the health plans that have collapsed in recent years are known 
collectively as multiple employer trusts or multiple employer 
welfare arrangements they cover employees of a group of companies 
usually small businesses 
unlike traditional health plans provided by large companies 
labor unions and government mets and mewas often are not fully or 
even partly covered by insurance firms and because regulations are 
lax the gannett investigation showed the plans seldom are 
required to hold reserves against losses 
instead they rely on monthly contributions to cover claims and 
operating expenses but in many cases gannett found expenses are 
inflated and premiums are kept low to attract participants when 
claims exceed expectations the plans cannot pay 
all too many of these are nothing more than ponzi schemes 
said raymond maria acting labor department inspector general who 
is working to expose what he calls a burgeoning problem of 
fraud 
in a ponzi scheme current income is used to pay off previous 
investors when new investments slow and income declines the 
scheme collapses

london telephones jangle to new numbers on sunday 
when area codes 71 and 81 replace the simple no 1 
if only it were that simple 
i am totally confident that all the necessary adjustments will 
be made as planned on sunday said millie banerjee general 
manager of british telecoms london network 
she was speaking only for the company not the customer 
british telecom is ready for up to 50000 misdialed calls per 
minute and has prepared recorded messages in the appropriate 
languages to intercept international calls placed with the wrong 
number 
for international callers london numbers will be preceded by 
the country code 44 and either 71 or 81 depending on location in 
the city 
callers within britain will be dialing 071 or 081 instead of 01 
with britain enjoying a threeday weekend the real test wont 
come until tuesday when banks exchanges and businesses reopen 
telecom says london is the foreign city that receives the most 
calls from the united states up to 100000 a day 
because of the proliferation of fax machines and directdial 
business systems that assign a telephone number to every desk 
telecom said it had used up nearly all the potential 5 million 
numbers in the old london exchange 
splitting the city will double the pool 
the 71 code has been assigned to inner london within 
approximately 4 miles of charing cross and 81 to the outer reaches 
john turner telecoms communications manager for the code 
change said friday that as many as onefourth of the 380000 
businesses in london had not reprogrammed their telephones or fax 
machines 
david fletcher chief executive of the british security industry 
association estimated that as many as onefourth of the capitals 
100000 burglar alarms had not been adjusted to contact the new 
numbers 
some people are upset by the change many believe that 
selfesteem and property values are bound to decline in areas with 
the 81 code such as finchley hornsey shepherds bush hammersmith 
wembley putney and tooting 
elsie burch donald author of debretts etiquette and modern 
manners laid down the law a year ago 071 will be a superior 
number to have clearly there is an advantage socially culturally 
economically to be living in central london 
judging from letters to london newspapers however the new 
telephone numbers are being taken in stride only one gripe was 
noted in the major papers last week 
well be 081 and nobody gives a damn said elaine howard 
manager of a real estate office in blackheath i have heard it 
will make a difference to the market but so far its all rumor 
the change should be simple for britons accustomed to wrestling 
with telecoms maddening provincial directories which list 
telephone numbers and city codes in separate sections 
if youre dialing a number in piddletrenthide for instance you 
find the number in the white pages and the city code in the pink 
03004 for threedigit numbers or 0300 for sixdigit numbers 
sir bryan carsberg directorgeneral of the office of 
telecommunications advised spending a few moments to prepare 
change your personal telephone lists reprogram that pushbutton 
telephone check that fax machine lay in a supply of stickon 
labels to correct obsolete stationery he urged 
sir bryan according to a statement released by his office 
wishes the telephone operating companies and you the 
allimportant customers a successful changeover to the new london 
numbering scheme

the place of honor in the church of the 
presidents is not in the front row but back toward the cheap 
seats 
pew 54 at st johns church is where george and barbara bush sit 
when they visit the landmark building across lafayette square from 
the white house as they often do on sundays when they are in 
washington 
every president since james madison has worshipped in the yellow 
episocopal church at least once and it was madison himself who 
choose pew 54 as the presidents row 
the rev john c harper pastor of st johns since 1963 savors 
the symbolism of americas president being seated in the midst of 
the people instead of the front pew 
the bushes are at camp david md this weekend so they will not 
be on hand for a service sunday at which the presiding bishop of 
the episcopal church edmond browning will lead the parish in 
celebrating its 175th anniversary 
but harper provided a taste of st johns history for the bushes 
and the few dozen others who turned out for the 8 am communion 
service last sunday 
he called st johns nestled between the headquarters of the 
aflcio and the veterans affairs department a symbol of small 
power amid great power a reminder that not all of the things in 
this life are large 
the yellow stucco church was designed by benjamin henry latrobe 
the same architect who oversaw the construction of the us capitol 
and the rebuilding of the white house after it was burned by the 
british in the war of 1812 
the cornerstone was laid in 1815 and the first services held a 
few years later shortly thereafter the congregation decided to 
expand the compact crossshaped byzantine structure and a nave 
belltower and columned porch were added 
not that all the services were packed john adams complained in 
his diary after returning from a service in 1828 there were 
scarcely 30 persons in the house the neglect of public worship in 
this city is an increasing evil 
although they frequently attend st johns the bushes remain on 
the parish roll of another episcopal church st martins in their 
hometown of houston 
the harvardeducated harper a new england contemporary of 
bushs has seen seven presidents during his 27 years at st 
johns john f kennedy attended his installation in 1963 and sat 
in the front pew 
lyndon johnson slipped into the church for prayer in november 
1963 the day after kennedys assassination gerald ford worshipped 
there frequently ronald reagan attended services on the mornings 
of his two inaugurations and on sunday march 29 1981 the day 
before he was wounded in an assassination attempt 
bush and dan quayle both showed up for a prayer service on the 
morning of their inaugurations last year 
harper in an interview said of preaching before a president 
i dont want to sound blase but its no big deal ive never 
tailored my sermons to whoever is coming 
a literary man and onetime english teacher harper also does not 
thunder over affairs of state 
its not my style im a pastoral preacher im not a 
prophetic preacher he said 
when i was called here to be rector i remember saying to the 
vestry you really dont want me what you ought to have in that 
pulpit is somebody who can make the headlines of the washington 
post on monday morning someone like bishop pike they said 
oh no no no we dont he recalled 
instead they got what harper called a gardenvariety pastor 
who has succeeded in building the congregations rolls to more than 
1000 and reducing the average age of the vestry to 43 
when i came here they the vestry were all members of the 
metropolitan club as a symbol of power my guess is now maybe a 
quarter of them might be i consider that great progress said 
harper himself a member in good standing of the elite club 
harper prides himself on being nonpartisan 
he ascribes to some advice a friend once gave him 
its fine to be called the church of the presidents the 
friend counseled but be sure that youre never known as the 
church of the president

change comes slowly to this old south town 
of stately mansions and confederate flags on pickup trucks where 
dogwood blossoms and racially segregated high school proms are sure 
signs of spring 
there are no signs of racial division among the 760 students at 
modern redbrick eufala high school sixty percent are white but 
the president of the student body and president of the 180member 
senior class are black as are the basketball and football 
homecoming queens 
but when it comes time to don formal gowns and rented tuxedoes 
for the annual juniorsenior affair white students go to one 
dance blacks to another both are sponsored by private groups not 
the school itself 
i think were the only school in alabama that does this were 
the only one in america i hope said senior class president 
james samuel who is bound for the us air force academy after 
graduation 
they seem to think that if we go to dances together there 
will be racial flareups a fight said carmen campbell 18 a 
white senior and friend of samuel 
community leaders say the southeast alabama city of about 14000 
still has segregated proms even though the public school system was 
integrated 20 years ago after years of maintaining separate schools 
for blacks and whites 
superintendent dan parker said the school district got out of 
the dance business completely four years earlier but he denied 
race was the reason 
alcohol usually gets to be a problem said parker who has 
headed the 2900student system since 1978 they leave get 
drunk and then come back why should the board or teachers have to 
assume liability for that 
opponents of segregated proms claim the whitecontrolled school 
board uses worries over liquor and liability to dodge the issue of 
mixedrace dances 
the school system also refuses to sponsor homecoming dances and 
sockhops an rotc banquet planned for late may will be the first 
schoolsanctioned social event in about two decades officials said 
if the whites dont want to have a prom with the blacks you 
cant make them and vice versa said wd moorer a school board 
member since the 1950s i dont think its been a big issue but 
it might be now 
school board president billy houston called holding two proms 
a case of individual preference by the students 
eufaulas annual white prom is sponsored by a group called youth 
enterprises whose president marie houston is houstons daughter 
the whites dance is may 19 at lakepoint state park resort on 
the banks of lake eufaula the black prom put on by young blacks 
in action is may 26 at lakepoint 
a group of black parents last went before the school board about 
three years ago asking it to sponsor a joint prom but neither the 
board nor the administration took up the idea 
we have gone to the board of education the superintendent of 
education and the principal and they just give us the 
runaround said rose jordan of the local chapter of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people 
nearly all the seniors at a class meeting last fall cheered when 
samuel suggested holding a single prom miss campbell said 
wayne fiquett in his first year as principal at eufaula high 
school said he has talked with students and faculty about holding 
an integrated prom in 1991 several teachers were very willing 
to chaperone 
parker said student support for a joint schoolsponsored prom 
might not be enough to win the school boards approval 
the senior class might be 90 percent in favor of going to the 
bahamas too or abortion or all coming to school naked but that 
doesnt mean were going to do it he said children learn from 
experiences but the school system cannot provide all of lifes 
experiences

a newport newspapers inconspicuous list of 
divorces could become a test of a states right to bar public 
information from being reported by the news media 
the us supreme court has refused to say whether states can put 
offlimits otherwise public information by invoking privacy 
concerns and a newport divorce lawyer contends rhode islands 
privacy law is such a shield 
attorney thomas w kelly is suing the newport daily news on 
behalf of a woman who wants to keep her name out of the newspapers 
monthly listing of divorces granted in newport county family court 
the supreme court has opened the door for the first time 
said kelly citing its june 1989 ruling clearing the florida star 
newspaper after it published the name of a rape victim despite 
state law against such publication 
the paper was not not liable for invasion of privacy the high 
court ruled but said there might be a zone of personal privacy 
within which the state may protect the individual from intrusion by 
the press 
rhode islands 10yearold privacy law provides the right to be 
secure from unreasonable publicity of a fact which would be 
offensive or objectionable to a reasonable man of ordinary 
sensibilities 
kelly acknowledges his chances of winning are slim but argues 
his client is entitled to privacy because she is not a prominent 
figure and has not run for public office 
he wants the newspaper to discern the newsworthiness of the 
divorces it publishes a hearing on the case is set for monday 
when the court is expected to consider the newspapers motion to 
dismiss the lawsuit 
jane kirtley head of the reporters committee for the freedom of 
the press said the lawsuit is frivolous in open court she said 
the press role is to act as a surrogate for that portion of the 
public which cannot be there 
harvard university law professor alan dershowitz who defended 
newport socialite claus von bulow on charges he attempted to murder 
his wife said there is no possibility a state can bar 
publication of a public record 
the only way for the state to get around that is to say 
divorce is not a matter of public record but of course it is 
dershowitz said 
david b offer the newspapers editor said divorces are 
noteworthy regardless of the people involved because of their 
effects on the community its businesses schools churches and 
welfare programs 
some may call that voyeurism or scandal offer said but 
it seems to me that if divorces are of interest to a segment of 
the community that people have a right to read about them in a 
community newspaper 
kelly also contends divorce carries a social stigma an argument 
dismissed by sociologist frances goldscheider of brown university 
if 50 percent of marriages end in divorce it cant be much of a 
stigma anywhere she said 
eileen slocum of newports ritzy bellevue avenue said divorce 
is no more an issue in newport than elsewhere there are a few 
very wellknown people that really want no accessibility but there 
arent very many she said 
slocum said she scans the divorce listing like she does the 
obituaries because i hate to miss out on the death of a friend 
or a divorce 
the plaintiff identified as jane doe declined to be 
interviewed saying through kelly that she did not want to discuss 
her personal life the attorney said she is in her 20s was married 
less than 10 years and had no children 
a second woman who came forward after learning of the lawsuit is 
identified in a pending amended complaint as alison roe the 
30yearold works in the hotel business has no children and was 
married five years before her divorce 
roe agreed to be interviewed on condition her identity not be 
revealed she said she was harassed last december when her divorce 
appeared in the paper which also lists addresses and maiden names 
a man telephoned late that night and said hello alison i 
hear you got a divorce and made lewd remarks about her 
relationship with her former husband before she hung up roe said 
i wish i had a choice about keeping her name from appearing 
in the 16000circulation newspaper said roe its no ones 
business but my own

an indicted mayor and six challengers 
on tuesday face an electorate wearied by gamblings unkept promise 
to bring some luster to this touristdriven town 
the problems facing the winner are daunting and long festering 
racial polarization among the 35400 yearround residents crime 
and trashridden empty lots all dominated by a multibilliondollar 
casino industry that attracts 32 million visitors a year 
those saying they can solve the problems are mayor james l 
usry councilmen jim whelan and seth grossman former city council 
president hank tyner state assemblywoman dolores cooper and 
community activists john mcqueen jr and joseph polillo 
usry and whelan are expected to lead the field but the others 
could siphon off enough votes to force the issue into a runoff 
under the citys nonpartisan election system a candidate must 
garner more than 50 percent of the votes cast to win outright 
otherwise the two top candidates will face each other in a june 12 
runoff for the fulltime job that pays 72000 
bruce ransom executive director of the south jersey center for 
public affairs at stockton state college cautions that predictions 
in this election are difficult but he adds voting patterns in 
the city are generally done along racial lines 
the population is roughly 55 percent black 
ransom said usry the president of the national conference of 
black mayors who came to office in a special 1984 election and was 
reelected two years later should hang on to enough of the black 
vote from support generated in the churches some campaign 
literature for him has focused on fighting the white system 
usry 68 is the citys first black mayor he came to politics 
from the citys school system where he had served as an assistant 
superintendent since 1977 
whelan who is white should win much of the white vote and 
perhaps some black crossover with tyner the second black 
candidate appearing to gain strength in recent weeks and perhaps 
getting white crossover votes ransom said 
usry is the fourth of atlantic citys past six mayors to be 
indicted he was arrested last july and indicted 5 months later on 
charges he illegally accepted 6500 in bribes and illegal campaign 
contributions 
he is charged in two indictments with conspiracy official 
misconduct bribery gifts to public servants and violating the 
state campaign contribution law if convicted on all charges usry

interim president ion iliescu agreed 
to open talks with antigovernment protesters who took their 
demonstration for his resignation into its 14th day saturday 
as late as thursday vice premier gelu voicanvoiculescu 
dismissed the thousands of demonstrators as hooligans and ruled out 
dialogue but that position changed late friday during a meeting of 
iliescu vice president ion caramitru and other highranking 
officials 
the government said it will open talks with the protesters on 
tuesday morning but gave no further details 
the demonstration has gained momentum each evening since it 
began april 22 and has attracted crowds of up to 10000 it also 
has spread to at least two other major cities brasov and timisoara 
the number of hunger strikers vowing to fast until iliescu 
resigns climbed from 21 early this week to 57 increasing the 
pressure for talks 
the protesters charge that iliescu and fellow members of the 
national salvation front that dominates the government still harbor 
communist or totalitarian inclinations 
iliescu who took over as president after the december 
revolution that toppled communist dictator nicolae ceausescu 
nonetheless is considered the favorite in presidential elections 
may 20 
on friday night several hundred demonstrators in bucharest 
slept in 40 tents pitched in and around the downtown university 
square that has been the site of their 2weekold rally 
on saturday crowds returned to the square again blocking the 
citys central traffic artery 
many protesters appeared skeptical that iliescu would accept 
their demand to exclude former highranking communists such as 
himself from national politics 
as a red iliescu will never agree to this said alexandru 
amariei a 23yearold student the dialogue will not be a 
dialogue but a monologue an attempt to talk us into leaving 
the square 
it is hard to anticipate the results of the dialogue but 
whatever the results we will not give up said a member of an 
independent league of students at bucharest polytechnic who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
at a news conference last week leaders of various groups who 
say they are coordinating the protest invited government leaders to 
talk in their headquarters near university square 
they also expressed fears the government would order police to 
clear the square if the rally went on as planned until the 
elections 
at a news conference saturday vice premier mihai draganescu 
said the demonstrators will not be repressed by riot police 
except in extreme cases 
draganescu who is in charge of organizing the may 20 elections 
announced that the result of the presidential vote will be 
published on may 22 and the results of parliamentary elections one 
day later 
he also said premier petre roman has invited former president 
jimmy carter and former west german chancellor willy brandt to be 
among the foreign observers 
there was no word on whether the invitations had been accepted 
in another development a bucharest court postponed until after 
the elections a hearing on the appeal of four former highranking 
communist officials who were convicted in february of complicity to 
genocide while serving under ceausescu they are appealing their 
life prison sentences 
they are former interior minister tudor postelnicu 59 former 
communist party central committee secretary emil bobu 62 former 
vice president manea manescu 74 and former politburo member ion 
dina 62

fears of unemployment inflation and fading 
political support are forcing soviet leaders to back away from 
radical polishstyle economic reforms in favor of changes in easier 
stages 
shock therapy is out of the question alexander yakovlev 
told western and soviet reporters friday it would be politically 
shortsighted and practically impossible 
we have to create some sort of cushion or pillow said 
yakovlev a top aide to president mikhail s gorbachev it should 
go in steps 
in a separate newspaper interview he said radical reforms could 
force 10 million people out of work if we went ahead mindlessly 
the newly created presidential council gorbachevs main 
advisory group is reviewing a proposed reform package to make sure 
it does not send inflation through the roof 
yakovlev said however that prices must rise enough to sop up 
an estimated 500 billion rubles 825 billion at the official 
exchange rate soviet citizens have stashed because there are few 
consumer goods to buy 
it was unclear how many changes the leadership would make in the 
17point reform program part of which was leaked in march among 
the provisions were laws and executive orders to sell some 
government enterprises allow stock transactions and turn the ruble 
into a convertible currency 
gorbachev called in march for a normal fullfledged market 
and has said a new reform package would be announced at a session 
of the supreme soviet parliament that begins may 14 
during a recent trip to sverdlovsk in the ural mountains 
gorbachev encountered citizen arguments that the economy had 
worsened and further reforms would plunge it into an abyss 
speakers and demonstrators at the may day parade tuesday in 
moscow also expressed serious concern over the effects of proposed 
reforms 
despite all this the communist partys radical wing appears to 
be gaining strength on a platform of speedier reform yakovlev told 
the newspaper moskovsky komsomolets generally in the course of 
this year we must prepare conditions for a market economy 
in december kremlin leaders balked at radical economic reforms 
proposed by deputy premier leonid abalkin 
since then they have witnessed success in neighboring poland 
the solidarity government of prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
raised prices in stages over six months then went to a free market 
at the new year 
despite initial shocks production of consumer goods appears to 
have increased the currency has stabilized and solidarity has 
stayed in power 
in moscow stanislav shatalin of the presidential council said 
the ussr is not poland we are not one nation united under 
one church and the colossal authority of the pope in rome 
the soviet union consists of 15 republics whose economic 
conditions range from relative wellbeing in europe to widespread 
poverty and unemployment in central asia 
unlike poland our government does not have a credit of trust 
and so forth said shatalin an economist on the council created 
in march 
a prominent radical vasily selyunin contended further delay 
would harm the country 
we are postponing formation of a government of national trust 
and tomorrow might be too late he wrote in the may 2 edition of 
the literary gazette his article appeared next to one by shatalin 
much of the public distrust manifested in the angry slogans at 
the may day parade stems from economic deterioration under halfway 
measures that have left the country between central planning and a 
westernstyle market 
soviet and western economists seem to compete with each other to 
produce gloomy statistics 
industrial production fell 12 percent in the first quarter of 
1990 from the last quarter of 1989 according to soviet 
statisticians 
john l helgerson cia deputy director for intelligence told 
congress on april 20 soviet economic performance was abysmal in 
1989 the worst since gorbachev took over in 1985 even a 
modest economic recovery seems to us remote at best 
helgerson estimated soviet economic growth at 15 percent for 
1989 
in the economic debate last autumn radicals argued that making 
reforms was like crossing the grand canyon if not done in one 
leap it could be fatal 
as they approach the line again a senior western diplomat said 
he was told by a ranking soviet official if we jump and dont 
make it no one is going to make a precise measurement of how far 
we jumped

the united states is blocking the release 
of six american hostages in lebanon by trying to distance itself 
from any deals with iran over the fate of the captives tehran 
radio said saturday 
the radio said tehran had successfully negotiated with captors 
many times an apparent reference to the freeing of two american 
hostages last month by proiranian lebanese groups in the past two 
weeks 
in the end it is the policies of the western governments 
especially america which have blocked such efforts and not 
allowed all the hostages to return to the arms of their families 
said the radio monitored in nicosia 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani said thursday that american 
educators robert polhill 55 and frank reed 57 were released by 
their lebanese captors at irans bidding polhill had spent 39 
months in captivity reed 43 months 
most of the 16 western captives are believed held by proiranian 
shiite moslem groups 
the longestheld of the hostages in lebanon is terry anderson 
42 chief middle east correspondent for the associated press he 
was kidnapped in moslem west beirut on march 16 1985 
both iran and syria which also helped negotiate the hostage 
releases are thought seeking closer ties with the west to help 
rebuild flagging economies irans shattered by war 
rafsanjani branded the bush administration a stubborn 
frustrated child for refusing to make a goodwill gesture to iran 
following the two releases 
president bush has said he wont negotiate the captives 
release but on thursday he said he was trying to encourage the 
release of american hostages by helping iran determine the fate of 
four iranians who disappeared in lebanon in 1982 
if that is goodwill so be it bush said 
israel is holding 300 to 400 lebanese shiite prisoners 
including sheik abdul karim obeid a proiranian cleric abducted by 
israeli commandos in lebanon in july 1989 iran holds christian 
phalangist militiamen responsible for the disappearance of the four 
iranians last seen in beirut in 1982 
the radio made no mention of bushs offer 
saturdays tehran radio commentary said washington was torn 
between not wanting to be seen negotiating with iran and needing to 
restore relations with teharan 
the bush administration is engaged in antiiranian 
policies to distance itself from socalled negotiations or deal 
the state radio said it is clear that america needs to resume 
relations with iran which is a strong and strategic country in the 
middle east 
american actions its contradictory statements and hollow 
media statements either show washingtons confusion in adopting a 
correct stance to solve this crisis or it must be said the bush 
admnistration favors the hostage crisis to continue the radio 
said 
it said washington was trying to blame others for not releasing 
the hostages to ease public pressure which wants the government 
to provide the grounds for release of the other hostages the 
radio said 
in a related development a tehran newspaper on saturday 
criticized the british government for its handling of relations 
with iran 
the newspaper jomhuri islami which usually backs the 
antiwestern elements within the iranian government said british 
political leaders made no effort to explore the roots of the bad 
relations between london and tehran 
meanwhile in beirut the spiritual mentor of moslem militants 
holding western hostages said no more captives should be freed 
unless israel releases arab prisoners a newspaper reported 
saturday 
we want the states of the world to pressure israel into 
releasing arab prisoners the same way they exert pressure for the 
release of western hostages alanwar quoted sheik mohammed 
hussein fadlallah as telling a friday prayer sermon

president bush and congressional leaders are 
set to meet sunday for another budget summit and are again issuing 
warnings that such meetings are easy to stage while results are 
hard to produce 
we dont want to raise a lot of hopes that there are going to 
be any magic answers here said rep leon panetta dcalif 
chairman of the house budget committee who will not be on hand for 
the session 
government spending and taxing has been the product of 
highlevel negotiations between white house officials and the 
leaders of congress for the last three years 
but the budget deifict has drifted upward all the same and many 
in congress have soured on such sessions 
sundays meeting is already being portrayed as no more than a 
preliminary discussion of whether there is a will to hold more 
detailed budget talks later 
its a chance to discuss what the process will be where we go 
from here the presidents budget has been up there for some 
time on capitol hill white house spokesman steve hart said 
saturday weve expressed a willingness to have negotiations 
hart said the meeting in the white house residence quarters 
would be private between the president and the congressional 
leaders with possibly a few aides also on hand 
talking with bush will be house speaker thomas s foley 
dwash house minority leader robert michel rill senate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine and senate minority 
leader bob dole rkan 
the lowering of expectations is being done with good reason 
using toplevel negotiations to shape the governments 12 
trillion budget has proven a tricky path to follow 
results of the last two negotiated budgets have been spotty at 
best 
a november 1987 deal between congress and president reagan 
called for 30 billion in deficit reduction in fiscal 1988 and 46 
billion more in fiscal 1989 reagan hailed the pact as a good 
solid beginning to controlling the deficit 
the results were less dramatic in the end the 1988 deficit was 
155 billion 5 billion higher than the previous year the 1989 
shortfall dropped a bit to 152 billion 
in april 1989 highlevel talks involving the new bush 
administration yielded a deal for fiscal 1990 which runs until 
oct 1 the agreement was supposed to shrink the budget gap to 99 
billion but the nonpartisan congressional budget office expects 
this years shortfall to reach 159 billion 
when my wall street clients read about a 50 billion deficit 
reduction package they divide it by 10 said stanley collender 
who monitors the budget for price waterhouse the accounting firm 
what has gone wrong some of the savings the negotiators agreed 
to were premised on the economy running on a higher gear than it 
actually did the poorer economic performance meant lower tax 
collections for the government 
other savings never materialized because negotiators agreed to 
spending cuts and higher revenues that congress simply rejected 
that points to a hurdle faced by highlevel budget negotiators 
who agree to a deficitreduction package their next job is to get 
key committee chairpersons and a majority of members of the house 
and senate to go along and that is not easy when so many of 
congress natural power centers are left out of bargaining sessions 
to bind anybody youve got to have a broader group than 
those attending sundays meeting said rep silvio conte of 
massachusetts ranking republican on the house appropriations 
committee 
some legislators believe their political parties need to define 
their budget priorities clearly and that negotiated deals blur the 
distinction between democrats and republicans others flatly oppose 
all negotiated budget deals complaining that it leaves out 
lawmakers and entire committees that should be involved 
translation a budget pact worked out by the president and the 
leaders of congress still needs a majority of votes in the house 
and senate and some members votes do not come easily 
asked last week about the potential product of possible budget 
talks house appropriations committee chairman jamie whitten 
dmiss said im all for it provided its something i agree 
with

a bill guaranteeing the rights of disabled 
americans is heading for the house floor bolstered by a renewed 
strong display of white house support 
i look forward to signing a bill that will address the needs 
of our disabled citizens president bush said wednesday as the 
house judiciary committee approved the measure 322 
it was the fourth house panel to approve the americans with 
disabilities act and the lopsided vote was similar to those in 
other committees 
bushs statement however comes after an unsuccessful effort by 
his administration to amend the section of the bill dealing with 
sanctions against employers who discriminate white house 
spokeswoman alixe glen said the administration is weighing whether 
to press the issue on the house floor 
the battle over whether discrimination victims can sue for 
punitive or compensatory damages will still be fought in the debate 
over a major civil rights bill being considered by the education 
and labor committee 
i think the president is supportive of the bill and will sign 
the bill as it is now written said rep steny h hoyer dmd 
the chief house sponsor of the disabilities act there are 241 
cosponsors 37 of them republicans according to a list supplied by 
hoyer 
the bill extends civil rights protection to disabled people in 
employment public and private transportation public 
accommodations state and local government and telecommunications 
supporters say it represents a compromise with the white house 
and balances the needs of businesses with those of the disabled 
employment provisions are phased in over four years and businesses 
with fewer than 15 employees are exempt retrofitting and major 
renovations are not required 
business interests say they are satisfied with a number of the 
house amendments but would like further clarification of some 
provisions 
they also want tax relief to absorb the uncertain cost of 
accommodating disabled customers and employees as well as 
assurances that regulations are in place before enforcement is 
required 
hoyer said at a briefing on the bill last week that he believes 
it will be taken up the week of may 15 or may 22 
the senate passed the bill last september by a 768 vote 
attempts to amend the bill can be expected on the house floor 
the us chamber of commerce says it will fight for an amendment 
to have the employment provisions of the disabilities bill 
decoupled from the civil rights act of 1964 which covers 
minorities and women 
the pending civil rights act of 1990 would strengthen the 1964 
law one provision would allow jury trials in which punitive and 
compensatory damages may be sought against employers who allegedly 
discriminate 
thats your plaintiff lawyers wish list said frederick 
krebs a chamber official

the opposition labor party retained control of a 
london council that set the highest tax rate in the country under 
an unpopular new law according to final results saturday from 
britains local elections 
labor won a resounding victory over prime minister margaret 
thatchers conservatives in the nationwide balloting thursday 
the conservatives won 11 percent less of the popular vote than 
they captured in the 1987 general election 
however that was not as bad as the 20 percentage point loss 
predicted in opinion polls and some analysts said mrs thatcher 
was now more secure against possible challenges to her leadership 
nevertheless sir anthony meyer the conservative lawmaker who 
unsuccessfully challenged her in september said the results of the 
elections indicated it was time for a change at the top of the tory 
party 
millions of voters protesting soaring home mortgage loan rates 
and an unpopular new levy the socalled poll tax deserted the 
conservatives 
the tax which replaced a property levy paid only by homeowners 
is widely perceived as unfair because every adult in the same 
district pays the same rate irrespective of income 
despite setting britains highest poll tax nearly 940 per 
person laborcontrolled haringey council in north london was 
reelected saturday with three additional seats 
with results declared from all 201 councils contested labor 
gained 303 seats the conservatives lost 193 and the centrist 
social and liberal democratic party lost 49 
labor now controls 111 of the councils contested up from 97 
the conservatives had 51 down from 60 the centrists had 17 down 
two no party won a majority in the rest 
a computer analysis by the british broadcasting corp showed 
labor with 42 percent of the vote enough for a comfortable general 
election victory and the conservatives 31 percent the next 
general election must be held by june 1992

few things are unkempt in this chicago 
suburb of milliondollar homes but the slayings of a young couple 
have left a messy case marked by international intrigue and a 
bloody last goodbye 
a 20000 reward and a multistate police investigation have done 
little to solve the killings of richard and nancy langert whose 
bodies were discovered april 8 by her father in the basement of a 
townhouse he owned 
is it baffling yeah its baffling if you mean interesting 
said police lt joseph sumner who can see the roof of the 
townhouse from his office window but its not unsolvable 
police quickly ruled out robbery instead they are examining the 
couples business family and personal lives as well as a fourth 
area that they refuse to discuss the involvement of mrs 
langerts sister jeanne bishop in supporting human rights in 
northern ireland and defending an irish republican army member 
imprisoned in new york 
police are examining the couples finances and the possibility 
of a drug or other criminal link the family contends there is 
none friends and coworkers at gloria jeans coffee bean corp 
where the two worked say likewise 
if you were looking for best friends to have they were the 
kids that you would want to be best friends with said roger 
badesch spokesman for the arlington heightsbased chain of gourmet 
coffee stores theres just no way that they could be involved in 
anything that would warrant this 
langert 30 and mrs langert 25 had been staying at the 
townhouse for about six months while they prepared to move into 
their own home in another suburb on april 7 they went to dinner 
with nancys parents and ms bishop 
police say that one or more intruders were waiting when the 
couple returned home they were led into the basement richard was 
handcuffed and shot once in the back of the head 
mrs langert 2 months pregnant was shot through the elbow 
police said it was as she tried to escape she then was shot twice 
in the torso and bled to death at the foot of the stairs 
a neighbor reported hearing mrs langert say no not again 
followed by popping shots but said she thought it was the 
television mrs langerts father m lee bishop discovered the 
couple the next day 
mrs langerts purse was found on the first floor of the 
townhouse neither the 500 she had readied for bank deposit nor 
her credit cards were taken but her purse and wallet had been 
searched police said 
investigators also found the handcuffs a small bloody ax an 
article of clothing believed to belong to an offender and four 
slugs from a 38 or 357caliber magnum pistol 
on a piece of fallen shelving they found a message written by 
mrs langert in her own blood 
police say only that the message appears to have no 
significance the chicago tribune reported that it was a heart 
followed by a u an apparent goodbye message from the dying 
woman to her loved ones 
police refuse to say whose blood is on the ax or further 
identify the article of clothing but they have made three trips 
out of illinois to investigate three different angles in the 
killings including a trip to the east coast to examine ms 
bishops activism on behalf of prisoners in northern ireland which 
is racked by protestantvscatholic violence 
a local television station first reported quoting law 
enforcement sources that ms bishop was the target of an alleged 
death threat connected to her work in northern ireland 
ms bishop said the alleged threats were disclosed by law 
enforcement authorities to get her to divulge her contacts in 
northern ireland the fbi and police deny leaking the story but 
ms bishop has since stopped cooperating 
there have been four slayings in the history of this suburb of 
13000 about a halfhour north of chicago on lake michigan where 
the average home sold for 300000 to 400000 in 1988 
the most notorious was in 88 when a young woman laurie dann 
went on a shooting spree at a grade school killing an 8yearold 
boy and wounding several others before killing herself 
the langert killings and the rumors about ms bishops irish 
connection no longer dominate conversations police chief herbert 
timm said he feels no pressure from residents because the very 
complex mystery is still unsolved 
i think residents feel that its an isolated incident 
said tom king who lives in nearby morton grove and works a block 
from the townhouse i think if it had been a burglary and 
killing thered have been a lot more worry about it

the us military canceled offpost 
leaves saturday for american servicemen in the philippines after a 
marine was shot and killed outside the subic bay naval base 
apparently by communist rebels 
gunnery sgt john s fredette 34 of buena park calif was 
wounded late friday when five gunmen approached him in the 
nightclub district of olongapo 50 miles west of manila and shot 
him in the neck police said 
fredette who died an hour later was on temporary assignment to 
subic with marine fighterattack squadron 323 based at the marine 
air station in el toro calif 
no group claimed responsibility for the killing but police 
investigator romeo de guzman said it had all the earmarks of an 
assassination by communist rebels 
a philippine intelligence officer said on condition of anonymity 
two assailants were believed to be new peoples army guerrillas 
from orani in nearby bataan province and had received orders to 
liquidate americans 
philippine officials warned this month that the new peoples 
army was planning to kill an american before talks begin may 14 on 
extending the lease on six us bases in the philippines 
navy spokesman lt cmdr kevin mukri said the travel ban applied 
to the 40000 troops defense department civilians and military 
dependents at the six installations 
all nonessential offbase travel has been restricted at all 
the us facilities in the republic of the philippines mukri 
said in a statement broadcast by the far east network the military 
television station 
in manila us ambassador nicholas platt expressed his shock 
and sorrow at the cowardly murder 
the rebels have not traditionally operated in the olongapo area 
but they are strong near clark air base 50 miles north of manila 
if the rebels were responsible fredette would be the sixth 
american slain by guerrillas since army col james nick rowe 
was assassinated in suburban quezon city in april 1989 
two americans working for the us air force were killed last 
september on the day vice president dan quayle arrived in manila 
for an official visit 
and two american civilians were killed earlier this year in 
separate attacks on the islands of bohol and masbate in october 
1987 communist rebels gunned down three americans in simultaneous 
attacks outside clark 
concern about a possible rebel attack mounted after police 
arrested an alleged rebel assassin in olongapo earlier this month 
documents seized from the man dionisio bendoy indicated 
insurgents planned to kill americans in the city before the talks 
the united states maintains the subic base clark air base and 
four other smaller facilities under a 1947 pact that expires in 
september 1991 there is growing opposition in the philippines to 
the bases 
in another development the military said rebels killed at least 
14 people including a town mayor in attacks in the central and 
southern philippines since thursday 
six philippine army troopers and four government militiamen were 
killed thursday in san vicente a town in davao del norte province

mayor roger aguirre and two bodyguards during a dance in malay 
town about 200 miles southeast of manila the military also 
reported 
the communist new peoples army has waged a 21year insurgency

lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene 
said saturday that the soviet union ultimately will be forced to 
recognize an independent lithuania 
moscow will see that there is no other way because of the 
west mrs prunskiene told about 150 eager members of the 
lithuanian american youth association 
the prime minister cautioned the predominantly young crowd 
against assuming that once a declaration of independence is made 
like lithuanias proclamation on march 11 the battle is over 
rather the effort has just begun in trying to convince the west 
and moscow of lithuanias strong desire for democracy 
we yearn for a freedom and the west realizes it mrs 
prunskiene speaking in lithuanian told the group we alone have 
to convince other nations what our aspirations are 
the prime minister who has lobbied president bush 
administration officials and members of congress during a twoday 
crusade for lithuanian independence received a rousing welcome 
from the crowd at a capitol hill hotel 
hoots and hollers punctuated the applause as the prime minister 
arrived and chants of lithuania lithuania filled the room as 
mrs prunskiene departed a bouquet of flowers in her arms 
although mrs prunskiene was introduced to the crowd in 
lithuanian the phrase darling of washington was used in 
english to describe her and the reaction the prime minister has 
received since her arrival 
but in her speech the prime minister balked at the title 
it is not very good that i am considered a darling we must 
realize it is the process not the people she said 
the prime ministers session with bush failed to produce the 
assurances she sought but mrs prunskiene said she remains hopeful 
that she can convince western nations that embracing independence 
for lithuania will not undermine the reform effort by soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
mrs prunskiene was scheduled to meet with british prime 
minister margaret thatcher in london on tuesday and was expected to 
use the occasion to appeal once more for western guarantees of 
lithuanian sovereignty 
the prime minister said among her major concerns in lithuanias 
push toward democracy is the spring military conscription 
although she signed legislation ending the draft in lithuania 
mrs prunskiene said it was difficult to trust the common sense 
of the soviet union

pope john paul ii on sunday begins an 
eightday trip to mexico aimed at boosting the morale of his latin 
american flock and strengthening the church in the officially 
anticlerical country 
the pontiffs 47th foreign trip will take him to 10 mexican 
cities he plans to greet prosperous businessmen in durango 
slumdwellers outside mexico city and migrant workers in chihuahua 
and monterrey near the us border 
the pope is also scheduled to stop on the caribbean island of 
curacao before returning to rome on may 14 
john paul will emphasize a theme of his trip on sunday with the 
beatification of juan diego a mexican indian honored as the person 
to whom the virgin of guadalupe appeared in 1531 
the pope has made the virgin a symbol of his new 
evangelization campaign to strengthen the church in latin 
america the home of nearly half of the worlds 850 million 
catholics 
that program will be capped by a 1992 celebration of the 500th 
anniversary of the discovery of the americas 
ninety percent of mexicans are catholic 98 percent are 
guadalupanos said a vatican official referring to the wide 
devotion to the virgin 
using the 1992 anniversary as his banner the pope is trying to 
inject vigor into a latin church that is fast losing ground to 
evangelical sects in mexico the number of protestants grew more 
than 500 percent between 1950 and 1980 to 329 percent of the 
population according to mexican church figures 
john paul pressed the vatican to speed up the beatification 
process for juan diego so the indian could be honored in connection 
with the anniversary the vatican official said on condition of 
anonymity 
beatification is a step toward sainthood and means masses can be 
celebrated in the persons honor 
the beatification ceremony will also emphasize the churchs 
increasing efforts to appeal to the poor including indian groups 
in the past the church has been accused of joining the ruling 
class in repressing mexicos native population 
by elevating one of them juan diego the church 
demonstrates her option for the poor and makes us understand in an 
unequivocal way that all races and ethnic groups have the same 
human dignity the rev paolo molinari an official involved in 
the beatification process told vatican radio 
john paul will address the issue of indigenous groups in tuxtla 
gutierrez which has a large indian population thousands of 
guatemalan refugees are also expected for the ceremony in the city 
located near the guatemalan border 
during his visit the pope will likely speak about delicate 
topics he has raised in his previous nine trips to latin america 
including the foreign debt workers rights and birth control 
but his speeches could be particularly controversial in mexico 
which has some of the strictest anticlerical laws outside the 
communist world 
according to the mexican constitution written in 1917 after 
years of revolutionary upheaval the church does not legally exist 
and cannot own property priests are forbidden to speak about 
politics from the pulpit or to wear clerical garb outside churches 
these regulations have been routinely ignored or dodged in 
recent years and since the popes last trip in 1979 relations 
between the vatican and mexico have warmed considerably 
in a sign of the improvement mexican president carlos salinas 
de gortari named a personal envoy to the vatican last february the 
step is expected to lead to a resumption of diplomatic relations 
broken in the mid19th century 
the pope has said repeatedly his visit is pastoral not 
political 
however vatican officials say the pontiffs visit will 
strengthen the hand of local church leaders now pressing the 
government for more rights 
the popes prestige may also help the local church spread 
catholic teaching that opposes artificial birth control the 
mexican government has promoted the use of contraceptives to limit 
population growth to 1 percent by the turn of the century

an earthquake rocked southern italy on 
saturday and authorities said two elderly people died of heart 
attacks at least 19 people were injured and thousands of panicked 
residents ran from their homes 
the temblor centered in the poor mountainous region of 
basilicata knocked loose plaster and cornices from buildings when 
it struck at 921 am it measured 48 on the richter scale 
according to the national institute of geophysics in rome 185 
miles northwest of basilicata 
the epicenter was 95 miles southeast of naples the quake was 
felt as far south as the regions of calabria and puglia the toe 
and heel of the italian boot as well as in abruzzo a mountainous 
region in central italy 
parts of basilicata are still unrepaired from a quake in 
november 1980 that killed 3000 people and leveled thousands of 
buildings there and in the adjacent campania region around naples 
the prefects office in potenza regional capital of basilicata 
reported that a 68yearold man died of a heart attack and that 16 
people were injured including a young woman whose skull was 
fractured by a falling cornice 
later reports said a 69yearold woman in salerno province in 
campania suffered a fatal heart attack and three people in the 
region were injured 
the potenza prefects office said many of the injuries occurred 
as thousands of terrified residents fled their homes 
many of the people reportedly camped outside their homes as the 
area was rocked by numerous aftershocks at least three of them 
fairly strong 
train travel in calabria and campania was slowed so inspectors 
could check the tracks for possible damage 
fausto bubbico the mayor of one of the hardesthit towns 
brindisi di montagna said at least a dozen families were forced to 
evacuate their homes because of damage other towns reported cracks 
opening on main streets 
the national telephone company sip reported lines were tied up 
by calls to fire departments and other authorities it issued a 
statement asking people to limit their calls to emergency cases 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65

a gambling dispute 
among mohawk indians that flared into violence last week claiming 
two lives is the latest episode in a longsimmering feud over how 
to preserve their traditional way of life 
since at least the turn of the century mohawks have battled 
mohawks over how their nation should be governed 
the latest violence was triggered by the six casinos and bingo 
parlors that line the highway running through the american side of 
the reservation which also extends into canada 
in addition to the two killings more than 500 people fled the 
violence before state police moved in and sealed off the 
30000acre reservation called akwesasne by the mohawks as of 
saturday morning the standoff continued but things were quiet 
state police said 
the gambling palaces illegal under state law were bringing 
busloads of tourists hundreds of jobs and millions of dollars to 
the economically depressed reservation the money has financed 
large new houses for some that stand in sharp contrast to the 
cottages and trailer homes of other mohawks 
without the casinos this reservation wont be nothing said 
terry white who works as a blackjack dealer in tonys vegas 
international when the casinos are open 
but that runs up against the mohawks traditional lifestyle 
under traditional philosophies all forms of gambling are 
considered illegal and cannot be sanctioned said jim ransom a 
member of the elected tribal council 
traditional mohawks consider the reservation a sovereign nation 
governed by the 1000yearold iroquois great law of peace some 
live without electricity speaking only mohawk and sending their 
children to mohawk schools 
they have clashed in the past with other mohawks who want to 
administer the reservation as a municipality subject to state and 
federal laws and oppose the staterecognized elected council of 
the reservation 
in 1979 akwesasne traditionalists took over a st regis police 
headquarters to protest its ties to county sheriffs departments 
then barricaded themselves in an encampment for nearly a year 
state police intervened when mohawks supporting the reservation 
council formed an armed blockade around the encampment 
the tribal police were abolished in 1981 and there has been no 
local law enforcement on the american side of st regis since then 
in 1986 traditionalists protested against illegal taverns on 
the reservation after nine mohawks were killed in drunken driving 
accidents in three weeks one speakeasy burned to the ground and 
the others closed 
the confrontations have occasionally spread beyond the st regis 
borders 
in 1974 a group of traditionalist mohawks occupied an abandoned 
girls camp in the adirondacks in northcentral new york claiming 
it as their ancestral land after three years of negotiations with 
the state the mohawks agreed to move to land near the canadian 
border about 60 miles east of the st regis reservation this past 
march a national guard helicopter was struck by bullets fired from 
that enclave prompting an 11day armed standoff between mohawks 
and police 
in recent years the traditionalists have divided into two 
camps with the traditional chiefs on one side and the warrior 
society a selfappointed reservation security force on the other 
the chiefs accuse the warriors of provoking the recent violence 
and protecting the casino owners while the warriors say the chiefs 
are trying to take over the reservation undemocratically 
both sides agree that the heart of the dispute is not the 
casinos but who has the right to govern 
the question is how our aboriginal treaty rights are to be 
used said mike mitchell the antigambling chief of the elected 
canadian mohawk council they are not to be used to house casinos 
and illegal activities 
whether or not to allow gaming must be decided by all the people 
of the reservation said minnie garrow a warrior supporter 
they say were guntoting violent people but were going to 
go by the will of the people she said people just want their 
basic human rights to decide on the issue 
the violence has affected the mohawks neighbors in the nearby 
town of massena in quieter times people often drive through the 
reservation stopping to play bingo eat at the bears den 
restaurant or buy taxfree cigarettes 
but in recent weeks most townspeople have detoured around the 
reservation school buses have stopped entering mohawk land to pick 
up students and town officials canceled a sports meet that was to 
be held on the reservation 
the greatest tragedy said mitchell is the rift the dispute has 
sown among the mohawk people 
our whole culture is based on peace he said the violence 
is caused by outside influences 
many of the people he is fighting are his relatives and former 
friends mitchell said 
it will take many years to heal the wounds and shake hands 
again

a decision should be reached early this week 
on whether to make an additional 60 billion to 80 billion 
available for lending to eastern europe and third world countries 
the director of the international monetary fund said saturday 
at a news conference imf managing director michel camdessus 
said he was hoping for a higher amount than the 60 billion figure 
given last week by a treasury department official 
it will vary in a relatively narrow band between the 
significant and the rather substantial said camdessus 
predicting an agreement tuesday on the amount 
he accepted a reporters suggestion that significant meant 
an increase of 50 percent in the funds resources and rather 
substantial could be as high as 70 percent 
the treasury official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
12 billion of the 60 billion would come from the united states 
making it the top contributor other lead contributors are britain 
france japan and west germany 
the funds present resources theoretically total about 120 
billion worth of many kinds of money but much of it is in third 
world currencies that are little wanted by borrowers 
representatives of the 152 governments in the fund and its 
sister organization the world bank began a series of semiannual 
meetings at their washington headquarters on friday they will 
continue until tuesday 
camdessus praised polands new noncommunist leadership for what 
he called its headon approach in shifting toward a market economy 
instead of moving more gradually 
this has worked he said 
he pointed out that the zloty polands currency has been so 
stable that there has been no need to use the international 
stabilization fund set up to support it 
the fund and bank are supporting poland with loans which now 
amount to more than 11 billion

the contra rebels agreed saturday to 
start laying down their arms this week after the newly elected 
government promised to begin reducing the size of the 
sandinistacontrolled armed forces 
the agreement a major victory for new president violeta barrios 
de chamorro could signal an end to nearly a decade of civil war in 
nicaragua 
only two days ago the usbacked contras had insisted the 
sandinista army must be dismantled at the same time as the rebels 
a demand the chamorro government rejected as dangerous to 
nicaraguas fragile peace 
the accord was the result of more than 15 hours of talks 
involving rebel leaders mrs chamorro cabinet members and 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo that ended early in the morning 
unlike earlier agreements the accord was signed by a top rebel 
commander israel galeano 
the socalled declaration of managua calls for the 12000man 
rebel army to begin laying down their arms tuesday they are to be 
fully disarmed by june 10 
mrs chamorro promised to order a reduction in the size of the 
armed forces estimated to number 300000 and the disarming of 
thousands of civilians in zones where the contras are to begin 
demobilizing 
the sandinistas gave their supporters thousands of weapons 
between the time they lost the feb 25 elections and when mrs 
chamorro took office in april 
the president who also serves as defense minister did not say 
how deep the cuts in the military would be 
on june 10 we will announce the program of the reduction of 
the armed forces ordered in my inaugural address of april 25th 
and whose implementation should begin immediately mrs chamorro 
said 
the accord also said the security of the rebels and their 
families camped with them would be guaranteed and that they would 
be given humanitarian assistance 
i hope that the insurgent troops understand that there are 
reforms under way to construct and fortify a true democracy 
galeano said 
he said he was considering forming a peasant organization one 
must look at the climate and look for a way to contribute to erase 
the climate of social distrust created by the repression that 
existed here he said 
galeano did not say what prompted his decision to sign the 
accord he and other contra leaders had been angered by mrs 
chamorros decision to retain gen humberto ortega as head of the 
army 
ortega brother of former president daniel ortega was defense 
minister in the sandinista government and a member of the partys 
nineman national directorate he and other sandinistas in the 
military resigned their political posts after the election as part 
of a transition agreement with mrs chamorro 
most of the contra army estimated at between 9000 and 12000 
fighters has returned to nicaragua from honduran base camps in the 
past few months many are in security zones supervised by un 
peacekeepers 
the contras first pledged to turn in their weapons by june 10 in 
an accord they reached with mrs chamorros government on april 19 
but that agreement soon began to unravel in a dispute over gen 
ortegas position and the size of the army the sandinista leader 
still controls 
saturdays agreement essentially salvaged the april 19 accord

west germany is tempting the soviet 
union to drop objections to a unified germanys membership in nato 
with its mightiest weapon the powerful deutsche mark 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze has rejected the 
western allies demand that a united germamy belong to nato 
but west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher said 
bonn was ready to offer broad economic cooperation with moscow to 
clear the military obstacle from the path to german unity 
chancellor helmut kohl made a similar offer although both men 
shied away from specifics increased trade ties are considered the 
strongest possibility 
kohl spokesman hans klein speaking on the eve of the talks 
said bonn was interested in an expansion of germansoviet 
relations especially economic cooperation 
with the soviet economy collapsing amid ethnic unrest 
inefficiency and the disintegration of the sovietled economic 
alliance comecon the prospect of economic aid could lessen the 
military loss of east germany to nato 
money can help but the question is also of a psychopolitical 
nature of how the soviets can keep face said ingo kolboom an 
expert on international affairs at the respected german society for 
foreign policy 
indeed the soviets appeared indignant at suggestions they would 
be willing to sacrifice security interests for western economic 
assistance 
we are not selling any political concern of our country its 
not a sale soviet foreign ministry spokesman vitaly churkin said 
as shevardnadze met with us secretary of state james a baker iii 
on friday 
but the west german offer came as soviet trade ties have been 
badly buffeted by revolutions in eastern european nations which 
now are more interested in developing trade links with the west 
unification will bring further changes as east germany the 
soviet unions largest trading partner and key supplier of 
technology industrial components and consumer goods merges with 
west germany 
while west germany has already pledged to take over east 
germanys trade obligations with the soviet union many agreements 
between east berlin and moscow expire in 1990 and are not expected 
to be renewed 
but bonn has a number of options to help rescue the soviet 
economy 
west german banks hold part of the soviet unions estimated 50 
billion foreign debt and could play an important role in 
restructuring payments which now eat up about 25 percent of soviet 
export earnings 
west germany has already stepped up food aid to the soviet union 
and could increase such exports bonn also could lobby western 
allies to cut restrictions on hightechnology exports to the soviet 
union 
in addition bonn could expand credit guarantees for west german 
companies interested in setting up joint ventures with soviet 
partners financial guarantees could be important if the soviet 
union tries to make the ruble partially convertibile 
it is also likely bonn will take over subsidies east berlin pays 
the 380000 soviet troops and 120000 dependents stationed in east 
germany equal to about 700 million east marks last year west 
german press reports have said the soviets might demand that sum be 
paid in convertible currency meaning a tidy profit for moscow

indian troops shot and killed nine people 
who tried to cross from the pakistan side of the frontier to 
indiangoverned kashmir on saturday including five armed moslem 
militants official sources said 
the most serious clash occurred near the jhelum river 45 miles 
west of srinagar the center of the kashmir secessionist movement 
the sources said 
the indian border force killed five armed moslem militants and 
captured three others in a clash about 3 am according to the 
sources an indian guard and a doctor serving with the border force 
also were killed in the clash 
in other encounters along the frontier on saturday indian 
forces shot and killed four men who tried to enter indiangoverned 
kashmir at different places according to the sources who cannot 
be identified under brefing regulations 
they said one of the four was a militant but the other three 
were unarmed and they did not know if they also were militants 
it was the second day in a row that indian officials reported a 
clash along the disputed frontier indian troops killed seven 
kashmiri militants on friday in another sector of the confrontation 
line between india and pakistan 
the islamic militants want predominantly moslem kashmir to 
secede from mostly hindu india 
india accuses pakistanwhich is overwhelmingly moslem of 
harboring and arming the separatists pakistan says it supports 
kashmiri moslems right to selfdetermination but denies sheltering 
or arming them 
the two countries went to war over kashmir in 1948 and 1965 
both sides say they do not want another war but the current 
kashmir crisis has heightened their traditional distrust and 
animosity 
at least 337 people have died in kashmir since jan 20 when 
indian launched its harshest crackdown to date on the increasingly 
violent separatist movement the majority were moslem militants or 
supporters shot by indian troops while defying curfew or staging 
antiindia demonstrations 
both india and pakistan have claimed kashmir since the two 
nations were partitioned along religious lines when they won their 
independence from britain in 1947 the old princely state of 
kashmir had a moslem majority but its ruler was a hindu and he 
opted to join india

an african national congress 
leader received a standing ovation saturday when he told a mostly 
white university that fullscale negotiations on ending white rule 
probably would begin soon 
the ancs thabo mbeki said three days of talks between his 
organization and the government had dramatically improved the 
climate for negotiatons on a new constitution to include the 
countrys 28million black majority 
it would be reasonable to make the assumption that we are not 
very far from a process of constitutional negotiation which would 
involve all parties mbeki told a predominantly white audience of 
1000 at stellenbosch university outside cape town 
the anc and the government wrapped up three days of discussions 
friday and agreed for the first time to work together toward 
removing obstacles to constitutional negotiations 
the anc is very committed to creating a political system in 
this country which is color blind said mbeki head of the ancs 
foreign affairs department we have a history defined too much by 
color too much by race 
mbeki who has spent 27 years in exile received a standing 
ovation and sustained applause for his remarks 
stellenbosch is considered the countrys most prestigious 
university for afrikaners the dutchdescended settlers of south 
africa who comprise 3 million of the countrys 5 million whites 
many of the countrys leaders attended the university 
also saturday a newspaper reported that former president pw 
botha dissatisfied with the changing policies of the government 
has withdrawn from the ruling national party that he served for 
more than 50 years 
the afrikaanslanguage newspaper rapport said botha who 
resigned last august after 11 years in power was upset with the 
wideranging reforms introduced by his successor fw de klerk 
botha declined to renew his party membership when it expired 
recently rapport said 
talks between the anc and the government have won wide support 
but a militant black group predicted there could be pitfalls ahead 
i dont see how the anc and the government can share power 
said zeph mothopeng president of the pan africanist congress 
negotiations can only take place after an election that 
includes the black majority mothopeng told a johannesburg news 
conference 
the pan africanists say the only matters they will negotiate are 
the direct transfer of power from whites to blacks and the transfer 
of whiteowned land to blacks the pan africanists split with the 
anc in 1959 over tactical issues and the two antiapartheid groups 
remain rivals to this day 
another anc rival the relatively conservative inkatha movement 
accused mbeki of promoting black divisions in the strifetorn 
southeastern province of natal 
in remarks thursday mbeki suggested that mangosuthu buthelezi 
leader of inkatha and head of the zulu homeland should sit with 
the whiteled government rather than with black antiapartheid 
groups in any constitutional negotiations 
this kind of rhetoric from the thabo mbekis of this world 
fans the flames of the very violence they claim to be concerned 
about buthelezi said it is not mr mbeki who will decide 
where i will sit 
about 4000 blacks have died in natal since 1986 in fighting 
between anc supporters and inkatha 
anc deputy president nelson mandela and de klerk appearing at a 
joint news conference friday said the preliminary discussions were 
an important step toward normalizing political activity and sharing 
power 
both sides said they would establish a working group to 
resolve obstacles to full constitutional negotiations de klerk 
said no agreement had been reached on further talks but the 
working group would report by may 21 and both sides hoped for swift 
progress 
the joint statement stressed the need to end political violence 
that claimed hundreds of lives in recent months also the 
government pledged to work toward lifting the state of 
emergency a key anc demand 
asked about the government demand the anc renounce its armed 
struggle mandela said the anc will therefore look into the 
question of the armed struggle and take appropriate decisions 
in london archbishop desmond tutu on saturday described the 
talks as epoch making shortly before flying to the united 
states tutu pointed to a front page newspaper picture of mandela 
and de klerk sitting side by side and smiling 
it is incredible when one looks at that picture one realizes 
that it really is epoch making tutu said at londons heathrow 
airport

the more the house delays making a decision on 
rep barney frank the more potential problems it creates for 
everyone involved 
for frank a liberal democrat from massachusetts the longer the 
investigation into his relationship with male prostitute stephen 
gobie drags on the more it becomes entwined in his reelection bid 
this fall 
for the ethics committee the continuing disagreement threatens 
to erode the panels carefully nurtured reputation for 
nonpartisanship 
for house democrats an inevitable vote on the frank case will 
put them on record as either abandoning a party colleague or 
appearing to condone what frank himself admits was bad judgment 
even republicans who might expect to gain from franks troubles 
might be wary lest house members of both parties start to find 
their personal lives going under the investigative microscope 
frank has already announced his bid for a sixth term despite a 
deadlock in the ethics committees eightmonth investigation 
the slow progress prompted him to abandon his plan to await a 
verdict before announcing whether he would seek reelection 
there is no time limit on the ethics committee and every week of 
delay brings it closer to the election 
at least one conservative republican is hoping the case is 
resolved in time to get democrats on the record before elections 
rep william e dannemeyer rcalif has promised to seek a 
floor vote on expelling frank from the house once the ethics 
committee completes its work 
he wants to force democrats to choose between antihomosexual 
sentiments among the voters and loyalty to a colleague who has 
ensnared himself in an unpopular ethics case 
a democratic incumbent who votes against a tougher penalty 
will have to answer whether that sort of behavior would be 
tolerated locally said gary koops of the national republican 
campaign committee koops said republican strategists have no plans 
to make the frank case a national political litmus test rather he 
said its a district by district issue 
republicans will fail if they try to pin barney franks problems 
on other democrats according to democratic congressional campaign 
committee spokesman howard schloss 
republicans tried to use former house speaker jim wrights 
troubles at elections in some 30 congressional districts and failed 
to do any political damage schloss said 
it just doesnt work schloss said thats not why people 
vote for members 
when the closeddoor ethics committee deliberations broke down 
last week eight months into the investigation initial 
speculation held that republican members were insisting on a tough 
penalty in hopes of forcing a floor vote 
committee members who insisted on anonymity said however that 
much of the dispute within the panel concerned upholding its 
reputation as a bipartisan body whose recommendations 
traditionally have been unanimous 
the ethics panel is different from other house committees which 
are controlled by majority democrats because its membership is 
evenly divided between the two parties 
the committee members also said there is no unanimity among 
precedentconscious lawmakers on how to address the question of an 
individual congressmans sexual conduct 
any committee decision is likely to address the question of 
whether it is tolerable for a member of congress to hire a 
prostitute 
the case focuses on franks admission that he paid gobie 80 to 
have sexual relations with him in 1985 and that he hired gobie as a 
personal assistant and chauffeur 
it also centers on the charges by gobie that he operated a 
prostitution ring out of franks capitol hill apartment with the 
congressmans knowledge that the two had sexual relatons in the 
house gymnasium and that frank invoked congressional privilege to 
waive parking tickets incurred by gobie while using franks car 
particulars of the frank case seem unusual enough that they 
might not produce a precedent applicable in many future 
controversies but some ruling by the house on the question of 
prostitution seems all but guaranteed

a house committee chairman charged on saturday 
that the manufacturer of the navys new 12 billion guidedmissile 
destroyer is hampering congressional investigators examining 
allegations of contract fraud 
rep john dingell dmich said the bath iron works of bath 
maine has refused to provide the congressional general accounting 
office with documents or allow investigators to interview employees 
unless the gao promises to withhold the information from congress 
dingell in a letter to defense secretary dick cheney said it 
was time the navy got tough with the contractor 
the navy appears to be coddling bath rather than protecting 
the publics interest dingell wrote 
a copy of the fourpage letter dated may 2 was obtained by the 
associated press 
a spokesman for bath iron works said saturday the company has 
cooperated with the gao and the defense contract audit agency 
which are looking into the allegations by dingell and those made 
anonymously through a whistleblowers hotline 
mr dingells letter contains no new allegations that weve 
heard about said jim mcgregor the companys spokesman 
dingell the chairman of the house energy and commerce 
subcommittee on oversight and investigations has been highly 
critical of the navys plans to buy 33 of the ddg51 destroyers at 
a cost of about 30 billion 
dingell has questioned the survivability of the ship and its 
sophisticated aegis weapons system against missile attack and 
alleged that the navys contract with bath is a procurement 
nightmare of fraud and abuse 
the destroyer called the arleigh burke class after the world 
war ii naval hero and former chief of naval operations is designed 
with an allsteel superstructure and will be equipped with tomahawk 
cruise missiles 
the pentagon as part of its budgetcutting efforts and 
rethinking of the soviet threat to the west may scale back the 
program 
in his letter to cheney dingell said bath had violated the 
pentagon regulation that all contractor employees fill out their 
time cards in ink to avoid supervisors directing them to mischarge 
none of the yard workers at bath iron works fill out their own 
time cards they are filled out by their supervisors who also have 
responsibility for the budgets dingell said 
this is an outrage it violates every principle of 
responsible internal controls and makes it virtually impossible to 
audit for mischarging he said 
the defense contract audit agency in an effort to prevent 
mischarging conducts surprise floor checks in which investigators 
question employees on what they are working on and compare that to 
the job they are charging their time 
according to dingell however the navy and bath iron works 
reached an agreement that required the dcaa to give the company 
24hour notice before a floor check 
dingell said that despite the limitation investigators found an 
employee who submitted two time cards both of which were accepted 
by the company a parttime employee who recorded 40 hours of work 
although he only worked 25 hours and an employee who charged his 
time to a costreimbursable contract when he admitted to 
investigators he worked on a fixedprice contract 
the preliminary dcaa audits have indicated that there is 
substance to virtually all of the anonymous allegations of 
mischarging and defective pricing dingell said 
bath spokesman mcgregor disputed the congressmans claims 
bath iron works never intentionally mischarged anything on any 
of its contracts with the navy he said

the game a milliondollar telephone 
trivia quiz promoted as a direct line to the american dream may 
violate interstate gambling laws a tennessee congressman says 
participants in the game scheduled to start monday either 
lose the 299 cost of calling the 900prefix telephone number or 
win prizes ranging from 5 to 1 million says rep bart gordon 
participants in this game are effectively betting 299 that 
they will win money much as participants in a lottery pay for the 
chance to win cash gordon said friday calling for a federal 
investigation into the contest 
only one of every 100 participants wins even the 5 prize 
he said 
in the game produced by the los angelesbased 900 million 
productions contestants call in and compete with as many as nine 
other callers to be the first to answer a trivia question 
the winner gets a tollfree number to call to compete with other 
firstround winners for a 5 prize second round winners proceed to 
a third round with 100 prizes 
the winner of seven rounds is supposed to win 1 million which 
gives contestants odds of one in 10 million said kent syler a 
spokesman for the democrat 
gordon sent a letter to attorney general dick thornburgh on 
friday asking for an investigation into whether the game requires 
skill or dumb luck said kent syler administrative assistant for 
gordon 
syler said the only skill required by the game would be the 
dexterity of contestants fingers in pressing the numbers on the 
telephone 
it is at best borderline gambling syler said i cant 
think of another opportunity a person has to pay a fee and win some 
money 
not so said rhonda brauer of hill and knowlton inc in los 
angeles who is handling public relations for the game 
its definitely a game of skill and knowledge and speed 
she said it is not a game of chance 
she did say the questions are based on common knowledge you 
have to be knowledgeable about things in the united states like how 
many keys are there on a piano she said there are 88 keys 
the game was developed by allen koss who produced such 
television game shows as tic tac dough concentration and 
the jokers wild 
while contestants can play the game at any time may 20 is 
the first date the company will give away the milliondollar prize 
officials say and other millionaires will be made every second 
sunday thereafter 
only in america is it possible to win 1 million from the 
privacy of home said lynn folse vice president of 900 million 
productions for the first time people can use their touchtone 
phones for a direct line to the american dream

the four world war ii allies agreed 
saturday that german unification should go forward without delay 
and they shied away from imposing restraints on what will be 
europes most powerful nation 
the cold war is over our planet the world europe are now 
embarking on a new road soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze said after the nearly sevenhour meeting 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher read a 
declaration by the nations that set a timetable for further talks 
with a session in june in berlin in july in paris and in september 
in moscow 
it was the first toplevel unification session among the 
germanys and the allies the united states soviet union britain 
and france which split germany into two countries 45 years ago 
the diplomats also agreed to invite polish foreign minister 
krzysztof skubiszewski to the paris session when border issues 
will be discussed genscher said 
poland has expressed fears over possible german claims to 
territory that belonged to germany before world war ii and poland 
will have the right to address all related issues the declaration 
said 
us secretary of state james a baker iii appearing at a joint 
news conference with the other diplomats after the meeting 
emphasized that germans of the new nation should make their own 
decisions 
otherwise he said the allies would be planting seeds of 
future instability 
asked about such touchy issues as the size of a new german army 
and how close it might be deployed to poland and the soviet union 
he said ultimately the fundamental decision with respect to any 
nations military forces is going to be up to that nation 
genscher reiterated a pledge that the new nation would renounce 
nuclear chemical and biological weapons but he also rebuffed 
continued soviet objections to nato membership for a united 
germany the main sticking point in the talks 
shevardnadze repeated in statement friday that a solution was 
possible 
im optimistically inclined he said i think we shall 
succeed on all of these matters in finding mutually acceptable 
solutions that is the premise upon which we proceed 
are there any serious divergences i dont think we should 
dramatize this is normal around negotiations he said the 
soviet delegation the soviet leadership intend to work 
constructively in order to accelerate the vitally important 
historical process of building german unity 
a senior us official said during a briefing later however 
that during the meeting shevardnadze reiterated soviet opposition 
to nato membership 
the foreign minister said it would be difficult for the soviet 
people to accept and create an imbalance in europe said the us 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd told reporters the 
western allies did not want moscow to feel its security interests 
were being neglected 
however he added that at the end of the day its not of 
course for them the soviets to decide whether a united germany 
is a member of nato 
the meeting was held behind closed doors in the west german 
foreign ministry 
baker set the tone in a speech that said the work of the four 
powers should be limited to relinquishing their 45 years of control 
over berlin the old german capital 
we face the challenge of rising above the past he said in 
comments distributed to reporters before the meeting we engage 
in an act of reconciliation of a people too long separated of a 
continent too long divided 
according to a british official who briefed reporters on the 
condition of anonymity shevardnadze accepted entirely the 
selfdetermination of the german people 
neither shevardnadze nor baker dwelled on germanys nazi past 
we dont want a discussion on obsolete views the british 
official quoted shevardnadze as saying 
genscher emphasized in his opening remarks that there were 
difficult problems to solve if we are all willing not only 
to defend our own interests but also to respect the interests of 
our partners then we will find solutions 
he cited the helsinki final act regulating relations among 
european countries in his rebuff of moscows stance against a 
unified germany joining nato 
the final act emphasizes quite distinctly that all principles 
are of primary significance genscher said in this connection 
i refer to the principle of sovereign equality which gives all 
participating states the right to be or not to be a party to 
treaties of alliance 
since we know that the western alliance adapting itself as it 
does to the changes in europe brings about peace and security a 
freestanding united germany would be of no benefit to europe he 
added 
the soviets have called for a neutral germany while 
shevardnadze was quoted last month as favoring a nonaligned 
germany 
baker acknowledged that other nations have legitimate 
interests that may need to be addressed a reference to the 
soviet union which lost more than 20 million people to the nazi 
invaders 
baker said the new germany should not extend beyond the borders 
of what are now east germany west germany and berlin 
genscher has said a united germany will be in nato but he also 
has offered to let the soviets keep some of their troops in what is 
now east germany for a transitional period 
about 250000 us troops are stationed in west germany with an 
estimated 380000 soviet troops in east germany

governments and bankers are finding a new goal 
for lending billions of dollars internationally every year the 
promotion of democracy 
this is a sharp departure the traditional political neutrality 
of banks although that tradition is gradually being honored more 
in the breach than in the observance 
the world bank whose largest stockholder is the united states 
has not made loans in recent years to nicaragua or vietnam after 
the bloody chinese suppression last year of student demonstrators 
the united states arranged for 720 million in world bank loans to 
be suspended 
of the 152 governments that own the world bank and international 
monetary fund 30 of them will be owners of the new european bank 
for reconstruction and development 
the united states will be the largest single stockholder in the 
new 12 billion bank when arrangements are completed that is 
expected to happen may 30 in paris 
the purpose of the bank shall be to promote private and 
entrepreneurial initiative in the central and eastern european 
countries committed to and applying the principles of multiparty 
democracy pluralism and market economics says the first of its 
articles of agreement 
that is a long journey from the ancient roman proverb money 
has no smell and the world banks own articles of agreement say 
the bank and its officers shall not interfere in the political 
affairs of any member nor shall they be influenced in their 
decisions by the political character of the member or members 
concerned 
members of the world bank do include both communist and 
noncommunist governments the world bank estimates total lending 
to third world countries at 13 trillion some of the leaders of 
those countries are communists others are authoritarians with 
other ideologies 
and there appear to be limits to how far the bank will go in 
rewarding ideology 
world bank president barber conable an american took issue 
with a statement last week by herman cohen assistant secretary of 
state for africa cohen predicted that in the nottoodistant 
future the united states will make progress toward democracy a 
condition for aid 
i dont know what mr cohen may have meant when he said that 
political conditionality was a desirable force conable said 
we obviously respect democracy and support it but so far as 
our development work is concerned its based on economic 
criteria

the reputed no 3 man in colombias cali drug 
cartel and an associate pleaded guilty to federal drug charges two 
weeks into their trial after a defense attorney concluded the 
government had an unbeatable case 
luis santacruz echeverri accused of handling the us end of 
shipments pleaded guilty to 49 counts guillermo penagos 
reputedly his top lieutenant admitted to 30 charges court 
officials said friday 
jose quinon santacruzs attorney said he advised his client to 
make the plea after details of the governments case came out it 
was an unbeatable case very well put together quinon said 
in exchange for the pleas the government agreed to drop the 
most serious count operating a continuing criminal enterprise 
which carryies a mandatory life prison sentence 
as it is the charges they pleaded to thursday carry a minimum 
term of 10 years and a maximum of life imprisonment their trial 
had been expected to last another month 
echeverris as big an active doper as weve ever gotten 
said assistant us attorney howard vick jr this disrupts their 
us operation 
john fernandes spokesman for the drug enforcement 
administration said echeverris a mover and shaker and he is 
very trusted in south america you dont easily replace him 
the case against santacruz blossomed with the seizure of 2 tons 
of cocaine at a chicago produce market the colombian cocaine had 
arrived in miami aboard a honduran freighter and had been trucked 
to the chicago warehouse 
hotel and airline records placed santacruz and penagos in 
chicago when the cocaine arrived signaling that leaders of 
colombias lesser known cartel were overseeing shipments personally 
santacruz who has had homes in miami since 1983 was known to 
the dea as the us coordinator of the cartels smuggling 
operations federal agents say his halfbrother jose santacruz 
londono is coleader of the cartel based in cali colombia 
luis santacruz was arraigned behind bars last july at the 
federal metropolitan correctional center southwest of miami because 
of fears that fellow traffickers would try to either kidnap or 
assassinate him 
the trial was before us district judge william hoeveler who 
also is handling the drug trial of deposed panamanian ruler manuel

thousands of czechs joined us 
veterans saturday for a sunkissed streetfest in the first 
celebration ever of the liberation of this beerbrewing city by 
american troops in world war ii 
pubs were turned into imitations of wild west saloons and 
youths with american army paraphernalia rode the streets on vintage 
harleydavidson motorcycles inherited from their parents 
up to 150000 visitors were expected to descend on pilsen a 
city of 130000 on sunday when president vaclav havel and us 
ambassador shirley temple black were to preside over the close of 
the twoday celebration 
gen george c pattons 3rd army liberated pilsen on may 6 
1945 just three days before world war ii ended in prague 
by agreement with the soviets american troops came to a halt at 
the demarcation line cutting southwest through czech territory 
leaving the red army to conquer the czechoslovak capital 
boy everybody wanted to go on to prague and get it over 
with said cpl ross johnston 75 an attorney from zanesville 
ohio but we had to stop here wait for two weeks and then we 
were pulled out 
the communists barred any commemoration of the us liberation 
of about 3600 miles of czechoslovak territory and marked may 5 as 
a day of liberation by soviet troops 
six months after czechoslovakias peaceful revolution in 
december however the atmosphere in this grim industrial city had 
changed remarkably 
american flags adorned the former bastions of communist 
officials and scores of us veterans were in town for the 
celebration 
tens of thousands of people turned out saturday morning to see 
the ceremonial inauguration of a monument to the 2nd infantry 
divison on pilsens downtown republic square 
those who lived long enough to see the return of pattons men 
still remember the postwar atmosphere 
it felt so right that our town was freed from the nazis by a 
western army frantisek kotva a pensioner mused over a mug of 
the citys famous beer 
we all loved the gis but then we had to forget about them for 
a long time he said alluding to the four decades of communist 
suppression that followed 
elsewhere in czechoslovakia the occasion was marked with 
quieter ceremonies 
ambassador temple black joined jan urban the leader of the 
civic forum movement that led the revolution against the 
communists at the unveiling of a memorial to the us army in 
vitejovice about 70 miles southwest of prague 
a similar plaque was unveiled in the nearby town of chodov in 
lipnik and bevcou crowds gathered to remember martin zeberski a 
us pilot killed there in august 1944 
havel and temple black will lead sundays festivities in pilsen 
which were to begin with a morning ceremony at the demarcation line 
and end with a country ball 
ive been to several similar events but this is much bigger 
than any of us expected johnston said 
if the very president of the united states came here in 
person he could not be shown more courtesy and respect than we 
were

west german president richard von 
weizsaecker went sightseeing saturday the last day of his 
unprecedented visit designed to calm polish fears about german 
unification 
during four days of official meetings and informal visits 
weizsaecker repeatedly assured poles that a united germany would 
respect polands borders and wants to contribute to an integrated 
europe not dominate it 
adam michnik a leading polish thinker wrote in saturdays 
prosolidarity gazeta wyborcza that the weizsaecker visit the 
first to poland by a west german head of state will bring a new 
perspective to bilateral ties 
a lot depends on polishgerman relations especially stability 
in the heart of europe michnik said it is not enough to be 
afraid of germans 
from this time on we must take up polishgerman problems at a 
different higher level he said 
weizsaecker ended his visit sightseeing at the birthplace of the 
18th century german philosopher and writer gottfried herder in 
morag and at a museum for the astronomer copernicus in frombork 
he planned to return saturday to bonn where the foreign 
ministers of both germanys and the four victorious world war ii 
allies were holding talks on german unification 
poland has sought a role in the talks to press its security 
concerns especially the permanence of its postwar western border 
drawn along the oder and neisse rivers to include territory from 
defeated germany 
the rush toward german unification has been received with 
concern in poland where the prospect of a resurgent economic and 
political power next door stirs memories of germanys world war ii 
aggression 
the distance between our nations is diminishing but in order 
to eliminate it completely we should learn well the layers of 
distrust between us weizsaecker told students at gdansk 
university friday 
michnik wrote that poland as it struggles to transform its 
communist political and economic system can learn from the west 
german experience 
it is not enough to feed ones conscience with the memory of 
martyrs and it is absolutely not enough to reduce the interest to 
the oder and neisse border he said 
the federal republic of germany belongs among the most 
democratic states and we should know more about how the federal 
republic was formed and the welfare of germans was ensured he 
said 
michnik a key opposition activist before solidarity toppled 
polands communist regime last year said there are parallels 
between germany and poland 
he said weizsaecker a german army officer who participated in 
the sept 1 1939 invasion of poland at world war iis start also 
has roots in the german political and social groupings from which 
resistance to hitler developed 
this is the german tradition of resistance against a 
totalitarian system the tradition of antitotalitarian resistance 
is also our root it is easier to meet in this field michnik 
wrote 
weizsaecker began his visit wednesday the first of two days of 
meetings in warsaw with president wojciech jaruzelski prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki and other leaders 
on friday he traveled to westerplatte the baltic penisula 
where the first shots of world war ii sounded when a german ship 
opened fire on a small polish garrision he also met with 
solidarity leader lech walesa and toured gdansk which was occupied 
and then destroyed by germany during the war

a centerright party that wants 
croatia to declare its independence from yugoslavia hopes to win 
control of the republics parliament in elections sunday and monday 
the croatian democratic union won 104 of the 131 seats in the 
republics 356seat threehouse parliament in the first round of 
voting april 2223 
the remaining 225 seats are to be decided in the balloting that 
begins sunday and initial results are not expected until monday 
afternoon 
there was no campaigning saturday which was mandated a day of 
silence in the race for the republics first free elections in 50 
years 
political observers believe that another victory for the 
democratic union and its leader franjo tudjman a retired army 
general once imprisoned for almost five years for nationalism will 
intensify the split between croatia and serbia 
the two are the largest of yugoslavias six republics and have 
been fierce rivals since the country was created in 1918 
serbia indicated friday it may follow croatia and its northern 
neighbor slovenia in holding free elections in the next six 
months 
but a victory by proindependence forces in croatia would likely 
bolster the serbian communists who advocate a centralized 
yugoslavia and have used nationalism to help keep a firm grip on 
power in their republic 
yugoslavia already has two distinctly different political 
systems there is oneparty communist rule in serbia and multiparty 
politics in croatia and slovenia 
in free parliamentary elections last month in slovenia the 
republics reform communists were defeated but their popular 
leader milan kucan won the presidency 
croatias reformminded communist party renamed the party for 
democratic reform won only 13 seats in the first round of 
elections and the centrist coalition for national accord won just 
three 
tudjman who ran his westernstyle campaign under the slogan 
croatia belongs to the croatians has expressed confidence his 
party will cap its initial victory and that the new parliament will 
elect him president 
we need the secondround victory after which we will devote 
ourselves to the construction of new croatia he said 
tudjman believes yugoslavias six republics should be 
independent states and establish relations with each other only if 
common interests are involved 
croatias reform communists are more cautious they say the 
current federation is fine for now if it fails to meet croatias 
needs in the future however they say yugoslavia should become a 
confederation without central rule 
serbias media strongly influenced by the communist party call 
tudjman a secessionist or sometimes even a fascist 
croatias 450000 serb minority which faced mass extermination 
in the croatian puppet state set up by nazi germany recently 
staged several rallies denouncing tudjmans ideas 
serbs in croatia say they would demand full autonomy for the 
regions where they live if his party wins the elections

capital of kabul on saturday killing one person and wounding three 
people radio kabul reported 
the rocket attack occured a day after afghan president 
najibullah lifted a 15monthold state of emergency 
the radio broadcast monitored in islamabad blamed the attack 
on pakistanbased extremists apparently referring to 
usbacked rebels 
no one claimed responsibility for the attack 
afghan guerrillas headquartered in pakistan and iran have been 
fighting for 12 years to topple the sovietstyle government in 
kabul 
the united states sends the seven major rebel groups in pakistan 
about 500 million annually in military supplies moscow provides 
about 5 billion a year to its allies in kabul according to 
western diplomats in islamabad 
soviet troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 at the 
invitation of the prosoviet government of babrak karmal by the 
start of 1988 before moscow agreed to withdraw troops some 
103000 soviet troops and about 50000 afghan army troops were 
pitted against some 200000 guerrillas 
the soviets withdrew the last of their troops in february 1989 
but moscow said military advisers would remain 
up to 15000 soviet troops were killed during the intervention 
the state department says exact afghan casualties are unavailable 
but it says there were 1 million afghan deaths there are a total 
of about 5 million refugees of whom about 3 million are in 
pakistan and 19 million in iran

federal drug agents served warrants to confiscate 
176 million in south florida financial institutions as a 
nationwide drug money laundering crackdown focuses on suspicious 
accounts a spokesman said saturday 
federal officials froze 400 million in more than 750 accounts 
nationally three weeks ago as part of the longrunning operation 
polar cap investigators have been working to pin down the origin 
of the funds said drug enforcement administration spokesman john 
fernandes 
the seizure warrants served friday in south florida covering 
176 million were for accounts in which investigators have 
concluded that there was probable cause to believe the money 
was drug proceeds fernandes said saturday he said he didnt have 
any detail on what seizure orders might have been issued in other 
parts of the country 
the warrants were served on bank officers for 72 accounts at 20 
south florida banks a legal step in the process of transferring 
the suspected drug cartel money to federal coffers in all 
accounts had been frozen in 78 miami banks 
the government also could prosecute bankers and the account 
holders after tracing the money fernandes said 
if we show complicity on the part of a bank or bank official 
or some representative of a corporation or a front corporation or 
what have you that would be a separate part of the civil action 
the dea spokesman said 
meanwhile the account holders are preparing to fight the 
freezing or loss of funds with some arguing they were involved in 
flight capital sending of assets from troubled foreign 
countries to the united states and not money laundering 
its the only way people in colombia can have dollars in the 
united states to avoid inflation and other problems with the 
colombian economy said fred schwartz an attorney for a 
colombian industrialist with 600000 in frozen accounts 
schwartz and other attorneys say their clients bought dollars in 
latin america on the black market a huge pot of money swelled by 
the cocaine trade without knowing the cash was drugtainted 
the money then was transferred to us accounts often in 
violation of currency laws abroad as a cushion against the 
vagaries of latin american economics and politics 
javier murcio a flight capital expert with drimcgraw hill a 
lexington mass consulting firm said the dea seizures must 
induce some nervousness on the part of these individuals 
but he doubted flight capital would be driven from miami banks 
because of the enforcement saying people who are going to take 
it out of their countries will always do so regardless of the 
circumstances 
fernandes indicated the seizure warrants covered some drug money 
that was laundered through foreign currency black markets before it 
was deposited in us banks 
i wouldnt want to stereotype it he said playing with 
the black market is only one way of getting the drug money 
through the technology used is only limited to the imagination of 
the money launderers 
the justice department obtained a court order april 16 in 
atlanta to freeze accounts in 173 banks in 22 states after 
investigators estimated colombias medellin cartel amassed 12 
billion from cocaine sales from 1987 to early 1989 
federal officials believe 400 million was returned to the 
united states to support drug trafficking

nearly 140 masterpieces from two formidable 
family collections including a celebrated 407 million 
selfportrait by pablo picasso are going on display sunday at the 
national gallery of art 
opening in the gallerys modernistic east building is the first 
and only us exhibition of 85 old masters impressionists 
postimpressionists and early modern works from the collection of 
the late swiss industrialist emil g buehrle 
appearing simultaneously in the gallerys west building is the 
entire collection of 54 paintings watercolors and drawings from 
the home of millionaire publisher walter h annenberg in rancho 
mirage calif shown together for the first time on a national 
tour that began last summer in philadelphia 
gallery director j carter brown called the twin exhibitions a 
fabulous doubleheader and said that we may never see in our 
lifetime a concentration of art of such quality and importance 
first lady barbara bush wearing a white jacket and pearls 
attended a gallery reception in annenbergs honor wednesday night 
and toured his collection with brown as her personal guide she is 
said to be an admirer of french impressionist paintings 
brown said the buehrle exhibit was drawn from 321 works many 
of them rarely seen in public that comprise one of the greatest 
private collections to have been created in the 20th century 
the 38 italian dutch french and spanish artists represented in 
the show range from frans hals and francisco goya to impressionists 
edouard manet camille pissarro edgar degas paul cezanne claude 
monet paul gauguin and vincent van gogh 
among the 20th century masters in the exhibit titled the 
passionate eye impressionist and other master paintings from the 
collection of emil g buehrle are henri matisse georges braque 
picasso franz marc and wassily kandinsky 
brown said annenberg a philanthropist publisher and former 
us ambassador to britain and his wife leonore had assembled 
one of the worlds greatest private collections of impressionist 
and postimpressionist art 
the national gallery show includes three recent annenberg 
acquisitions that did not appear in the philadelphia exhibit 
braques the studio henri fantinlatours asters and fruit 
on a table and the picasso selfportrait au lapin agile 
annenberg bought the 1905 picasso painting at sothebys in new 
york last november for 407 million the third most expensive 
artwork ever sold at auction 
since he sold his publishing empire to rupert murdoch for 3 
billion in 1988 the 82yearold collector has accelerated his art 
purchases amid intense speculation over the eventual fate of his 
masterpieces 
if annenberg leaves his collection to a museum the national 
gallery is considered a likely candidate along with the 
metropolitan museum of art in new york the philadelphia museum of 
art and possibly the los angeles county museum of art 
 
 
brown ducked a reporters question last week about the national 
gallerys chances of acquiring the annenberg collection which 
includes eight cezannes five van goghs six monets and other 
paintings by degas gauguin matisse and pierreauguste renoir the 
show also includes an annenberg portrait by andrew wyeth and a 
montage by romare bearden of the roots television miniseries 
that annenberg commissioned for the cover of tv guide 
americans will never have another chance to view the buehrle 
collection after its current world tour unless they travel to the 
family home in zurich switzerland when the tour ends the family 
says it will retire the collection from international lending 
the buehrle show underwritten by martin marietta corp will 
remain until july 15 it also will appear at the montreal museum of 
fine arts aug 3 through oct 14 the yokohama museum of art in 
japan nov 2 to jan 13 1991 and the royal academy of arts in 
london feb 1 to april 14

lava from kilauea volcano cut off the 
last road out of this coastal community saturday and nearly 
encircled the towns store and a church 
part of the lava flow was headed toward an area of sand dunes 
about 225 yards from the ocean according to hawaii county civil 
defense spokesman bruce butts 
another finger of lava was headed toward a park and was about 50 
yards from the park boundary he said 
the kalapana store and driveinn the communitys meeting place 
and the kalapana mauna kea congregational church still were 
standing although nearly encircled by lava butts said 
lava was filling a gulley behind the two buildings in the heart 
of the village and was expected to eventually reach them he said 
the blazing hot lava has destroyed a total of 134 homes 
including 50 in the past month since kilaueas east rift zone 
began erupting on jan 3 1983 
the historic starofthesea catholic church known for its 
brightly painted murals was moved to higher ground friday before 
lava cut off the escape route 
members of the congregational church earlier decided not to move 
their church partly because of termite damage 
if its gods will that the building goes go its his will 
said church moderator bernice mckeague 
officials were concerned about a possible health threat when the 
hot lava reaches the oceans salt water because that produces 
steam clouds known as laze containing hydrochloric acid and other 
potentially hazardous chemicals 
our main concern is the tradewinds butts said as long as 
there are tradewinds the laze will be blown away 
if winds shift our concern mainly will be for the command 
post and the people on the barricades he said 
we will play it by ear and watch the wind situation but if 
there is a wind shift we may have to move people 
us rep daniel akaka recently named to the us senate to 
succeed the late spark matsunaga attended a service with members 
of the congregational church friday 
he said he hopes federal aid will be approved possibly within 
the next week he said he met with visiting representatives of the 
federal emergency management agency before they returned to 
washington

secretary of state james a baker iii 
for we meet in recognition that a historical process is under 
way the unification of germans in peace and freedom today we 
engage in an act of reconciliation of a people too long 
separated of a continent too long divided 
in helping germany achieve freedom and unity i believe all the 
states and peoples of europe can be the winners that should be our 
aim that is a vision that looks to the future not to the past 
a primary task of this group therefore will be to arrive at 
a formula by which we will terminate and transfer all remaining 
four power rights and responsibilities to a fully sovereign germany 
a germany united within the territory of the federal republic of 
germany the german democratic republic and berlin we must focus 
our efforts on the substance of a final settlement not on the 
symbols of the past 
unification will have important implications for each of us 
in our relations with germany as well as for germanys place in 
the new evolving european order the united states recognizes that 
others among the four powers have legitimate interests that may 
need to be addressed as part of the twoplusfour process we 
believe that this forum may be an appropriate place for discussions 
of such issues but it is our view that this forum should take 
decisions only on those issues relevant to four power rights and 
responsibilities

the collapse of the warsaw pact had rendered the missile 
obsolete and the west germans and members of the us congress had 
opposed plans to upgrade the system 
cheney in an interview with cable news networks newsmaker 
program said the united states should wait before withdrawing the 
some 700 nowobsolete missiles and the approximately 1500 
nucleartipped artillery shells in europe 
until the soviets have removed their nuclear forces 
shortrange nuclear forces in east germany it makes no sense for 
us to take ours out of west germany cheney said in the interview 
the pentagon chief said only when the soviets remove all their 
forces from eastern europe then i think well have a high degree 
of confidence then we can reduce our own forces 
cheney is scheduled to meet this week in canada with nato 
defense ministers and is expected to discuss the issue of 
shortrange nuclear forces bush said thursday that the 16member 
nato alliance should meet in late june or july to consider a 
political and military strategy 
in the interview cheney also described his vision of the future 
us military in europe that would include fewer army divisions and 
greater reliance on reserve forces 
in addition you can probably dualbase some of your air 
squadrons some of them back here in the united states with bases 
in europe that they would move to in wartime cheney said

manuel noriegas selfdescribed personal 
banker worried two years ago that hed be killed if he testified 
before the us senate about the panamanian rulers financial 
dealings a tape recorded conversation shows 
if i say anything about noriega and its reported by the 
press im dead amjad awan said in a secretly recorded tape 
played friday in his federal drug moneylaundering trial he 
knows that i know everything 
the banker uneasy at being subpoenaed to testify before the 
senate in september 1988 said he could trace the flow of the 
dictators cash to accounts outside panama 
its a question of money and i know exactly where he has 
what awan unwittingly told an undercover agent and no matter 
how much he likes me how much of a friend i am when it comes 
to money when his back is towards the wall you know 
the tape concluded the 15th week of government testimony that 
awan four fellow bankers at the luxembourgbased bank of credit 
and commerce international and a colombian laundered cash they knew 
to be drug proceeds 
awan had no reason to suspect the friend he was chatting with at 
a plush miami restaurant was an agent for more than a year awan 
had helped robert musella move large amounts of cash from the 
united states to secret overseas accounts 
musella however was the identity assumed by drug enforcement 
administration agent robert mazur 
he told awan on tapes already played at the trial that the money 
was coming from some of colombias largest cocaine dealers awan 
said he didnt care that it wasnt up to him to judge the morality 
of where the money came from 
awan and the other defendants maintain their innocence the 
bankers say they were victims of the luxembourg bank managements 
passion to expand and attract new capital 
two divisions of the bank one of the worlds largest private 
financial institutions pleaded guilty to moneylaundering charges 
when trial began in january in a plea bargain the luxembourg bank 
forfeited 15 million in frozen assets and interest 
on the tape awan is heard questioning how the banks 
highpowered washington lawyer former secretary of state clark 
clifford was handling the senate subpoena 
awan expressed his fear that clifford was about to sell him out 
to protect the luxembourg bank and cliffords bank first american 
bank from scandal 
awan said the luxembourg banks board was so anxious to keep him 
from talking and avoid scandal that it even urged him to get out of 
the united states to transfer from his miami office possibly to 
paris 
the banker also predicted the bank would duck the subpoena by 
telling the subcommittee that no noriega banking records existed in 
this country and that noriega wouldnt surrender the banks records 
in panama 
clifford later gave a similar response to sen john kerry the 
subcommittees chairman 
records seized when the bankers were arrested showed at least 
600000 of noriegas money flowed from panama to europe through 
bcci accounts at cliffords washington bank 
awan told the subcommittee in september 1988 that he once 
handled 23 million in noriegas personal accounts and said he 
deposited money for noriega in accounts at first american bank 
where clifford was president 
clifford has denied any involvement by the luxembourg bank in 
first american other than some overlapping shareholders 
but on the tape awan said the bank owned first american despite 
a series of shareholders designed to conceal the banks ownership 
the truth of the matter is he said the bank belongs to 
bcci

former defense minister yitzhak rabin said 
saturday he will challenge shimon peres for leadership of the 
leftleaning labor party and polls indicated that rabin could lead 
the party to victory 
a poll published friday in the mass circulation yediot ahronot 
newspaper showed rabin defeating caretaker prime minister yitzhak 
shamir of the rightwing likud bloc by a 21 margin if direct 
elections for israels leader were held 
israeli voters chose political parties and not candidates but a 
campaign to reform the electoral system and institute direct 
elections has been gaining substantial momentum 
rabins challenge to party leader shimon peres was widely 
expected after peres failed to form a coalition government last 
week leaving shamir in a position to head israels next 
government if shamir is unable to form a coalition elections 
could be held 
i believe that after a long period and several elections the 
time has come to have a soul searching to decide who can lead the 
party in the next elections with a better chance to win them 
rabin said 
asked whether he was a candidate for leadership rabin replied 
i believe that i or maybe others could lead the party 
i believe that there is a need for change he added 
rabin said a likud government can cause damage to israel in 
the fields of the peace process international relations in their 
policies in the occupied territories the settlements 
calls for a change in party leadership have been echoed by other 
labor legislators and rabins popularity seems to be growing within 
the party and the nation 
rabin served as army chief of staff during the 1967 middle east 
war when israel seized the west bank from jordan and the gaza 
strip from egypt he also served as prime minister from 1974 to 
1977 
he was defense minister in the likudlabor joint government from 
1984 to march of this year when labor collapsed the government to 
protest likuds refusal to accept us proposals to advance the 
peace process 
rabins tough policy in handling the palestinian uprising has 
won him widespread popularity 
the poll in the yediot ahronot daily was conducted may 12 by 
the dahaf agency and showed that 60 percent of the 515 people 
questioned prefered rabin for prime minister while only 32 percent 
chose shamir 
pollster mina zemech said the poll examined the voting 
preferences of jews but excluded settlers and people living on 
communal farms she said the margin of error was 4 percent to 5 
percent 
also saturday israeli soldiers shot and killed a palestinian 
after arab protesters in a west bank refugee camp threw stones and 
a firebomb at troops the army said 
mohammed shaker almasri 25 was struck in the heart with a 
bullet and died at tulkarum hospital arab reports and hospital 
officials said 
almasris death brought to 682 the number of palestinians 
killed by israelis during the 29monthold rebellion against the 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip fortythree israelis 
have also died in the violence 
palestinians have killed about 210 of their fellow arabs mainly 
on suspicion of collaborating with israeli authorities

1915 led the line of about 270 degree recipients 
all had been awarded diplomas upon graduating some as long as 
82 years ago but none had been granted a certified college degree 
thats because until 1944 the school wasnt fully accredited now 
it offers the required liberal arts curriculum to make it a 
fullfledged fouryear college 
like trenn who had studied mechanical design most of the 
preaccreditation graduates who lined up for honorary degrees 
saturday used their schooling to earn their livings in art and 
design 
the oldest living preaccreditation graduate painter mary 
crosby 102 and class of 1908 was unable to attend but she was to 
be given her honorary degree later by school president thomas f 
schutte 
the 113yearold school sent out 670 invitations complete with 
mortar boards and tassels many former students who could not 
attend the commencement wrote to ask that their new degrees be sent 
to them 
you symbolize the heart and spirt of risd peter freeman 
chairman of the schools board of trustees told those honored to 
the applause of about 500 friends and relatives you are the 
living proof that all the energy expended to educate budding

tens of thousands of people 
gathered on a sunny hillside saturday to remember the cofounder of 
czechoslovakia 71 years after he was killed in a plane crash 
under communist rulers who were swept out of power in last 
winters peaceful revolution the republics cofounder gen milan 
r stefanik and its first president thomas garrigue masaryk were 
virtually taboo figures accorded almost no public honors 
on saturday president vaclav havel joined tens of thousands of 
people attended the nationally televised ceremony at bradlo the 
site where stefanik crashed in 1919 the town is some 60 miles 
north of the regional slovak capital of bratislava 
we gathered here to renew the tradition of annual national 
pilgrimage to bradlo a tradition which was created spontaneously 
by our people in the first czechoslovak republic and which was 
interrupted by our last regime milan cic premier of the slovak 
regional government said after a wreathlaying ceremony 
the ceremony was used as a time to emphasize the unity between 
the czech and slovak people who constitute the dominant ethnic 
groups within the nation 
those ties were strained in recent weeks by a debate over a new 
name for the country last month slovaks pushed parliament to 
change the republics name to the czech and slovak federative 
republic to emphasize the distinct role that slovaks have played 
in the state 
stefanik understood that it was necessary to unite the destiny 
of the slovak nation with the destiny of the czechs he understood 
this as well as tomas garrigue masaryk who knew that it was the 
only way to create a strong state here a state which the czech 
lands could never become without the slovaks havel told the 
crowd 
the era of psuedoindependence and federated totality has 
ended havel said referring to the communist past now the era 
of brotherly cooperation of two autonomous nations is beginning 
the languages of the two groups are very similar but their 
history and traditions vary the czech region of bohemia was one of 
the first places in europe to undergo industrialization while 
slovakia is far more rural and still preserves peasant customs

for the first time in three decades 
opposition parties are being allowed to apply for legal standing to 
challenge the ruling party 
at least five opposition parties had formally registered as of 
friday state television reported saturday registration is the 
first step toward legalization 
presidential and legislative elections are to take place by the 
years end but a date has not yet been set 
state television which generally ignores antigovernment 
protests or statements by critics showed film of news conferences 
of two opposition groups on saturday night 
the opposition leaders themselves were not heard but an 
announcer listed some of their complaints 
the ruling democratic party has dominated this west african 
nation since independence from france in 1960 opposition parties 
were legal under the nations constitution but none had been 
allowed to operate 
the change in policy came this week when president felix 
houphouetboigny on thursday approved a recommendation from his 
party to allow the opposition groups to register 
he acted after several weeks of violent protests triggered by 
austerity measures demonstrators initially opposed the imposition 
of wage cuts and increased taxes but then began calling for the 
presidents removal 
the demonstrations included stoning and burning dozens of 
government vehicles buses and schools one student was killed

the richest ocean wildlife sanctuary on the 
west coast is threatened by a large radioactive waste dump piled 
high with corroded barrels leaking plutonium and cesium according 
to a new federal report 
many of the corroding 55gallon barrels dumped between 1946 and 
1970 in the gulf of the farallones national marine sanctuary 
wildlife sanctuary have burst from water pressure according to the 
study 
the federal study was reported in the san francisco examiners 
sunday edition 
yet more than 20 years after the government acknowledged that at 
least 47500 barrels of us atomic lab and industrial wastes lie 
in or adjacent to the sanctuary the site remains virtually 
unstudied for its effects on marine life said the report by the 
national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
the report urges further study of possible radioactive 
contamination of commercial fisheries of pacific herring dover 
sole rockfish sablefish and dungeness crab and hefty rockfish 
sports catches 
the report was prepared under an agreement between the 
environmental protection agency and noaa epa has authority for 
placing sites on the superfund the national priorities list of the 
worst toxic dumps noaa a branch of the us department of 
commerce is the trustee for marine resources under superfund 
two years ago a contractor to the epa rated the farallon 
islands radioactive waste dump as high priority for 
investigation for superfund 
but no action has been taken by epa and now noaa is pushing epa 
to make an assessment of the potential danger of the dump on the 
marine life 
weve started to dictate our own direction to projects that we 
think need our attention said jim bybee northern california 
environmental coordinator for noaas national marine fisheries 
in southern california noaa which operates the nations marine 
sanctuaries filed notice of intent to sue chemical and petroleum 
companies for polluting bays and the ocean with ddt and heavy 
metals 
once in the environment plutonium can last for hundreds of 
thousands of years its halflife is 24360 years and the rule of 
thumb is that it takes about 10 halflives before it decays to 
background levels 
in past studies the sediments at the farallones have shown 
higher than normal levels of longlived and dangerous plutonium and 
cesium possibly more than 1000 times expected background levels 
sole rockfish and sablefish which are eaten by humans feed 
on worms and tiny shrimp that feed in these sediments and are most 
likely accumulating the radioactivity scientists say 
the farallones marine ecosystem supports the largest population 
of seabirds south of alaska and an abundance of fish invertebrates 
and marine mammals

attorneys for exxon corp and its 
shipping company have convinced a federal judge that criminal 
charges stemming from the nations largest oil spill are too 
complicated to be heard as soon june 18 
us district judge h russel holland has postponed the trial 
indefinitely 
the june 18 date was chosen to comply with the federal speedy 
trial rule which requires cases to be heard within a certain time 
following indictment 
exxon and exxon shipping co are charged with two felonies and 
three misdemeanors 
felony counts accuse the company of allowing an incompetent crew 
to operate the exxon valdez on march 23 and 24 1989 the 
misdemeanor counts are for alleged violations of the federal clean 
water refuse and migratory bird treaty acts 
motions filed by exxon attorneys argue that most of the charges 
have not been used in oilspill situations 
holland agreed in a motion signed wednesday he said exxon 
demonstrated that this prosecution involves novel questions of 
fact and law and that there is an extraordinary volume of data to 
be digested by both the government and exxon 
holland asked prosecutors and defense attorneys to propose a new 
trial date by june 11 
the case stems from the march 24 1989 wreck of the tanker 
exxon valdez which struck a charted reef shortly after midnight 
and spewed nearly 11 million gallons of north slope crude oil into 
prince william sound 
an anchorage jury in march rejected charges that former exxon 
skipper joseph hazelwood was drunk when the grounding occurred 
according to testimony chief mate james kunkel said he warned 
hazelwood that the seaman who took the helm on the disastrous 
voyage needed extra supervision for any task he took on 
the seaman robert kagan was under the supervision of third 
mate gregory cousins who testified that kagan had understeered 
the exxon valdez failing to turn hard enough to avoid the 
grounding

negotiators for striking greyhound drivers and 
the bus line recessed negotiations saturday after a ninehour 
bargaining session failed to produce a new contract in the 2month 
walkout 
the federal mediation and conciliation service said both sides 
were reviewing proposals and that mediators hoped to schedule new 
talks within a few days 
the talks were the first in the walkout since midmarch and came 
a day after the company reported a 56 million loss for the first 
three months this year 
much of saturdays session was devoted to a review of the 
companys financial situation and how it would impact a potential 
contract said a source close to negotiations money problems made 
the bargaining process extremely difficult the source said 
the lack of another scheduled meeting is not a good sign 
the source said noting negotiators had originally talked of 
possibly meeting sunday and monday as well 
a fourhour round of morning negotiations which mostly involved 
each side talking separately with federal mediators produced 
very little progress union president edward m strait said 
after labor and management broke separately for lunch 
were feeling the process out right now strait said 
were hopeful well reach a settlement 
greyhound vice president anthony p lannie the companys top 
negotiator also said nothings happened so far but indicated 
that was because the two sides had spent most of the time in the 
morning session with mediators 
the negotiators left by a basement exit after the afternoon 
session avoiding reporters 
lannie and strait are trying to settle disputes over wages job 
security and seniority issues for the 6300 striking drivers and 
3000 clerical and maintenance workers who walked out march 2 
union spokesman nick nichols said striking drivers were hopeful 
a new contract could be reached soon because there appeared to be 
less acrimony and tension between the two sides 
strait head of the amalgamated council of greyhound local 
unions and lannie met with bernard e delury director of the 
mediation service and two other federal mediators each side 
brought along a team of negotiators 
nichols said the strike has not been easy on either side 
noting union members have been receiving 50 a week in strike 
benefits 
the walkout halted intercity bus service in nearly half of the 
10000 communities greyhound serves greyhound the only nationwide 
bus line has said it has since restored about 83 percent of its 
normal service 
but on friday the company said it had suffered a 558 million 
loss in the januarymarch quarter compared with a 144 million 
loss in the first quarter of 1989 it turned a profit of under 1 
million last year 
the company blamed 20 million of this years firstquarter loss 
on security for the shootings bomb threats and other violent 
incidents that have occurred since the strike began nine weeks ago 
clearly the information verifies what we have thought for 
some time that the strike was being very effective and it was 
important to get back to the table nichols said 
a source close to the process said the companys financial 
situation might mean both sides are going to have to be creative 
about the seniority and money areas 
citing the violence the company withdrew from negotiations in 
midmarch there have been more than 30 shootings at buses and 
terminals since the strike began 
the union has strongly denied any involvement with the violence 
and supported prosecution for those involved it said union members 
also were the victims of violence a striking driver was crushed to 
death on the second day of the strike by a bus driven by a 
replacement driver 
the companys last offer was for 63 million in wage hikes over 
three years although the union contends the bus line is inflating 
the figure because the bus line wants to link pay increases to 
corporate performance such as increased ridership 
drivers who earn an average of 24743 a year are trying to 
recover some of the wage and benefit concessions they have given 
the company over the past decade 
besides wages the two sides also need to resolve a dispute over 
the replacement drivers greyhound has hired since the strike began 
the company wants to let those 2500 drivers keep their jobs and 
put a like amount of union drivers on a waiting list the union 
wants its members to keep their jobs and retain seniority over 
replacements 
there are also several disputes over work rules and grievance 
procedures 
greyhounds financial statement friday said it was developing a 
financial restructuring plan 
the bus line had maintained it had sufficient cash to withstand 
the strike and would make a 975 million debt interest payment due 
may 15 
but the company said friday that it would miss that payment it 
also said it missed lease and other payments due april 30 
the company also said it expects to lose money in april may and 
possibly june before returning to profitability 
greyhound already laid off about 270 mechanics last month

mikhail s gorbachev on saturday rejected 
latvias declaration of independence and threatened the baltic 
republic with unspecified political economic and administrative 
measures if it doesnt reverse its course tass reported 
the soviet presidents decision came one day after latvias 
parliament adopted the independence declaration and was announced 
late saturday night on latvian television by alfreds rubiks the 
republics communist party chief rubiks remarks were reported 
early sunday by tass the official soviet news agency 
the latvian legislators had called for a slow transition to 
independence and for negotiations with moscow to avoid the sharp 
economic sanctions the soviet union imposed on neighboring 
lithuania which declared its independence march 11 
rubiks spoke by telephone with gorbachev earlier saturday and 
said the soviet leader considered the attempt by the latvians to 
portray their decision as different from lithuanias was 
groundless tass reported 
the president of the ussr considers that the declaration 
that was passed may 4 by the latvian parliament on the restoration 
of independence of the latvian republic signifies a violation of 
constitutional norms and is leading toward the breakdown of 
governmental ties of the republics of the ussr rubiks quoted 
gorbachev as saying 
gorbachev emphasized negotiations are possible only under the 
guidelines of the soviet constitution and that negotiations can 
only begin after a reversal of the declaration of independence 
tass quoted rubiks as saying 
the news agency quoted rubiks as saying that if the republic 
ignores the soviet constitution the president reserves the right 
to take political economic and administrative measures in response 
he did not elaborate on what measures gorbachev might take in 
midapril the soviet leader slapped an economic embargo on 
lithuania for its proindependence moves cutting off all oil and 
sharply curtailing natural gas and other key supplies to the 
republic 
gorbachevs decision on latvia was not broadcast on national 
soviet tv saturday night and he did not make any reference to it 
in a public appearance in moscow earlier in the day 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis said he is still 
waiting for moscow to begin talks with his representatives even 
after he endorsed the idea of slowing the drive for independence 
on may 15 lithuania is expected to exhaust its reserve supplies 
of oil natural gas and other raw materials its deputy prime 
minister algirdas brazauskas said 
on monday lithuania will decide whether to retaliate by cutting 
off its supplies of meat and dairy products to moscow and 
leningrad brazauskas said 
gediminas vagnorius a lithuanian lawmaker said saturday the 
soviet embargo has forced 12500 people out of work in the 
industrial construction and transportation sectors although many 
have been transferred to other needed jobs 
the independence declaration by latvias supreme soviet 
parliament on friday was greeted with fireworks and jubilant crowds 
danced in the streets of the capital riga 
the vote for independence was 1380 with one abstention and one 
lawmaker absent but 57 deputies did not vote in protest and 
rubiks and another antiindependence deputies walked out of the 
hall to show their displeasure 
in a message to gorbachev the deputies said the declaration 
opens the door to a transition period a period of close 
dialogue close cooperation and wide political economic and 
human contacts latvian president anatoly gorbunov had even said 
low level negotiations with moscow would begin may 15 
rubiks predicted the declaration of independence would not be 
supported by his constituents who would begin strikes 
demonstrations and appeals for gorbachev to impose presidential 
rule 
on saturday morning a group of about 300 people gathered to 
denounce the declaration interfront a group of ethnic russians 
and other nonlatvians organized the rally on cathedral square 
where speakers mounted an army truck to demand the withdrawal of 
the declaration 
only 54 percent of latvias 27 million people are ethnic 
latvians most of the remainder are ethnic russians many of whom 
oppose independence 
also saturday a group of latvian economists announced plans to 
introduce their own currency in the republic economists of the new 
latvia fund said work was under way to restore the presoviet 
latvian currency the lat 
the fund created last month plans to issue 11 million in 
bonds and lottery tickets that can be sold abroad to finance the 
creation and printing of the new currency they said 
similar plans to issue currencies have been announced in estonia 
and lithuania but none has been issued yet

a state commission appointed to study the 
future of the 6 millionacre adirondack park called saturday for 
strict new curbs on development in the largest such wilderness 
tract in the lower 48 states 
many of the 245 proposals by the commission on the adirondacks 
in the 21st century immediately drew fire from some of the parks 
130000 residents who hope increased development can bolster the 
regions weak economy 
though the mountainous area in northern new york is called a 
park it actually is a patchwork of public land and private 
property use of the private land is controlled to some extent by a 
state law requiring parts of the region be kept forever wild 
the commission recommended the state buy an additional 650000 
acres of the park more than 1000 square miles 
about half the parks land is in private hands the panel 
proposed to reclassify 90 percent of that land for resource 
use where construction would be prohibited for at least a year 
said the commission 
another proposal to discourage development would require minimum 
2000acre housing sites in some backwoods portions of the park 
under current park rules the largest minimum lot size is 47 acres 
per dwelling 
the commission was appointed by gov mario cuomo and its 
recommendations must be enacted by the state legislature to take 
effect its report should be viewed by park residents as a threat 
to their way of life said adirondack planning commission chairman 
hammond robertson 
they have just lost sight of the american way of life the 
right to own property the right to use property said robertson 
who is also town supervisor of queensbury about 50 miles north of 
albany 
there is a real threat from people outside the park who dont 
really realize that this is our home its a community its not 
just a park its not like central park in new york city said 
robertson 
the cuomo commission insists that something must be done to 
preserve the unique character of the wilderness area 
from within development threatens its forested mountains its 
shorelines and roadsides said the report from outside 
larger threats loom from a booming population looking for 
recreational property to buy from changing economies in the timber 
and tourism industries and from acid rain and deposition of 
airborne toxins 
the cuomo commission is headed by peter berle president of the 
national audubon society and a former commissioner of new york 
states department of environmental conservation 
creation of the commission stirred up 20year old resentment in 
the adirondack mountains where the state already limits 
development through a complex landuse plan devised during the gov 
nelson rockefeller era 
a moratorium would be a useless political maneuver designed 
only to appease the most extreme factions of the environmental 
community said the adirondack fairness coalition a group of 
residents who favor development 
environmental groups most notably the adirondack council are 
urging stricter controls commission members and staff said that 
some of the panels 245 recommendations were aimed at improving 
life for the adirondack people 
the report recommended creation of an adirondack park community 
development corporation to build housing and provide services in 
areas set aside for development 
the panel also called for a sliding tax on home sales starting 
at 1 percent for 150000 homes and rising to 75 percent for those 
sold for more than 250000 the revenue would go toward affordable 
housing programs in the park 
it appears just to be a bone that they threw in to try and 
appease us said frederick monroe chairman of the fairness 
commission and a lawyer in chestertown were not sure theres 
any meat on it

the market for soviet contemporary art once 
heated by glasnost and the new warmth in eastwest relations took 
a chilly plunge saturday when nearly half the paintings at a major 
auction failed to draw bids 
two years ago the soviet unions first international art 
auction attracted celebrity buyers such as rock star elton john and 
pulled in a total of 36 million dollars triple the presale 
estimate by sothebys 
saturdays auction in new york billed as the first major 
auction of soviet contemporary art in the west had roughly the 
same number of paintings by many of the same artists but its total 
revenues barely topped 11 million 
about 60 of the 119 works didnt sell at all 
the people who bought bought extremely well they found some 
good bargains said swiss auctioneer geza von hapsburg chairman 
of the genevabased auction house of habsburg feldman 
at sothebys moscow auction in july 1988 rapidfire bidding 
drove the price for fundamental lexicon a painting by 
45yearold grisha bruskin to 416000 a record for a piece of 
contemporary soviet art 
on saturday the gavel fell quickly on bruskins old 
testament at 36000 in the lower range of the presale estimate 
of 35000 to 40000 and far less than some experts had expected 
few of the 31 artists whose works were on sale attended the 
auction one who did 52yearold vladimir yankilevsky left glumly 
after none of his three pieces was sold 
von hapsburg pronounced himself satisfied he noted that 300 
people packed the auction gallery in manhattans puck building 
there was strong media coverage and a few paintings sold for 
considerably more than predicted 
but he conceded that the bidding on the whole was 
disappointing after the spectacular success of the pathbreaking 
moscow auction 
that was just hype the first one he said today was 
you could say sobering or you could say realistic because 
many of these artists are not well known to the american public 
even though they are the cream of what soviet art produces today 
all but a handful of the paintings that went on the block 
saturday belonged to a single collection amassed in buying trips 
to the soviet union during the past five years by a french art book 
publisher jose alvarez 
von hapsburg contended that the quality of the collection was 
on average higher than the paintings that the soviet government 
allowed to go on sale in moscow 
while some experts might dispute that there is general 
agreement that the artists represented in saturdays auction 
including ilya kabakov ivan chuikov igor kopystianski francisco 
infante and natalia nesterova are among the best in the soviet 
union according to margarita tupitsyn a curatorial consultant in 
soviet contemporary art for the guggenheim museum in new york 
the top price paid for a painting on saturday was 140000 for 
path by kabakov 57 probably the best known contemporary 
soviet artist in the west a spokeswoman for the auction house said 
the buyer was a museum but she declined to identify it without 
permission

turkish cypriots vote sunday in 
parliamentary elections that could bring defeat for the governing 
party and new momentum to stalled peace talks aimed at uniting the 
islands turkish and greek sectors 
analysts said voters in the breakaway turkish republic of 
northern cyprus could unseat president rauf denktashs national 
unity party sunday for the first time in 15 years the region 
created following turkeys 1974 invasion of cyprus is only 
recognized by turkey 
two weeks ago denktash won his fourth term as president by 
capturing 67 percent of the vote but his party appears much less 
popular 
analysts said if the national struggle party an opposition 
coalition wins power it would leave denktash virtually powerless 
because most decisions are made by the legislature and the 
president has little executive power 
the opposition has accused denktash of intransigence in 
reunification talks on cyprus 
while opposition leaders said they would welcome peace talks 
they have also indicated they would not retreat from the 
traditional turkish demand for a loose federation with both zones 
turkey will also remain a factor in future negotiations ankara 
maintains an estimated 30000 troops in the north and has given 
substantial funding to the republic 
the opposition coalition comprises the conservative new birth 
party mainly supported by settlers from turkey the leftist 
socialist liberation and the republican turkish party 
in the last elections in 1985 the parties received a combined 
vote of 61 percent but their divided votes gave them a minority of 
seats in the 50member parliament 
the opposition has accused the governing party of widespread 
corruption and the misuse of economic resources

twentytwo years after their capture by north 
korea and two years after being snubbed by their own government 
the crew of the uss pueblo received prisoner of war medals saturday 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
gathered by san diego bay to be recognized as prisoners of war for 
enduring 11 months in captivity in north korea in 1968 
the sailors a few of whom are still on active duty with the 
navy received the awards in a ceremony conducted by assistant 
secretary of the navy barbara pope she read a statement from 
president bush commending the crew for its unfailing resolve 
it was a day of celebration for the former shipmates but for 
former pueblo cmdr lloyd pete bucher who had worked to see 
the men honored for their courage under captivity it also was a 
day of redemption for the ship 
this is what needed to be done when we got home bucher 
said after the 40minute ceremony they needed to tell these guys 
that they had served well 
what they got was a very military function called a board of 
inquiry and then byebye they did receive some awards later on 
but it was done more or less in private i wanted these guys 
recognized in public 
when the pow medal was authorized by congress in 1988 the crew 
of the pueblo was excluded from eligibility the pentagon had ruled 
that the crew was merely detained rather than according the 
sailors pow status 
its a day of great for me personally bucher said i have 
never been happier than i am today 
the pueblo was captured jan 23 1968 in international waters 
after being fired on by north korean vessels the crew was 
tortured endured public humiliation and resisted efforts by the 
north koreans to be used for propaganda purposes before being 
released in december 1968 
even after a formal navy court of inquiry many questions remain 
about the koreans reason for seizing the ship and about the 
failure of us forces to respond to calls for help before bucher 
surrendered the ship and crew 
bucher and other pueblo officers were recommended for courts 
martial at the time of the inquiry but the navy never tried them 
during a ceremony attended by about 500 people including the 
families of some of the crew members the sailors heard praise that 
had eluded them for more than two decades 
these men once were snubbed by our government when the medals 
were first awarded said rep nicholas mavroules who bucher 
credited for eventually getting the medals approved in congress 
that was an oversight today in a small way we are trying to 
right that wrong 
fc skip schumacher jr acknowledged the honor on behalf of 
the crew 
the pow medal is to honor those people who served and served 
honorably and im here to tell you today that this crew did serve 
honorably schumacher said drawing applause 
bucher has in the past accused the navy of putting the ship in 
dangerous position without adequate support 
bucher declined to speak at the ceremony and said later it was 
because hed been too emotional 
in a sense the medals close the books on the pueblo affair 
bucher said now we move on to just reunions and watching one 
anothers kids and grandkids grow up

sac and fox indians received an apology 
saturday from wisconsin for the 1832 bad axe massacre during which 
hundreds of their tribal predecessors were killed while trying to 
flee white pursuers 
i thank you sir elmer manatowa of stroud okla chief of 
the sacfox nation told a state legislator who presented a 
proclamation of apology from the wisconsin assembly during a 
ceremony 
the sac and fox nation in oklahoma is thriving one hundred 
years ago one might have thought the sac and fox might not be in 
existence today manatowa said 
gunfire on the banks of the mississippi river 158 years ago 
ended a trek of hundreds of miles by men women and children led by 
chief black hawk after white settlers evicted the tribes from their 
ancestral lands near rock island ill 
known to history as the black hawk war the relentless pursuit 
of the fleeing indians and the riverside massacre was described by 
one historian as one of the bloodiest tragedies in the sad 
history of americanindian relations the indians were attacked 
by army soldiers state militia and settlers 
the ceremony at the battle site about 20 miles downstream from 
la crosse was attended by about 200 people 
wisconsin chippewa currently debating the state over treaty 
rights to offreservation natural resources have participated in 
memorial ceremonies at the site in previous years 
attorney truman carter of stroud the sacfox treasurer said 
20th century disputes among indians and nonindians must be 
resolved in the courts not in the field 
the assembly proclamation was presented by state rep david 
clarenbach the resolution was adopted last year at the urging of 
milwaukeebased honor our neighbors origins and rights 
what we do is not without example elsewhere clarenbach 
said the state of minnesota apologized to the sioux for mass 
executions carried out without due process after an indian 
uprising in the 1860s 
congress has acknowledged the impropriety of internment of 
japaneseamericans and the new regimes of eastern europe draw great 
moral strength from the admission of past wrongs he said 
tribal leaders from the sac and fox nation in iowa oklahoma and 
kansas were invited to the ceremony 
since 1955 a roadside placard has told visitors about the 
battle during which black hawks people trying to escape across 
the mississippi were hounded into riverside marshes where they 
were shot or drowned 
to have the state of wisconsin publicly apologize is something 
we look at manatowa said last week i am going to ask the 
state of wisconsin to do the same thing for the chippewa to do 
something to ease the relationship up there 
more than 1000 sac and fox had gathered at the river after 
eluding militia at the battle of wisconsin heights near madison a 
maneuver some historians say classified black hawk as a military 
genius 
the army aided by an armed steamboat on the river launched a 
campaign to stop them black hawk tried to surrender at bad axe but 
troops disregarded the plea witnesses said estimates of indian 
deaths range from 850 to 1400 
what a terrible day it was in 1832 what a great day this 
is hilary waukau sr a menominee tribal legislator said during 
the ceremony 
the massacre was one of the bloodiest tragedies in the sad 
history of americanindian relations historian ray allen 
billington wrote in a book called westward expansion a history 
of the american frontier 
the site in southwestern wisconsin contains many reminders 
besides victory a nearby hamlet named by whites after the battle 
theres also black hawk campground black hawk marina battle 
island battle bluff a town called retreat and another called 
soldiers grove

costa rica and a group of us banks

army troops backed by fighter bombers 
and helicopter gunships raided crude jungle laboratories and seized 
16400 pounds of cocaine an army general said saturday 
it was the largest haul of cocaine in colombia since march 10 
1984 when agents seized 22000 pounds in what was believed to be 
the biggest seizure of the drug to date 
two men were killed and 14 were arrested in the raids gen 
humberto castaneda said in a broadcast interview with the rcn radio 
chain 
the raids began thursday and by saturday morning the army had 
landed troops at 20 clandestine runways where five airplanes were 
seized the general said in the rcn interview 
one of the planes seized was from bolivia castaneda said 
cocaine paste is brought from bolivia and peru to colombia where 
it is converted into pure cocaine through chemical processing 
the raids were in the state of meta in an area about 200 miles 
southeast of the capital of bogota 
castaneda did not disclose how many laboratories were found it 
is common for traffickers to build a cluster of labs in the same 
area to make it more difficult to spot the operation from the air 
the government of president virgilio barco launched an offensive 
against drug traffickers after they were blamed for killing a 
presidential candidate sen luis carlos galan on aug 18 
since then the government security forces have found dozens of 
laboratories seized tons of cocaine and confiscated millions of 
dollars worth of property 
the army and police have seized mansions ranches yachts 
airplanes and luxury cars believed to belong to traffickers 
so far all but one of the chieftains of the medellin cartel have 
eluded the police raids gonzalo rodriguez gacha the reputed no 2 
figure in the cartel was shot during a battle with police dec 15 
on colombias north coast

a british jurist will lead an 
investigation into a shipment of israelimade arms ordered by a 
cabinet official that ended up in the hands of colombian drug 
dealers the government said 
louis blomcooper was chosen by the cabinet at a special meeting 
on friday because of his experience in conducting commissions of 
inquiry and will arrive in the caribbean republic to start this 
week a government statement said friday 
the arms scandal broke in february when colombian authorities 
discovered a cache of israelimade arms in a ranch owned by reputed 
drug lord gonzalo rodriguez gacha who was killed in a gun battle 
with police in december 
the colombian authorities said they found 232 weapons including 
rifles shoulderfired rockets and infrared nightscopes 
a preliminary investigation by a special committee set up here 
determined that the arms shipment passed through antigua a tiny 
island 250 miles southeast of puerto rico on april 24 1989 and 
arrived in colombia five days later 
the scandal has plunged the antiguan government into one of its 
worst crises since prime minister vere bird sr 81 came to power 
in 1956 
minister of public works vere bird jr national security 
adviser to his father was named by the israeli government as the 
antiguan official who ordered the arms shipment in november 1988 
for the antiguan defense forces 
it is unclear how the weapons were then shipped to colombia 
bird jr 54 has denied any wrongdoing and stepped down from 
his post until the matter is resolved 
the twinisland state of antigua and barbuda has a population of 
80000 and gained independence from britain in 1981

the united states secretly bought advanced 
soviet military technology from romania for 10 years before deposed 
dictator nicolae ceausescu was executed according to a published 
report 
the washington post quoting intelligence sources here and 
abroad said the program coordinated by the central intelligence 
agency resulted in more than 40 million being paid to romania 
through foreign middlemen with about 20 percent of that ending up 
in swiss bank accounts controlled by the ceausescu family 
the paper said the ceausescu connection was part of a larger 
weaponsbuying operation that reached into the east bloc military 
and allowed the us military to obtain important components of air 
defense systems that the soviet union has in place to protect 
itself and warsaw pact countries 
the paper said the latest version of the shilka one of the most 
effective antiaircraft systems in the soviet inventory was among 
the items purchased from romania which also sold mobile rocket 
launchers and radar systems 
the potential value of these things is almost incalculable 
the post quoted an unidentified us intelligence officer as 
saying the only way you can truly unlock the secrets of your 
adversaries weapons is to physically have them 
for example access to soviet radar systems aided in development 
of the stealth technology that is designed to allow us 
military planes to avoid radar detection the paper said 
it quoted us government officials as saying that nicolae 
causescu was not personally involved in the dozen or so 
transactions but that the operation could have succeeded only with 
his tacit approval 
the romanian operation came to a halt with causescus overthrow 
last december the paper said 
moreover it said the prodemocracy upheaval in eastern europe 
has disrupted the broader operation but not stopped it 
over the past decade the united states has paid more than 250 
million to obtain the latest versions of sovietmade weapons 
systems through contacts in poland czechoslovakia hungary east 
germany and bulgaria the post quoted its sources as saying 
the willingness of influential military or communist party 
officials to sell secrets to the united states was viewed by some 
us intelligence officials as a reflection of growing discontent 
among some warsaw pact officials 
it was corrupt to the core the paper quoted a former us 
official as saying there was no ideological discrimination if 
you wanted to use this as an indication of the fragility of the 
system this was a classic 
as to the romanian connection the post quoted a retired 
highranking us intelligence official as saying it was just 
greed pure and simple personal greed it was an indication of 
the corruption of the ceausescus and from the us standpoint we 
didnt really care who we dealt with if they could produce 
generally you dont run into sainted characters in this business

the federal aviation administration ordered 
airlines to install an enhanced cockpit warning system to ensure 
cargo doors are properly shut on certain older boeing 747s in 
response to a deadly accident last year 
the order is the latest in a series of faa directives prompted 
by the feb 24 1989 accident in which nine people were swept to 
their deaths after a united airlines 747 cargo door ripped open in 
flight near hawaii 
the faa estimates it will cost us airlines about 774000 to 
make the changes on the 140 airplanes affected by the order 
under the directive which takes effect may 29 cockpit warning 
devices must be repositioned so they can be seen by both the pilot 
and the copilot the devices must also be made to monitor more 
parts of the doors locking mechanisms 
warning lights are to be hooked directly to the part of the lock 
believed to have been damaged in the united accident currently 
the lights are hooked to pressure relief windows on the cargo doors 
the united accident is believed to have been caused by locks 
that had been damaged unnoticeably by improper handling the faa 
has already required us airlines to reinforce the locks 
we felt the way it was set up was adequate boeing co 
spokeswoman elizabeth reese said friday but we have worked with 
the faa to make this change we want to make sure this never 
happens again 
the agency has no jurisdiction over 640 older 747s used by 
foreign air carriers but they often follow the faas lead

conservation officials on saturday announced 
a renewed drive to save from extinction one of the worlds rarest 
mammals the arabian tahr mountain goat 
the campaign will combine a new captive breeding program and 
continued efforts to protect the animals in the wild said ralph 
daly conservation adviser to omans ruler sultan qaboos 
the remaining arabian tahr are found in the sultanates northern 
hajar mountain range and in mountains in the neighboring united 
arab emirates there are believed to be between 1000 and 2000 of 
the goats left 
the government established the wadi sarin nature reserve to 
protect the goats after hunting them was banned in 1975 mountain 
tribesmen known as mushrafyn or guardians monitor the movements 
of the goats in their remote reserve on 6500foot jebel aswad or 
black mountain 
daly said a breeding program for scientific study of around 14 
tahr is already under way at a captive breeding center it will be 
supplemented by a second breeding program to ensure we have 
animals of different lines he said 
we believe it is vital to broaden the genetic base of the only 
tahr population left in the world said daly 
the goats are related to the chamois and musk ox and their 
preferred habitat is steep northfacing mountains the hajar range 
runs in a crescent from the strait of hormuz in the north to the 
edge of the wahiba sands in the southeast 
the majority of the research work carried out for the government 
has been led by muscatbased british wildlife biologist dr paul 
munton he described the arabian tahr as not a welladapted 
desert dweller but a relic of a more temperature fauna 
the species he said is hanging on to life in the coolest and 
most sheltered parts of the most difficult mountains of arabia 
the goats eat fruit seeds and grasses they are hunted in the 
wild by leopards hyenas and wolves and their young are prey to

the us ambassador to kenya has run afoul 
of president daniel arap moi as the kenyan leader continues to 
resist calls for a multiparty political system 
the ambassador smith hempstone has publicly suggested that 
abolishing oneparty rule would bring greater democracy and also 
result in a better investment climate 
moi who has served unchallenged for 10 years characterizes 
those advocating political change in this east african nation as 
tribalists and traitors 
on friday moi repeated his view that kenya was not politically 
mature enough for a multiparty system while not mentioning 
hempstone by name he hinted at the possiblity of steps against 
foreign diplomats considered to be interfering in kenyas affairs 
in a fundraising speech the president noted embassy personnel 
are allowed to travel freely throughout kenya and said pointedly he 
would not like to restrict those movements 
moi did not specifically mention hempstone but his party issued 
a statement naming the us envoy and declaring we assert as we 
have always done that national interest must never be dictated by 
external forces 
it added kenya is a sovereign state a fact that is not 
negotiable and which cannot be compromised at any cost 
mois ruling kenya african national union has dominated politics 
since independence from great britain in 1963 
hempstone a former editor and columnist for the conservative 
washington times has been highly visible and outspoken since his 
arrival in kenya late last year 
the latest political debate was ignited three weeks ago when an 
anglican bishop henry okullu called for an end to the oneparty 
system and a limit of two fouryear terms for presidents 
since then other critics have taken up the call with their 
demands for change extensively reported by nairobis three 
englishlanguage newspapers 
such public debate is relatively rare in kenya where the 
government has been known to detain its critics 
it comes at a time when a number of other african nations most 
of them former french colonies in west africa have begun to move 
toward multiparty systems 
mois party was enshrined as kenyas only legal party under a 
1982 constitutional amendment on thursday two former cabinet 
members called for repeal of that amendment along with the 
dissolution of parliament and free elections 
one of the two kenneth matiba a former minister for transport 
and communications had been picked up by security police in march 
and held for questioning no charges were ever filed

gorbunov said at an evening news conference that the latvian

ruutel to start immediate coordinated actions on the two republics 
drives for independence 
the 1380 parliamentary vote 50 years after moscow seized the 
three baltic states on the soviets western border put latvia on a 
similar secessionist path with lithuania and estonia

lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene 
says a strong declaration of support by western nations could be 
decisive in bringing the baltic republics independence from the 
soviet union 
mrs prunskienes twoday nonstop crusade for lithuanian 
independence at the white house state department and on capitol 
hill resulted in an inconclusive session with president bush 
but she said friday that she continues to hope that bush and 
other world leaders can yet be persuaded that embracing 
independence for lithuania and its neighbors latvia and estonia 
will not undermine soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and his 
program of political and economic reform 
she said the reluctance of western nations to recognize an 
independent lithuania now is the main factor in the soviets 
refusal to accept her republics secession as an accomplished fact

when opec ministers proclaimed a 15 million 
barreladay production cut to help stabilize oil prices the 
international petroleum market gave them a demonstration of their 
credibility prices fell 
the reaction to the accord reached this past week was in many 
ways predictable key members of the 13nation cartel frequently 
have cheated undercut each other after past agreements and some 
oil intelligence analysts said there wasnt much reason to think it 
would be different this time 
these opec agreements all tend to have a halflife of a couple 
of months said edward krapels head of energy security analysis 
inc a washingtonbased forecasting and consulting company that 
advises clients on oil price trends we expect them to erode 
quickly 
nonetheless krapels and others said it is dangerous to dismiss 
the rhetoric and behavior of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries the singlemost powerful influence on the fuel 
that drives the world economy 
although opecs word cannot necessarily be trusted the cartel 
often has achieved exactly what most of its members want stable or 
higher prices in a market that easily could become submerged in 
more oil than it can absorb 
the fact remains that anytime the price of oil is in the 
teens that is not a natural market price said stephen smith an 
oil analyst for the bear stearns cos investment firm in new york 
someone is not producing 
without any price discipline oil inevitably would tumble toward 
the price it costs the leading opec producers to extract from the 
ground which ranges from 1 to 8 a barrel 
the fundamental problem of the oil business is that theres 
just too much fo the stuff around said krapels 
while suddenly cheap oil may sound desirable it could set off a 
chain reaction of volatility and panic worldwide developing 
countries that rely on oil revenues could default on billions of 
dollars in loans for example the oilproducing areas of the 
united states which are just climbing out of a prolonged 
recession could plunge back into another one 
ministers called the emergency opec meeting in geneva in 
response to a 25 percent drop in crude prices since the beginning 
of this year from more than 20 a barrel down to the 1516 level 
this spring 
although prices recently have edged back up the remote but 
underlying fear remained a production freeforall that would send 
oil back toward the 10 nadir reached five years ago 
much of the most recent drop was attributed to violations of 
selfimposed output limits by three opec members that historically 
have played a crucial role in cartel policy saudi arabia kuwait 
and the united arab emirates 
under this the geneva agreement each member will contribute 
toward reducing the cartels output by about 15 million barrels a 
day bringing it down to roughly 22 million barrels vs 235 
million barrels in april theoretically that would eliminate much 
of the glut that has depressed prices and coincide with the 
seasonally higher demand for oil during the summer 
instead of rallying however the oil market weakened on the 
new york mercantile exchange an important barometer of demand the 
june delivery price of west texas intermediate crude dropped 69 
cents a barrel on the day the accord was reached to 1799 the 
price closed out the week friday at 1798 
some strategists said that despite skepticism about the 
durability of the opec commitment they believed most members 
including the chronic quota violators were worried enough about 
price instability to stay honest for awhile 
i take what opec says with a grain of salt because they 
lie said william randol an international oil specialist at the 
first boston co investment bank in new york nonetheless he said 
opec fear of a price plunge combined with inevitably higher 
demand would strengthen prices eventually 
a clumsy agreement is better than no agreement at all said 
krapels opec even clumsily is pretty effective 
in other business and economic news this past week 
fears of an economic slowdown arose with the labor department 
report that the us unemployment rate climbed to 54 percent the 
highest level in more than year but the stock and bond markets 
found consolation in the jobless figures on the theory that a 
weaker economy will ease pressure for higher interest rates 
more bad news than cars seemed to roll off the assembly lines 
the major domestic automakers reported sharp drops in firstquarter 
earnings primarily because of steep production cuts and weak sales 
in the north american market 
two of the biggest themes of the 1980s takeovers and 
securities fraud received major legal jolts the supreme court 
ruled that corporate mergers can be dismantled through antitrust 
suits brought by private citizens further dampening the takeover 
business separately a federal appeals court nullified a 
securities and exchange commission rule widely used in insider 
trading prosecutions

by the time the government finishes selling 
305 billion in bonds and notes over the next few days wall 
streeters hope the outlook will have brightened for the stock 
market 
the recordsized quarterly auction of treasury securities slated 
for tuesday through thursday has been hashed over for weeks among 
stock and bond analysts 
for a time some observers believed it would compel the federal 
reserve to tighten its monetary policy merely to make sure that a 
decent contingent of bidders from around the world showed up 
in the past few days however the mood in the markets seemed to 
perk up with longterm interest rates already at their highest 
levels since last year around this time 
while hopes increased a bit that rates might be near a turning 
point investors were confronted with a new cause for pause that 
the zigzagging economy might once more be veering in the direction 
of a recession 
the economy is starting to weaken again assert the 
economists david a levy and s jay levy in the latest edition of 
their newsletter industry forecast 
right now many investors are talking about worsening 
inflation and a pickup in the economy three months from now 
recession fears will dominate their thinking and the inflation 
danger will have been all but forgotten 
talk of a pickup in business activity and increasing 
inflationary pressures was abruptly quieted friday when the labor 
department reported that the civilian unemployment rate rose 
twotenths of a percentage point in april to 54 percent 
the figures also showed an increase of 64000 in nonfarm payroll 
employment far less than economists had been expecting 
that presumably didnt bode well for corporate earnings in the 
second quarter and beyond at a time when some forecasters had been 
looking for profits to start pulling out of their recent slump 
nevertheless some analysts say other positive forces are at 
work in the market for treasury securities that shouldnt be 
overlooked for one thing they say an increased emphasis on 
savings over spending in this country has started to ease the 
united statess muchlamented dependency on foreign capital to 
finance its deficit spending 
stock traders seemed willing at least to listen to such 
arguments in the past week the dow jones average of 30 industrials 
rose 6531 to 271036 
the new york stock exchange composite index gained 463 to 
18537 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
added 1063 to 42861 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was up 309 at 34573 
volume on the big board averaged 13990 million shares a day 
against 13559 million the week before 
in recent years observed john connolly at dean witter reynolds 
every major government refunding has become a cliffhanger will 
foreign investors show up or will the auctions be a flop such 
uncertainty breeds higher interest rates 
but more recently connolly contends the trends that helped 
create this situation have shifted 
the savings rate has risen steadily which combined with 
higher incomes has substantially increased the pool of savings at 
the same time the government deficit has abated somewhat 
the numbers are changing and this will eventually affect 
markets he concludes the united states has in the last two 
years made major strides toward financial selfsufficiency

the new owners plan no organizational or product changes they 
said and will honor all existing contracts warranties and dealer 
agreements in the us and canada

manufacturing line of allischalmers corp the company lost 80 
million in 1987 in the midst of the farm recession but narrowed 
that to 88 million last year after cutting costs and laying off

network of about 800 us dealers and continue making gleaner crop 
harvesting combines at a plant in independence mo 
deutzallis with sales of 307 million last year holds a small 
fraction of the us farm equipment market dominated by deere amp 
company and ji case said tobias levkovich an industry analyst 
for smith barney harris upham amp co in new york 
theyre a shell of what they used to be levkovich said 
but he predicted the company could still benefit from a farm 
economy upswing he estimated would last three to five years 
the business right now is very strong levkovich said with 
both sales of large tractors and combines climbing in recent months 
khd had announced the sale thursday in west germany it also 
confirmed it was selling its aerospace technology subsidiary to
