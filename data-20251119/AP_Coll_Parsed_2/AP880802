two prison guards were hospitalized in good 
condition tuesday and three other guards and one inmate were 
treated for minor injuries and released after a 14hour 
hostagetaking ended in the early morning 
the handful of prisoners who had taken control of the 32inmate 
special housing unit at coxsackie correctional facility in greene 
county released the last four of the five guards about 1245 am 
tuesday 
i think they got tired said corrections commissioner thomas 
coughlin i think they felt very strongly that they were in over 
their heads after the initial assaults 
coughlin and gov mario cuomo told a state capitol news 
conference that they believed the incident which began about 1030 
am monday was an unorganized chain of events that escalated 
faster than the inmates intended 
what were dealing with is a mob coughlin said it was a 
bunch of young kids acting as a committee of 32 there was no 
planning there was no organization they knocked an officer down 
they took two other officers nightsticks and they said oh my 
god look what weve done now 
according to corrections department records the oldest inmate 
in the unit is 26 years old and most of the prisoners are in their 
upper teens or early 20s the prison 20 miles south of albany has 
951 inmates 
all the inmates remained locked in their cells tuesday 
according to corrections department spokesman james flateau 
coughlin said investigators hadnt determined how many inmates 
were involved in the uprising if those involved can be identified 
coughlin said he hoped they would be charged 
the inmates were armed with nightsticks he said 
officials have not determined the cause of the uprising but it 
started when an inmate overpowered guard lewis bloom in a 
recreation yard 
on monday flateau said some inmates had been complaining about 
verbal harassment by guards but cuomo said tuesday that the 
uprising was not a response to any specific incident 
guard david pratt 31 of coxsackie was in good condition 
tuesday with abdominal injuries at albany medical center hospital 
said hospital spokeswoman peggy pitcher a guard freed monday 
night warren agostinoni 28 of cairo was in good condition with 
cuts and bruises she said 
bloom and two other guards were released tuesday morning after 
treatment for bruises and cuts and an inmate was treated and 
released for chest and back injuries she said

calling from was published earlier this year by atlantic monthly 
press and about the same time he was named to the american 
academy and institute of arts and letters in a ceremony in new york

please was published in 1976 and was nominated in 1977 for a 
national book award critics praised the power and economy of the 
writing 
in january 1983 carver became the one of the first recipients

taxfree stipend given by the american academy amd institute of 
arts and letters that provides 35000 a year for five years

in the lookingglass world of un 
diplomacy words dont always mean what you think speakers dont 
always say what they mean and the most admired skill is reading 
between the lines 
the most popular pastime is dissecting the statements of 
diplomats deciding what is hardline rhetoric for the benefit of 
people back home and tv cameras here and what really is going on 
what one envoy says on monday is not necessarily what he means 
on tuesday and principle very often is negotiable 
diplomats also know that what is said in the secretarygenerals 
artfilled 38th floor office seldom decides the fate of nations 
but reflects decisons made elsewhere 
in the iraniraq war for example public statements before a 
battery of microphones and television cameras outside un 
headquarters indicate serious problems in the negotiations 
a stumbling block has emerged over direct talks which iraq says 
it wants before a ceasefire and which iran says it wants only 
after a ceasefire 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar counsels patience and 
says he is working on compromises to resolve procedural 
difficulties 
diplomats listen then consider formulas that could accommodate 
both sides despite strident statements very few things are 
immutable here and concessions are part of the game 
there is speculation the secretarygeneral could announce a 
ceasefire date but leave time before it takes effect that could 
please iran 
in the interim diplomats say he could persuade iran to agree 
to direct talks with iraq before a ceasefire takes hold that 
would please iraq 
or the un chief could persuade the five permanent members of 
the security council to guarantee a ceasefire as proposed by 
iraq iraq then might relent in its demand for immediate 
facetoface talks that would please iran and many other nations 
and give iraq its guarantee 
in another scenario iraq could observe a de facto ceasefire 
without any formal acceptance then it wouldnt violate its own 
demand for talks before a ceasefire 
iran says it could favorably consider direct talks at an 
acceptable level after a ceasefire troop withdrawal and 
prisoner exchange 
but does it mean the announcement of a ceasefire or its actual 
implementation thats subject to negotiation 
deciphering statements at the un often requires comparing them 
with statements from the home front 
on july 18 irans revolutionary patriarch ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini said iran would reverse its position and accept security 
council resolution 598 which calls for a ceasefire and other 
measures to end the war 
he said accepting the yearold resolution was like swallowing 
poison 
iran has said it wants an immediate ceasefire and has no 
tactical or other motivations in seeking lasting peace but on 
tuesday iranian president ali khamenei said prospects for and end 
to the 8yearold war were extremely doubtful 
irans deputy foreign minister sowed more confusion over the 
weekend when he said iran has no obstables to direct talks 
after more than a week of separate talks between the 
secretarygeneral and iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati 
and iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz the discussions are moving 
slowly 
both sides proclaim they never will change their positions 
firmly and nobly grounded in the best interests of their people 
but neither iranian nor iraqi envoys appear willing give a simple 
yes or no answer to a simple question 
for example reporters recently asked iranian ambassador 
mohammad jaafar mahallati whether iran would accept direct talks 
if the secretarygeneral requests it 
answer we will do whatever is necessary to implement 
resolution 598 we cooperate fully with the secretarygeneral but 
cannot accept preconditions 
q does that mean you will you meet facetoface with iraq if 
asked to do so by the secretarygeneral 
a our statement speaks for itself 
reporters asked iraqi envoy riyadh alqaysi a former un 
ambassador what iraq would do if the secretarygeneral announces a 
date to begin a ceasefire without direct talks 
a you have heard my statement the answer is included 
therein we will not accept a fait accompli no matter in what form 
or from which quarter it comes 
reporters then asked the secretarygeneral for his reaction 
a fait accompli is french i dont know if he 
understands properly fait accomplis meaning we are 
negotiating for two weeks on the possibility of ceasefire and 
i think fait accompli is a little use of the imagination of 
those who use the word and dont know what it means

two weeks of calm in 
the tanker war is no assurance of peace to american servicemen 
sweltering on barges that serve as us navy bases in the northern 
persian gulf 
by day navy commandos called seals use patrol boats to check 
out dhows and fishing boats that either venture too close or might 
be sowing mines 
at night army helicopters skim over the water in near silence 
observing shipping activity with nightvision gear that reveals 
even the smallest craft in ghostly green detail 
as far as were concerned nothings changed said the 
commander of the barge winbrown 7 a navy officer who identified 
himself only as gary until we hear otherwise well just 
continue to operate as we have been 
winbrown 7 is one of two commercial barges the navy hired 10 
months ago as mobile sea bases to support operation earnest 
will the escorting of 11 kuwaiti tankers given us registration 
and american flags 
the barge bases equipped with communications gear and a variety 
of weapons were conceived as a stopgap after kuwait and saudi 
arabia rejected us requests for land bases 
american officers say a subsequent decline in iranian attacks on 
neutral shipping in the northern gulf demonstrates the barges have 
a deterrence effect far beyond original expectations 
both barges fly panamanian flags and are anchored in 
international waters outside saudi arabias 12mile limit they are 
within 40 miles of farsi island a base used by irans 
revolutionary guards for speedboat attacks on commercial ships 
trading with kuwait and saudi arabia 
attacks around farsi tapered off in late 1987 none were 
reported this year until the weeks before iran announced july 18 
that it would accept a yearold un security council proposal for 
a ceasefire in its 8yearold war with iraq 
no attacks in the persian gulf by either side have been reported 
since the iranian declaration 
us officers say neither winbrown 7 nor hercules the other 
barge farther north has ever been threatened 
an officer on winbrown 7 named alex said the iranians presumably 
know the barges exist since were in their backyard and we 
dont think theyre foolish or stupid 
from what we can determine iran has been unable to lay mines 
or attack shipping to the extent it did before and has had to focus 
its efforts elsewhere he said 
a ring of floating antimissile reflectors around the barges are 
said to generate radar images several times their actual size to 
fool incoming missiles except for those and the guns the barges 
resemble the oil platforms and seagoing derricks that dot the gulf 
officials in washington acknowledged their existence last year 
but navy officers based in the gulf have refused to discuss the 
barge operation its cost or the fact that kuwait pays the bill 
a senior navy officer whose responsibilities include the entire 
persian gulf said barge personnel are so securityconscious that 
nobodys welcome there not even us 
the approximately 200 soldiers sailors and marines on each 
barge get no shore leave during duty tours of 90 to 120 days and 
cannot tell their families where they are or what they are doing 
living conditions are cramped and spartan and temperatures 
usually top 100 degrees but gary the commander said winbrown 7 
has better food than any navy ship 
two chow lines one spicy and one regular meet the needs of 
both the military and about 50 indian and filipino civilian workers 
living aboard he said us officials say the workers are given 
security screenings 
alex described his assignment as out here on the pointy end of 
the stick where its hot its lonely and its hot he said 
recreation sometimes includes swimming in the worlds biggest 
warm water pool 
last week when pentagon officials lifted secrecy enough to 
permit four journalists to visit winbrown 7 for the first time the 
rules specified no last names and no fullface pictures of men in 
sensitive roles 
the reception was coolly polite but some officers could not 
conceal their displeasure that the pentagon was exposing a secret 
operation to journalists 
a lieutenant colonel who commands the army helicopters prefaced 
his briefing with first i want to know why were doing this 
he said publicity might endanger his pilots lives because they 
operate only at night he would not let his men make a daytime 
flight for television cameras 
the helicopters highlyclassified versions of oh58 scout 
aircraft recently replaced smaller mh6 seabats on the barges one 
pilot said the choppers are so stealthy that fishermen and others 
in small craft rarely if ever spot them 
ive watched them pulling in their nets but ive never seen 
them look up he said as far as i can tell they never know 
were here 
journalists were taken on a run in the seals 65foot mark iii 
patrol boat a sign in the cockpit said this operation is so 
secret that even i dont know what im doing

detroit voters turned thumbsdown on 
casino gambling tuesday while republicans statewide chose former 
congressma jim dunn to challenge democratic sen donald riegle 
dunn and robert huber both millionaires spent about 200000 
each trying to attract support for an underdog race against riegle 
a popular liberal who had no primary opposition in his bid for a 
third term 
with 31 percent of the precincts reporting dunn had 80577 
votes or 62 percent to hubers 48744 votes or 38 percent 
the referendum on casino gambling was put on the ballot by 
opponents of the plan championed by mayor coleman young he 
believes casinos can bring desperately needed money into the city 
and help lower its 96 percent unemployment rate 
with 21 percent of precincts reporting a measure to ban 
gambling was winning by 14050 votes or 64 percent to 7793 votes 
or 36 percent 
detroit also had a lively congressional primary fourterm rep 
george crockett was challenged by city council member barbararose 
collins and two lesserknown democratic hopefuls he was the only 
us house incumbent with primary opposition 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
youngs opponents included many of the ministers and church 
members who in the past have formed the core of his constituency 
a saturday rally turned into a public shouting match between 
procasino and anticasino forces and all over the city preachers 
used their pulpits to make one last anticasino pitch on sunday 
casinos have already been rejected twice by voters and it would 
require action by the legislature to legalize gambling anywhere in 
michigan 
huber who was in congress for the 197374 term and jim dunn 
who served in the 198182 term both criticized riegle as too 
liberal for the state 
dunn devoted most of his energy to mending fences with the party 
leaders he publicly criticized during his unsuccessful 1984 senate 
primary race 
huber the more conservative of the two emphasized his 
opposition to abortion as he spent the bulk of his time trying to 
endear himself to the partisans brought into the party by pat 
robertsons presidential campaign

president reagan sees communism on the 
run jimmy carter is concerned about another oil crisis and gerald 
ford worries about an economic time bomb exploding if the 
nations deficit keeps expanding 
they along with former president nixon are among 47 of the 
nations top statesmen and scholars who peer into the 1990s in a 
cautionary mostly conservative guidebook to the future released 
for review monday 
we must not fall into the trap of thinking that a reduction in 
ussoviet tensions means the end of the conflict nixon warns 
in thinking about america the united states in the 1990s 
nixon has the first word and reagan the last in this collection 
of essays that also includes observations by atlanta mayor andrew 
young secretary of state george shultz soviet writer alexander 
solzhenitsyn attorney general edwin meese and three nobel 
prizewinning economists 
the 590page book which goes on sale in september was 
published by the influential hoover institution on war revolution 
and peace 
a similar collection of essays by the think tank eight years ago 
served as a blueprint for the reagan administration according to 
one reader who is quoted in the introduction to the current book 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
despite a few pieces by liberals and moderates most of the 
contributors are conservatives 
physicist and star wars defense advocate edward teller 
former defense secretary caspar w weinberger and former national 
security adviser richard v allen write about the need for strong 
defense special envoy philip habib discusses the worlds trouble 
spots 
other essays focus on foreign policy national security 
international economic issues domestic policy and national purpose 
and philosophical views on peace prosperity and liberty 
reagan claims he succeeded with three urgent foreign policy 
tasks he faced in 1981 to restore the nations economic strength 
and reinvigorate the world economy to rebuild us military 
strength and to restore americas selfconfidence 
reagan sees the world heading into the information age with 
great advances to come in computers and telecommunications that 
will play a large role in opening up communist countries 
he argues it is no coincidence that this new burst of 
innovation has originated in the free nations where knowledge and 
information flow freely 
the communist system faces a dilemma because of information 
technology he says if it allows technology to develop for 
economic growth it risks challenges to the partys monopoly of 
power if it resists modernization for fear of losing political 
control it will fall farther behind 
probably it has no choice he says these regimes will 
find they cannot resist the forces of change and the power of the 
human spirit 
carter warns of threats to civil liberties when wellmeaning 
people look for simple solutions to their problems 
he hopes for improved relations with the soviet union but says 
the united states must be cautious in negotiations with gorbachev 
the united states also must accommodate the burgeoning 
influence of such countries as china japan and brazil he says 
and deal with a more tightly aligned europe that is already 
looking eastward and becoming equivocal about its singular 
commitments to the west 
he said the united states could face another energy crisis in 
the 1990s and must overcome a lackadaisical attitude that is 
now causing a disturbing reversal of our nations domestic 
production and importation of foreign oil 
ford says the nations deepening debt poses a more serious 
problem 
mark my words he writes unless we as a nation face up to 
the facts of fiscal reality and responsibility and the sacrifices 
required to restore it the economic time bomb we are sitting on 
will do us in as surely as any sudden enemy assault 
nixon proposes bolstering american conventional forces in 
europe korea and the persian gulf and argues that the united 
states must take advantage of moscows flagging economic strength 
to improve our own competive position around the world 
he also advises michael dukakis and george bush to campaign for 
a new america recalling that was suggested to him by frances 
charles de gaulle in 1959 
as vice president i could not take advantage of that advice 
for it would appear i was repudiating president eisenhower nixon 
recalled but john kennedy did run on that theme and he won

seoul wants to be a clean green 
municipal machine by the time the summer olympics hit town even if 
it means evicting some slum dwellers and putting a lid on the 
citys worst polluters 
the city seeking to shine during its stint in the limelight is 
in the midst of an enormous spruceup campaign that includes 
curbing its wreckless drivers and urging its restaurant patrons to 
use better table manners 
i find seoul citizens quite cooperative with what the city 
government is doing says seoul mayor kim yongnae 
the south korean capitals 10 million residents are being asked 
to make more than a few sacrifices for the games which run from 
sept 17 to oct 2 
highway use for example will be rationed private cars 
depending on their license numbers will be only allowed to drive 
on odd and evennumbered days during the games 
in the meantime scores of citizens have been cleaning and 
painting to brighten the city and officials say 125000 trees have 
been planted 
highways subways pollution control street lighting flood 
control and housing all have been improved since seoul was chosen 
as the 1988 olympic host seven years ago said researcher kang 
hongbin of the korea national housing corp 
but construction has led to the eviction of about 100000 people 
from slum areas says kim kwangsoo secretarygeneral of the korea 
council of christian urban poor missions the evictions have 
prompted periodic demonstrations 
although not all the redevelopment projects been officially 
linked to the games squatters claim that to some degree the 
international event is behind all the beautification projects and 
the evictions 
kim kwangsoo says there have been evictions from areas near the 
olympic rowing course the field hockey stadium the equestrian 
competition sites and athletes village 
but the mayor said the city cannot leave people in illegally 
built unsanitary housing that may collapse during rainy season 
downpours new housing will be built and housing subsidies will be 
boosted for poor families he maintained in a recent interview 
the overall price tag for the games in this economically 
thriving city about 30 miles from the north korean border is 
generally given as 31 billion 
about 14 billion is money the government is spending on such 
projects as subway and airport expansion and the cleanup of the han 
river which runs through the center of the city 
the rest of the costs are covered by olympic revenue or private 
investment 
a record 12000 athletes from 161 nations are expected along 
with 230000 sports officials specialists and tourists among 
others an estimated 4650 volunteers will work at olympic jobs as 
guides interpreters and custodians 
seoul also wants to clean up its air by closing factories and 
reducing traffic much as los angeles did when it hosted the 1984 
games 
a booklet published by seouls government says industries 
known for polluting the air will be temporarily closed 
subway and bus runs will be expanded to curb private vehicle use 
and companies will be encouraged to give vacations motorists are 
being encouraged to use unleaded gasoline the mayor said 
seoul has been rather notorious for crazy drivers he said 
but efforts are being made to enforce rules and smooth traffic flow 
kim a presidential appointee who has been mayor since december 
said he also expects construction projects to be halted during the 
games to cut down on noise and dust 
the korean press has frequently mentioned questionable 
hygienic standards in restaurants and the prevalent habit of 
diners throwing waste paper on the floor 
the city is demanding cleaner kitchens and restrooms and has 
selected 3000 of the citys some 100000 restaurants as models 
of a sanitary restaurant where foreigners can enjoy koreas 
traditional food 
such restaurants now have signs in korean saying model 
restaurant and kim said eateries will be asked to add foreign 
languages to their menus

here are excerpts from thinking about 
america the united states in the 1990s published by the hoover 
institution on war revolution and peace 
president reagan it is always perilous to try to peer into 
the future but for the statesman this peril is an occupational 
hazard to be successful the statesman must design policies not 
only to meet the needs of today but to anticipate if not shape 
the pattern of tomorrow 
president ford we cannot go on living beyond our means by 
borrowing from future generations or being bailed out by foreign 
investors 
president nixon gorbachev knows that the problems he faces 
will require at least a generation to solve he needs a generation 
of peace if we have only 20 years before a reinvigorated soviet 
union turns its sights on renewed expansion we have no time to 
lose we must think boldly and act boldly we must seek to shape 
the world but we should not seek to remake the world in our 
image 
president carter if present trends are not reversed by 
market forces or strong government action before 1995 twothirds 
of the united states oil will be imported amounting to more than 
12 million barrels per day there is some doubt that this much will 
be readily available to us from overseas a situation that could 
result in competition for scarce supplies substantial increases in

special envoy philip c habib there is no sign that the 
bloody war between iran and iraq will end before 1990 there 
will be periods of greater or lesser action but neither side seems 
capable of a sudden victory even a change in circumstances such 
as the death of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini or economic or military 
sanctions cannot readily resolve the dispute iranian demands are 
unacceptable to iraq and iraqui militay capabilities remain 
formidable and sustainable 
secretary of state george shultz the soviet union will 
remain our central security concern for the foreseeable future 
us military strength our framework of alliances and our other 
security ties remain central to peace in the world but there is 
also emerging a new dynamism in the eastwest relationship 
economist james m buchanan the economic constitution of the 
united states is in disarray in the late 1980s the flaw in 
budget making is in procedure not in policy no amount of 
legislative responsibility will set matters aright alongside the 
deficit regime we sit in fear of a postreagan resurgence of 
envymotivated exploitative marginal tax rates on income we are 
vulnerable precisely because we have not constitutionally defined 
limit on absolute levels of taxation 
president ford the war in vietnam is receding into history 
but some important lessons remain to be learned from it more 
political than military the first is that a government in which 
public opinion really matters cannot conduct sustained overseas 
combat without substantial citizen support and clearly stated 
objectives this is particularly true when open telecommunications 
direct a roundtheclock barrage of gory battle images into 
citizens homes and spread them simultaneously around the world 
president carter it is obvious that one of the most 
challenging opportunities for us is to reduce the level of 
expenditures for armaments among all nations and devote at least a 
portion of these financial resources to alleviate the problems of 
poverty starvation and homelessness and to preventive health care 
both at home and abroad only the united states could successfully 
lead this effort 
president reagan the new soviet leaders say they are open to 
new thinking and that they seek a breathing space internationally 
so they can concentrate on economic reform at home if so our task 
is to make clear their choice to ensure that adventurism has a 
high cost and to maximize their incentives to help resolve those 
regional conflicts rather than persist in the pursuit of military 
solutions 
president nixon if gorbachev stresses the need to solve his 
internal problems we should not be conned into thinking that the 
system has changed or that the threat to the west has ended

noise screeching yelling bellowing 
deskpounding noise 
noise sen william proxmire says is invading political 
discourse 
its inspiration well perhaps it may be the influence of a 
quartercentury of earblasting rock music upon the nations young 
has the age of rock and roll so corrupted our generation with 
noise that only the loudest shouters can win proxmire asked the 
senate on monday 
or perhaps the wisconsin democrat said one can blame 
television talk shows which elevate rudeness to a fine art and 
operate under the rule of never start talking unless you are 
butting in on another speaker 
if two speakers interrupt a third speaker simultaneously and 
all three keep taking then you have the supreme thrill proxmire 
said wth three people taking at once its impossible to hear a 
coherent word let alone a coherent sentence 
more and more people are catching on to this rockandroll 
oratory proxmire told the senate they are finding its a real 
winner content is nothing it doesnt matter whether the speaker 
is logical or ridiculous 
what matters is the loudness the decibels proxmire said 
his own voice rising to a shout 
does the speaker really get your attention he bellowed to 
the several senators on the floor at the time and the galleries 
mostly filled with tourists from around the nation 
does he slam his fist on the table the senator exclaimed 
slamming his own fist on his senate desk 
does he stamp and shout asked the senator doing both at 
the same time 
does his voice range from a roar to a screech and back to a 
roar he asked roaring with the best of them 
does he flail the air with his fists he shouted flailing 
at the empty air next as if it were a punching bag 
does he slap his hands together and keep shouting 
he waved his arms above his head slapped his hands together and 
shouted if he does all of these things the press will call him 
charismatic and more and more people will come to see him and hear 
his noise 
these roaring thoughts on political noise and loudness were 
ignited proxmire said by a recent column on the subject by 
russell baker of the new york times who said anybody who acts 
as though noise were an argument instead of an assault is too far 
behind the times to be rescued 
there are shouters in the senate also 
but proxmire said the place is more often bound by slow and 
sleepy oratorical tradition conducted according to a gentlemanly 
code in which speakers speak of each other as the distinguished 
and the honorable 
the future however may belong to the red hot shouters 
proxmire lamented 
whenever hot emotion and cold reasoning clash hot emotion 
wins every time 
i can just imagine this place 20 or 30 years from now lets 
say in 2010 proxmire said 
the senate chaplain will deliver a rockandroll crowd 
pleasing shouting morning prayer 
the majority and minority leaders lacking the quiet dignity 
of our present leaders will set the pace with a drum beat of 
table pounding shrill rousing rhetoric 
result this body will move from an ignored tv channel to big 
time on tv the bawling baying bellowing clamor and commotion 
of the united states senate will be on the air 
having shouted his hope that the decibel level of political and 
congressional oratory will be reduced proxmire lowered his voice 
and ended his speech quietly 
sen david pryor dark sought recognition and made clear 
proxmires point had struck home 
after the distinguished senator from wisconsins oration he 
said i may deliver my speech in just a little above a whisper

the debt crisis that has engulfed many 
developing countries is striking a blow at us agriculture 
shrinking the available supply of credit to purchase american 
commodities 
high interest rates declining commodity prices and currency 
devaluations in the 1980s have thrust much of the burden of the 
worlds economic problems on heavily indebted developing 
countries says an issue paper produced recently by usdas 
economic research service 
between 1975 and 1987 the total debt of all nonindustrial 
countries rose from 234 billion to about 12 trillion according 
to the authors mathew shane and david stallings it noted a jump 
in debt service payments in the early 1980s from about 12 percent 
of total exports to 25 percent 
latin american debt service payments have climbed from 20 
percent to 40 percent the paper said 
to compound matters commercial banks have withdrawn credit and 
the indebted nations have forced a reduction in imports while 
attempting to spur exports 
these moves to limit imports represent a serious problem for 
us farmers because the developing world represents the fastest 
growing market for agricultural exports 
imports of american farm products leveled off six years ago and 
there has been little change since a marked contrast to the 1970s 
when the developing worlds share of us exports ballooned from 25 
percent to more than 40 percent 
the united states has battled to maintain market share with 
federal programs to stimulate exports the issue paper describes as 
especially effective programs that guarantee credit to overseas 
customers it also points to food aid programs as particularly 
helpful 
nearly 50 percent of all us agricultural exports to the 
problem borrowers were shipped under federal export programs in 
1983 and remained above 40 percent through 1986 the paper said 
among countries that represent major markets for the united states 
about 30 percent of all us farm goods imported received 
government support 
the figure for latin america is 40 percent according to the 
paper while less than 15 percent of those to hong kong south 
korea and taiwan have been financed through such programs

the agriculture department may reinstate 
mexicos eligibility to send beef mutton pork and goat products 
to the united states 
mexico was dropped from eligibility in february 1984 because it 
failed to meet provisions of the federal meat inspection act in 
specific usda said it lacked satisfactory testing for chemical 
residues contained in the meat and species verification programs 
a review team from usdas food safety and inspection service 
has visited mexicos residuetesting laboratory and several of its 
meat plants and fsis is assured that mexicos inspection program 
now meets us standards said lester m crawford fsis 
administrator 
the united states probably will receive no more than 25 million 
pounds of meat a year from mexico or about 003 percent of 
domestic production 
as a result reinstating mexico as a supplier will have no 
effect on either the american industry or consumer prices usda

plants that have been modified genetically and 
their possible effects on agriculture health and the environment 
are the focus of a federal conference set for sept 79 in 
annapolis md 
development and use of genetically modified plants for food and 
other commercial purposes will be a major part of the conference 
sponsored jointly by the environmental protection agency and the 
departments of agriculture and health and human services 
the sponsors have invited government officials and academic 
experts as well as representatives from industry and consumer 
groups and environmentalists there will be presentations by 
authorities in the development of socalled transgenic plants 
the agriculture department said in a statement that a small 
amount of data already is available from field tests of the ability 
of transgenic plants to resist pests and tolerate pesticides the 
plants also are being studied by researchers seeking ways to 
upgrade nutritional characteristics usda said

a frequent critic of federal air traffic 
control efforts says a new government report showing a reduction in 
near accidents is good news but he says the system remains under 
severe pressure 
were all happy to see it but by no means are we ready to 
celebrate sen frank lautenberg dnj chairman of the 
senates transportation appropriations subcommittee said monday 
after the federal aviation administration released its figures 
the faa said there were 518 operational errors by air traffic 
controllers during the first six months of this year an 18 percent 
drop from the 635 recorded in the first half of 1987 
the 366 aerial nearcollisions reported by pilots from january 
through june this year was a 27 percent decline from the 500 
reported during the same period in 1987 
in addition there were 60 reports of aircraft or ground 
vehicles entering active runways without permission during the 
first three months of 1988 27 percent fewer than the 82 tallied in 
the first quarter of 1987 
these numbers combined with the generally downward movement 
in aircraft accident rates in the first half of 1988 indicate a 
continued pattern of improvement in aviation safety faa 
administrator allan mcartor said in a statement 
but lautenberg said the figures showed encouraging numbers 
not satisfactory numbers 
he said a military plane he was in last friday flying to 
teterboro airport in new jersey had to veer off course to avoid 
colliding with another aircraft that his pilot later told him had 
been only 200 feet away 
the system is under strain he said 
the frequency of operational errors in which the required 
spacing between aircraft in flight is violated has been declining 
since the middle of last year 
but the number of aerial nearcollisions has begun declining for 
the first time in about five years faa spokesman john leyden said 
the agency defines a nearcollision as an incident in which two 
aircraft come within 500 feet of each other in flight or when 
flight crews believe a hazard of a collision existed 
public concern about safety in the skies peaked last year 
complaints from passengers surged airliners crashed at the detroit 
and denver airports and a helicopter carrying president reagan 
averted a collision with a small plane near his california ranch 
the government often under prodding from congress has taken 
steps such as hiring additional air traffic controllers changing 
flight procedures around the countrys largest airports and 
requiring expanded use of devices that report an aircrafts 
altitude 
i think we can take some credit for this record of 
improvement mcartor said 
of the aerial nearcollisions 165 of the incidents involved at 
least one airliner or smaller passenger plane down from the 223 
reported in the first half of 1987 
the faa does not yet have statistics available for the second 
quarter of 1988 for incidents in which vehicles enter runways 
without permission

the government should fingerprint truck and 
bus operators or use even more sophisticated identification methods 
to prevent the drivers from getting licenses from more than one 
state a trucking industry leader says 
the president of the american trucking associations thomas j 
donohue criticized the federal highway administration on monday 
for enacting regulations that require only that drivers social 
security numbers and physical descriptions be recorded 
he said he was asking congress to pass legislation that would 
require the government to compile stricter identification 
information such as fingerprints or retinal images under that 
technique distinctive images are made electronically of a persons 
eyes 
it is irresponsible to do anything less than demand new 
technology to solve our problem donohue said at a news 
conference 
some truck and bus drivers avoid losing their licenses after 
various safety convictions such as for drug and alcohol abuse by 
obtaining licenses from several states if they lose one they 
still have others 
the federal highway administration estimates there are 3 million 
to 5 million truck and bus drivers in the country 
a 1986 law now being phased in requires that truck and bus 
drivers obtain special commercial licenses it also makes it 
illegal for a truck or bus driver to have a license from more than 
one state donohue estimated that there are 900000 bus and truck 
operators with more than one license 
donohue said the federal highway administration rules issued 
july 15 have a major flaw because it is easy to obtain several 
licenses illegally 
we all know you can go into any state in the union this 
afternoon and get as many social security numbers as you want he 
said 
donohue whose organization is the largest of the trucking 
industrys trade groups said fingerprinting or retinal imaging 
would cost about 10 million to institute the cost could be borne 
by fees paid for truck and bus drivers licenses he said 
an investment of 10 million or 15 million in a system that 
would keep the few really bad drivers off the road would seem to us 
to be a reasonable thing to do donohue said 
a federal highway administration official said the agency 
believes its current identification system is effective and that 
more advanced techniques may be in place by the 1990s 
richard landis associate administrator for motor carriers said 
the agency will be studying sophisticated identification methods 
over the next two years and could propose new rules by 1990 
donohue said he is asking lawmakers to incorporate his proposal 
into truck safety legislation the house public works committee will 
consider this month under his plan states would have to select a 
sophisticated identification technique by december 1989 and begin 
using the process by october 1993 
donohue said his proposal was supported by 13 other highway user 
and safety groups including the national safety council in 
addition chairman jim burnett of the national transportation 
safety board the federal agency that investigates accidents has 
expressed support for the idea

the possibility of reaping 7 billion in 
windfall profits may lead chemical companies to prolong production 
of compounds that destroy the earths protective ozone shield the 
environmental protection agency fears 
to encourage those producers to find substitutes for 
ozonedestroying chlorofluorocarbon chemicals the agency wants to 
charge fees equal to the windfall earnings the manufacturers could 
get as prices go up in the face of shortages of cfc compounds 
an international treaty calls for a 50 percent reduction in cfc 
production by 1998 and under epas expectations the cfc shortages 
will enable producers to raise prices with no increase in 
production costs the agency estimated the possible windfall at 
18 billion to 72 billion the quicker substitutes are adopted 
the less the windfall 
the agency gave notice monday it was considering other 
approaches auctions of the right to produce and direct regulation 
of certain manufacturing processes that might require other 
chemicals to be used instead 
an official of the office of management and budget said omb 
favored auctions and would press its view 
we think the market ought to be allowed to do its work rather 
than a bunch of bureaucrats like me said robert k dawson 
associate director of omb what is the evidence that we as a 
federal government can allocate production equitably across firms 
the notices accompanied the agencys final promulgation of 
quotas for cfc producers under the 1987 montreal treaty requiring 
the cuts in cfc production 
epa expects enough countries to ratify the montreal treaty for 
it to take effect next jan 1 eleven nations accounting for 
twothirds of world production must ratify six including the 
united states have done so 
the nontoxic nonflammable and longlived cfc compounds are 
used as refrigeration fluids solvents and blowing agents to make 
plastic foams 
cfcs eventually reach the ozone layer 15 miles to 25 miles high 
that blocks the cancercausing ultraviolet rays of the sun there 
the cfcs destroy ozone 
scientists blame cfcs for a roughly 25 percent decline in the 
ozone layer since about 1960 epa says each percent means 43000 
more cases of skin cancer in the united states currently about 
500000 a year and the regulations should prevent 37 million 
early us deaths among people living now and to be born before 
2075 
the five us companies producing cfc compounds are limited to 
their 1986 production during the 12 months starting next july 1 
assuming the treaty takes effect jan 1 they will have to make a 
20 percent cut in 1993 and an additional 30 percent cut in 1998 
eileen claussen acting deputy assistant epa administrator for 
air pollution said epa was not sure it had authority for either an 
auction or a fee the agency concedes a fee might be considered a 
tax that congress would have to enact 
if an auction was judged to be illegal we would have 
nothing we wouldnt be in compliance with the montreal protocol 
she said 
also she said there is a concern about hoarding with big 
companies like automakers able to outbid the thousands of small 
companies that use cfcs 
dawson said omb believed epa had authority to conduct an 
auction neither agency disputes that in theory an auction should 
capture all the windfall for the government because producers will 
bid for production rights up to the point where production doesnt 
meet their profit goals 
john hoffman project officer for the new regulations said 
our concern is the incentive producers might have for keeping an 
existing product in production delaying the switch to harmless 
alternatives 
while higher prices for cfcs and halons will stimulate some 
firms and industries to shift to alternate materials institute or 
increase recycling or produce other products if substitutes are 
not readily available many firms will have little choice but to 
continue to use these chemicals while paying a higher price 
epas notice said 
the five us manufacturers of cfcs are du pont co 
alliedsignal corp pennwalt corp kaiser chemicals co and 
racon inc 
ten other companies import the compounds 
the du pont co does not believe there will be a windfall 
because substitute compounds are being developed quickly said joe 
steed environmental manager for cfcs 
if we can fund development at the rate we think we need well 
be doing well steed said du pont says it will end all cfc 
production about the year 2000 
david doniger senior attorney with the natural resources 
defense council an environmental group said he would challenge 
the regulations in court 
halting ozone depletion requires a virtually complete ban on 
cfcs and other ozonedepleting chemicals even then recovery of 
the ozone layer will take at least a century doniger said

children as young as 3 years old have been 
sexually abused by therapists according to a survey by an american 
psychological association committee 
kenneth s pope a clinical psychologist in los angeles and 
chairman of the american psychological associations ethics 
committee said monday that the committees recent survey of what 
he called distinguished psychologists nationwide disclosed 82 
instances of sexual intimacy between therapists and minor patients 
from the 90 who replied to the survey 24 percent said they 
knew of instances where therapists abused minor patients he 
said five percent said they knew of hearsay accounts 
of the 82 cases reported he said 56 percent of the victims 
were female and the rest were male 
the ages of the male victims ranged from 7 to 16 with a mean 
age of 125 he said among female victims the ages ranged from 3 
to 17 with a mean age of 1375 
pope said the survey results will be published next year 
the survey is the latest attempt by the mental health profession 
to examine itself and to purge its ranks of therapists who take 
advantage of their position to have sexual relations with patients 
a report published in the july issue of american psychologist 
said studies have shown therapistpatient sexual intimacy to be a 
major problem for all major mental health professions despite the 
threat of multimilliondollar malpractice suits censure by the 
profession and in some states new laws that make such practices a 
felony 
this practice sexual intimacy with patients causes deep and 
lasting harm both to the clients and to the integrity of the 
profession said the report in the association journal the 
scope of the problem is extensive 
in a telephone interview pope said studies indicate that an 
average of one of every 10 male therapists has been involved in at 
least one incident of intimacy with a patient he said a 1983 
california study showed that of those therapists sexually intimate 
with patients 80 percent are involved with more than one patient 
indicating a pattern of exploitation 
among female therapists he said the incidence of patient abuse 
is far less about 1 percent to 3 percent 
it is not known how common such sexual exploitation is in other 
professions said pope because no other professional group has 
made such an effort to study and correct the problem but he said 
the apa has expanded its study to include the campuses and clinics 
where students are trained to become mental health workers and 
found that sexual abuse apparently is even more common there than 
in the patientclient arena 
he said anonymous surveys show 13 percent of psychology 
professors or clinical supervisors questioned admit to sexual 
intimacies with psychology students most of the victims are 
female he said one study showed that 25 percent of the women who 
have received doctorate of psychology degrees in the last six years 
admit to sleeping with their professors 
pope said therapy patients are particularly vulnerable to sexual 
advances because during the course of treatment they often come to 
believe they are in love with their therapists 
it is very frequently a normal part of therapy he said 
but therapists are supposed to be trained to resist no matter 
how seductive the patient becomes 
he said sex with patients is always prohibited it is always 
unethical and there is no instance in which this is appropriate 
therapy it is always the responsibility of the therapist to assure 
that there is no sexual act 
pope added that the clients are always the victims it cannot 
be a mutually consenting activity 
most courts now agree with this position he said in the past 
10 years 45 percent of all malpractice awards through the apas 
professional liability coverage have dealt with patienttherapist 
intimacy one case alone involved a damage award of 23 million 
three states colorado wisconsin and minnesota have made it 
a felony for therapists to engage in sex with clients or even 
former clients the maximum penalties include 20year prison terms 
and 20000 in fines 
consent of the client is not a defense american 
psychologist notes 
pope said the psychology profession is doing a terrible job 
in policing itself 
the field needs to do a better job in selection in training 
in identification of therapists who are impaired or who are 
sexually exploitive he said if the field doesnt do that 
then the licensing boards and the courts need to step in

a revised soviet proposal to make a disputed 
siberian radar station inoperable met with swift us rejection 
leaving the future of krasnoyarsk and the 1972 antiballistic 
missile treaty cloudy 
soviet negotiator vladimir kuznetsov presented the proposal to 
make the equipment at krasnoyarsk inoperable to henry cooper his 
us counterpart who rejected it outright a us official said 
monday 
the exchange took place during arms control talks in geneva 
switzerland last month said the official who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
this was the second soviet attempt to settle the dispute over 
krasnoyarsk which president reagan and even some of his american 
critics say is in violation of the 1972 treatys constraints on 
defenses against missiles 
a few days earlier viktor p karpov the soviet foreign 
ministrys top arms control specialist had offered to dismantle 
the facility if the two governments resolved their differences over 
the treaty 
the white house and state department publicly rejected the 
offer the soviets should comply with their abm treaty 
obligations by dismantling the radar without delay and without 
conditions phyllis oakley a state department spokeswoman said 
i am not going to discuss the merits of conditions 
kuznetsov subsequently clarifying the proposal to cooper said 
the soviets were not prepared to level krasnoyarask but only to 
make the equipment inoperable the us official told the 
associated press 
cooper was described as vigorous in rejecting the soviet 
proposition 
the 1972 treaty considered a landmark in the arms control 
process restricts us and soviet defenses on the theory that a 
potential aggressor would be less inclined to launch a nuclear 
attack if the retaliation were apt to be devastating 
reagan is in the process of deciding whether the krasnoyarsk 
radar is a material breach of the accord that in turn could 
clear the way for the united states to go beyond the treaty in the 
us antimissile program known popularly as star wars 
the presidents advisers are split some have suggested he take 
the legal step while others have recommended further diplomatic 
efforts to resolve the krasnoyarsk dispute

city council members voted monday night to 
defy a federal judge who is threatening to bankrupt the city and 
send them to jail unless they endorse a housing desegregation plan 
the 43 vote came at a raucous special meeting in which speakers 
were interrupted cheered and booed the majority voted not to 
endorse a courtordered plan providing for financial and zoning 
incentives to attract developers to build 800 units of affordable 
housing throughout the city 
us district court judge leonard sand has said that if the 
council failed to pass the resolution by monday he would would 
fine yonkers 100 for the first day and would double the fine for 
each day thereafter after 22 days the fines would wipe out the 
citys annual operating budget of 337 million 
in addition sand has threatened to fine each council member 
500 a day if they remained in contempt after 10 days they would 
be jailed sand said 
after the vote mayor nicholas wasiscko said he might call 
another special council meeting later this week and hoped 
meanwhile that the judge would see some good faith in the 
closeness of the vote and would delay the fines 
the rule of law has got to be respected said wasiscko 29 
who won election as an opponent of desegregation but has since come 
to support the courtordered plan 
mob rule whether it is on a street corner or in a city 
council chamber should never be the rule of the day he said 
one person was arrested for disorderly conduct outside the 
meeting where about 300 people congregated on the street which 
was closed off 
during the meeting vice mayor henry spallone the most 
vociferous opponent of the desegregation plan rallied the crowd of 
about 150 by blasting the federal government and the way it runs 
public housing 
the people of yonkers are not guilty of anything the people 
guilty here are the federal government the state the mha 
municipal housing authority and their lies spallone said 
spallone also charged that sand felt himself to be above the 
law the vice mayor also claimed that any vote was illegal because 
he was coerced into voting before a public hearing was held 
another member who voted against the plan council minority 
leader nicholas longo said there should have been a public meeting 
before monday nights vote 
noting that sand lives in an exclusive suburb longo said 
this is a typical case of the hypocrisy of the rich and elitist 
looking down upon those who must work for everything they have 
monday nights meeting was the latest installment in an 
acrimonious dispute that began in 1980 when the justice department 
charged that yonkers had intentionally segregated its housing and 
schools for 40 years 
yonkers with 195000 residents is the states fourthlargest 
city by virtue of its location it also is a town with a split 
personality 
the east side is predominately white middle to upper class the 
home of sarah lawrence college it borders the wealthy towns of 
scarsdale and bronxville the west side is older more industrial 
and mostly black and hispanic it adjoins new york citys poorest 
borough the bronx 
in 1985 sand found yonkers guilty in a landmark decision that 
linked school segregation to housing segregation for the first time 
the citys board of education launched its integration plan in 
1986 that same year sand ordered the city to construct 200 units 
of lowincome housing on the east side and 800 more units of 
housing throughout the city 160 lowincome homes and the rest for 
moderate incomes 
when they campaigned last fall six of the seven council members 
pledged to fight the sand plan but in january under threat of 
fines the council agreed to a consent decree that would allow 
construction to go forward 
the public recoiled residents mobbed council meetings 
screaming for hours on end council members received bullets in the 
mail picket lines formed in front of the judges homes in 
manhattan and pound ridge 
the council flipflopped and sought to appeal the plan the 
us supreme court refused to hear the appeal but the council 
persisted in its opposition 
the threat of fines has special resonance in yonkers which 
required a state bailout to avoid bankruptcy in 1984 and has 
struggled to regain its financial footing the city has seen three 
years of budget surpluses as well as a growing tax base 
susan brewster executive director of the emergency financial

city was found in contempt of court moodys investment co would 
suspend the citys baa bond rating such a move would jeopardize

cypriot president george vassiliou said 
president reagan accepted his proposal of persuading turkey to 
withdraw its troops and turkish settlers from his divided island 
but a white house spokesman disputed that 
vassiliou in an interview after the 30minute white house 
meeting monday said reagan was favorably accepting those 
principles 
cyprus has been divided since a turkish invasion 14 years ago 
vassiliou proposed the demilitarization of the mediterranean 
country and the creation of a federalized republic 
i said it would be beneficial to cypriots turks and greeks 
and act as a stabilizing role in the region he said 
i said cyprus should be cypriot vassiliou said of his 
conversation with reagan the solution of the cyprus problem is 
very simple it depends on the implementation of principles the 
united states believes in that means no foreign troops should be 
in the country and human rights should be implemented 
however white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan did 
not take a position on the turkishcypriot problem but merely had 
endorsed using the united nations auspices to negotiate a 
settlement to the longstanding dispute 
fitzwater said reagan only generally favors withdrawal of 
foreign troops and there was no statement made about the turkish 
troops 
the president has taken that position around the world in 
country after country fitzwater said but what we said in 
there the meeting with vassiliou was that the proper place to 
resolve it was the un 
vassiliou has talks scheduled aug 24 in new york under united 
nations auspices with turkish cypriot leader rauf dentash 
greece and turkey have stepped to the brink of war in recent 
years because of longstanding differences over cyprus and 
oilprospecting rights in the aegean sea 
turkey invaded and seized the northern part of the island in 
july 1974 saying it was protecting the tyrkish cypriot minority in 
the wake of a greekbacked coup by supporters of union with greece 
the 120000strong turkish cypriot community forming 17 percent 
of the islands population established a breakaway state in the 
turkishoccupied area in november 1983 only turkey has recognized 
it 
the reunification of the island is blocked by turkeys refusal 
to implement a series of un general assembly and security council 
resolutions 
these demand the withdrawal of the estimated 30000 turkish 
troops and 50000 mainland settlers brought to northern cyprus 
since the invasion the abrogation of the breakaway move and the 
return of 200000 greek cypriot refugees onethird of the 
population to their homes in the north

the bargeshipping industry group which says 
drought may cost the industry up to 200 million wants the army 
corps of engineers to reexamine a proposal to divert great lakes 
water to the mississippi river if the drought reduces river levels 
further 
were not disagreeing with the corps on whether its needed or 
not said joseph farrell president of the american waterways 
operators but if the diversion proves to be necessary they say 
it wont have any effect 
the industry thinks them wrong 
inland barge and towboat operators already have lost 45 million 
to 60 million since june 15 because of the drought farrell said 
at a news conference monday he predicted they would lose 150 
million to 200 million 20 percent of their annual revenue even 
if conditions do not worsen 
although some smaller barge operators could be forced out of 
business because of losses farrell said he knew of none which have 
folded so far and is unaware of layoffs 
he also said executives of major shipping firms unanimously 
agreed after reviewing loss projections that they would not seek 
government relief in the form of grants loans or a fuel tax 
exemption 
the industry feels that this is one of the risks of 
business he said 
unprecedented lowwater levels are making it impossible to move 
t oload them as heavily and farrell 
said shorter lighter tows are taking twice the usual time to reach 
their destinations 
the effect is on the bottom line he said time is always 
money 
for example he said it now takes 28 to 30 days to make what 
customarily is a twoweek trip pushing grain barges from processing 
plants in minneapolis to new orleans for shipment overseas 
the lower mississippi downriver from the confluence of the 
missouri and the ohio is experiencing the worst problems because 
it has no lockanddam system to hold back water and maintain 
higher levels he said 
the ohio has got locks and dams up and down its length 
because of that the ability to regulate the flow has made that not 
a critical problem farrell said its the same with the 
missouri 
the mississippi at new orleans currently is flowing at a rate of 
90000 cubic feet per second down from the normal rate of 500000 
cubic feet and the corps of engineers does not expect the flow to 
drop further farrell said 
assistant secretary of the army robert page recently denied a 
request to increase diversion of great lakes water through the 
illinois river to the mississippi saying the greater flow would 
raise the level on the river at st louis only six inches to a foot 
not enough to benefit shipping 
we think six inches to a foot at st louis would be a big 
help farrell said we just dont think its needed yet but 
when the time comes if sacrificing an inch on the great lakes for 
six inches to a foot can save the mississippi system i think it 
will be accepted by everybody

a referendum on casino gambling in detroit and a gop senate 
contest between two millionaires highlight michigans ballot today 
while missouri voters decide whether to raise their lottery jackpot 
and make a former first lady the democratic candidate for governor 
missouri democrats aso are expected to nominate rep richard 
gephardt for a seventh term and give farm activist wayne cryts a 
second shot at congress 
kansas also has primaries but there are no statewide races and 
only three congressional contests in the 3rd district gop 
incumbent jan meyers faces charles b bat masterson 73 a 
retired school administrator 
the detroit advisory referendx 
opponents of gambling who want to discourage the legislature from 
legalizing casinos similar referendums showed voters opposed tom 
gambling in 1976 and 1982 
mayor coleman young believes casinos can bring desperately 
needed money into the city and help lower the 96 percent 
unemployment rate a position that has pitted him against the 
ministers and church members who have formed the core of his 
constituency all over the city on sunday preachers used their 
pulpits to make one last anticasino pitch 
michigans hottest statewide race is for the gop nomination to 
challenge democratic sen donald riegle who has no primary 
opposition as he seeks a third term 
robert huber and jim dunn each of whom served one term in 
congress have tried to portray riegle as too liberal for michigan 
voters they have had trouble attracting contributions and both 
have spent more than 200000 of their own money while riegle has 
campaign funds of 4 million 
huber the more conservative of the two has sought to win 
support from the partisans brought into the party by the rev pat 
robertsons presidential campaign and has prominently mentioned 
his antiabortion stand in ads 
aids became an issue in the race last week when dunn said in a 
radio interview that he took a reasonable rational i think very 
responsible approach to the problems that face this nation mr 
huber has said that the reason people have aids is the wrath of 
god punishment from god of homosexuals and drug users 
huber asked about dunns remarks said i dont know whether 
its the wrath of god but if it isnt it should be 
in missouri state rep betty hearnes who calls herself a 
compassionate friend of working missourians is considered the 
democrats best bet for unseating republican gov john ashcroft 
shes expected to face little trouble with her only primary 
opposition lavoy zaki reed a st louis area teacher who is 
making his second bid for governor 
mrs hearnes 61 is the wife of warren hearnes who was 
governor from 196573 if elected she would be missouris first 
woman governor 
gephardt who filed at the last minute for a seventh term after 
dropping his presidential bid faces three littleknown democrats 
in the st louisarea 3rd district 
cryts who gained national publicity in 1981 when he took his 
familys soybeans out of a bankrupt padlocked grain elevator is 
favored to win the democratic nomination for the 8th district 
congressional seat that would entitle him to a rematch with 
republican rep bill emerson who won by 8000 out of 150000 votes 
cast in 1986 
a statewide measure asks voters to remove most spending 
restrictions on the 2yearold lottery a change supporters call 
crucial in light of a 24 million drop in sales during the last 
fiscal year officials say the decline was probably caused by a 
lack of advertising 
currently 45 percent of lottery proceeds must go for prizes 45 
percent to the state and 10 percent for administrative costs 
including advertising 
critics say the prize limit does not allow the lottery to 
compete with neighboring states with higher prize structures the 
amendment would change the prize limit to a minimum of 45 percent 
and lottery officials would like to give out about 50 percent in 
prizes it also would permit the state to spend more on advertising

the reagan administration says it received a 
private message from iran but it didnt include anything that iran 
hasnt been saying publicly about improving relations and the 
united states has not responded to it 
the thrust of it was that they said the same thing in private 
that theyve been saying in public that any improvement in 
relations would require some kind of action to prove us 
interest in improved relations white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said monday 
neither fitzwater nor state department spokeswoman phyllis 
oakley would dwell on the contents of the message fitzwater said 
it did address the issue of the return of iranian assets estimated 
to be worth more than 1 billion that the united states froze in 
the wake of the 1979 takeover of the us embassy in tehran 
fitzwater said the message indicated the united states would be 
expected to move on the assets issue or some other quid pro quo 
kind of movement which we are not prepared to do 
last week hashemi rafsanjani the speaker of irans parliament 
and acting commanderinchief of iranian armed forces said he 
would help obtain the release of american hostages in lebanon if 
the united states returned the assets 
no deals fitzwater retorted at the time reflecting 
repeated official us statements that there would be no 
negotiations with iranian officials for the release of nine 
americans believed held hostage in lebanon by people sympathetic to 
the revolutionary government of the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
fitzwater repeated that stand monday saying we have always 
said that the best signal they can give to new relations and new 
dialogue is to release the hostages but we dont make the direct 
linkage in fact we just simply state they should release the 
hostages 
at the state department mrs oakley said the iranian message 
came late friday through a third party 
we simply said that we had sent a message we had a 
response asked whether the united states had replied to iran 
she said no 
the reagan administration had written a letter to iran 
congratulating the government for accepting un security council 
resolution 598 seeking a ceasefire to the iraniraq war and 
expressing an interest in an improvement of relations 
secretary of state george p shultz said sunday that he is 
willing to meet with his iranian counterpart to discuss an end to 
the iraniraq war terrorism and hostagetaking but not the 
return of iranian assets 
us officials are trying to find an authoritative channel 
for direct talks with iran but shultz said he has not sought a 
meeting with iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati during the 
iranian officials visit to the united nations for peace talks 
the frozen iranian assets include military equipment and some 
funds in american bank accounts 
many of the assets were released in january 1981 as iran freed 
the americans embassy hostages after a 444day ordeal a special 
tribunal in the hague which arbitrated claims by the two 
governments has jurisdiction over the assets that remain frozen 
iran has petitioned that tribunal for return of those assets

of an attack that led to the crash an autopsy report was scheduled 
to be released tuesday 
the maine line tours bus was taking 12 and 13yearold boys and 
their chaperones from camp cedar a private overnight camp on 
sebago lake in western maine on a camping and fishing trip to bar 
harbor when the accident occurred at 1120 am said henry hacker

students in this tiny ozarks town are getting 
ready for their first school dance now that a federal judge has 
ruled that a centuryold ban on such festivities is 
unconstitutional 
i want to get right on the stick and get it rolling said 
16yearold nancy fox president of the purdy senior and junior 
high school council i think most of the kids are excited 
its wonderful added jonathan clayton who graduated from 
purdy high school in may its my dream come true 
clayton and miss foxs parents were among 21 plaintiffs who sued 
the school board in 1986 claiming that the ban was inspired by 
religious beliefs on monday us district judge russell g clark 
agreed but didnt order the school to sponsor dances 
clark whose court is in springfield said the rule in effect 
promoted the religious beliefs of those in purdy who believe that 
social dancing is sinful 
school board attorney ransom ellis jr said that conclusion was 
incorrect although no decision has been made about an appeal 
school board members cited other reasons for the ban including 
potential discipline and drinking problems 
the board whose district has 520 students including about 250 
in the juniorsenior high school could still seek to ban dancing 
for other reasons said william fleischaker an american civil 
liberties union lawyer who helped represent the plaintiffs but 
in my opinion that would be a foolish step 
although dances were banned on school property they have been 
held at a town community center and students have organized 
juniorsenior proms and held them in neighboring communities 
the controversy escalated after the class of 1986 failed to 
persuade the school board to drop the ban and dance supporters 
held a rally like the one in the movie footloose about a 
fictional texas town where dancing was banned 
miss fox said her executive council and its adviser will meet 
soon to plan a dance which she said might be a backtoschool 
celebration 
well draw up a proposal to bring before the administration 
just like we would any other activity miss fox said 
most students are happy the ban has been ruled unconstitutional 
she said 
there may still be students who dont want to dance because of 
their religious beliefs but those who dance and want to dance we 
will have dances for them if all goes well 
clark conducted a fourday hearing for the lawsuit in june in 
his order he granted the plaintiffs request for a symbolic 1 
plus attorney fees 
church leaders in this southwestern missouri town of about 900 
people made no secret of their opposition to the school dances and 
openly lobbied board members at a spring school board election 
antidancing members were overwhelmingly reelected

the city announced plans monday to stop putting 
homeless families into hotels within two years speeding up a 
previous fiveyear commitment 
the announcement by mayor edward i koch came during a 
congressional hearing to determine whether the city was living up 
to a promise to end the use of welfare hotels in exchange for 
congress continued funding for the hotels 
congress is scheduled to vote wednesday on whether to extend the 
program another year 
some political leaders present at the hearing including rep 
bill green rny said the proposal might be an effective 
political move but also might become an unkept promise 
william j grinker commissioner of the citys human resources 
administration told the panel the problem will not be solved we 
will still have homelessness 
under a plan developed earlier this year the city said it would 
stop using the hotels by the end of fiscal year 1993 it was 
projected that 1179 families would still be in hotels and 3906 
families would be in city operated transitional shelters by the end 
of fiscal year 1990 
under the plan announced monday by the end of 1989 some 1991 
families would be in hotels and 2256 families in the transitional 
shelters by the end of 1990 no families are expected to be in 
hotels and 3534 would be in the shelters 
one of the plans key components koch told the panel is that 
we will be providing 2300 more housing authority and hpd 
department of housing preservation and development apartments to 
homeless families over the next two years than we had anticipated 
under the original plan 
koch noted that congress had changed its regulations recently 
allowing the city to give homeless families priority over families 
on waiting lists 
he said the plan would work only if a sufficient number of large 
apartments and shelter units become available and families 
continue to enter and leave the hotel system at the same rate they 
are doing so now and find apartments on their own

a federal judge has given st elizabeths 
mental hospital until friday to submit treatment records supporting 
its conclusion that residential assailant john w hinckley jr 
should be allowed a day trip off hospital grounds 
us district judge barrington d parker on monday granted a 
request by prosecutors for a court hearing on the hospital proposal 
to let hinckley go on a supervised recreational field trip with 
other patients 
hinckley who shot and wounded president reagan and three others 
on march 31 1981 has been held at st elizabeths since 1982 when 
he was acquitted of criminal charges by reason of insanity 
last year the government successfully opposed an attempt by 
hospital authorities to allow hinckley to visit his parents over

motorists who dont like driving around 
with an advertisement for churchill downs on their license tags 
have a new legal alternative 
county clerks have received sets of decals that drivers can use 
to cover up the twin spires that frame kentucky license plates 
some vehicle owners have a very strong feeling about whether 
or not the twin spires should be on there said mark mcdaniel 
spokesman for the state transportation department 
the measure that permits the plates to be altered was passed 
this year by the general assembly and took effect july 15 the move 
was in response to complaints by gambling opponents and those who 
equate the twin spires of the home of the kentucky derby with a 
state promotion of a private industry 
churchill downs president thomas h meeker said the louisville 
track had not pushed to have the spires put on the plate initially 
i can see a situation where there may be people who for moral 
reasons dont particularly appreciate churchill downs and i 
respect their feelings on that meeker said 
but he was less sympathetic of the private industry argument 
because of the part churchill downs and the kentucky derby play in 
the state economy

fire with their 11 foster children but their house was destroyed 
now volunteers touched by the couples opendoor policy for foster 
children are coming to the familys aid 
they plan to start clearing land for a new house today 
mrs mayo the 65yearold pastor of the mecis temple church of 
god and her husband a retired coal miner in his 70s have been 
foster parents to about 100 children over the years including 
those who escaped from the burning house in this town about 45 
miles northwest of birmingham 
so many people have been touched by their lives said joe 
wood who is helping coordinate plans for a new fivebedroom house 
for the mayos and their foster children 
mrs mayo and three other adults evacuated the children during 
thursdays fire but the heat and smoke kept her from going back to 
get her purse 
they may catch me without a drivers license but that is all 
right mrs mayo said 
russell lyons a carbon hill city council member and retired 
carpenter who will take part in the houseraising said she 
deserves anything anybody can do for her 
on monday friends in this town of 2500 people opened an 
account in the bank of carbon hill with 65 to go toward building 
the house 
but wood said a church has pledged the help of a dozen men for 
two weeks in the building work 
wood said the mayos had some insurance but not near enough 
much labor and materials will be donated but wood said if we 
get out for 20000 well be doing real good 
unless the house can be put up in a month the state department 
of human resources might be forced to take the children away 
because of inadequate conditions of their temporary home in a 
nearby house of a relative of mrs mayo 
were going to do our best to put it up in three weeks said 
wood 
he said he does not want to see the children seven girls and 
four boys ranging from age six months to 11 years taken from the 
mayos 
six of those children are in one family and we dont want them 
to be separated he said 
the mayos he said have sent several foster children through 
college 
they live a poor life in order to do it but they make 
something out of these children wood said 
mrs mayo said the children are frightened at the prospect of 
leaving 
she said she cried when one told her dont worry well get 
something else 
i hate for them to see me cry but i did when he said that 
she said the babies dont know what is going on but the older 
ones are scared they couldnt sleep because they have never been 
anywhere else 
johnny lampley said it is time to repay what his grandmother has 
done for him and the children 
she raised me from a little child he said we all love 
her she is the best mother we could have

anglican bishops from throughout the 
world agreed overwhelmingly that the thorny issue of consecrating 
women as bishops and ordaining them as priests should not splinter 
the anglican communion 
they voted monday night for a carefully worded compromise 
resolution that was designed to keep their churches together 
despite deep divisions on the issue 
the bishops representing 70 million anglicans in 164 countries 
said the churches must respect one anothers decisions and 
attitudes and maintain communications with other bishops regardless 
of gender or viewpoint 
the voting by a show of hands was 42328 with 19 abstentions 
the us episcopal church a member of the anglican communion 
and the canadian and new zealand anglicans are considering 
consecrating woman bishops this year they have admitted more than 
1000 women to the priesthood in the past 11 years 
the 27 anglican chuches worldwide are selfgoverning they look 
to the lambeth conference for guidance but the conference which is 
holding its first meeting in canterbury in 10 years cannot give 
them orders 
the extent of the bishops anxiety was shown in a secret ballot 
by 277187 they defeated a call to the churches to refrain from 
consecrating a woman as bishop because of the damage it would do 
to the anglican communion 
the successful compromise was moved by conference participants 
who spent most of the first two weeks of the threeweek gathering 
discussing and drafting it the conference ends sunday aug 7 
the defeated resolution was proposed by archbishop donald 
robinson of sydney australia who wants to keep the priesthood and 
episcopate allmale and who said he wanted the secret ballot 
robinson said a woman bishop was contrary to the explicit 
teaching of the new testament and threatened a fundamental 
breach of scripture faith and order 
south african bishop george swartz of kimberley and kuruman 
supported him swartz said that while the women priests movement 
was right to say that many would be hurt if women were not 
consecrated bishops many more will be hurt if they are 
margaret hewitt of england who attended the conference as a 
member of the anglican consultative council was the only woman to 
speak in the debate 
she opposed women being priests and bishops saying not all 
the women of the anglican communion are convinced that womens 
ordination is acceptable desirable or appropriate the anglican 
communion has seemed for some time to be the anglican confusion 
but bishop edmond l browning presiding bishop of the us 
episcopal church said it would be only a matter of time before 
women are elected bishops in his church 
this robinsons resolution misrepresents what women have 
learned about ministry and what we have learned from these women 
it ignores the maturity we have achieved and the gifts we have been 
given and share he said 
in failing to reflect what we have forgotten and what we have 
learned it invites mischief rebellion and anarchy in so doing 
it would foster what it seeks to avoid it would usher in 
disunity 
bishop of london graham leonard the leading opponent of women 
priests in the church of england said he would vote for the 
compromise because it was realistic and honest 
archbishop of cape town desmond tutu said he supported women 
priests and women bishops but regretted the issue was overshadowing 
questions of justice and poverty 
archbishop of canterbury robert runcie said before the vote that 
whichever way the count went he would take up the compromise 
resolutions recommendation to appoint a commission the commission 
will examine relations between anglican churches and prepare 
guidelines for them once a woman is consecrated bishop 
runcie is spiritual head of the church of england and presides 
over the conference as the world anglican leader 
he warned that even if the conference passed robinsons 
resolution we have no guarantee that all churches will heed it

are 14 classa war criminals including wartime prime minister 
hideki tojo 
in 1985 nakasone visited the shrine in his official capacity as 
prime minister to mark the 40th anniversary of the wars end the 
visit was strongly criticized by china south korea and other asian 
countries that suffered the effects of japanese militarism during 
the war 
last year the government said japan must give appropriate 
consideration to the national sentiment of its neighbors 
yasukuni shrine was established in 1869 to honor japans war 
dead the military used the shrine which was supported by the 
government to promote patriotism and militarism during the war

world war ii japans constitution states that no religious 
organization shall receive any privileges from the state or

inmates complaining of harassment by 
officers at a maximumsecurity prison took five guards hostage 
monday and held them for up to 14 hours before surrendering 
peacefully early tuesday officials said 
the crisis has ended gov mario cuomo said 
four coxsackie correctional facility guards were released at 
1245 am tuesday said cuomo spokesman gary fryer one hostage 
was taken out on a stretcher and the three others walked out under 
their own power he said 
late monday guard warren agostinoni was released 
agostinoni 28 who was taken by ambulance to a hospital said 
correction department spokesman james flateau the guard was listed 
in fair condition at albany medical center with cuts and bruises 
hospital spokeswoman peggy pitcher said 
the other former hostages also were taken there with the most 
seriously injured identified as david pratt 31 pratt was in 
serious condition with abdominal injuires pitcher said the three 
others lewis bloom 41 douglas roberts 37 and john shipley 32 
were in good condition and were being treated for bruises she 
said 
monday evening the inmates allowed the hostages to stand one at 
a time before a window giving prison officials their first look at 
the five guards since they were seized more than nine hours earlier 
flateau said the guards looked to be in reasonably good 
condition but that some appeared to have cuts and bruises he 
said the inmates allowed the guards to be seen as a show of good 
faith i guess 
earlier officials said the 32 inmates believed to be involved 
were armed with homemade knives but flateau said monday night that 
he could not confirm any knives were involved and he said the 
complaints with harassment were no longer being talked about 
flateau said that as of 11 pm the inmates had not given a 
list of demands to prison officials he would not discuss 
negotiations other than to say they were ongoing 
he said the inmates controlled the console that operates their 
units gates and doors which lead to other parts of the prison and 
a recreation yard 
prison superintendent john twomey assisted by a crisis 
intervention team communicated with some of the inmates flateau 
said 
there have not been demands made at this point as much as 
complaints made by the inmates about harassment by guards 
flateau said 
verbal harassment was the complaint they mentioned most 
often food complaints things like that flateau said 
how the takeover occurred was not known flateau said 
the inmates were assigned to the prisons special unit for 
prisoners with disciplinary problems flateau said 
state troopers and local police with rifles blocked the entrance 
of the prison which houses 951 prisoners and is about 20 miles 
south of albany 
all of the prisons roughly 180 guards were called to duty and 
about 40 police officers were sent to the prison all prisoners 
were confined to their cells flateau said 
flateau said the families of the five guards had been contacted 
and members of three of those families were at the prison 
outside the prison guard ralph scott said inmates had been 
warning for weeks that there might be trouble in the last two 
weeks he said prisoners verbal and physical assaults on 
corrections officers had increased 
every so often you hear something might happen and i had a 
feeling something was going to happen scott said 
at a news conference in albany cuomo said he did not think the 
generally crowded condition of new york states prisons contributed 
to the incident because capacity is not a problem at coxsackie

michael dukakis chided rival george bush for 
refusing to address an urban league convention and defended his own 
running mates support of contra aid despite the democratic 
nominees vocal opposition 
i hope you will note whos here and who isnt here dukakis 
told the urban league convention monday night winning a standing 
ovation from the black audience 
dukakis returned home late monday and was spending today and 
wednesday tending to his duties as massachusetts governor before 
resuming campaigning thursday 
the applause dukakis won for the bush line was the loudest of 
his speech which was greeted cordially but not enthusiastically 
he also won loud applause when he mentioned former democratic rival 
jesse jackson who endorsed dukakis at the democratic national 
convention 
dukakis praised jacksons call for common ground and 
promised to march later this month to commemorate the 25th 
anniversary of martin luther king jrs civil rights march on 
washington 
together we can remember the dream dukakis said 
urban league president john e jacob said at the opening of the 
convention that the organization would have to pressure the next 
president on issues such as civil rights and affirmative action 
dukakis disputed that 
if hes elected dukakis said next year the pressure is going 
to come from the president 
there has been increasing pressure on dukakis in recent weeks to 
spell out what he thinks about bentsens support of aid to the 
nicaraguan rebels and the question surfaced again monday as senate 
democrats bentsen among them worked to craft a compromise aid 
package 
no no no dukakis said whether his running mates support 
for contra aid bothered him i didnt pick lloyd bentsen to be a 
clone of michael dukakis we agree on most things but we disagree 
on some 
still dukakis pressed his opposition to contra aid a favorite 
policy of president reagan 
its a failed and an illegal policy and it ought to stop 
dukakis told reporters referring to the peace plan drafted by 
costa rican president oscar arias he said if we had 
enthusiastically supported the arias plan a year ago this mess 
would be over with the war would be over with 
dukakis appearance before the urban league was no accident 
began a week in which the candidate is expanding his effort to win 
the support of black voters his campaign is mailing literature 
about his affirmative action and judicial appointments record to 
nearly 7000 black elected officials 
dukakis told the urban league cramped ideals and the limited 
ambitions of the past seven years have hurt blacks and other 
minorities and said reagan had engaged in reckless spending that 
took money away from more important programs 
dukakis criticized the reagan justice departments record on 
civil rights and promised to appoint an attorney general who will 
enforce the voting rights act and the civil rights restoration act 
and the fair housing act amendments of 1988 
were going to have a president and a vice president who 
understand that affirmative action is an essential part of making 
the american dream come true for each and every citizen in our 
country he said 
bush who will formally accept the gop nomination in two weeks 
declined to address the urban league his campaign said the vice 
president had a scheduling conflict 
dukakis had both good news and bad news on the home front monday 
a preliminary fbi inquiry into allegations the dukakis 
administration acted improperly in placing a prison in central 
massachusetts concluded without charges being filed law 
enforcement sources said the review found no evidence of any 
violations of federal law in the process which had been challenged 
by opponents of the prison plan 
but his administration had to borrow 200 million to pay its 
bills a sign of a continued slump in state revenue collections 
the state also was forced to borrow money through short term 
notes several times in the fiscal year that ended june 30

they had killed or wounded thousands of iranian soldiers 
some fighting and air strikes were reported monday along the 
iraniraq border while unmediated peace talks pressed on in new 
york 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said he would 
announce a ceasefire date as soon as a factfinding team he sent 
to the persian gulf region returns this week and he consults with 
the security council 
the announcement appeared aimed a pressuring iraq into dropping 
its demand that iran agree to direct talks before a truce takes 
effect 
ten days of battles sparked by iraqi offensives followed irans 
announcement july 18 that it would accept a yearold un 
resolution for a ceasefire in the nearly 8yearold war

holy warriors were hanged monday in bakhtaran the provincial 
capital of a western region the rebels attacked last week 
death to the munafiqeen the crowd chanted substituting the 
farsi word meaning hypocrite for the one that means holy warrior 
official news reports described the seven as the remnants of a 
4800member iranian rebel force destroyed in western iran last 
week 
massoud rajavi leader of the mujahedeen khalq said in a 
statement released in baghdad the iraqi capital that the rebel 
attack caused havoc in iran he repeated the claim that the 
rebels reached 95 miles into western iran and killed or wounded 
40000 soldiers 
neither sides claims could be verified because neutral 
observers were not allowed into the area 
tehran radio said an iraqi attack near mehran a town in western 
iran was crushed before dawn monday and 270 iraqis were killed 
iraq did not comment on the claim 
baghdads official iraqi news agency said helicopter gunships

after her refusal to dissect a frog miss graham a vegetarian 
received a zero for that assignment lowering her grade from a to 
b her records also showed that she balked at her teachers order 
the girls lawyers said finding a dead frog in good enough shape 
to serve the purpose would be a problem but they didnt say they 
would appeal the ruling 
if we have to station somebody down at the swamps or wherever 
it is they live to see them die well do it promised school 
attorney joseph arias 
meanwhile a new state law which takes effect jan 1 allows 
students to be excused from lab dissections if they object on 
religious or moral grounds 
miss graham and her lawyers fought to allow her to use models of 
a dissected frog she gained national attention with her fight and 
even appeared in a tv commercial for apple computers demonstrating 
a computer mockup of a dead frog that she said would serve the 
same purpose as a frog corpse 
apple later dropped that commercial because the company said the 
animal rights issue was getting more attention than the computer 
they advertised 
the school objected to models saying they could give miss 
graham an advantage over other students and could jeopardize the 
schools credibility with universities

more than 100 years after stephen brodie 
supposedly took his famous dive off the brooklyn bridge and lived 
to brag about it a paraplegic dangled off the span in a wheelchair 
for a shot at the record books 
ramond masa 40 carrying fireworks and samurai swords lowered 
himself on a rope monday morning from the middle of the bridge and 
dangled 75 feet above the east river for more than an hour 
police finally persuaded him to lower himself further so he 
could be guided on to a police launch 
the cuban refugee who came to the united states in 1969 called 
himself americas no 1 stuntman although it was his first 
stunt masa claimed he had dangled from the 105yearold landmark 
for seven hours 
i planned for three months to do something real crazy to get 
into the guinness record book he said originally he had 
planned to don a ninja costume light six m80 firecrackers and 
hold two 3footlong samurai swords and plunge off the bridge 
but he changed his plans after the two nylon bags of equipment 
made the 75foot leap without him 
masa who lost use of both legs after a shooting in 1977 said 
his making the guinness book of world records would inspire other 
paraplegics they think that because theyre in wheelchairs their 
life is ended he said 
masa was booked on charges of disorderly conduct illegal 
possession of a knife and dealing with fireworks said police 
spokesman sgt john clifford 
masa who also uses the name elshah muhammed elratuli and has 
a minor criminal record dating to 1977 was given a summons to 
appear in court sept 19 
he initially told reporters his name was megaman he handed 
out red white and blue business cards that proclaimed living on 
the edge is my business american no 1 stuntmen 
he said he was dropped off in the center of the span about 
midnight by his brother whom he refused to identify by name 
dragging his wheelchair and bags containing the swords and 
firecrackers behind him masa crawled to the edge of the span 
where he tied a nylon cord used by mountain climbers around his 
waist through the wheelchair and secured it to a 5inch thick 
piece of bridgework he then pushed the wheelchair off the bridge 
and shimmied down the rope after it 
masa said he was not afraid while dangling he was noticed after 
dawn by a tugboat 
according to the legend in july 1886 brodie a 23yearold 
shoeshine man took the leap from the bridge 
reporters were on hand to see what appeared to be a man dive 135 
feet and emerge unscathed from the river however skeptics believe 
that brodie with the help of cohorts threw a weighted dummy into 
the river 
masa expressed no remorse over the rushhour traffic jam his 
stunt caused this is new york they the commuters like the 
excitement on monday morning

trustees of this tiny town faced with a 
new state law that prohibits hiring parttime police officers have 
ordered a ban on crime accidents emergencies and deaths on 
mondays and tuesdays 
those are the marshals days off 
we are really a rather peaceful little town mayor john 
neill said monday admitting that the ban is to call attention to 
the state law that took effect on july 1 
one of the hardest things in the world is to get a bad law 
repealed and we wanted to make the point that the new state law is 
kind of ridiculous 
the law prohibits communities from legally hiring parttime 
officers as hotchkiss has done for years to cover vacations and 
days off for fulltime law officers 
neill said the western colorado town of 780 residents cant 
afford to hire another fulltime officer

leroy horn raises cattle and grows alfalfa at 
his rural central nevada spread but this years harvesting is 
being done by hungry deer that have broken his fences trampled the 
ground and nibbled his hay 
horns ranch is one of scores in nevada where thousands of 
marauding deer have found green fields tempting in this drought 
year a special hunting season has been called to thin their record 
numbers 
the deer come and mow the alfalfa down horn said monday 
ive got 35 acres but they just eat it as fast as it grows 
every year it seems like a few more deer come back 
the nevada department of wildlife has come to the rescue by 
calling an emergency early hunting season to trim the states 
record 250000 deer herd 
twenty antlerless deer tags will go on sale for the area where 
horn lives beginning wednesday with 170 to 200 more available in 
other rural areas to control the deer depredation officials said 
the permits will be good for about two weeks 
additional hunts are likely before the normal october through 
december hunting season said david rice a department spokesman 
this isnt the first time weve had emergency depredation 
hunts rice said but this is pretty bad this year because we 
have a record deer population 
the number of deer is the largest since records began in the 
early 1960s rice said 
opening the hunting season early and in specific problem areas 
is the best way to reduce the deer population when it intrudes on 
ranchers and farmers he said 
even so horn said he doesnt plan to kill a deer ill leave 
that up to the hunters

promiscuity homosexuality and unwanted 
pregnancies are on the rise in shenzhen a district near hong kong 
where most of the factories are funded from abroad a newspaper 
reported today 
the china youth news called the developments serious social 
problems and attributed them to a lack of men in the area 
the report rare for its explicitness was the papers second in 
a week on the lives of the parttime women workers of shenzhen 
the first focused on labor strife in the area one of four 
special economic zones set up by china in 1980 for factories and 
businesses funded partly or wholly by foreign capital it said 21 
strikes broke out in the area in 1986 and 1987 and told of worker 
exploitation making an unprecedented call for a labor law to 
protect workers 
todays report said there were 250000 parttime women workers 
in shenzhen in guangzhou province 
the women are in a particular bind because not being permanent 
residents of the area not many men want to marry them in china 
if a person doesnt have a residence permit for a certain area 
they cannot live there on a permanent basis even if they marry a 
native 
the report said that in one factory a plastic bag enterprise 
the number of parttime women workers outnumber men by 50 to one 
here women are everywhere the paper said so the area is 
now called a womans kingdom 
the paper said that to help parttime women workers some 
districts of shenzhen have set up sports complexes clubs and dance 
halls 
but with their thirst for love and sex the newness of these 
facilities quickly fades it said 
the paper quoted one young woman as saying who isnt willing 
to fall in love after we work all day who doesnt want to lay 
ones head against the chest of a man even if im not married im 
willing 
a psychologist working for the public securuty bureau was quoted 
as saying that the womens hearts are like kindling wood when 
they meet the fire of love the flames will rage 
the paper said that even though most of the women have 
difficulty getting married many are getting pregnant anyway 
in the shekou industrial district the paper said the number of 
unwanted pregnancies jumped from more than 200 in 1985 to more than 
800 in 1987 out of a population of 10000 parttime women workers 
in the nantou industrial area the paper said more than half of 
the divorces were caused because husbands had affairs with 
parttime workers the paper said 
in addition the paper said there is homosexuality and 
prostitution it did not elaborate 
reports on prostitution and homosexuality are almost 
nonexistant in the chinese press even though todays report did 
not go into detail about their extent in shenzhen the report was 
significant in that it raised the issues 
the chinese officially treat homosexuality as an illness 
prostitution which plagued china before the revolution in 1949 
has in recent years been making a steady comeback in some urban 
areas 
the paper said the problem of parttime women workers would not 
be easily solved in shenzhen 
some people say just bring in more parttime men workers 
the paper said but that wont do because the jobs arent 
suitable and there will still be the problem of residence cards 
no matter what the report said this problem wont easily 
go away

pat robertson has completed his 
journey from religious broadcaster to presidential candidate and 
back returning to the christian broadcasting network as cohost of 
the 700 club 
for better or worse the health of this ministry depends on 
this program it is our bread and butter robertson said monday 
after the first broadcast of the revamped program which included 
the introduction of a new cohost sheila walsh a gospel singer 
and songwriter from scotland 
robertson who founded cbn left the network in 1986 to pursue 
his political goals in 1987 when the southern baptist minister 
formally announced his candidacy for the republican presidential 
nomination he installed his son tim robertson as president of 
cbn and one of three hosts of the program 
during that period donations dwindled cbn officials blamed the 
decline on scandals in other television ministries changes in 
the 700 club format and a poor economy in oil states where many 
cbn donors live robertson later said his absence was the reason 
for the drop 
during that time cbn laid off more than 1000 employees about 
half its workforce and cut its operating budget by more than 40 
percent 
ratings for the 700 club also dropped giving rise to the 
format unveiled monday 
gone were the dramatic recreations of religious conversions and 
the public prayers for healing that marked the old program 
robertson said the new formula for the 90minute program will be 
onethird news onethird ministry and teaching and onethird 
lifestyle features 
robertson still plans to campaign for vice president george bush 
during the presidential election 
when i leave that desk he said pointing to the studio desk 
from which he delivers the news and commentary segment of the 
program i am no longer a newsman when im there i will try to 
report the news fairly

in a further crackdown on dissent 
authorities in burma arrested two prominent war heroes for 
allegedly plotting against the weekold government of president 
sein lwin sources said today 
the arrests came as amnesty international the londonbased 
international human rights group criticized the hardline oneparty 
government for arresting up to 25 other opponents in recent days 
the arrests of ta ya and yan nyang who helped lead the fight 
for burmese independence during world war ii is part of an 
apparent government attempt to to root out potential threats 
diplomatic sources in rangoon said 
meanwhile unconfirmed reports from the burmese capital said 
sein lwin was the target of an assassination attempt on friday by 
an assistant who wounded him slightly in the arm then killed 
himself sources said 
the rumors are widespread enough to be taken seriously but we 
cannot confirm them a western diplomat reached in rangoon said 
the official radio rangoon said today that sein lwin had met 
with members of the central organs of power monday and 
delivered a speech 
in other developments western sources said about 500 students 
and some buddhist monks gathered monday at the shwedagon pagoda 
burmas holiest shrine and a traditional center for protest 
also pamphlets have been circulating in the burmese capital 
calling for a nationwide general strike on aug 8 
on monday the official news agency burma acknowledged the 
arrest of the governments most outspoken critic aung gyi and 
nine other people 
the agency said aung gyi and the nine associates were 
arrested on saturday for attacking the state and would be 
punished under criminal law 
aung gyi emerged as the regimes leading critic this year in a 
series of letters decrying economic and political conditions in 
authoritarian burma 
he singled out sein lwin for turning a blind eye to gross 
human rights abuses while overseeing the suppression of student 
riots in march and june hundreds were killed in the violence 
news agency burmas list of those arrested included associated 
press correspondent sein win and a number of aging retired 
military officers who fell out of favor with former leader ne win 
in the 1960s 
the us state department and other sources said they believed 
as many as 25 people may have been arrested in the sweep of 
dissidents that netted aung gyi rangoon has mentioned only the 10 
cited in the official media 
amnesty international has expressed concern over the arrests of 
aung gyi and what it said were 24 of his friends and political 
associates 
amnesty said it believed they may have been arrested for the 
peaceful expression of their nonviolent political beliefs 
at last report they were held incommunicado without charge or 
trial in insein central prison near rangoon it said in a 
statement released monday 
the londonbased international press institute a media watchdog 
group protested the detention of sein win in a letter to sein 
lwin according to peter galliner director of the institute 
ta ya and yan nyang were members of a closely knit group of 
young burmese nationalists known as the thirty comrades or 
thirty heroes 
hoping to rid burma of british colonial rule they sided with 
the japanese in the early stages of world war ii but later fought 
with the allies against japans forces in burma 
their leader aung san negotiated the end of colonial rule and 
would undoubtably have become the countrys first leaders if he had 
not been assassinated in 1947 ne win was also among the thirty 
sein lwin a hardline former military officer took over the 
chairmanship of the ruling burma socialist program party one week 
ago and was named president 
the 77yearold ne win stepped down a few days earlier after a 
26year rule marked by isolationist economic policies and 
intolerance of free speech 
virtually all the countrys institutes of higher learning were 
closed in june they are scheduled to reopen in midaugust 
the unanswered question is whether the students and public can 
translate distaste for sein lwin into action and what response the 
army will have one knowledgeable diplomat said 
this source and others have noted that while sein lwins 
emergence has fueled protest his recent moves have also left his 
opponents with few if any real leaders 
however there is increasing speculation that a sizable number 
of army officers are troubled by recent developments and owe little 
loyalty to sein lwin 
travellers coming from rangoon said there has been some panic 
buying in recent days and the price of basic commodities has 
risen sharply 
the black market rate of the burmese kyat has risen to eight 
times the official rate of 6 kyat for one us dollar

us and filipino negotiators 
unexpectedly resumed talks today on the status of american military 
bases a week after the negotiations broke down in a disagreement 
over compensation 
members of the two negotiating teams met for more than two hours 
at the department of foreign affairs and agreed to meet again on 
wednesday they refused to answer reporters questions 
in a joint statement the sides said they discussed financial 
compensation as well as security around the bases and the issue of 
filipino court jurisdiction over us troops 
the discussion of the compensation issue encompassed a variety 
of economic options and the exchange of views will continue the 
statement said 
before the session a filipino source close to the talks said the 
philippine panel expected the americans to make a new offer on 
compensation for use of the six installations including clark air 
base and the subic bay naval base clark and subic are the largest 
us military bases outside the united states 
earlier today foreign secretary raul manglapus announced the 
resumption of talks but would not tell reporters if any significant 
breakthrough had been made he said only that the situation seems 
to warrant a resumption of the talks 
manglapus the chief philippine negotiator broke off the talks 
one week ago over what he described as american inflexibility on 
the amount of compensation 
the united states currently pays the philippines 180 million 
annually in exchange for the bases sources close to the philippine 
panel said the filipinos wanted the amount raised to 12 billion 
but the americans refused 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
americans were willing to increase compensation only by 360 
million the filipinos at first rejected a us proposal to include 
salaries paid to base workers and purchases of locally manufactured 
goods in the compensation package 
asked whether the filipinos would modify their demand manglapus 
said our position has already been subjected to change and we 
are not about to change it again 
american negotiators headed by ambassador nicholas platt have 
consistently refused to comment on the talks 
but sources close to the talks said the americans were reluctant 
to agree to a drastic increase because of uncertainty over the 
status of the bases after their lease expires in 1991 
any extension of the bases must be under a formal treaty 
ratified by twothirds of the 23member phillipine senate where 
opposition to them is strong 
president corazon aquino whose term expires in 1992 has 
pledged to honor the current agreement but refuses to say whether 
she will support an extension 
in june the philippine senate approved a bill banning nuclear 
weapons and nuclearpowered warships from philippine soil similar 
legislation is pending in the house of representatives filipino 
sources say washington has been lobbying against the bill 
the base negotiations which began four months ago are actually 
a review of a 1947 agreement giving the americans right to operate

radical proiranian shiite moslem group was quoted today as saying 
american hostages may be freed before the us presidential 
election 
sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah previously has predicted that 
the fate of the nine american hostages would be determined during 
or after the nov 8 election 
today an arablanguage weekly quoted him as suggesting for the 
first time that freedom for the hostages may come sooner 
i do not have any detailed information on the hostages issue 
within the context of usiranian relations fadlallah was 
quoted as saying in an interview published by the parisbased 
mostakbal magazine 
but i have a feeling that the problem of the hostages is an 
essential factor in the american presidential election because 
their card will be of no importance after the elections he was 
quoted as saying 
fadlallah is spiritual leader of hezbollah or party of god the 
group is believed to be the umbrella organization for shiite 
militants holding most of the 18 foreign hostages in lebanon 
my feeling is that the american hostages issue will be 
completely resolved just as the issue of the french hostages was 
he was quoted as saying 
the last three french hostages in lebanon were freed may 4 a 
few days before the french presidential election 
fadlallah was quoted as saying the united states and iran were 
bound to normalize relations now that the 8yearold iraniraq war 
is nearing an end

tehran said terry waite the kidnapped envoy of the archbishop of 
canterbury and the other hostages might be released by the end of

released before the end of the year david penman the archbishop 
for melbourne said in canterbury england

the soviet military unveiled its new topsecret 
blackjack bomber to us defense secretary frank carlucci today and 
staged thundering aerial and artillery displays at two bases 
normally offlimits to foreigners 
carlucci spent about 10 minutes in the cockpit of the strategic 
bomber while foreign reporters were allowed within about 50 yards 
of the sleek white jet soviet military brass were clearly 
uncomfortable with the access accorded the visitors and refused to 
tell reporters anything about the plane 
why do you want to know about the bomber why frighten 
people asked col gen boris f korolkov 
he refused to identify the aircraft whose only markings were a 
red star and a no 12 on the tail 
the pentagons reference book soviet military power says the 
plane is the worlds heaviest and largest bomber but does not give 
exact dimensions 
janes all the worlds aircraft a respected british reference 
book says the plane codenamed blackjack by nato is known in the 
soviet union as the tupolev strategic bomber it says the jet is 
177 feet long has a wingspan of 182 feet and weighs 550000 pounds 
the aircraft has been under development for 10 years can travel 
twice the speed of sound has a flying range of 4500 miles and can 
be armed with bombs and cruise missiles according to janes 
no western official had been shown the plane before carluccis 
visit to the kubinka airfield 30 miles west of moscow 
janes and the us defense deparment predicted the blackjacks 
would be deployed this year korolkov said they became operational 
recently 
carlucci first inspected a mig29 fulcrum fighter jet before 
turning to the nearby blackjack as he did two blackjack bombers 
flew overhead in formation in the partly cloudy blue sky and the 
roar of their engines broke the silence of the largely deserted 
airfield 
carlucci inspected the underbelly of the fourengine blackjack 
and then climbed orange stairs into the open bomb bay doors and 
entered the cockpit he told reporters later he could not give 
technical details of the plane but compared it to the b1 bomber of 
the united states in that it can fly at low altitudes and carry 
heavy payloads 
im not a qualified intelligence officer said carlucci a 
former senior official with the cia im not a qualified 
observer they let me sit in the cockpit but i couldnt tell one 
instrument from another 
the american defense chief who arrived in the soviet union on 
monday for a fourday visit said the tour was largely symbolic 
its a way of continuing the dialogue between our two military 
establishments carlucci said 
the soviet military chief of staff marshal sergei f 
akhromeyev climbed aboard a b1 bomber at ellsworth air force base 
in south dakota last month 
at kubinka carlucci also inspected an ilyushin78 tanker plane 
and an mi26 helicopter and was treated to an acrobatic flying 
display by four mig29s 
next it was the armys turn to put on a show for carlucci he 
drove to the taman motorized division headquarters 12 miles to the 
southwest to watch noisy and dusty war games 
soviet defense minister dmitri t yazov the host of carluccis 
visit stood next to his american counterpart on a twostory 
building overlooking a vast field soviet mi24 helicopter gunships 
shot out from behind the buildings guns firing and artillery 
shells bombarded targets in the field spewing grayblack smoke and 
dirt 
its not very comfortable to drive quipped yazov as 
infantry fighting vehicles bumped along the dirt 
after the display carlucci asked yazovs 10yearold grandson 
if he wanted to shoot like the soldiers the grandson oleg losik 
appeared to be too shy to answer 
later oleg wearing a military officers jacket to keep warm 
told a reporter the war games were very interesting and that 
they were only the second hed seen 
on wednesday carlucci heads to the soviet crimean peninsula 
where he will visit the headquarters of the black sea fleet 
among those traveling with carlucci are ron lehman assistant 
secretary of defense and representatives of the joint chiefs of 
staff and state department

israels ambassador to the united states said 
today that the decision by king hussein of jordan to cut his ties 
to the west bank will make the peace process more difficult but 
may not be cast in stone 
moshe arad said on nbcs today show that he believes 
husseins decision is not irreversible in any case it will not 
help the peace process 
while he made the dramatic gesture he left some roads open 
and its premature to decide whether this is a tactical or a 
strategic decision arad said 
the reagan administration meanwhile is sticking to its formula 
for arabisraeli peace talks despite hueesins decision 
the us plan calls for a mixed delegation of jordanians and 
palestinians to negotiate with israel even before husseins 
statement sunday abandoning the west bank to the palestine 
liberation organization the united states had made little progress 
in trying to promote negotiations 
assistant secretary of state richard w murphy who was heading 
toward the middle east already was scheduled for talks in egypt 
israel jordan and syria now he has the added job of seeking an 
explanation from hussein and to determine if prospects for peace 
talks are even dimmer 
in the meantime the state department asserted monday there 
would be no immediate change in the us approach to resolving the 
40year arabisraeli dispute 
our position on how to begin peace negotiations is unchanged 
and we remain actively engaged spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
husseins declaration sunday severed jordans legislative and 
administrative links to the israeliheld west bank that was ruled 
by jordan between 1948 and 1967 israel has controlled the 
territory and the gaza strip since winning a sixday war against an 
egyptianjordaniansyrian alliance in 1967 the population is 
predominantly palestinian arab 
the kings announcement apparently did not take us officials 
by surprise 
we had intimations said one official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity we did not have a text but we had an 
idea in general 
hussein made the speech after a series of moves in which jordan 
seemed to be separating itself from the west bank even though most 
of the palestinians hold jordanian citizenship and us policy in 
the mideast for 21 years has been based on the idea that the king 
wanted to recover the territory 
secretary of state george p shultz who made four trips to the 
region this year pushed for an israeli withdrawal while also 
informing jordan that a total retreat was not in the cards 
murphy is due to fly to the middle east after winding up talks 
today in geneva switzerland with vladimir polyakov the senior 
mideast expert in the soviet unions foreign ministry 
department officials said last week that murphy would like to 
talk to responsible palestinians while he is in the middle 
east but that us policy still prohibited any discussion with the 
plo whose covenant calls for the destruction of israel as a jewish 
state 
husseins detachment from the west bank could be a blow to us 
hopes to set up arabisraeli peace talks the king long has 
supported publicly the unanimous decision of arab governments that 
the plo was the only legitimate representative of palestinians 
still the reagan administration and its predecessors had tried to 
engage him in peace talks over the west banks future 
shultz ran into a roadblock with both hussein and israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir hussein insisted on a commitment in 
advance that israel would give up the west bank and gaza shamir 
refused the israeli leader also opposed a peace conference in 
which the soviet union might have a chance to influence the outcome 
despite the setbacks the united states pursued hussein as a 
force for moderation even after jordan said last week it would 
abandon an assistance program for palestinians on the west bank a 
us official said privately that the move might have been 
calculated to show the plo was incapable of taking over 
with murphy en route to jordan the state department tried to 
strike a positive stance and keep hussein engaged 
we welcome the fact that king hussein in his speech 
underscored jordans commitment to continue in the peace process 
mrs oakley said the jordanian role in a mideast peace process 
remains essential we said repeatedly palestinians also must 
participate at every stage of the process and we hope that they 
will meet this challenge by seeking responsible dialogue with 
israel 
her statement continued its not yet clear what effect 
jordans pronouncements will have on the situation we will 
maintain our close contacts with jordan as well as the other 
involved parties in advancing the peace process 
on a related subject the state department sharply criticized 
israel for arresting a prominent palestinian activist in jerusalem 
on sunday the jailing of faisal husseini 41 followed a speech he 
gave four days earlier calling for a compromise between israel and 
palestinians 
we oppose israels use of administrative detention in the 
occupied territories mrs oakley said we are seeking 
information about the nature of the charges 
if mr husseini acted illegally he should be charged and 
tried in a court with appropriate open judicial processes we 
always encourage palestinians who seek compromise and accommodation 
with israel we think the israeli government also should encourage 
dialogue with palestinians 
in the absence of evidence that husseini is involved in 
illegal acts we believe that the decision to detain him can only 
discourage those palestinians who advocate peace and reconciliation 
with israel the spokeswoman said

nude sunbathing on public beaches is not 
a constitutional right according to a judge who refused to grant 
an injunction that would have reopened an environmentally protected 
area to naturists 
while nudity is the privacy of ones own property and nudity 
in the context of artistic expression may be protected it seems 
clear that nude sunbathing on a public beach is not a right of 
constitutional dimension us district judge ernest c torres 
wrote monday 
the us fish and wildlife service closed a onemile stretch of 
moonstone beach in south kingstown from april 1 to aug 31 to 
protect two species of shore birds the piping plover and the least 
tern 
the new england naturist association sued the federal 
government claiming their constitutional rights were violated by 
the closure which included a narrow strip of beach traditionally 
opened to nude sunbathers 
in this case it is not nude sunbathing that has been banned 
on moonstone beach what has been prohibited is any use of the 
disputed area the judge said 
torres who heard testimony in may said the naturists had 
failed to demonstate a likelihood of success for their case

arms length for 10 years or go to prison 
patrick carl johnson 23 put on uniforms and persuaded bus 
company officials to let him drive buses away from their lots 
sometimes on jaunts of several hundred miles police said 
johnson told police he loves buses so much that he has stolen 
dozens perhaps nearly 100 since 1986 they said 
visiting district judge randy stout on monday banned johnson 
from buses for a decade 
next time you set your foot on a bus or go around a bus you 
can go to prison for 10 years he said

palm beach state attorney official who headed the investigation 
ms hoff 33 admitted to having pilfered several hundred

15000 
department of transportation and state attorneys office 
investigators arrested ms hoff on april 2 as she left the palm 
beach gardens interchange with 844 and 750 toll tickets according 
to valentine

israeli troops shot and killed an 18yearold 
palestinian and wounded four others in clashes in the occupied west 
bank today as arabs closed businesses for a second day to protest 
deportations 
the clash occurred in the west banks largest city of nablus 
where soldiers opened fire after a military patrol was stoned said 
an official at nablus al ittihad hospital 
the victim identitied as alla edin al aghbar was hit by a 
bullet in the stomach the hospital official said 
two other palestinian teenagers were hit in the legs by bullets 
in the same clash today the hospital official said the army said 
it was checking the reports 
in a second incident soldiers shot and wounded two arabs in the 
legs in the town of dura after masked palestinians stoned a patrol 
and tried to prevent arab laborers from boarding a bus to work in 
israel arab news reports said 
the army confirmed the clash but said it had no further details 
the death raised to 236 the number of arabs killed since the 
uprising broke out dec 8 four israelis also have died 
in a move prompted by eight months of palestinian unrest king 
hussein of jordan announced sunday he was severing legal and 
administrative links with the west bank that he ruled until israel 
captured it in 1967 
projordanian palestinians in the territory were angered by the 
move but a majority praised the monarch for ceding control over 
them to the plo the uprising has been led by underground leaders 
tied to the palestine liberation organization 
arabs shuttered their stores and halted public transportation 
today to protest the expulsions monday of eight reputed leaders of 
the uprising in the west bank and gaza strip 
the israeli armys chief prosecutor said the eight palestinians 
were expelled to deter further violence in the territories 
lt col amnon strasnov said on israel army radio that israel 
had no choice but to expel the eight western countries 
including the united states say israels deportation policy 
violates human rights 
this step of expulsion is definitely a deterrent people fear 
it more than lengthy detentions strasnov said 
he added from a legal standpoint they the deportees could 
not have been put on trial there is no acceptable evidence for the 
court 
he did not elaborate but a military official said the eight 
could not be taken to court because the evidence was either 
topsecret or sketchy the official spoke on condition of anonymity 
mondays expulsions brought to 29 the number of palestinians 
deported since the uprising began dec 8 
the deportees six from the west bank and two from the gaza 
strip were flown by helicopter to southern lebanon and then placed 
in waiting taxis taking them further north 
also monday foreign minister shimon peres acknowledged that no 
progress would be made in solving the arabisraeli conflict until 
after the november elections in israel and the united states 
husseins decision was a setback for peres labor party which 
had campaigned for the socalled jordanian option resolving 
the dispute with the palestinians by negotiating with jordan 
but peres suggested jordan could be drawn back into the peace 
process if labor formed the next government the elections will 
determine if the jordanian option is dead or not peres said 
in a related development staterun jordan television cancelled 
weather reports and a palestinian program for the israelioccupied 
territories the televisions news editor said today in amman the 
jordanian capital

additional duty today officials said many of the appointees had 
been accused of spying for the government 
an education ministry official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the fourdecadeold practice of having each public 
school appoint one of its teachers to be responsible for 
maintaining school security was abolished to help promote 
democracy on campuses 
the ministry notified about 4000 public colleges elementary 
and high schools throughout the island monday to dismiss the 
security officers ministry officials said the affected employees 
will retain their jobs as teachers 
many of the security officers have been accused of filing false

an experiment beneath the greenland ice 
sheet has fueled the debate over the existence of a fifth force 
in nature and whether gravity might be more complex than sir isaac 
newton thought 
researchers last year lowered a gravity meter down a 1mile 
hole and found that gravity diminished faster than expected 
indicating a second pull at work and was being reduced as the meter 
descended geophysicist mark ander reported monday at a meeting at 
the los alamos national laboratory 
the strength of the second pull is about onefiftieth that 
conventionally assigned to gravity said ander the force has been 
measured over distances ranging from 1600 to 5500 feet enhancing 
gravity by up to 39 percent 
other experiments have raised the possibility of a fifth or even 
a sixth that either attract or repel objects in contradiction to 
newtons theories the four known forces are gravity 
electromagnetism which holds atoms together the strong nuclear 
force that holds atomic nuclei together and the weak nuclear 
force which causes radioactive decay 
los alamos scientists said their discovery may be the 
theoretical fifth force or a component of gravity 
either way were saying something pretty big something you 
dont say every day in physics ander told the washington post 
were saying we appear to have the cleanest evidence to date of 
something that cannot be explained by newtonian gravity 
a change in the understanding of gravity may help physicists 
formulate a longsought unified field theory to explain all the 
forces of the universe in a single equation it also might lead to 
recalculation of the masses of the stars and planets and new 
estimates of the universes age 
gravity could be more complicated than newton or even einstein 
thought said richard hughes a physicist at los alamos 
newton suggested in 1687 that gravity causes all bodies to 
attract each other and that the attraction increases as the weight 
of the objects increase and the distance between them decreases he 
suggested that gravitational fields should decline slightly as a 
body moves down a shaft but concluded that gravitational 
acceleration is always the same 
australian scientist frank stacey said he found discrepancies 
when he measured gravitational fields in a mine shaft in 1981 he 
reported that the fields dropped off more rapidly than newtons 
conclusions suggested 
newtonian theory says gravity should change in a certain way 
because as a meter goes down there is less matter below it to 
exert a pull 
paul boynton a university of washington physicistastronomer 
reported last year that he had found evidence of a force that would 
make a feather fall ever so slightly faster than an iron ball 
boynton suspended a 3inch metal ring horizontally at the base 
of 400foot granite cliff in the north cascade mountains near 
index wash half of the ring was aluminum the other half 
beryllium both halves had the same mass which is what gives an 
object weight when the object is pulled by gravity 
newtonian theory says the two halves should have been pulled 
toward the cliff equally if only gravity was working the aluminum 
half twisted slightly toward the cliff and the beryllium half 
rotated away suggesting a force acting on the basis of the two 
halves chemical composition 
donald eckhardt of the air force geophysical laboratory reported 
late last year that gravitationalfield measurements made from a 
2000foot tv tower also revealed discrepancies and like staceys 
findings it suggested a force that attracts rather than repels 
ander said the greenland experiment was concluded before 
eckhardt released his findings and that the researchers had not 
expected to find a force that enhances gravitys pull that was a 
big surprise he said 
others working on the greenland project with los alamos were the 
scripps institution at the university of california at san diego 
amoco production co air force geophysical lab and the national 
science foundation 
another experiment is under way in the pacific ocean a few 
hundred miles north of hawaii with gravity measurements two miles 
deep ander said some preliminary results are expected by the end 
of the year 
the team also hopes to test a deep hole in antarctica near the 
soviet unions vostok station during 199091 he said

warning signals along the track could have 
prevented a headon collision of two freight trains that killed two 
crewmen and forced as many as 2000 people from their homes for 
three days an investigator said 
the signal lights had been vandalized after rock island lines 
abandoned the line in 1980 said dennis shaffer vice president for 
marketing of iowa interstate railroad which took over the tracks 
in 1984 
signal lights warn train operators of approaching traffic 
national transportation safety board investigator edward 
dobranetski also said the trains wouldnt have crashed saturday if 
they had followed their schedules we dont know if one left 
early or the other was running late he said 
the railroad shaffer said monday had complied with federal 
railroad administration regulations by operating trains through 
orders transmitted by radio or telephone from dispatchers 
the westbound train was to have cleared the track by 1156 am 
while the eastbound train was not to have left altoona until 
1201 pm dobranetski said federal investigators he said 
planned to check police logs and canvass residents to determine 
exactly when the trains crashed he said 
the tracks just east of altoona in central iowa were to be 
reopened this afternoon officials said 
residents were allowed to return home monday night after 
firefighters spent three days battling burning alcohol from two 
tanker cars they feared might explode said police chief britt 
adair 
the bodies of william peers of des moines and larry buckingham 
jr of winterset were recovered from beneath tank cars which each 
held 20000 gallons of denatured alcohol 
dobranetski also said his team was checking on the hazardous 
materials in the train and the safety devices and operating methods 
used by the railroad 
the highly volatile alcohol kept the situation tense throughout 
the weekend fears of explosion delayed attempts to recover the 
bodies as fires continued to burn from escape valves in the tankers 
one of the cars burned itself out monday but a foothigh flame 
continued to burn on the other until monday night 
federal officials interviewed the two employees on the eastbound 
train who jumped to safety before the collision orville harger 
51 of johnston and dennis schrader of indianola 
dobranetski declined to discuss the interviews the ntsb is not 
expected to issue a ruling on the accidents cause for six to nine 
months 
the crash occurred when the council bluffs to chicago train 
pulling 78 cars collided with the westbound newton to des moines 
train pulling eight cars

george p shultz and four central american 
foreign ministers called for peace and democracy in the region in a 
watereddown declaration lacking the denunciation of nicaragua the 
us envoy had sought 
in fact the document they issued monday during the secretary of 
states eighthour stop did not even mention nicaragua by name 
only at a later news conference was the country named when 
shultz expressed continued us support for the contra rebels who 
after nearly 7 years of war reached a preliminary ceasefire accord 
in march with nicaraguas leftist sandinista government 
shultz flew today to buenos aires argentina the second stop of 
a ninecountry tour of latin america 
the final version of the declaration signed by shultz and the 
foreign ministers of el salvador honduras guatemala and costa 
rica after a threehour meeting called for peace democracy 
security social justice and economic development in the region 
in the statement the parties reaffirmed that authentic 
democracy require among other requisites political pluralism 
freedom of association freedom of the press an impartial justice 
system that guarantees due process an apolitical armed forces an 
honest and open electoral system and respect for human and 
individual rights 
the sandinistas have been criticized for maintaining a political 
monopoly and suppressing dissent and talks with the contras on 
forging a lasting peace have stalled 
senate republican leaders are working on legislation in congress 
which would provide the contras with 27 million in humanitarian 
aid and include an additional 20 million that would be set aside 
for possible new military assistance president reagan has 
indicated he supports such a bill 
the last congressional appropriation for military aid ran out in 
february it has not been renewed largely pending the outcome of a 
yearold regional peace plan that has so far proved ineffective 
shultz said the contras are an important element expressing a 
strong desire for freedom and democracy in nicaragua and we 
continue to support them 
i didnt come here basically to discuss that subject and we 
didnt have very much discussion of it although i certainly hope 
that we will extend funding for the contras 
mondays 10paragraph document differed sharply from an initial 
10page draft that harshly criticized nicaragua as failing to live 
up to the peace plan the five central american presidents signed 
aug 7 1987 
the original draft written shortly after shultzs last visit to 
the four countries was softened at the insistence of guatemala and 
costa rica which apparently felt tough language would encourage 
the sandinistas to adopt an even harder line 
honduras which favors the hard line against nicaragua made 
public some of the criticism of the sandinistas contained in the 
initial draft calling guatemalas and costa ricas attitude 
incomprehensible and strange 
a honduran statement sunday said the original draft criticized 
nicaragua for not separating its army from the governing party and 
denounced subversion against democratic governments by 
nicaragua 
shortly after he arrived in guatemala on monday shultz 
contrasted what he described as democracy and growing prosperity in 
the four nations with nicaragua where he said nine years of 
sandinista rule have virtually destroyed the economy 
in nicaragua president daniel ortega on monday accused the 
united states of trying to encourage antisandinista aggression 
with shultz visit 
we hope that common sense might prevail because to want to 
sign a death sentence against nicaragua because the united states 
wants one would be the equivalent of signing a death sentence 
against central america he said during a ceremony on the 
sandinista air forces ninth anniversary 
ortega expressed hope that these central american 
governments might be sufficiently reasonable and pragmatic so as 
not to fall in the trap that the united states is laying in 
guatemala 
the united states and the four nations shared common goals of 
democracy the rule of law and economic progress but admitted 
problems existed in reaching those objectives shultz told 
reporters shortly after he arrived as he went into a meeting with 
guatemalan president vinicio cerezo 
shultzs 10day trip will also take him to uruguay brazil and 
bolivia and back to central america aug 89 for meetings with the 
presidents of costa rica honduras and el salvador

police today arrested two cemetery 
workers who allegedly damaged the tomb of president corazon 
aquinos husband the presidents spokesman said 
sen benigno aquinos tomb apparently was damaged in hopes the 
vandalism would cause the firing of two security guards with whom 
the cemetery workers had recently had a fight presidential press 
secretary teodoro benigno said 
the vandalism occurred friday and was discovered saturday when 
authorities at manila memorial park cemetery received a telephone 
warning that a bomb had been planted in aquinos concrete tomb a 
military official said 
maj hernando patawaran of the presidential security group said 
the vandals pried loose a slab of concrete from the top of the 
tomb he said explosives experts found no explosives 
workers reinforced the tomb with steel sheets and resealed it 
benigno said the vandalism upset mrs aquino 
the president was very much affected by the news that the tomb 
was vandalized because if there is any tomb in the philippines 
today that draws universal respect and admiration it is the tomb 
of ninoy benigno said ninoy was the former senators nickname 
aquino was shot and killed at manila airport on aug 21 1983 as 
he returned from three years of voluntary exile in the united 
states the murder fueled opposition to president ferdinand marcos 
which culminated in the civilianmilitary revolt that ended his 
20year rule in february 1986 and propelled mrs aquino to power

cardinal john dearden considered one of 
americas most influential roman catholic leaders for his role in 
modernizing church doctrines left behind accomplishments that will 
stand for centuries church officials said 
dearden died from pancreatic cancer monday he was 80 
as time goes by deardens place becomes even greater said 
the rev richard mcbrien chairman of the theology department at 
the university of notre dame he was already perhaps the leading 
catholic bishop when he retired in the last several years his 
reputation has only grown he was a giant 
dearden who headed the archdiocese of detroit from 1959 to 
1981 voted in the elections of two popes and played a major role 
in the second vatican council which from 1962 to 1965 launched 
extensive doctrine changes including departure from the latin 
mass greater emphasis on laypersons roles and fostering greater 
unity among all christians 
his work will be remembered for a long time said michael 
ghering director of communications for the grand rapids diocese 
i think the most important thing right now is for the faithful of 
the diocese to join together and remember him in prayer 
dearden decided to become a priest when he was 16 he joined the 
priesthood in cleveland in 1932 and was a bishop in pittsburgh 
before coming to detroit where he worked to combat discrimination 
and develop programs to help innercity blacks 
while considered liberal by some members of the church he was 
known to others as iron john for his strict adherence to 
traditional church rules and discipline 
dearden officially retired as archbishop of the 12 
millionmember archdiocese in 1980 after suffering a heart attack 
he continued to administer the diocese until may 1981 when he was 
succeeded by edmund szoka who was elevated in june to cardinal 
dearden founded the national conference of catholic bishops and 
was its president from 1966 to 19871 the conference worked to 
adopt vatican ii philosophies in the united states and currently 
addresses social political and economic issues within the context 
of christian principles 
pope paul vi named dearden a cardinal in 1969 
dearden will lie in state at the blessed sacrament cathredral

a second witness in the trial of 
mohammed ali hamadi has linked the defendant to the 1985 hijacking 
of a twa airliner to beirut according to evidence presented in 
court today 
also today court spokesman falk thomas told reporters that 
pilots of the hijacked jet are scheduled to testify in september 
hamadi is charged with air piracy and murder in the june 1985 
commandeering of twa flight 847 to the lebanese capital his trial 
entered its fourth week today 
questioning witness hazma kassin a palestinian chief judge 
heiner mueckenberger read from a police report on kassins 
recounting of a conversation with hamadis older brother abbas 
abbas was convicted in april of kidnapping two west germans in 
beirut in an attempt to force west germany to free his younger 
brother 
quoting the police report mueckenberger told kassim you told 
police abbas told me that mohammed was arrested because he was a 
hijacker of the american airplane abbas said mohammed is to be 
extradited to the united states abbas didnt say how he knew about 
this but i assume that he had heard it from mohammed 
kassim responded it could be that i told that to the police 
are you afraid to repeat it mueckenberger asked 
no but i cant remember now kassim said in the heavily 
guarded frankfurt courtroom 
kassim said he lived in lebanon before coming to germany in 
1979 he now lives in the town of merzig in saarland state near 
the former residence of abbas hamadi 
mueckenberger said police questioned kassim after mohammed 
hamadis arrest in january 1987 but did not specify the date 
last week gaazi yazbeck a lebanese man who lives in west 
germany and knows the two hamadis said that abbas told him 
mohammed had something to do with the hijacking 
he abbas just said it he was sort of bragging yazbeck 
told the court he said the conversation occurred at a bar in 
saarland state a few weeks after the hijacking 
mohammed hamadi who lived in west germany from 1982 to 1984 
has not been asked directly about the hijacking 
flight 847 was seized after taking off from athens on june 14 
1985 and diverted to beirut the gunmen killed us navy diver 
robert stethem and held 39 americans hostage for 17 days 
three other men who were allegedly involved in the hijacking 
remain at large 
mohammed hamadi was arrested at frankfurt airport on jan 13 
1987 after customs officials discovered liquid explosives in his 
luggage 
in a brief exchange today mueckenberger asked hamadi if he had 
been sick the defendant responded i dont want to discuss this 
in public 
thomas later said hamadi has been ill and requested hospital 
treatment when the court recesses for four weeks on aug 9 he

an outdoorsman says an encounter with a 
seemingly friendly black bear that suddenly attacked him has taught 
him a lesson 
i guess i learned that im not as smart as i thought i was 
louis gallian said monday nursing nine long scratches on the left 
side of his face 
ive spent an awful lot of time in the outdoors and know the 
rules and i broke them i made the mistake of feeding a wild bear 
i consider myself a little more educated now 
gallian 51 of reno got the scratches early sunday when a 2to 
3yearold bear took a swipe at him after the two had shared a 
halfhour of eating petting and generally good communication 
he was grunting at me and i was grunting back we were having 
a fairly good time i thought gallian said i was scratching 
him behind his ears patting his head and feeding him 
but when gallian ran out of the bread and raw eggs he had been 
giving the 4foottall 100 to 150pound bear the animal 
apparently became frustrated stood up and took a swing at gallian 
it startled me because i just didnt expect it at all 
gallian said i shook my finger at him and yelled and he finally 
ran off i dont know what would have happened if id have run or 
if his mother had been around 
gallian who had been camping alone drove himself 1015 miles 
into reno for emergency treatment he did not require stiches 
i think ill have scars though gallian said i wont 
forget this 
david rice spokesman for the state wildlife department said it 
was the first bear attack in nevada that he knows of 
the bear was provoked so im not sure if its really an 
attack rice said its not like the bear saw a human and went 
after it but he did hurt mr gallian and thats unusual around 
here

a new aid package for nicaraguas contra 
rebels may include a plan to call congress back into session during 
its election recess if the leftist managua government engages in 
some provocative act majority leader robert byrd said today 
byrd dwva said senate democrats continue to work on a new 
aid package that will send a message to nicaraguan president 
daniel ortega that congress supports the arias peace plan a 
reference to the regional accord worked out by costa rican 
president oscar arias 
it is still my hope that we can develop a consensus that will 
see democrats unite on the aid package byrd said 
byrd said the plan likely will include a provision to bring 
congress back from its august recess should ortega begin some new 
offensive against the contras 
we will not forsake the contras if he ortega elects to 
engage in some provocative act while congress back is turned 
byrd said 
were getting ready to go into a highly political period 
said sen david boren dokla who was among a dozen senators 
scheduled to resume discussions today on the issue 
i think its important to get an agreedon policy everyone can 
live by until we get a new president boren said 
the group was trying to find the magic combination of 
humanitarian and military aid and the timing and conditions for its 
release that could muster broad support among senate democrats as 
well as among republicans and defuse the issue as a political 
weapon 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva said he hoped an 
aid package could be assembled by midweek when it likely would be 
attached to either a supplemental spending bill or a defense 
department money bill 
he said he then would take the democratic plan to senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas and seek a bipartisan 
agreement but he added were not quite there yet 
sen john kerry dmass said a final aid plan might include 
the opportunity for people to be able to have a vote on military 
aid under some circumstances at some point in time 
kerry and other anticontra democrats made clear however that 
they wanted a high threshold for triggering any new arms shipments 
to the rebels 
dole has proposed his own contra aid package which would send 
27 million in new humanitarian aid to the rebels after a current 
humanitarian aid program ends sept 30 
the dole plan also would set aside 20 million for new weapons 
for the rebels but would release that money only if congress 
authorized it in a separate vote 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the reagan 
administration is encouraged that democrats are working on an aid 
proposal and would cooperate to get an acceptable plan 
the congressional dilemma over how to treat nicaragua has been 
exacerbated in recent weeks by growing tensions in the region 
the leftist sandinista government has cracked down harshly on 
internal opposition arresting protesters and shutting down 
dissenting media outlets at the same time the contras have grown 
more intransigent installing a new more hardline political 
directorate 
democrats were searching for an aid formula that would keep the 
contras alive as an opposition force and strengthen their hand in 
negotiations with president daniel ortegas government but would 
not provoke renewed hostilities or be perceived as violating a 
regional peace accord 
yet unanswered are questions of how much aid to provide whether 
it should include new weapons who would have authority to order 
resumption of any arms aid what conditions would trigger the flow 
of weapons and how the aid would be delivered 
the democrats also are seeking to defuse an issue that has 
divided their conservative wing from the party majority the issue 
now divides presidential nominee michael dukakis who opposes 
contra aid from his running mate sen lloyd bentsen of texas who 
has supported it consistently 
although the senate seemed likely to approve some sort of aid 
package prospects for house passage of anything including a 
military component remained clouded 
speaker jim wright said the house would wait to see what 
senators agree on before taking any action 
i still tend to doubt there will be votes in the house to 
resume the war wright said

with information about a man suspected of being an east german spy 
investigators at the bitburg air base 13 miles from the 
luxembourg border asked that the article appear in the stars and 
stripes newspaper said larine barr a spokeswoman for the us air 
force office of special investigations 
ms barr said investigators believe the man known as 
mickei no longer lives in the area and has fled to east 
germany 
according to the brief article on the second page of stars and 
stripes mickei worked as a taxi driver in the bitburg area and 
owned a camping trailer the man often held weekend parties at 
his trailer stars and stripes said it printed a telephone 
number for people to call if they had any information 
it said investigators are exploring the possibility that air

south carolinas largest cash crop 
aromatic golden tobacco leaf went to market today as the 
staccato chant of auctioneers sounded on warehouse floors 
this years crop was expected to bring 160 million in revenues 
overall its one of the best crops weve had in a long time 
said agriculture commissioner les tindal as he surveyed piles of 
tobacco at the growers big 4 warehouse 
warehouses here as well as in mullins lake city and 
darlingtontimmonsville had openingday auctions today auctions 
will be held for the first time this year in loris conway and 
kingstree on wednesday 
observers predicted higher prices in south carolina than last 
years opening day average of 13858 per hundredweight for the 
1987 season 1516 million worth of tobacco was sold 
early prices at the starnew hope warehouse outside lake city 
ranged from 124 to 148 per hundredweight at planters warehouse 
in lake city some tobacco brought as much as 164 
gov carroll campbell stopped by planters warehouse walking 
along the rows of tobacco as the auctioneers and buyers followed 
purchasing leaf 
later campbell criticized antismoking activists for attacking 
the crop which he said pumps 300 million with the ripple effect 
into the south carolina economy 
if some of these people who are screaming and yelling did as 
much to fight illegal things if they shut down the marijuana 
fields and eliminated the dope instead of going and trying to 
beat down something thats legal and has been forever in the united 
states this country would be a lot better off he said 
weve got a good quality crop said dewitt gooden a tobacco 
specialist with the clemson extension service while weather 
conditions havent been ideal this season recent rains have filled 
out the tops of the crop 
there were strong opening day sales on georgiaflorida markets 
last week with prices averaging 13659 per hundredweight thats 
up 870 from last year 
cooler weather than normal during the spring left this years 
crop about a week behind tindal said earlier what we have to do 
now is to convince the growers to leave their crop in the field 
until its fully mature he said 
while there are more acres of soybeans than any other crop 
planted in the state tobacco is stil king in sales said sonny 
smith of the south carolina agriculture department 
tobacco brought in 1561 million last year and soybeans just 
over 91 million

two thousand registered nurses walked off 
their jobs today at six hospitals already trouble by a weekold 
strike by 1700 service workers 
negotiations betwen the hospitals and representatives of the 
california nurses association ended just before midnight monday 
and the strike began at 7 am a cna spokeswoman said 
karen henry chief negotiator for the hospitals said her group 
made a new proposal but cna refused to even submit that economic 
package to a vote 
the hospitals she said asked the association to submit the new 
offer to a vote of its membership before friday and to extend the 
strike deadline until then the new offer included an immediate 7 
percent pay hike for all nurses she said 
however donna hansen of the cna said the offer was 
unacceptable and the hospitals were already 8 percent behind 
other area hospitals in wage 
the nurses are seeking a 13 percent raise that would bring 
salaries to 35000 to 40000 for day shifts they are also 
fighting hospital proposals for 12hour shifts and demanding a 15 
percent differential for night shifts 
we think 12hour shifts are unsafe as a general rule said 
jessie bostelle director of collective bargaining for the cna 
the six affiliated hospitals transferred some intensive care 
patients to other facilities monday and planned to limit surgery to 
emergencies 
the average starting salary for a nurses working in the city for 
affiliated hospitals is 30072 to 37692 for day shifts and 
34583 to 43346 for night shifts according to a spokeswoman for 
the hospitals 
the nurses say that although those salaries are higher than the 
nationwide average of about 28000 they are lower than what 80 
percent of the hospitals in the san francisco bay area pay 
the strike was the first by registered nurses in the city since 
1974 
the six hospitals are childrens marshal hale mount zion st 
francis and st marys in san francisco and seton medical center in 
daly city service workers struck those hospitals and one other a

the plo said today it is calling a special 
session of its parliament to discuss king hussein decision to cut 
jordans legal and administrative links with the israelioccupied 
west bank 
egypt meanwhile called for coordination between jordan and the 
palestine liberation organization in efforts to achieve middle east 
peace 
a statement issued in cairo by foreign minister esmat 
abdelmeguid said husseins announcement sunday did not mean jordan 
was abandoning its role in the quest for a palestinian settlement 
the advancement of the peace process requires a unified 
arab front based primarily on effective jordanianpalestinian 
coordination the statement said 
the director of the plos baghdad office azzam alahmad said 
the organizations central council called for a meeting of the 
400plus member national council within a month the decision was 
made during two days of meetings in baghdad 
the last national council session held in algeria came late 
last year before the palestinian uprising began dec 8 in the west 
bank and gaza strip the central council is the upper branch of the 
bicameral national council 
on monday plo foreign relations chief farouk kaddoumi called 
during a closed central council meeting for the maintenance of 
rights of palestinians living in jordan plo officials said on 
condition they not be identified 
king hussein in a televised speech said he was cutting ties 
with palestinians in the west bank because the plo should be 
primarily responsible for them 
the plo has been leading the uprising in israels occupied 
lands most of the 850000 palestinians in the west bank have 
jordanian passports use jordanian money and worship in 
jordaniansupported mosques 
the israelis do not recognize the plo but moderates among them 
have expressed a willingness to talk peace with a 
jordanianpalestinian delegation 
on saturday hussein dissolved jordans lower house of 
parliament half of the 60 members of the chamber of deputies were 
palestinians from the west bank three days earlier he canceled a 
13 billion development project for the west bank and gaza strip 
in his speech sunday the king said jordan is not palestine 
the independent palsetinian state will be established on occupied 
palestinian land after its liberation god willing 
the plo sources said kaddoumi praised jordans distinguished 
relations with the worlds 5 million palestinians and the plo and 
said these relations will remain 
they said kaddoumi emphasized the importance of maintaining 
all the rights acquired by the palestinian people in jordan 
more than half of jordans residents are refugees or immigrants 
from palestine and there are fears husseins action could lead to a 
loss of some of the rights they now have 
plo officials said plo chief yasser arafat has ordered plo 
officials not to make any public comment on husseins action until 
the executive committee which serves as a cabinet can review the 
possible consequences 
they said arafat had canceled a trip planned to the jordanian 
capital of amman next week 
kaddoumi also was quoted by the plo sources as saying support by 
some arab governments for the palestinian uprising was below 
required levels 
they said he accused syria of undermining the insurrection by 
sponsoring attacks by plo dissident factions on beirut refugee 
camps held by arafat loyalists 
syrias role in the attacks against palestinian camps is clear 
as the sun itself kaddoumi was quoted as saying 
if they the syrians are really after strategic parity with 
israel they should have dropped their antiplo policies 
especially during the uprising 
israel seized the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip from 
egypt in the 1967 middle east war

about 200 police applicants were 
rejected after admitting they used illegal drugs or testing 
positive for illegal drug use a department spokesman said 
a total of 640 people applied to become officers during a recent 
recruitment drive 
urine tests showed that some applicants used cocaine marijuana 
or prescription drugs not issued to them chief john pialorsi said 
monday others admitted during polygraph examinations they had used 
illegal drugs 
the urine samples were tested by the sheriffs office the 
results were verified by an independent laboratory 
sheriff jim mcmillan said he was not surprised that shows you 
just what weve been saying about the drug problem out there he 
said 
but the sheriff said he does not think that drug use is a 
problem among those who already wear police uniforms although the 
department does not test officers for drug use because of 
constitutional questions 
testing of applicants is required by state law

arbitration and other methods of solving 
legal disputes should be explored to save time and money for an 
already overburdened judicial system chief justice william 
rehnquist said today 
state courts must lead the way he told participants at the 
annual conference of chief justices 
they have to be the pioneers in this he said 
rehnquist called such alternatives to civil trials the wave of 
the future 
however rehnquist said alternatives cannot be used in some 
cases such as those involving legal aid and complicated matters 
such as the breakup of the american telephone amp telegraph co but 
can be a solution for the great body of cases 
seventy to 90 percent of all civil cases are settled before 
trial said carl f bianchi administrative director of idaho state 
courts but what is new is the enthusiastic packaging and 
selling of alternatives 
bianchi said there are more than 800 alternative programs around 
the country ranging from statefinanced programs to a canine court 
in los angeles which uses an animal trainer to solve disputes 
between dog owners and plaintiffs 
while half the nations law schools offer courses in dispute 
resolution a harvard law school professor said he believed 
attorneys will not encourage alternatives to trial because that 
results in smaller fees 
the pressure for change is going to come from judges and 
courts and court administrators on the one hand and from clients 
on the other hand said frank ea sander who also is chairman 
of the american bar associatons standing committee on dispute 
resolution 
rehnquist also told participants that a committee of the 
judicial conference of the united states chaired by retired 
justice louis powell has been appointed to look into the review 
process of capital punishment cases 
the committee will try to determine if the combined review 
process of capital sentences in state and federal courts takes too 
much time and whether theres coherence and rationality in the 
process rehnquist said 
rehnquist said the us supreme court ruled 12 years ago that 
capital punishment was constitutional and that he believes courts 
should not stop executions 
the highest judge or justice in each of the 50 states the 
district of columbia puerto rico the virgin islands american 
samoa and guam were invited to attend the fiveday conference

prosecutors today asked a judge to consider 
severing the main irancontra conspiracy counts from oliver l 
norths case and try the former white house aide on obstruction 
false statements and taxfraud charges 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh asked us district judge 
gerhard gesell to put off trial of the three main charges of the 
irancontra indictment if he refuses to relax an aug 1 deadline 
for producing a host of secret documents to the defense 
if the first three counts are severed from the indictment the 
intelligence agencies can continue the process of collecting and 
analyzing their documents to assure completion of any additional 
discovery ordered by the court while north is tried on the other 
charges walsh said in a court filing 
in turning over a number of documents on monday for norths 
inspection the government made a reasonable goodfaith effort 
to comply with the courts order walsh said but the government 
agencies need more time to find the documents covered by the 
judges order the prosecutor said 
failure to comply fully with the order should not result in 
dismissal of the first three counts of the indictment walsh said 
north should be ordered to make a more specific request for 
documents he wants to see the prosecutor added 
walsh said the 13 charges that north lied to congress shredded 
documents illegally enriched himself and committed tax fraud to 
raise money for the contras are ready to be tried on sept 20 as 
originally scheduled by the judge 
the criminal conduct alleged in these counts is discrete and 
the allegations far from involving novel legal theories are 
routine the prosecutor said 
the charges which include allegations that north illegally 
accepted the installation of a 13000 security fence outside his 
home and pocketed 4300 in travelers checks from the contras 
dont involve a wide range of classified documents walsh said 
but unless gesell gives the government more time to produce 
secret documents to the defense walsh said the main charges 
against north could not be tried next month 
those three counts charge that north conspired with former 
national security adviser john m poindexter and arms dealers 
albert hakim and retired air force maj gen richard v secord to 
illegally divert usiran armssale profits to the nicaraguan 
rebels 
in addition to the conspiracy charge the four defendants are 
all charged with wire fraud and theft of government property 
the three charges constitute what walsh has previously 
characterized as the main part of the case against north and his 
three codefendants who will be tried separately 
gesell ordered the government to produce a large quantity of 
secret documents to the defense that he ruled would help north 
establish that he acted with approval of higher authorities 
in a filing last week prosecutors asked that gesell extend the 
aug 1 deadline for production of those documents noting that the 
cia and other government agencies had opposed public disclosure of 
many of the documents 
much of the information called for by the courts july 8 order 
can never be disclosed publicly the need to search it out 
nevertheless now threatens to derail the schedule for trial set 
down by the court walsh said in his pleading last week 
north meanwhile has asked gesell to postpone the trial until 
next march saying his defense team needs more time to study the 
thousands of pages of documents already turned over by walsh 
the defense also contends that trying the case during this 
falls presidential campaign would make it impossible to obtain an 
impartial jury verdict 
at a hearing last week gesell threatened to dismiss the first 
three counts of the indictment unless the government turns over the 
secret documents north needs to defend the charges 
in a recent letter to walsh the cia said that it was willing to 
let north inspect most of the documents covered by his request but 
the agency would not allow their declassification for use at a 
public trial 
walsh conceded in todays filing that the problems of public 
disclosure are formidable and the outlook discouraging but he 
urged the judge to give him a chance to show the documents wouldnt 
further a defense that north acted with approval of higher 
officials in the reagan administration 
the prosecutor said he can prove that no authorized covert 
actions identified in norths supplemental discovery request were 
sufficiently similar to the conduct charged in the indictment to 
lead north to believe that that conduct would be proper 
walsh said he knew of no analogue for the diversion of 
armssale funds charged in the indictment

prisoners are eligible for parole consideration after seven years 
policy allows the board to set future review dates from one to 
eight years in the future

national car rental companies and 
regional companies squared off over fees for fuel and mileage and 
collision damage waivers at a conference intended to draft consumer 
guidelines for the industry 
testimony by representatives of the car rental companies opened 
a fourday meeting of attorneys general from 17 states a national 
association of attorneys general task force is hearing car rental 
officials respond to a preliminary report aimed at eliminating 
misleading and confusing advertising and marketing policies 
regional companies such as alamo and general advertise low 
daily rates with no additional charge for mileage however larger 
companies such as hertz complained that those companies dont 
always advertise other charges such as upfront fuel costs and 
airport fees 
alamo and general responded monday that hertz and other 
companies havent always advertised actual costs to consumers 
particularly those who exceed mileage limits 
they contended that driving hundreds of miles above the limits 
could triple the advertised rate and that some of the larger 
companies charged a service fee of up to 175 times the local pump 
price to refill tanks with fuel 
the companies were also divided on collision damage waivers an 
optional charge that waives a customers liability if the rental 
car is damaged 
hertz thrifty budget and the national association of insurance 
commissioners all support laws eliminating the waiver saying that 
most consumers have auto insurance that covers rental car accidents 
general and alamo oppose attempts to eliminate collision damage 
waivers 
representatives of several rental companies said they generally 
support efforts to force their competitors to disclose more in 
their advertising as long as they all must do it 
partial disclosure is more deceptive than no disclosure at 
all said william e lobeck jr president of thrifty car rental 
of tulsa okla 
kansas attorney general bob stephan is the chairman of the task 
force final recommendations will be presented to the association 
at its national meeting in december

a law under consideration would grant a 
proper funeral to executed leaders of the 1956 anticommunist 
uprising as well as their reburial in marked graves according to 
a weekly publication 
gyula borics state secretary in the ministry of justice told 
the weekly oetlet that under a 1979 decree a regulation was 
revoked regarding the burial in unmarked graves of people who have 
been sentenced to death and executed 
the law apparently never was made retroactive however 
now owing to the humanitarian considerations a ruling might 
be adopted that a proper funeral may take place of the persons 
executed because of their role in 1956 the weekly quoted borics 
as saying in its aug 4 edition 
there has been increasing debate in hungary over whether or not 
to reevaluate the events of 1956 and calls for the rehabilitation 
of imre nagy hungarys leader at the time and others executed 
following the revolt they are buried in unmarked graves 
premier and communist party leader karoly grosz has rejected any 
revision of hungarys assessment of 1956 as 
counterrevolutionary but has said there would be a review of 
how it came about 
some people were said to have been injured when police broke up 
a june 16 demonstration to commemorate the 30th anniversary of 
nagys execution when people called for his rehabilitation but a 
memorial service earlier that day at the cemetery where he is 
believed to be buried was not interrupted 
last week a justice ministry official announced that people 
sentenced for their part in 1956 would be eligible to apply for an 
invalidation of their criminal record

a probe into possibly illegal trading based on 
leaked business week stock tips has prompted the firing of one 
printing worker and suspension of another the first nonwall 
street casualties in the scandal 
rr donnelley amp sons co of chicago announced the disciplinary 
actions monday and said it was continuing to investigate whether 
other members of its staff helped purloin inside wall street 
columns to share with stockbrokers 
donnelley spokesman james m ratcliffe said the fired production 
employee who had worked at the companys printing plant in old 
saybrook conn admitted furnishing advance copies of the columns 
to william dillon a former merrill lynch broker in nearby new 
london who was fired last week 
ratcliffe also said the company suspended a worker in its 
torrance calif plant after cooperating with prudentialbache 
securities inc which fired broker brian callahan from its branch 
in nearby anaheim on friday 
the donnelley spokesman declined to identify either employee 
officials reached by telephone at both plants referred all queries 
to ratcliffe 
what has happened is an object lesson to employees 
ratcliffe said we simply have to reiterate on the plantwide 
level and department by department that this is not to be done 
asked if he expected more dismissals or suspensions ratcliffe 
said i have no reason to think theres another one imminent 
the printing companys action marked the first time since the 
burgeoning scandal surfaced late last month that individuals 
outside the investment business were disciplined 
in addition five more investment firms have acknowledged they 
are investigating trading activity surrounding the columns prior to 
their publication that raised the total number of firms disclosing 
their investigations to at least nine amid reports that more than 
two dozen firms were under scrutiny and increased the likelihood 
that the scandal is more widespread than earlier believed 
mary mcgeachy public relations director for business week 
declined to comment on the donnelley actions calling them a matter 
between the company and its employees securities and exchange 
commission officials also declined to comment in accordance with 
agency policy regarding current investigations 
leaking and using marketsensitive information for trading in 
securities before it becomes public knowledge is loosely referred 
to as insider trading and is a form of fraud under federal law 
business week acknowledged on july 21 that it long had suspected 
leaks of tips in its inside wall street column which regularly 
touts littleknown stocks as good buys 
besides merrill lynch and prudentialbache the hartford conn 
brokerage advest inc has suspended one broker and shearson lehman 
hutton inc says three former brokers from the hartford branch of 
ef hutton group inc also may have been involved before shearson 
acquired hutton earlier this year 
late monday painewebber inc spokeswoman mary anne myers said 
it recently had hired at least two of those former brokers who are 
now the subject of an internal investigation she wouldnt disclose 
their identities or provide further details 
smith barney harris upham amp co confirmed today it also was 
investigating suspicious trading in business weekrelated stocks at 
one of its california offices and had alerted the sec 
in addition the discount brokerages quick amp reilly group inc 
and charles schwab amp co acknowledged monday they were conducting 
internal queries into business weekrelated trading through some of 
their accounts and were cooperating with sec requests for 
information 
integrated resources inc a diversified financial services firm 
headquartered in new york said its lawyers also were investigating 
a possible link to the scandal spokesman david fluhrer said the 
query began in response to a report in the wall street journal that

official permission to resume the groups activities was won 
without concessions 
we have won a victory said juliusz zulawski who was the 
clubs president when the group ran afoul of communist authorities 
in the early 1980s 
it is very important because this happened without any 
concessions on our part zulawski told the associated press in an 
interview 
minister of culture aleksander krawczuk gave zulawski 77 a 
letter monday from the mayor of warsaw authorizing the writer to 
hold new elections for the clubs leadership 
there were no political conditions there will be free 
elections of new club officers probably this september he 
said 
the government suspended the clubs activities in 1981 when 
martial law was imposed and banned it in 1983 charging it had been 
taken over by antigovernment and antisocialist elements 
since the club was banned its offices and official charter have 
been overseen by a government commision 
the commission was removed yesterday and i have full access to 
our office zulawski said 
he declined to speculate on why the government had decided to 
recognize the group again adding that its membership has remained 
the same 
a softening in the government position was signaled in june 
when an official newspaper printed a letter from 150 writers and 
intellectuals demanding the clubs reactivization 
after the government banned the club its members and the 
international pen organization refused to recognize the new 
commission 
zulawski said the international group will recognize the 
reformed club and its leaders 
he said the future of the club is far from certain 
it is impossible to predict whether the government will 
interfere again he said no one knows what will happen

president reagan today directed all federal 
agencies to implement guidelines that bar discrimination against 
employees infected with the aids virus but declined to back his 
aids commissions call for federal antidiscrimination legislation 
that recommendation delivered to the white house by the aids 
panel in june was referred to the attorney general for study 
meanwhile reagan said private and nonfederal groups should 
consider adopting similar policies 
i ask american businesses unions and schools to examine and 
consider adopting education and personnel policies based on the opm 
office of personnel management and centers for disease control 
guidelines reagan said in a statement 
calling aids a public health threat that has touched the lives 
of americans with alarming speed and frightening consequences 
reagan issued what he called a 10point action plan 
these directives will assure compassion toward those with the 
hiv infection provide dignity and kindness in treatment and 
medical care and require that we inform and educate our citizens 
to prevent further spread of the disease reagan said 
he did not appear at a white house briefing where the plan was 
presented by aides moments later he spoke at a ceremony in the 
white house complex honoring senior federal employees 
the official white house response to the aids commissions 597 
recommendations was coordinated by dr donald ian macdonald a 
special presidential assistant and director of the drug abuse 
policy office 
defending the administrations refusal to support the aids 
commissions call for federal antidiscrimination legislation 
macdonald told reporters that 36 states already have similar laws 
moreover he said discrimination is not a problem in new 
york los angeles or san francisco cities with the largest 
populations of people with aids 
macdonald maintained that by calling for governmentwide 
application of opm guidelines for federal workers the president 
clearly puts himself out front in crusading against 
discrimination aimed at people with the aids virus or hiv 
although a little over 65000 people in the united states have 
been diagnosed with fullblown aids federal estimates put the 
number infected with the virus at between 1 million and 15 million 
scientists are increasingly coming to the conclusion that most 
if not all of those infected with the virus eventually will succumb 
to the disease and die unless a cure is found no one has been 
known to have recovered from the disease 
retired navy adm james d watkins the aids commission 
chairman had characterized the panels call for 
antidiscrimination legislation as the keystone for all its other 
recommendations 
at a breakfast meeting with reporters in advance of the white 
house release macdonald acknowledged watkins was not likely to be 
pleased with the administrations failure to heed that call 
watkins was out of the country and could not be reached 
rep henry waxman dcalif reacted angrily to the white house 
announcement saying reagan was stalling on the issue and 
ignoring his own commissions key recommendations 
why are they stalling waxman said in a statement this 
administration has done its best to avoid making even a single 
helpful aids decision in the eight years of the reagan presidency 
they handpick a commission and then dont even have the courage 
to accept its recommendations 
added waxman who is chairman of the house energy and commerce 
health subcommittee we dont need another study what we need is 
leadership and while dr c everett koop the surgeon general 
and admiral watkins have given that once again the president is 
hiding

us defense secretary 
frank carlucci boarded the kremlins new secret bomber and watched 
war games on tours tuesday of two bases that had been offlimits to 
westerners 
the visits to kubinka including the bomber nato calls the 
blackjack and to an army artillery division were unprecedented for 
an american official carlucci said later but did not persuade him 
that the soviets had made moved from an offensive to defensive 
military posture 
we for example have seen no change in force structure nor 
have we seen any change in the resources going into the soviet 
military establishment he told a news conference back in moscow 
the pentagon chief said he would continue seeking a 2 percent 
increase after inflation in the us military budget 
during his visit to the air base 31 miles west of moscow 
carlucci spent about 10 minutes in the cockpit of the longrange 
blackjack bomber foreigners had seen it previously only in 
drawings and reconnaissance photographs 
marshal sergei f akhromeyev the soviet military chief of 
staff inspected a b1 bomber last month at ellsworth air force 
base outside rapid city sd 
soviet military officials were much more forthcoming to carlucci 
than to foreign journalists about the sleek white plane with a 
sharply pointed nose 
they kept reporters and photographers behind a rope barrier 
about 50 yards from the plane and refused to tell them anything 
about it 
why do you want to know about the bomber why frighten 
people asked carluccis host col gen boris f korolkov 
korolkov first deputy commanderinchief of the soviet air 
force refused to identify the aircraft whose only markings were a 
red star and a number 12 on the tail 
soviet military power the pentagon reference book says the 
fourengine bomber is the worlds heaviest and largest but does not 
give dimensions 
janes all the worlds aircraft a respected british 
publication says the plane is known in the soviet union as the 
tupolev strategic bomber is 177 feet long has a wingspan of 182 
feet and weighs 275 tons 
the plane has been under development for 10 years can fly at 
twice the speed of sound has a range of 4500 miles and can carry 
bombs and cruise missiles according to janes 
it and the us defense department had predicted blackjacks 
would be deployed this year korolkov said they became operational 
recently 
carlucci inspected a mig29 fulcrum fighter first then turned 
to the nearby bomber as he did so two blackjacks emerged from 
patchy clouds and roared by 
the american visitor inspected the blackjacks underbelly then 
climbed orange stairs through the open bombbay doors and entered 
the cockpit 
he told reporters later he could not reveal technical details of 
the aircraft but compared it to the b1 in the ability to fly at 
low altitudes and carry large payloads 
im not a qualified intelligence officer said carlucci a 
former senior cia official im not a qualified observer they 
let me sit in the cockpit but i couldnt tell one instrument from 
another 
he said his fourday visit to the soviet union which began 
monday is largely symbolic a way of continuing the dialogue 
between our two military establishments 
at kubinka carlucci also inspected an ilyushin78 tanker plane 
and mi26 helicopter and watched a display of aerobatics by four 
mig29s 
carlucci then traveled 12 miles southwest to the headquarters of 
the taman motorized rifle division to watch war games defense 
minister dmitri t yazov carluccis host stood next to him on a 
twostory building overlooking a huge field of mock battle 
mi24 helicopters flew past the building with guns firing 
artillery blasted targets in the field 
infantry vehicles bounced over terrain pocked with shell craters 
and yazov joked to carlucci its not very comfortable to drive 
another guest was the defense ministers 10yearold grandson 
oleg losik he rode around the taman base on his 64yearold 
grandfathers lap next to carlucci in the back seat of a black 
limousine 
when the games were over carlucci asked oleg if he wanted to 
shoot like the soldiers but the boy appeared too shy to answer 
oleg told a reporter later wearing an oversized military 
officers jacket to keep warm that the war games were very 
interesting and only the second hed seen 
on carluccis schedule for wednesday is a visit to black sea 
fleet headquarters on the crimean peninsula

the state supreme court today reversed one 
conviction of the youngest murderer sentenced to die under new 
jerseys 6yearold capital punishment law but ordered him 
resentenced possibly to death for a second slaying 
the court ruled that marko beys constitutional rights were 
violated when police persisted in questioning him about the slaying 
of 19yearold cheryl alston of asbury park despite his wish to 
remain silent 
because of the improper interrogation the court ruled beys 
confession to beating and strangling miss alston with her bra 
should not have been admitted into evidence the court reversed the 
conviction and sent the case back to the lower court for a new 
trial 
the court also ruled that bey who was 17 at the time of the 
alston slaying should not have been subject to the death penalty 
because he was a minor after the murders the legislature modified 
the death penalty so convicted murderers cannot receive a death 
sentence if they are under 18 at the time of the homicide 
but bey remains exposed to a possible death sentence for the 
murder of carol peniston 46 of asbury park bey turned 18 less 
than two weeks after miss alston died on april 2 1983 and about 
two weeks before murdering mrs peniston 
although the court ruled the conviction for mrs penistons 
murder should stand it reversed beys death sentence for that 
killing because of a trial error but the court ordered him 
resentenced and said he could again receive the death penalty 
were real pleased that the conviction was reversed in the 
alston case we would have been more pleased had the conviction 
been reversed in peniston as well said beys attorney judith 
borman 
citing a recent decision by the us supreme court the state 
court ruled that instructions given the jury could have prompted 
them unfairly to dismiss factors about bey that may have caused 
them to be more lenient 
in death penalty cases juries first decide the guilt or 
innocence of the defendant if guilty a sentencing phase is held 
during which defense lawyers present evidence of mitigating factors 
to support sparing the defendants life while prosecutors present 
aggravating factors that would warrant a death sentence 
the court ruled that in the sentencing phase of the case 
involving mrs penistons death the judge improperly told the jury 
it must agree unanimously if it is to consider a mitigating factor 
bey is one of 29 people on death row in trenton state prison he 
was the youngest inmate on death row until the conviction of philip 
dixon 21 last year of sexually assaulting stabbing with a 
railroad spike and then drowning a 13yearold girl

a federal judge found the city of yonkers in 
contempt of court today because the city council failed to pass a 
housing desegregation resolution 
calling yonkers a national symbol of defiance to civil 
rights us district judge leonard sand imposed a fine of 100 a 
day doubling daily to begin today the fine would surpass the 
citys 337 million operating budget by the 23rd day 
the yonkers city council voted monday night against endorsing a 
courtordered desegregation plan for 800 units of affordable 
housing to be built by private developers throughout the city north 
of new york city 
three of four council members who voted against the resolution 
also were found in contempt today and fined 500 per day beginning 
today the fourth vice mayor henry spallone was given at least a 
oneday adjournment to hire a lawyer 
the city of yonkers is in contempt because it chooses to be in 
contempt sand said after a onehour hearing in federal court in 
manhattan it does not find itself inadvertently in that 
position 
an attorney representing the city michael sculnick had argued 
against the contempt ruling saying fines of that magnitude are 
devastating and will bankrupt the city in three weeks 
earlier yonkers mayor nicholas wasiscko had said he hoped the 
judge would see good faith in the closeness of the 43 vote and 
delay the fines 
wasiscko who voted for the desegregation plan said he would 
call for another council meeting this week to reconsider the issue 
sand insisted the fines were remedial not punitive because 
they would end if the council changed its vote sand has said that 
if the defiant council members remained in contempt until aug 10 
they would face prison 
mondays vote came after a raucous hourlong meeting highlighted 
by shouts and jeers from the 150 people in the chambers and about 
300 outside one person was arrested for disorderly conduct and one 
person was ejected from the meeting 
in 1980 the us justice department charged that yonkers a 
city of 195000 people had intentionally segregated its housing 
and schools for 40 years 
the east side of the states fourthlargest city is 
predominately white middle to upper class it borders the wealthy 
towns of scarsdale and bronxville the west side is older more 
industrial and mostly black and hispanic it adjoins new york 
citys poorest borough the bronx 
in 1985 sand found yonkers liable it was the first time school 
and housing segregation were linked 
the citys board of education began an integration plan in 1986 
that year sand ordered the city to build 200 units of lowincome 
housing on the east side and 800 others throughout the city 160 
lowincome homes the rest for moderate incomes 
sand ordered the council to pass a resolution by monday 
supporting the plan it could not pass the actual plan because it 
must first hold a statemandated public hearing before voting on a 
zoning matter 
the council has wavered in the face of public opinion 
spallone the judges most vociferous critic demanded an 
investigation into the citys lowincome housing and into sands 
law practice spallone charged that sand was violating state law by 
forcing the vote before the public hearing 
the judge feels above the law he told a cheering crowd 
this judge can no longer address this case 
council member peter chema said it was not solely a black and 
white issue but a green issue that involves real estate 
development 
chema said sand who lives in the exclusive westchester enclave 
of pound ridge was being autocratic not democratic 
council member nicholas longo called sands actions a typical 
case of the hypocrisy of the rich and elitist looking down upon 
those who must work for everything they have 
while six of the seven council members including wasiscko 
campaigned last november on opposing sand the council agreed to a 
consent decree in january after sand threatened to fine the city 
into bankruptcy 
but residents vehemently against the decree began showing up in 
force at council meetings sent bullets in the mail to the 
councilmembers and picketed sands manhattan and pound ridge homes 
causing some of the councilmembers to backtrack 
even the us supreme courts refusal to hear the citys appeal 
hasnt daunted opponents of the housing 
sand proposed creating an independent commission to build the 
housing to circumvent city politicians 
but the justice department argued that a commission would be 
effectively letting the city off the hook once again and would 
allow the city to flout with impunity the court order

south africa has offered to 
begin withdrawing its troops from southwest africa on nov 1 
foreign minister pik botha said today 
botha said south africa made the offer today in geneva during a 
new round of peace talks on southern africa the talks involve 
south africa angola cuba and us mediators 
botha also said the south african proposal calls for elections 
in southwest africa also known as namibia on june 1 next year 
it follows that the total withdrawal of cuban troops from 
angola will be completed by june 1 1989 botha said 
an estimated 50000 cuban troops now are in angola supporting 
the countrys marxist government 
botha said the south africans want a ceasefire in the 
13yearold angolan war to go into effect aug 10 
botha said this would give united nations almost three months to 
prepare for the implementation of un resolution 435 which calls 
for south africa to grant independence to namibia 
south africa and the united states support the rebels of the 
national union for the total independence of angola unita in 
their fight against the angolan government an estimated 3000 
south african troops are in southern angola fighting alongside 
unita 
botha gave no indication how the cubans and angolans have 
responded to the south african offer 
however the offer is the first time south africa has offered a 
specific date for the implementation of resolution 435 
south africa backed by the united states has insisted that 
independence for namibia must be linked with a cuban troop 
withdrawal from angola 
cuba and angola have said that such a withdrawal could take up 
to four years while the south africans and the united states are 
seeking a much shorter timetable 
south africas mandate over southwest africa was terminated by 
the united nations in 1966 but in defiance of several un 
security council resolutions it has retained control of the 
country which possesses considerable mineral wealth

usmediated talks on peace in southern africa 
opened here today and south africas foreign minister said his 
country offered to withdraw troops from southwest africa starting 
nov 1 
foreign minister pik botha said in johannesburg that the 
proposal also called for elections in southwest africa also known 
as namibia on june 1 next year 
it follows that the total withdrawal of cuban troops from 
angola will be completed by june 1 1989 botha said 
the talks the fifth round of closeddoor negotiations that 
started in may in london are being held in genevas bunkerlike 
international conference center the us team and the joint 
angolancuban delegation arrived ahead of the south africans 
a us spokesman art skop said us officials would maintain a 
news embargo until a news conference planned by chester crocker 
the us assistant secretary of state for african affairs after 
completion of the talks here 
hopes have been buoyed by an agreement announced in new york 
july 20 on a set of 14 principles designed to establish the basis 
of peace in the region 
crocker who takes part in the talks as a mediator has 
described the july 20 accord as an important step but has 
warned that a great many hard and difficult compromises have yet 
to be achieved 
the accord was the first joint document accepted by the three 
parties locked in an undeclared war since 1975 the principles 
include an end to south african administration of southwest africa 
and the withdrawal of all cuban troops from angola 
south african angolan and cuban military commanders who met in 
a fourth round of talks late last month on cape verde off the west 
african coast were reported to have made significant progress 
toward the disengagement and withdrawal provisions 
the geneva talks were expected to focus on timetables for 
military disengagement in southern angola and for the eventual 
withdrawal of all cuban troops from angola and of south african 
troops from namibia they are also to agree on provisions ensuring 
unmonitored compliance with the withdrawal schedules 
comments from other parties directly involved in the talks 
ranged from cautious optimism voiced by south african officials to 
cuban president fidel castros statement last week that the talks 
are on the threshold of a political solution 
soviet deputy foreign minister anatoly adamyshin who on monday 
completed two days of preliminary consultations with crocker later 
told reporters chances are good of a settlement in the nearest 
future 
moscow is not directly involved but has been regularly consulted 
by the united states both superpowers have spoken of a growing 
convergence of views on the regional issues 
south africas mandate over southwest africa was terminated by 
the united nations in 1966 but in defiance of several un 
security council resolutions it has retained control of the 
country which possesses considerable mineral wealth 
cuban troops estimated by us officials to total up to 50000 
have helped the marxist angolan government to fight unita the 
rebel movement of jonos which receives military aid from south 
africa and the united states 
angola has also been used as a base by swapo the south west 
africa peoples organization that has been waging an armed struggle 
for namibian independence since 1966 
swapo and unita are not parties to the agreement but spokesmen 
for both have welcomed it

george bush nearing the republican presidential nomination 
flew to chicago today for a foreign policy speech after receiving a 
campaign present from president reagan 
while bush headed west for what aides said would be a major 
address reagan said he had decided to let a bill he opposes to 
require companies to give workers 60 days notice before closing 
plants become law without his signature 
that could relieve some of the campaign pressure on bush from 
democrats who have been using the issue to suggest the 
administration lacks compassion for workers 
craig fuller bushs chief of staff who accompanied him to 
chicago said reagans decision will make it more difficult for 
the political game to be played over the plantclosing issue 
on the other side an aide to democratic presidential nominee 
michael dukakis who has argued strongly in favor of a notification 
provision in federal law said of the decision i think its a 
testament to the people around the nation who supported this bill 
that its finally going to be in effect 
asked if reagans decision takes an issue away from dukakis 
spokesman dayton duncan said not at all the point is that 
ronald reagan and george bush tried to stop it where is george on 
this he used to oppose it 
reagan in a statement read by spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the action was being taken to get the issue over with and have 
congress get on with the nations business 
but fitzwater also noted that the democrats had been hitting 
republicans hard on the issue and he said when asked if reagan was 
acting on political considerations certainly theyre a part of 
the equation 
monday night in detroit dukakis continued efforts to win over 
former supporters of jesse jackson telling a national civilrights 
organization that government can help transform the cycle of 
poverty into a ladder of opportunity 
earlier in the day reagan had asserted that dukakis would 
destroy that opportunity 
reagans remarks monday on behalf of a senate candidate provided 
the only republican campaign salvo bush remained at the white 
house while continuing to work on choosing a running mate 
in a speech before the national urban league in detroit dukakis 
accused the reagan administration of having cramped ideals and 
limited ambitions and spending huge amounts of money on wasteful 
projects rather than helping blacks and poor people 
we have to transform the cycle of poverty into a ladder of 
opportunity and that ladder must be sturdy and strong for all our 
citizens he said 
some people say it cant be done he said i say we 
havent tried 
reagan speaking to a fundraiser for sen william v roth 
rdel took the massachusetts governor to task for declaring in 
his nomination acceptance speech that the reagan era is ending 
does he want to end the era of lower tax rates and higher real 
income for families record numbers of jobs low inflation and 
interest rates steady growth and respect not just lipservice for 
families reagan asked 
he said that if the democratic ticket is elected all of us 
may be picking up the pieces 
dukakis running mate sen lloyd bentsen of texas was working 
on welfare legislation today on capitol hill 
jackson at home in chicago spoke by telephone monday with new 
york mayor edward i koch as part of an effort to make peace at 
least long enough to help dukakis win the election 
koch criticized jackson during the new york primary race saying 
jews would be crazy to vote for jackson who supports 
palestinian selfdetermination 
i hope to work in support of dukakis and then well continue 
the ideological battle at another time koch said 
jackson did his part locally for dukakis telling some 5000 
members of the american postal workers union bush believes 
government is a tool for private industry dukakis believes the 
government is a tool for public service 
monday night in charlotte nc jackson emphasized his own 
defeated campaign for the presidency during remarks to nearly 6000 
people at the ame zion church 
politics is not a oneround fight jackson said its not 
even an even fight sometimes referees judges and the rules are 
all stacked against you and yet you cant surrender you cant 
lose by a forfeit you cant have a glass jaw you have to hang on 
in there 
there are no more impossible dreams he said im taking 
the ceiling off dreams every day i may or may not make it to the 
white house but our children will and they must 
jackson referred directly to dukakis only once a brief mention 
that the massachusetts governor garnered more primary votes than he 
did 
in a continuation of a legal battle that flared last week the 
federal election commission asked an appeals court to side with its 
decision that the dukakisbentsen campaign should get 46 million 
in funds despite bentsens reelection campaign for the senate 
bentsens challenger for the senate seat and the republican 
national senatorial committee contend the presidential and 
senatorial campaigns give bentsen an unfair financial advantage 
dukakis had some welcome legal news waiting for him on the home 
front law enforcement sources who spoke only on condition they not 
be named said the fbi has informed massachusetts that it found no 
evidence that the dukakis administration leaked confidential 
information on prisonsiting plans to developers who then bought 
land and offered to sell it to the state 
the allegations lodged by opponents of plans to build a 500bed 
state prison in rural new braintree mass had been cited by 
dukakis critics to attack the goodgovernment pledges at the center 
of his presidential campaign

this was a soft target and this makes it an extremely cowardly 
attack archie hamilton minister of state for the armed forces 
said of mondays blast we dont keep the military apart from the 
community but we will obviously now have to review our security 
arrangements 
conservative party legislator john gorst whose parliamentary 
constituency includes the barracks said security was appalling 
with the benefit of hindsight i think it would be crystal 
clear that it would be possible to move into this place with 
impunity and to move around without being challenged he said 
mondays 7 am blast the fifth ira attack since may against 
british military targets outside northern ireland knocked down 
most of a twostory brick dormitory and started a fire 
the irish republican army claimed responsibility in a message to 
the bureau of the british domestic news agency press association in 
belfast northern ireland 
the 15 men living in the dormitory were in bed when the 
explosion tore out the first floor an army spokesman said the 
building can accommodate up to 70 people 
the mainly roman catholic ira is fighting to end british rule in 
northern ireland and unite the protestantdominated province with 
the republic of ireland 
prime minister margaret thatcher who is on a trip to australia 
today condemned the attack describing it as a negation of 
democracy 
it is again another lesson why no one but no one should 
support the ira or any form of terrorism she said they dont 
like the results at the ballot box so they turn to bombing 
maiming and killing 
early today a suspected land mine blew up near an army vehicle 
in northern ireland slightly injuring six parttime soldiers 
police said the ira claimed responsibility for the 930 am 
explosion in the village of carland about 35 miles west of belfast 
the ira said it also was behind a bombing today in lisburn 11 
miles from belfast in which a policeman was killed and 18 
passersby were wounded the ira also said its members shot and 
killed a parttime soldier today after pulling him out of a store 
in west belfast 
the blast in london raised new fears for british armed forces 
personnel at home and abroad because inglis is only one of 
hundreds of small lightly guarded british bases 
reporters who went to the barracks after the blast found the 
5foothigh wire mesh perimeter fence riddled with holes one 
section had a 50foot gap 
mondays explosion was the first fatal attack by the ira in 
mainland britain since guerrillas blew up mrs thatchers hotel 
during a political convention in brighton in october 1984 she 
narrowly escaped injury but five other people were killed in the 
assassination attempt 
on march 6 in gibraltar british commandos killed three unarmed 
ira guerrillas who were said to have been on a bombing mission 
in apparent retaliation the ira resumed attacks on british 
military targets in continental europe after a 14month lull 
in the past three months three british servicemen have been 
killed and 12 other people injured in four machinegun and bombing 
attacks in west germany and holland 
the soldier killed monday was identified as 23yearold michael 
robbins a lance corporal in the royal engineers

the united states is consulting with several 
of its allies about the possibility of establishing an 
international peacekeeping force in cambodia once vietnam pulls 
out its troops the state department said today 
an international force is one of several measures being 
discussed by the vietnamesebacked government of cambodia and the 
three main guerrilla factions fighting to overthrow it said deputy 
spokesman phyllis oakley 
we have been consulting with our friends she said but 
added that this is in a very preliminary stage 
the phnom penh government held a first round of talks last week 
in indonesia with the guerrillas and representatives of vietnam to 
work out a plan for the withdrawal of all vietnamese troops from 
the country 
the united states the soviet union and china have all pledged 
to support efforts to find a solution 
the state department comments followed a call by the chairman of 
a key congressional panel to set up an international force to 
prevent the khmer rouge from returning to power 
rep stephen solarz dny also urged the united states and 
other western governments to prevent the reemergence of the khmer 
rouge which he said could very easily lead to another holocaust 
in cambodia 
i think the west needs to do much more than what it has been 
doing in order to prevent such a dreadful eventuality from coming 
about solarz chairman of the house foreign affairs subcommittee 
on asian and pacific affairs said on the cbstv this morning 
program 
the khmer rouge are accused of killing hundreds of thousands of 
people from 1975 to 1978 while trying to turn cambodia into a 
primitive agrarian society 
vietnam ended the khmer rouge reign when it invaded cambodia in 
1978 and vietnamese troops have occuped the nation since then 
vietnam has pledged to withdraw its remaining 120000 troops by 
1990 but is demanding assurances that the khmer rouge led by pol 
pot will not return to power but the khmer forces remain the 
strongest of the three resistance groups fighting the hanoibacked 
government in phnom phen 
talks between vietnam the resistance forces and other southeast 
asian nations were held last week in indonesia but little progress 
was reported 
solarz called on the united states and other nations to pressure 
china to end its military assistance to the khmer rouge and urge 
thailand to deny the khmer guerillas the use of thai territory as a 
base 
but he indicated more than diplomatic pressure is needed against 
a khmer army solarz called a ruthless gang of murderers 
we need to prevail upon the vietnamese to accept the 
establishment of an international peacekeeping force which could 
be sent into cambodia as the vietnamese withdraw in order to 
provide some insurance against the return of the khmer rouge to 
power solarz said 
dith pran a cambodian who escaped captivity under the khmer 
rouge and now works as a photographer for the new york times 
appeared in the same interview as solarz and urged western 
governments to isolate the khmer rouge 
im afraid another holocaust could happen said pran 
whose escape was dramatized in the film the killing fields

the united states sharply criticized iraq 
today for its use of chemical weapons against iran after a un 
team found the iraqis were using deadly gases in large quantities 
we condemn iraqs use of chemical weapons said deputy state 
department spokesman phyllis oakley there can be no 
justification whatsoever for this practice and we condemn its use 
anywhere 
the united states has in the past made its views on the subject 
known to iraq she added mrs oakley declined to say whether a 
similar message had been conveyed to iraq since the un report was 
released monday 
a team that visited iran and iraq last month found that iraq is 
continuing to use mustard and nerve gas on an intensive scale 
despite frequent pleas that it stop 
the un inquiry was requested by iran which charged that iraq 
had killed thousands of people in the spring with chemicals at 
iraqs request the team later went to baghdad but its report about 
irans use of chemical weapons was much less detailed 
the secretarygeneral is conducting talks with both sides on 
ending their eightyear war and implementing a ceasefire

it could rehire mrs arline and pay her 125470 in back pay or

two teenage boys who allegedly confessed 
to killing a bus driver in a vengeful shooting had planned to 
hijack the vehicle and execute the passengers police said 
the boys arrested sunday night were booked for investigation 
of murder and remained in custody at a juvenile detention center 
they faced arraignment later today in the slaying of ac transit 
driver billy bj givens 
givens 43 died thursday shortly after being shot at 
pointblank range with a 22caliber rifle three passengers 
suffered gunshot wounds 
the suspects 15 and 17 told police they wanted to avenge a 
traffic accident that killed their friends mother ellen palmer 
police lt jim hahn said 
they had several meetings to plan their attack they were 
going to board the bus force the driver to a remote area and 
execute him and any passengers that might be witnesses hahn 
said if the first bus was too crowded they would wait for 
another 
but the two scrapped the plan at the last minute for an unknown 
reason hahn said when they boarded a bus with 20 people on it 
after the 17yearold shouted obscenities at givens the driver 
asked whats wrong and was shot several times police said 
the day before mrs palmer 52 was killed in a collision with 
an ac transit bus givens was not the driver and the fatal 
accident did not occur on his line hahn said 
in their interviews with investigators the juveniles gave the 
sole motive for the murder as a retaliation against ac transit for 
what they perceived as the wrongful death of their friends 
mother hahn said 
the older youth escaped six or seven months ago from a detention 
center in san leandro where he had been sent in connection with 
drug charges hahn said a warrant had been filed for the younger 
boy who failed to appear in juvenile court recently on a burglary 
charge police said 
witnesses said four young men had stepped aboard givens 
vehicle but hahn said monday that only two youths actually got on 
the bus a third youth was a friend who followed the suspects in a 
vain attempt to dissuade them from carrying out their plan and the 
fourth probably was a passerby he said

scientists using a 
oneperson submersible craft plan wednesday to make the first of 20 
dives looking for hot springs at the bottom of crater lake the 
deepest lake in the united states 
at a news conference on the lake rim national park service 
officials and researchers said they hope to confirm the existence 
of thermal vents on the lake bottom and gather data on many other 
features of the unusual body of water 
scientists began assembling gear for the unprecedented dive 
monday the submersible craft called deep rover and designed 
for ocean exploration was scheduled to be placed in the lake today 
the lake which resulted from the explosion of mount mazama 
nearly 7000 years ago is 1932 feet deep and is famous for its 
clear cobaltblue water 
the waters clarity is the main reason for the exploration of 
the lake which comes about halfway through a 10year study 
launched by congress in 1983 
scientists in the 1970s noticed that a small device used to 
measure the clarity of crater lake barely could be seen at 85 feet 
below the lakes surface before then the device frequently could 
be seen as deep as 115 feet 
scientists theorize vents below the lakes floor may be altering 
the clarity by stirring up sediment and plant life in the lake 
which has no inlets or outlets 
oregon state university researchers jack dymond and robert 
collier will take turns manning the submersible vessel on the 
dives they discovered small vents on the lake bottom last summer 
using a remote control diving device and say there is sufficient 
evidence to indicate the vents are hydrothermal that is the 
water coming from them is heated somehow 
dymond said it would require a remarkable coincidence of 
events to justify any other hypotheses because of the chemical 
differences found near the vents 
although the focus of the project is a search for geothermal 
activity the scientists are looking at it as a general study of 
the famous lake dymond said 
the lake has an incredible and complex volcanic glacial and 
explosive history he said 
officials said the major advantages of the deep rover which 
resembles a clear plastic bubble are its mobility and the 
exceptional visibility the operator has virtually 360 degrees 
extending arms on the device can be used to collect water samples 
and to probe into the vents 
dymond said it will allow the scientists to see crater walls 
below the surface that for the most part have never been observed 
before 
the exploration will be based on wizard island in the lake as a 
result the regular tour boat runs to the island have been 
suspended until the end of the project aug 28

an oscar awarded to 20th century fox for the 
development of cinemascope has been ordered off the auction block 
and back to the studio for safekeeping until its ownership is 
decided 
the statuette for technical achievement which is smaller than 
the figurines handed to producers actors and directors was 
scheduled to be auctioned tuesday with two other oscars at the 
collectors bookstore in hollywood 
but superior court judge miriam vogel agreed with an attorney 
representing the studio monday that there were enough unresolved 
questions about the oscars custody to prevent it from being sold 
she set an aug 24 hearing on the matter 
this is a real travesty of justice said collectors 
bookstore owner malcolm willits after the ruling those 
indiangivers fox after 34 years of not even missing it is now 
demanding it back 
willits said the oscar presented in 1954 has been in the 
possession of esther roberts who was personal secretary for 15 
years to late fox president darryl zanuck 
he declined to say why roberts wanted to sell the statuette 
willits said roberts discovered the oscar in a back room at fox 
the year zanuck accepted it when she asked her boss about it 
willits said zanuck told her it had no sentimental value to him and 
she could have it 
but fox attorney louis meisinger claimed in his lawsuit to stop 
the auction of the statuette that zanuck was acting in the 
absence of any corporate resolution or other authorization when 
he gave his secretary the oscar 
willits countered that the powerful zanuck reigned supreme 
at the studio and in the entertainment industry and controlled at 
that time a majority of fox stock he said it was obvious that 
zanuck needed to consult no one about giving away the statuette 
vogel ordered collectors bookstore not to sell conceal or 
diminish the value of the statuette and extended the order to 
roberts 
meisinger said the studios legal claim on the oscar evolved 
through an agreement it signed with the motion picture academy of 
arts and sciences upon receipt in 1954 to offer the statuette back 
to the academy before selling it 
the academy since relinquished those rights to the studio and 
fox argues that roberts must offer the oscar to it for a 10 
consideration before she can sell it 
meisinger estimated the statuettes value at 3000 and the 
studio on monday posted a 6000 bond for its possession 
willits said he thought it would bring 10000 at auction 
because it was awarded to a major studio for an important 
contribution

during filming while special projector lenses correctly 
reinterpret the film on a special wide screen

summer school students who went to the 
bathroom outside of an approved break were charged 225 per visit 
to pay teachers who had to stay late with them to make up the lost 
time 
the policy at socastee high school which has been in effect for 
many years was denounced by some students as unfair but horry 
county school superintendent john dawsey said it was not a hardship 
for students and was necessary financially 
the bathroom fee stems from a state rule that students are 
required to attend 124 hours of summer school classes to make up 
work they did not pass during the school year 
when summer school students are late for class leave early or 
use the bathroom they must make up the time lost after school and 
teachers must stay late with them 
students were charged a 100 fee for the sixweek summer 
session for time missed from class students were charged 225 
per 15 minutes derived from a breakdown of teacher salaries at 9 
an hour 
they were given one free break each day during a halfhour 
in the middle of the four hours 
for 10th grader angel sparks bathroom fees amounted to 2025 
for the sixweek session 
i think its stupid she said you cant help it if you 
have to go to the restroom when you have to go you have to go 
you shouldnt be charged for something like that its dumb 
i thought it was unfair and unreasonable said keith jones 
another 10th grader 
but dawsey said students should be able to limit their bathroom 
trips to the break 
unless youve got diarrhea or food poisoning your system is 
such that you can go two hours without using the bathroom he 
said 
still for next year dawsey said he will change the schedule a 
bit instead of a 30minute break after two hours he said students 
will be given 10minute breaks after each of three hours

american and filipino negotiators 
tuesday resumed talks on the status of us military bases but gave 
no indication of progress on the issue of compensation for the use 
of the bases 
after a meeting lasting more than two hours the two panels 
issued a statement saying they would meet again wednesday they 
refused to answer questions 
tuesdays session was the first since talks broke off a week ago 
according to the statement the negotiators discussed 
compensation the main problem as well as security around the 
sites and the issue of criminal jurisdiction over us troops 
filipino officials said last week that us inflexibility over 
compensation was responsible for the interruption in the talks 
the united states pays the philippines 180 million in military 
and economic aid each year in exchange for the use of clark air 
base subic bay naval base and four smaller facilities 
sources close to the talks said the filipinos demand a raise of 
at least 12 billion but the americans have refused the sources 
who spoke on condition of anonymity said the americans were 
willing to increase compensation only by 360 million 
the americans have proposed that the philippine side also 
consider as compensation the 500 million the bases spend annually 
in salaries to filipino employees and on local purchases the 
sources said 
after announcing the resumption of the talks tuesday foreign 
secretary raul manglapus said our position has already been 
subjected to change and we are not about to change it again 
a source who asked not to be identified said that during 
tuesdays session us ambassador nicholas platt and manglapus 
secluded themselves from the rest of the negotiatiors to discuss 
the question of compensation 
the sources said the americans were reluctant to agree to a 
drastic increase in compensation because of uncertainty over the 
status of the bases after their lease expires in 1991 
the lease may be extended by a formal treaty ratified by 
twothirds of the 23member senate where opposition to the bases 
is strong

the university of minnesota hospital is 
investigating its chief heartlung surgeon for allegedly ordering 
an associate to perform a bypass operation on a patient considered 
dead before surgery began a newspaper reported tuesday 
hospital officials also are looking into an allegation that 
stuart jamieson or one of his assistants left a pair of surgical 
forceps in another heart patients chest then failed to inform the 
patient the patients family or operating room personnel when the 
instrument was removed during a second operation the minneapolis 
star tribune said in a copyright story 
jamieson chief of cardiothoracic surgery at the university of 
minnesota hospital and director of its heartlung institute 
declined to comment but spokeswoman sue swenson said jamieson has 
denied all the accusations in interviews with hospital officials 
what you have are rumors that are the product of professional 
jealousy ms swenson said dr jamieson has decided not to 
dignify them with a response 
jamieson a former director of stanford university medical 
centers heartlung transplant program was hired by the university 
in march 1986 to develop a similar program the first in the 
midwest 
the newspaper quoted sources who said that jamieson overruled a 
heart surgeon in his department on may 5 and ordered her to perform 
a coronary artery bypass on a 43yearold woman minutes earlier 
the surgeon had canceled the operation because she believed the 
patient was dead 
however about 10 minutes after the operation was canceled the 
surgeon notified operating room nurses the bypass would be 
performed after all on orders from jamieson after the operation 
the patient remained attached to a mechanical heart pump but never 
regained consciousness the newspaper said 
a hospital pathologist who performed an autopsy concluded the 
surgery had been unnecessary since the woman either was clinically 
dead at the time or had no chance of surviving the bypass operation 
the womans medical insurance carrier was billed more than 
22000 for that operation and for a second exploratory operation 
hours later in which doctors attempted to stop internal bleeding 
jamieson also is under investigation for allegedly failing to 
disclose that a pair of forceps had been left in the chest cavity 
of a 78yearold man who underwent a coronary artery bypass april 
15 the newspaper said 
the forceps were discovered in a routine chest xray but the 
three xrays showing the location of the forceps have been missing 
from the patients medical records since shortly after the second 
operation was performed the newspaper said 
the patients insurance company was billed about 19000 for the 
two operations the newspaper said 
jamieson has told hospital officials that no forceps were found 
in the patients chest

a 14hour uprising at a maximumsecurity 
prison ended peacefully early today when inmates who had 
complained of being harassed by officers released the last four of 
their five hostage guards 
two guards at the states coxsackie correctional facility were 
hospitalized and listed in good condition this morning three 
others were treated and released for minor injuries one inmate 
received minor injuries 
a guard who went into the prison after the uprising said the 
inmates had destroyed their unit designated for inmates with 
disciplinary problems 
it was 15 hours of terror for the guards state corrections 
commissioner thomas coughlin said 
at a news conference in albany today gov mario cuomo and 
coughlin described the uprising as an unorganized chain of events 
that escalated quicker than the inmates had intended 
what were dealing with is a mob coughlin said it was a 
bunch of young kids acting as a committee of 32 there was no 
planning there was no organization they knocked an officer down 
they took two other officers nightsticks and they said oh my 
god look what weve done now 
cuomo said earlier a potentially explosive confrontation has 
been defused without loss of life or the surrender to any 
demands 
inmates seized the guards about 1030 am monday during a 
recreation period said james flateau a spokesman for the state 
corrections department the unit housed 32 inmates but it was not 
known how many participated in the uprising said flateau 
inmates throughout the prison remained confined to their cells 
this morning he said 
coughlin said he wasnt sure what provoked the takeover which 
began when an unidentified inmate attacked guard lewis bloom in a 
recreation yard and took his nightstick then seven other inmates 
overpowered two more guards took their nightsticks and and command 
of the unit 
coughlin said none of the inmates had additional weapons 
although he said one may have taken a guards pocket knife 
cuomo and coughlin said no demands were made during 
negotiations which were mostly between two inmates and prison 
superintendent john twomey who was assisted by a department crisis 
intervention unit 
cuomo said the inmates had only requested that they not be 
beaten up when they released their hostages 
i think they got tired coughlin said i think they felt 
very strongly that they were in over their heads after the initial 
assault and for a number of hours last night i think they were 
trying to figure a way out we just sat back and waited and kept 
talking to them and kept giving them their options 
earlier flateau had said some of the inmates had complained 
about verbal harassment by guards verbal harassment was the 
complaint they mentioned most often food complaints things like 
that flateau said but he later said harassment was not the 
major point being negotiated 
outside the prison which houses 951 inmates guard ralph scott 
said inmates had been warning for weeks that there might be 
trouble in the last two weeks he said prisoners verbal and 
physical assaults on corrections officers had increased 
but coughlin said this morning that the prison showed none of 
the usual signs of an imminent uprising 
the indicators that i judge were not there coughlin said 
sure people were saying it was getting tense prisons are tense 
in hot weather 
cuomo had said earlier he did not think the generally crowded 
condition of new york prisons contributed to the problem because 
capacity is not a problem at coxsackie 
guard david pratt 31 of coxsackie was upgraded today from 
serious to good condition with abdominal injuries said albany 
medical center spokeswoman mary macintosh 
the three others released this morning bloom 41 of freehold 
douglas roberts 37 of troy and john shipley 32 of scotia 
were treated and released she said 
a guard released monday night warren agostinoni 28 of cairo 
was in good condition with cuts and bruises said another 
spokeswoman peggy pitcher 
inmate anthony milo 19 was treated for chest and back injuries 
and released pitcher said 
a guard who said he helped carry bloom out to an ambulance said 
this morning his colleague was badly battered i believe all of 
them were 
joe kraft president of local 1264 of the prison guards union 
also said broken glass was strewn about the prison unit there was 
an inch of water on the ground and cabinets were moved he said 
there was probably nothing that could be destroyed that they 
didnt destroy kraft said coughlin said today that the unit 
will require repairs but he wouldnt elaborate

the united states is holding 
billions of dollars worth of impounded iranian military equipment 
and iran has raised the issue in connection with american hostages 
in lebanon 
statements last week by irans acting commanderinchief 
hashemi rafsanjani marked the third time since the 1979 seizure of 
the 52 american hostages at the us embassy in tehran that the 
issue of iranian assets frozen by the united states has been linked 
to american hostages 
if he is talking about military equipment then the 
arbitration of irans claim against the united states for the value 
of spare parts and other equipment ordered before the revolution is 
continuing said an american official at the iranus claims 
tribunal 
the tribunal is adjudicating billions of dollars worth of claims 
arising out of the 1979 iranian revolution the american official 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
iran has filed a 12 billion claim against the united states for 
the miltary equipment and spare parts the largest claim before the 
tribunal iran seeks delivery of the equipment or payment of its 
value 
the military materiel was ordered by shah mohammad reza 
pahlavis government through the us governments foreign military 
sales program 
transfer of the equipment to iran as well as billions of 
dollars of iranian funds on deposit in american banks was frozen 
by the us government after the seizure of the embassy hostages 
the algiers accords that resulted in freedom for the hostages in 
january 1981 also unblocked the iranian assets 
but despite the algiers accords the military equipment much of 
which was already paid for was then impounded by the us 
government to prevent its use in the iraniraq war 
we do have a bunch of their irans stuff and theres no 
question that its their stuff said a tribunal official who 
also spoke on condition he not be identified 
in august 1980 almost 10 months after the hostage seizure iran 
said at the united nations that the united states release of the 
frozen iranian funds would be a symbolic gesture that might 
speed the iranian parliaments debate on the fate of the 52 
american hostages 
in addition to freedom for the hostages the 1981 algiers 
accords effectively worked out guidelines for the arbitration of 
financial claims against iran and the return of money left over 
the american official at the tribunal said that the 9 billion 
in financial assets frozen by the united states already has been 
returned to iran or dispersed to its creditors via the algiers 
accords which established the tribunal 
the bulk of the money went to repay bank loans to iran but 
2915 billion left after repayment was returned to iran during the 
course of 1981 
in late 1986 rafsanjani reportedly linked the return of 
usheld iranian assets to possible iranian intercession for 
americans taken hostage in lebanon 
the issue came up against the backdrop of negotiations for the 
release of 4514 million in a new york federal reserve bank 
account 
that money was the residue of 3667 billion deposited at the 
bank to repay syndicated bank loans owed by iran 
the reported hostageassets link was later denied by iran and 
the 4514 million was paid to iran in may 1987 
much of the impounded military materiel which reportedly 
includes spare parts for irans outgunned air force is stored in 
various private warehouses rented by iran 
on july 27 irans official islamic republic news agency quoted 
rafsanjani who is also speaker of the iranian parliment as saying 
that if president reagan were sincere he would release the 
iranian assets i have said that once he does so then we will use 
our leverage in lebanon and help solve the issue of the hostages 
the agency said rafsanjani cited the example of the united 
states freezing of and its refusal to deliver the items purchased 
and paid for during the shahs rule in iran 
on monday white house spokesman marlin fitzwater disclosed that 
the iranian government had communicated directly to the us 
government its insistence that the united states release iranian 
assets 
us officials reiterated that they would not enter into any 
discussions with iranian officials to negotiate the release of the 
nine americans held hostage in lebanon by people sympathetic to the 
revolutionary government of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini

parliament on tuesday voted unanimously to 
amend the constitution to give the president greater control over 
the judiciary and to broaden police arrest power 
the changes were pushed through parliament just five days after 
attorney general matthew muli proposed them in the official kenya 
gazette 
clergymen and the law society of kenya opposed the changes 
warning that they would weaken constitutional checks and balances 
and erode individual liberties 
the changes empower the president to fire a high court or court 
of appeals judge without having to go through the current tribunal 
process and without giving a reason 
parliament also voted to expand from 24 hours to 14 days the 
period in which police can hold a person suspected of a capital 
offense before bringing him to court 
there normally is a 14day period between the time a bill is 
proposed and parliament debates it but legislators voted tuesday 
to reduce the waiting period for debate on the constitutional 
changes to the elapsed five days 
joshua angatia was the only member of the 201 onechamber 
legislature to vote against the procedural change that allowed for 
the quick debate and vote 
the bill was read three times as required by law votes were 
taken only on the second and third reading 
the vote on the second reading was 1510 in favor of the 
constitutional changes by the time the third vote was set more 
members had entered the chamber and the bill passed 1600 
kenya by law is a one party state and the approval of the 
constitutional changes had been expected 
tuesdays bill was the 10th amendment to the constitution since 
1969 
in december 1986 parliament amended the constitution to remove 
tenure for the offices of attorney general and auditorgeneral 
lawyers and clergymen fought against those changes saying they 
reduced the independence of the attorney general and the 
auditorgeneral 
the constitution was written in 1969 to update a bulky 1963 
independence constitution which had become cumbersome because of 
numerous amendments

a lutheran minister and a journalist 
accused of smuggling two pregnant salvadorans into the united 
states were acquitted today by a federal jury 
the us district court jury which was given the case monday 
afternoon returned innocent verdicts on all counts after 4 hours 
of deliberations 
the rev glen remerthamert 44 had been charged with one count 
of conspiracy and two counts each of transporting harboring and 
inducing ines camposanzora and cecelia eliasalegria to enter the 
united states 
demetria martinez 28 had been charged with one count of 
conspiracy to violate immigration laws and two counts each of 
transporting and inducing the women to enter the united states 
their trial began july 13 
outside court remerthamert called the verdict a victory for 
the sanctuary movement a grassroots effort that has been going on 
since 1980 to aid refugees from central america 
ms martinez said she hoped the victory will encourage other 
reporters to get out and find out what the government has to hide 
in its role in the situation in el salvador 
us attorney william lutz said he believed there was good 
evidence the salvadoran women entered the country illegally and 
were transported illegally 
but the question was one of intent and the jury disagreed with 
our position on what the intent was he said 
us district judge john conway on monday denied a defense 
motion for a mistrial made on the basis of evidence introduced 
early in the trial regarding two mail fraud charges against 
remerthamert conway has thrown out those charges ruling the 
prosecution had not presented sufficient evidence 
alice hector attorney for remerthamert portrayed her client 
as a religious man who believed he could legally help two refugees 
under thengov toney anayas proclamation declaring new mexico a 
sanctuary state 
ms martinezs attorney tova indritz contended her client went 
as a journalist on the august 1986 trip to bring the women to 
albuquerque and was protected by the first amendment guarantee of 
freedom of the press 
but lutz said the case concerned the smuggling of illegal aliens 
to put their babies up for adoption and then send the mothers back 
to el salvador 
its about two people who thought they were above the law 
said lutz 
he called the situation of the two salvadoran women an american 
tragedy cecelia and ines are victims lutz said 
lutz also said the defendants knew anayas proclamation was not 
valid citing the fact that they took a back road to avoid the us 
border patrol in bringing the women from el paso texas to 
albuquerque 
but ms hector said it made sense for remerthamert to believe 
he was acting legally because of the declaration 
she said that in 1986 there were conflicting statements about 
the meaning of the sanctuary declaration which does not contain 
the words symbolic proclamation 
ms hector also cited statements the us immigration and 
naturalization service made at the time that people would be 
deluded into relying on the proclamation 
if they thought no one would believe it why did they warn 
people about it she said 
ms indritz said ms martinez who writes for the albuquerque 
journal and national catholic reporter made no arrangements for 
the women and did not help them 
ms martinez testified she never wrote about the women because 
she feared it could jeopardize their safety or their families in el 
salvador 
the mere fact someone does not write an article does not mean 
she was not engaged in news gathering ms indritz said 
the attorney also attacked the credibility of the two 
salvadorans who testified as prosecution witnesses she said their 
testimony contradicted other evidence and testimony and at times 
they contradicted themselves

three railroad employees forced to undergo 
drug testing after they found a corpse on a stretch of track have 
accused police of violating their constitutional rights 
the railway labor executives association representing the men 
in a federal lawsuit claims police acted unconstitutionally 
because there was no probable cause and because they ignored 
provisions on worker testing outlined in the federal railroad 
safety act 
according to the complaint filed july 13 the three soo line 
employees were working on a switch engine early may 29 in a 
minneapolis train yard when they discovered the corpse on the 
tracks near the nicollet bridge 
the plaintiffs alleged there was no evidence the dead man had 
been involved in a train crash or had been struck by a train yet 
police took the three in for drug and alcohol testing 
the men were made to undergo urine tests which came back 
negative without probable cause or suspicion they were impaired by 
alcohol or drugs or were in any way involved in the mans death 
according to the suit which names police chief anthony bouza 
police also violated the federal railroad safety act which 
delegates to the us secretary of transportation the authority to 
set appropriate regulations and standards for all areas of railroad 
safety chemical testing included the suit alleged 
police are preempted from testing railroad workers except as 
permitted by the federal act and this incident was not an 
exception it contended 
the lawsuit asks the court to find that the testing of the three 
men was unconstitutional and that testing in such situations is 
governed by federal regulations 
steve fredrickson assistant minneapolis city attorney who will 
handle the case said he couldnt comment on the suit until he had 
conferred with bouza about the departments position bouza said he 
wouldnt not comment until he had read the complaint

the nations fire deaths shrank just a fraction 
last year to 5810 the sixth year that preventive strategies 
failed to make a significant dent in the death toll the national 
fire protection association said tuesday 
the number of civilians who died in 1987 decreased less than 1 
percent from 1986s total of 5850 deaths according to the report 
compiled by the quincybased association firefighter deaths were 
not included in the totals 
reasons for the sixyear plateau in the death toll include 
waning interest in home safety a slowing in development of fire 
retardant home products which made significant advances in the 
last decade and growth in the highrisk populations of the elderly 
and the very young said dr john r hall jr the associations 
director of fire analysis and research 
were somewhat grasping at explanations too hall said 
fire is so complicated that you cant say for sure you know 
whats driving it weve reached a point where those national 
strategies like smoke detectors that were big enough and effective 
enough have leveled off 
home fires killed 4570 people last year down 18 percent from 
4655 in 1986 but they still accounted for 786 percent of all 
fire deaths 
since 1984 there has been little progress in installing smoke 
detectors and about onethird of those already in place are 
inoperable many because of dead batteries hall said 
fires caused by smoking materials remain the leading cause of 
fatal home blazes hall said the most common fires are caused by 
cigarettes smoldering in couches or chairs he said 
outdoor fires were up 10 percent with 56000 more brush grass 
wildland crop and timber fires an increase partly blamed on 
drought conditions 
youve got an arson problem in outdoor fires youve got a lot 
of carelessness then if you drop the weather situation on top of 
that what might have been a small fire turns into a large fire 
the south led all regions with a fire death rate of 290 per 
million population a regional rate that was 211 percent higher 
than the national average of 239 per million the higher incidence 
of fire deaths in the south is partly due to its large population 
of rural poor hall said 
the number of civilians injured in fires totaled 28215 in 1987 
a 52 percent increase from the previous year that brought figures 
back to the levels of 198485 
the northeast region had the highest civilian fire injury rate 
with 1264 fire injuries per million population but that was 
similar to other regions the report said 
property damage increased 49 percent to 704 billion in 
keeping with inflation the report said 
breaking the impasse on fire deaths will require more widespread 
education programs renewed attention to home smoke detectors 
wider use of residential sprinklers and improvements in products 
typically involved in home fatal fires such as cigarettes and 
lighters said michael j karter jr a senior statistician with 
the association and author of the report 
national fire prevention week in october will focus on 
installing and maintaining smoke detectors hall said 
our biggest obstacle right now is trying to break through that 
misguided belief in personal invulnerability all we can do is 
point to the numbers

officials think the flies flew almost immediately to the baited 
traps after emerging from their cocoons donley said adding that 
ground spraying was carried out at the property 
the discovery wont force another round of aerial pesticide 
spraying he said 
officials removed thousands of traps in preparation for the 
sterile fly release donley said previously more than 100 traps 
per square mile were hung from trees in the residential 
neighborhoods he said 
the first release of 4 million from an airplane and roving 
trucks was to be followed by daily releases for about two months 
totaling between 20 million and 40 million flies weekly coverering 
two possible generations of medfly development donley said 
similar use of sterile male flies helped eradicate medfly 
infestation in eastern los angeles county last summer 
three medflies were discovered july 20 in fruit tree traps and 
a fourth was found just before officials sprayed a 16squaremile 
area of northridge reseda and sepulveda on july 25 
the medflies are feared because they reproduce rapidly and use 
so many different fruits and vegetables as egglaying sites 
infesting the fruit with maggots 
medflies are often brought to the mainland accidentally by 
tourists who bring fruits from hawaii and pacific rim nations 
the sterile flies may wander into homes but pose no health 
threat to humans and most people wont notice them ms curry said 
the sterile flies are raised at a state laboratory in hawaii 
the lab was established after the californias damaging 1981 medfly 
infestation which cost the state 976 million in eradication 
efforts

specialinterest groups gave 98 million in 
speaking fees to members of congress last year in hopes of 
influencing legislation the public interest lobby common cause 
said tuesday in arguing that the practice should be banned 
members of congress simply cannot fully meet their public 
responsibilities when they are indebted to private interest groups 
who are paying them large honoraria fees said common cause 
president fred wertheimer 
large amounts of money are going into the pockets of legislators 
with direct jurisdiction over matters of interest to the interest 
groups the group said 
these fees are being used to try to influence congressional 
decisions said wertheimer honoraria fees are undermining the 
integrity of congress and should be banned outright 
at the same time house speaker jim wright dtexas endorsed 
the concept of a ban on outside speaking and writing fees if it is 
linked to a pay raise for members of congress 
wright disagreed with the contention that the fees influence 
lawmakers in their policymaking but he acknowledged there is an 
appearance of a conflict of interest that warrants banning the 
practice 
ive seen the growth in honoraria by trade associations and 
the appearance of it has been made to look evil so lets get rid 
of it wright told a group of reporters at a luncheon monday 
it would be a very healthy thing for congress 
a common cause study found that senators received a total of 
31 million in honoraria in 1987 according to their financial 
disclosure reports an average of 31000 each house members got a 
combined total of 67 million averaging 15500 apiece 
the averages dont tell the full story however some members 
refuse to accept honoraria and others particularly committee 
chairmen and influential senior members are in positions to 
garner far more than the average amount 
house members are allowed by law to keep for their own use an 
amount of outside earned income up to 30 percent of their salaries 
that meant they could keep as much as 25885 in 1987 senators 
could keep up to 40 percent of their salary amount or 34993 
amounts received in excess of those limits had to be donated to 
charity 
current congressional salaries are 89500 a year but a 
presidential commission appointed to study the politically delicate 
pay issue has recommended that they be raised to 135000 
some forms of income such as book royalties are not included 
in the lid on outside earned income wrights receipt of more than 
60000 in such royalties is among six counts now under 
investigation by the house ethics committee 
the common cause study focused on the house and senate commerce 
and banking committees as particularly subject to honoraria 
payments from groups with interest in their legislative areas 
members of the house energy and commerce committee got a total 
of 905000 in fees from interest groups in 1987 nearly half of it 
from communications energy and health interests with legislative 
matters under the panels jurisdiction the study found senate 
commerce committee members received 662000 onequarter of it 
from communications and transportation interests 
the house and senate banking committees each received in excess 
of 600000 in speaking fees last year for the house panel nearly 
half came from financial interests and for the senate committee 
the proportion was 26 percent 
for rep doug barnard dga the leading honoraria recipient on 
the house banking committee 70 percent of his 36780 came from 
financial groups the study found rep chalmers wylie of ohio the 
panels senior republican received 25050 89 percent of it from 
financial interests 
among interest groups the top givers in the study were the 
american trucking associations which gave 117500 in fees to 21 
senators and 62 house members the national association of 
broadcasters which gave 114300 in honoraria the securities 
industry association 110000 the tobacco institute 102000 
and the investment firm paine webber 100688

criminal cases have gone to court against 20 
people charged in ethnic rioting in the caucasus and communist 
party leaders from azerbaijan and armenia met to discuss ways to 
ease remaining tensions tass said tuesday 
the riots erupted feb 28 in the azerbaijan city of sumgait 
leaving 32 people dead 26 of them armenians and more than 200 
people injured 
the unrest began amid an emotional armenian campaign calling for 
the mountainous region of nagornokarabakh to be annexed by armenia 
the disputed nagornokarabakh region has been part of azerbaijan 
since 1923 its population is more than threequarters armenian 
but it has no common borders with the armenian republic 
the official soviet news agency quoted the soviet prosecutors 
office as saying that 94 people had been arrested to date in the 
sumgait rioting among them murderers rapists and robbers 
in addition tass said 200 apartments in sumgait were ransacked 
about 50 cultural and service facilities damaged and 40 cars 
vandalized and some set on fire 
sixteen criminal cases involving 20 defendants in the rioting 
have been submitted to court tass said it gave no indication of 
when trial would begin or where 
on july 8 the soviet supreme court and the prosecutors office 
transferred the legal cases against the rioters out of azerbaijan 
and into courts of the russian republic 
that demand had been voiced by armenian activists who said the 
courts in azerbaijan were incapable of ruling fairly in cases where 
azerbaijanis were accused of attacking armenians 
the presidium of the supreme soviet intervened in the dispute on 
july 18 ruling that the district will remain in azerbaijan and 
calling for measures to develop the districts economy and culture 
the presidium the nations top executive body also dispatched 
an envoy to the area arkady volsky as its representative and that 
of the central committee the communist partys policymaking body 
tass said volsky met tuesday with armenian party chief soren 
arutyunan and azerbaijan party boss abdul rakhman vezirov in 
stepanakert capital of the nagornokarabakh region 
the leaders discussed how to fulfill decisions of the party and 
state leadership on bringing the situation back to normal in 
nagornokarabakh and stimulating the areas economic and social 
development tass said 
armenians have accused the azerbaijani leadership of ignoring 
the needs of the regions armenian population 
it is impermissible that the decisions adopted by the party 
and the government are so far being fulfilled in an unsatisfactory 
manner by union ministries and agencies by republican and regional 
bodies tass said 
the participants in the stepanakert meeting called for 
exhaustive measures to rectify the situation tass said 
it did not say what steps were considered only that a number 
of constructive proposals were worked out to ensure a fuller 
utilisation of the possibilities of both republics to accelerate 
the social economic and cultural development of the 
nagornokarabakh autonomous region

president ali khamenei of iran said 
tuesday his government wont agree to the direct peace negotiations 
iraq demands and an end to the 8yearold war appears extremely 
doubtful 
a spokesman for javier perez de cuellar said the un 
secretarygeneral would not declare a ceasefire unilaterally 
which had appeared previously to be his intention iraq said it 
would not accept the fait accompli of a unilateral declaration 
official news reports from tehran said millions of people filled 
streets of iranian cities to show support for ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini the 87yearold patriarch of the fundamentalist islamic 
revolution 
khamenei said iran would not accept preconditions for a truce 
based on resolution 598 which the un security council passed 
unanimously a year ago iraq said it would accept the resolution 
soon after it was passed but iran did not do so until july 18 
iraq has launched several attacks in frontier areas since iran 
offered to accept the resolution and insists on facetoface talks 
before a truce is declared 
an arab league committee trying to end the war met with high 
iraqi officials tuesday in baghdad 
perez de cuellar said monday he would announce a ceasefire 
starting date after his factfinding team returned from to un 
headquarters in new york this week from the persian gulf adding 
that it does not depend on the parties 
on tuesday however spokesman francois giuliani said perez de 
cuellar would consult the security council and possibly the two 
belligerents before proclaiming a truce 
it is not his intention to declare a ceasefire 
unilaterally giuliani said theoretically he can do so 
practically he will consult 
when he arrived at un headquarters tuesday the 
secretarygeneral told reporters when i say i will declare a 
ceasefire in consultation with members of the security council 
i do not exclude that i would be in touch with the two foreign 
ministers 
khameini said in a speech broadcast by tehran radio the iraqi 
regimes attitude during the past two weeks its obstructionist 
behavior regarding the implementation of resolution 598 and its 
excuses have cast doubts on the prospect of achieving peace 
in the light of this situation i look at the prospect of 
achieving peace and an end to the war in the context of resolution 
598 as extremely doubtful and suspect 
he addressed a rally in ahvaz as part of the celebrations 
honoring khomeini and the revolution that brought him to power in 
1979 the president spoke in arabic the tongue of iranians in 
ahvaz the main city in the oil province of khuzestan near the 
iraqi border 
iraqi newspapers have urged soldiers to keep their fingers on 
the trigger and khamenei delivered a similar message 
this enemy has proved that it understands nothing except the 
language of force and of strength he said the armed forces 
and everyone within the nation and volunteer combatants must 
demonstrate and prove that the revolution through its armed and 
military forces is always able to defend its borders 
unless this is demonstrated this enemy will remain a constant 
threat about iraqs demand for direct talks he said 
we shall not accept any preconditions from iraq over the 
implementation of the resolution and a ceasefire on the fronts 
such as direct negotiations or any other condition if iraq sets 
down preconditions we too shall set down a condition and ours will 
be what we have stated before the punishment of the aggressor 
during the year of irans holdout on the resolution it insisted 
there could be no truce until iraq was branded as the aggressor 
iraq invaded iran in september 1980 after several border skirmishes 
resolution 598 provides for a ceasefire withdrawal to 
recognized borders prisoner exchange peace negotiations and an 
investigation of which side started the war 
dispatches from irans official islamic republic news agency 
said scenes in the streets tuesday resembled the joy when khomeini 
returned from exile feb 1 1979 after the late shah mohammad reza 
pahlavi was overthrown 
ayatollah hussein ali montazeri khomeinis designated 
successor organized the rallies 
in tehran participants assembled at the azadi freedom square 
to recite verses from the koran chant slogans and listen to a 
resolution of support for khomeini air force helicopters dropped 
flowers irna said 
the resolution included vows to obey all khomeinis orders 
recognize montazeri as his successor defend the islamic 
revolution remain nonaligned and seek peace with iraq

the governments chief barometer of future 
economic activity soared 14 percent in june in a performance that 
analysts said signaled healthy growth for the rest of the year 
the commerce department said tuesday the increase in its index 
of leading indicators was the sharpest rise in 18 months and 
reflected healthy gains in virtually all of the statistics that 
comprise it 
in other good economic news the government said sales of new 
homes and orders to us factories for manufactured goods also 
posted solid increases 
the 55 percent rise in factory orders was the largest onemonth 
advance in more than 17 years and was propelled by the biggest 
increase in military orders in more than five years 
newhome sales shot up 84 percent to a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 734000 units the fastest sales rate in 16 months 
analysts credited renewed consumer confidence for the rebound in 
sales after a sluggish period earlier this spring 
analysts said the triple dose of strong economic statistics 
should provide cheer for republicans hoping to hold onto the white 
house although it is most certain to renew fears of higher 
inflationary pressures in the months ahead 
the leading index has been up in four of the last five months 
you have to consider that very good news for the economy said 
david wyss chief financial economist for data resources inc 
there is certainly no sign of a recession coming at least for the 
rest of this year 
the economy as measured by the gross national product expanded 
at a healthy 33 percent annual rate in the first six months of 
1988 far better than economists had been expecting following last 
octobers stock market crash 
given the momentum provided by exceptionally strong activity in 
june many analysts said they expected growth in the current 
julyseptember quarter to remain strong as well 
the rapid economic growth helped to push the unemployment rate 
down to a 14year low of 53 percent in june lending rise to 
concerns that tight labor markets will begin to translate in higher 
wage demands and rising inflation 
we have an economy that is cooking along at or near full 
employment the byproduct of that is almost certain to be high and 
accelerating inflation said allen sinai chief economist of the 
boston co but these reports show that the end of the expansion 
is not yet anywhere in sight 
many analysts believe that higher inflationary pressures will 
prompt the federal reserve board to continue its efforts to boost 
interest rates to dampen demand 
the fed in a review of the economy released tuesday noted 
rising prices for a wide variety of materials from metals and paper 
to food the report prepared for fed policymakers said high 
factory operating rates in many industries were beginning to bump 
against capacity restraints 
many analysts say that while the economy will continue to grow 
at a good clip this year the feds efforts to fight inflationary 
pressures could well result in a recession sometime in 1989 
analysts said the increase in the leading index was in part a 
rebound from may when the index had dropped a sharp 08 percent 
after three months of solid gains the june advance was the biggest 
onemonth rise since the index climbed 22 percent in december 1986 
in june the strength in the leading index was widespread with 
seven of the available nine components registering advances 
the biggest source of strength came from a 57 percent rise in 
stock prices as measured by the 500 stocks in the standard amp poors 
index 
other business barometers showing strength were a slowdown in 
business delivery times considered a sign of increasing demand an 
increase in plant and equipment orders a drop in unemployment 
claims an increase in building permits a change in raw materials 
prices and a rise in the money supply 
one indicator orders for consumer goods was a negative factor 
on the index another indicator the length of the average work 
week was unchanged in june 
the 14 percent rise left the overall index at 1940 percent of 
its 1967 base of 100

the volume of world merchandise trade grew by 5 
percent last year and is expected to rise by the same percentage in 
1988 according to a study released wednesday by the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade 
the study by the international trading body paints a more upbeat 
picture of the world economy than one issued in february that 
estimated 4 percent growth in 1987 and 1988 
five consecutive years of growth have brought the volume of 
world trade onequarter above that in 1982 a recession year the 
study said 
trade in manufactures led the expansion with an estimated 55 
percent increase in growth exceeding the average annual increase 
so far this decade the study said 
the report said agricultural trade volume turned in the best 
performance since 1981 with 45 percent growth compared with a 
1 percent decline in 1986 the previous prediction was 4 percent 
however world agricultural output declined for the first time 
since 1950 by an estimated 3 percent largely because of high 
levels of world stocks for major agricultural products the report 
said 
the report also said that the pickup in many agricultural 
prices since the beginning of 1987 has done nothing to reduce the 
urgent need for major reform in traderelated agricultural 
policies which include tradedistorting measures such as 
subsidies and market restrictions 
imports by industrialized countries remained the strongest force 
in world trade expansion though growth slowed to 6 percent from 
85 percent in 1986 the report said 
the volume of imports by developing countries increased by 3 
percent last year after declining 5 percent in 1986 the report 
said growth in those countries exports dropped to 6 percent from 
9 percent 
for 15 heavily indebted developing countries merchandise 
exports in 1987 rebounded after dropping 15 percent in 1986 the 
report said it traced the recovery to firmer oil and metals 
prices and to increased manufactured exports 
imports by those countries argentina bolivia brazil chile 
colombia ivory coast ecuador mexico morocco nigeria peru the 
philippines uruguay venezuela and yugoslavia rose by 7 percent 
last year after stagnating from 1984 to 1986

divisions in its own ranks and 
differences with the military over the communist insurgency have 
weakened the ability of the roman catholic church to influence a 
government it helped catapult to power more than two years ago 
in february 1986 priests and nuns heeded the call of manila 
archbishop cardinal jaime l sin and poured into the streets to 
support the militarycivilian uprising that toppled president 
ferdinand marcos and propelled corazon aquino into office 
the church traditionally has played a strong role in the 
philippines where more than 85 percent of the 59 million people 
are catholic priests in asias only christian country still wield 
considerable influence over the daily lives of parishoners 
but the church now finds its influence on government policy 
reduced especially on the issue of the 19year communist 
insurgency 
the ranks of catholic clergy and laity are split between 
staunchly anticommunist conservatives and those who support many 
of the proclaimed reformist goals of the rebels 
the military has accused many priests and nuns of actively 
supporting the those fighting for the communist new peoples army 
despite the anticommunist stands of sin and others priests from 
the communistdominated christians for national liberation lead 
guerrilla units 
meanwhile military influence over the government has grown 
steadily in the wake of a halfdozen coup attempts put down by 
loyal members of the armed forces 
the clearest sign of the churchs declining influence on 
official policy has been mrs aquinos response to a call by the 
catholic bishops conference of the philippines for a resumption of 
peace talks with the rebel national democratic front 
last month the 115member conference called for a restart of 
peace negotiations which collapsed in january 1987 defense 
secretary fidel ramos has opposed peace talks saying they would 
only serve to give the rebels a propaganda forum 
mrs aquino herself a catholic made no reference to the 
bishops call in last months state of the nation address in 
which she outlined her agenda for the coming year 
instead she said the rebels refusal to lay down their arms had 
given her government the moral basis for war mrs aquino said 
earlier she was amenable to new talks but the rebels must make the 
first move 
the bishops call for talks with the insurgests reflects the 
growing falling out by the church with the aquino government 
columnist amando doronila said in a commentary in the manila 
chronicle newspaper he said the bishops position is certain to 
put pressure on the government to reassess its relationship with 
the church one of mrs aquinos most powerful allies in the 
struggle to overthrow the marcos regime doronila said 
rep venancio garduce former attorney for the conferences 
national secretariat for social action blamed the decline of the 
churchs influence on the inability of its collective leadership to 
assert a strong unified position on key issues 
despite its size however the church has been unable to forge a 
common stand on many issues because it lacks a clearly acknowledged 
leader each diocese technically is independent and answerable only 
to the vatican 
in the may 1987 senate elections sin urged voters to reject 
leftist candidates whom he branded as lepers and openly 
endorsed 11 other candidates angering some bishops as well as 
influential laymen 
in the same election garduce noted that the bishops conference 
lobbied for enactment of a farreaching land reform bill proposed 
last year in the house of representatives 
many prominent legislators including mrs aquinos brother 
rep jose cojuangco opposed the house measure instead the house 
and senate in june approved a compromise version which church 
leaders still accepted 
the church can always adapt garduce said it is too 
compromising 
garduce said the bishops concerned over the governments 
deference to the military backed out of supporting the original 
land reform bill because of army allegations that the church had 
been infiltrated by the communists 
last year the military charged that the churchs social action 
secretariat which coordinates welfare programs was diverting 
funds to the new peoples army 
after an investigation the bishops decided to reorganize the 
secretariat 
the church should be liberational in its approach garduce 
said but then the institutional church probably is aware that 
there will be problems in case this thrust will be continued 
some bishops have complained that the military often charges 
catholic clergy with supporting the rebels simply because of their 
work with the poor 
we regret that our people who are engaged in the work for 
philippine christian communities or social action work are 
suspected sometimes manila bishop teodoro bacani said after a 
recent meeting with military authorities

a senior iraqi official said today his 
government would never accept a ceasefire in the iraniraq war if 
it were declared by the un without iraqs consent 
riyadh alqaysi iraqs former un ambassador also told 
reporters we demand facetoface talks in the interest of real 
peace rather than a temporary truce 
we will not accept a fait accompli no matter in what form or 
from which quarter it comes said alqaysi a member of the iraqi 
delegation in the current un peace talks with the foreign 
ministers of iran and iraq 
on monday secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said he 
would declare a ceasefire in the 8yearold war after receiving 
the report from a un ceasefire team and consulting the security 
council the un chief said he also might consult with 
representatives of iran and iraq 
the dday beginning of a ceasefire does not depend on the 
parties the secretarygeneral said 
his statement fueled speculation that he was trying to pressure 
iraq to drop its demand for facetoface talks before a ceasefire 
and to agree to an early peace iran has been pressing perez de 
cuellar to announce a ceasefire and has said it will comply at 
once 
ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati of iran reaffirmed today 
that his government believes the secretarygeneral is obliged to 
declare a ceasefire even if iraq is opposed 
the secretarygeneral is mandated to declare a ceasefire 
he told reporters after meeting with some members of the security 
council he said iran accepts the secretarygenerals ideas on a 
troop withdrawal prisoner exchange and other elements of a peace 
plan 
earlier today francois giuliani spokesman for the 
secretarygeneral said the un chief does not intend to act 
unilaterally it is not his intention to declare a ceasefire 
unilaterally giuliani said theoretically he can do so 
practically he will consult 
no meetings were scheduled today between the secretarygeneral 
and iranian or iraqi envoys 
irans announcement on july 18 that it was finally accepting a 
yearold un ceasefire resolution came after it suffered a string 
of battlefield defeats and was followed by a series of iraqi raids 
into iran 
iraq accepted the ceasefire resolution last year but has been 
demanding facetoface talks with iran before a truce takes effect 
the announcement of a ceasefire date would put pressure on iraq 
to compromise and drop its insistence on direct talks which have 
hampered a week of unmediated negotiations between the warring 
nations 
the security council resolution provides for a ceasefire 
withdrawal to recognized borders a prisoner exchange peace 
negotiations and an investigation to determine which side started 
the war 
perez de cuellar said a un military team is now in amman 
jordan preparing its report he said he is to receive it on 
wednesday 
i will be in touch with members of the security council and 
then i will decide on a dday the peruvian said 
the secretarygeneral said that once a date for a ceasefire is 
decided he will begin consulting nations that could provide about 
250 military observers to monitor the truce and troop withdrawal 
perez de cuellar on monday held his sixth meeting with velayati 
since talks began last week he has met three times with foreign 
minister tariq aziz of iraq

a friend of the man charged in a church 
bus crash that killed 27 people testified tuesday that he took the 
drivers pickup truck keys away before the accident but returned 
them because he wasnt drunk enough that he couldnt drive 
i had ridden with him earlier that night added taylor fox 
who was at a friends house with larry mahoney before the accident 
he told me he was going home 
but when he watched mahoney leave fox recalled mahoney drove 
past the turn to his house 
fox was among the first witnesses at the hearing by the national 
transportation safety board which is investigating the may 14 
crash ntsb officials have said the hearing will focus mainly on 
drunken driving and bus safety 
ntsb chairman james burnett interviewed tuesday on nbcs the 
today show said the licenses of drunken drivers should be 
revoked on their first offense through a speedy process rather 
than through a process thats severely delayed and the judicial 
system 
asked tuesday whether he would have done anything differently 
fox said i would have kept his keys but you cant predict 
that type of accident 
both fox and phil downey who was also at the house with 
mahoney said mahoney was holding a beer when he pulled up to the 
house a few hours before the crash 
downey said mahoney apparently had had a few but added i 
wouldnt say he was drunk 
an expert on the effects of drinking and driving however 
testified that mahoneys bloodalcohol level of 26 percent more 
than 2 times the legal limit in kentucky would have massively 
impaired his driving ability 
i would estimate that he drank about a case 24 cans of 
beer said dr herbert moskowitz of the southern california researh 
institute 
mahoney 35 has pleaded innocent to 27 counts of murder 13 
counts of firstdegree assault 44 counts of firstdegree wanton 
endangerment and one count of drunken driving 
the crash was the deadliest involving an allegedly drunken 
driver according to the ntsb 
a third witness clint bradley who was heading south to 
louisville shortly before the accident said he saw mahoney pass 
him going south on i71 he said mahoneys truck was weaving and 
tailgating a tractortrailer rig 
bradley got off the interstate at a carrollton exit to buy some 
cigarettes when he returned to the highway he said mahoney was 
heading north in the southbound lane 
bradley said he flashed his lights and honked his horn at him 
the ntsb will report on the crashs probable causes and 
recommend how to avoid similar accidents recommendations could be 
directed toward federal state and local officials as well as bus 
manufacturers but the board has no power to require implementation 
since the crash gov wallace wilkinson ordered officers 
enforcing the states liquor laws to increase inspections of bars 
liquor stores and other establishmentsd that sell alcoholic 
beverages to intoxicated customers

president reagan on tuesday endorsed 
compromise legislation providing compensation payments of 20000 
to americans of japanese descent who were interned during world war 
ii saying the bill will close a sad chapter in american 
history 
the administration had previously objected to some features of 
the bill but reagan said the version approved by a housesenate 
conference committee and passed last wednesday by the senate is 
substantially improved over the versions previously considered 
the house is scheduled to vote on the measure wednesday 
in a letter to house speaker jim wright dtexas and house 
republican leader robert michel rill the president said we 
are particularly pleased that the bill provides for a measured 
disbursement of the amounts authorized for the trust fund 
the compromise sets disbursement of the taxfree payments over a 
10year period for a total cost of more than 1 billion of the 
120000 people of japanese ancestry detained during the war about 
60000 are still alive and eligible for the payments 
reagan said the administration was also glad to see that the 
bill ensures that acceptance of compensation under the 
legislation fully satisifies claims against the united states based 
on the unique circumstances of the internment 
enactment of the bill he said will close a sad chapter in 
american history in a way that reaffirms americas commitment to 
the preservaion of liberty and justice for all

producers and scriptwriters have approached 
each other informally after managements chief negotiator declared 
a deadlock in bargaining to end a crippling 22weekold walkout a 
union spokeswoman said 
the formal talks collapsed saturday but intermediaries made 
contact to determine if a basis existed to resume negotiations 
writers guild of america spokeswoman cheryl rhoden said monday 
we are attempting to get the talks going ms rhoden said 
she said a variety of resources were being used to 
accomplish that but she declined to identify the gobetweens 
the informal contacts spurred optimism among some at guild 
headquarters monday afternoon that a settlement with the alliance 
of motion picture and television producers might be near said two 
sources within the guild 
federally mediated talks had ended early saturday after 
foundering on issues including payments for television reruns on 
sunday the alliances chief negotiator and president nicholas 
counter iii declared the contract talks hopelessly deadlocked 
the 9000member guild blamed the collapse of formal 
negotiations on the alliance while producers have charged the 
guild with making unreasonable demands and refusing to compromise 
the guilds main negotiator meanwhile asked dissident guild 
members to give him until wednesday to resolve the strike 
according to another guild source the sources spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
brian walton executive director of the guild on the west coast 
made the request monday to members who were considering resigning 
the source said 
walton spoke by telephone to the writers coalition group said 
ms rhoden who refused to disclose details of the conversation 
the coalition of 21 writers has pushed for a strike settlement 
under contract terms that the guild has strongly opposed 
the group had threatened to drop out of the strike in the past 
and was expected to resign from the guild this week after a 
fourhour strategy conference monday the coalition announced it 
would continue to honor the walkout that began march 7 
but the dissidents will reconsider whether they should resign if 
the strike continues past weeks end said lionel chetwynd a 
spokesman for the coalition

film studios said monday that their companies will pay any union 
fines incurred by striking scriptwriters who cross pick lines 
jeffrey katzenberg and barry diller the respective heads of 
walt disney studios and 20th century fox made the offers fox 
spokesman michael binkow confirmed dillers offer katzenbergs 
proposal was reported in todays editions of the new york times 
guild fines against strikebreaking writers are set at 110 
percent of all compensation received for unauthorized strike work 
and violators are subject to lifetime expulsion from the guild ms 
rhoden said 
she said that she knew of no movement within union ranks to 
accept the proposal

this summers wildfires 
are exciting scientists over the prospect of a wilderness 
laboratory while dismaying tourism officials faced with fewer 
visitors to the oldest national park 
the fires also have touched off a lively debate about how much 
man should interfere with natures ways in the west 
there is a great scientific interest in this because there 
will be a tremendous release of forage and habitat for wildlife 
yellowstone superintendent robert barbee said tuesday on the 
other hand if you are making your living on tourism you dont 
want to impede tourism to the area 
thats the horns of our dilemma barbee said 
indeed while scientists wait eagerly to reach charred 
backcountry areas to study the effects of the parks most 
extraordinary fire assault in three centuries wyoming and 
yellowstone officials are trying to get the word out that the park 
remains open 
most fires they emphasize are burning in the parks 
backcountry and only two frontcountry areas the grant village 
complex and lewis lake campground near the parks south entrance 
have been closed by the fire 
yellowstone is keeping a relatively normal operation although 
we have minor disruptions from time to time barbee said we 
have thousands of people here the hotels are full the campgrounds 
are full and people havent left yet 
fires that have burned in the park since june now involve some 
140000 acres although not all of the land within fire lines has 
burned creating a mosaic of burned and unburned areas 
and thats the way these forests have already proceeded 
said barbee the fire process has always played itself this way 
throughout the west 
its a rebirth said john varley park biologist one of 
the public perceptions thats hard to deal with is all this talk of 
destruction devastation and damage 
to the ecologist those are all inappropriate terms it is 
really rebirth and renewal it is the end of one cycle of life and 
the beginning of the next varley said 
such fires eliminate old underbrush and stimulate new growth 
while clearing land for wildlife forage 
what is left behind is a rich mosaic of old growth and new 
growth barbee said what occurs then is a whole host of 
different organisms are on the scene it will be black this year 
next year it will be a carpet of green it is opening habitat that 
has been closed for a couple of hundred years 
it is all part of this dynamic process that occurs in nature 
so what is destruction for one person is a reason for champagne 
corks to pop for the next 
nevertheless publicity generated by the blazes is discouraging 
some tourists according to wyoming travel commission director gene 
bryan 
i dont think there is any question the fires are beginning to 
have an impact he said initially with those folks who were 
already on the road and still planning to go it didnt seem to 
have any immediate impact we are beginning to feel it now in some 
key areas 
yellowstone tourism surveys show that when the south entrance 
closed july 23 the parks overall visitation dropped about 20 
percent from 1987 levels 
to combat the perception that the park and northwestern wyoming 
are inaccessible the travel commission is running 60second radio 
advertisements in salt lake city omaha neb and des moines 
iowa to announce that the parks major facilities and attractions 
are open 
the commission has also asked wyomings congressional delegation 
to consider taping public service announcements and to ask 
president reagan to tape one as well 
some groups are taking exception to contentions by the us 
forest service and park service that the fires are good for the 
area 
a number of people have criticized both agencies for their 
policy of allowing naturally caused fires to burn particularly in 
the park and in the bridgerteton national forest 
however because of this summers extremely dry conditions the 
agencies are fighting most new fires regardless of how they started 
park policies do allow for a change in the practice of allowing 
natural fires to burn depending on the conditions a point keith 
hamilton a wyoming farm bureau official in big horn county finds 
difficult to understand 
park and forest officials have been telling the public they 
feel fires are a natural occurrence and should be allowed to 
burn hamilton said but for some strange reason they place 
several hundred firefighters on the line their real policy is 
still a mystery i think they would like to have their cake and eat 
it too

after 17 years hitchhiking across the 
country panhandling for food and living in shelters and a mental 
hospital a 51yearold retarded man has found his family 
its a miracle said frank caswell who has been a patient 
at eastern state hospital since last november he had no 
identification money or additional clothes when a mission for the 
homeless in norfolk sent him to eastern 
caswell was unable to tell workers at the hospital his hometown 
until last month when he said he may have lived in dover nh he 
told social worker martin phillips he thought he had a sister who 
was still alive 
pno one would miss me anyway caswell said monday but he 
said he was eager to return to new hampshire and promised never to 
leave again 
caswells memory loss and an unusual limp had led hospital 
workers to believe he had been a chronic alcoholic actually the 
limp came from his contracting polio in 1949 
the challenge of piecing together his past had been made more 
difficult by false leads he gave the hospital he guessed his age 
to be about 40 and came up with inaccurate names of relatives 
phillips said officials hope caswell can return to new hampshire 
and be reunited with his sister in the next two months 
basically for the last 17 years he has been a mystery man 
phillips said

president reagan said tuesday he will 
reluctantly allow a plantclosing notification bill to become law 
and accused democrats of political shenanigans that had 
jeopardized legislation aimed at curbing the huge us trade 
deficit 
without relenting in his view that requiring 60 days notice of 
plant closings or mass layoffs was wrong reagan conceded that 
political realities rendered a veto of the bill impractical 
the senate leadership refuses to even consider important trade 
legislation until final action is taken on the plantclosing 
bill he said 
reagan and his chief spokesman marlin fitzwater accused 
prolabor democrats in congress of exploiting public sentiment for 
a plantclosing bill to force the administrations hand 
but the national interest now dictates that the majority in 
the congress must be forced to stop playing politics reagan said 
therefore in order to end these political shenanigans and to 
get on with the business of the nation i have decided to allow the 
plant closing bill to become law but without my signature 
the bill becomes law at 1201 am edt thursday but it will not 
be enforced for six months until feb 4 1989 
vice president george bushs staff chief craig fuller said 
reagans decision will make it more difficult for the political 
game to be played over the plantclosing issue in the november 
presidential election 
bush the certain republican presidential nominee has opposed 
mandatory plantclosing notices democratic nominee michael dukakis 
has repeatedly cited bushs position as evidence of his and 
reagans insensitivity to workers 
under the bill notices are required of any employer with at 
least 100 fulltime workers if a plant closing will result in loss 
of jobs for 50 or more of employees 
in case of layoffs notices are required only if onethird of a 
companys employees or 500 of them whichever figure is lower 
are involved 
exemptions are provided if employers can show that plant 
closings or mass layoffs are caused by not reasonably foreseeable 
circumstances such as flood drought or sudden cancellation of a 
major contract or that notices would prevent raising enough 
capital to keep the business open 
the president had vetoed an earlier version of the trade bill 
largely because it included a plantclosing provision and his veto 
was upheld but the house and senate subsequently passed separate 
plantclosing legislation by vetoproof margins 
thus reagan abandoned the fight tuesday in the face of 
virtually certain defeat in congress a veto became untenable when 
republicans deserted reagan apparently because of polls which 
showed that 80 percent of the public favored plantclosing notices 
fiftyfour of the 177 republicans in the house and 19 gop 
senators supported the bill last month enough to muster the 
twothirds majorities in each chamber to override a veto 
fitzwater chided democrats for turning the bill into a 
political football and reagan said some legislators were 
more interested in scoring political points with organized labor 
than in saving workers jobs 
but rep marge roukema rnj dissented the presidents 
done the right thing although i wish he had done it sooner she 
said 
it became an election year issue of fairness and 
compasssion said mrs roukema who had led a gop fight against 
the bill in the house but wound up supporting it 
the heat of the summer is not the only heat the white house 
has been feeling said senate majority leader robert c byrd 
dwva the president has felt the heat from working americans 
who want fair treatment and common decency 
the bills enactment is organized labors biggest legislative 
victory since 1978 when congress last voted to raise the minimum 
wage 
workers their families and their communities will now have a 
better chance to plan for the future said aflcio president lane 
kirkland who called reagans decision long in coming but 
welcome 
the national association of manufacturers and the us chamber 
of commerce had engaged in aggressive grassroots lobbying over the 
past two weeks to pressure reagan to veto the bill 
this has really sent a shock wave through the business 
community said renee reymond the nams chief lobbyist on the 
issue 
she said the plantclosing notices wee part of a broad scheme 
to get many mandated benefits enacted into law instead of through 
the collective bargaining process so that unions can bargain for 
other things 
a bureau of labor statistics study last year indicated that 64 
percent of the workers affected by plant closings or largescale 
layoffs received no advance notice and that another 16 percent were 
told less than two weeks in advance 
supporters of the legislation said it would provide notices to 
800000 workers most of them nonunion who do not receive advance 
warnings as part of collective bargaining contracts

sales of new homes surged 84 percent in june 
as rising mortgage rates spurred the biggest increase in sales in 
four months the government reported tuesday 
the commerce department said sales of new singlefamily homes 
climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 734000 units in 
june the highest sales level since february 1987 
the june increase followed a revised 06 percent decline in home 
sales in may and was the biggest onemonth advance since an 119 
percent sale rise in february the government also revised upward 
the level of sales for march april and may showing more strength 
in the residential market than previously believed 
analysts said these developments were encouraging signs but 
they cautioned against too much optimism primarily because of a 
belief that mortgage rates are headed still higher 
demand is still there as long as interest rates can stay at a 
reasonable level said kent colton executive vice president of 
the national association of realtors but we are concerned that 
for the rest of the year the pressure on rates will be upward 
that means that this is probably the peak as far as sales are 
concerned 
richard peach an economist with the mortgage bankers 
association said part of the sales push in june came from attempts 
by home buyers to close deals before rates went higher 
peach noted that the federal reserve boosted interest rates 
twice in may and once in june in highly publicized moves to dampen 
inflationary pressures 
fixedrate mortgages now stand at 105 percent on average james 
christian chief economist for the us league of savings 
institutions predicted they would hit 11 percent by the end of the 
year 
but even with the continued rise in rates christian predicted 
that newhome sales would total 650000 units this year down only 
3 percent from the 1987 pace 
the upward revisions in sales back through march indicate the 
housing market was doing pretty well through the spring he said 
people have confidence that the economy will remain strong and 
they dont have to worry about going out and making a commitment to 
buy a home 
prices of new homes were up sharply in june with the median 
price at 117800 up 7800 from may the median price means half 
the homes sold for more and half for less 
the average price of a home was up as well climbing 57 percent 
to 141200 
analysts said much of the price increase reflected the 
geographic composition of the sales increase sales were up sharply 
in the northeast and west the two regions with the highest home 
prices 
the sales advance was led by a 289 percent rise in the west 
where sales totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 245000 
units sales in the northeast climbed 155 percent to 119000 units 
sales fell 42 percent in the south to an annual rate of 273000 
units sales were down 1 percent in the midwest to a rate of 97000 
units 
for the first six months of the year newhome sales were 32 
percent lower than in the same period a year ago

the higher postage stamp prices that took

agency reported tuesday 
the mail service said it had net income of 48 million for the 
quarter between march 12 and june 3 in the same quarter a year 
earlier the agency had lost 171 million 
senior assistant postmaster general comer s coppie said 
quarterly revenue was 16 percent higher than expected primarily 
because the new rates took effect a week earlier than originally 
planned and mail volume was higher than anticipated 
in addition the postal service received 10 million in

the countdown for a thursday 
testfiring of space shuttle discoverys main engines proceeded 
tuesday while technicians searched seals fittings and welds for an 
elusive hydrogen leak that could once again delay the vital test 
shuttle managers said they hoped to avoid a fifth postponement 
of a test which is necessary to certify discovery for the first 
shuttle flight since the challenger explosion 2 years ago 
they said they would meet wednesday morning to assess the leak 
situation and decide whether to continue or delay the countdown 
the problem is in a launch pad service mast and not on the 
shuttle itself 
officials said there were indications the leak could be 
temperature related and occur only when hydrogen flowed through the 
service mast into the shuttles fuel tank at a temperature of 423 
degrees below zero necessary to keep it in liquid form 
if that were the case the leak might be difficult to find at 
air temperature and suspect parts might have to be removed and 
subjected to tests in a supercold laboratory chamber 
the leak is in the same service mast as another hydrogen leak 
that developed last friday in a pressure monitoring connector that 
leak was fixed but it forced a threeday delay in a practice 
countdown 
the new leak believed different than the first was detected 
monday while hydrogen was flowing into discoverys tanks during a 
renewed practice countdown the launch team stopped hydrogen 
loading and continued the countdown to conclusion without a full 
load 
a new countdown then was started aiming for the firing of 
discoverys three main engines at 730 am thursday 
the 20second ignition is to test modifications made to 
highspeed turbopumps and other engine systems and to provide the 
launch team with practice in new countdown procedures initiated 
since the challenger accident 
officials believe the practice countdown and firing delays 
combined with an unresolved leak in the spaceships steering 
thruster system could slip the launch date from midseptember into 
october 
nasa has deferred action on the steering thruster leak until 
after the engine test then shuttle managers will determine whether 
to move discovery from the launch pad to a hangar for repairs or if 
engineers should try to fix the leak on the pad by entering the 
shuttles cargo bay and cutting a hole through the rear bulkhead to 
gain access to the thruster compartment 
a fix on the pad would delay the launch about two weeks while 
moving discovery to a hangar could put it off as much as two months

a palestinian who testified at 
the trial of mohammed ali hamadi on tuesday was the second witness 
to link the defendant to the 1985 hijacking of a twa airliner to 
beirut 
hamadi is charged with air piracy and murder in the june 1985 
commandeering of trans world airlines flight 847 to the lebanese 
capital 
chief judge heiner mueckenberger read from a police report in 
which hazma kassin a palestinian recounted a conversation with 
hamadis older brother abbas 
abbas was convicted in april of kidnapping two west germans in 
beirut in an attempt to force west germany to free his younger 
brother abbas was sentenced to 13 years in prison 
one west german alfred schmidt was released in september but 
the second rudolf cordes remains a hostage 
quoting the police report mueckenberger told kassim you told 
police abbas told me that mohammed was arrested because he was a 
hijacker of the american airplane abbas said mohammed is to be 
extradited to the united states abbas didnt say how he knew about 
this but i assume that he had heard it from mohammed 
kassim responded it could be that i told that to the police 
are you afraid to repeat it mueckenberger asked 
no but i cant remember now kassim said in the heavily 
guarded courtroom 
kassim said he lived in lebanon before coming to germany in 
1979 he now lives in the town of merzig in saarland state near 
the former residence of abbas hamadi 
mueckenberger said police questioned kassim after mohammed 
hamadis arrest in january 1987 but did not specify the date 
last week gaazi yazbeck a lebanese man who lives in west 
germany and knows the hamadis said abbas told him that mohammed 
had something to do with the hijacking 
he abbas just said it he was sort of bragging yazbeck 
told the court he said the conversation occurred at a bar in 
saarland state a few weeks after the hijacking 
mohammed hamadi who lived in west germany from 1982 to 1984 
has not been asked directly about the hijacking 
court spokesman falk thomas told reporters tuesday that pilots 
of the hijacked jet are scheduled to testify in september 
flight 847 was seized after taking off from athens on june 14 
1985 and diverted to beirut the gunmen killed us navy diver 
robert stethem and held 39 americans hostage for 17 days 
three other men who were allegedly involved in the hijacking 
remain at large 
mohammed hamadi was arrested at frankfurt airport on jan 13 
1987 after customs officials discovered liquid explosives in his 
luggage 
in a brief exchange tuesday mueckenberger asked hamadi if he 
had been sick the defendant responded i dont want to discuss 
this in public 
thomas later said hamadi has been ill and requested hospital 
treatment when the court recesses for four weeks on aug 9 he 
declined to specify the nature of the illness

orders to us factories for manufactured 
goods advanced in june at the fastest rate in more than 17 years a 
55 percent increase that reflected strong demand for civilian and 
military aircraft the government said tuesday 
the commerce department said orders for both durable and 
nondurable goods hit a record 22984 billion in june following a 
07 percent decline in may 
it was the biggest onemonth increase since a 68 percent rise 
in december 1970 and left economists impressed with the continued 
showing of strength by american manufacturing 
even after you take out defense and civilian aircraft it was 
a very nice number said david wyss chief financial economist 
for data resources inc the manufacturing sector is now 
competitive in world markets 
american manufacturers suffered through lean years earlier in 
the decade because of a huge trade deficit caused by shrinking 
export sales and a big surge in imports the administration 
launched an effort in 1985 to devalue the dollar as a way of making 
imports more expensive and boosting the competitiveness of us 
goods overseas 
the june orders report is another indication that the 
industrial side of the economy is close to a boom said allen 
sinai chief economist of the boston co the strength and 
momentum in orders suggests that the capital spending boom we have 
had will keep going though the rest of the year 
much of the overall strength in the economy in the first half of 
1988 has come from the improvement in the trade deficit and a big 
rise in business investment as manufacturers expanded production 
facilities to meet the rising export demand 
the june orders increase came from a 101 billion rise in 
transportation orders which jumped to 382 billion 359 percent 
over the may level the increase included a 52 billion rise in 
demand for military aircraft and a 46 billion rise in 
shipbuilding and tanks 
overall the volatile defense category shot up 786 percent the 
biggest increase since december 1982 without the rise in military 
demand total orders would have risen by a smaller but still 
healthy 27 percent 
the category of nondefense capital goods rose 132 percent to 
3576 billion reflecting in large part the increase in civilian 
aircraft orders most placed with the seattlebased boeing co 
total orders for durable goods items expected to last three or 
more years rose 94 percent to 1259 billion this represented a 
slight upward revision from an advance report a week ago that put 
the increase in durable goods at 88 percent 
orders for primary metals such as steel fell by 33 percent the 
only major sector to post a decline during the month 
orders for nondurable goods rose 12 percent to 10403 
billion reflecting increases in demand for food clothing paper 
and petroleum products 
shipments of manufactured goods rose 15 percent in june to 
2206 billion with over half of that increase coming in the 
durable goods sector

south africa on tuesday 
proposed a ceasefire next month in the angolan war that would lead 
to a withdrawal of foreign troops from angola and independence for 
southwest africa by next june 
foreign minister pik botha speaking in the capital of pretoria 
said south african delegates made the offer tuesday in geneva 
where a new round of peace talks began 
the talks involve south africa angola cuba and us mediators 
the proposal marked the first time south africa has offered a 
specific date for granting independence to southwest africa also 
known as namibia and was seen as a major development in efforts to 
resolve the 13yearold angolan war 
if these proposals are accepted it is the south african 
governments firm belief that there will be no losers botha said 
the sovereignty of angola will be without question southwest 
africa will have gained independence and peace will have been 
restored he said 
botha said that if the ceasefire offer is accepted south 
africa would withdraw its estimated 3000 troops from southern 
angola by sept 1 
on nov 1 south africa would begin withdrawing from southwest 
africa under the guidelines of un resolution 435 which calls for 
independence in the territory 
botha said the south african proposal envisions elections in 
southwest africa on june 1 1989 provided cuba has withdrawn its 
estimated 50000 troops from angola by the same date 
cuba and angola did not immediately comment on the proposal and 
botha said he could not say how they had responded at the geneva 
talks 
cuban troops are in angola supporting the countrys marxist 
government south africa and the united states support the rebels 
of the national union for the total independence of angola unita 
the south african proposal calls for the ceasefire to be 
monitored by committees established at the current round of talks 
in geneva bothas statement did not specify who would do the 
monitoring although in the past he has proposed a un presence 
botha said that if a ceasefire were to begin aug 10 it would 
give un officials almost three months to prepare for south 
africas withdrawal from southwest africa under the terms of 
resolution 435 
south africa backed by the united states has insisted that 
independence for southwest africa must be linked with a cuban 
troop withdrawal from angola 
cuba and angola have suggested a fouryear timetable for the 
cuban withdrawal while the south africans and the united states 
are seeking a much shorter time period 
south africas mandate over southwest africa was terminated by 
the united nations in 1966 but in defiance of several un 
resolutions it has retained control of the country which 
possesses considerable mineral wealth 
among other issues addressed by the south african proposal are 
the southwest africa peoples organization whose guerrillas 
have been fighting for independence for 22 years south africa says 
they must stop launching raids into southwest africa from their 
bases in southern angola 
african national congress bases in angola south africa says 
the anc the main black group fighting to overthrow south africas 
white government has seven major military bases in angola and the 
pretoria government wants those bases closed down 
financial assistance for namibia south africa spends billions 
of dollars annually on southwest africa it is looking for someone 
else to help the territory pay its bills and has suggested the 
five permanent members of the united nations security council 
the south african plan does not mention unita the groups 
leader jonas savimbi wants a powersharing accord with the 
angolan government but the countrys marxist leaders have so far 
refused to negotiate with the guerrilla movement 
none of the negotiating teams in geneva made any comments 
following tuesdays session the talks were scheduled to continue 
wednesday and thursday 
the geneva talks are the fifth round of negotiations started in 
may participants agreed last month on a basic set of 14 principles 
that would lead to the withdrawal of all foreign forces from angola 
and the granting of independence to namibia no timetable was 
agreed on

stronger sanctions are needed to counter 
increased repression and censorship in south africa a meeting of 
commonwealth foreign ministers was told tuesday 
studies show that sanctions are working but could bite 
harder said commonwealth secretarygeneral shridath ramphal 
he told the ministers from eight commonwealth nations reviewing 
the fight against apartheid that south africa has reason to feel 
secure 
the sharply increased censorship and repression of the past 
six months has drawn only verbal responses the apartheid regime 
long ago learned to ignore these ritual condemnations and it is 
growing increasingly confident that its major trading partners in 
the west are not prepared to widen tighten and intensify 
sanctions ramphal said 
britain which opposes sanctions was conspicuous by its absence 
from the committee of foreign ministers canadas joe clark is 
chairman and the other envoys are from australia guyana india 
nigeria tanzania zambia and zimbabwe 
the committees task is to counter south african censorship and 
propaganda study security problems facing the black frontline 
states review the economic impact of sanctions and examine south 
africas continuing financial links around the world 
canada has organized a rekindle the light festival of 
concerts and public forums to coincide with the twoday meeting 
climaxed by the lighting of candles on the shores of lake ontario 
and in homes tuesday night 
the south african government fought back tuesday with a 
fullpage advertisement in the globe and mail the nations leading 
newspaper which accused the commonwealth envoys of slander and 
hypocrisy 
signed by south african ambassador hendrik de klerk the ad said 
five of the eight commonwealth countries represented in toronto 
have press restrictions equal to or more stringent than south 
africa 
we resent as do south africans of all colors being singled 
out for special condemnation 
it said more than 100 discriminatory laws have been abolished in 
south africa in the past decade and claimed great improvements in 
black income education and housing sanctions rejected by the 
majority of blacks frustrate this progress 
but clark blasted south africa for its crackdown on free speech 
including the refusal to grant a travel visa to cyril rhamaposa 
head of the south african miners union so he could attend the 
toronto meeting 
in presenting a false image to the world the government of 
south africa is also pretending to itself clark said we will 
consider individual new steps until the system of apartheid is 
ended 
canada made censorship the theme of the meeting and will propose 
measures such as establishing a shortwave radio service from 
neighboring countries 
but ramphals speech underlined concern by many delegates to 
keep the focus on economic sanctions 
in the absence of sanctions apartheid will persist and the 
cycle of violence will only intensify effective sanctions have 
been withheld apartheid has persisted the cycle of violence has 
intensified 
ramphal welcomed new sanctions that have been proposed in the 
us congress and threatened by the european community south 
africa is immune to antiapartheid gestures it is only action that 
will bring the whole sordid system down he said 
in south africa the department of foreign affairs called the 
commonwealths actions in canada a blatant interference in the 
domestic affairs of south africa 
jw meiring deputy minister of foreign affairs called in 
canadian ambassador rs maclean to express south africas 
objections to the scheduled events 
the department statement said the south african government 
objected to the biased selectivity of the canadian government 
by these actions the canadian government does not contribute in any 
way constructively toward achieving a peaceful solution to the 
problems of southern africa

a list of the most soughtafter books in the 
soviet union this summer shows readers are clamoring for works like 
anatoly rybakovs children of the arbat and other novels born 
in the age of glasnost or released after years on the censors 
shelves 
the government newspaper izvestia ranked the most popular works 
of literature in an article that urged larger printings of books 
both in hardbound novel form for library sales and in the 
circulation of monthly magazines that serialize major books 
izvestia said monday it determined the 12 most popular books in 
the soviet union based on waiting lists at library reading halls 
where soviets can sign up for a turn to read the works on the 
premises 
some books can be checked out of libraries but works with an 
especially strong following are kept at the libraries to prevent 
theft fines for books that arent returned are a fraction of what 
it might cost on the black market 
most of the books occupying the top spots on the soviet list 
compiled by izvestia are stories written years ago but banned by 
authorities or held back by the authors for fear of censorship 
children of the arbat written two decades ago and is the 
most popular book among soviet readers according to the newspaper 
it takes the reader into the life of a student persecuted and 
exiled during the 1930s under josef stalin it was published last 
month in the united states by little brown and co 
stalins repressions feature in several of the best sellers 
including no 2 white clothing about soviet scientists 
manipulation of genetic research in the late 1940s and no 6 the 
golden cloud slumbered recounting the horrors perpetrated on 
soviet ethnic groups exiled for alleged collaboration with the 
nazis during world war ii 
other works popular with readers now were held back by soviet 
censors for decades like boris pasternaks doctor zhivago a 
sympathetic account of the hardships endured by an aristocratic 
doctor following the 1917 bolshevik revolution izvestia said 
pasternaks work for which he won the 1958 nobel prize is the 
fourth most popular book among soviets it was released two years 
ago in a limited printing mostly sold to foreigners for hard 
currency and early this year was serialized in the monthly magazine 
novy mir 
serial printings in masscirculation magazines like novy mir 
offer the best access to new releases for most soviets even the 
most popular books are issued in relatively small quantities in 
comparison with demand 
but the periodicals are usually available only by subscription 
and they are relatively costly for soviet pensioners and others 
with low incomes 
izvestia complained that soviet publishers waste their limited 
resources producing political tomes and brochures that few want to 
read as a result waiting lists for popular books at public 
libraries have more than tripled in the past year the newspaper 
said 
izvestia pressed state publishers to redirect resources so the 
avid reading public would not have to waste so much time waiting in 
line for books 
economists have calculated that for various goods and services 
we stand in lines for 65 billion manhours a year the newspaper 
said of the soviet unions 284 million citizens but the time we 
have to spend in pursuit of culture is no less expensive 
part of the increase in interest at public libraries has been 
the release of thousands of previously banned works 
the newspaper soviet culture reported in march that glavlit the 
state body which since 1922 has been responsible for censorship is 
conducting a review of 6000 books held in special detention 
storehouses 
of the 4000 titles reviewed by spring 3500 had been returned 
to library shelves the newpaper reported 
izvestia said no 3 in popularity among soviets is favorite 
by valentin pikul about one of catherine the greats lovers 
grigory potemkin 
following no 4 doctor zhivago was alexander beks the new 
appointment which portrays a bureaucrats fall from power 
izvestia ranked the remaining books as follows no 6 the 
golden cloud slumbered by anatoly pristavkin no 7 the 
chopping block by chingiz aitmatov no 8 the godfather by 
american writer mario puzo no 9 onward onward onward a 
play by mikhail shatrov no 10 life and fate by vasily 
grossman no 11 history of the government of russia by 
nikolai karamzin and no 12 the master and margarita by 
mikhail bulgakov

a maple syrup producer has agreed to pay 
25000 in fines as part of a settlement following allegations that 
the firm mislabeled maple products 
maple grove farms of vermont inc in st johnsbury neither 
admitted nor denied any wrongdoing but it agreed to pay the fines 
to the state and to reimburse the 10000 it cost the vermont 
department of agriculture to investigate the matter 
the company also agreed to make a 15000 donation to maple 
research at the university of vermont 
the complaint included allegations that the company labeled 
maple syrup at a higher grade than it should have been and sold 
products carrying labels such as pure vermont maple candy that 
included cane sugar 
maple grove president william callahan iii said in a prepared 
statement that the company was being taken out to the woodshed 
for some problems beyond our control and others for which we can 
make little argument 
he said the company agreed to the fine to avoid a costly legal 
battle 
the settlement followed an investigation by the attorney 
generals office 
weve just come through the two absolute worst years in the 
maple business not only in terms of quantity but also in terms of 
quality callahan said in a telephone interview it was 
difficult to have syrup at the higher end of grade range it would 
not withstand the test of time 
as part of the settlement maple grove is to notify customers 
that some sryup sold in 1987 and during the first three months of 
1988 may have darkened fallen below grade or been misgraded some 
changes in labeling also were agreed upon on containers that 
contain syrup not produced in vermont 
maple grove also agreed to recall maple candy sold between april 
1987 and april 1988 the candy is to be relabeled as a 
mapleflavored product or destroyed 
steven wallach of the vermont department of agriculture said 
that while inspectors are continously sampling maple products no 
other companies were involved in this investigation

flying enthusiasts from brazil to australia 
have gathered here for what some call an aviation paradise where 
supersonic jets fly over the countryside pilots discuss the latest 
innovations and flying families camp under the wings of planes 
they are here for the 36th annual experimental aircraft 
association flyin and convention an estimated 1 million people 
and 14000 planes are expected to visit wittman field before the 
weeklong convention ends friday 
people who are into airplanes are airplane nuts and this is 
like mecca to us and well do anything to get to oshkosh said 
frank stankiewicz 53 of fort meyers fla 
thousands of them crowd the flight line during the daily 
airshows to watch a flyby of the supersonic concorde or see a 
wildcat flyer a biplane crop duster lace the sky with looping 
ribbons of pink yellow and white smoke 
they fill workshop tents where they learn tips for making wings 
and tails out of metal or wood and exhibit halls where they can see 
the weather mapping systems 
they also attend seminars where they can learn such things as 
how to prepare your aircraft and safety precautions when 
painting or the basics of friction wear and lubrication 
some camp under the wings of the planes parked wingtip to 
wingtip that fill much of the 1200 acres in the convention area 
others park in nearby grounds or drive 50 miles away to green bay 
for a hotel room 
as an aviator and pilot i wouldnt miss it for the world 
t allan mcartor federal aviation administration administrator 
said tuesday 
mcartor whose agency adds about 40 extra air traffic 
controllers to help direct planes during the convention called it 
the biggest gathering of the clan in general aviation 
for nine days before and during the convention wittman field 
becomes the worlds busiest airport with between 57000 and 60000 
takeoffs and landings said zonnie fritsche faa oshkosh control

brazil 64 from england 165 from australia and 51 from japan had

the aircraft displayed and in many cases flown include the b1b 
bomber a marine corps harrier vertical takeoff and landing jet 
the goodyear blimp vintage world war ii fighters and bombers and 
homebuilt airplanes constructed by association members 
convention chairman tom poberezny whose father paul founded 
the eaa in 1953 said the planes may draw the crowds but the real 
reason people come is for the company of other aviation buffs 
the eaa attracts such people as neil armstrong the first man to 
walk on the moon and the crew that flew around the world in the 
lightweight voyager aircraft 
where else could you talk to the captain of the concorde or

a pilots decision to make an unorthodox 
landing approach using an abrupt reduction in speed led to the 
march 1987 commuter plane crash at detroit in which nine people 
were killed federal investigators concluded tuesday 
the national transportation safety board faulted david sherer 
45 of crestline ohio the pilot of the northwest airlink commuter 
plane for the crash investigators said he was unable to control 
his aircraft after he deliberately put its propellers in 
reverse pitch to hasten his descent 
the technique which the pilot has used at least three times 
previously was contrary to the airlines procedures and against 
common sense and proper pilot techniques board vice chairman 
james kolstad told reporters 
the ntsb said the nine crash victims probably would have 
survived had the plane not been engulfed in flames kolstad said 
all nine died of smoke inhalation and burns rather than injuries 
suffered from the impact of the crash 
the board urged the federal aviation administration to expand 
its requirements for materials blocking fire and toxic smoke in 
smaller commuter aircraft such as the 22seat casa 212 plane that 
crashed at detroit the faa requires such protection in large jet 
aircraft 
the twinengine airlink turboprop flight 2268 was carrying 19 
people when it came in for a landing at detroits metropolitan 
airport on march 4 1987 and went out of control 
the plane cartwheeled onto a taxiway and slid upside down into a 
service vehicle before it burst into flames it narrowly missed a 
jetliner taking on passengers at a gate 
the plane was operated by fischer bros aviation but flew under 
the name northwest airlink because of a marketing agreement with 
northwest airlines 
the ntsb said the probable cause of the accident was the 
captains inability to control the airplane in an attempt to 
recover from an asymmetrical power condition following his 
intentional use of a reverse power propeller position during 
descent 
the investigation showed that the pilot had used a similar 
approach technique on at least three previous occasions in an 
attempt to bring his plane down rapidly and land on the numbers 
near a taxiway turnoff to airlinks gate 
sherer as well as the copilot and seven passengers were killed 
in the crash 
one investigator compared the technique used by sherer in 
attempting to land flight 2268 as a slam dunk onto the runway 
during the approach according to the ntsb the pilot switched 
the twinengine aircraft into socalled beta mode where the 
propellers are positioned to provide reverse power instead of 
normal positive power this position is similar to reverse engine 
thrust in a jet aircraft and is used to slow the plane once on the 
ground 
when such a technique is used while a plane is airborne it has 
the effect of causing a rapid descent but in the case of flight 
2268 the pilot lost control of the aircraft the board said 
sherers problems may have been aggravated by a 
higherthannormal fuel flow setting for both the planes engines 
which caused a speed increase as the plane approached the runway 
the ntsb also suggested that sherer might have been concerned 
about the presence of a northwest airlines dc9 which was on the 
runway preparing to depart

the chief of an association of beer 
distributors voiced support tuesday for a bill that would encourage 
states to crack down on drunken drivers 
beer wholesalers dont need the business of drunk drivers 
ronald r rumbaugh president of the national beer wholesalers 
association told the senate commerce consumer subcommittee we 
dont want their business in fact we want to put them out of 
business 
the subcommittee heard from rumbaugh and other private and 
government officials about proposed legislation offering increased 
federal aid to states that adopt several strict plans intended to 
prevent traffic accidents caused by drunken drivers 
among them are the immediate confiscation of a drivers license 
when the operator fails a chemical test for intoxication or refuses 
to take such a test the state would have 15 days to suspend the 
license or return it to the operator 
twentythree states and the district of columbia already have 
programs in which drivers licenses can be suspended through 
administrative action rather than by the courts according to the 
insurance institute for highway safety 
by encouraging states to adopt tough laws that have proven to 
be effective the bill will save lives said sen frank 
lautenberg dnj the measures chief sponsor 
an official of the national highway traffic safety 
administration said his agency opposed the legislation 
george reagle associate administrator for traffic safety said 
the bill had such tight procedures such as allowing only 15 days 
to decide on license suspensions that most states would not be 
able to benefit from it

the daily yediot ahronot said it said the jewish leader met with 
hussein before the jordanian monarchs announcement sunday that he 
was cutting legal and administrative ties with the west bank

agreed to direct talks between israel and a joint 
jordanianpalestinian delegation under the aegis of an

that he still abided by the london agreement 
throughout the occupied territories palestinians shuttered 
shops and halted transport for a second straight day to protest 
israels deportation policy 
the strike was fueled by the expulsion monday of eight more 
palestinians accused of inciting the rebellion the expulsion 
brought the number of deportations since the uprising began to 29 
the chief army prosecutor lt col amnon strasnov described 
the deportees as encouragers and inciters in the territories who 
have played a substantial role in the uprising

began talks in april with iranian officials accompanying victims of 
chemical weapon attacks in the iraniraq war who were taken to new

really want to solve this problem witcher said in an interview 
after addressing the lambeth conference of anglican bishops in 
canterbury 
the resolution which welcomed un efforts for a ceasefire in 
the 8yearold war also condemned the use of chemical weapons and

sixteen months after it was appointed a panel 
that looked into the handling of drug abuse allegations against 
former state sen julian bond by his wife has concluded its work 
with only one recommendation that standard operating procedures 
in the atlanta police bureau be redefined 
the committee of civic leaders was appointed by mayor andrew 
young in april 1987 to look into how police and other city 
officials handled alice bonds allegations that her estranged 
husband and other prominent atlantans abused cocaine bond denied 
using drugs 
in its report to the mayor monday the panel did not address the 
conduct of any city officials 
cochairmen jesse hill jr and thomas r williams wrote that the 
redefinition of police procedures the panel called for will 
probably occur during the police departments national 
accreditation review which the panel understands is presently 
under way 
however if this does not occur a management study of the 
department and its standard operating procedures should be 
conducted 
young really didnt have anything to say about the report 
said his spokesman nehl horton he thanked them for their hard 
work 
public safety commissioner george napper could not be reached 
for comment he was testifying tuesday in washington before a 
senate committee about gun control 
mrs bond made her allegations to atlanta police narcotics 
investigators in march 1987 
she later withdrew the allegations after a call from young 
there were accusations at the time that the mayor pressured mrs 
bond and that the white officers who talked to her manipulated the 
statement to implicate black officials 
the panel made five observations about the police bureau in its 
report 
it said standard operating procedures frequently were not 
followed that levels of competence in the police bureau are 
varied that residual racial problems exist in the bureau that 
internal security and confidentiality are lax and that discipline 
is inconsistently administered 
the bulk of the sixpage report complained about roadblocks to 
the panels work resulting from media and court activities saying 
we regret the combination of circumstances that rendered 
concerned wellmeaning citizens not as effective in this challenge 
for our community as we would have preferred 
the initial delay came with the investigation by the federal 
grand jury this investigation resulted in no indictments the next 
delay came with the request from the atlanta journal and the 
atlanta constitution that all of the panels meeting be opened to 
all media and the public 
the panels refusal of that request resulted in a lawsuit that 
eventually resulted in a ruling from the georgia supreme court that 
the panel was not subject to the states open meetings laws 
the panel did not meet during those court proceedings 
the investigation also was hindered by a restraining order 
obtained by radio and televison stations that prohibited the 
atlanta police departments office of professional standards from 
handing over the socalled bond report a review of the charges 
without this report the panel without any funding to employe 
investigators or other staff was stymied in its efforts to conduct 
a timely and adequate review the report said 
its subpoena power had been declared illegal by the supreme 
court of georgia it was clear that the newspapers and television 
stations had as much or more documentation of relevant information 
in that they had obtained copies of the alice bond interview tape 
the confidential memo from the interview officers directed to 
chief morris redding summarizing the alice bond interview as 
well as a copy of the complete detailed office of professional 
standards report 
in addition the panel said the mayors pardon of all police 
officers mooted most of what remained for the panels 
investigation and it decided its work was concluded

the united states is examining creation of an 
international peacekeeping force as a way to prevent the khmer 
rouge from resuming power in cambodia the state department said 
tuesday 
the proposal is one of several that were explored in talks last 
week between the vietnameseinstalled government in phnom penh and 
three guerrilla factions seeking to overthrow the rulers said 
spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
other state department officials said discussions on the 
possibility of a peacekeeping force were in a very preliminary 
stage and thus it was too early to tell which nations including 
the united states might supply troops for it 
a peacekeeping force would be designed to take over from the 
vietnamese troops who are scheduled to withdraw from the country by 
1990 vietnam and other countries are fearful that the vacuum left 
by the pullout would allow the murderous khmer rouge group to take 
over cambodia 
the khmer rouge who were accused of killing hundreds of 
thousands of cambodians during their threeyear rule were replaced 
by vietnam when it invaded cambodia in 1978 
some khmer rouge found refuge in china and neighboring thailand 
while others stayed in cambodia and joined the antigovernment 
rebels 
china has reportedly promised to cease its support for the khmer 
rouge if vietnam pulls out 
in a television interview tuesday rep stephen solarz dny 
urged the united states and other western governments to prevent 
the reemergence of the khmer rouge which he said could very 
easily lead to another holocaust in cambodia 
i think the west needs to do much more than what it has been 
doing in order to prevent such a dreadful eventuality from coming 
about solarz chairman of the house foreign affairs subcommittee 
on asian and pacific affairs said on the cbs this morning 
program 
we would support any reasonable measures to prevent the return 
of the khmer rouge and to safeguard the right of the cambodian 
people to choose their own destiny said mrs oakley 
but the shape of a final settlement depends on direct 
negotiations between the key parties and must be in the context of 
agreement on complete withdrawal of vietnamese troops she added 
the firstever talks between the sides last week in indonesia 
failed to achieve a breakthough although working groups were set up 
to negotiate and make recommendations by years end 
testifying before the senate foreign relations committee on 
tuesday another state department official said an international 
peacekeeping force is one of several options being considered to 
prevent the khmer rouge from again taking power in cambodia 
crafting a solution will not be easy said david lambertson 
deputy assistant secretary of state for south east asia the 
khmer rouge remain probably the most militarily powerful of the 
cambodian factions 
lambertson said options advanced by cambodias neighbors and by 
prince norodom sihanouk the nations former ruler include holding 
internationally supervised elections 
we cannot imagine the cambodian people would willingly vote 
for the return of the khmer rouge lambertson said 
he said other options include removing pol pot and other khmer 
rouge leaders most responsible for crimes against the cambodian 
people and disarming all cambodian political factions 
also under consideration he said are a cutoff of the flow of 
arms from outside cambodias borders we believe some combination 
of these or other approaches could prove effective lambertson 
said 
lambertson said the united states also believes it is important 
to maintain diplomatic pressure against vietnam until it has 
completely withdrawn its troops from cambodia 
he reiterated that the reagan administration opposes legislation 
under discussion in congress to establish diplomatic interest 
sections in hanoi and washington to expand contacts between the two 
nations 
lambertson said such a step now would be seen as a major 
political victory by hanoi and a sign by the noncommunist 
resistance inside cambodia as a deeply discouraging signal of a 
weakened american commitment 
under pressure from the soviet union vietnam has promised to 
pull out its estimated 120000 troops by 1990 but has demanded 
assurances that the khmer rouge will not return 
the soviet union and china have scheduled an unusual meeting in 
peking later this month to discuss a cambodian settlement 
china has told the united states that soviet cooperation on the 
cambodia issue could remove one of the remaining obstacles to a 
toplevel summit meeting between the two communist giants who have 
been at odds for more than 30 years

a federal magistrate tuesday refused a 
request by two newspapers to release documents relating to a search 
by federal agents of three unisys corp offices as part of the 
pentagon procurement probe 
us magistrate j earl cudd agreed with the governments 
position that release of search warrants affidavits and other 
documents would jeopardize the federal investigation into possible 
illegalities in defense department contracting 
the court finds that preserving the sensitivity of the ongoing 
criminal investigation is a sufficiently compelling interest to 
justify denial of public access cudd wrote in his decision 
the star tribune and st paul pioneer press dispatch had sought 
access to the documents 
were going to appeal said tim mcguire star tribune 
managing editor its a matter of important public interest the 
progress of this investigation demands press scrutiny 
cudd said the sealed material contains sensitive information 
identifying people who are the focus of the investigation their 
activities and programs being investigated as well as documents 
the government hopes to obtain 
were this information made public there is a substantial 
probability the investigation would be irreparably damaged cudd 
wrote 
he said he was concerned about the possibility that documents 
might be destroyed and witnesses might attempt to tailor their 
accounts of events if they knew the scope and direction of the 
investigation 
the court is also concerned that disclosure would interfere 
with the legitimate privacy of persons whose conversations were 
intercepted during authorized wiretaps and who are therefore 
mentioned in the affidavits but who upon further investigation 
may not be criminally culpable cudd wrote 
although cudd acknowledged that release of the documents would 
be in the public interest he found that disclosure at this 
preliminary stage would unnecessarily subject innocent third 
parties to the risk of serious injury 
patrick schiltz attorney for the star tribune argued at a july 
22 hearing that keeping the search warrants and affidavits sealed 
is pointless because any reasonably informed observer could 
make a good guess as to what is involved in the investigation 
simply by reading newspapers 
but assistant us attorney thor anderson told the magistrate 
that because the information was printed in newspapers doesnt 
make it accurate 
fbi agents on june 13 searched three offices at the unisys plant 
in eagan unisys plants elsewhere in the country and offices of 
other major defense contractors in 11 other states and the district 
of columbia 
the eagan facilities of unisys defense systems make mainframe 
computers for the us defense department no weapons are made at 
the facilities and most of the computers are used by the navy 
other news organizations are seeking release of similar 
documents around the country 
last week the new head of the minneapolis fbi office said he 
expects indictments and guilty pleas in the twin cities area as 
part of the national defense procurement investigation

a federal judge tuesday imposed fines that could 
bankrupt the city of yonkers because of its defiance of a housing 
desegregation order and suggested that gov mario cuomo remove 
recalcitrant council members from office 
there does have to come a moment of truth a moment of 
responsibility a moment when the city of yonkers seeks not to 
become the national symbol of defiance to civil rights heaping 
shame upon shame upon itself said district judge leonard sand 
ruling that yonkers was in contempt for not approving his plan 
to desegregate housing sand fined the city 100 for the first day 
and said the amount would double each succeeding day after 22 
days the fines would swallow the citys entire 337 million budget 
sand also found three of four councilmen who voted against his 
plan in contempt and fined them 500 a day the fourth had his case 
adjourned so he could get a lawyer the judge also said the council 
members could go to jail if they remain in contempt until aug 10 
the council members have said they would appeal the contempt 
finding and the penalties but no quick hearing is likely and all 
previous attempts to appeal sands rulings have failed 
sands action came after two years of threats against yonkers 
for failing to build low and middleincome housing after he ruled 
i 1985 that the city had segregated housing and schools 
intentionally over a 40year period it was the first time a judge 
had tied school segregation to housing segregation 
on monday night the city council voted 43 against the 
courtordered package of bonuses financial incentives and zoning 
variances to attract developers to build 800 units of affordable 
housing throughout the city 
michael sculnick the citys outside counsel asked the judge 
not to fine the city because it was the council not the city 
which had taken the action the fines would ruin the citys fiscal 
standing he said noting that moodys investors service has said a 
contempt finding would jeopardize the citys bond rating 
but sand said the council had been aware of the implications of 
its actions all along and called its action a competition to see 
who can attract the greatest notoriety who will be the 
political martyr without regard for what is in the best interest of 
the city of yonkers 
saying the council was unable to govern in a fiscally 
responsible manner sand urged the state to step in 
the city was saved from bankruptcy in 1984 by a state bailout 
and has its finances supervised by a staterun emergency financial 
control board which can remove council members for fiscal 
irresponsibility 
when sculnick said that might be an unfair burden on the state 
sand angrily replied unfair to have a responsibility when a city 
of almost 200000 totters on the brink of bankruptcy makes itself 
a symbol of defiance to a federal court and acts in a manner so 
devastatingly adverse to the interest of its citizens its too 
much to ask state officials to respond 
after the ruling a spokesman for the governor said only that 
cuomos office and the financial control board were monitoring the 
situation on monday cuomo said it would be inappropriate for 
the state to intervene 
mayor nicholas wasiscko who has supported the desegregation 
plan said he would contact cuomo tuesday but would not ask for the 
removal of council members 
if the council doesnt reverse its opposition to the plan and 
the state doesnt intervene sand could form a housing commission 
to build the new housing without council approval 
attorneys for nicholas longo peter chema and edward fagan said 
they opposed the plan because of procedural deficiencies in the 
resolution sand set an evidentiary hearing for monday but still 
found them in contempt 
vice mayor henry spallone the most vociferous opponent 
appeared without a lawyer and had his case adjourned until at least 
wednesday 
fagan said he would consider resigning from the council but 
longo and spallone said they would not resign chema declined 
comment 
after the court session officials were greeted outside the 
courthouse by about 100 demonstrators chanting dont get mad 
get a new mayor referring to wasisckos support for the plan 
and no justice no peace

a community college has been fined 3000 
as a result of an investigation ordered after the death of a 
student who was given the wrong liquid to drink in a laboratory 
experiment 
pierce college was cited monday for 10 violations of safety 
procedures and fined for failing to implement a program to inform 
employees about hazardous chemicals said barbara dunn of the state 
department of labor and industries 
the school failed to carry out a hazardous communication 
program for handling chemicals 10 months after first being cited 
for that shortcoming ms dunn said the college had the program in 
writing but had not implemented it she said 
school president brent knight said safety programs had been 
improved and the fine would be appealed 
the investigation followed the death of dawn collins 29 of 
puyallup on june 5 four days after she drank a solution during a 
urinalysis experiment in an anatomy and physiology class 
the experiment called for a simple saline solution basically 
salt water but instead she was mistakenly given a solution 
containing sodium azide a preservative 
richard montecucco an assistant attorney general investigating 
the case said a lab technician apparently used a premixed saline 
solution containing sodium azide rather than mixing the solution 
using salt tablets and water 
ms dunn said her agency which investigates accidents involving 
workers was not legally required to reinspect the school after the 
womans death since she was not a college employee but she said 
it decided to do so because it was very obvious the school had 
not complied with the order issued in august 
the latest citations were praised by jack connelly an attorney 
for the collins family who said he was preparing a lawsuit against 
the college 
its very apparent in dawn collins case that the appropriate 
measures were not followed and somebody should have known what was 
in that container connelly said 
investigators found improperly labeled chemicals at the school 
their 11page report said 
a halfgallon metal container with tape marked poison on the 
side was found in the art building and an unmarked brass can of 
lithotine a toxic mineral spirit with pine oil was in the art 
building storage room ms dunn said 
one violation said college employees including lab workers 
were not given information and training on hazardous chemicals in 
their work areas 
knight however contended that officials of the 8000student 
school in the suburbs south of the city had been working to meet 
the requirements of a workers right to know law adopted in 
1986 the law requires employers to inform employees of hazardous 
chemicals in the workplace and have available information on 
procedures for chemical emergencies 
the state agency fined the college 240 last september for seven 
violations including lack of programs for accident prevention or 
handling hazardous materials college officials appealed and the 
fine was reduced to 60 which was paid in november said agency 
spokesman rolland lund 
the first citations resulted from an investigation after an 
employee was burned when an electric spraypainter came in contact 
with flammable liquid 
last month a washington state patrol bomb squad removed 13 
liters more than four gallons of hazardous outdated ether from 
the schools science labs during a cleanout of lab chemicals

the federal government proposed tougher 
uniform standards tuesday for clinical laboratories in an effort to 
ensure the accuracy of pap smears and other tests 
the proposed rules published in the federal register apply to 
the 12000 labs that are federally regulated either because they do 
work under medicare or medicaid or engage in interstate commerce 
the practial effect is to cover virtually all commercial labs 
except those in physicians offices however congress has ordered 
the health care financing administration or hcfa to regulate 
physicians office labs that test 5000 specimens or more starting 
jan 1 1990 
the 90day public comment period outlined in tuesdays notice 
also solicits comments on whether the uniform standards should 
apply to physicians office labs once they are covered by federal 
standards 
under current law labs must participate in an approved program 
of proficiency testing to receive medicare or medicaid funds the 
standards can vary from state to state and between groups that 
conduct the proficiency exams such as the college of american 
pathologists and the american association of bioanalysts 
at present there are no uniform or minimally acceptable 
federal standards for proficiency testing programs said hcfa 
administrator william l roper program criteria and grading 
standards vary widely our regulatory reform initiative will 
resolve these problems 
hcfa had previously disclosed its plans to propose the new 
standards which include 
a uniform national proficiency testing program developed by the 
centers for disease control with specific standards for such things 
as throat and urine cultures and glucose and cholesterol tests 
options for required proficiency testing for pap smears and 
tougher rescreening requirements for negative pap smears 
especially those performed for women in highrisk categories the 
proposal seeks comment on whether the final regulation also should 
get into workload criteria for individuals who screen pap smear 
slides 
revised rules to ensure that lab workers are qualified with 
additional requirements for lab directors 
a new requirement that individual labs establish their own 
quality assurance programs

the house voted 34654 tuesday to require a 
tenfold increase in the amount power companies must pay to victims 
of an accident at a nuclear generating plant 
despite the proposed jump however critics inside and outside 
congress blasted the plan as corporate bailout that would still 
leave taxpayers and victims footing most of the liability costs of 
a major nuclear accident 
the legislation expected to win senate approval is a 15year 
renewal of the priceanderson act the unique law that limits the 
amount the nuclear power industry would have to pay in damages to 
accident victims 
the law first enacted in 1957 expired a year ago it is the 
only federal statute setting a cap on how much an industry would 
have to pay to victims in this case 710 million 
the housepassed plan would set the industry liability limit at 
71 billion with 160 million covered by private insurance and 
the rest apportioned among the nations utilities owning nuclear 
plants 
if it appeared that damage awards would exceed the limit 
congress would have to come up with legislation to provide the 
additional money needed to compensate victims 
this leaves the government and the taxpayers holding the 
bag said rep dennis eckart dohio these corporate bailout 
amendments perpetuate the most egregious form of taxpayer 
support imaginable 
also attacking the legislation was public citizen the ralph 
naderfounded organization that said government studies have 
suggested that a catastrophic accident at a nuclear power plant 
could cause 100 billion or more in damages 
the priceanderson act is a multibilliondollar annual 
windfall for the nuclear industry which distorts the energy 
marketplace encourages unsafe nuclear facilities and dumps the 
risk of a major accident in the lap of federal taxpayers or the 
victims themselves the organizations ken bossong said in a 
prepared statement 
steve unglesbee director of legislation communications for the 
american nuclear energy council an industry group said in an 
interview that the legislation is a big step forward in 
compensation for victims 
unglesbee said he did not think that the laws renewal by itself 
would signal a revitalization of the nuclear power industry which 
has appeared almost moribund in recent years 
to do this the federal government must streamline the process 
for licensing new nuclear generators and settle on a standardized 
design for nuclear plants according to unglesbee 
barring an accident requiring industry payments to victims 
renewal of the compensationlimit law is not expected to affect 
homeowners electricity rates very much because liability insurance 
costs are a small part of a utilitys operating expenses

a senior iraqi envoy declared tuesday that 
his government will reject any attempt by the united nations to 
impose a ceasefire in the 8yearold war with iraq without 
previous consent from baghdad 
we will not accept a fait accompli no matter in what form or 
from which quarter it comes said riyadh alqaysi iraqs former 
un ambassador and now a member of the iraqi delegation to un 
peace talks 
qaysi repeated iraqs demand for facetoface talks with iran 
before any truce he said irans insistence on an immediate 
ceasefire and rejection of direct talks at this time shows what 
they are aiming at is simply a ceasefire which they so urgently 
need after their successive defeats 
he said we shall never give the iranians that chance to use 
a truce to regroup 
qaysi was reacting to reports that secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar might unilaterally declare a ceasefire in the 
war even if iraq rejects it that would increase pressure on iraq 
to agree to an early peace settlement and drop its demand for 
direct talks 
but perez de cuellar later told reporters i am prepared to 
continue discussions with all parties concerned and i think fait 
accompli is a little of imagination of those who use the word and 
dont know what it means 
he and un officials emphasized tuesday that the un chief did 
not intend to declare a ceasefire unilaterally although he has 
the power to do so 
they said he would consult first with the head of un 
ceasefire factfinding team gen martin vadset who arrives 
thursday from the region then the security council and possibly 
the foreign ministers of iraq and iran 
perez de cuellar held no official meetings tuesday with iranian 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati or iraqi foreign minister tariq 
aziz he has been seeing them since last week 
on monday night perez de cuellar told reporters listen dday 
the day a ceasefire begins does not depend on the parties 
asked if he might announce dday if iraq remains opposed the 
un chief said that is a decision which i have to take in any 
case in consultation with the members of the security council 
perez de cuellar told reporters on tuesday he may be in touch 
with the iraqi and iranian foreign ministers as well 
iran rejects direct talks with iraq before a ceasefire troop 
withdrawal and prisoner exchange 
iranian mission spokesman amir zamani told reporters tuesday 
that qaysis statement was a demagogic argument because it 
claims iran does not seek a lasting peace only a temporary truce 
an estimated million people have died in the iraniraq war that 
began in september 1980 
iran resisted for a year a un security council demand for a 
ceasefire but last july 18 the tehran government abruptly 
announced it would go along now it accuses iraq of procrastinating 
qaysi said that resolution 598 is not simply a ceasefire it 
is a peace plan and that has to be negotiated facetoface to test 
the real intentions of iran 
on tuesday francois giuliani spokesman for the 
secretarygeneral told reporters the un chief does not intend to 
act unilaterally theoretically he can do so practically he will 
consult 
iranian ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati reaffirmed tuesday 
that his government thinks the secretarygeneral is obliged to 
declare a dday to begin a ceasefire even if iraq is opposed 
mahallati said the security council should consider imposing an 
arms embargo against iraq if it does not accept a truce he also 
said the council should act swiftly to condemn iraq by name for 
repeated and largescale use of outlawed chemical weapons

president george vassiliou of cyprus pledged 
tuesday his country would not seek union with greece if turkish 
troops departed 
the concept of union with greece is not anymore considered a 
realistic objective vassiliou said at a news conference 
turkey invaded the island in 1974 ostensibly to protect the 
minority turkish cypriot population against the possibility that 
cyprus would unite with greece 
greek cypriots form about 70 percent of the countrys population 
vassiliou said most want cyprus to develop as an independent 
country with greek and turkish cypriots living in peace 
but he stressed the estimated 30000 turkish troops and 50000 
turkish settlers must leave they are concentrated in the north 
where there is a separate turkish cypriot state 
vassiliou who met on monday with president reagan has proposed 
the creation of a federalized republic and the demilitarization of 
cyprus 
he will hold talks in new york on aug 24 with rauf denktash 
leader of the turkish cypriot community under united nations 
auspices 
vassiliou said he hoped the meeting was the first step toward a

if the turkish troops and tanks depart he said cyprus will 
give up its right to have its own military forces and dismiss its 
army of 10000 
the several hundred million dollars saved would be diverted to 
economic development especially the turkish cypriot community 
which has fallen behind he said 
today the free part of cyprus has a healthy economy he 
said earlier in a speech our standard of living is high we are 
farming we are producing we are trading we are investing we are 
growing 
and i must emphasize that this near miraculous recovery of our 
country was achieved in the face of the turkish occupying forces 
but despite our success the real potential of cyprus cannot be 
realized because of the presence of this occupation force which 
prevents the turkish cypriot community from contributing and 
sharing in cyprus growth

members of the congressional black caucus and 
other lawmakers on tuesday called on japan to end advertising and 
marketing practices that are derogatory and offensive to blacks in 
the united states 
the lawmakers accused three japanese firms of producing products 
and mannequins which show blacks in a stereotypical and degrading 
light they are the sanrio co sogo department store and yamato 
mannequin co 
rep mervyn m dymally dcalif the caucus chairman suggested 
blacks might boycott japanese products if changes are not made he 
said the portrayal of blacks in marketing and advertising in japan 
is insensitive and racially inflammatory 
dymally made public a letter to japans prime minister noboru 
takeshita urging him to call a meeting with japanese businessmen 
to formally bring an end to the negative stereotypic 
representations of black americans once and for all 
as pressure mounts for national boycotts of japanese 
products dymally added it is imperative that your country 
sends a clear message that it understands and is sensitive to the 
political environments in which it does business 
kenichiro ide a spokesman for sanrio told the washington post 
last month that the firms line of toys which portray little black 
sambo with large white eyes and a round black face was not meant 
to offend blacks 
he said they should be seen in a humorous and friendly light 
adding nobody in japan regards this as racist 
sogo department stores and yamato mannequin co also have said 
they had no racist intentions 
masaaki honjo spokesman for sogo told the post the store had 
no intentions of discriminating kauhiro nakajima an official with 
yasmato said the black mannequins show strong personality 
energy and charm he also said that it was the companys 
conclusion that the exaggerated racial features on the mannequins 
were not racist depictions of blacks 
however members of the caucus as well as reps julian c dixon 
dcalif and robert t matsui dcalif disagreed 
when officials repeatedly apologize for offensive racial slurs 
by calling them humorous and seeing no harm done it is not a 
faux pas an aberration a gaffe or a slip of the tongue it is a 
dangerous mind set matsui said 
dixon said japan is not an isolated colony that could hide 
behind the defense of ignorance it is a worldwide economic giant 
a leader in overseas investment in an era of global travel 
it has the new responsibility to act like a world leader 
dymally and other caucus members also complained about japans 
becoming south africas no 1 trading partner at a time when the 
united states is encouraging other nations to join its partial 
trade boycott against that countrys white minority government

the nation is beginning to see increasing 
inflationary pressures with prices rising for a wide range of 
products from metals and paper to food the federal reserve board 
said in a review of the economy tuesday 
the outlook based on reports from all 12 regional federal 
reserve banks found that bottlenecks were beginning to develop in 
some sectors of the economy us industry is now operating at 831 
percent of capacity the highest level in eight years 
capacity constraints and shortages have developed in some 
federal reserve districts and materials price increases are 
widespread the summary of the report concluded 
the report known internally as the tan book will be used 
as a starting point for discussions when fed policymakers gather in 
two weeks to map monetary strategy 
the central bank has instituted a series of small 
credittightening moves this year in an effort to dampen growing 
inflationary pressures those efforts have pushed a variety of 
interest rates including mortgage rates higher with many 
analysts forecasting further tightening in the months ahead as 
price increases continue unabated 
price increases for metals paper and food were widely noted in 
the reports from the various fed districts several districts 
reported shortages for such manufactured products as steel valves 
motors and chemicals 
in this environment manufacturers are reportedly choosing to 
hold higher inventories and are finding it easier to raise their 
own finished goods prices the report said 
it said tight labor markets were being reported in some areas as 
the current economic recovery now almost six years old continued 
at moderate to strong levels in most areas 
on other economic issues the report found 
the impact of the drought varies considerably even within a 
state corn and wheat crops have suffered extensive damage but 
recent rains may be enough to save much of the soybean crop 
retail sales have been generally lackluster with only the 
atlanta and minneapolis regions reporting any real strength sales 
of clothing and furniture have been particularly weak although 
demand for autos has rebounded 
residential construction is below levels of a year ago but 
nonresidential construction showed signs of higher activity in 
some regions of the country

blocking the central american peace process again 
shultz and the foreign ministers of costa rica guatemala el 
salvador and honduras met in guatemala city and issued a 
declaration calling for peace democracy security social

honduras was angered by the soft stand taken by costa rica and 
guatemala president jose azcona hoyo sent a sharp message to

form alliances with represive and totalitarian governments 
a honduran intelligence report obtained by the associated from 
honduran military sources describing nicaragua as a military 
threat to the entire region

the sandinistas the report said it predicted the sandinistas 
would not enact democratic reforms and would grow even closer to 
the soviet union 
barricada the official paper of the sandinista national 
liberation front said shultz tried to pressure the four central 
american nations into signing a virtual declaration of war

the central american governments to sell out the promises of 
esquipulas ii everyone in the region expects new pressures and 
blackmail when he returns from south america barricada said 
esquipulas ii is the name given the regional peace plan 
in line with the plan the sandinistas and nicaraguan rebels 
known as contras reached a ceasefire agreement in march the 
peace talks have been stalled since june however and the

presidentelect rodrigo borja 
ortegas office said tuesday he had decided to attend borjas 
inauguration ecuador broke diplomatic relations with nicaragua in

some 2000 registered nurses demanding 
higher pay went on strike tuesday at six major hospitals joining 
nearly 1700 service employees who walked off the job last week 
were really behind other rns in the area and in view of the 
nursing shortage that becomes a patientcare issue said paula 
fillari a nurse at saint francis memorial hospital in san 
francisco 
but the five hospitals in san francisco and one in neighboring 
daly city said they would continue to provide good care despite the 
first widespread strike here by nurses in 14 years 
the hospitals said they were flying in temporary nurses 
transferring some patients and planned to restrict surgery to 
emergencies and defer admissions 
we have a labor pool in place to continue providing quality 
patient care said terry hastings a spokeswoman for childrens 
hospital in san francisco 
the strike by members of the california nurses association 
followed a breakdown in talks with a federal mediator shortly 
before midnight monday the union rejected a revised offer by the 
employers and picket lines went up at 7 am when overnight shifts 
ended 
nurses many in white uniforms walked in quiet orderly lines 
outside hospital entrances carrying signs reading thou shalt 
not commit scabbery love thy nurses as thyself why is there a 
nursing shortage and really needed little noticed 
none of us like being out here theres a lot of personal 
agony doing this fillari said 
other affected hospitals were childrens marshal hale mount 
zion and st marys in san francisco and seton medical center in 
daly city the six negotiated jointly as affiliated hospitals of 
san francisco 
the same hospitals along with pacific presbyterian hospital in 
san francisco were struck july 26 by 1700 licensed vocational 
nurses and service workers in a dispute over sick leave and health 
benefits registered nurses at pacific presbyterian also part of 
affiliated hospitals do not belong to the california nurses 
association 
pay has been the chief issue in the dispute 
the nurses group originally asked for 15 percent raises for each 
year of a twoyear contract but later changed its proposal to 11 
percent the first year and 10 percent the next nurses also sought 
higher pay for working on weekends and regular pay raises for 
veteran nurses 
on monday night affiliated hospitals made a new proposal that a 
spokeswoman said would bring nurses parity with those working at 
kaiser foundation hospitals in the san francisco bay area 
the hospitals previous offer included 5 percent increases for 
each year of a threeyear contract 
monday nights proposal called for a 7 percent increase the 
first year with an extra 2 percent for nurses with 10 years or more 
of service a 5 percent increase effective jan 1 1989 and 
another 6 percent the following year affiliated hospitals 
spokeswoman janis mackenzie said nurses with 15 years or more 
tenure would get another 2 percent in the final year 
the nurses association however called the offer unacceptable 
and declined to present it to its members 
registered nurses at affiliated hospitals earn from about 
31000 to about 36000 for day shifts and up to 43000 a year 
for night shifts

officials unleashed millions of sterile pink 
mediterranean fruit flies over a 16squaremile area tuesday in an 
effort to breed the agricultural scourge to extinction 
the release of 4 million sterile flies including the afternoon 
release by an airplane strafing the san fernando valley is the 
second phase of a twopronged battle to get rid of the voracious 
cropdestroying pest 
last week agriculture officials bombarded the area with the 
pesticide malathion any survivors of that attack should be so 
outnumbered by the swarms of sterile flies that they will mate only 
with sterile flies said robert donley deputy director of the 
county agriculture commission 
they breed themselves out of existence explained donley 
cardboard buckets laden with sterile medflies were carried by 
truck throughout the area and released starting at 10 am 
officials will release about 20 million flies over four days 
this week and continue the procedure each week for about two months 
to cover two potential generations of medflies which have a 
lifespan of about a month donley said inspectors continued to 
monitor traps scattered in trees throughout the area sterile flies 
attracted by the baited traps can be distinguished by their 
fluorescent pink dye 
the color isnt visible to the naked eye donley said 
when collected in traps they are looked at under black lights to 
see if they are sterile ones 
the medfly threatens the states 14 billionayear agricultural 
industry because it lays eggs in more than 250 varieties of fruits 
and vegetables the flies usually enter the state on fruit brought 
back from hawaii by tourists 
six flies had been found recently in the san fernando valley a 
100squaremile area that includes a number of bedroom suburbs 
northwest of los angeles donley said no new flies were found 
monday or tuesday he said 
the use of sterile flies helped eradicate a medfly infestation 
last summer in eastern los angeles county 
the cobalttreated sterile flies are raised in hawaii at a 
laboratory established after californias 1981 medfly infestation

firefighters battling western wilderness blazes got a break 
tuesday from the weather in montana but lost out in wyoming as 
rain forecast for yellowstone national park never fell 
in idaho crews turned their attention to other fires after a 
5000acre fire sparked by a cigarette was contained the eightday 
blaze 35 miles northeast of boise destroyed 75 million in timber 
and other resources while costing 15 million to fight 
firefighters in both montana and idaho were aided by cooler 
temperatures and higher humidity and wind in montana was the 
lightest in days thanks to a cool front from canada 
at yellowstone rain was a failed hope for firefighters trying 
to keep a 17700acre fire about eight miles west of old faithful 
from moving toward the fabled geyser 
its all gone to canada on us we had rain forecast for us 
but it all moved north of us said fire information officer earl 
laorange 
three air tankers and two helicopters toting 700gallon water 
buckets were called in as air support for crews tackling the north 
fork fire one of several blazes involving more than 145500 acres 
of park land 
hundreds of firefighters were assigned to block the fires path 
toward old faithful although if they failed officials did not 
think the geyser complex would be immediately threatened said lee 
poague another fire information officer 
the amount of fuel between the fire and old faithful theres 
not nearly as much fuel there to carry the fire he said 
still fire managers were bracing for the worst as gusting winds 
fanned the flames tuesday 
elsewhere in the park crews tackled the shoshone fire which 
had spread to 19100 acres monday although about 6000 acres 
within the fire lines had not yet been burned according to poague 
the adjoining lewis lake or red fire involved 17700 acres of 
which some 5000 were still green he said 
in idaho firefighters faced an uphill fight against the 
1000acre spring canyon ii fire eight miles east of swan valley 
near the wyoming border 
the crews had to be pulled off the line yesterday because it 
was really dangerous targhee national forest spokeswoman lisa 
lew said theyre expecting strong winds again 
in the boise national forest near cascade firefighters pushed 
toward full containment of the 200acre riordan lake fire aided by 
cooler temperatures and higher humidity 
fire managers in montana predicted that the 3200acre rock 
creek fire near darby would be contained by wednesday morning the 
fire was held in check tuesday by 871 firefighters and the canadian 
cool front that pushed temperatures to shivering levels overnight 
and produced a cool still autumnlike day

burmas new leadership continuing its 
campaign to stamp out dissent arrested two aging war heroes who 
allegedly plotted to overthrow the weekold government western 
diplomats in burma said tuesday 
reports of the latest arrests came amid rumors that sein lwin 
the countrys leader was the target of an assassination attempt 
friday by a personal assistant who wounded him slightly in the arm 
and then killed himself 
the rumors are widespread enough to be taken seriously but we 
cannot confirm them said a western diplomat reached in rangoon 
the burmese capital he spoke on condition of anonymity 
the londonbased human rights group amnesty international 
meanwhile expressed concern over the arrests last week of aung 
gyi the countrys most vocal dissident and as many as 24 of his 
friends and political associates 
western diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said ta 
ya and yan nyang were arrested monday in connection with 
underground pamphlets calling for the overthrow of sein lwin 
the two were members of thirty comrades a group of young 
men who in december 1941 mixed blood from their arms in a silver 
bowl and vowed to liberate burma from british colonialism 
the men at first fought with the japanese then switched 
allegiance to the allies battling japans forces in their homeland 
their leader aung san negotiated the end of colonial rule and 
would have become one of the countrys first leaders had he not 
been assassinated in 1947 
on monday the government announced it arrested aung gyi and his 
associates for allegedly attacking the state 
a list of the detainees released by the official news agency 
burma included a number of retired military officers who had fallen 
out with former leader ne win in the 1960s as well as associated 
press correspondent sein win 
initial reports on the government announcement did not mention 
sein win as one of those listed 
louis d boccardi president and general manager of the ap said 
in a letter to sein lwin dated tuesday that the associated press 
is deeply concerned over sein wins arrest and detention and 
would appreciate further information and a clarification of the 
charges against him 
boccardi asked that an ap representative be allowed to visit 
sein win and expressed hope the family already had that privilege 
boccardi said a reported charge of attacking the state 
against the correspondent does not comport with our long 
knowledge of sein win 
he said that until his arrest sein win was in daily contact 
with officials and media there in his attempt to report 
impartially honestly and accurately on the situation in your 
country 
in his conversations with other ap correspondents and 
executives he has made clear his determination to portray burma 
impartially and fairly to the world boccardi noted adding that 
sein win at times objected when he felt a news report did not 
justly describe the situation as he knew it 
the us state department and other sources say as many as 25 
people may have been arrested in the sweep last week rangoon has 
only mentioned 10 
in statements released monday and tuesday amnesty international 
said the detainees may be prisoners of conscience held for their 
nonviolent political beliefs 
at last report they were held incommunicado without charge or 
trial in insein central prison near rangoon the statements 
said adding they had not been brought before a court and had been 
refused visits by lawyers or family members 
the group quoted journalists as saying that sein wins recent 
reporting on burma was independent and objective and 
speculating that the reporting contributed to his arrest 
the londonbased international press institute a media watchdog 
group protested the ap reporters detention in a letter to burmese 
leader sein lwin according to peter galliner director of the 
institute 
rangoon radio said the new leader had met with members of the 
central organs of power monday and urged them to abide by the 
law respect human rights and review the countrys rundown economy 
to implement needed reforms 
this new government is trying to effect some economic reform 
but its quite clear that the hopes of political reform have been 
pretty well bashed said one western diplomat in bangkok 
diplomats in rangoon said students and some buddhist monks have 
been staging peaceful protests daily at shwedagon pagoda burmas 
holiest shrine and a traditional center for protest 
pamphlets also have been circulating in the burmese capital 
calling for a nationwide general strike aug 8 
western diplomats have described sein lwin who took power when 
ne win resigned last month after 26 years of authoritarian rule as 
widely unpopular in burma he is blamed for ruthless suppression of 
student riots in rangoon last march in which more than 100 people 
are said to have died 
the unanswered question is whether the students and public can 
translate distaste for sein lwin into action and what response the 
army will have one diplomat said

he pulled the circuit breakers which is standard procedure and 
the smoke went away

at the plane spitler said plymate put the two main gears onto the 
runway then held the nose gear off as long as possible 
spitler praised the crew saying it was a delicate situation 
but the pilot put it down very gently and smoothly and he made it a 
happy ending they did a fine job in a difficult situation 
bowman said indianapolisbased allegheny commuter is a feeder 
airline for usair it has 47 departures daily to various cities in 
the midwest 
bowman said he did not know what caused the malfunctioning gear 
motor and did not have a damage estimate for the aircraft

the irancontra prosecutor on tuesday 
suggested postponing oliver l norths trial on major conspiracy 
counts while he attempts to solve the problem of disclosing 
classified documents in court 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh conceding the problems 
of public disclosure are formidable and the outlook discouraging 
urged the judge to consider trying north on 13 other charges before 
taking up the three counts stemming from the diversion of iranian 
armssale profits to the nicaraguan rebels 
us district judge gerhard a gesell indicated in an order 
issued later in the day that he would go along with walshs 
suggestion the order which et procedures for next mondays closed 
hearing on classified documents said the proceeding would focus 
only on the 13 other charges that walsh contends are ready for 
trial 
in his pleading walsh said gesell could still hold a trial 
now set for sept 20 on all 16 counts against the former white 
house aide if he relaxes a july 8 order that the cia and other 
intelligence agencies turn over highly classified documents for 
norths defense 
gesell has ruled that north needs the material to try to show he 
acted with the understanding his activities were approved by higher 
authorities in the reagan administration 
under the proposed procedure the intelligence agencies can 
continue the process of collecting and analyzing their documents to 
assure completion of any additional discovery ordered by the 
court walsh said 
meantime north could be tried on charges that he made false 
statements to congress obstructed justice by shredding documents 
illegally accepted installation of a 13800 security fence outside 
his home and pocketed 4300 worth of travelers checks from the 
contras 
the former national security council aide is also charged with 
taxfraud conspiracy involving private fundraising for the 
nicaraguan rebels 
walsh said these charges do not involve nearly as many 
classified documents moreover he said the criminal conduct 
alleged in these counts is discrete and the allegations far from 
involving novel legal theories are routine 
that statement amounted to a concession of the legal 
difficulties posed by the conspiracy charge against north and three 
codefendants former national security adviser john m poindexter 
and arms dealers albert hakim and richard v secord 
the four who are scheduled to be tried separately all are 
charged with conspiring to defraud the government theft of 
government property and wire fraud in connection with the diversion 
of armssale proceeds to the contras 
gesell has threatened to dismiss those charges if the government 
does not produce the documents north says he needs to show that the 
irancontra operation was no different than other covert operations 
authorized by president reagan 
in a july 25 letter to walsh the cia said it was willing to let 
north and his lawyers inspect most of the documents but the agency 
said that details or the very existence of many covert 
activities identified in norths topsecret request cannot be 
disclosed in court without jeopardizing national security 
the cia said it would take several months to collect many of the 
documents sought by north 
in a filing last week prosecutor walsh said much of the 
material can never be disclosed publicly 
but in tuesdays pleading he said the charges should not be 
dismissed before he is given an opportunity to show that north does 
not need the documents for his defense 
walsh said he could show no authorized covert actions 
identified in norths supplemental discovery request were 
sufficiently similar to the conduct charged in the indictment to 
lead north to believe that that conduct would be proper 
walsh said he knew of no analogue for the diversion of 
armssale funds charged in the indictment 
north meanwhile has asked gesell to postpone the trial until 
next year to give his lawyers more time to study the thousands of 
pages of documents already turned over by walsh the defense also 
contends that north would be unable get a fair trial during the 
presidential campaign this fall 
at last weeks hearing gesell said he was not wedded to the 
sept 20 trial date adding we cannot go forward until we 
understand what we are going to try 
north faces the most charges in the 23count indictment returned 
march 16 
poindexter is additionally charged with obstructing 
congressional investigations into covert aid to the contras hakim 
and secord are accused of conspiring to offer an illegal gratuity 
to north by setting up a 200000 swissbank account for his 
childrens education 
secord is also charged with paying an illegal gratuity by 
financing the installation of norths security fence

four of the six opposition parties in 
the national assembly said tuesday they will boycott debate on a 
new election law because the proposal is arbitrary 
antidemocratic and antipluralistic 
a boycott by the communist socialist liberal independent and 
popular social christian parties could not block the measure the 
four hold a total of 19 seats in the 96member legislalture and the 
governing sandinistas have 61 
the two other opposition parties the conservative democrats and 
the marxistleninist popular action movement hold 16 seats and are 
expected to participate in the debate 
luis sanchez sancho secretarygeneral of the socialist party 
said the proposed election law would virtually exclude opposition 
parties 
he noted the law would require a party to obtain the signatures 
of 10 percent of the nations registered voters to be considered 
legal 
sanchez sancho also said the proposed legislation negates 
sandinista promises of democratic reforms and defies provisions of 
a regional peace accord that president daniel ortega and the 
presidents of four other central american countries signed on aug 
7 1987 
ortega submitted the 195article electionlaw draft on july 2 
bypassing reform negotiations with the nicaraguan rebels known as 
contras at that time assembly president carlos nunez promised 
intense and controversial debate 
national elections are scheduled for november 1990 and the new 
law will replace regulations adopted by the supreme electoral 
council in november 1984 when ortega won a sixyear term most of 
the opposition boycotted the 1984 balloting 
the sandinista national liberation front has controlled the 
government since leading the revolutionary war that ended 42 years 
of rule by the rightist somoza family in july 1979

republican george bush hailing what president reagan and i 
have accomplished said tuesday a new era in foreign relations 
demands experienced leaders rather than onthejob training at 
the white house reagan meanwhile helped bush on a major issue 
dogging his campaign 
in washington the president said he had decided against his 
better judgment to allow a plantclosing notification bill to 
become law he said he wanted to end democratic political 
shenanigans 
bush in a foreign policy speech in chicago said i think the 
president made a good decision and that matter is now resolved and 
now we can get the focus where it belongs on plant openings 
a bush spokesman suggested reagans action would prevent further 
efforts by presidential rival michael dukakis and other democrats 
to use the issue against bush 
but dukakis rejected the idea that he no longer had the issue in 
his battle with bush 
i dont think we lost an issue said dukakis who spent the 
day at the massachusetts statehouse i think we won a great 
victory 
and leslie dach dukakis spokesman told reporters after the 
governors news conference the vice president opposed the bill 
the president still said it was a terrible bill certainly its 
going to be an issue right through november 
dukakis credited congress and in particular running mate sen 
lloyd bentsen of texas with forcing reagan to make the decision 
dukakis said the progress of the plantclosing bill and other 
legislation all sponsored by democrats had a great deal to do 
with the attitude of the american people that they want something 
different 
bentsen told reporters at a news conference i certainly think 
that plant closing is going to remain a very strong issue and it 
shows the difference that we are for fairness in this 
bentsen said of reagan i think he saw the polls and i think 
he also saw what was going to happen in the senate 
reagan said that democrats in congress had exploited public 
sentiment on the issue the president had vetoed an earlier trade 
bill citing the inclusion of a provision that requires a 60day 
advance notice of plant closings and layoffs involving companies 
with 50 or more employees 
the veto was upheld but both the house and senate subsequently 
passed a separate plantclosing bill by seemingly vetoproof 
margins 
the democrats have used the issue to suggest the reagan 
administration lacks compassion for bluecollar workers 
craig fuller bushs chief of staff said reagans decision 
would put a damper on democratic plans for the political game to 
be played over the plantclosing issue 
dukakis has argued strongly in favor of requiring notification 
raising the issue in his speech to the democratic national 
convention in atlanta 
dayton duncan a dukakis aide said reagans decision is a 
testament to the people around the nation who supported this 
bill asked if the decision takes an issue away from dukakis he 
said not at all the point is that ronald reagan and george bush 
tried to stop it where is george on this he used to oppose it 
house majority whip tony coelho dcalif said after reagans 
announcement even though ronald reagan still occupies the white 
house we can safely say michael dukakis has just signed into law 
his first bill as president 
in his speech bush took a sharp jab at his opponents ability 
to succeed in the white house based on experience as governor of 
massachusetts 
it is not a time for timidity hesitancy and onthejob 
training bush told the midamerica committee this new era 
demands from america and its elected officials firm consistent 
and experienced leadership 
bush said president reagan and i have worked successfully 
to restore american leadership since taking office and have 
repaired our nations defenses modernized our strategic nuclear 
forces deployed intermediate nuclear forces in europe and restored 
pride in our nations military services 
the vice president outlining his foreign policy plans said he 
would deploy a spacebased missile defense system as soon as 
feasible provide support to freedom fighters around the world 
and continue arms control negotiations with the soviet union but 
warily 
on the issue of freedom fighters bentsen on tuesday called for 
a new aid package for the nicaraguan contra rebels that includes 
standby military supplies unlike dukakis who strongly opposes 
contra aid bentsen has consistently voted for assistance to the 
rebel forces fighting the sandinista government 
as democrats met behind closed doors to work on the aid package 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan a former republican 
presidential candidate and possible bush running mate sought to 
highlight the differences on the issue between bentsen and dukakis 
it is a political issue dole told reporters there is a 
schism between the two candidates senator bentsen was right 
governor dukakis is wrong 
in his speech bush said the soviet union should be judged by 
what it delivers in arms reductions human rights immigration 
and lessening of tensions around the globe 
he spoke forcefully in favor of reagans strategic defense 
initiative also known as star wars which dukakis has 
criticized 
in a comment that seemed to open up a new argument for the 
system as well as challenge dukakis bush said it is one thing 
to say you are committed to israels security but in an age of 
ballistic missiles if you are against defensive systems such as 
sdi that slogan has little meaning 
in boston christopher edley jr national issues director for 
the dukakis campaign questioned bushs logic saying the point 
makes no sense whatsoever 
israels security is no more an important argument for sdi 
than water quality or auto safety is an argument for sdi edley 
said 
the vice president later returned to washington where he told a 
rally of ethnic leaders supporting his candidacy that he will win 
because i can speak our language of ethnic values and pride 
everlasting pride in the united states of america 
we are the only hope for freedom and democracy in the world 
bush told about 200 members of the bush88 coalition of american 
nationalities ill never apologize for the united states of 
america ever i dont care what the facts are 
some may wonderwhats a nice wasp like you doing in the 
company of such ethnic americans as sen alfonse damato rny 
edward j derwinski a top state department official and former 
chicago congressman and joseph evara president of the sons of 
italy bush said 
well its values thats why im a member he said 
earlier bushs aide fuller said the list of possible running 
mates had been narrowed somewhat in recent days but he gave no 
further information on that issue

with congress poised to approve reparations to 
japaneseamericans interned during world war ii the countrys 
largest japaneseamerican organization will consider apologizing to 
members of its own community for labeling them as disloyal more 
than 40 years ago 
among the roughly 120000 us citizens and resident aliens of 
japanese descent who were put in internment camps during the war 
several hundred young men were labeled nono boys for refusing 
to sign a us loyalty oath forswear allegiance to japan or be 
drafted into the military 
the nono boys were considered disloyal and some were beaten by 
fellow japaneseamericans dozens ended up in prison for refusing 
to cooperate 
now the japanese american citizens league which had urged 
japaneseamericans to enlist in the us military during the war 
will consider issuing an apology to the nono boys at its 30th 
annual convention at the university of washington this week 
ben nakagawa who is proposing a resolution to issue an apology 
was an elementary school student when his family was shipped to the 
tule lake camp in california during the war he said an apology 
would heal wounds within the japaneseamerican community at a time 
when many internment camp survivors are in their last years 
the nono boys if theyre alive now theyre in their 70s 
he said i want to have them die in peace with themselves and 
with their nikkei japaneseamerican community 
at least within our chapter theres a feeling people like the 
nono boys they too were real heroes and victims who have 
never been redressed said roger shimizu president of the 
leagues seattle chapter 
theres never been any recognition of them and among other 
japaneseamericans who served in the military these nono boys 
really were traitors he said 
the league meets in a week when the congress is expected to give 
final approval to pay taxfree reparations of 20000 to 
japaneseamericans who were interned 
jim akutsu was a nono boy akutsu said he revolted because he 
had tried unsuccessfully to enlist before the government labeled 
him an alien and shipped him to an internment camp 
citizenship is a contract between the people of the country 
and the government you protect me during peacetime and i will 
protect you during war said akutsu 68 a retired seattle city 
employee 
someplace along the line somebody breached the line and took 
away my citizenship all of a sudden i was 4c an enemy alien 
thats why i challenged it am i a citizen am i an alien if i was 
an alien i had no obligation to serve 
but akutsu said he isnt bitter about the treatment he received 
even though he spent about three years in mcneil island 
penitentiary with 44 other nono boys from the minedoka internment 
camp and he said he doesnt need an apology from the league 
i dont belong to the league he said whatever they did 
its their thing whatever i did is my thing

opposition leaders accused the military 
government tuesday of using scare tactics and creating a climate 
of violence in its campaign to win the october presidential 
referendum 
genaro arriagada executive secretary of a 16party opposition 
coalition said rightwing supporters of president augusto pinochet 
attacked its campaign offices late last month gen pinochet is 
expected to be the single candidate in the yes or no referendum 
arriagada also told a news conference the interior ministry gave 
its full support to the filming of simulated antigovernment 
street violence sunday near the presidential palace 
actors with faces masked by kerchiefs in the style of leftist 
extremists overturned a small truck and built barricades of 
burning tires the film crew would not talk with reporters and 
police barred journalists from the area 
a climate of violence is being promoted by the interior 
ministry arriagada said the filming of these spots is a 
violation of law an apology of violence 
he said he believed the footage would be used in progovernment 
television advertisements 
newspapers began publishing paid advertisements monday with the 
headline it happened just 15 years ago about violence in the 
final weeks of president salvador allendes government pinochet 
led a coup in september 1973 that ousted allende an elected 
marxist who died during the military takeover 
gutenberg martinez secretarygeneral of the centrist christian 
democratic party claimed the ads were part of a government 
campaign of terror and paid for with public funds 
carlos cabello leader of a propinochet organization said the 
charges were absurd 
we are only reminding the public that these same men who 
now are pretending to lead us to democracy and freedom are the same 
ones who 15 years ago destroyed the fatherlands roots trying to 
subject chileans to a tyranical totalitarian dictatorship he 
said in an interview with the government news agency orbe 
the government candidate will be chosen aug 30 by the 
commanders of the armed forces and national police and his name 
will be the only one on the ballot pinochet is the army commander 
if a majority approves the candidate he will serve an 
eightyear term starting in march if he is rejected open 
elections are to be held in 1990

chief justice william h rehnquist joined 
other legal experts tuesday in applauding the growing use of 
arbitration and other alternatives to litigation saying they offer 
a new path for justice 
rehnquist told a conference of state chief justices and court 
administrators that the use of nontraditional mechanisms to 
resolve disputes could turn out to be the wave of the future 
unless something is done to bring under control the cost of 
litigation in our courts what we now call alternative dispute 
resolution may become the mainstream for many kinds of cases the 
chief justice said 
rehnquists remarks set the stage for a series of presentations 
and panel discussions on innovative procedures established by the 
various states to encourage mediation and arbitration to resolve 
civil disputes without lengthy court battles 
up to 90 percent of all civil cases are settled before trial 
said carl f bianchi administrative director of idaho state 
courts but what is new is the enthusiastic packaging and 
selling of outofcourt options for settling disputes 
bianchi said there are currently more than 800 such programs 
around the country ranging from ambitious statefinanced systems 
to a canine court in los angeles in which a trained animal handler 
attempts to mediate disputes between dog owners and plaintiffs 
rehnquist said that while the federal courts are trying some 
alternative dispute procedures most of the action is in state 
courts because they have the bulk of the caseload 
they have to be the pioneers in this he said of state 
courts adding that they can serve as laboratories in which legal 
scholars can examine which methods work and which do not 
the chief justice characterized as a bum rap the suggestion 
that alternative options are tantamount to a secondclass system 
of justice 
noting that a firstclass lawsuit can remain tied up in the 
courts for five years and conclude with a lawyer receiving more 
than half the amount recovered rehnquist said it should come as no 
surprise that many wouldbe litigants would prefer a different 
approach 
if alternative dispute resolution can provide a fair system of 
resolving a claim and do it in a reasonable amount of time and at 
reasonable expense it can be the wave of the future he said 
rehnquist also announced that he has appointed a committee of 
the judicial conference of the united states chaired by retired 
justice lewis powell to look into the review process in capital 
punishment cases 
the committee will try to determine whether the combined review 
process of capital sentences in state and federal courts takes too 
much time and whether theres coherence and rationality in the 
process rehnquist said

vice president george bush and the senates 
top republican urged president reagan on tuesday to veto the 
pentagon budget bill but a leading senate democrat said such a step 
would be a serious mistake and national security should not take 
a back seat to electionyear politics 
reagan has until friday to act and the president has not made 
a final decision said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
well have to wait and see 
the bill authorizes 2995 billion in defense spending for the 
fiscal year starting oct 1 which is the amount reagan asked but 
it sharply reduced spending for the star wars antimissile program 
and includes some democraticbacked arms control restrictions 
reagan opposes 
bush the certain republican presidential nominee said in a 
speech in chicago he hopes reagan rejects the bill he said it is 
a bad bill and im convinced that the president ought to veto 
it 
senate republican leader bob dole rkan met with reagan 
earlier tuesday and said the president was undecided but doles 
advice was clear in my view he should veto it 
later dole called the bill a dukakis package that ought to be 
vetoed he said at a news conference that the bill contains a 
number of defense positions advocated by democratic presidential 
nominee michael dukakis 
but sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services 
committee said a presidential veto would be a serious mistake 
and that the bill will definitely strengthen our national 
security 
politics should not guide nor be the basis for national 
security decisions said nunn the security of the nation is 
too important to have it take a back seat to electionyear 
politics said nunn 
the measure is a good bill one that will definitely 
strengthen our national security he said 
rep les aspin chairman of the house armed services committee 
said republicans want to use the bill to argue that democrats are 
weak on defense but he predicted the strategy would backfire 
because democrats would unite against such charges 
the wisconsin democrat said the bill does less violence to the 
presidents programs than previous bills that were not vetoed 
why didnt the white house veto those bills aspin asked 
because george bush wasnt running for prersident thats why 
defense secretary frank c carlucci and other senior advisers to 
reagan are urging him to sign the measure according to 
congressional sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the bill was passed july 14 by both the house and senate the 
margin was 229183 in the house and 6430 in the senate as both 
democraticled chambers generally split along party lines neither 
margin would be large enough to overturn a reagan veto 
for the strategic defense initiative as star wars is formally 
known the bill authorizes 4 billion slightly more than the 
current sdi budget of 39 billion but far less than the 48 
billion reagan wanted 
the bill also deeply reduced spending for the spacebased 
interceptor which is being developed as the first phase of an 
eventual sdi program the pentagon wanted 330 million for the 
program but the bill restricts the total to 85 million 
the measure also requires the retirement of three aging 
missilefiring poseidon submarines as new subs are built that 
continues the policy of generally keeping the united states near 
weapons limits imposed by the unratified salt ii nuclear treaty a 
policy reagan opposes 
the bill also directs the energy department to prepare for a 
comprehensive treaty banning nuclear tests a longtime goal of arms 
control supporters 
the measure bans flight testing of depressed trajectory 
missiles as long as the soviets refrain from testing their 
versions of those weapons a ban opposed by the administration 
fitzwater said reagan believes the star wars cuts are too deep 
and the measure restructures many of the spending priorities in 
the defense department and ties our hands in many cases 
related to arms control negotiations

a lutheran minister and a freelance 
journalist were acquitted tuesday of violating federal law by 
bringing into the united states two pregnant salvadoran women 
described by the defense as refugees 
a jury deliberated 4 hours over two days before acquitting the 
rev glen remerthamert and demetria martinez of all charges 
the defense billed the case as the first court test in new 
mexico for the sanctuary movement which since 1980 has sought to 
aid refugees from wartorn areas of central america 
remerthamerts attorneys portrayed him as a religious man who 
believed he could legally help two refugees under thengov toney 
anayas march 1986 proclamation declaring new mexico a sanctuary 
state 
it all came down to intent i think this would have been a 
different case without the sanctuary proclamation juror 
antoinette tellez 23 said after the verdict 
juror yvette carrillo also said the jury was swayed by the 
sanctuary proclamation arguments in the case of remerthamert she 
added that jurors agreed from the start of deliberations that ms 
martinez was along solely as a reporter on the august 1986 trip to 
bring the women to albuquerque 
ms martinezs attorney tova indritz had contended her client 
was protected by the first amendment guarantee of freedom of the 
press 
remerthamert 44 was charged with one count of conspiracy and 
two counts each of transporting harboring and inducing the women 
to enter the united states ms martinez 28 was charged with one 
count of conspiracy to violate immigration laws and two counts each 
of transporting and inducing the women 
prosecutors alleged remerthamert schemed with a salvadoran 
attorney to bring the women to the united states to give their 
babies up for adoption and then return the mothers to el salvador 
they contended ms martinez helped remerthamert get the women 
into the united states from ciudad juarez mexico prosecutors said 
the defendants knew they were acting illegally because 
remerthamert paid a juarez family to get the women from mexico 
into the united states and the group took back roads on the way to 
albuquerque to avoid us border patrol checkpoints 
the women ines camposanzora and cecelia eliasalegria were 
the chief prosecution witnesses in the twoweek trial 
the prosecution contended the women were not refugees because 
they came to the united states to give up their babies for adoption 
and perhaps to get jobs and because they intended to return to el 
salvador ms campos testified she was not afraid in her native 
country 
defense attorney alice hector countered that most refugees 
intend to return to their native land sometime 
remerthamert said he hopes immigration authorities grant the 
women refugee status and allow them to stay in the the country 
the babies already are us citizens because they were born in 
new mexico ms compos kept her baby while ms elias baby was 
given up for adoption 
the women remain in the united states on temporary permits from 
the us immigration and naturalization service 
the courtroom was packed with family friends and supporters of 
the defendants who gasped as the court clerk read the verdicts on 
each of the counts against remerthamert the minister stood with 
his attorneys hugging one of them 
when it was ms martinezs turn to hear the verdicts on the 
charges against her she and her attorney stood with their hands on 
each others shoulders after the acquittal they both sat down and 
wiped tears from their eyes 
us attorney william lutz said after the verdicts we felt 
there was good evidence the salvadoran women entered illegally 
and were transported illegally 
but the question was one of intent and the jury disagreed with 
our position on what the intent was lutz said 
lutz who contended all along the case was not one of sanctuary 
or freedom of the press said the decision would have no effect on 
his offices prosecution of future alien cases 
each case involves its own set of facts he said 
ms martinez who writes for the albuquerque journal and the 
national catholic reporter said she hoped the victory will 
encourage other reporters to get out and find out what the 
government has to hide in its role in the situation in el 
salvador

the ira staged a bomb attack 
land mining and killing of a parttime trooper tuesday and warned 
civilians to avoid british soldiers a policeman also was killed 
and 25 people were wounded 
the attacks came a day after an explosion killed a soldier and 
wounded nine at an army postal sorting center in mill hill a 
london suburb 
the iras close concentration on security targets followed a 
series of botched and mistaken ira operations since last november 
that killed 17 civilians and damaged the guerrilla organizations 
image 
what apparently was a land mine blew up a military vehicle in 
county tyrone wounding six parttime soldiers a bomb exploded 
under a car in lisburn killing a policeman and wounding 18 people 
and a gunman killed a parttime soldier in front of his wife and 
baby daughter in belfast police said 
the irish republican army claimed responsibility for all four 
attacks the almost exclusively roman catholic guerrilla group is 
fighting to drive the british from the protestantdominated 
province and united it with the irish republic 
an ira statement issued in dublin capital of the predominantly 
catholic republic told civilians to stay away from british 
military installations in britain and europe and to avoid bars and 
discotheques patronized by offduty servicemen 
the close presence of civilians often forces us to abandon 
operations the statement said no one should travel close to 
or with clearly identified members of the british forces 
tom king britains top official for northern ireland said the 
ira message was vile and offensive 
it really is a matter of the ira trying to give the impression 
to the public that they are somehow in control of the situation 
said ken mcguinness security spokesman for the protestant ulster 
unionist party 
mcguinness also told britains channel 4 news however that the 
ira had given an answer to kings assertion last week that 
british security forces were on the way to defeating the ira 
police said a threepound bomb exploded about 340 pm tuesday 
under the car of an offduty policeman in lisburn killing the 
officer and scattering flames and debris 
at least 18 passersby were treated for minor injuries police

a senior reagan administration official 
tuesday urged congress to reject calls by savings and loan 
executives for a taxpayer bailout of their industry 
from the administrations perspective it is unnecessary to 
transfer resources from the american taxpayer said george d 
gould under secretary of the treasury for finance 
however others including the chairman of the senate banking 
committee william proxmire dwis said the problem has grown so 
large that healthy sampls cant alone assume the burden of restoring 
the rest of the business to solvency 
we are in a big black bottomless pit said herbert m 
sandler chairman of world savings and loan association in oakland 
calif 
it looks like there is virtually no way we can avoid some sort 
of hit on the treasury proxmire said 
gould the no 3 official at treasury and the administrations 
chief policymaker on banking and financial issues urged senators 
not to be spooked into hasty and drastic action by exaggerated 
estimates of the problem facing the savings industry where 500 of 
3100 institutions are considered insolvent 
some private analysts have said it will take as much as 100 
billion to restore the industry to health but gould dismissed 
those estimates as out of line he suggested that 30 billion the 
estimate of the federal home loan bank board and congress general 
accounting office is not a bad number 
however gould conceded that 50 billion was not out of the 
question particularly if the oildependent economy in texas where 
many of the insolvent sampls are located doesnt begin recovering 
whatever the size of the problem congress should turn to 
taxpayer money only after we exhaust all other available 
resources he said 
he suggested that first congress could expand the 
industryfinanced recapitalization of the federal savings and loan 
insurance corp which began last summer 
savings institutions are charged an extra assessment to pay off 
108 billion in borrowing for fslic over three years the 
administration originally urged that the industry be tapped for 15 
billion 
gould was backed by sen jake garn of utah the ranking 
republican on the committee who said im not going to ask the 
taxpayers of this country to bail out fraud mismanagement and 
abuse of managerial powers by sampls 
pressed by senators to recommend action for congress this year 
gould advised only that they pass legislation forming a blue ribbon 
commission to study the problem and report back next spring 
the senate banking committee endorsed such legislation last week 
and a house banking oversight subcommittee on tuesday urged its 
passage however the full house banking committee already voted 
3219 last week against attaching it to an unrelated banking bill 
the committee chairman rep fernand j st germain dri 
complained that the commission as proposed by rep stan parris 
rva would be too heavily weighted with appointees of president 
reagan a lame duck 
proxmire said he would propose bills to restrict insolvent sampls 
from growing a tactic critics maintain only compounds their 
problems he also advocated restricting the ability of federally 
insured thrift institutions to expand into real estate and other 
risky investment areas permitted by some states 
the top federal sampl regulator federal home loan bank board 
chairman m danny wall said his agency already limits the growth 
of insolvent sampls and was stepping up enforcement of the rule 
in an interview with several reporters after the hearing he 
said he was not opposed to a move by congress to give the sampl 
insurance fund more money by expanding the existing 
industrysupported borrowing program

government officials explained on 
tuesday the economic changes being put in place to reduce the 
budget deficit and curb tripledigit inflation and asked 
argentines to give the changes time to work 
presidential spokesman jose lopez also announced that banks and 
exchange houses which were ordered closed for two days last 
sunday will stay shut on wednesday he gave no details 
lopez said a 30 percent increase in utility rates announced 
monday night will be the only increase for the next two months 
cutbacks in public employment will be done voluntarily through 
incentives to retire 
agriculture minister ernesto figueras meanwhile met with angry 
farmers and ranchers who may have to turn in their dollars from 
export sales at a new lower commercial exchange rate this will 
give the government access to hard currency at a lower cost 
figueras later told reporters you will see once the 
confusion passes the agriculture sector will be ok 
further elements of the governments plan which may include 
devaluation were expected to be disclosed shortly 
in 30 or 40 days we cant overcome inflation but after this 
period we will arrive at the figures given by the president of the 
republic absolutely vice president victor martinez said 
president raul alfonsin says the monthly inflation rate in this 
nation of 31 million people can be reduced to below 10 percent by 
years end in june the cost of living rose by 18 percent julys 
figure still unreleased is expected to be higher 
health minister ricardo barrios arrechea said the economic 
changes are an effort to arrive by the end of the year at an 
acceptable inflation rate 
alfonsin has been plagued by economic problems since he took 
office in december 1983 argentinas foreign debt has risen to 53 
billion repayment of the interest alone consumes a major portion 
of the national budget 
inflation rose by 1212 percent in the first six months of 1988 
and by 3217 percent from the 12month period ending june 30 1988 
financial institutions have been jittery for weeks unsure about 
pending changes they refused last week to sell certificates of 
deposit for longer than seven days the interest rate was 19 
percent 
the opposition peronist party and the 3millionmember general 
labor confederation complained monday that they were not consulted 
about the changes 
alfonsin spent most of monday at his official residence in 
suburban olivos with top advisers including economy minister juan 
sourrouille central bank president jose machinea and treasury 
secretary mario brodersohn 
machinea and brodersohn returned sunday from washington where 
they reportedly negotiated a 12 billion standby loan from the 
international monetary fund 
the 106 billion budget alfonsin presented to congress two 
months ago included a 35 billion deficit and followed last 
years 8 billion shortfall 
the budget has been blocked in congress by the peronists 
while the economic adjustments under consideration are 
significant they fall short of alfonsins june 1985 overhaul that 
was when he introduced the austral as argentinas currency to 
replace an almost worthless peso froze wages and prices and put a 
cap on government employment 
success was immediate but temporary inflation dropped to its 
lowest rate in the 1980s when it hit 82 percent in 1986 but that 
rate more than doubled the following year 
the economy is shaping up as the major issue in elections that 
will be held next year 
the candidate from the governing radical civic union political 
party eduardo angeloz is seen as having little chance of 
defeating the peronist candidate carlos menem if the situation 
does not improve

wyomings crime rate has dropped so low 
that some county sheriffs say its a waste of money to keep their 
jails open 
its kind of hard to justify operating a jail with no 
prisoners in it said hot springs sheriff deloyd quarberg we 
have to do it but its not efficient 
quarberg was one of nine sheriffs contacted by the casper 
startribune who said they were concerned about the drop in jail 
populations along with quarberg sheriffs in sublette johnson 
converse crook platte lincoln washakie and campbell counties 
said the lack of inmates was making it inefficient to keep their 
jails open 24 hours a day the state has 23 counties 
johnson county sheriff larry kirkpatrick whose jail had been 
averaging five inmates a day says there have been times when we 
didnt have a prisoner there 
the same goes in converse county where sheriff john bey agrees 
with his colleagues that perhaps the state can send some work and 
money their way by paying counties to house state inmates in 
county jails 
such a move would be a real benefit to both the state and the 
counties said bey 
however state board of charities and reform officials in 
cheyenne says its unlikely that state inmates will be sent to 
county jails on a longterm basis 
i dont think theres a single jail in the state that provides 
the services that an inmate that is sentenced for a long period of 
time is entitled to said don boyer the boards 
corrections administrator 
such services include counseling access to a law library 
exercise yards and chaplains he said 
sublette county sheriff jack cain said he must staff his jail 
aroundtheclock with six employees at a cost of about 100000 
annually the sheriff said he thought about closing the facility 
but learned that would be against the law 
quarberg who said he thinks he could provide the needed 
services for state inmates is upset that his jail is partially 
empty while the penitentiary is releasing some inmates early 
because of overcrowding 
all the things that they provide at the penitentiary we 
have in hot springs county he said

vice president george bush sketching the 
outlines of a foreign policy for the 1990s said tuesday he would 
deploy a spacebased missile defense system as soon as feasible 
and would support freedom fighters around the globe 
it is not a time for timidity hesitancy and onthejob 
training he said in a dig at his democratic presidential 
opponent michael dukakis this new era demands from america and 
its elected officials firm consistent and experienced 
leadership 
bush extolled what president reagan and i have accomplished 
since taking office in 1981 
the vice president who will formally win the republican 
presidential nomination two weeks from wednesday at the partys 
national convention pledged to pursue arms control negotiations 
with the soviet union but warily in keeping with his recent 
slightly skeptical statements about soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachevs reform drive he said russia should be judged by what 
it delivers in arms reductions human rights immigration and 
easing of tensions around the globe 
the vice president also took time in his foreign policy speech 
to express satisfaction with reagans decision to permit plant 
closing legislation to become law without his signature i think 
the president made a good decision and that matter is now resolved 
and now we can get the focus where it belongs on plant openings 
bush said 
dukakis campaigned extensively against an earlier reagan veto of 
a trade bill that contained the same provision to require 60 days 
notice to employees before a plant is closed 
the vice president didnt mention that issue in his speech nor 
did he discuss his search for a vice presidential running mate on 
the latter subject fuller said only that the list of possible 
candidates had been narrowed somewhat in recent days 
bush suggested that development of the administrations 
strategic defense initiative also known as star wars might be 
critical to israels security in a remark that seemed to open up a 
new argument for the system as well as a challenge dukakis he 
said it is one thing to say you are committed to israels 
security but in an age of ballistic missiles if you are against 
defensive systems such as sdi that slogan has little meaning 
aides said the vice president was likely to deal more harshly 
with dukakis in a second speech perhaps as early as thursday in 
texas 
in boston the national issues director for the dukakis campaign 
questioned bushs logic in the sdiisrael statement 
the point makes no sense whatsoever said christopher edley 
jr israels security is no more an important argument for sdi 
than water quality or auto safety is an argument for sdi 
if the vice president wants to discuss the merits of the 
presidents space boondoggle he should explain how sdi is 
consistent with the abm treaty how the system would work given the 
unanimous scientific community agreement that it is unworkable and 
how billions more wasted on sdi will give us a stronger america 
edley said 
the vice president said reagan and he have worked successfully 
to restore american leadership and have repaired our nations 
defenses modernized our strategic nuclear forces deployed 
intermediate nuclear forces in europe and restored pride in our 
nations military services 
as for the future bush said he would continue to modernize the 
american nuclear force as we pursue a verifiable and stabilizing 
agreement for a 50 percent cut in us and soviet arsenals he 
also called for a reduction in conventional forces in europe 
he blamed democrats in congress for dragging their feet on star 
wars i am committed to deployment of sdi as soon as feasible and 
will determine the exact architecture of the system in my first 
term as the technologies are tested and proven he said as 
president i will not leave america defenseless against ballistic 
missiles 
bush called a 2995 billion pentagon budgetauthorization bill 
approved by congress last month a bad bill and said reagan 
should veto it 
congressional republicans likewise have urged a veto because the 
bill though giving reagan what he sought for the overall defense 
budget sharply reduces the white house request for star wars 
spending and also includes arms control policy restrictions opposed 
by the administration 
bush said he would work to increase the scope and momentum of 
the democratic revolution around the world 
we must support genuine freedom fighters and assist fledgling 
democrats he said he made no mention of the contra rebels 
fighting the nicaraguan government and cited no other examples 
he also said he would try to stop the spread of ballistic 
missiles around the world 
the vice president said he would place one senior official in 
charge of the us ballistic missile program and give him the 
overall responsibility for the intelligence military technical 
diplomatic and economic resources needed to respond 
bush also said he would combat drugs internationally and seek 
elimination of trade barriers around the world 
bush later returned to washington and addressed 200 people at a 
rally of ethnic leaders supporting his candidacy he told the 
bush88 coalition of american nationalities i can speak our 
language of ethnic values and pride everlasting pride in the 
united states of america 
acknowledging his own wasp background bush said many ethnic 
americans are likely to share his support for voluntary prayer in 
public schools and the death penalty

the first fully accredited japanese 
secondary school in the united states will open next spring at an 
old military academy in east tennessee farm country officials said 
tuesday 
hiroshi jo managing director of meiji gakuin university said 
the boarding school will make it possible for japanese children to 
get the education necessary for admittance to japanese universities 
without staying in japan 
many japanese who come to work in one of the 650 japanese 
companies in the united states now leave their families behind jo 
said so as not to disrupt the childrens education 
he said japanese workers in america want to know they can send 
their children to a school without anxiety and know they have a 
chance for higher education in japan 
officials said tuesday that meiji gakuin agreed to pay 25 
million to sanford gray owner of tmi academy in sweetwater for 
the grounds where the new school will be located 
tmi academy opened 114 years ago as a military school for boys 
and later became a coeducational private school it went up for 
sale early this year 
gray said the purchase includes the 45acre campus and its 12 
buildings as well as an adjacent 100acre horse farm 
jo said the new school will be called tennessee meiji gakuin 
tmg academy and plans call for it to open in april 1989 with 
about 70 high school sophomores 
the curriculum will be expanded to include junior high and high 
school grades in coming years he said with an eventual goal of 
about 200 students 
jo said the number of japanese employees in tennessee was part 
of the reason sweetwater was chosen but that japanese children 
could come from anywhere in the united states 
jo and meiji gakuin chancellor nobumichi hiraide both visited 
the tmi academy campus and toured the region jo said they visited 
with executives of the several japanese companies with facilities 
in east and middle tennessee and found widespread support for such 
a school jo said 
the children often become the victims in the increasing 
japanese investment in the united states jo said adding there are 
schools for japanese children in europe 
with the support of the japanese ministry of education we 
decided we must have on in america too he said 
gov ned mcwherter said the school will help strengthen the 
close ties of culture commerce and friendship that already exist 
between japan and tennessee 
the largest japanese employer in tennessee is the nissan truck 
plant in smyrna south of nashville japanese companies in east 
tennessee include acom which makes panasonic electric components 
in knoxville sharp matsushita and komatsu nippondenso recently 
announced it would build a 200 million manufacturing plant in 
nearby maryville

the news magazine stern on tuesday 
quoted syrias defense minister as saying a ransom of 97 million 
was paid last year to win the release of a west german businessman 
kidnapped in lebanon 
it reported defense minister mustafa tlass as saying the 
ransom for siemens technician alfred schmidt amounted to 18 million 
marks 
but the west german government and a spokesman for schmidts 
employer the siemens electronics firm repeated their denials that 
either had paid a ransom 
the federal government has neither paid nor offered any ransom 
money in the case of german hostages held in lebanon and also does 
not intend on doing that in the future said government spokesman 
norbert schaefer 
schmidt was released last september and at that time siemens 
said it had not paid a ransom 
horst siebert a spokesman for the munichbased company told 
the associated press tuesday we have not changed our previous 
statements 
the report in stern did not say who provided the money or who 
received it 
schmidt and west german businessman rufolf cordes were kidnapped 
separately in january 1987 by shiite moslem extremists when 
schmidt was released his captors said they freed him as a 
goodwill gesture 
cordes is among 18 foreigners including nine americans still 
held hostage in lebanon terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for ap has been held the longest he was kidnapped 
in beirut on march 16 1985 
stern also quoted tlass as saying that a west germanapproved 
trade for cordes collapsed following intervention by the us 
government 
he apparently referred to a possible exchange involving cordes 
and mohammed hamadi and his older brother abbas hamadi who are 
imprisoned in west germany 
schaefer said the government never considered such an exchange 
mohammed hamadi is on trial in frankfurt charged with air piracy 
and murder in the june 1985 hijacking of a trans world airlines 
jetliner to beirut a us navy diver was killed by the hijackers 
abbas hamadi was convicted by a duesseldorf court in april of 
kidnapping schmidt and cordes in an effort to force west germany to 
free his brother abbas hamadi was sentenced to 13 years in prison 
west germany refused a us extradition request for mohammed 
hamadi 
a government official testified at abbas hamadis trial that 
fears for cordes safety played was in important factor in turning 
down the us request 
schaefer said of the stern account if the syrian defense 
minister really said what stern has quoted him as saying then he 
is relying on false information 
after schmidt was freed west germany said syria helped gain his 
release 
hamburgbased stern made its report available to other news 
organizations in advance of thursdays publication

foreign minister dante caputo 
said tuesday that secretary of state george p shultzs visit to 
argentina underscores us support for this south american nations 
return to democracy 
caputo told shultz in a welcoming toast we argentines have 
not forgotten the deep support received from you those times a few 
tried to threaten argentine democracy 
shultz said in a return toast at the foreign ministry 
the people of the argentine republic have overcome great 
difficulties in returning their nation to the democratic fold 
and in establishing a social peace based on consensus and mutual 
respect 
for those who have followed your history argentinas 
political achievements over the past five years are fully worthy of 
the nation which gave birth to the liberator jose de san 
martin 
elected president raul alfonsin took office in december 1983 
ending nearly eight years of military rule 
shultz arrived tuesday from guatemala where he failed to obtain 
a condemnation of nicaraguas leftist sandinista government 
instead shultz and the foreign ministers of honduras el salvador 
costa rica and guatemala issued a declaration calling for peace 
democracy security social justice and economic development in 
central america the wordsoftening reportedly came at the 
insistence of costa rica and guatemala 
caputos mention of threats to argentinas democracy referred to 
two challenges to alfonsins government during the past 15 months 
by factions in the armed forces the reagan administration on both 
occasions publicly expressed its strong support for the government 
which brought the incidents under control 
after lunch with caputo shultz met separately with alfonsin 
economy minister juan sourrouille and carlos menem presidential 
candidate of the opposition peronist party 
sourrouille outlined the economic reforms his government is 
putting together in an attempt to reduce the budget deficit and 
curtail triple digit inflation a spokesman for the us state 
department said speaking on the condition of anonymity 
shultz is scheduled to meet wednesday with defense minister 
horacio juanarena and the governing radical civic unions candidate 
for next years presidential election eduardo angeloz 
about 8000 leftists marched downtown near government house 
tuesday evening to protest the shultz visit no incidents were 
reported 
on thursday shultz will travel to uruguay the third stop on 
his 10day ninecountry latin america tour and meet president 
julio sanguinetti 
a us embassy spokesman said shultzs visit to argentina was 
mainly symbolic its a way to pay attention to and show respect 
for their the argentines problems he said 
the spokesman also said shultz did not bring any new debt 
repayment proposals or offers of financial assistance 
argentina has a foreign debt of 53 billion and currently is 
paying only the interest and nothing on the principal alfonsin is 
under pressure from his political rivals to get the country out 
from underneath the debt burden 
menem chosen as the presidential candidate of the opposition 
peronists in a party election last month has suggested that 
argentina ask its creditors for a fiveyear grace period during 
which not a single dollar would leave argentina 
in managua nicaragua the official sandinista newspaper 
barricada said shultz had failed to persuade washingtons central 
american allies to condemn nicaragua but us pressure would 
continue 
it said the oneday visit to guatemala by shultz means a new 
level of north american pressure and blackmail aimed at blocking 
the central american peace process again that referred to the 
regional peace plan signed by the presidents of the five central 
american countries at a meeting in guatemala aug 7 1987 
the united states which supports nicaraguan rebels known as 
contras in their fight to overthrow the government claims the 
sandinistas have not complied with provisions of the plan

a spate of showers has brought shortterm relief to some of the 
nations scorched crops but farmers fear the return of 
blowtorch heat will blast what is left in their fields before 
the fall harvest 
and the drought may threaten next years crops as well experts 
say 
scattered rainfall helped some fields came too late to reverse 
drought damage in others and missed parts of the farm belt 
entirely following the showers glaring cloudless skies and 
temperatures near 100 degrees have returned 
id say were in a real blowtorch pressurecooker right now 
said indiana farmer dan donathen who has 300 acres of corn and 
soybeans in st joseph county 
weve never had temperatures like this that i can recall id 
say were going downhill real quick if it stays hot 
scorching temperatures toppled records in wisconsin minnesota 
michigan and illinois tuesday la crosse wis set a record for 
the date of 102 degrees and tied a record set in 1955 with its 35th 
day of 90 degree or hotter weather this summer in minnesota the 
twin cities set a mark with 99 degrees 
chicago hit 100 the seventh time this year the mercury has 
soared into tripledigits a new record 
up to 5 inches of rain fell recently on central illinois fields 
farmed by larry dallas and his brother in douglas county but they 
need more after a hot dry spring and early summer 
what corn there is the rain helped and weve got some 
decentsized ears said dallas who expects no more than half a 
normal harvest 
the soybeans perked up and grew a foot but it gets hot and 
dry again well lose all weve gained he said 
certainly the drought is not over said ken kunkel 
director of the midwestern climate center at champaign ill 
soil moisture reserves are very limited and it will be 
difficult to fill those kernels and pods 
rain soaked many fields in indiana ohio kentucky and southern 
illinois in recent weeks kunkel said but iowa western illinois 
southern minnesota and wisconsin got little relief 
the drought could threaten next years crop production because 
it has taken so much deep reserve moisture out of the soil 
experts say it is unlikely that hardhit areas will get enough 
rain this year to replenish the supply that will make winter snow 
and early spring rains critical 
its going to be tough to go into the spring with adequate 
soil moisture said dallas who has 560 acres in corn and 
soybeans 
for now some farmers are assessing the benefit of the latejuly 
rains 
its looking a whole lot better said kentucky farmer homer 
hurst jr of fleming county we actually cut some hay yesterday 
we reseeded 65 acres of corn and were hoping for a late fall 
a half inch of rain a week would be a lifesaver 
showers made a difference in arkansas too 
sorghum was heading out the rain made their crop said 
lonoke county extension agent blair griffin the soybeans were 
just beginning to bloom if it had continued to be dry they would 
have lost a large percentage of their crop 
farmers in other states have not been as fortunate 
its the same old story we need rain were not getting 
any said herb halvorson assistant agriculture commissioner in 
minnesota who indicated heat now may be causing more damage than 
drought 
the impact on the corn and the soybeans and the canning crops 
has been devastating 
in south dakota experts said rains came too late to save most 
crops the state approved a program to provide money to help 
farmers and ranchers replace water supplies dried up by the drought 
rain in parts of north dakota also will have limited benefit 
experts said 
its too late for most of it all the small grains said 
morton county extension agent jack stewart but there are some 
corn and sunflowers that are going to benefit from this rain 
despite some showers in july farmers in barron county wis 
have given up hope for a second hay crop and a corn harvest said 
agriculture agent don droft 
theyre green chopping corn for silage he said theyve 
given up hope of getting any corn 
dallas the central illinois farmer said one alternative is to 
sell some 1989 corn while futures prices are high hoping to raise 
that much grain next year 
after seeing a year like this it kind of freaks you out he 
said but if we could lock in 3 per bushel corn for the fall 
of 89 that would be good

missouri democrats nominated betty hearnes wife of a former 
governor for the states top job tuesday and endorsed rep 
richard gephardts lastminute bid for a seventh term in congress 
detroit voters appeared to be endorsing a ban on casino 
gambling while former congressman jim dunn jumped ahead of a 
fellow michigan millionaire in a republican primary for the right 
to challenge democratic sen donald riegle 
gambling was on the ballot also in missouri where voters were 
favoring a measure to raise the limit on the lottery jackpot 
with 7 percent of the missouri vote counted mrs hearnes who 
would be the states first woman governor had 25410 votes or 85 
percent and lavoy zaki reed a st louis area teacher had 
4574 votes or 15 percent 
its a big step youve got to cross this hurdle and then go 
for the next one mrs hearnes said early in the day republican 
gov john ashcroft seeking a second term did not face a primary 
gephardt who abandoned his bid for the presidential nomination 
just in time to file for reelection piled up 82 percent of the 
vote against three littleknown democrats 
in another missouri congressional race farm activist wayne 
cryts also swamped three opponents for the democratic nomination 
setting up a rematch with republican rep bill emerson 
detroit voters were declaring for the third time in 12 years how 
they felt about mayor coleman youngs plan to improve the economy 
with hotelcasinos and before the first votes were tallied exit 
polls conducted for wxyztv and the detroit free press said voters 
favored a ban by 60 percent to 40 percent 
the missouri amendment to let lottery officials use a higher 
percentage of sales for prize money and advertising was ahead 3832 
votes or 55 percent to 3097 or 45 percent with 1 percent of 
precincts counted 
in michigan dunn and robert huber also a former oneterm 
congressman competed for a chance to face riegle who had no 
primary opposition in his bid for a third term with 4 percent of 
the precincts reporting dunn had 9227 votes or 62 percent to 
hubers 5581 votes or 38 percent 
kansas also had primaries the only congressional incumbent 
facing a challenge gop rep jan meyers tallied 85 percent of the

detroits referendum on casino gambling generated the most heat 
of any issue in michigan young who is expected to seek 
reelection next year said casinos could bring desperately needed 
money into the city and help lower its 96 percent unemployment 
rate his position pitted him against the ministers and church 
members who in the past have formed the core of his constituency 
voters previously rejected the idea of casinos in 1976 and 1982 
the current measure was designed to put a law on the books that 
would ban casinos from detroit even should the legislature someday 
legalize gambling in the state 
huber who was in congress in 197374 and dunn who served from 
198182 had little success in winning financial support and each 
spent more than 200000 of his own money by contrast riegle who 
has not lost an election in 22 years has a 4 million warchest for 
the fall 
dunn 44 who ran unsuccessfully for a senate nomination 1984 
had the support of most party officials this time 
huber 65 the more conservative of the two emphasized his 
opposition to abortion and sought support from the partisans 
brought into the party by pat robertsons presidential campaign 
dunn said in a radio interview last week that his opponent 
regarded aids as gods punishment of homosexuals and drug users 
huber asked about dunns remarks said i dont know whether its 
the wrath of god but if it isnt it should be 
supporters of the missouri lottery amendment called it crucial 
to the future of the 2yearold games currently the lottery is 
required to give 45 percent in prizes 45 percent to the state and 
spend 10 percent on administrative costs the change would require 
only that a minimum of 45 percent go for prizes and officials say 
they want give about 50 percent in prizes 
the issue is not to give the missouri lottery more than any 
other state but rather to put it on the same playing field as 
neighboring lotteries said mike morris executive director of 
the lottery 
mrs hearnes 61 is a state representative whose husband 
warren was governor from 196573 
cryts who nearly beat emerson in the 8th district race in 1986 
was catapulted to fame in 1981 when he took his familys soybeans 
from a padlocked grain elevator 
missouri will have a senate race on the ballot in november but 
neither democratic state sen jay nixon nor republican sen john 
danforth had any primary opposition

immigration officers cannot order housing 
or labor camps to turn over their records of tenants to see if any 
are in the united states illegally a federal appeals court ruled 
tuesday 
in a case from southeast washington the 9th us circuit court 
of appeals said federal law does not authorize the immigration and 
naturalization service to issue john doe subpoenas those that 
do not name a specific individual for records of suspected 
undocumented aliens 
lawyers for managers and residents of the walla walla labor 
camp which resisted a subpoena for records of about 150 families 
in 1984 said the tactic was a departure from ins practices of over 
30 years 
we felt it was a dangerous precedent as well as being a 
tremendous invasion of privacy said dan clark a lawyer for the 
residents tenant council its a way of getting into personal 
records and doing an investigation of a whole class or group of 
people without any individualized suspicion or cause to justify 
it 
they were basically going on a fishing expedition said 
rebecca smith a lawyer for the tenants several times in the 
past the ins has contended its authority is broader than a number 
of police agencies this ruling shows that its not and that farm 
workers have the same rights as other citizens 
justice department lawyer ellen shapiro who represented the 
ins did not immediately return a phone call late tuesday 
the federally funded labor camp operated by the walla walla 
housing authority houses mostly hispanics the head of each 
household must document legal residence and lawyers for the 
tenants said an inspection by the us farmers home administration 
shortly before the case arose had found no violations 
the ins subpoena was issued by an agent who said he had arrested 
about 300 illegal aliens at the camp in 11 years 19 in 1984 and 
was continuing to receive complaints about undocumented aliens who 
were receiving housing benefits illegally 
the records sought for an unspecified criminal 
investigation covered us residency income welfare status 
vehicles and prior tenancy of all residents of the camp 
after the camp manager refused to turn over the records on 
privacy grounds us district judge robert mcnichols ruled in 
march 1986 that the subpoena was legal he noted that the internal 
revenue setvice can issue subpoenas for unnamed persons if it has a 
reasonable basis to believe they are violating the tax laws and 
said the ins had equal authority 
but the appeals court ruled 30 that the irs authority was based 
on express provisions of federal law that do not exist for the 
immigration agency 
despite the inss concededly broad subpoena and investigatory 
authority we are reluctant to assume the existence of the power to 
issue thirdparty subpoenas directed at unspecified targets where 
congress has not provided for them specifically nor provided 
procedural safeguards said the opinion by judge robert beezer 
because the court concluded that the subpoena was unauthorized 
by law beezer said it was not necessary to decide whether it also 
violated the constitutional right to privacy as argued by lawyers 
for the tenants and the american civil liberties union

a juror in the wrongful death civil 
trial of cullen davis and a victims rights group tuesday demanded 
that the bankrupt oil heir be retried for a 1976 shooting spree at 
his remote fort worth mansion that left two dead and one crippled 
condemning davis as a cold blooded killer a group called 
the alliance for justice urged tarrant county district attorney tim 
curry to reopen the 12yearold criminal case against davis he has 
been acquitted in two criminal trials 
the evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt that it was 
cullen davis who killed those people said kenneth pool 29 the 
jury foreman in a 1987 wrongful death civil trial that ended with a 
hung jury 
cullen davis got away with murder pool said with 
gods help justice can be done 
district attorney curry said davis cannot be prosecuted again 
because the double jeopardy provision of the us constitution 
prohibits us from any further prosecution of these cases 
but alliance for justice members noted that davis was tried and 
acquitted for murder of only one of the two victims of the 1976 
shooting they want him tried for the other murder 
davis a bornagain christian could not be reached for comment 
but his attorney steve sumner of dallas accused the group of 
tasteless grandstand tactics designed to gain leverage in 
civil suits still pending against his client 
the accusations against davis 55 stem from an aug 2 1976 
episode in which a man dressed in black and wearing a wig invaded 
the 6 million davis mansion and shot four persons including 
davis exwife priscilla 
mrs davis now 47 survived a gunshot wound in the chest but 
her boyfriend stan farr 30 and her daughter andrea wilborn 12 
were killed 
a mansion visitor gus bubba gavrel then 22 was crippled 
by a bullet that lodged near his spine 
an amarillo jury in 1977 acquitted davis of killing his 
stepdaughter despite the testimony of three survivors who blamed 
him for the murder 
less than a year later davis was arrested and accused of 
masterminding a separate murderforhire scheme in which he 
allegedly targeted for death a divorce judge his exwife and 
several amarillo witnesses 
a houston jury deadlocked 84 in favor of conviction in the 
murder solicitation case and a fort worth jury acquitted him in a 
retrial 
after that acquittal the district attorneys office dismissed 
charges against davis for the murder of farr and the attempted 
murder of mrs davis and gavrel 
in 1986 davis settled gus gavrels 13 million civil lawsuit 
out of court the settlement wasnt disclosed but has been reported 
to be worth about 1 million a year later a jury deadlocked 84 
against davis in a wrongful death and personal injury suit filed by 
mrs davis and her second husband jack wilborn the father of 
andrea 
mrs davis said she hasnt decided whether to continue the civil 
action 
davis later filed for bankuptcy in federal court leaving in 
limbo his exwifes civil suit and suits filed by the farr estate 
and his heirs 
i think jurors have been in awe of his money mrs davis 
said maybe now that hes supposed to be broke they wont be as 
interested in his wealth and might listen to the truth

a group of vietnameseamericans 
occupying a roman catholic church settled their lawsuit against the 
local diocese agreeing to purchase the building and turn it into a 
cultural center 
the dissidents took over the san jose property in 1986 when the 
rev paul luu dinh duong was appointed pastor of a temporary 
mission for vietnameseamericans that was housed in the church 
the protesters refused to accept duongs authority and said 
they wanted the temporary mission upgraded to a permanent parish 
where they can worship in their own language 
bishop pierre dumaine who appointed duong has refused to back 
down from his mission plan and has encouraged the vietnamese to 
attend services throughout the diocese 
the dissidents sued the san jose diocese in 1986 claiming that 
the building belonged to them the diocese bought the property for 
an undisclosed sum in 1982 
under terms of the outofcourt settlement reached late friday 
the dissidents agreed to pay 400000 for our lady queen of martyrs 
church they also promised to remove all signs identifying the 
building as a catholic church or affiliated facility 
diocese spokesman terrence sullivan said the dissidents planned 
to turn the building into a cultural center 
the protesters plan to continue prayer services religion and 
language classes for children and occasional masses said bai an 
tran leader of the dissidents 
bishop dumaine said the settlement removes a major obstacle to 
reopening discussions for a reconciliation in the catholic 
vietnamese community 
there are about 8000 catholic vietnameseamericans in the san 
jose area and they appeared about evenly split over the church 
dispute 
if the group cannot raise at least 175000 over the next 105 
days for a down payment on the building the settlement requires 
the dissidents to vacate the property

a panel of three federal judges ruled tuesday 
that louisiana has allowed unlawful segregation to persist in 
state colleges and universities despite a 1981 agreement to end 
racial bias 
despite the slight increase in black enrollment statewide the 
racial polarization has increased as a whole during the term of the 
consent decree said the unanimous opinion by us district judge 
charles schwartz jr 
the judges acknowledged however that part of the problem was 
with the consent decree itself an agreement with the us justice 
department that called for the state to encourage integration by 
spending money to improve black colleges and universities 
if money was the sole problem then there should still be 
improvement though perhaps an insufficient improvement for 
constitutional purposes in desegregation of louisianas public 
universities said schwartz 
of louisianas 20 institutions of higher education schwartz 
said those originally established as black schools southern 
universitybaton rouge southernnew orleans southernshreveport 
and grambling remain predominately black 
the court finds except for bossier parish community college 
and the st bernard parish community college that louisiana is 
continuing to operate an unlawful dual system of public higher 
education said schwartz 
the court said drastic changes may be needed to remedy remaining 
vestiges of the former segregated system 
a possible remedy that suggests itself to the court would be 
one that reduces the number of senior colleges and many of their 
duplicative programs in particular the duplication in 
institutions in the same vicinity institutes a system of junior 
colleges with open admissions to all high school graduates 
institutes a higher minimum entrance requirements to the remaining 
senior colleges and vests the state supervision over the 
institutions to a single board the opinion said 
john kennedy gov buddy roemers lawyer in the case said the 
court could order all of those changes require additional spending 
and more 
we need to settle this and do it on an innovative basis 
thats what theyre telling us said mack barham an attorney 
representing the board of regents which oversees all four of the 
states higher education panels 
lawyers for the mostly black southern university and grambling 
university systems could not be reached for comment immediately 
both the us department of justice and the state without 
admitting liability agreed in the consent decree to dismantle the 
system of higher education divided by race under state law prior to 
1954 when a landmark us supreme court outlawed segregation 
the decree was intended to resolve a 1974 lawsuit filed by the 
justice department against the state the agreement was to have 
expired dec 31 1987 but the justice department extended it 
indefinitely at the insistence of lawyers for the southern and 
grambling systems 
the court acknowledged that louisiana has spent more than 200 
million on black colleges since 1981 but the judges agreed with 
the justice departments position that louisianas failure to keep 
all the promises it made in the consent decree is the chief reason 
segregation still exists 
and in a concession to an idea that was rejected by the 1988 
legislature the court said supervision of the states colleges and 
universities perhaps should be the work of a single board rather 
than four separate ones 
a trial is scheduled for sept 22 if negotiations between the 
justice department and the state dont yield a remedy to the 
consent decree tuesdays ruling by schwartz and his colleagues was 
part of a move to dispose of all pending motions before the trial 
begins

two alcohol tankers that burned after a 
headon train collision should have been in the rear of an iowa 
interstate railroad freight train instead of the front company 
officials told federal investigators tuesday 
the tank cars which each contained 20000 gallons of denatured 
alcohol were the second and third cars in the westbound train that 
wrecked saturday killing two crewmen 
they were not placed as they should have been placed according 
to instructions that the interstate iowa railroad had given said 
edward dobranetski of the national transportation safety board 
dobranetski declined to speculate whether correct placement 
would have prevented the outbreak of fire which forced a twoday 
evacuation of 2000 residents in the altoona area just northeast of 
des moines 
investigators also confirmed tuesday that the crash happened at 
1145 am dobranetski said monday that the eastbound train had 
been ordered to stay in the altoona switching yard until 1201 pm 
interviews with the surviving crewman from the eastbound train 
showed the conductor and the engineer believed they had left early 
but dobranetski said investigators still arent sure if the 
train had left the altoona yard because there arent any signs 
showing yard limits 
federal investigators plan to wrap up their onsite 
investigation friday the ntsb is not expected to rule on the 
accidents cause for six to nine months 
iowa interstate officials hoped to resume traffic on the line 
tuesday night 
the crash occurred on what is known by railroad workers as 
dark territory a rail line lacking lighted signals to warn of 
oncoming traffic 
signals could have prevented that dobranetski said 
iowa interstate has been operating without signals because 
previous signal lights were vandalized before the railroad began 
running on the track in 1984 according to dennis shaffer the 
railroads vice president for marketing 
iowa interstate leases the track from heartland rail corp 
heartland attorney scott bannister declined to say whether lighted 
signals would have prevented the crash but noted that iowa 
interstate traffic on the line is much lighter than the traffic of 
the lines previous operator rock island lines 
neil volmer manager of engineering and safety for the iowa 
department of transportations rail division said iowa interstate 
was complying with federal railroad administration regulations by 
running trains via orders transmitted by radio or telephone from 
dispatchers

luzon island stronghold of ousted president ferdinand marcos 
others were in central luzon the central visayas islands and 
mindanao 
it was the latest in a growing series of charges of corruption 
within president corazon aquinos government 
mrs aquino who took office in february 1986 has pledged to 
curb corruption which was rampant in the marcos administration

of coastal zhejiang province chinas official xinhua news agency 
reported tuesday 
downpours from friday evening through saturday poured up to 196 
inches of rain in 12 hours on parts of five hardhit counties 
around ningbo a prosperous commercial city on the east china sea 
xinhua said water resources in floodhit areas were polluted and 
drinking water supplies were inadequate 
an official of the zhejiang provincial foreign affairs office 
identifying himself only as huang said helicopters rescued some 
people stranded by floods he said floodwaters had covered 154400 
acres of farmland about half the waters now have receded he said 
the official china daily newspaper quoted an unidentified 
official of the provincial flooding and drought combating 
department as saying tuesday that those missing were not likely

pentagon investigators have concluded that human 
error was primarily responsible for the shooting down of an iranian 
jetliner by a us warship according to published reports 
the official american report on the disaster that killed 290 
people last month says that the sophisticated radar equipment on 
board the cruiser uss vincennes functioned well abc news reported 
tuesday 
in its wednesday editions the new york times said the 
investigators believed the crew members error stemmed from the 
psychological stress of being in combat for the first time 
us navy officials have said the report will not be released 
before midaugust rear adm william m fogarty heads the team that 
is investigating the disaster fogarty presented his findings 
monday to gen george crist commander of the us central command 
the military organization responsible for all us forces in the 
mideast 
the pentagon declined to comment on the reports 
iran air flight 655 was shot down in the persian gulf while en 
route from bandar abbas iran to dubai all passengers and crew 
aboard were killed navy officials said the crew believed the plane 
was an attacking iranian fighter 
quoting an unnamed pentagon source abc news said the report 
indicates that the vincennes computerized records show that the 
plane was traveling much more slowly than the 415 nautical mph 
estimated on the day of the attack an attacking f14 jet fighter 
would have been flying faster and lower 
the report also indicates the plane was climbing rather than 
descending toward the ship as officials first said 
information on a planes speed and altitude are not presented on 
the main aegis radar screen on board the vincennes but must be 
called up separately on a smaller screen by one of the officers 
operating the system abc news said 
the network said it could not immediately be learned whether the 
report concluded that those in the ships combat information center 
misinterpreted the information on the screens or conveyed it 
inaccurately to capt will c rogers iii who made the decision to 
fire 
the times quoting unidentified officials familiar with the 
inquiry said the error stemmed from misinterpretations by radar 
operators who in the stress of battle mistakenly convinced 
themselves that the aircraft they had spotted on their screens 
was hostile 
the investigators concluded that tension aboard the vincennes 
was particularly high because the ship had just engaged in a brief 
battle with some iranian attack boats the times said noting that 
the ships crew had received extensive training but had never been 
in battle before 
the newspaper said the full conclusions of the investigators 
were not known but it is also believed that the vincennes crew 
mistook an electronic identification signal from a c130 aircraft 
at bandar abbas airfield to be from the passenger airliner 
joint chiefs of staff chairman william crowe defended rogers 
after the plane was downed american military officials said the 
plane was approaching in an attack pattern and transmitting 
militarystyle transponder signals 
iran denied both claims 
crowe is still convinced that rogers acted properly on the basis 
of information available to him abc news reported

missouri democrats on tuesday gave betty 
hearnes a chance to return to the governors mansion this time as 
chief executive rather than first lady voters also approved a 
measure to raise the limit on their lottery jackpot 
rep richard gephardt easily won the democratic nomination for a 
seventh term in congress while farm activist wayne cryts earned a 
chance for a rematch against republican rep bill emerson 
in the democratic primary for governor with 48 percent of the 
vote counted mrs hearnes who would be the states first woman 
governor had 201089 votes or 82 percent and lavoy zaki reed 
a st louis area teacher had 45338 votes or 18 percent 
republican gov john ashcroft had no primary opposition in his 
bid for a second term 
the lottery measure was ahead by 260801 votes or 58 percent to 
191294 or 42 percent with 51 percent of precincts counted 
supporters of the amendment called it crucial to the future of 
the states 2yearold games the amendment would remove current 
restrictions that now limit how much can be spent on prizes and 
adminstrative costs 
in the 3rd district gephardt was piling up 81 percent of the 
vote against three lesserknown democrats who had jumped in during 
his run for the presidency gephardt filed for reelection after 
folding his presidential bid 
cryts also swamped three opponents in the 8th district 
democratic primary

under current law the lottery gives 45 percent of proceeds to 
prizes 45 percent to the state and spends 10 percent on 
administrative costs the change would require only that a minimum 
of 45 percent go for prizes 
ideally lottery officials want to give about 50 percent in 
prizes to make the games more competitive with neighboring states 
lottery officials say without the changes the games could fold 
next spring when a special reserve fund the lottery has been using 
runs dry 
most democratic primaries for statewide posts were lopsided 
affairs with one clear favorite such as the gubernatorial primary 
where mrs hearnes a 61yearold state house member was expected 
all along to win the right to a november showdown with ashcroft 
her husband warren was governor from 196573 
cryts who nearly beat emerson in 1986 gained national 
attention in 1981 when he took his familys soybeans from a 
padlocked grain elevator 
democratic state sen jay nixon was unopposed in his bid to take 
on republican sen john danforth in november

in the realm of television programming there 
is no such thing as a sure thing but if there was one it would 
probably be columbo 
after a decade off the air abc is bringing back peter falk as 
the beloved rumpled detective in a series of movies like other 
fall shows its debut has been delayed by the writers strike 
falk told a meeting of television critics that far from balking 
at a return to the small screen as columbo i never wanted it to 
go off in the first place 
it was always a problem to find out some way whereby from my 
point of view we could do a limited number of columbos and still 
do something else so i wouldnt spend my whole life doing this 
there were movies i wanted to do 
since the show left the air in 1977 falk has had a successful 
movie career but he still is recognized worldwide as the 
character even when he was shooting a movie vibes in south 
america recently 
were in the andes mountains 18000 feet above sea level 
he said and there are these little villages indians 
descendants of the aztecs very poor little hovels i come there 
and they all run out and yell columbo 
god did not design anybody to be recognized by 2 billion 
people its something i cant get used to do you know what that 
is that they know who you are you dont know who they are 
its a strange thing this television 
executive producer william link who created columbo with 
his late partner richard levinson expects columbo to be a hit 
once again 
for one thing he says columbo is still wildly popular in 
foreign reruns for another mysteries are more popular than ever 
link is also the producer of the highly successful and 
longrunning cbs series murder she wrote 
the reason columbo remains so popular said link is that 
the format and that character met falk and it was a marriage made 
in tv heaven 
peter brought to it i think a humanity that wasnt there on 
paper he brought an everyman quality to it 
columbo will be part of a rotation series of mystery movies 
as it was in the 70s the other two movies will be gideon 
oliver starring louis gossett jr and an as yetuntitled movie 
starring burt reynolds 
link said columbo will not likely get on the air before 
january because of the writers strike and because the producers 
refuse to rush the series 
there will be no tinkering with the successful format of 
columbo he said each episode pits the seemingly dullwitted 
detective against a brilliant killer who has gotten away with a 
perfect crime until columbo hesitates turns and issues his 
tradmark line theres just one thing that bothers me 
its a rigid format were not going to change it said 
link therell be no car chases he doesnt carry a gun still 
smokes cigars still has that raincoat that probably stands up by 
itself 
the raincoat may even be the same one columbo wore during seven 
years on the air in the 70s though falk worries that the aging 
and fragile garment is not as up for a new round of crimesolving 
as he is 
the raincoat became almost as big a star as falk one of the tv 
critics was even convinced it had been enshrined in the 
smithsonian falk said no the coat he bought on 57th street in 
manhattan in 1967 is only enshrined in his closet 
i have a great deal of affection for it and i take very good 
care of it ive been known to say i put out a saucer of milk for 
it every night 
he and link get a little fuzzy on who is responsible for the 
raincoat 
falk insists the raincoat was called for in the first 
columbo script based on the stage play prescription 
murder 
i would like to get that script and see because i think it 
said in the script that he wore a raincoat falk told link 
in the stage play i remember it was a topcoat recalled 
link the screenplay prescription murder which was based on 
the play i suspect it said a topcoat i think you brought the 
raincoat

with its european sensibilities and native 
accents closer to brooklynese than a gone with the wind drawl 
new orleans hardly fits the image of a southern city 
the contrasts are obvious in the french quarter where france 
founded la nouvelle orleans in 1718 and where nearly 200yearold 
wroughtiron adorned brick buildings stand today a reminder of 
european style 
on bourbon street police have been known to watch quietly as 
college students stumble past the strip joints beer in hand the 
conservative american south is not always prevalent in new orleans 
as the republicans arrive for their national convention aug 
1518 perhaps expecting a typical southern city other 
contradictions will be evident 
hearty drinking is a favorite pastime rich food is a reason for 
living and prelenten mardi gras street parties draw a million 
people a year with parades a passion there were 281 of them in 
1987 
but all that revelry is tempered by an economic depression that 
gripped the city in 1985 and hasnt let go joblessness hovered 
around 10 percent for three years the homeless number about 8000 
in the central business district gleaming skyscrapers tower 
over the modern superdome and on the mississippi riverfront a 
glitzy new shopping mall shines 
uptown in the garden district the wealthy reside in stately 
19th century mansions lining st charles avenue but deteriorating 
row houses are a short walk away and the citys lowincome housing 
projects are plagued by crime and a burgeoning drug trade 
the good news is that recent signs indicate the worst of the bad 
times may be over 
local experts say the economy shows signs of a slow fragile 
recovery a decline in business at the second largest port in the 
nation leveled off last year and joblessness appears to have 
peaked it fell to 93 percent in june 
the republican convention is expected to help the recovery by 
spurring 137 million in spending prompting the democratic 
leadership of this democratic stronghold to welcome the gop 
republican nomineetobe george bush will be greeted by mayor 
sidney barthelemy a jesse jackson supporter running a city where 
registered democrats outnumber registered republicans 189741 to 
34853 
in addition a bipartisan welcoming committee has been working 
for more than a year to ensure that the republicans visit goes 
smoothly still conventioneers will do well to remember a few 
facts 
it rains almost every day in august the high humidity makes 
the 90 degree highs feel like 100 
jokes about the oncehapless new orleans saints football team 
are no longer in vogue they went 124 last fall for the first 
winning season in their 21year history 
pinch the tails and suck the heads is a reference to the 
best way to eat boiled crawfish 
some of the women strolling through the french quarter are men 
native cuisine is extremely spicy chicorylaced coffee is 
extremely strong 
the hurricane rum punch at pat obriens on st peter street 
tastes as innocent as koolaid but dont be fooled

when it comes to the weather in new orleans 
city officials have one bit of advice for the thousands attending 
the republican national convention 
youd be crazy not to carry an umbrella for the sun as well 
as the rain says yvonne gelpi a member of the citys gop host 
committee 
new orleans in august means high temperatures about 903 degrees 
and relative humidity that rarely dives below 50 percent 
the heat index a formula used by the national weather service 
that combines both heat and humidity hovers close to 100 
perspiration doesnt evaporate in the damp air and the only 
respite from the sticky heat comes in the form of brief 
thundershowers that hit almost every day 
convention officials plan to use awnings covered walkways and 
air conditioned convention vehicles in an attempt to help those 
unaccustomed to such unkind conditions 
hurricanes are another summer weather worry although the storms 
are more likely to threaten later in the year 
convention manager bill philips said the city would have several 
days notice should a hurricane or tropical storm form in the gulf 
and head toward the city he said plans and schedules would have to 
be adjusted on a daytoday basis to ensure conventiongoers 
safety 
but he added im more concerned about the humidity

republicans meeting in the superdome next 
week are unlikely to see a repetition of the overcrowding that kept 
many democratic delegates locked out of their partys convention in 
atlanta 
in fact it was once said that the superdome was too big to host 
a political convention 
still the republicans have chosen the home of the national 
football leagues new orleans saints as the site of their aug 
1518 convention 
twentytwo lawsuits were filed when art dealer dave dixon 
proposed building the huge domed stadium in a decaying new orleans 
railroad yard critics said the cost 163 million was too big and 
the operations would be too expensive 
but dixon and his supporters won out and since its opening in 
1975 the superdome has hosted super bowls and sugar bowls college 
basketballs final four the pope rock concerts and bigtime prize 
fights 
the centerpiece of the city the stateowned stadium sits just 
off interstate 10 280 feet high and 680 feet wide its offwhite 
polyurethane roof glows in the sunlight its anodized aluminum 
siding shimmers 
by night it glows underneath futuristic lighting 
a university of new orleans study estimates the dome has spurred 
some 26 billion in consumer spending during its first 10 years of 
operation still the state of louisiana this year will spend more 
than 9 million to cover the stadiums operating deficit 
seating for football games is more than 69000 with chairs 
added on the floor it expands to 97300 fiftytwo meeting rooms 
can accommodate several thousand more 
thats a far cry from the omni the site of the democratic 
national convention last month 
the atlanta basketball arena seats a mere 16237 construction 
of the podium and network skyboxes reduced that to about 11000 
seats during the convention on several occasions the fire marshal 
deemed the hall overcrowded and kept delegates and others with 
credentials from entering the arena 
gop convention manager bill phillips says however that the 
superdome still is not big enough 
one problem its 27 stories tall and its got a nineacre 
ceiling and we dont have enough space says phillips its 
all air 
when the republicans meet aug 1518 the stadium floor will be 
divided by a ninestory tall threeton blue curtain that was added 
sometime ago to satisfy critics who said the superdome was too big 
for some events including political conventions and rock concerts 
on one side of the curtain will be 27 trailers that serve as 
offices on the other george bush will receive the republican 
presidential nomination 
the huge red white and blue 570000 podium will be elevated 
10 feet above the floor above the podium will be three giant 
television screens 
one thing weve learned phillips said is you have to 
make things big

the citys depressed economy could benefit to 
the tune of 137 million from the republican convention but mayor 
sidney barthelemy hopes the real payoff comes later from the 
benefits of international publicity 
it may be our last chance he said or a very very rare 
opportunity 
the slump in oil prices hit this petroleum center hard tax 
revenues plummeted while unemployment in louisiana peaked last year 
at around 14 percent it remains above 10 percent 
the hard times hit right after the 1984 worlds fair proved to 
be a world class financial flop it got great reviews but never 
drew the crowds local merchants had hoped for the fair ended its 
sixmonth run in bankruptcy court with 120 million in losses 
barthelemy believes the gops decision to hold its national 
convention in the louisiana superdome may signal a reversal in the 
citys fortunes 
i think its already meant an awful lot he said we were 
kind of on a down side from the worlds fair as far as the national 
media was concerned 
with 31000 people expected this wont be the largest 
convention for new orleans sixty thousand attended a religious 
conference last year and 35000 shriners met in april 
but the gop convention promises to attract the most money and 
the most media attention 
to make sure the publicity is good elected officials and 
community leaders formed a host committee 17 months ago more than 
10000 volunteers are sorting mail answering phones and painting 
signs 
chief executive officers from the fortune 500 companies have 
been invited to town for the convention and helicopter tours of 
industrial areas are planned for those who want a better look 
visiting journalists already are being flooded with information 
about the state including a list of new orleans restaurants that 
will stay open to feed them after latenight deadlines 
the city is going to be on national and international 
newspapers and television for a week said barthelemy you 
cant buy that kind of publicity 
to serve as host for the convention the city agreed to raise 
about 55 million from private sources to pay for sound and 
lighting systems in the superdome and other construction projects 
after a slow start collections are now said to be on track 
if projections in a university of new orleans economic study pan 
out the money will be a good investment 
that study breaks down like this 
with each of 21000 hotel rooms filled for an average of seven 
days hotels will rake in more than 15 million 
about 31500 conventiongoers are expected to spend an average 
of 100 a day and generate more than 22 million during convention 
week 
some 200 convention staffers who took up fulltime residence 
here prior to the convention some as early as march will generate 
an additional 2 million 
even if construction spending is only 62 percent of what it was 
during the detroit gop convention in 1980 it will total 15 
million 
the host committee is spending 650000 bringing total 
projected direct spending to more than 55 million 
on the theory that each dollar spent will be spent again 
sometimes twice a multiplier of 15 was applied adding 82 
million to the 55 million for a total impact of more than 137 
million 
state tax revenue would reach 57 million under those 
projections city tax revenue 42 million 
by contrast advance projections for the democrats gathering in 
atlanta put the impact on the local economy at about 60 million

cajun spices a 629page creole cookbook a 
bag of grits gocups and strands of cheap plastic beads fill the 
gift bags that new orleans officials hope will provide a taste of 
their city to republican delegates 
this effusion of corporate and institutional goodwill is part of 
the welcome for the 2277 delegates and thousands of alternates who 
will descend upon new orleans aug 1518 for the republican 
national convention 
i hate to put a dollar value on goodwill but i would guess 
theres about 300 to 400 worth of stuff in each bag said 
winnie beuerman a staff member on the committee putting together 
the gift bags 
in fact bottle stoppers hot sauces recipe cards pens 
binoculars two types of shampoo and hair conditioner key rings 
and even red white and blue pompons forced the original canvas 
tote bags to runneth over 
a container company stepped in and provided thousands of 
specially printed paper bags for grouping items in the 5000 tote 
bags and the state office of tourism sent plastic bags 
among the items in the bags are the famed gocups printed 
plastic cups that are part of two of new orleans most popular 
traditions drinking and mardi gras 
the cups first surfaced at french quarter bars where patrons 
who departed before finishing their drinks discovered that in new 
orleans you can take your liquor with you 
carnival parade groups riding the floats during mardi gras soon 
began tossing out specially decorated gocups along with the famed 
strings of plastic beads 
the most notable liquids in the gift bags are the bottles of hot 
pepper sauce provided by four separate companies enough to allow 
a tastetesting for the brave or foolhardy a fifth company sent 
barbecue sauce 
a halfdozen different companies sent spices generally 
allpurpose cajun mixes many of those companies also included 
recipe cards 
for the cooks interested in more detailed recipes than open 
jar and shake the timespicayune newspaper provided its 629page 
creole cookbook a clothbound annotated reprint of a cookbook it 
originally published in 1901 
a local gallery also has given donated lithographs by two 
postimpressionist artists 
some of the companies apparently gave thought to what might be 
useful in the immense superdome those whose seats are far from the 
podium can use the binoculars while anyone who doesnt have a sign 
or an american flag can shake the red white and blue pompons 
if the chockfull bags are still not enough delegates can 
choose from a vast collection of souvenirs being offered for sale 
including tshirts baseball caps sweaters scarves hankies and 
even bobby socks with the gop or convention logos 
one tshirt bears the drawing of an animal half pachyderm half 
reptile and carrying a pennant that says louisiana elegators 
never forget to vote 
there are sterling silver addanelephant necklaces each 15 
link a gop logo and a chunky white bracelet and earrings bearing 
the logo suspenders with the words republican convention also are 
available 
believe it or not weve got boxer shorts said david rains 
vice president of sports novelties inc of duncanville texas 
one of them has the logo all over another would embarrass me to 
tell you about its a comic design 
sports novelties inc is screening those companies who want to 
use the logo or to sell their wares in a convention marketplace to 
be set up in and near the superdome 
perhaps the most expensive souvenir is a goldandsilver version 
of a wooden childs puzzle showing an elephant charging out of a 
map of louisiana the map is blank except for the superdome which 
marks new orleans 
its going to be 14karat gold and sterling silver the tusks 
will be gold the feet gold said fanny m berdugo of sports 
novelties the puzzle will retail for 2500 
she said there will be 200 of those puzzles made and 1000 
sterling silver puzzles selling for 150 each the 6000 wooden 
ones will sell for 40 each 
some retailers however lost so much money on souvenirs for the 
1984 worlds fair and pope john paul iis visit last year that they 
are shying away from souvenirs at the convention 
we are not going to carry the republican convention souvenirs 
we have no space for it said john salles manager of a gift shop 
just down the block from some of the biggest hotels on canal street 
to allay concerns sports novelties is modifying many of its 
usual policies for instance stores can buy as few as 36 tshirts 
or a dozen glasses rather than the usual minimum orders of 144 
tshirts or a case of 36 glasses and about 30 items can be 
delivered on threeday notice rains said 
new orleans officials have a reason for supporting sales of 
official souvenirs money from those sales will help the city meet 
its 55 million share of convention expenses

gillette co has fended off another possible 
takeover attempt by settling lawsuits with coniston partners 
stemming from their bitter proxy fight earlier this year 
as part of the settlement outlined monday gillette will buy 
back an estimated 16 million shares at 45 each or a total of 720 
million 
the deal also contains a standstill agreement under which 
coniston is barred from buying significant numbers of gillette 
shares participating in any proxy contest or otherwise seeking 
control of the company for three years 
the settlement ends conistons suit over the april 21 proxy vote 
it lost to gillette as a result the personal care products giant 
does not face a rerun of the election 
a federal judge said last month he was inclined to order a new 
vote which many observers thought would favor coniston because 
gillette misled stockholders in an advertisement about coniston 
before the election 
under terms of the settlement all gillette stockholders may 
sell one share back to the company at 45 for each seven they own 
gillette officials estimated that 16 million of the companys 
112 million outstanding shares likely would be purchased under the 
settlement 
gillette has relied on standstill agreements and stock buybacks 
in the past to fend off unwanted suitors 
after revlon groups failed bid for gillette in 1986 gillette 
paid 558 million to buy back 92 million shares of stock and got 
revlon chairman ronald o perelman to make a similar standstill 
agreement 
in addition gillette has reached a series of other standstill 
agreements with potential suitors since then the companys failure 
to disclose the agreements during its proxy fight with coniston was 
another issue in its legal dispute with the partnership 
edward froelich an analyst with pershing amp co said monday 
that the latest settlement means gillette management wants to 
keep the status quo but theyre shrinking the capital and diluting 
earnings a bit 
froelich said the company would be able to continue fighting off 
such overtures as long as they keep the earnings rising and they 
have i dont think the stockholders will be too badly off 
gillette stock fell 262 a share to 3750 in composite 
trading monday on the new york stock exchange 
coniston which owns nearly 6 percent of gillettes outstanding 
shares waged the proxy battle earlier this year in an effort to 
win four directors seats and pressure the 12member gillette board 
to sell the company coniston believes a sale would boost the value 
of gillette stock 
gillette filed suit april 14 to block conistons proxy bid on 
the grounds that coniston falsified securities and exchange 
commission filings and did not fully disclose all its investors 
coniston countersued alleging gillette misrepresented the 
partnership in advertisements and mailings to the companys 27000 
shareholders and failed to publicly disclose all companies that had 
expressed interest in buying gillette 
us district court judge mark l wolf ruled in early april that 
gillette inaccurately portrayed coniston in newspaper 
advertisements leading up to the proxy vote in which shareholders 
rejected conistons slate of four director candidates 
paul tierney jr a coniston general partner issued a statement 
monday saying we believe this settlement at this time is in the 
best interests of all concerned 
joan fitzgerald a spokeswoman for gillette maintained that 
all shareholders will benefit from the repurchase agreement and 
said it was similar to the stock buyback plan the company began in 
1986 prior to conistons action

a strike by railroad workers against chicago amp 
north western transportation co cannot be avoided and an extended 
coolingoff period would only prolong the inevitable a company 
official says 
sen paul simon dill planned to introduce legislation today 
to extend a coolingoff period in the labor dispute for 36 days 
hoping to avert a strike thursday that would disrupt rail service 
to 41000 chicagoarea commuters and stall midwest freight 
but an official of cnw corp the railroads parent firm said 
late monday night such a move would be fruitless since the united 
transportation union had rejected the companys latest compromise 
offer 
all it would do is prolong the inevitable said james foote 
assistant vice president of communications for the chicagobased 
company eventually theres going to have to be a strike over 
this issue there appears to be no way around it 
the unions general chairman donald markgraf did not return a 
telephone message left at his home monday night seeking a response 
to footes comments 
the dispute revolves around the railroads plans to save 51 
million a year by cutting the size of most train crews from four to 
two people the company wants to eliminate what it considers 
unnecessary brakemens jobs leaving an engineer and conductor on 
board a move the union vigorously opposes 
these work rules date back to the steam engine era foote 
said weve compromised and compromised and compromised but the 
union has remained steadfast on this issue 
in its latest proposal the railroad offered monday to accept a 
recommendation by a presidential emergency board and eliminate 700 
brakemens jobs instead of the 1150 cuts it has been planning to 
make 
but union general counsel robert hart said such a compromise was 
unacceptable and would not settle the dispute as the 1201 am 
thursday strike deadline loomed 
in washington simon spokesman david carle said the illinois 
senator would propose an extension of the coolingoff period 
imposed by president reagan to give both sides breathing room 
to come up with a solution 
foote said however he did not see any reason for such a step 
because more than two years of negotiations with the union have 
failed to solve the dispute 
the presidential emergency board appointed by reagan to resolve 
the dispute recommended in july that all the railroads freight 
trains be operated with three brakemen instead of four and that 
only two brakemen be used on certain nonstop freight trains foote 
said 
the railroad initially rejected that proposal but said monday 
it would accept it in hopes of averting a walkout 
a strike would affect commuters in a sixcounty area around 
chicago for whom campnw provides service through an agreement with 
metra a suburban commuter rail service 
it also could affect freight service in several midwestern 
states but foote said campnw had trained management personnel to 
perform the unionized jobs and planned to operate its freight 
service constituting 95 percent of its business throughout any 
strike 
foote said the railroad would not resume commuter service 
because of the potential for vandalism or other problems during a 
strike 
were prepared to operate our freight lines for however long 
it takes foote said as long as were under a strike 
situation we will not operate our commuter rail lines because 
every day that goes by the union will become more desperate 
metra chairman jeff ladd said monday both sides are acting 
with callous disregard to the public by failing to settle the 
dispute 
ladd and samuel skinner chairman of the regional transportation 
authority that oversees chicagoarea commuter rail service urged 
both sides to resume negotiations because a strike would cause 
chaos throughout the suburbs 
campnws freight operations run on 6400 miles of track with 8000 
employees in illinois iowa kansas michigan minnesota missouri 
nebraska south dakota wisconsin and wyoming 
campnw ranks eighth among us railroads in revenue generating 
8935 million last year by moving 17 million carloads of freight

rusty jones inc says it is scrapping warranties 
on the companys car rustproofing products because of competition 
from automakers a move its rivals predicted could put the firm 
out of business 
mark drinan a vice president of chicagobased rusty jones said 
monday the company would not issue warranties on cars sold or 
treated with rustproofing aug 1 or later the company also 
announced it was completely suspending sales in new york because 
that state requires warranties on all rustproofing products 
drinan acknowledged that ending warranties might force rusty 
jones out of business altogether because consumers may be unwilling 
to buy the product without a warranty 
drinan said the company was withdrawing its warranties because 
of increased competition since the nations major automakers 
introduced in early 1987 limited six or sevenyear warranties 
against holes caused by rust 
im not really excited about the prospects for rusty jones 
now said william pochiluk president of autofacts inc of 
paoli pa an automotive research and consulting firm 
if i were a dealer i think id have a hard time giving rusty 
jones away without a warranty much less trying to sell it 
pochiluk said theres going to have to be massive price slashing 
to sell the product the extended rustproof warranties from detroit 
certainly had an effect on rusty jones decision 
officials of rusty jones and beatrice co which acquired the 
rustproofer in 1984 would make no predictions on the future 
asked if the decision to drop the warranties meant rusty jones 
would go out of business michael mater president of the beatrice 
subsidiary said reviews are taking place things are being 
looked at i hope its not the end 
drinan refused to say how much rusty jones sales have decreased 
since the automakers started their warranty program 
he refused to provide the companys 1987 earnings or revenues 
drinan also would not say how many outlets rusty jones has across 
the country although he said its operations were concentrated east 
of the mississippi river and north of the masondixon line 
rusty jones warranties covered holes in the autos body caused 
by rust the length of the warranties varied from several years to 
the life of the vehicle depending on conditions drinan said 
under a warranty a customer had the option of receiving the 
cost of the repairs or a full refund for rusty jones treatment 
drinan said 
the automakers also now offer repairs if rust develops drinan 
said 
warranties for treatments done before august 1 will still be 
valid drinan said

oil ministers of the sixnation gulf cooperation 
council may meet in september to discuss the glut on the world oil 
market and the stability of oil prices the kuwait news agency 
reported 
citing unidentified sources kuna said tuesday that the gcc 
secretariat is consulting with the oil ministers of the six nations 
to finalize an exact date for the meeting at the organizations 
headquarters in riyadh saudi arabia 
the gcc is comprised of four members of the 13nation 
organization of petroleum exporting countries saudi arabia 
kuwait qatar and the united arab emirates along with bahrain and 
oman 
the sources said the ministers were keen to find a way to drive 
oil prices up to the opec benchmark of 18 a barrel a barrel is 
equivalent to 42 gallons 
kunas sources said the gcc ministers were expected to appeal to 
the opec member states to adhere until the end of the year to the 
individual production quotas to absorb the surplus on the world 
market and thereby bolster oil prices 
oil prices have been running about 3 a barrel below the opec 
benchmark

increases in oil production could push oil prices to further 
deterioration if the member states do not adhere to the official 
decisions agreed upon

fivemember pricemonitoring committee this week kuna said the 
committee comprised of the oil ministers of saudi arabia 
venezuela algeria indonesia and nigeria is scheduled to begin

currently producing almost double its assigned oil quota and 
insisting on having the same quota as iran the iranians have been

a half century ago the russell clan left 
wall street for the much quieter avenues of tacoma today even 
though he keeps a minutebyminute watch on new york markets 
george russell has no desire to trade his view of puget sound for 
manhattan 
russell runs the frank russell group of companies named for 
his grandfather which advises pension funds and other large pools 
of capital on how to make the most money with the least risk 
clients include 40 of the largest us corporations among 
them international business machines corp general motors corp 
boeing co hearst corp and xerox corp plus a growing number of 
foreign companies foundations profitsharing plans and a few very 
rich individuals 
in all russell clients have holdings totaling about 240 
billion 
the 56yearold russell pioneered the idea of tracking 
performance of money managers so pension funds can rely on more 
than just intuition in deciding where to entrust their assets 
the privately held company now employs about 700 people and has 
annual revenues in the neighborhood of 100 million russell 
says 
hes proud of a new home office due to open in downtown tacoma 
this fall a telescope in his current headquarters lets visitors 
monitor the new buildings progress moreover hes proud the 
companys been able to make it in tacoma a city that suits his 
style 
i had a chance to go to wall street and didnt choose to get 
into that herdtype thoughtprocess he said 
if youre on wall street what youve got is a beeper on your 
belt and if you dont answer that beeper 24 hours a day youre 
not going to get your bonus at the end of the year 
we look at it quite differently and maybe its because were 
in tacoma i dont know but it seems to me that we ought to have 
the family beeper on the belt and if the family yells for help then 
the person ought to go solve that problem and then come do the 
business work 
in his line of work things will never improve unless the 
people that are in charge hire people that are smarter than they 
are russell said 
if you get the priorities in the right place to begin with as 
you run a business and you put the people ahead of the business 
then theyll eventually realize they can have fun in life too and 
the business will be fun too 
russells office reflects his workhardbuthavefun beliefs 
folding doors screen off a narrow walllength work area from the 
rest of the room which is filled with comfy furniture and 
photographs of his family the northwest and his 60foot yacht 
the boat he says has entertained a lot of clients if you 
come to new york you go out to a fine restauraunt in tacoma your 
options are different 
russell defines his outfit as asset management consultants 
three words that take him about 30 minutes to explain this is 
not an easy organization to understand he conceded 
besides advising the 40 corporate pension accounts the company 
gathers and sells statistics on money managers runs mutual funds 
for bank trust departments operates a brokerage house and offers 
investment funds and advice for smaller clients including 
endowments foundations and individuals 
it also has developed indexes for measuring stock and real 
estate performance including the russell 2000 and russell 3000 
indexes traded on the new york futures exchange 
if you think of a compass we pretty much on the consulting 
side are covering 360 degrees russell said 
doing so has brought his privately held company 25 percent 
growth in each of the past 15 years he says 
the staff hes put together has been helpful to us in deciding 
what we want to do in making investment decisions said al 
wolfarth assistant treasurer for pensions at monsanto corp which 
has used russell since 1974 in a field with many good companies 
wolfarth said i would refer to the russell firm as the cadillac 
of the industry 
russells grandfather frank started the company in 1936 when 
he retired as a merrill lynch broker to come to tacoma where his 
son was a newspaper executive he kept busy as an investment 
counselor and by running a small mutual fund 
all his friends were in it there were about 176 stockholders 
and 300000 in assets george russell said 
russell joined his grandfather when he graduated from harvard 
university in 1958 he took over the firm two months later when his 
grandfather died 
it prospered with about 300 salesmen by 1965 selling mutual 
funds life insurance and real estate syndication but the fact 
was that i didnt feel that we were adding any particular value 
russell said there were a lot of people doing what we were 
doing 
about 1968 he says he began looking at pension accounts which 
then were usually in conservative investments and managed by one 
person generally selected for some political reason a few 
years earlier researcher peter dietz later hired by russell had 
come up with a set of formulas for tracking pension fund 
performance 
in 1969 russell made a cold telephone call to jc penney co 
and sold the treasurer on a service to provide information on where 
to put penneys pension money penney was the first client in 
russells core consulting company which he limits to 40 clients 
more cold calls and wordofmouth advertising helped the company 
grow in 1979 russell opened a london office and later added 
offices in sydney tokyo and toronto each foreign office also 
limits its list of clients which include rolls royce and the 
largest banks in australia and japan 
by limiting clients russell says they get better service and 
he gets a stable business in the last 19 years there have been 
only 10 changes in the list he says 
after this long time were quite happy said client 
wolfarth dont tell george that because we try to keep them on 
edge once in a while

most corn and soybean futures opened sharply 
higher today on the chicago board of trade as crops continued to 
bake in the heat wave gripping the droughtstricken farm belt 
wheat opened slightly lower 
demand for soybean futures was especially strong following the 
agriculture departments weekly crop progress survey which found 
soybean plants blooming on 76 percent of the soybean acreage in the 
top 19 producing states 
youre looking at most of the beans in the most critical stage 
of yield determination the podsetting and podfilling stage 
said cathy leow a grain market analyst in new york with thomson 
mckinnon securities inc given that and given the adverse 
weather the bean market is showing strength 
but she said fears of severe yield reductions were tempered by 
the national weather services latest 6to10day outlook which 
predicted normal rainfall and aboveaverage temperatures in the 
midwest and the northern plains during the first five days of next 
week 
wheat opened slightly lower partly in reaction to the usdas 
rejection of chinas bid for 600000 metric tons of subsidized us 
wheat analysts said 
in early trading wheat was 3 cents to 4 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in september at 377 a bushel corn was 5 
cents lower to 13 cents higher with september at 303 a bushel

president reagan said today he will 
reluctantly allow a plantclosing bill that he called bad 
legislation to become law without his signature 
while reagan called the bill requiring companies to give 60 days 
advance notice of plant closing or layoffs of 50 or more workers 
a dangerous step down a road of european labor policy he 
acknowledged the political realities of public support for the 
measure 
in the national interest and to end these political 
shenanigans and get on with the business of the nation i have 
decided to allow the plant closing bill to become law but without 
my signature he said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the bill had become 
a political football that was being used by democrats more 
interested in scoring political points with organized labor to 
hold up trade legislation 
sometimes you have to take a touchback in order to get better 
field position fitzwater said the political show that the 
democrats have put on over this bill is evident to everyone 
sen edward m kennedy dmass called reagans decision a 
victory for communities across the country a victory for americas 
competitive position in the world and a victory for common sense in 
the federal budget 
senate democratic leader robert c byrd of west virginia 
congratulated reagan on what he called a good law for the 
american working people 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said after meeting 
with reagan earlier today that the presidents intention in not 
exercising a veto was to prod congress into action on other 
legislation rather than to take some heat off likely republican 
presidential candidate george bush 
dole said reagan is swallowing something that he doesnt 
totally like in order to get us off the dime on separate 
legislation overhauling the us trade laws 
the senator noted that there are only 25 to 28 legislative days 
remaining in this session and that several crucial issues remain 
including new assistance to the nicaraguan rebels and drought 
assistance to farmers 
assistant republican leader alan k simpson of wyoming said 
there are no more than 23 votes in the senate for upholding a veto 
saying the reality is its a very difficult exercise to get 34 
the number of votes necessary 
dole said that reagan very much wants a trade bill passed 
during this session and said the president is willing to swallow 
a little bit even though he doesnt like it 
both dole and simpson have been mentioned as possible vice 
presidential running mates with bush both said they did not think 
politics played any role in reagans indication that he intends to 
let the bill become law 
i havent lost a bit of sleep thinking about that simpson 
said 
house republican whip trent lott of mississippi said that while 
there might be a chance in the house to sustain a reagan veto of 
the plantclosing bill it would be very difficult 
the battle is over and we ought to move on to the next 
issue lott said he said that congressional democrats would 
merely attach the same plantclosing provision to subsequent 
legislation if a veto were upheld and said that lawmakers 
should not play with this cat any longer

illinois central railroad saw the drought coming 
and geared up to handle the mountains of grain and coal diverted to 
the rails when mississippi river levels dropped too low for barge 
traffic railroad officails say 
while barges were stranded in shallow water the ic whose 
tracks have paralleled the river for 137 years was chugging 
along bringing grain and coal from illinois to the south 
in the first 26 days of july the ic moved 9201 carloads of 
corn and soybeans from illinois to elevators between baton rouge 
la and new orleans 4815 more carloads than in the same period 
last year the chicago tribune reported in todays editions 
in the same period coal shipments totaled 12972 cars an 
increase of 4361 loads and chemical carloads were up 8500 from a 
year earlier the tribune reported 
the report quoted railroad officials as saying that last spring 
before the impact of the drought was felt in the midwest illinois 
central hired consultants to study water levels in the mississippi 
when the consultants concluded 1988 would be an extremely 
difficult year for barge operators who depend on deep water to move 
their towboats the railroad began stockpiling rail cars and other 
equipment officials said 
the preparations paid off 
weve never made a profit in july since 1851 said harry j 
bruce chairman and chief executive officer of the railroad 
this year the carrier went beyond the breakeven point 
bruce said though he would not indicate the exact profit 
the railroads consultants have said the low river levels will 
last into the winter causing ice jams to form earlier than usual 
bruce said 
this also will mean more business for the railroad he said 
the new business isnt the result of an aberration that just 
happened since easter bruce said 
the situation has been coming on for about 10 years with the 
declining water levels 
he said he hopes the recent traffic surge provides an 
opportunity for the railroad to demonstrate to shippers that it can 
handle their commodities regularly not just when barges are 
stranded 
i dont want to be their fire department bruce said

the government said today its chief 
forecasting gauge of future economic activity shot up 14 percent 
in june the biggest increase in 18 months 
the big advance in the commerce departments index of leading 
indicators provided fresh evidence that the current recovery which 
has already lasted a peacetime record of 69 months is in no danger 
of collapsing 
in other economic news the government reported today that 
orders to us factories surged 55 percent in june to a record 
2298 billion it was the biggest monthly increase in 17 years and 
was credited to the sharpest rise in military demand since december 
1982 
in a third report the government said that sales of new 
singlefamily homes shot up 84 percent in june to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 734000 units the fastest sales pace since 
february 1987 
analysts said the string of reports while reflecting a strong 
pace of business activity also increased fears that the economy 
was overheating with higher inflation pressures likely in coming 
months 
those fears were evident in the stock market today where prices 
headed lower after an early advance the dow jones average of 30 
industrials was off 711 at 212340 at noontime and falling issues 
outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in the overall tally of new 
york stock exchangelisted issues 
but in the credit markets bond traders shrugged off the 
inflation worries took their cue from a rising dollar and pushed 
prices higher at midday the treasurys closely watched 30year 
bond was up about 625 for every 1000 in face value while its 
yield fell to 909 percent from 915 percent late monday 
analysts said the increase in the leading index was in large 
part a rebound from may when the index had dropped a sharp 08 
percent 
the june advance was the biggest onemonth gain since the index 
rose by 22 percent in december 1986 it was the latest in a string 
of reports reflecting betterthanexpected economic growth this 
year 
the government said last week that the economy as measured by 
the gross national product expanded at a 31 percent annual rate 
from april through june this robust growth helped to push the 
unemployment rate down to a 14year low of 53 percent in june 
this performance was a far cry from the recession that many 
analysts were predicting in the wake of last octobers stock market 
crash 
in june the strength in the leading index was widespread with 
seven of the available nine components registering advances 
the biggest source of strength came from a 57 percent rise in 
stock prices in june the increase in the standard amp poors index 
of 500 stocks was followed by a slowdown in business deliveries 
considered a sign of increasing demand an increase in plant and 
equipment orders a drop in unemployment claims an increase in 
building permits a change in raw materials prices and a rise in 
the money supply 
one indicator orders for consumer goods was a negative factor 
on the index and one other indicator the length of the average 
workweek was unchanged in june 
the 14 percent rise left the overall index at 1940 percent of 
its 1967 base of 100 
the economy has been bolstered this year by a boom in us 
export sales and heavy business investemnt the gnp the total 
output of goods and services grew at an annual rate of 34 percent 
in the first quarter and 31 percent in the second quarter 
the reagan administration which began the year forecasting gnp 
growth for all of 1988 at a lackluster 24 percent is now 
forecasting growth of around 3 percent when measured from the 
fourth quarter of 1987 
this is in line with the view of many private analysts who see 
the economy slowing from the 33 percent average rate in the first 
six months of the year 
david wyss an economist with data resources inc a lexington 
mass forecasting firm said he expected the gnp would grow about 
28 percent this year about the same as dri was predicting before 
last octobers stock market crash 
we still expect the second half to be a little slower than the 
first but the first half was very good he said we will have 
a much better year than everyone assumed right after the market 
crash 
david berson chief economic forecaster at the federal national 
mortgage association predicted the gnp would expand at an annual 
rate of 26 percent from july through december 
he said interest rates are likely to continue rising even with 
this slight slowdown in growth as the federal reserve continues to 
worry about inflationary pressures from tight labor markets and 
high factory operating rates 
as a consequence of further fed credit tightening berson 
forecast that a wide variety of interest rates would head higher as 
well with mortgage rates now at 105 percent climbing above 115 
percent next year

corn and soybean futures closed mostly higher 
tuesday on the chicago board of trade while droughtstunted crops 
baked in a sizzling midwestern heat wave 
but forecasts for scattered showers in the corn belt later this 
week limited gains in the potentially explosive corn and soybean 
markets and wheat closed lower on disappointing export news 
analysts said 
were quite surprised that with this heat out there the 
markets arent doing better than they did said john frazier a 
grain market specialist in chicago with balfour maclaine corp 
the closely watched soybean crop in the central farm belt is in 
the midst of a critical poddevelopment and podfilling stage that 
will last about three more weeks frazier said the soybeans need 
cooler weather and moisture during that period to avoid severe 
yield losses he said 
our soybean production forecasts are dropping daily 
frazier said 
wheat prices fell partly in reaction to the usdas rejection of 
chinas bid for 600000 metric tons of subsidized us wheat 
analysts said 
at the close wheat was 1 cents to 6 cents lower with september 
at 375 a bushel corn was 10 cents lower to 11 cents higher 
with september at 301 a bushel oats were 1 cent lower to 8 
cents higher with september at 290 a bushel and soybeans were 15

a group of hecks inc stockholders 
said tuesday it opposed a recently filed company reorganization 
plan because it dilutes its shares 
the plan filed late monday has what was described as crucial 
support of the discount retail chains creditors committees said 
maarten hemsley hecks chief financial officer 
were excited by having accomplished this hemsley said 
its has been a major hurdle 
but robert miller an attorney for the shareholders committee 
said his group opposes the plan and called it illegal and 
unfeasible 
among other things the plan illegally denigrates the 
shareholders rights in favor of a sweetheart deal for 
management miller said tuesday 
hecks filed for protection from its creditors under chapter 11 
of federal bankruptcy laws a year ago 
under the 60page plan hecks would issue new stock to replace

on other markets coffee futures plunged again cotton was 
sharply lower livestock and meat futures were mostly lower 
precious metals slipped energy futures declined and stockindex

degrees on tuesday were quite surprised that with this heat out 
there the markets arent doing better than they did said john 
frazier a grain market specialist in chicago with balfour maclaine 
corp 
frazier said buying was limited by traders memories of steep 
losses in the soybean market during the previous two weeks and by 
at least one private forecasters prediction of widely scattered 
showers in the corn belt during the rest of the week 
experts said the closely watched central midwestern soybean crop 
was in the midst of a critical poddevelopment and podfilling 
stage that will last about three more weeks 
but the soybeans need cooler temperatures and more moisture to 
avoid severe damage and frazier said his companys soybean 
production estimates were falling daily 
as we do our crop tours were finding a tremendous number of 
bean stalks that have very few pods if any pods at all he said 
the national weather service has predicted normal precipitation 
and aboveaverage temperatures for the corn belt during the first 
five days of next week but the market disregarded the forecast 
its difficult to make a forecast any more than four or five 
days out said cathy leow assistant vice president in charge of 
grain futures trading with thomson mckinnon securities inc in new 
york 
corn and oat futures followed the soybean market while wheat 
prices fell partly in reaction to news that the agriculture

the september coffee contract settled 784 cents lower at 
10883 a pound compared with 13295 cents a pound just one week 
ago 
cotton futures fell to new lifeofcontract lows for all 
delivery months except october on the new york cotton exchange 
after a usda report showed the cotton crop improving analysts said 
october cotton settled 113 cents lower at 5502 cents a pound 
sagging demand for beef weighed on the cattle futures market at 
the chicago mercantile exchange and the bearish sentiment spilled 
over into the neighboring pork pits said dale durchholz livestock 
analyst with agrivisor services inc in bloomington ill 
live cattle settled 28 cent to 133 cents lower with august at 
6505 cents a pound feeder cattle were 15 cent to 78 cent lower

ounce silver was 75 cents to 79 cents lower with september at

to consider their disclosure obligations in connection with issues 
arising from the governments defense contract procurement 
inquiry

known to be part of the scandal

review on an ongoing basis the need for appropriate disclosure

senate leaders pushed tuesday for speedy floor 
action on a major trade bill only hours after president reagan 
reluctantly agreed not to veto legislation requiring companies to 
provide advance notice of plant closings and mass layoffs 
the president wanted a trade bill thats why he swallowed 
the plant closings said minority leader robert dole rkan as 
the senate began debate on the 1000page bill that is intended to 
curb us trade deficits 
the senate had been waiting to act on the trade bill which the 
house passed 37645 on july 13 there had been an implied threat 
that the trade bill might die if reagan balked at signing the 
plantclosings bill 
reagan vetoed an earlier version of the trade bill largely 
because it included the plantclosing provision he opposed that 
section was removed and passed separately by vetoproof margins in 
the house and senate 
the latest version of the trade bill would give the 
administration urgently sought authority to make agreements in the 
current uruguay round of international trade talks and would 
assure accelerated congressional approval of any such deals 
majority leader robert c byrd dwva expressed hope the 
senate would approve the housepassed trade bill without amendments 
and send it quickly to the president for signing 
before recessing for the night byrd announced tentative plans 
to vote on the bill wednesday but leaders failed to dissuade 
senators from offering amendments they had sought to do so as a 
way of hastening the bill directly to reagans desk and avoiding 
the potential quagmire of negotiations to resolve differences with 
the house 
there was still a chance of sending the bill directly to reagan 
but only if all amendments offered were defeated 
farm belt senators attempting to strip from the bill or at least 
weaken a provision that would increase dutyfree imports of 
caribbean ethanol ethyl alcohol that is mixed with gasoline to 
form the fuel gasahol ethanol is made from farm products and us 
corn growers are anxious to block further imports 
besides giving the administration authority to reach agreements 
on modifying the general agreement on tariffs and trade the major 
pact that regulates world commerce the bill would streamline 
mechanisms for imposing import curbs to protect us industries and 
retaliate against trade violations by other countries 
other provisions range from a potential 2 billion in 
agricultural subsidies to repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil 
industry earnings 
the bill was largely stripped of protectionist provisions that 
drew fierce opposition from the administration and a broad 
coalition of free trade advocates in congress 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the finance committee 
and the democratic vice presidential nominee told reporters he 
would pursue a noamendments strategy to keep the bill out of a 
housesenate conference 
asked about reagans aboutface on the plantclosing notices 
bentsen replied i think he saw the polls and i think he also 
knew what was going to happen in the senate 
sen john c danforth rmo said he was glad to see the 
plantclosings controversy resolved 
i think that this issue has been a tar baby as far as 
republicans are concerned danforth said that was a political 
mistake most people in the country did not agree with the 
presidents position on plant closings and he finally reached the 
conclusion that this was not a winner and the time had come to get 
rid of the tar baby

nl industries inc has dropped consideration of a 
proposed merger with its majority shareholder valhi inc the 
holding company for investor harold simmons after failing to reach 
a merger agreement nl said tuesday 
nl industries board of directors plans meet aug 12 to review 
alternatives with respect to the separation of its chemicals and 
petroleum services operations and the redemption of its series c 
preferred stock the company said 
exactly what the alternatives are we really cant say said 
nl spokesman patrick m murray weve had some very preliminary 
discussions and well be working through that process in next two 
weeks 
valhi gained control of houstonbased nl a petroleum services 
and chemical company in a hostile takeover in 1986 it owns about 
52 percent of nls outstanding common shares and 67 percent of the 
class c shares 
valhi has offered to acquire nls series c preferred stock 
which represents the chemicals unit and was issued as a takeover 
defense in june 1986 while giving common shareholders cash and 
stock in a new company that would own the oilfield business 
nls three independent directors who retained the right to veto 
merger and acquisition plans following the hostile takeover have 
blocked valhis attempts to acquire the chemicals business 
the issue all along has been an issue of valuation and how the 
stock was valued said murray it was really an issue of our 
independent directors approving the proposal from valhi and they 
did not do that it was not whether we valued it higher or lower 
than valhi

washingtons insurance commissioner on 
tuesday rejected an unfriendly takeover of farmers insurance group 
by batus inc making his state the fourth to do so 
the policyholders could quite possibly lose from the 
acquisition and they do not stand to gain anything from it 
commissioner dick marquardt said in an order turning down the 
takeover proposal 
washington joins oregon idaho and california in rejecting the 
45 billion 63 per share hostile takeover bid arizona has 
approved the takeover and decisions are pending in illinois ohio 
kansas and texas 
ed ives a spokesman for marquardt said an appeal of the order 
was certain batus the us arm of british conglomerate bat 
industries plc has 30 days to appeal to the commissioner 
marquardts decision followed nearly a week of hearings in 
seattle last month as have regulators in other states he 
expressed concern that if it took over farmers there was a 
likelihood batus might drop the companys nonsmoker discounts on 
auto and homeowner policies 
louisville kybased batus is the parent of brown amp williamson 
tobacco corp 
the commissioner also said there was a chance batus would end 
farmers medical malpractice coverage 
farmers withdrawal from this market would have seriously 
adverse anticompetitive effects particularly in the washington 
market and would tend to create a monopoly in that line in 
washington he said 
farmers insurance co of washington based in vancouver and 
farmers new world life headquartered on mercer island are 
affiliates of farmers insurance group of los angeles 
farmers is the states largest auto insurance company writing 
174 percent of the market marquardt said it ranks third in 
homeowner policies 10th in commercial insurance sales and provides 
a quarter of all washington hospitals with their medical 
malpractice coverage
