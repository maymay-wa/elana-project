three robbers burst into a fastfood 
restaurant tied up the manager and attempted to flee with 
thousands of dollars but were cut down and killed in a fusillade 
of police gunfire monday authorities said 
a fourth person involved in the robbery at a mcdonalds 
restaurant was wounded said police lt fred nixon none of the 
victims was immediately identified but nixon said the survivor was 
in serious condition at a los angeles hospital 
nine officers from the police departments special 
investigations section watched the robbery taking place around 2 
am and approached the men after they got into a getaway car 
authorities said 
the officers opened fire when one of the four raised what looked 
like a handgun and pointed it at them said police lt bill hall 
who heads the team that investigates shootings involving police 
all officers fired almost simultaneously said hall 
the gun turned out to be a pellet gun but to police it looked 
real he said i dont think youd be likely to know the 
difference if you were looking down the barrel of one hall said 
officers recovered masks and several thousand dollars in cash 
from the car hall said 
police had been following the four some of whom were believed 
involved in earlier restaurant robberies said officer bill frio 
we had a couple of possible suspects identified but not 
enough evidence to arrest and book them so we were tailing them 
he said 
the four were followed from the beachfront community of venice 
to sun valley about 15 miles north of downtown where hall said 
officers watched them enter the closed restaurant 
there was a female manager inside alone and the doors were 
all locked said hall the suspects forced open a side door 
tied her up and forced her to provide the combination of the safe 
hall said the manager called police when she saw the men 
approaching her restaurant but it was decided to make the arrest 
afterward rather than interrupt the robbery because there had been 
no injuries in previous restaurant holdups

oh st valentine how to capture the rapture does confection 
affirm affection do flowers floor or will it take a gold mine to 
get you to be mine 
valentines day colored rose red punctuated with arrows from 
cupids bow sweet as a bon bon and pretty as a bouquet actually 
has its roots in blood gore guts and gluttony 
historians say valentines day began in the third century when 
two christian saints both named valentine were executed because 
the martyrs feast day feb 14 was around the time of a pagan 
roman festival called the lupercalia which celebrated fertility 
st valentine was popularly designated the patron saint of lovers 
its been 1720 years since the heathens had their way today 
we shower oursweeties with perfume jewelry lingerie candy and 
flowers 
well also buy them pajamas stuffed animals in all shapes 
acrylic legs filled with german chocolate at 98 a limb at macys 
and vietnamese potbellied pigs 
americans will give their valentines 611 million worth of candy 
this year about 250 in sweets for every man woman and child 
says richard oconnell president of the national confectioners 
association 
if that 611 million were translated into chocolate kisses at 
the new york city price of 5 a pound about 93 kisses it would 
buy 1222 million pounds if all those kisses were laid end to end 
the chain of chocolate would circle the globe 64 times 
if you dont want to make your baby a blimp merchants have a 
few suggestions 
bloomingdales has some really fun boxer shorts with hearts on 
them said spokeswoman jennifer conner they also have tshirts 
with big red lips on them the apparel will set you back about

victorias secret the mildly racy lingerie chain offers 
toiletries for those who dont feel their relationships are up to 
intimate underthings 
but business is still brisk in undies said spokeswoman laura 
holbrook oversized satin tshirts silk camisoles and pants in 
rich gem colors like emerald ruby sapphire will be big she 
said 
a little more upscale bergdorf goodman has red silk pajamas for

macys estate jewelry department offers atomizers with

always popular is the romantic staple a simple red rose 
seventy million roses will be sold for valentines day the biggest

predicts eighty percent will be red the rest mostly pink and 
yellow 
the other valentine tradition exchanging cards is booming 
said leslee parsons a spokeswoman for the american greeting corp 
they expect more than 1 billion valentines to be given this year 
school children give the most cards she said 
but back to the chocolate the national confectioners 
association says americans increasing health consciousness is 
actually boosting the industry 
americans are treating themselves to confections and sweets 
but because they are more health conscious and working out they 
dont feel as guilty said spokesman brian muloney in fact 
theres more working out and pigging out 
and there are some who will literally pig out 
paradise pigs which sells the latest trendy pet vietnamese 
potbellied pigs says it has received orders for valentines day 
pigs which cost from 1500 to 2500 for males and about 5000 
for females 
the pigs are prized because they stay small ranging from 25 
pounds to 150 pounds and have sunny dispositions 
for a lot of our customers its like having a kid said 
paradise pigs owner kris bryant husbands are buying them for 
their wives men are buying them for their girlfriends 
bryant said her pigs try to knock the phone from her hand when 
they think shes been talking long enough that might make them a 
good buy for parents of teenagers 
be it a dozen roses or a porcine bundle of joy most people will 
wonder about their valentines day gift was it given sincerely or 
was it just an obligatory gesture 
people spend a good deal of time wondering if a gift is 
sincere said sociologist hy mariampolski and givers also worry 
whether their presents will be enjoyed he said 
people are very insecure about gifts being appreciated so they 
fall into patterns of safe gift giving said mariampolski who 
studies giftgiving habits for qualidata research inc in new york 
one way to make sure your gift is wellregarded is to personalize 
it he said 
it may be a bouquet of flowers he said but if a guy has 
it delivered to his girlfriends doorstep by a strolling musician 
its going to be very special

in his first speech after 
leaving prison nelson mandela repeated the most famous section of 
his last previous speech his statement from the dock at the 1964 
rivonia trial 
it was a striking reminder of the importance of that trial 
which resulted in life prison sentences for the core of the african 
national congress leadership 
the trial took its name from the area near johannesburg where 
mandelas anc colleagues were arrested in a police raid on a 
farmhouse used as a secret headquarters for the guerrilla movement 
mandela already jailed for two years for his covert activities 
and 10 other men went on trial charged with sabotage and 
conspiring to overthrow the government they faced possible 
execution if convicted 
there was a very real fear of the death penalty arthur 
chaskalson one of the defense attorneys said in an interview 
not until the last day were we sure it wouldnt be imposed 
several of the defendants including mandela decided not to 
contest the sabotage charges they contended the ancs use of 
violence was a necessary last resort after the government rejected 
nonviolent protest campaigns 
despite these admissions the state summoned a parade of 
witnesses to bolster its case including guerrillasturnedinfomers 
identifed as mr x and mr y 
most witnesses lied shamelessly purposefully and apparently 
to order wrote joel joffe another defense lawyer in an 
unpublished account of the trial he said most of the witnesses 
were held for long periods in solitary confinement and subjected to 
duress 
presiding in the highceilinged main chamber of pretoria supreme 
court was justice quartus de wet described by joffe as 
politically independent but arrogant prejudiced tempermental 
he was unquestionably sensitive to the needs of the white 
society which he believed in and upheld and also of the 
government he acted out their role i think unconsciously 
joffe wrote 
joffe later moved to britain where he became a businessman and 
a trustee of oxfam a private relief agency chaskalson and george 
bizos another member of the defense team are among south africas 
most prominent civil rights lawyers 
the head of their team bram fischer was arrested in september 
1964 five months after the trial ended on charges of membership 
in the outlawed communist party he went underground while on bail 
was caught in november 1965 and sentenced to life imprisonment 
stricken with cancer he was allowed to move to a brothers home 
under house arrest and died soon afterwards in may 1975 
chaskalson said prison authorities took fischers ashes after he 
was cremated and never returned them to relatives 
the prosecuter was percy yutar described by joffe as fond of 
bogus hysteria and fake dramatics 
yutar is still a practicing lawyer but he refused to comment on 
the trial or mandelas release 
im not a politician im a legal man yutar said i dont 
discuss cases i have prosecuted 
during the trial yutar scoffed at the ancs assertion that it 
represented the wishes of the black majority 
the deceit of the accused is amazing they took it on 
themselves to tell the world that the africans in south africa are 
suppressed oppressed and depressed yutar said it is a great 
pity that the rank and file of the bantu blacks in the country 
who are peaceful lawabiding faithful and loyal should have been 
duped by false promises 
on april 20 1964 mandela entered the dock to explain why the 
anc took up arms in pursuit of freedom on sunday before tens of 
thousands of supporters in cape town mandela ended the first 
speech of his newfound freedom with the same words he used to 
conclude in pretoria 
during my lifetime i have dedicated myself to this struggle 
of the african people i have fought against white domination and i 
have fought against black domination he said 
i have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in 
which all persons live together in harmony and with equal 
opportunities it is an ideal which i hope to live for and achieve 
but my lord if needs be an ideal for which i am prepared to 
die 
during the fivehour statement recalled joffe the silence 
became more and more profound until it seemed that no one in the 
court dared move or breathe 
on june 12 1964 mandela and seven codefendants were sentenced 
by de wet to life in prison he said sparing them from the gallows 
was the only leniency he could show 
the defense lawyers who had become close friends with the 
accused felt both sadness and satisfaction 
wed done all we could said chaskalson these were the 
leaders of the apartheid resistance they conducted themselves with 
tremendous dignity they stated their cases so well about why 
they went into revolt against the state 
the only white man among those convicted dennis goldberg was 
freed in 1985 after he agreed to renounce violence the others 
except for mandela were freed unconditionally last october 
de wet is dead as are prime minister hendrik verwoerd and 
justice minister bj voster who oversaw the police attempt to 
smash the anc all the convicted defendants are alive the oldest 
being 80yearold govan mbeki 
could it be said that in some way the defendants won the case 
chaskalson was asked 
they certainly didnt lose he replied they had the moral 
high ground

the identity of the first st valentine is about as mysterious 
as love itself 
historians say valentines day has its origins in the third 
century when two christian martyrs both named valentine were 
executed a pagan festival to fertility called the lupercalia was 
still being celebrated at that time and because it fell around the 
martyrs feb 14 feast day st valentine became the protector of 
lovers 
the people of terni italy a steelmaking town between rome and 
perugia insist their st valentine was the one who started the 
annual day of love the towns patron saint was beheaded feb 14 in 
the year 270 after having been imprisoned and whipped 
legend has it that valentine had a garden where he let children 
play and lovers meet while imprisoned valentine tied the keys of 
the garden gate to two pigeons with a message inviting the children 
to return to the garden 
a version of the terni story has valentine in his 76 years as 
bishop giving lovers flowers from the garden one couple who 
encountered the bishop enjoyed such a happy marriage that every 
couple wanted his blessing 
the story is complicated by a second st valentine also 
beheaded in the third century in rome and who also has a feast 
day feb 14 
but valentine 2 may not have been a saint at all some 
scholars say a church built on romes via flaminia by a man named 
valentine somehow became known as st valentines church starting 
a legend about a nonexistent saint 
the roman catholic church takes a neutral stance and designates 
no patron saint of lovers the vatican congregation for the causes 
of saints says 17 valentines are listed in the official 
encyclopedia of saints including ones from italy france spain 
and germany 
ternis bishop franco gualdrini also refuses to claim his 
towns saint as the definitive champion of love 
it is a popular tradition gualdrini once said of the 
adulation st valentine now receives some things are proclaimed 
from above some are proclaimed from below

when nelson mandela walks the 
streets of johannesburg after 27 years in prison he will see signs 
of dramatic change in the apartheid system he will also see stark 
reminders of what has not changed 
mandela will see blacks in jobs and areas where they would have 
been banned a few years ago by apartheid laws enforcing segregation 
of the countrys races but he will still be banned from living in 
white areas his grandchildren will be banned from white schools 
and he and his family will still be registered as blacks with no 
political rights 
the black majority three quarters of the population still 
has no parliamentary vote and pretoria shows no sign of getting rid 
of its ideological cornerstones the sowetan newspaper commented 
apartheid the legal segregation of south africas whites 
blacks asians and mixedrace people still survives in many forms 
despite efforts by president fw de klerks to ease the system 
the government says it has no immediate plans to abolish apartheid 
laws segregating residential areas and classifying people by race 
mandela said after leaving prison sunday that south africa could 
never have peace until all vestiges of apartheid were destroyed 
apartheids destruction on our subcontinent is incalculable the 
fabric of family life of millions of my people has been 
shattered he said 
de klerk freed mandela on feb 11 after legalizing the african 
national congress and other antiapartheid groups to try and clear 
the way for talks with the black majority on ending white rule and 
sharing political power 
johannesburg and other big cities have seen major changes in 
recent years as some apartheid laws have been repealed or are just 
ignored central areas of johannesburg once dominated by whites 
are increasingly black and restaurants shops cinemas and other 
facilites are open to all races 
many aspects of socalled petty apartheid such as separate 
public toilets park benches and segregated restaurants have 
disappeared some major apartheid laws have been abolished 
including regulations requiring blacks to have passes to enter 
white areas and racial restrictions on jobs 
also gone are morality laws that imposed prison sentences on 
people of different races who married or had sex it is a striking 
change from the days when all blacks were expected to address 
whites as boss 
but the changes in johannesburg and other relatively liberal 
cities have not been matched in many smaller towns and rural 
districts where many people live many blacks living around victor 
verster prison outside cape town where mandela was held still call 
whites master or boss 
when mandela was jailed in 1962 the apartheid system segregating 
whites and blacks was approaching its peak the white government 
said blacks could never be more than laborers and the racial 
superiority of whites was the de facto creed of the country 
hendrik verwoerd a former prime minister who did much to design 
and build apartheid said during a 1954 senate debate on black 
education there is no place for him blacks above the level of 
certain forms of labor what is the use of teaching a bantu 
black child mathematics when it cannot use it in practice 
hundreds of thousands of blacks were forcibly relocated from 
towns or good farmland to barren country areas to make room for 
whites 
a typical schoolbook for white children taught that blacks were 
inferior the white stands on a much higher plane of civilization 
and is more developed whites must so live learn and work that we 
shall not sink to the cultural level of the nonwhite it said 
while de klerk says he is committed to ending whiteminority 
rule he says it must not be replaced by black domination the 
government has indicated it wants group rights or special 
status for whites in any deal with blacks 
mandela and other black leaders say only equal rights can ensure 
the rights of all south africans and group rights would just be 
another form of apartheid 
today the majority of south africans black and white 
recognize that apartheid has no future it has to be ended by our 
own decisive mass action in order to build peace and security he 
said

the fall of hardline communist 
governments across eastern europe will deprive the plo and other 
arab groups of weapons and training 
until recently romania czechoslovakia east germany and poland 
provided varying degrees of material and political support to the 
plo and other groups the aid has now been halted or reduced 
these countries provided training weapons served as host 
facilities for terrorist organizations and sometimes provided 
sabotage materials said mark heller an analyst at tel aviv 
universitys jaffee center for strategic studies in israel 
i wouldnt be surprised if that activity stopped completely 
he added 
poland under the new government of premier tadeusz mazowiecki 
last year withdrew a small stipend it gave to the plos diplomatic 
mission in warsaw 
czechoslovakia used to export 540 million worth of arms a year 
some of it to the middle east but will halt all weapons exports 
when present agreements expire foreign minister jiri dienstbier 
says 
polish officials say warsaw intends to treat every arab country 
equally and that ideology has been eliminated as a factor in polish 
foreign relations 
krzysztof plominski the foreign ministrys deputy department 
director for arab and african affairs last month said poland 
opposes any form of terrorism 
us government sources reported in early 1988 that the 
terrorist abu nidal had used a warsaw trading office as a front for 
his organization the office was closed apparently at request of 
the polish government 
czechoslovak and romanian officials deny any aid to arab 
radicals since their revolutions 
yes there was military and training support to what you can 
call libyan terrorists but all of that has been suspended today 
a czechoslovak foreign ministry official told the associated press 
he spoke on condition his name not be used 
czechoslovak officials said training camps for hundreds of 
libyans and other arab radicals existed in at least one interior 
ministry school near kladno 20 miles west of prague they said it 
is now closed 
according to the israeli government press office east germany 
also provided training to plo guerrillas some of it was at the 
friedrich engels academy in dresden 
in addition to helping radicals fight czechoslovakia and other 
countries often supplied material help to mideast and north african 
countries 
at least 1 billion worth of czechoslovak machinery and 
construction projects were provided to arab countries according to 
official figures in prague 
romania which from the late 1970s trained hundreds of plo 
guerrillas at bases in the black sea port of constanta the 
southern town of calarasi and near bucharest said in january it 
had abrogated agreements concluded by toppled communist dictator 
nicolae ceausescu 
the foreign ministry said without further detail it discovered 
secret agreements that violated international law 
romanias former counterintelligence chief gen ion pacepa 
who defected to the united states in 1978 said in his book red 
horizons that bucharest gave the plo arms and hundreds of forged 
passports 
romania east germany and czechoslovakia all maintained cordial 
relations with plo leader yasser arafat and regularly hosted him as 
a guest of state in 1988 the plo offices in those countries were 
elevated to the status of embassies 
as an indication of how things are changing czechoslovakia 
resumed diplomatic relations with israel last week and east germany 
is considering reparations to jews who suffered in the holocaust of 
world war ii 
west german officials suspect the former east german leadership 
allowed arab terrorists to cross into west berlin 
in april 1986 when two us soldiers and a turkish woman were 
killed and 230 people injured in the bombing of a west berlin 
discotheque west german and us officials said they believed the 
attack was planned and executed by the libyan embassy in east 
berlin 
other terrorists acts carried out from east berlin by arabs 
included the bombing of the german arab friendship society in west 
berlins kreuzberg district in march 1986 believed to have been 
organized by a syrian

seated in a johannesburg television studio a few 
feet from an african national congress leader foreign minister pik 
botha of south africa described followers of the black guerrilla 
movement as my friends 
the ancs ahmed kathrada released a year ago after 26 years in 
jail said nothing really had changed but that he didnt doubt the 
sincerity or integrity of the white government leaders 
his face lined and somber jeff masomola of the smaller 
militant black nationalist pan african congress dismissed 
negotiations as futile 
only immediate universal suffrage for the 51 black majority he 
said will result in the taking over of this country by the 
people who own it 
veteran white liberal politician helen suzman chided botha for 
making the sort of speeches i made 30 years ago 
all were guests on the british broadcasting corps panorama 
current affairs program beamed live from johannesburg in what the 
network said was the first such appearance by south african leaders 
from across almost the entire political spectrum 
only the farright white opposition conservative party refused 
to come to the studio because its followers object to sitting in a 
room with anc members 
conservative party spokesman koos van der merwe made his 
contribution in a separate recording he nelson mandela came 
out of that jail on sunday without having given in one inch of 
his demands said van der merwe they are not interested in 
peace or democracy they want complete capitulation of the white 
people 
no one raised their voices or interrupted throughout monday 
nights nearly onehour program 
apart from two giant drawings of anc leader nelson mandela in 
the background the atmosphere resembled that of a leisurely late 
night talk show about the modern novel 
in the studio audience several whites expressed unease or 
resentment about the insistence by mandela released on sunday 
after 27 years in jail that the armed struggle should continue 
some of the blacks wondered why after decades of apartheid blacks 
were now supposed to help allay white fears 
but a black businessman suggested blacks and whites should each 
imagine how it felt to be the other at this momentous time in their 
countrys history 
a white student seated alongside a young black woman with the 
anc colors pinned on her school uniform said he was confident of a 
future where race no longer mattered 
chief mangosotho buthelezi leader of south africas largest 
tribe and its inkhata movement was equally confident that once 
round a negotiating table south africans would find a way 
blacks and whites in this country have become 
interdependent said buthelezi who rejects anc violence but 
refuses to take independece for his fragmented kwazulu homeland 
under apartheids now abandoned grand plan of giving the white 
minority permanent control 
challenged by van der merwe from offstage to say whether the 
government was prepared to yield to anc demands of universal 
suffrage in a unitary state botha looked weary 
my government has insisted that whatever constitution is 
agreed upon must have majority support said botha how we are 
going to do it will be for the various parties to decide 
he paused and added with all respect to my friends in the 
anc if they think for one moment that some of their policies are 
going to be accepted by a majority of south africans including 
black south africans i say to them they are going to be in for a 
surprise

waves of grimy crude oil spilled 
by a tanker invaded a twomile stretch of southern california beach 
monday near a refuge for endangered pelicans and other birds 
authorities closed about 10 miles of popular surfing and 
sunbathing beaches to the public for at least three weeks because 
of the health threat posed by fumes from the oil 
cleanup crews dispatched to the fouled bolsa chica state beach 
discovered what authorities called the most serious beach pollution 
since the spill of an estimated 400000 gallons wednesday the 
tanker american trader apparently punctured itself twice on its own 
anchor as it maneuvered near a submerged pipeline about two miles 
offshore 
we got hit with more oil overnight than we have in this whole 
process said tony kozlowski spokesman for cleanup coordinator 
british petroleum co plc which chartered the tanker american 
trader 
it was an unbelievable sight huntington beach mayor tom 
mays said after a helicopter tour we got hit pretty bad last 
night and its continuing today 
black waves glistening in the sun crashed to shore despite the 
efforts of a flotilla of boats working to trap the encroaching goo 
with containment booms 
the oily onslaught is near the inland bolsa chica wetlands an 
ecological reserve that is home to the endangered california brown 
pelican as well as a temporary home to thousands of migratory birds 
and much marine life 
at bolsa chica 20 miles south of downtown los angeles the 
slick ran along two miles of beach about 30 feet wide and 2 inches 
deep 
smaller ribbons of oil 4 feet wide were reported near the 
huntington beach pier about 5 miles to the south the coast guard 
said 
cleanup crews worked along a 20mile stretch of beach from bolsa 
chica south to laguna beach 
the cleanup at bolsa chica was suspended briefly when workers 
began complaining of headaches and nausea from the oily fumes but 
by midday more than 400 cleanup workers were on the beach 
kozlowski said 
there is no oil in the estuary said patrick moore of the 
state department of fish and game but birds are leaving the 
wetlands and going to the ocean and bringing the oil back to the 
estuary 
seventyone dead birds grebes gulls loons and pelicans 
have been found in the area and another 222 oilsoaked birds were 
rescued alive and taken to a treatment center moore said 
on monday evening the 811foot american tanker dropped anchor 
just inside the long beach harbor breakwater after receiving coast 
guard permission to do so the move had been delayed until the ship 
was declared clean enough to enter the harbor 
scuba divers applied temporary patches to two holes in the 
punctured hull sunday and authorities said the vessel passed 
watertight integrity tests 
onethird of the estimated 400000 gallons of alaskan crude 
still menaced the coast the coast guard said skimmers picked up 
23 percent of the spill and 43 percent evaporated or naturally 
dissipated 
city and state beaches from anaheim bay south through in 
huntington beach about 10 miles in all were closed for an 
indefinite period with a threeweek minimum authorities cited the 
danger of fumes from the oil 
it is of vital importance to keep people off the beaches the 
contaminated birds are frightened by the crowds on the beach and 
will not come ashore where they can be safely rescued said 
biologist esther burkett of fish and game 
us sen alan cranston dcalif viewed the beaches from a 
helicopter then criticized president bush for telling a news 
conference monday that the spill shouldnt be used to bolster 
arguments against offshore oil drilling bush said a tanker 
accident wasnt an indictment of drilling platform safety 
the president should read the environmental impact statements 
by his own department of the interior which point out that the 
more drilling platforms that you have the more tankers you will 
need said cranston 
on the beach politicians environmentalists and celebrities 
gathered to demand legislation at the federal and state levels 
requiring double hulls for tankers and other safeguards 
it makes no difference what the damn cost is actor james 
garner said of the expense of doublehulled tankers what matters 
is the environment the money doesnt mean anything the 
environment does 
congress is considering laws requiring doublehulled tankers on 
the state level california attorney general john van de kamp 
endorsed an initiative calling for a cleanup superfund

king henry viiis love letters to anne boleyn 
eight years before he ordered her beheaded are part of a display 
of royal valentines that show the soppy side of britains rulers 
mine own sweetheart these shall be to advertise you of the 
great aloneness that i find here since your departing said 
henrys letter signed hr and dated 1528 the r stands for rex 
latin for king 
the impulsive kings testaments of ardor are among 100 
transcribed documents on view that span more than 450 years 
some of the letters are steamy some heartfelt and many dispel 
historical cliches said michele brown curator of the valentine 
display which is part of the royal britain exhibition at londons 
barbican center 
king edward vii who reigned from 19011910 was known as 
edward the caresser for his involvement with mistresses 
including actress lillie langtry ms brown said 
while youd expect him to be the great wooer with words and 
his letters an absolute hotbed of passion and love all he talks 
about is the weather she said 
however his mother and father queen victoria and prince 
albert exchanged letters that contradict the sometimes icy image 
of the couple the curator said 
the textbook view is that victoria was absolutely besotted by 
albert and he was a cold fish and laid back and thought about 
england all of the time but the letters are very revealing ms 
brown said 
albert wrote to victoria just before they were married in 1840 
dearest best beloved victoria already another dear dear 
letter from you which has wholly charmed me for it once again 
tells me you love me and proves that you love me truly and 
faithfully do you remember how i warmed your dear little hands 
every day in the lovely little blue room in quiet hours i live on 
such memories good dear charming victoria in my thoughts i am 
very much with you 
the most recent letters in the exhibition are those of king 
edward viii who abdicated the throne in 1936 to marry american 
divorcee wallis warfield simpson 
addressing her as my own darling peaches edward wrote 
before they married god i love you my wallis my beloved 
sweetheart more and more and more im holding so tight all the 
time until that dear lovely precious day oh god make it come 
quickly and bless we wallis and edward this year and always 
the letters were published after the duchess of windsor died in 
1986 because she wanted to correct the impression that she had 
lured the king from his throne 
the copies were made from love letters found in the public 
record office the royal collection and other repositories ms 
brown said 
the letters from henry viii to anne boleyn are in the vatican 
library because they were relevant to his divorce which led to the 
split of the roman catholic church and the church of england ms 
brown explained 
ms brown said she believes todays royals are unlikely to leave 
behind many interesting love letters 
the letters on display are all wellthought out and 
composed theyre not the odd bashed out note she said im 
afraid the telephone has taken over now and there are very few love 
letters

president bush says he will await the expected 
visit of south african president f w de klerk before deciding 
whether to respond to the release of nelson mandela by improving 
relations with that country 
bush is barred by law from lifting us sanctions against south 
africa until specific reforms are adopted and there is strong 
support in congress for keeping the sanctions in place as a lever 
to encourage additional dismantling of white supremacist rule 
the sanctions impose severe restrictions on american investment 
in south africa and purchases of the countrys exports the 
congressional black caucus issued a statement monday saying any 
talk of lifting the sanctions is premature 
but there are other overtures the administration could make 
toward south africa in recognition of de klerks fresh approach 
toward the countrys black majority 
the united states could make some gestures to ease south 
africas international isolation by dispatching a highlevel 
emissary to pretoria or by engaging in efforts to ease united 
nations restrictions on dealing with that country 
although bush seemed in no hurry to act on any options there 
was little doubt mandelas release and other gestures improved the 
atmosphere considerably between washington and pretoria 
bush alluded to the warming on monday when he called mandelas 
release after 27 years in prison another important sign that 
south africa may soon begin negotiating a democratic nonracial 
society and at last be on the way to ending apartheid once and for 
all 
the state department said it was heartened by the moderate tone 
of mandelas remarks since his release on sunday 
we found noteworthy his expression of hope that a climate 
conducive to a negotiated settlement would be created soon so that 
there may no longer be the need for armed struggle it said 
official contacts between the two countries dropped off sharply 
after the sanctions were imposed by congress in 1986 over 
thenpresident reagans veto 
now de klerk is preparing to become the first south african 
president to visit the united states the administration issued 
separate invitations to de klerk and mandela to visit washington 
but no dates have been set 
bush told a news conference monday he wants to discuss the 
sanctions issue with both de klerk and mandela and said the two 
south africans also should negotiate 
and then out of that i think well have a much more realistic 
picture of what the united states might do in the future he said 
bush added that a white house visit by de klerk would be a 
major step in ussouth african relations but that more 
substantive action would not be appropriate until afterward 
bush said he finds some of the sanctions counterproductive and 
played down the suggestion that they had a key role in inducing 
south africa to signal moves toward a more equitable political 
system 
whats really changed is the mindset of the south african 
leadership bush said i think that we ought to give mr de 
klerk certain credit for being able to look much more realistically 
about political change and hopefully more favorably about a 
society that eventually eliminates this racism that is equated with 
apartheid 
as for the us sanctions the comprehensive antiapartheid act 
stipulated that before they could be lifted south africa had to 
free all political prisoners and meet at least three of four other 
conditions 
de klerk already has met one of the conditions by legalizing the 
african national congress and other antiapartheid groups 
but senate democratic leader george mitchell of maine said 
the essence of these conditions is the dismantling of the south 
african laws which are the foundation of their system of racial 
segregation 
no fundamental change has been made in that direction yet and 
such change must occur before we can consider lifting sanctions 
mitchell said in a statement 
other conditions include release of other political prisoners 
repeal of the state of emergency and freeing of all those detained 
under it repeal of laws which restrict where nonwhites can live 
and work and government agreement to enter goodfaith negotiations 
with representatives of the black majority

he is 32 an intense young man bent on 
political change dealing in the familiar fare of issues 
endorsements and voter opinion as he looks toward the 1990 
campaign men and women like him do the daily business of us 
politics as the executive directors of state democratic and 
republican parties 
while their tasks are comparable their challenges are not 
for arkadiy murashev is secretary to a fledgling opposition 
movement in the soviet union seeking to build a political party 
not just manage one 
murashev a moscow physicist come to political life when his 
scientist colleagues nominated him for the congress of peoples 
deputies told of the work and aims of his movement in sometimes 
halting english 
he was in washington in what might seem unlikely company on a 
10day visit sponsored by conservative political activists 
the free congress foundation and its president paul weyrich 
were his sponsors and guides at a series of sessions with 
conservative groups government officials and members of congress 
weyrich and six other conservative political tacticians went to 
eastern europe and to moscow last fall on a twoweek political 
training mission murashev was one of about 45 soviet participants 
the soviet political rules changed while he was in washington 
as leaders of the communist party agreed to relinquish its 
guarantee of monopoly power and to permit the creation of 
opposition parties 
we must move with the tide must move with the people and not 
be left behind by events said government spokesman gennadi 
gerasimov 
murashev said the changes adapted to reality this plenum 
declared the situation that already existed in the soviet union 
he told a group of conservative activists and congressmen and 
when we return for us its no change 
he is secretary of the interregional group an opposition 
umbrella group claiming ties with about 400 of the 2250 members of 
the congress of peoples deputies its leading figure is boris 
yeltsin the one member of the communist central committee who 
voted against mikhail s gorbachevs political reform plan because 
he contends it doesnt go far enough yeltsin wants an immediate 
change to a multiparty democratic system and a free market economy 
gorbachev has liberalized the soviet political system gradually 
over the past five years changes that permitted formation of the 
interregional group and other movements the congress of peoples 
deputies was created as part of the gorbachev reform movement it 
first met in 1989 the opposition has a foothold there about 10 
percent of its delegates are not members of the communist party 
that legislative body meets again late in the spring and is to 
consider the constitutional changes the communist leadership agreed 
to last wednesday 
strictly speaking the interregional group is not a political 
party theoretically they havent had other parties weyrich 
said but it has all the attributes of a party 
the group sponsors and supports candidates in soviet elections 
it has a platform and takes positions on issues it is organizing 
for regional elections late this winter and early in the spring 
balloting comparable to state legislative elections in the united 
states 
murashev won his seat in the congress of peoples deputies last 
year with 54 percent of the vote in a fourway race among the 
rivals he beat to win a fiveyear term was the district communist 
party secretary at the time murashev was a candidate for 
communist party membership a process that takes a year when he 
became eligible in december murashev said he declined membership 
i refused to be a communist after that 
by his account the competition in soviet elections so far has 
been dominated by personalities and their chosen issues tell me 
this candidate is he against yeltsin or with him murashev said 
voters would ask him he said people also look for lists of 
candidates favored by the interregional group they say if you 
give us the list of candidates we will be voting for them he 
said 
murashev thinks more formal party structures will follow soon 
beginning with the equivalent of a european social democratic 
party thats already happening in independenceminded lithuania 
latvia and estonia 
at first he said the fledgling opposition parties probably 
will cooperate going into competition with one another as the 
process matures 
for all the speed of reform so far that may take time the 
communist party may yield its constitutional dominance but it will 
still have the money the manpower the organization the knowhow 
all the components of political power it also has jobs patronage 
on a scale no american political boss could have imagined 
obstacles notwithstanding murashev told the conservatives that 
soviet political reform cannot be undone now the process in the 
soviet union has gone so far it has become irreversible he said

banks with growing portfolios of sour real 
estate loans need to do a better job a top federal regulator says 
over the last year examination activity has revealed a 
significant number of fundamental deficiencies and negative trends 
in national bank real estate lending which require immediate 
attention comptroller of the currency robert l clarke said in a 
strongly worded memorandum released monday 
the memo to board members and chief executive officers at 4200 
nationally charted banks singled out three areas for criticism 
first basic lending principles have been ignored or 
compromised to increase volume and achieve higher levels of 
interest and fee income clarke said in particular banks are 
not requiring borrowers to invest enough of their own money in real 
estate projects 
second too many banks have failed to obtain accurate 
independent and timely appraisals of the real estate projects to 
which they are lending 
and third some banks are engaging in practices that make it 
difficult to determine when a real estate project is going bad 
those include inflating the loan amount so borrowers can cover the 
interest payments in the early years of the loan and operating with 
incomplete or nonexistent foreclosure policies 
clarkes warning follows earlier reports of a big increase in 
real estate problems in new england and arizona on top of existing 
problems in the oilproducing states of texas oklahoma and 
louisiana 
the level of sour real estate loans at national banks in new 
england hit 2 billion at the end of september representing 6 
percent of their real estate portfolio quadruple the default rate 
of two years ago 
in arizona national banks listed 825 million in bad real 
estate loans 20 percent of the total 
bank of new england corp the regions secondlargest bank 
holding company alone reported a 105 billion loss in 1989 
raising questions among analysts about whether it can survive 
bank management should initiate corrective action promptly 
clarke said examiners have been and will continue to be 
aggressive and have been instructed to recommend formal 
enforcement actions as appropriate 
the gettough policy of his examiners has prompted complaints 
from builders and others in new england that reliable and solvent 
borrowers were being denied credit 
clarke said nothing in the memo is intended to discourage 
sound real estate lending and that the vast majority of 
national banks have not deviated from traditional high lending 
standards

the aflcio is likely to continue a decade of 
dodging the abortion issue even though some elements of the labor 
federation want to adopt a prochoice stand at next weeks winter 
meeting in florida 
we have enough to say grace over without taking on the 
abortion issue said duke mcvey president of the missouri state 
labor council aflcio 
still behindthescenes maneuvering on whether the 141 million 
member federation should support legalized abortion or sit the 
issue out is expected to dominate much of the executive council 
meeting in bal harbour where the aflcios 33member board gathers 
each february 
prochoice union officials fear the council which has 
sidestepped a stand for more than a decade will ultimately stay 
neutral 
the majority of them are male theyre not children theyre 
getting up there in years and are kind of fixed in their attitudes 
they may not want to bite on this said jay foreman executive 
vice president of the united food and commercial workers 
international union the question is whether they want to take 
any risks 
foreman and other prochoice labor leaders think the issue has 
workplace ramifications because it affects the economic wellbeing 
of working women and raises questions of health care coverage and 
the ability of health care workers to do their job 
but other union officials including mcvey say abortion has 
nothing to do with 40 hours a week or 20 bucks an hour 
it splits our members and it doesnt address wages hours or 
conditions of employment mcvey said 
a number of rankandfile union members feel very strongly 
about the issue they dont support their union doing that kind of 
activity and they dont want to pay dues to a union that does 
mcvey said 
yet several prochoice union leaders noted the aflcio 
historically has gotten involved in issues not directly related to 
collective bargaining such as civil rights and school busing 
prochoice union officials trying to counter a national right 
to life letterwriting campaign that asks the aflcio to refuse to 
take a stand are pressing for adoption of a prochoice resolution 
that would put the federation in line with the stance taken by 
many of its political allies such as the democratic party and 
various womens and civil rights groups 
at a convention last fall of delegates from all 90 aflcio 
unions the delegates declined to adopt any of the half dozen 
prochoice resolutions submitted and instead referred them to the 
executive council 
there is no organized move afoot for the federation to condemn 
abortion 
william wynn president of the united food and commercial 
workers international union and a prochoice member of the council 
chairs the committee that will determine whether the federation 
should take a position 
wynn predicted the committee will be able to come to a 
definitive conclusion that will be responsive to everybodys 
feelings everybodys emotions i tend to believe we have the 
intelligence to do that 
he said the panel might be able to adopt a prochoice position 
as long as it agreed on language acknowledging moral and religious 
concerns but if the panel fails to recommend a prochoice 
position it would likely draft a statement explaining why the 
federation should stay away from the issue he said 
sponsors of last falls prochoice resolutions urged the council 
to act by the february meeting that would have allowed labor to 
use the decision as it begins making early decisions on 1990 
political candidates 
but even the strongest prochoice officials said abortion would 
not serve as a litmus test for candidates 
its not critical to the election cycle were not a 
singleissue group foreman said antiabortion candidates who 
were with us in every other way could still win labors 
endorsement he said 
the labor movement has longstanding ties to the roman catholic 
church and some opponents of last falls prochoice resolutions 
said that taking such a stand could hurt union organizing among 
bluecollar catholics

no doubt a debt to society had to be paid but 45 years is 
unreasonable falwell said sunday night before preaching at 
calvary church 
us district judge robert potter sentenced bakker in october 
for defrauding followers who had sent him 158 million in exchange 
for lodging guarantees at ptls heritage usa christian retreat in 
nearby fort mill sc 
falwell took over at ptl following bakkers march 1987 
resignation in a sex and money scandal involving former church 
secretary jessica hahn falwell resigned six months later after 
bakker announced he wanted to return to the ministry 
i think everybody here including the court just got caught

illinois residents who entered a 
legislators there ought to be a law contest say they want more 
public toilets lower taxes a change in election scheduling and no 
kissing in cars 
state rep larry wennlund said monday that 500 such ideas have 
arrived at his new lenox office in response to the contest he calls 
an experiment in real grassroots democracy 
eileen bludeau of oak park suggested election days be scheduled 
on sundays so more people could vote and ch west of northbrook 
said there ought to be a law against talking on car phones while 
driving 
people have good ideas good practical ideas said 
wennlund whose northern illinois district includes some of 
chicagos southern suburbs this is just a way to get those ideas 
to somebody who can do something about them 
the republican legislator advertised the contest last month 
asking entrants to tell him in 100 words or less what laws the 
state should pass 
the contest closed jan 31 and a winner will be announced in two 
weeks with judging based on the practicality and the worthiness 
of the idea he said 
wennlund said the winners chosen from adult and student 
categories will get a trip to the capitol in springfield next 
month theyll be invited to spend a day on the floor of the house 
of representatives with wennlund and watch their proposal be 
introduced as legislation 
the largest number of entries dealt with ideas for lower 
property taxes and most of those were from the elderly wennlund 
said 
another popular suggestion making up about 10 percent of the 
entries was for a recycling bill charging deposits for returnable 
bottles 
and then there were these suggestions 
there ought to be a law that citizens use their common sense 
thank you said eileen slater 70 of chicago 
there ought to be a law that every business serving the public 
be required to provide a public bathroom one entrant said adding 
the argument that when you have to go you have to go 
from the second grade at lincoln elementary school in a monmouth 
came no drinking in illinois no drugs no kissing in cars 
and from the somewhat more mature set at the school the third 
graders there was no naked movies on tv no playboy channel in 
illinois and no school for 300 years

the national milk producers federation says 
the administrations dairy plan in the 1990 farm bill could result 
in greater price instability for producers and consumers 
the bush proposal would continue the agriculture departments 
current basic milk price support formula but also seeks more 
flexibility in adjusting supports in line with market conditions 
this plan would only create more instability in the dairy 
industry with wilder swings in consumer prices and the loss of 
dairy farmers throughout the country said tom camerlo president 
of the national milk producers federation 
camerlo said in the federations newsletter that the plan 
amounts to even more and deeper price cuts for dairy farmers 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter unveiled the 
administrations farm bill proposals last week 
dairy price supports are carried out indirectly through usda 
purchases of surplus manufactured dairy products butter cheese 
and nonfat dry milk so that prices paid to farmers by dealers 
can be maintained at or above specified support levels 
the current program authorized by the 1985 farm law allows milk 
price supports to be raised or lowered according to market 
conditions when usda purchases are above or below designated 
trigger levels 
as it is now if usda estimates annual dairy purchases at 25 
billion pounds of milk equivalent or less the basic price support 
rate must be raised by 50 cents per 100 pounds on jan 1 
but if annual purchases are expected to exceed 5 billion pounds 
the support prices is lowered 50 cents no change is made if 
purchases are between 25 billion and 5 billion pounds of milk 
equivalent 
government surplus purchases have fallen from 123 billion 
pounds milk equivalent milkfat basis in fiscal 1986 to a 
projected 8 billion pounds in fiscal 1990 the proposal said 
meanwhile inventories of governmentowned dairy surpluses have 
declined to less than half of what they were in 1986 and the 
annual cost of the dairy support program has dropped from 23 
billion in 1986 to a projected 500 million in the 1990 fiscal year 
under the bush proposal annual adjustments could be made in 
increments of 25 to 50 cents per 100 pounds of milk instead of the 
flat 50cent increase or decrease 
and it would allow stiffer reductions if usda purchases rose 
above 75 billion pounds of milk equivalent including cuts of 50 
to 75 cents between 75 billion and 10 billion pounds and 1 for 
purchases over 10 billion pounds 
currently including a 50cent cut on jan 1 the basic milk 
support is 1010 per 100 pounds 
according to a projection developed by national milk producers 
federation economists the administrations proposal could result 
in backtoback 1 price support cuts in 1990 and 1991 
these cuts would drop the dairy support price to 810 per 
hundredweight in less than two years the federation said

a newly discovered march by john philip 
sousa written two years before his death and featuring a drum 
cadence that recalls his famous semper fidelis will have its 
american premiere friday at yale 
the work was discovered among the bandmasters possessions at 
the library of congress in washington by a sousa researcher loras 
schissel who completed the nearly finished piece with the sousa 
familys permission 
sousa who died in 1932 wrote about 130 marches his most 
famous works include semper fidelis 1888 washington post 
1889 and stars and stripes forever 1897 
the untitled march which will be performed by the 70member 
yale concert band at the end of an evening program has all the 
parts of a sousa march youd expect said thomas duffy director 
of the university bands 
keith brion of hamden a freelance symphony conductor who 
specializes in sousa concerts and who prepared a performance 
edition of the march for the yale band said monday he believes the 
newly found work is one of sousas better marches although the 
jury is not in 
the 3minute march also will be played by the yale band at 
carnegie hall in new york city on feb 27 
on first hearing the march sounds closest to sousas marine 
march said duffy 
but the work has more modern harmonies than sousas earlier 
works duffy and brion said 
all but a couple of measures were completed by sousa so the 
work that will be played is in no sense a reconstruction duffy 
said 
brion conducted the world premiere in october in stockholm with 
the stockholm symphonic wind orchestra the performance was carried 
on national television 
the march is being performed at yale in memory of john philip 
sousa iii the composers grandson who died last month 
yale was seeking the grandsons permission to perform the work 
when the school found out he had died duffy said the band 
subsequently was granted the right to play the piece by sousas 
greatgrandson john philip sousa iv who lives in los angeles 
the bandmaster who became known as the march king was the 
leader of the us marine corps band from 1880 to 1892 he left 
that position to form his own band which gained wide popularity 
the music has remained popular because sousa had an inspired 
gift for melody and rhythm brion said

the us food and drug administration 
approved for lastresort use the artificial heart developed by dr 
robert jarvik modifying a decision made last month the university 
of arizona said monday 
the fda last month withdrew its approval of the device both as a 
permanent implant and as a temporary bridge to transplantation 
saying there were serious deficiencies with its manufacture 
the agency also withdrew its approval of the acute ventricular 
assist device which helps the natural heart pump 
the artificial heart was initially called the jarvik7 but 
jarvik no longer is associated with symbion inc of tempe ariz 
which markets the product as the symbion7 symbion also markets 
the second device 
university medical center said in a statement monday that the 
fda now would not object to the devices being used as a last resort 
if all other approved alterntative treatments have failed or were 
deemed inappropriate and when no other lifesaving device is 
available to save a patients life 
in response to last months decision dr jack g copeland 
director of the medical centers artificial heart and transplant 
programs said he might go ahead and use the devices if the need 
arose the effect of their withdrawal would be to deprive 
potentially hundreds of critically ill patients of a chance for 
life copeland said 
the president and chief executive officer of symbion richard w 
alder confirmed monday night that the fda had mofidied its earlier 
decision and would permit lastresort livesaving uses under 
certain very prescribed conditions 
the change was outlined in a letter the agency sent fairly 
recently to organizations including the medical center which had 
been using the devices on an investigative basis he said 
alder said symbion and fda officials were arranging meetings to 
try to resolve issues remaining from last months decision 
we are pleased that the fda has recognized the value of the 
devices as a last resort for critically ill patients the use of 
this equipment is vital to save lives copeland said monday 
copeland said he had called fda officials as an individual 
physician after its initial letter and told them now were in 
limbo again every time we put this device in somebodys gonna say 
that were defying the fda and we know scientifically that theyre 
good devices 
i felt that it was an untenable position they were putting us 
into copeland added he said fda officials told him they 
thought i had a point 
copeland said he is certain the agency also must have been 
contacted by other surgeons 
he said the fda officials are reasonable people i think they 
came up with a reasonable decision

federal officials thought they had found a way 
to help evaluate the effectiveness of a new law extending 
transitional medicaid and childcare benefits to some public 
assistance recipients who get jobs 
but to compare the effects of the new benefits with the old 
they would have to deny the new benefits to some people 
thats how the department of health and human services came to 
approve the texas welfare reform demonstration project according 
to hhs officials 
this gave us an opportunity to have something to contribute to 
our knowledge said mike fishman acting deputy of income 
security policy at hhs 
but hhs secretary louis sullivan on monday night ordered the 
pilot project revised 
no person receiving welfare in the state of texas has been 
denied or will be denied benefits to which they are entitled under 
federal law he said 
the initial version of the project actually began last july 
providing 12 months of extended medicaid and child care benefits to 
most of the 8000 participants who got jobs or entered training 
programs 
but 800 of the participants were eligible only for the four 
months of extended transitional benefits available to all other 
recipients of aid to families with dependent children and medicaid 
who are not in a pilot program 
the purpose of the study was to see whether the added benefits 
helped keep people off the welfare rolls officials wanted to see 
whether extended benefits encouraged people to take and remain in 
entrylevel jobs that are unlikely to offer medical insurance or 
child care benefits immediately 
this kind of experiment has long been used in science medicine 
and industry as a tool of evaluation and has been used for more 
than 20 years in social research to measure the effectiveness of 
social policies 
and like other most other social experiments the government has 
allowed it was set up so that the experimental group was 
getting added benefits while the control group got only the 
level of benefits already offered 
however the project had been designed before congress passed a 
bill giving all people on afdc and medicaid 12 months of extended 
transitional benefits beginning april 1 of this year 
thus if the texas pilot project had continued beyond april 1 
that would have meant the 800 people now in the control group 
would continue to get only four months benefits even though 
starting april 1 federal law would entitle them to 12 months 
hhs officials suggested to texas officials that they propose 
continuing the program texas did and hhs approved it in the 
interest of understanding the effects of increased transitional 
benefits fishman said 
but after the plans were outlined in a dallas morning news story 
on sunday that was distributed nationwide hhs officials began 
getting calls and sullivan called off the plans 
officials said sullivan was unaware of the projects provisions 
until then when they were outlined to him he made it clear he 
does not want this type of provision included in any of our 
programs said martin gerry assistant secretary for planning and 
evaluation gerry said he knew of no current hhs programs that deny 
benefits entitled by federal law 
five other states ohio washington state new york new jersey 
and wisconsin were conducting similar demonstration projects 
which also have had to be revised none has proposed to continue 
the current transitional benefits past the april 1 effective date 
of the new benefits as set in law

former president reagan will give videotaped 
testimony friday in a los angeles courtroom to lawyers for former 
national security adviser john poindexter and irancontra 
prosecutors 
us district court judge harold greene on monday rejected 
proposals by richard beckler one of poindexters lawyers to delay 
the questioning of reagan until the government finished presenting 
its case and to have reagan come to washington to give the 
testimony 
greene said he would consider the presidents wishes and was 
prepared to travel to california for the testimony 
in order to edit the reagan tape and to attempt to resolve 
disputes over some 150 classified documents greene moved back the 
start of the trial two weeks to march 5 poindexter is charged with 
conspiracy obstructing congress and making false statements in the 
irancontra scandal 
greene also rejected a suggestion by reagan lawyer theodore 
olson that the former president be questioned at his office in los 
angeles the federal courthouse has more space and also has secure 
facilities to house classified documents said the judge 
seven news organizations want the press and public admitted to 
the deposition but greene said he doubts he will let them in 
because of concern over possible disclosure of classified 
information 
he will rule on the news medias request before friday 
a week ago the judge said beckler would be permitted to ask 
reagan 154 questions plus followups the former president agreed 
friday to submit to the deposition reserving the option to invoke 
executive privilege to specific questions 
irancontra prosecutors will be permitted to crossexamine the 
expresident 
participating in the deposition will be prosecutors from the 
office of independent counsel lawrence walsh poindexters lawyers 
attorneys for the justice department lawyers for reagan 
representatives from us intelligence agencies and the judge 
the list of questions has been reviewed by intelligence agencies 
and appears to pose few problems with the exception of half a 
dozen questions which could lead into sensitive foreign policy 
matters 
reagan will be well prepared for the deposition 
he knows poindexters questions in advance reagans lawyers on 
friday received three secret proffers poindexter submitted to the 
court some time ago detailing what information he expects to elicit 
from the former president 
poindexter in turn will not have access to certain information 
about reagan 
reagans former national security adviser has been unable to get 
some 33 diary entries from reagan because the expresident invoked 
executive privilege last week that dispute wont be resolved until 
next month at the earliest 
in addition poindexter cannot gain access to answers which 
reagan supplied to written questions by irancontra prosecutors 
also poindexters lawyers say they have had only limited 
success in reviewing notes taken by reagan 
poindexter lawyer fred robinson said some notes taken by reagan 
regarding the irancontra affair are stored at the national 
archives greene said he wanted a report today from the justice 
department and irancontra prosecutors on the status and 
availability of the presidents notes

president bush is hailing solid progress 
on arms talks but standing firm on his troop cut proposal despite 
mikhail s gorbachevs contention that it would leave the soviet 
union outmanned in europe 
bush at a white house news conference monday predicted his 
summit in late june with the soviet president will be a major 
success 
he said secretary of state james a baker iii made solid 
progress in pushing the ussoviet agenda forward during his 
trip to moscow last week 
but even as bush applauded the soviet communist partys moves 
toward pluralism and gorbachevs statesmanlike view on 
german unity he acknowledged he was unwilling to accept the soviet 
leaders counterproposal on troop cuts in europe 
and as bush insisted a united germany must be part of nato 
gorbachev was quoted by an east german news agency as saying a 
united germany within nato was unacceptable 
national security adviser brent scowcroft said monday night 
thats not exactly what secretary of state james a baker iii 
was told was told during his visit to moscow last week it was 
not really as positive as that scowcroft said after a state 
dinner for the president of the congo 
bush expressed misgivings about economic sanctions against south 
africa saying some are counterproductive but he said im 
bound by law to keep the sanctions in place until south africas 
white minority government takes further steps to eliminate its 
racist apartheid rule 
he called the freeing of nelson mandela clearly a very 
positive sign and expressed appreciation for south african 
president fw de klerk and his new brand of leadership 
on troop cuts in europe bush said he was sticking with the 
proposal he made jan 31 that soviet troops be cut to 195000 and 
us troops to 225000 gorbachev last week the soviet and us 
troop levels should be the same 
but bush said weve got a big ocean between us and western 
europe i dont think we need to have exact linkage from this 
point on his argument is that in time of war the soviets could 
easily reinforce their troops in central europe from their own 
territory while the united states would have to fly or ship troops 
in from this country 
but he said i wouldnt call it an impasse this is the way it 
works when youre discussing these arms control things 
bush said he hoped treaties on reducing longrange nuclear 
weapons and chemical weapons would be substantially completed 
by the june summit and there would be progress as well toward 
signing a troop reduction agreement 
he said all three treaties might not be completed by june 
however 
gorbachevs troop counterproposal would mean the withdrawal of 
an additional 30000 us soldiers bush wants to keep in britain 
spain and turkey 
but said bush those soviet troops are not wanted in 
eastern europe anymore our troops are wanted by the free world 
bush suggested that even if a united germany belongs in nato 
as west german chancellor helmut kohl has said western alliance 
forces may not be deployed inside what is now east germany 
theres some flexibility on deployment of nato forces into 
eastern europe nobody wants to threaten the soviet union he 
said 
asked about links between mandelas african national congress 
and communist organizations bush said i think these communist 
parties for the most part are sliding downhill whats coming 
uphill is democracy and freedom 
he said he differs with the anc on its support for nationalizing 
south african industries socialism he said is folding its hand 
and going over to the other side all across the world 
on other issues bush 
said he would decide fairly soon whether to permit the sale 
of leases for offshore drilling on the california coast the 
onetime houston oilman said that despite last weeks tanker spill 
ill be damned if i think we ought to shut down offshore drilling 
everywhere 
called counterproductive a new chinese government 
requirement that students spend five years working at home before 
studying abroad 
said he would tell the presidents of colombia peru and bolivia 
at thursdays drug summit in colombia that the united states was 
making major efforts to curb us demand for cocaine

charge a grand jury has been hearing evidence in the mayors case 
for months 
the washington post reported in todays editions that a grand 
jury investigating allegations of drug use by barry will be asked

five counts drug use federal sources would not confirm the 
stations report saying only that they expect the grand jury to 
return an indictment probably next week 
barry entered the florida center for what an aide described as 
primarily treatment of alcoholism barry publicly acknowledged 
during a church service on sunday having an alcohol dependency 
problem but did not mention cocaine according to another 
worshipper 
one government aide said city officials and the mayors 
political advisers agreed with the doctors recommendations that 
the mayor remain in florida beyond 28 days 
they hanleyhazelden physicians have determined that he 
really requires additional treatment said a city official 
familiar with the discussions 
the longer the mayor stays down there the better he will be 
able to convince people that he has genuinely been seeking 
treatment said one political adviser this is really the 
better thing for him

system 
the suspended roadway which is west of the northsouth

daredevil evel knievel 
then the last few miles of i90 were laid across lake 
washington improving traffic between suburban bellevue and seattle 
at a cost of 145 billion and the entire complex is scheduled for 
completion in the winter of 1991 
the highways giant concrete tentacles extend into the 
commercial area south of downtown and to the kingdome home of the 
seahawks and mariners sports teams it will be finished for 689 
million 
the viaducts also will carry bus traffic into a new bus tunnel

in its revolutionary new platform the ruling 
communist party casts aside marxist economic theory by accepting 
private property and backs a strong presidency that would further 
erode its 72year grip on power 
the platform advocates a bill of rights to protect the 
individual against abuses of the state in a country where stalinist 
authorities stripped millions of peasants of land and had political 
opponents murdered by the thousands 
the document approved during a landmark meeting last week and 
published monday represents president mikhail s gorbachevs 
boldest break with communist orthodoxy and contradicts public 
statements he made just months ago 
the official tass news agency said leaders called monday for a 
special session of the congress of peoples deputies in the near 
future to strength the office of presidency which would solidify 
gorbachevs hold on power 
the countrys highest executive body the presidium of the 
supreme soviet unanimously favored the establishment of 
democratic presidential power in our country tass reported 
it also said without elaboration that the presidium wanted the 
congress which was seated last spring in the countrys first 
contested elections in seven decades to consider the ownership of 
property and strengthening the soviet government gorbachev had 
called for the congress to convene in june 
the statement did not say whether the president should be 
directly elected by voters but one of gorbachevs key allies 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said last week that a 
nationwide popular election might be possible 
in deciding on sweeping changes the platform says the party 
took into account the new hunger of citizens for democracy and 
reform as expressed by mass rallies and local political organizing 
all over the country 
the new platform abandons the communists ideological roots 
the communist party of the soviet union believes the existence 
of individual property including ownership of the means of 
production does not contradict the modern stage in the countrys 
economic development 
marxist theory holds that factories and other means of producing 
goods must be owned by the state rather than individuals because 
private ownership inevitably results in one person exploiting the 
labor of another 
the platform says stateowned property should be turned over to 
worker control through leasing contracts jointstock holdings and 
other methods 
communists intend to create and economy based on a diversity 
of property forms competition between independent manufacturers a 
developed financial system and on the powerful stimuli of personal 
and collective interest the platform says 
at last weeks meeting the communist partys policymaking 
central committee voted to relinquish the partys guaranteed 
leading role and accept that it must compete with other parties for 
the right to govern 
the authority of the party which gorbachev heads as general 
secretary is in steep decline as citizens angered at mismanagement 
and official corruption hold it responsible for the dismal state of 
the economy 
communist central authority also faces increased challenges from 
secessionist movements throughout the restive union and at the 
polls where communists are expected to show poorly in local 
elections this spring 
popular revolutions have in the past year thrown out communist 
leaders in moscows former eastern european satellites 
central planning has left the soviet union unable to provide its 
people with adequate food housing and consumer goods and the 
platform says the system has been characterized by monopoly lack 
of initiative wastefulness mismanagement and disregard for 
consumers interests 
the young soviet state under lenins leadership confiscated most 
private property after the 1917 revolution and stalins drive to 
strip peasants of their land through collectivization in the 1930s 
claimed millions of lives through famine deportation and summary 
execution 
the platform did not make clear in what sense the party still 
considers itself to be communist but pays homage to the creative 
spirit of marxism and the philospohys humanistic outlook 
it said the party is committed to protect a citizens 
personality and honor the immunity of his home and property the 
secrecy of correspondence 
the platform backs freedoms of conscience religion assembly 
speech the press and citizen participation in running the 
affairs of society and the state 
soviet laws long have promised wide political freedoms but 
until gorbachev came to power in 1985 the communists dominated 
every aspect of life and persecuted critics and potential 
challengers 
in a departure from one of the marxist slogans once used to 
justify rule by terror and liquidation of the middle class the 
party dismissed the concept of a dictatorship of the proletariat 
saying the ruleoflaw state of the whole people has no room for 
dictatorship by any class 
the platform introduces the concept of competition once taboo 
among communist ideologists as a necessary tool for regulating 
prices and ensuring availability of goods and services it calls 
for legislation to break up state monopolies trade credit 
services and insurance businesses to permit competitive consumer 
services 
as recently as november gorbachev stated firm opposition to 
permitting soviet citizens to hold private property 
but he has changed signals on several issues in recent weeks in 
january he reversed his longstanding opposition to the party 
giving up its guaranteed monopoly on power 
all constitutional questions such as powers of the presidency 
must be decided by the congress which is supposed to meet briefly 
twice a year 
under reforms pushed through by gorbachev in december 1988 the 
president is chosen by the congress

cutbacks in us economic aid and 
rare american criticism of president corazon aquinos stewardship 
have strained relations with washington which helped save her from 
military mutineers two months ago 
the new strains have emerged as the two governments prepare for 
talks possibly next month on extending the lease on the six us 
military bases which expires next year 
in the clearest sign of tension mrs aquino announced sunday 
that she would refuse to meet defense secretary richard cheney when 
he visits the philippines next week 
she cited recent statements from american officials who blamed 
the december coup attempt in part on corruption and inefficiency in 
her government 
mrs aquino claims the mutineers were simply trying to grab 
power and that their criticisms had no validity 
i believe i have been a victim of inaccurate reporting not 
from the philippine press but from the american press mrs 
aquino told reporters monday i believe it is best at this time 
to just instruct defense secretary fidel ramos on whatever 
there is to say to secretary cheney 
on dec 1 us air force f4 phantom jets flew air cover for 
government forces battling mutineers seeking to overthrow mrs 
aquino 
although the jets never fired a shot it is widely believed that 
us intervention was decisive in defeating the mutiny because of 
the psychological impact of such strong american support for mrs 
aquino 
since the coup attempt however us officials have publicly 
criticized the aquino government for failing to curb corruption and 
deliver basic services to the countrys 58 million people 
the greatest deterrent to future coup attempts will be 
forceful sustained action by the government to address those 
grievances shared by the rebels and the populace deputy 
assistant secretary of state carl ford told the house subcommittee 
on asia and the pacific last month 
commenting on fords testimony mrs aquino said i do not 
agree with him on the matter of the grievances of the coup plotters 
that they cite graft and corruption and other grievances all of 
the six coup attempts were basically to grab power and not to 
submit themselves to the democratic processes 
fords statement marked a significant departure from what us 
diplomats say had been an unofficial policy of never criticizing 
mrs aquino publicly 
criticism by american officials always makes a significant 
impact here most filipinos believe as an article of faith that 
washington orchestrates events in their country and that criticism 
signals diminishing us support 
adding to the strain was the bush administrations failure to 
fulfill a pledge made during talks in 1988 on allowing clark air 
base the subic bay naval base and four smaller installations to 
remain through the end of their lease 
during the talks thensecretary of state george shultz agreed 
to seek 962 million in economic aid to the philippines over two 
years 
this year the bush administration asked congress to provide the 
philippines with 200 million in military assistance and 160 
million in economic support but congress cut the overall request 
by 96 million 
any agreement extending the bases beyond 1991 must be approved 
by twothirds of the 23member senate the chambers president 
jovito salonga suggested talks be postponed until the cuts are 
restored 
on monday rep ramon mitra speaker of the house of 
representatives said he would sponsor a resolution urging mrs 
aquino to postpone bases talks until the united states restores aid 
cuts and halts its black propaganda

of happiness in the pool of couples who remain married

here are excerpts from the soviet communist party 
platform adopted by the central committee last week and published 
by tass 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the party seeks to place man in the center of social 
development providing him with worthy living and working 
conditions guaranteeing him social justice political liberty and 
possibilities for comprehensive development and spiritual 
fulfillment and regards this as its main goal this is exactly 
what should determine social progress 
the soviet communist party stands for the earliest formulation 
of legal acts guaranteeing the rights and freedoms of citizens the 
recognition of personal liberty as the key and vital value and an 
aboutface to guarantee the entire complex of human rights is 
perestroikas most important accomplishment now it is necessary to 
consolidate these rights to rest them on a solid material legal 
and political foundation 
the party will uphold 
reliable legislative protection of a citizens personality and 
honor the immunity of his home and property the secrecy of 
correspondence and telephone conversations 
stronger guarantees to realize the right to work including 
payment according to the quantity and quality of work done and its 
final results the formation of a mechanism to maintain employment 
training and retraining of personnel and adequate material support 
for those who are forced to change their trade profession or place 
of work 
the development and strengthening of the political rights of 
citizens participation in running the affairs of society and the 
state freedom of speech the press meetings and demonstrations 
and the formation of public organizations law and order and 
requirements of soviet laws should be strictly observed 
freedom for creative activities and attitude to talent as a 
national asset 
mans free selfdetermination in the spiritual sphere the 
freedom of conscience and religion without abandoning its world 
outlook the party will step up the dialogue between atheists and 
believers and pursue a policy that offers all churches the 
opportunity to freely operate within the law contributing to 
mutual understanding between people 
a higher role of the court of law in protecting civil rights 
the establishment of publicstate commissions exercising 
lawenforcing activities 
the cpsu communist party of the soviet union puts priority on 
the adoption of laws in the near future on the press and other mass 
media freedom of conscience and religious associations public 
associations the order of emigration from and immigration to the 
ussr soviet citizenship languages of soviet peoples and other 
legislative acts that will guarantee the political and personal 
rights of citizens 
every means envisaged by law should be used to combat crime 
while the presumption of innocence and the right to protection and 
juridical norms should be strictly observed 
</TEXT>

the solution of the food problem should rest on the development 
of all forms of economic management in agriculture staterun 
cooperative and individual farms and diverse forms of management 
based on contract leasing and other principles should be given 
equal possibilities 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
we continue to focus on efforts to increase the production of 
consumer goods the cpsu will help implement measures to help 
satiate the market 
the party advocates an effective finance recovery program 
including such measures as the encouragement of deposits in savings 
banks at increased interest rates the development of the insurance 
business the distribution of state loan bonds on advantageous 
terms the selling of dwellings advance payments by the population 
for durable goods they plan to buy in the future and the selling of 
stocks and other securities 
more flexible economic instruments and quotas will be needed to 
prevent unfounded incomes and the issue of money in excess of the 
supply of goods 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the cpsu believes the existence of individual property 
including ownership of the means of production does not contradict 
the modern stage in the countrys economic development 
one of the most difficult aspects of the economic reform is 
finding an organic combination of plan and market methods to 
regulate economic activity 
modern production is impossible without a centralized planned 
management this essentially socialist principle of economic 
management has been adopted by many countries 
however it is crucially important to determine the precise 
degree and methods of such management unlike in the past when the 
plan attempted to encompass the entire process of production and 
distribution there is now a need for a procedure in which planned 
centralized economic management will be exercised through prices 
taxes interest rates credits payments etc 
the creation of a fullfledged market economy requires the 
formation of markets of consumer products capital goods 
securities investment currencies and research and development 
and an early reform of the financial monetary and credit systems 
the restructuring of price formation is a sine qua non condition 
for the market to start regulating the economy the artificial 
price levels and proportions the burden of ineffective subsidies 
for some and ruinous deductions from others provide false 
referencepoints for economic management they confound the 
assessment of managements effect perpetuate scientific and 
technological backwardness and prevent the efficient utilization of 
the advantages of the international division of labor

principles of universal equal direct suffrage we wish elections

the development of society does not preclude the possibility of 
forming parties the procedure for their formation will be 
established by law and reflected in the constitution of the ussr 
the formation and activity of organizations and movements that 
expound violence and interethnic strife and that pursue extremist

the question of instituting the post of head of state 
president responsible to the congress of ussr peoples 
deputies and having the necessary powers is posed by society ever 
more insistently 
a president is needed to maintain the countrys stable 
development to speed up perestroika to guarantee its 
irreversibility to ensure the normal and effective functioning of 
all state and public institutions in the process of 
democratization to ensure law and citizens security to protect 
the soviet unions interests and to represent our state on the

a ruleoflaw state presupposes effective political guidance of 
the defense the accountability of the military department to the 
supreme civil authorities and maximum openness in the activity of 
the military department taking into account the level of 
confidence among states 
internal security in view of the need to protect state 
frontiers counteract foreign intelligence agencies protect the 
soviet constitutional system and the rights of citizens we should 
be attentive to the needs of frontier and internal troops which 
fulfill complex and at times dangerous duties 
remaining vital to the maintenance of public order interior and 
state security bodies should operate strictly within the law and 
under control of elective government bodies

<TEXT>
the principle of the selfdetermination of nations in a renewed 
soviet federation presupposes the freedom of nationalstate 
entities to choose forms by which to structure life institutions 
and symbols of statehood our ideal is not unification but unity 
in diversity 
the party reaffirms its commitment to lenins principle of the 
right of nations to selfdetermination including secession and 
favors the adoption of a law on a mechanism for the exercise of 
this right 
at the same time we are convinced that the weakening and 
disruption of reciprocally diverse and interrelated ties could lead 
to negative consequences for all peoples to say nothing about 
individual destinies consequences that are very difficult to 
foresee 
that is why we resolutely oppose separatist slogans and 
movements that would lead to the destruction of the great 
multiethnic democratic state

he built a billiondollar empire of hotels and 
real estate owns a casino and an airline that bear his name and 
wrote a best seller called the art of the deal 
but the art of making a marriage work appears to have eluded 
donald trump he and his wife ivana have split after nearly 13 
years of marriage proving once again that money cant buy you 
love 
in fact money is a source of contention between the two 
despite a prenuptial agreement under which she was to get custody 
of their three children the greenwich conn mansion and 25 
million 
trump 43 is worth considerably more 17 billion to 4 
billion depending on whos counting 
ivanas lawyer michael kennedy issued a statement monday 
saying we do not consider the socalled prenuptial agreement to 
be serious it will have no relevance to a court because it is 
unconscionable and fraudulent 
in response donalds spokesman said the prenuptial agreement 
signed by donald and ivana trump is a long and detailed document 
which covers all aspects and is 100 percent enforceable in courts 
of law the agreement they have was updated approximately two years 
ago prior to that this agreement has been updated on numerous 
other occasions throughout the years 
while lawyers and imagemakers battle it out with press 
releases tabloids and tv stations always enamored of the 
tuxedoed trump and the bejeweled begowned ivana lap it up 
the new york post today reported that donald locked ivana out of 
her office monday at the plaza hotel 
the post citing unidentified sources also reported that some 
of ivanas jewelry is missing 
trump had given her the jobs of running the plaza and the trump 
castle in atlantic city nj for a salary as he put it of one 
dollar plus all the dresses she can buy 
it was not clear whether ivana a former czechoslovakian ski 
racer and sometime model who turns 41 next week will continue with 
her hotel work 
on monday the post quoted donald saying that ivanas level of 
arrogance has grown steadily worse in recent years the bottom line 
is i dont want to create another leona helmsley 
mrs helmsley is the selfdescribed hotel queen recently 
convicted of tax evasion at her trial former employees described 
her as illtempered and demanding 
i have told ivana whatever leona would do do the opposite 
be nice to everybody and she is nice anyway trump told 
playboy magazine in an interview in the march issue 
nice aside trump told columnist liz smith who broke the story 
of the breakup in sundays daily news it is better for ivana and 
me to separate at this time but i am leaving because i want to 
leave 
ivana is a wonderful woman and a very good woman and i like 
her we might even get back together i cant say we wont and 
as for those other women i have been linked with well i want to 
say that we are all just friends and thats as far as it goes 
trump said 
pictures of those other women were plastered across a page of 
the new york post actresses catherine oxenberg and marla maples 
and skater peggy fleming across the top of a page 
new york newspapers trotted out as evidence of trouble in 
trump paradise the story of ivana in an aspen restaurant over 
the holidays reportedly warning maples a former miss georgia 
runnerup and star of a movie called maximum overdrive to stay 
away from donald the trumps were then seen arguing on the slopes 
a few days later maples reportedly told ivana i love him and 
if you dont why dont you let him go the post said

the united nations and egypt have begun a 
campaign to rebuild the alexandria library which stored the roots 
of greek and jewish civilization before its destruction 17 
centuries ago 
in the hotel where agatha christie wrote part of death on the 
nile international royalty politicians and cultural celebrities 
gathered monday to endorse a 90 million fundraising drive 
sheik zayed bin sultan alnahyan president of the united arab 
emirates kicked it off with a pledge of 20 million 
the recreation of alexander the greats library will cost 
nearly 150 million including more than 60 million from egypt in 
the form of equipment and the purchase of the mediterranean 
seafront site 
egypt which owes foreign creditors 50 billion has decided 
to carry out this colossal work and give it top priority in spite 
of the challenge it faces for realizing comprehensive economic 
reform president hosni mubarak said 
egypt can never relinquish its pioneer civilizational role 
which it should play by virtue of its history and location 
mubarak said this is what the world expects of egypt 
the general director of the un educational scientific and 
cultural organization egypts cosponsor for the project admitted 
the cost is high but said fostering knowledge the supreme 
resource is worth it 
there are those who will say 150 million is a high price to 
pay when so many apparently more pressing needs clamor for our 
attention said federico mayor a spaniard 
are we to place a lower value on a library than on a 
superbomber at a time when the disarmament momentum is growing 
the promotion of knowledge deserves to be one of the first peace 
dividends 
construction is scheduled to begin on the mammoth library 
complex late this year with completion in mid1995 the complex 
will cover 722000 square feet including 277800 square feet for 
the 10story library itself museums a planetarium a center for 
book and manuscript preservation and related facilities are planned 
mubaraks wife suzanne who is leading the project said it 
concerns every man everywhere no matter his geographical 
position political affiliation or religious creed 
the original bibliotheca alexandrina thrived for centuries as a 
seat of scientific cultural and academic lore it was in 
alexandria that euclid thrived jewish scholars translated the old 
testament from hebrew into greek and homers works were collected 
wellestablished by 285 bc the librarys 500000 volumes 
remained at the heart of mediterranean academic life until it was 
destroyed in a series of fires in wartime and riots 
the destruction was so complete that its site and design still 
are debated

monaco and greek actress melina mercouri also attended mondays

the old image of school volunteers raising 
money with bake sales and coaching sports teams needs to be 
broadened to include business executives and retirees who do 
everything from tutoring to counseling 
on the other hand the national research council study issued 
monday also found that public schools with high minority enrollment 
use few if any volunteers of any type 
volunteers in public schools found that some 13 million 
people were school volunteers during the 198788 school year about 
60 percent of public schools and 65 percent of private schools 
reported having volunteers 
twenty to 30 years ago most school volunteers were mothers of 
school children but this source has been reduced as women have 
moved into paid employment the study said 
increasingly people from the business community retired 
citizens and college students have been actively recruited by 
school systems and these groups now constitute a substantial 
portion of volunteers 
public schools with high minority enrollment 50 percent or 
more were less likely to use volunteers and reported fewer on 
average than did schools with lower minority enrollment said the 
study

three girls looking for more strenuous 
hikes bike rides and rock climbing have signed up with the scouts 
breaking an allboys tradition in british scouting that dates from 
its foundation in 1908 
i am really thrilled that we are being allowed to join at 
last said nicola lowes a former girl guide as she and two 
friends signed membership certificates monday night 
we have nothing against the guides but we found it a bit 
tame 14yearold nicola told reporters in wark a village in 
northeast england 
the move follows the decision announced thursday by britains 
chief scout garth morrison to admit girls 
nicola christel wilson 15 and gillian ridley 14 applied to 
join the wark scout troop in october nicola said they were 
looking forward to playing tough games with the boys and going on 
hikes rock climbing bike rides and all the things the lads do 
bob hogarth leader of the wark troop said he and the 12 boys 
in the troop aged 10 to 15 favored having them in but the girls 
were rejected because of the allboys rule 
geoff richardson the regions scout commissioner said that 
like boys who join the girls will have to undergo basic training 
before being invested as full members 
morrison said on thursday that it would be left to each local 
scout troop to decide whether to admit girls he described it as 
an important move and a move in the right direction 
dr june patersonbrown chief commissioner of britains girl 
guides association said the move made her angry if they try to 
poach our girls then it will make things very difficult 
the boy scouts of america movement has allowed girls aged 
between 6 and 15 in its explorer division for about 19 years 
lord badenpowell the british soldier who founded the scout 
movement with his 1908 manual scouting for boys originally 
envisaged it as a body of young lookouts to keep an enemy under 
surveillance

democratic gubernatorial candidate john r silber 
sparked protests from jewish organizations after saying he 
encountered racism among jews when he once considered converting 
in an article in the boston sunday globe silber who is on 
leave as president of boston university said he considered 
converting to judaism in 1948 but decided against it because of 
their treatment of converts 
i thought about it and then found out that the racism of jews 
is quite phenomenal silber told the newspaper last week 
if you are goyim considering becoming a jew you are going to 
be secondclass in that synagogue and i didnt have any interest 
at all in moving into that congregation as a secondclass citizen 
in a statement monday silber attempted to explain his comments 
and said i have never suggested that judaism is racist 
but jewish leaders decried silbers comments 
what may have been true of his own experience in 1948 with a 
certain number of jews in a particular congregation can hardly be 
accepted as the basis for a generalization said leonard zakim 
executive director of the new england chapter of the 
antidefamation league of bnai brith 
however zakim conceded that while silbers words might have 
been illchosen the comments do not diminish the candidates work 
on behalf of the jewish people 
i dont think it changes the fact of his friendship toward the 
jewish community and israel zakim said 
joel reck president of the jewish community relations council 
of greater boston said silber is and has always been close to 
and a friend and supporter of jews judaism and israel 
silber who after 1948 discovered his father was jewish was 
deterred from joining a synagogue by the reluctance of members of 
that congregation to accept him because his mother was not 
jewish his statement said monday 
nothing in that experience diminished my deep respect for 
judaism and my concern affection and support for the jewish people 
and for israel a concern that has been demonstrated with 
consistency throughout my adult life the statement said 
but state rep david b cohen president of the new england 
region of the american jewish congress protested silbers comments 
any time anyone characterizes members of an ethnic or 
religious group with a broadbrush generality he is engaging in 
just that type of stereotyping and prejudice that we are trying to 
remove from the american political scene i am astonished 
disturbed and disappointed that the term racism was used in this 
context cohen said 
lawrence d lowenthal executive director of the local american 
jewish committee said silbers remarks about jews are simply 
blatant insults to the jewish community

hopes dimmed for four crosscountry skiers 
feared buried in a massive avalanche two days ago as about 50 
people set out today to search a halfmile stretch of deep show 
it looks pretty bleak bob haney chief warden for banff 
national park said monday after a day of ground and aerial 
surveillance led rescuers to areas deemed remotely possible where 
they could have been 
they indicated quite a number of places haney said we 
dug down with no positive results it all brings us back to this 
one massive slide path 
officials called sundays avalanche one of the largest in recent 
history 
mondays search was hampered by snow driven by a biting wind 
that sent temperatures plunging four tracking dogs searched a 
6milelong trail for any scent of the four along the slopes about 
50 miles west of calgary 
the avalanche path itself looked like a lunar landscape with 
some snow slabs the size of my truck said reporter chris dawson 
of the calgary herald it was an absolutely sobering experience 
i can tell you my heart was in my throat 
the searchers expected to advance short distances today and 
shove long thin hightension rods into the snow until they reach 
ground level or strike a body 
the royal canadian mounted police said the missing skiers were 
charles coombes 55 a physics professor at the university of 
calgary his wife clara 56 verne powell 49 an engineer with 
transalta utilities and charles lorenzo 58 a composing room 
employee at the calgary herald 
a fifth person lilie collins 50 turned back before the 
avalanche because of fatigue

gen michel aoun called up reserve forces 
today in apparent preparation for an assault to overrun part of the 
christian enclave north of beirut and cripple a rival christian 
militia 
aouns gunners and militiamen of samir geageas lebanese forces 
dueled with howitzers and mortars in east beirut and the 
snowblanketed mountains northeast of the capital in the 15th day 
of the intrachristian showdown 
the lebanese red cross committee issued radio appeals for urgent 
blood donations and police reported early in the day that rescuers 
removed 18 rotting corpses from east beirut streets 
a police spokesman who cannot be named in line with 
regulations said nine people were killed and 22 wounded in the 
fighting today between aouns fighters and geageas militiamen in 
east beirut and kesrouan province 
by police count the overall toll stood at 498 killed and 1724 
wounded since the struggle began jan 30 for domination of the 
310squaremile christian enclave 
geagea in an interview with the arabic service of radio monte 
carlo said monday he had talked to aoun by telephone and asked for 
peace negotiaions 
i told the general that we should negotiate to put an end to 
this useless war but i cannot accept to be annihilated geagea 
said he did not say when the conversation took place 
the command of aouns estimated 19000strong army in a 
communique called up reservists and volunteers who received 
training in the use of weapons during a sixmonth confrontation 
with the syrians last summer 
the additional fighters the communique said will be 
immediately armed to join their units it did not give further 
details 
aoun is believed to have a reserve force of about 2000 retired 
military personnel in addition to a 4000 volunteerreserve 
fighters 
beiruts prestigious annahar newspaper said the intrachristian 
confrontation was heading for a swift conclusive battle 
it said aoun wanted to overrun the kesrouan province a 
traditional stronghold for geageas 6000strong militia to seize 
the harbor facilities and central bank offices in jounieh 12 
miles from beirut 
military sources speaking on condition of anonymity also said 
aoun appeared determined to dislodge geageas militia from its main 
power base in kesrouan 
one source said aouns gunners were maintaining artillery 
barrages and a series of hitandrun attacks against the militia in 
kesrouan to run down their enemys ammunition and effort before 
the major battle 
there have been no significant gains in territory since the 
confrontation shifted to the kesrouan province on saturday the 
source noted 
police reported civilians were fleeing the mountain resorts of 
ajaltoun bekfaya and daraya despite heavy snows to escape the 
battle everybody seems to expect 
president elias hrawi appealed monday to the superpowers france 
and the vatican to support possible intervention by his 
syrianbacked troops to halt the fighting 
hrawi made a similar appeal last week beirut newspapers said 
pope john paul ii and france traditional protector of lebanons 
christians warned against syrian military intervention 
aoun does not recognize hrawis christianmoslem government 
which is backed by syria he also has vowed to drive the syrians 
who support the moslem militias of west beirut from lebanon

thousands of washington teachers are 
pressing for higher salaries with a oneday walkout today while 
the governor expressed sympathy but rejected a pay boost this 
winter 
about 200000 students faced a winters day off with the planned 
walkout by by 13000 teachers in 35 of the states 296 school 
districts eight thousand other teachers pledged to attend 
afterhour rallies and marches 
a similar stalemate is developing in west virgina where 
thousands of teachers have said they would leave their classrooms 
thursday to protest low wages and education funding despite the 
governors stand the state has no money for them 
in washington state seattles 43000 students were among those 
facing a day off the protest was mostly confined to western 
washington but teachers everywhere were angry over gov booth 
gardners decision to ignore the organizations request for 
immediate 10 percent pay increases union officials said monday 
we want the public to understand were reaching a crisis point 
in washington said teresa moore spokeswoman for the 
49000member washington education association 
but a group called citizens united for better education 
denounced the walkouts 
i dont think it sets a good example for a third grader when 
their teacher is standing on the street corner chanting hell no 
we want more said fred brown president of the 
woodinvillebased group 
the legislature approved a twostep pay boost of 10 percent last 
year the union wants another 10 percent a retroactive 6 percent 
for this school year and 4 percent in the fall 
such an increase would cost about 225 million which union 
officials said could be financed by a 611 million state budget 
surplus 
gardner a democrat who has called himself the education 
governor told a rally of about 250 school board members and 
school administrators monday that he is committed to developing a 
worldclass education system 
but he said the state budget surplus is a onetime phenomenon 
and nothing on which to base continuing salary increases 
gardner said he wants to keep one third of the windfall in 
reserve spend one third on childrens programs such as school 
improvements and hiring more child protective services workers and 
use the rest to cover other needs such as as cost increases in 
social programs and general government 
but the union said teacher salaries should be a priority 
salaries have dropped from fourth in the nation a few years 
ago to 21st today moore said that has an impact on national 
competitiveness the ability to keep good teachers and also an 
impact on how we can attract new people into the profession 
the average teacher is being paid about 33100 plus 2100 in 
supplemental pay for extra chores acording to the governors 
office of financial management starting pay is about 18000 
in west virginia at least 2400 union teachers in five counties 
had voted by monday night to walk out thursday for a rally at the 
capitol union teachers in nine other counties also voted to walk 
out but their numbers were not known 
the momentum is growing said west virginia education 
association vice president jennie shaffer 
west virginias 22000 teachers earn an average of 21904 a 
year which ranks 48th nationally according to union leaders gov 
gaston caperton has not included a pay raise in his 199091 budget 
the governor has said over and over and over again that 
there is no money for teacher raises in 199091 spokesman gc 
morse said monday night theres gotta be a point where people 
realize were not making this up 
but mary carden president of the boone county education 
association said theres a myth that the state is broke and 
were not buying into it weve had two governors who said they 
wanted to help education and they havent done it

jurors cleared monsanto co of any liability in a 
lawsuit brought by more than 200 homeowners who feared chemical 
waste dumped by the company near their homes endangered their 
health 
i just dont believe this im in shock said judy romeo 
who abandoned her home of four years about five months ago im 
going to go home and have a good cry 
the 222 homeowners sought 355 million in damages from monsanto 
which is the chief user of the brio waste site near their 
subdivision the plaintiffs asked for 16 million each which they 
said was equivalent to monsantos daily profit margin 
but jurors in the unanimous verdict monday said the plaintiffs 
had failed to show that it was unsafe to live in the southbend 
subdivision southeast of houston 
it was a very very difficult decision said jury foreman 
alfred morales i would have to say that there was lack of 
evidence in my opinion that we were looking at 
juror jim stecker said i believe that it is safe to live out 
there 
homeowner herb bateman disagreed he said he moved his family 
from the subdivision in august because we felt our lives and our 
childrens lives were in danger 
michael waldeck an attorney for the homeowners said he would 
appeal 
the jurys verdict came after nearly a week of deliberations and 
four months of testimony in state district court 
the homeowners said the brio waste site has led to medical 
problems ranging from upset stomachs to headaches some residents 
testified they feared contracting cancer in the future because they 
live so close to the waste site 
monsanto denied responsibility for any injuries saying it is 
one of many companies that has used the dump site

soviet soldiers and armored vehicles controlled 
the center of tadzhikistans capital today but rioting that claimed 
the lives of seven people and injured scores was spreading to the 
suburbs a journalist reported 
rioting broke out in the central asian republics capital of 
dushanbe on monday after rumors spread that armenian refugees from 
ethnic violence in the caucasus were being given preference for new 
housing at the expense of natives 
the rioters smashed windows and set fire to the ground floor of 
the republics communist party headquarters and attacked stores and 
passersby said anatoly larenov a correspondent for the national 
newspaper vozdushny transport 
seven people were killed and 79 hospitalized with injuries he 
said 
musafar madzhidov correspondent for official radio and 
television in dushanbe said rioting broke out after two rallies in 
a 24hour period prompted by the rumors of preferential housing 
members of the crowd shouted down with the armenians he 
said 
the soviet news agency tass reported monday night that a state 
of emergency was declared in the city to quell mass disorders and 
pogroms and acts of arson and looting it said a 10 pm to 6 
am curfew was imposed 
it was the latest violent flareup in ethnic unrest that has 
spread throughout the soviet unions southern rim in recent months 
as moscow loosens control and allows nationalist mass movements to 
gain strength and challenge communist authorities 
larenov said in a telephone interview that the center of 
dushanbe was quiet today after the curfew ended for the night 
tanks and soldiers were stationed in front of the party 
headquarters banks and other institutions and the center of the 
city was under military control 
but he said trouble was spreading to the suburbs of dushanbe a 
city of more than 500000 people 
larenov said officials had evacuated armenian families before 
the trouble started monday and that most of the anger was directed 
at russianspeaking people a list of those killed did not appear 
to include any armenian names 
armenians a predominantly christian people have been involved 
for the last two years in bloody dispute with predominantly moslem 
azerbaijanis over control of the nagornokarabakh region of 
azerbaijan 
more than 200 people have been killed in the southern caucasus 
republics of armenia and azerbaijan since jan 13 president 
mikhail s gorbachev sent thousands of soldiers into the area to 
end a nationalist revolt in the azerbaijani capital of baku and end 
attacks on armenians 
until monday there had been no reports that the trouble had 
spread to the predominantly moslem republics of soviet central asia 
such as tadzhikistan 
madzhidov said that tadzhikistans communist party leader 
kakhar makhkamov appeared before a crowd that gathered sunday 
outside party headquarters in dushanbe and asked for 24 hours to 
investigate rumors armenian refugees had been guaranteed housing in 
new suburbs while tadzhiks were kept waiting 
another crowd gathered on monday but ignored his report that 
all but one armenian refugee already had left dushanbe he said by 
telephone 
they pelted the party headquarters with stones breaking all the 
windows and then went on a rampage through shops located nearby 
he said 
police fired in the air to disperse the crowd but the rioting 
continued until armored vehicles brought soldiers into the city 
center madzhidov said 
families in tadzhikistan a small mountainous republic bordering 
china and afghanistan traditionally are large and there is a 
critical shortage of housing some of the mainly moslem tadzhiks 
also remain homeless after an earthquake in the republic in january 
1989 that killed scores of people

the house of delegates has given 
preliminary approval to a bill to restrict smoking despite some 
legislators fears of the political consequences in this 
tobaccogrowing state 
seldom in my career have i built my own political gallows and 
provided the rope delegate charles hawkins a republican from 
pittsylvania county said monday if i vote for this i might be 
doing that 
the bill which was passed in a voice vote monday and is due for 
a final house vote tuesday was approved over the objection of 
health lobbyists and legislators who backed a bill calling for 
stricter smoking regulation 
if its approved in the final house vote the bill would have to 
be reconciled with a more stringent bill recently approved by the 
senate 
were in a position to negotiate which is better than 
nothing said sen thomas j michie jr who sponsored the senate 
bill 
in addition to requiring nosmoking areas in government 
buildings the bills main impact would set standards for local 
nosmoking ordinances 
local governments would be allowed to demand nosmoking areas in 
restaurants and ban smoking in elevators schools indoor service 
lines and school buses 
but local ordinances could not regulate smoking in businesses 
with less than 10000 square feet of floor space socalled mom 
and pop stores nor could they regulate smoking in privately owned 
meeting rooms in theaters or on public transportation 
the bill also does not address smoking in private work areas 
a rejected rival bill similar to that already approved by the 
senate would have allowed workers to declare their areas 
smokefree by a twothirds vote

new american bar association resolutions 
passed over justice department objections would restrict the 
ability of federal investigators to subpoena lawyers or talk to 
their clients 
the resolutions dealing with the sensitive area of 
attorneyclient privilege were passed on voice votes monday at the 
abas midyear meeting in los angeles 
attorney general dick thornburgh dispatched deputy attorney 
general donald b ayer to appeal to the delegates to vote down the 
resolution but aba officials said the 11thhour lobbying came only 
after the justice department refused for more than a year to 
discuss the issues 
the resolutions were the result of increased concern among the 
nations lawyers that federal prosecutors and criminal 
investigators are violating the confidential relationship between 
attorneys and clients 
one resolution called for the justice department to obtain court 
approval before issuing grand jury subpoenas for attorneys 
such subpoenas must be authorized by senior justice department 
officials and have become more frequent over the last decade with 
the increased investigation of whitecollar crime and drug 
trafficking 
a second resolution criticized a memorandum issued last june by 
thornburgh that says federal prosecutors and agents investigating a 
case may talk to people represented by counsel without getting the 
permission of the lawyer 
the aba says this practice violates its model code of 
professional responsibility as well as many state and local bar 
ethics codes 
the attorney general disputed that and said the justice 
department would resist attempts by state and local bar groups to 
impose ethics regulations to curb legitimate federal law 
enforcement techniques 
thornburgh argued that the abas restrictive interpretation of 
the code of conduct could hamper legitimate law enforcement 
efforts such as contacts by justice department lawyers 
investigating procurement fraud and employees of defense 
contractors 
a restrictive application of these local bar rules would 
enable company counsel to control the governments access to the 
companys employees the attorney general wrote 
the aba report adopted along with the resolution said 
thornburghs policy presents a substantive and substantial threat 
to the administration of justice 
suffice it to say i dont agree with that characterization 
thornburgh told reporters in washington before the aba vote 
justice department spokesman david runkel said the resolutions 
would have no immediate impact and our views hold 
the justice department would wage a statebystate fight against 
any changes in the ethics code to inhibit federal prosecutors 
on the issue of attorney subpoenas ayer told delegates in a 
letter the resolution would substantially impede criminal 
investigations 
the more difficult we make it to obtain unprivileged 
information from attorneys the more criminal enterprises will seek 
out and hide behind unwitting or unscrupulous lawyers ayer wrote 
michael ross chairman of the abas grand jury section said the 
justice department sought a lastminute meeting to discuss the 
issue after refusing to do so for 18 months 
the war on drugs has convinced the government that the only 
constituency it has to answer to is the man on the street said 
ross a former federal prosecutor who practices criminal defense 
law in new york city 
the man on the street doesnt care about individual rights but 
cares about understandably the horrors that drugs bring with 
it he said 
clearly attorney subpoenas will not solve the drug problem 
ross said clearly ethics rules wont solve the drug problem 
but the guy on the street feels this is a gettough policy

fbi agents seized items that could be used to 
make a pipe bomb such as those that killed a federal judge and 
civil rights lawyer during a search of property owned by a man 
convicted 18 years ago of possessing a similar bomb a newspaper 
reported 
the atlanta constitution quoted federal sources it did not 
identify in todays editions as saying laboratory tests are pending 
to establish whether the items found on the property of walter 
leroy moody jr match the two bombs that exploded in december 
moody denied any connection with the bombs his lawyer said 
the bombs sent through the mail killed us circuit court judge 
robert vance in alabama and lawyer robert robinson of savannah ga 
two other bombs were safely intercepted 
investigators confiscated 2inch pipe sixpenny nails rubber 
bands alarm wire flashlight bulbs bolts paper clips 
gunpowderpacked bullets and welding machinery all similar to 
items used to make the mail bombs the newspaper said 
also seized were adhesives brown paper labels tape and 
old string the paper reported similar materials 
particularly a unique string that has not been manufactured for 
about seven years were used on the packages in which the four 
bombs were mailed 
the constitution in a story also copyrighted by the atlanta 
journal reported that agents seized the following 
seventeen 25cent flag over yosemite postage stamps in the 
pocketbook of susan mcbride who lives with moody that stamp was 
used on all four package bombs 
a desktop copier photocopied typewritten letters from a 
purported group calling itself americans for a competent federal 
judicial system were sent after the bombings 
highlighted newspaper clippings about the fbis investigation 
of robert wayne oferrell an enterprise ala junkstore owner 
whose home and business were searched last month and who has been 
questioned repeatedly oferrell denies any knowledge of the bomb 
attacks 
two typewriters that were examined on the scene and determined 
not to match the ones used by americans for a competent federal 
judicial system 
moody reached at his clayton county home referred inquiries to 
his attorney michael c ford 
i dont see anything there that i see as significant ford 
said of the seized items they found brown paper well i hope 
they dont search my office i probably have some of that too 
ford said two motions were filed in federal court monday seeking 
the return of moodys property and attacking the searches as 
faulty he said moody has no connection to the bomb attacks 
moody 55 a selfemployed literary consultant was convicted in 
1972 of possessing a pipe bomb that the newspapers sources said is 
very similar to the december package bombs he was acquitted on a 
charge of building the bomb which injured his thenwife hazel in 
their macon ga home 
in his appeals in that case court records show moody was 
extremely critical of the attorney judges and government agents 
associated with his case 
during an interview friday with wsbtv moody said 
criticizing the court is not an unhealthy practice i dont 
think i think its unhealthy when you say if you dont rule my 
way then im going to send you a bomb thats ridiculous 
moody served nearly three years in the atlanta federal 
penitentiary on the bomb possession conviction but maintains his 
innocence he is representing himself in asking the us supreme 
court to throw out his conviction after an 11th us circuit court 
of appeals panel denied his third appeal in june vance was not on 
that panel

retail sales driven by renewed automobile 
sales incentives climbed 16 percent in january the steepest 
increase in more than a year the government reported today 
the commerce department said sales increased to a seasonally 
adjusted 1464 billion after declining a revised 02 percent in 
december during what analysts described as modest holiday shopping 
the january gain was the sharpest since a 21 percent advance in 
october 1988 
december sales originally had been reported to have gained 02 
percent a drop in estimated auto sales accounted for the decline 
overall sales in november rose 07 percent 
retailing usually slows in january because of the previous 
months activity half or more of retail profits come from business 
between thanksgiving and christmas 
retail sales account for about onethird of the nations 
economic activity and thus are a barometer of economic growth the 
economy particularly the construction and manufacturing sectors 
has been squeezed by high interest rates as the federal reserve 
kept a tight rein on credit to cap inflation 
the automobile industry slowed by the high rates and rising 
prices on 1990 models reinstituted rebates on many models last 
month to lure buyers to dealer showrooms 
commerce said auto sales gained 54 percent in january after 
falling 26 percent in december it was the largest advance since a 
66 percent increase in october 1988 autos represent about 20 
percent of retail sales 
excluding autos retail sales for the month would have risen 06 
percent 
the overall durable goods category including cars and other 
bigticket items expected to last more than three years gained 
39 percent after declining 21 percent in december 
buildings materials advanced 23 percent while furniture and 
other home furnishings rose 2 percent 
sales of nondurable goods such as food and clothing edged up 
03 percent 
gains were posted by gasoline stations up 25 percent drug 
stores up 23 percent department stores up 22 percent and 
restaurants and bars up 15 percent 
declines included grocery stores down 04 percent and apparel 
down 07 percent 
for the three months from november through january overall 
retail sales were up 38 percent

a prominent surgeon who took exception to 
the us food and drug administrations disapproval of an 
artificial heart says a modified order allowing lastresort use may 
save lives 
fda officials are reasonable people i think they came up with 
a reasonable decision said dr jack g copeland who heads the 
heart transplant and artificial heart programs at university 
medical center 
last month the fda withdrew its approval for use of symbion 
incs total artificial heart both as a permanent implant and as a 
temporary bridge to transplantation saying there were serious 
deficiencies with its manufacture the federal agency also 
withdrew its approval for use of the tempe ariz companys acute 
ventricular assist device 
the artificial heart was developed by dr robert jarvik and 
initially was called the jarvik7 jarvik no longer is associated 
with symbion which markets the artificial heart as the symbion7 
the university said in a statement monday that the fda will 
not object to the use of the symbion devices as a last resort after 
all alternative treatments with commercially available or approved 
investigational products have failed or are determined to be 
inappropriate for the conditions to be treated and when no other 
lifesaving device is available to save the life of the patient 
richard alder president and chief executive officer of symbion 
confirmed monday night that the fda would permit lastresort 
livesaving uses under certain very prescribed conditions 
the change was outlined in a letter the agency sent fairly 
recently to organizations that had been using the devices on an 
investigatory basis he said 
alder said symbion and fda officials were setting up meetings to 
try to resolve remaining issues involved in last months action 
in response to the fdas announcement last month copeland said 
that if the need arose he might defy the ban 
copeland said then the effect of withdrawing the symbion devices 
would be to deprive potentially hundreds of critically ill 
patients of a chance for life 
on monday copeland said were pleased that the fda and 
symbion have opened a dialogue and we hope that there is a mutually 
agreeable solution soon 
copeland said he had called fda officials as an individual 
physician after its initial letter and told them now were in 
limbo again every time we put this device in somebodys gonna say 
that were defying the fda and we know scientifically that theyre 
good devices 
i felt that it was an untenable position they were putting us 
into copeland said fda officials told him they thought i had a 
point

under pressure from the auto and petroleum 
industries the bush administration is backing away from a proposal 
that would require millions of alternative fuel cars to be sold in 
cities most plagued by smog 
the phasing in of cars powered by fuels such as methanol or 
natural gas was a centerpiece of president bushs clean air 
proposal last summer the white house envisioned use of up to 1 
million such vehicles annually by 1997 in an attempt to reconcile 
the automobile to the environment 
but william reilly head of the environmental protection agency 
acknowledged monday that the administration no longer considers 
mandatory production of alternative fuel cars as an essential part 
of clean air legislation 
instead the administration is proposing in negotiations with 
senate leaders that reformulated gasoline which also cuts 
pollution would be welcomed as an alternative to the alternative 
fuel vehicles 
the atlantic richfield co is already starting to put 
reformulated gasoline into pumps in southern california in an 
attempt to reduce smogcausing emissions 
unlike alternative fuel cars vehicles using reformulated 
gasoline do not require any additional equipment or modifications 
because the pollutants are removed from the fuel itself in the 
refining process 
there is no change in the goals or the performance objectives 
that we want to achieve but we have tried to indicate more 
flexibility about methods of getting there reilly told a group 
of reporters 
for example he said a city that has been unable to meet air 
quality requirements still would have to achieve certain annual 
reductions in smogcausing pollution but that might be achieved by 
having all cars use reformulated gasoline instead of having 30 
percent of the cars powered on alternative fuels as was envisioned 
under the original proposal 
reilly conceded the proposal requiring automakers to build a 
specific number of alternative fuel cars has caused us 
considerable opposition and kept some senators from supporting 
the administrations clean air proposal 
we have been willing for some months to redraft some language 
on the alternative fuels to try to reassure people that we do 
not prefer one fuel over another said reilly 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
but in a speech prepared for delivery to a trade conference in 
scottsdale ariz an epa supporter of alternative fuels said they 
offer the only hope for severely polluted cities 
if you dont have clean alternative fuels forget about 
attainment said charles l gray director of the epas emission 
control technology division in ann arbor mich 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
neither the house nor senate clean air bills include a 
requirement for alternative fuel cars instead the senate bill 
would impose a second round of automobile tailpipe emission 
controls which the auto industry and the white house have 
vigorously opposed 
in negotiations with senate leaders the bush administration has 
sought to substitute its proposal including an option for using 
reformulated gasoline for the second round of tailpipe controls 
some senate democrats have expressed frustration in recent days 
over the changes in the administrations alternative fuels 
proposal maintaining that although the white house opposes the 
second round of tailpipe controls it is now offering a substitute 
that is weaker than what bush called for last summer 
that original proposal envisioned phasing in a 30 percent use of 
alternative fueled cars in heavily polluted cities or more than 1 
million cars by 1997 
at a white house ceremony june 12 bush called the alternative 
fuels program a bold new initiative to reconcile the automobile 
to the environment 
but automakers and the petroleum industry have waged strong 
lobbying campaigns against the alternative fuel proposal the oil 
companies expedited introduction of the reformulated gasoline and 
have argued it is a better way to reduce smog than shifting to 
fuels such as methanol or natural gas 
the car manufacturers said they were worried customers might not 
buy so many alternative fuel cars and have argued against the 
government mandating production and sale of such vehicles

prime minister margaret thatcher is proposing a 
bigpower conference with the two germanys to work out a framework 
for german reunification government sources said today 
she wants the united states soviet union britain and france 
the original occupiers of germany after world war ii to meet at 
foreignminister level with representatives of east and west 
germany said the sources at her downing street headquarters they 
spoke on condition they not be identified 
foreign secretary douglas hurd drew up a detailed proposal and 
discussed it with britains allies at this weeks eastwest open 
skies conference in canada of 23 nations the sources said 
the proposal is expected to be amplified when mrs thatcher 
meets foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of west germany in 
london on wednesday genscher asked for the meeting the sources 
said 
they said no date was being set for the conference but it was 
hoped it would take place soon after east germanys march 18 
elections 
any formulas agreed upon would then be presented to the 
35nation conference on security and cooperation in europe 
mrs thatchers proposal is seen as a response to critics who 
accuse her of seeking to slow the momentum toward reunification 
the british leader has not disguised her concern that hasty moves 
could undermine european security 
on saturday at a meeting of her conservative party mrs 
thatcher stressed that the 1975 helsinki agreement stipulated that 
no boundaries would be changed except by agreement 
so if any boundaries are to be changed this requires massive 
consultation between us she said 
all this means the changes they are having now in germany and 
moves towards unification must be done in accord with the other 
obligations to which we signed up 
the daily mail which first carried the report today said the 
conference could produce an agreement tantamount to a german 
peace treaty 
no peace treaty was signed after world war ii and although the 
united states britain and france renounced their status as 
occupiers in 1955 they retain authority in berlin and maintain 
armies in west germany 
the daily mail said mrs thatchers proposal was a way of 
saying lets be practical and settle the complex problems at the 
conference table rather than through demonstrations in the 
streets

nearly 300 military officers demanding 
the resignations of the defense and interior ministers protested 
silently today outside government headquarters on victory square 
the uniformed officers from the army navy and air force said 
they wanted to replace the incumbents with people untainted by 
decembers revolution or by long association with ousted communist 
dictator nicolae ceausescu 
defense minister gen nicolae militaru held a series of high 
army posts before being demoted and pensioned off by ceausescu who 
was ousted dec 22 and executed three days later along with his 
wife elena 
militaru came out of retirement during the revolution and was 
named minister of defense by interim president ion iliescu 
interior minister gen mihai chitac is a former commander of 
chemical warfare troops the officers cited unconfirmed rumors that 
chitac shot demonstrators in the western city of timisoara where 
the revolution began 
some 700 regular soldiers from valea jiului in southwest romania 
also demonstrated in the square demanding that they be released 
from the army 
another group of 100 workers shouting where are our 
rights also demonstrated for changes in working conditions and 
higher salaries 
the protests took place as romanias new coalition government 
held its second meeting the agenda included discussions on the 
governments precise role and a report from prime minister petre 
roman on the state of romanias battered economy 
in its first order of business the national council which 
counts more than 250 members agreed to limit speeches to three 
minutes leaders of the major opposition parties threatened monday 
to pull out of the council if the previously dominant national 
salvation front that took power in the december revolution does not 
stop what it called manipulation of the new body 
one major charge against the front which has said it will 
contest the free elections may 20 against the other weaker 
opposition parties has been its control of radio and television 
andits alleged refusal to allow other parties access to the media 
an air force officer said today that as long as iliescu 
chooses to have people next to him like exgenerals we do not 
agree with him he said the air force had good untainted 
officers who could replace the old generals 
a pilot said the officers were very angry that the pilot who 
flew the helicopter in which ceausescu fled bucharest on dec 22 
identified in press reports only as lt col malutan was not 
dismissed and instead promoted to full colonel 
malutan was quoted in news reports as saying he deliberately 
flew low in order to be detected by radar and prevent ceausescu 
from escaping

the people of dresden today 
recalled the devastating allied bombing raids 45 years ago that 
killed 35000 and leveled one of germanys most important cultural 
centers 
the ceremonies were the first not rigidly directed by communist 
leaders who traditionally had used the observances as a forum for 
bitter attacks on the west 
public officials and citizens led by city mayor wolfgang 
berghofer placed wreaths and flowers at a memorial cemetery where 
29000 victims of the attack many of them women children and old 
people lay buried 
the mourners stood before a simple memorial plaque engraved with 
the words of an unknown writer how many died who knows the 
number in your wounds one sees the agony of the nameless that were 
burned to death here in a hellfire started by human hands 
many victims burned beyond recognition or crushed in cellars of 
bombed buildings were never identified 
the dresden bombings are described vividly in the popular novel 
slaughterhouse five by kurt vonnegut jr 
while east germanys official news agency adn today said 35000 
had died in the bombings other estimates put the number far 
higher the actual figure is still a point of controversy 
the bombing raids conducted by british and american forces 
remain controversial to this day east germans along with others 
argue that the intensity of the attack was not necessary militarily 
similar observances some including readings of eyewitness 
accounts of the attack took place at other cemeteries and sites 
associated with the bombing several of the citys historical 
buildings have been reconstructed 
several representatives from dresdens partner cities throughout 
the world also joined in the observances 
dresden authorities were determined to avoid the communist show 
and propaganda that characterized dresden observances in the past 
according to a feb 10 report in the munichbased sueddeutsche 
zeitung 
participation of the people who live here is voluntary there 
will be no ordered delegations the newspaper quoted a dresden 
city press spokesman as saying

prime minister yitzhak shamir today moved to 
reconcile hardline and moderate opponents in his likud bloc after 
a party meeting ended in chaos and trade minister ariel sharon 
threatened to leave the cabinet 
there was confusion inside the rightwing party and political 
observers were divided about whether shamir or sharon had emerged 
victorious from the stormy session monday 
there is a lot of time for maneuvering because by israeli law a 
resignation has to be formally announced by a minister at a cabinet 
session then a resignation letter is submitted to the premier 
and it takes effect only 48 hours later 
party activists today tried to persuade sharon the former 
defense minister and architect of israels 1982 lebanon invasion 
to withdraw his letter of resignation 
sharon told israel radio he had no plans to retract his threat 
he also left a door open to compromise he noted that he had quit 
on principle and i would prefer certainly to stay in the 
government 
the impact on middle east peace efforts of sharons resignation 
and of the chaotic likud central committee meeting also remained 
uncertain 
sharons departure from the cabinet could remove an obstacle to 
ussponsored efforts to start peace talks with palestinians 
since he is the ringleader of the hardline camp 
but shamir trying to hold the party together at the meeting 
restated his opposition to at least some usbacked compromises 
for starting peace talks 
labor party chief shimon peres said of shamirs speech i 
dont think that this was a great contribution to the peace 
process labor is likuds partner in the coaltion government and 
advocates compromise with the arabs 
sharon had protested the governments failure to end the 
26month palestinian uprising and ensure permanent israeli rule in 
all of jerusalem including the arab eastern sector that was 
annexed after the 1967 middle east war 
the 90minute session in tel aviv broke up about an hour later 
after sharon interrupted an attempt by shamir to win a show of 
support for his peace initiative the plan calls for elections 
among palestinians in the occupied lands 
hundreds of arms went up in shamirs support but sharon shouted 
into a microphone who is for liquidating terror 
his supporters responded with cries of arik arik sharons 
nickname 
both leaders claimed they won and shamir walked out 
after a twohour coolingoff period shamir held a 
reconciliation meeting with key sharon backer and deputy premier 
david levy who is a leading contender for party leader after 
shamir 
winning levys support or neutralizing his backing for sharon 
could significantly enhance shamirs image 
the moroccanborn levy a former construction worker is a 
representative of the largely disadvantaged sephardic community of 
middle eastern and african jews a major power base of likud 
levy planned to meet today with sharon and his supporters to 
persuade him to stay in the cabinet officials said 
while the chaos seemed almost normal for israeli politics some 
politicians and editorial writers expressed worry over the disorder 
in likud and the uncertainty over who rules the party 
a body that cannot rule itself will find it hard to rule the 
state said mordechai gur a labor member 
the conservative maariv daily wrote that israels image was 
hurt badly by what happened yesterday and israel has enough 
problems already

a decade after embarking on a 
comprehensive study of acid rain scientists say theres no quick 
fix for the pollution that can despoil mountain lakes and kill 
towering trees 
but scientists from around the word who gathered here to review 
the research were told monday their work has brought the problem 
into better focus 
about 700 scientists from 35 nations are meeting this week at a 
conference sponsored by the national acid precipitation assessment 
program 
the agency was established a decade ago by congress and has 
spent 500 million investigating the problem 
at that time some people wanted to declare a national emergency 
because of acid rain said john knauss undersecretary of commerce 
for oceans and atmosphere others wanted to do nothing 
the former group those who feared the worst was convinced 
that a 10year research program was simply an excuse for postponing 
immediate action he said the latter was convinced that 
spending so much on what they saw as a nonproblem was a waste of 
precious research dollars 
today there are few left who feel we need to declare a 
national emergency just as there are few who consider acid 
deposition a nonproblem he said 
acid rain is a combination of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide 
that mixes in the atmosphere and can fall as rain snow fog and 
dust particles it can make lakes and streams acidic and can kill 
trees 
the assessment program has compiled 28 reports comprising about 
15000 pages on the causes and extent of acid rain the documents 
include no recommendations and scientists were told monday there is 
no simple answer 
the full story is seldom if ever known about the complex 
issues of environmental science said william rosenberg an 
assistant administrator for the environmental protection agency

english cricket team was sharply curtailed today under an agreement 
with antiapartheid groups organizers said 
the south african cricket union agreed to cancel the teams 
match against the south african national team and cut the english 
sides remaining schedule from eight to four matches 
the team has play four matches since arriving last month in 
defiance of an international sports ban 
the antiapartheid national sports congress say it had agreed to 
end protests in return the national sports congress has agreed 
to withdraw protest action said nsc general secretary krish 
naidoo 
antiapartheid activists have demonstrated at all of the teams 
matches often leading to confrontations with police 
demonstrations have also been staged at hotels where the english 
team have stayed 
police said the decision to curtail the tour was totally 
unnecessary a statement said authorities had been able to 
control protests against the tour 
the south african cricket union which arranged the tour said 
it was cutting the schedule because of recent political 
developments it is our duty as responsible sports administrators 
to be sensitive to wider interests the union said 
it apologized to cricket lovers and promised refunds to 
people who had purchased tickets for the canceled matches 
english team captain mike gatting had no immediate comment 
the english team defied an international ban on sports contacts 
with south africa because of its apartheid policies the english 
players are receiving 160000 for the tour with gatting getting 
320000 according to local press reports 
naidoo said he hoped the compromise would help end apartheid in 
sport and promote mixed black and white teams 
but the antiapartheid group regrets that the tour was started 
in the first place and against all advice naidoo said

federal prosecutors have dropped the final 
charge against a panamanian industrialist whose drug arrest 
reportedly halted us covert financial support of panamanian 
opposition politicians 
us attorney edgar w ennis jr said monday he asked us 
district judge wilbur d owens to dismiss money laundering charges 
against carlos eleta almaran because there was not enough evidence 
to convict him two cocaine conspiracy charges were dropped in 
january for the same reason he said 
eleta 71 initially was billed by drug agents as the head of a 
conspiracy to smuggle 1320 pounds of cocaine a month into macon 
and launder drug profits through dummy corporations eleta and two 
of his countrymen were arrested april 6 1989 after a fivemonth 
investigation by the us drug enforcement administration 
manuel castillo bourcy 58 a former ambassador to belize and 
juan karamanites 35 pleaded guilty last fall but signed 
affidavits saying eleta had no knowledge of the conspiracy 
eletas arrest abruptly ended a us covert operation to help 
political opponents of thenpanamanian leader manuel antonio 
noriega the new york times has reported 
the times quoting unidentified federal officials said eletas 
arrest surprised the cia which it said had been relying on him to 
funnel money to noriegas opponents 
the charges against eleta disturbed members of congressional 
intelligence committees and caused the cia to halt its program 
the times reported 
noriega was ousted in the us invasion of panama last month 
ennis issued a statement saying the charges were dropped when 
it became apparent that it would be in keeping with castillos 
character to attempt to ride upon the prominence of carlos eleta to 
serve his own ends and that he could have done so without full 
knowledge on eletas part 
eletas lawyer greg craig of washington said his client was 
gratified by the decision 
carlos eleta trusted a friend who didnt deserve his trust and 
helped a friend who didnt deserve his help craig said 
eleta has been free on 3 million bail and living in miami 
awaiting his feb 20 trial

the solidarityled government will replace 
19 ambassadors appointed by previous communist governments a 
newspaper and sources said today 
among the ambassadors being recalled are the envoys to 
czechoslovakia and east germany where leadership has changed from 
hardline communists to proreform democrats during the past four 
months the prosolidarity daily gazeta wyborcza said 
a source in the foreign ministry who asked not to be identified 
by name told the associated press that more than 19 ambassadors 
would be replaced 
prominent among them are those who came to this service from 
outside from the socalled nomenklatura party elite who were 
not so well prepared to be ambassadors he said 
but he said that in an ordinary year 25 to 30 ambassadors are 
replaced so this is not so unusual 
ambassador jerzy kuberski the envoy to the vatican appointed in 
july when diplomatic relations between poland and the holy see were 
established for the first time in 50 years is among those being 
changed according to gazeta wyborcza 
the newspaper also mentioned the ambassador to prague former 
politburo member wlodzimierz mokrzyszczak and the ambassador to 
east berlin former deputy prime minister janusz obodowski as 
being called back to warsaw 
other prominent appointees from the previous power structure who 
are being called back include former politburo members tadeusz 
porebski and gen jozef baryla from yugoslavia and syria 
respectively said gazeta wyborcza 
in most cases the recalled ambassadors are ordered to return to 
poland by the end of march gazeta wyborcza reported 
under previous communist governments ambassadorships were often 
given to senior party officials after they were retired from the 
politburo central committee or as party secretaries 
technically president wojciech jaruzelski the longtime 
communist party leader is in charge of appointing and dismissing 
ambassadors but jaruzelski has been following the recommendations 
of the solidarityled government which then must be approved by 
the parliament foreign affairs committees 
solidarity activist tadeusz mazowiecki became prime minister in 
august and his foreign minister krzysztof skubiszewski was 
confirmed in september 
skubiszewski told the newspaper rzeczpospolita last month that 
he wanted slow and gradual change in the diplomatic corps 
i prefer to spend more time looking for candidates in order to 
find really good candidates he said

a judge has assessed 210000 in punitive 
damages against two men who failed to convince a jury that their 
employer ordered them to perform hundreds of illegal wiretaps 
hamilton county common pleas judge fred j cartolano ordered the 
assessments monday against former cincinnati bell telephone co 
employees leonard gates and robert draise 
you have to be punished cartolano said i dont think you 
two have that much in assets but i think you should be made an 
example for others 
a jury found that gates and draise had defamed cincinnati bell 
its parent company cincinnati bell inc and company supervisors 
with their wiretap claims jurors awarded 110000 in compensatory 
damages and said the judge should add punitive damages because 
gates and draise recklessly disregarded the truth in their 
accusations 
after the jury announced its verdict on jan 23 cartolano said 
he too had concluded that gates and draise lied 
cartolano said the law allows him to use punitive damages as 
both a punishment and as a deterrent although he acknowledged that 
the amount might not be collectible he added it is not my job 
to collect the damages 
gates and draise testified monday that they are out of work 
deeply in debt and have only a few hundred dollars in available 
cash during their eightweek trial they represented themselves 
because they said they could not afford lawyers 
the two men claimed they wiretapped more than 1200 telephones 
between the early 1970s and 1984 on orders from cincinnati police 
and bell security supervisors james west and peter gabor 
they claimed the taps were placed on the phones of various 
community leaders reporters criminal suspects a federal judge 
and president ford during a 1975 visit 
several past and present police officers admitted using the two 
men for about a dozen illegal taps in the early 1970s 
but the police said bell supervisors were not involved bell 
west and gabor denied any knowledge or participation in such 
activities 
phone company lawyers contended the two men were seeking revenge 
because bell fired draise in 1979 and gates in 1986 
bell spokeswoman cynthia cantoni said the company was pleased 
with the judges ruling and that the fact that damages were 
assessed was more important than the dollar amounts 
gates and draise stuck by their stories and said they are 
raising money to pay for an appeal 
we are not surprised at anything the public knows the 
wiretapping happened gates said 
several alleged victims of wiretapping are suing police and the 
city of cincinnati the case is scheduled to go to trial feb 20 in 
us district court

soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
urged the united states to expand its proposal on military 
surveillance flights to include sea and space but the bush 
adminstration rejected the idea 
shevardnadze pushed the proposal monday at the outset of a 
meeting of the 23 members of nato and the warsaw pact on allowing 
the alliances to make unarmed reconnaisance flights over member 
countries 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher opened 
todays session by hailing the open skies idea saying i am 
convinced that this openness and cooperation will increasingly 
become the natural form of relationship in europe and north amera 
on monday shevardnadze and secretary of state james a baker 
iii broke with the recent trend of softspoken reconciliation 
leveling criticism at each others stances on arms control 
in calling for expanding open skies surveillance to the seas 
and space shevardnadze said sealaunched nuclear missiles are the 
darkest corner of arms control efforts there can never be 
too much verification he said 
us officials dismissed the idea telling reporters in a 
separate briefing that washington was not interested in a naval 
arms control agreement and that surveillance flights already are 
allowed over oceans and in space 
soviet deputy foreign minister victor karpov later reiterated 
the soviet position and also said that the six warsaw pact 
countries would like to share information and planes in a common 
open skies fleet 
the open skies plan part of an idea first proposed in the 
1950s was revived by president bush in may the plan has been 
promoted as a confidencebuilding measure and both alliances have 
agreed to it in principle 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of west germany told 
reporters monday that he did not consider differing positions 
obstacles to a pact and that both sides hope for final agreement 
by midyear 
the open skies plan is not linked to any other treaty 
negotiations but the gathering in ottawa has provided the first 
forum for facetoface meetings since us and soviet leaders 
proposed deeper troop cuts in europe 
hardline communist leaders have been thrown out of office in 
nearly every warsaw pact country since bush made the open skies 
proposal 
it potentially is the most ambitious measure to build 
confidence that we have ever taken baker said at mondays 
opening session 
we believe it can build confidence and predictability 
shevardnadze said in his opening statement 
both sides expressed hope that countries outside nato and the 
warsaw pact eventually would become part of an open skies pact 
nato has said each alliance should make its surveillance flights 
separately and share data only within their blocs although 
countries being surveyed would be allowed to inspect aircraft 
before flights 
karpov said monday that the warsaw pact countries were aligned 
behind the soviet position of shared data and shared flights but 
he held out the possibility of compromise the common fleet idea 
was not contained in the warsaw pacts working proposal for the 
conference he said 
both sides are looking for a common ground karpov said 
most smaller countries welcome the open skies plan because they 
lack the satellite technology to conduct surveillance on their own 
and depend on their larger us or soviet partners for intelligence 
shevardnadze and baker strayed from the main topic when they 
began criticizing elements of each others positions on arms 
control 
in pushing for greater monitoring of weapons at sea and 
potential weapons in space shevardnadze criticized the united 
states for excluding naval forces from disarmament talks and for 
seeking through development of star wars to put nuclear weapons 
in space that would block a missile attack 
let us face the truth shevardnadze said today the 
easiest way to launch a surprise attack a military invasion or an 
aggression is from the seas 
baker meanwhile said positions taken by moscow on troops and 
aircraft still stand in the way of completing a treaty this year to 
limit nonnuclear forces 
he criticized soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev for rejecting a 
proposal by bush that would permit the united states to keep a 
total of 30000 troops in britain italy and spain while both sides 
maintain 195000 troops in central europe 
gorbachev had countered with ceilings of 225000 soviet troops 
to 195000 us soldiers on foreign soil throughout europe that 
would in effect prevent a us numerical edge because the soviets 
could offset in central europe any americans stationed elsewhere on 
the continent 
bush said monday that he stood by his plan but told reporters in 
washington that he expected a major success on arms control at 
junes superpower summit in the united states 
the first two days of the threeweek open skies conference are 
dedicated to meetings of foreign ministers lowerlevel officials 
then will take over the talks with the aim of having a document 
ready to sign by midyear at a second conference in hungary

george bush is no stranger to danger in 
colombia 
eight years ago as vice president he escaped an apparent 
assassination plot in which a load of dynamite was buried under the 
lone runway at the bogota international airport 
the explosives were found hours after bushs plane took off 
only then did security officials discover the dynamite connected to 
wires running to an electrical generator 300 yards away 
defense ministry officials theorized that leftist guerrillas 
rigged the dynamite in the days before bush arrived but apparently 
were unable to sneak back into the area the day of the flight 
because the army had sealed off the airport 
the 1982 incident provides a sharp reminder of the risks bush 
faces as he prepares to fly to colombia on thursday for a sixhour 
drug summit with the presidents of colombia peru and bolivia 
colombian authorities say about 5000 security agents will be 
deployed when the leaders meet at a heavily guarded naval base near 
the coastal resort of cartagena 
aside from the ground forces us warplanes may be used to 
escort air force one and bushs helicopter in addition us 
warships likely will be stationed in the caribbean 
its an unusual situation because there are in colombia these 
guerrilla bands terrorist bands with access to funds to purchase 
any kinds of arms and so naturally there are unusual 
circumstances brent scowcroft the white house national security 
adviser said today 
however he said were comfortable about the presidents 
security all the agencies involved in presidential security are 
comfortable with the arrangements 
its a serious environment to deal with said william a 
hawthorne who retired from the secret service in 1987 as executive 
assistant to the director 
the fact that theyre going tells me the secret service 
believes they can provide security in that environment im not 
particularly worried hawthorne said 
bush expressing confidence about his security says he wants to 
go to colombia as an expression of support for its president 
virgilio barco who is waging war against the countrys drug lords 
jerry parr head of president reagans protective detail said 
that on a scale of 1 to 10 the danger to bush is probably a 
seven or an eight 
its risky to be president said parr who in 1981 shoved a 
wounded reagan into a limousine and rushed him to a hospital after 
an assassination attempt you cant reduce all the risks 
typically he said the secret service sets up three concentric 
rings of security for the president an intensely guarded inner 
circle a middle circle and an outer perimeter 
the whole game will be to minimize the danger and reduce the 
killers or the assassins options parr said 
decoy limousines and helicopters have become standard fare in 
presidential security last week in san francisco a decoy 
motorcade of a half dozen cars fooled raucous demonstrators who 
were trying to haze the president 
the secret service also can change travel routes and arrival 
areas and stage diversions and distractions former agents say 
theres going to be some razzle dazzle so people arent quite 
clear about who to attack said chuck vance who helped guard 
president ford and served on two vice presidential protective 
details 
theyll have military personnel everywhere frogmen ships 
aircraft vance said i called in a whole naval fleet one 
time in a moroccan visit for vice president spiro agnew because 
of political uncertainties 
the secret service wont discuss its security precautions or the 
threat potential to bush 
do the redskins send their playbook to dallas the week 
before asked robert snow head of public affairs for the secret 
service 
we feel we can do what we have to do he said were still 
assessing it every day its not a done deal until we go at this 
point its an hour by hour day by day evaluation 
vance said he considered a direct attack against bush unlikely 
they drug lords could make a point for a moment but the 
retaliation would be so severe he said i think you may see 
some bombings elsewhere to show their displeasure and show they 
have the ability to do something 
you prepare for the worst and hope for the best parr quoted 
secret service director john simpson as saying

a military court today convicted a 
former lieutenant colonel of leading a 1987 coup attempt against 
president corazon aquino and sentenced him to 12 years at hard 
labor 
former philippine constabulary lt col reynaldo cabauatan was 
found guilty of mutiny on april 18 1987 when rebellious troops 
stormed the army headquarters in suburban fort bonifacio the 
mutineers seized some 50 hostages in a bid to free other rebels 
jailed for a failed coup the previous january 
troops loyal to the late president ferdinand marcos seized a tv 
station and raided at least two surburban military bases in the 
jan 27 1987 rebellion which ended after 61 hours when holdouts 
in the television station surrendered 
the court cleared cabauatan of involvement in the january revolt 
due to conflicting testimony by prosecution witnesses the 
prosecution claimed cabuatan led soldiers from a province north of 
manila to reinforce the rebels in the station but his troops were 
intercepted by loyal soldiers at a highway several miles away 
cabauatan wearing a traditional filipino formal shirt appeared 
unmoved as the verdict was read his wife cried loudly and his 
mother fainted as relatives and friends embraced him after the 
brief proceedings 
his 43 coconspirators in the april 1987 revolt were acquitted 
by the same court last year 
cabauatans lawyers said they would appeal todays verdict 
his conviction came two months after the aquino government 
crushed the dec 19 coup attempt the sixth and most serious bid 
by rightwing military officers to topple mrs aquino

575 million in fines 
known throughout the south for his unorthodox weight loss

a us presidential panel today 
reiterated suspicions that the bomb that blew up pan am flight 103 
originated in west germany but said security has improved at 
frankfurt airport since the attack 
president bush created the commission on aviation security and 
terrorism last august as a direct result of the dec 21 1988 
bombing of pan am flight 103 over lockerbie scotland 
the sevenmember panel is examining options for improving 
airport security to prevent a similar attack the bombing killed 
all 259 people aboard the jumbo jet and 11 on the ground 
commission members spoke to reporters at frankfurt airport 
where they had looked into security measures 
rep james oberstar dminn said that in an official visit to 
frankfurt airport last june he noticed there were still security 
deficiencies despite the flight 103 bombing the illfated flight 
originated in frankfurt although it changed planes in london 
my impression then was security was diffuse too 
decentralized there were too many opportunities for intervention 
terrorism he said 
but since then better security measures have been put into 
place at frankfurt airport oberstar said 
theres closer coordination among the levels of government 
there seems to be better baggage control there seems to be better 
baggagepassenger matching and their technology has improved 
there have been allegations that lax security allowed the bomb 
to be placed on board flight 103 at frankfurt airport but west 
german investigators have insisted there is no proof the bomb 
originated here 
but the head of the presidential commission former us labor 
secretary ann mclaughlin insisted that theory remains a strong 
possibility 
she said that as one looks at the variety of theories that 
one certainly has merit but it would not be up to me to suggest 
thats a final decision 
another commission member sen frank lautenberg dnj said 
one key reason the panel came to frankfurt airport was to see 
where the hitch was that permitted this bombing to happen 
none of the commission members however said they had any final 
proof the bomb originated in frankfurt 
ms mclaughlin said the panel would likely present its 
recommendations to bush in midmay 
she would not detail what any of these suggestions might be but 
said they would include the areas of prior notification to the 
general public about terrorist threats and improving airport and 
airline security

the paper industry announced tuesday that is 
setting a goal of 40 percent paper recycling by 1995 
the us paper industry is committed to being part of the 
solid waste solution said red cavaney president of the american 
paper institute 
but he added in a statement it will require the cooperation 
of the public sector and the participation of tens of millions of 
citizens in order to expand collection systems 
with total paper use expected to be just over 100 million tons 
by 1995 that would represent a recycling goal of 40 million tons 
according to figures supplied by the institute the trade 
association for makers of pulp paper and paperboard 
that much recycling would represent an increase of more than 50 
percent from the 26 million tons recycled in 1988 the institute 
reported 
cavaney said the industry will establish a computerized system 
to help communities that undertake recycling programs to find 
markets for the paper they collect 
the paper industry has begun an expansion program to provide 
more plants to handle the recycling he said and public service 
campaigns will be launched to encourage conservation 
to reach the goal of recycling 40 percent of all paper an 
industry study said that recycling would need to cover 
more than 50 percent of newspapers one area where recycling is 
currently common about 35 percent of newspapers are now recycled 
recycling of about 66 percent of old cardboard boxes 
about 50 percent of printing plant scrap and sorted white 
office paper 
some 20 percent of mixed papers mixed papers are collected 
unsorted from offices and contain a wide mariety of materials

the united states has completed withdrawal of 
its military force that invaded panama on dec 20 the white house 
said today 
the us troop strength in panama is at 13504 below the 13597 
stationed in the central american nation before the invasion said 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater 
more than 14000 troops had been rushed from bases in the united 
states for the invasion 
while the troop levels have fluctuated by a few thousand over 
recent years the 13000 level is considered in the normal range 
he said that includes however the 2000 extra personnel 
president bush sent to panama following an election last may 7 that 
was invalidated by nowdeposed gen manuel antonio noriega 
the efforts of all the us military personnel in panama were 
key to helping put panama on the road to democracy fitzwater 
told reporters the president commends the efforts of these brave 
men and women their task is something of which all men and women 
should be proud 
the panama invasion resulted in the combat deaths of 23 us 
soldiers and the wounding of 324 with 314 panamanian troops killed 
and 124 wounded according to pentagon figures in addition 202 
civilians were killed in the fighting 
the united states has no plans to withdraw its permanent force 
in panama however the troops are shifting their emphasis from the 
traditional one of concentrating on the panama canal to help train 
a new national police force for panama 
noriegas panamanian defense force was effectively put out of 
business by the invasion and his ouster but thousands of its 
members have signed up for the new police force 
fitzwater said the number of us troops will likely continue to 
fluctuate in the years to come 
presence of the invasion force was a thorn in the side of 
panamas latin american neighbors who saw the invasion as an 
unwarranted use of us muscle 
president alan garcia of peru initially said he would not attend 
this thursdays drug summit in colombia with president bush as long 
as the invasion troops remained 
last week however as the us troop withdrawal continued he 
announced he would attend

east german and west german leaders 
today agreed to start talks on a common currency as early as next 
week but set no target date for monetary union because of east 
germanys resistance to capitalist reforms 
west german chancellor helmut kohl said at a joint news 
conference with east german premier hans modrow that the two had 
agreed to form a committee to examine how the west german mark can 
become the east german currency 
but the talks will only consider economic union in principle 
because prodemocracy forces and rival political parties have 
effectively forbidden modrow to commit east germany to the currency 
union plan proposed by kohl 
bonn again rejected an east german appeal for immediate 
financial aid of as much as 9 billion until an elected government 
is in power in east berlin 
east germans go to the polls for their first free elections on 
march 18 and the absence of an elected leadership is stalling 
recovery efforts 
kohls government does not want to loan huge sums to an east 
german leadership that is expected to be voted out of office in 
less than five weeks the uncertainties meanwhile continue to 
fuel the exodus of east germans to the west kohl disclosed that 
85000 east germans have resettled in west germany over the past 
six weeks 
modrow said before his oneonone talks with kohl that he was 
not authorized to approve measures toward monetary union during his 
twoday visit here 
east german political leaders have rejected bonns call for 
making the powerful west german mark the official currency in their 
troubled nation fearing that west germany is pushing the 
reunification process too quickly 
monetary union would be contingent on a wholesale conversion of 
the east german economy to market principles 
west german leaders consider a common currency the only means of 
giving east germans immediate confidence in their future 
the decision to form a joint committee will allow preliminary 
work toward monetary union to begin despite east germanys 
position on the issue but some west germans have predicted that 
the east german economy could collapse before the elections 
in the east german city of leipzig on monday night 
demonstrators demanded an immediate currency union or said they 
would leave for west germany joining an estimated 2000 daily who 
have left for the west 
modrow was accompanied by 17 cabinet members and at least 10 
other experts and advisers for the talks aimed at determining how 
the two nations should eventually be reunified and how east 
germany can be kept financially afloat in the meantime 
kohl and modrow agree that unification is the only means of 
rescuing the east german economy and providing higher living 
standards for those in the east 
washington and moscow have given their blessing to eventual 
reunification 
kohl returned from weekend talks with gorbachev saying a 
unification plan would likely be ready with the agreement of the 
four victorious world war ii allies before the year was out 
but the east germans could slow the pace of reunification with 
their rejection of west germanys idea of quickly setting up a 
monetary union 
another disagreement likely to arise during modrows visit was 
whether a united germany should belong to any military bloc 
modrow says a united germany should be neutral but also has 
signaled he would be willing to talks about some other arrangement 
which he has not disclosed 
kohl has said repeatedly that west germany is firmly embedded in 
the north atlantic treaty organization and with the united states 
has rejected neutrality for a united germany 
his foreign minister hansdietrich genscher says the soviets 
are studying several possibilities for the military posture of 
a united germany without specifying them the soviet union has 
about 380000 troops in east germany 
kohl proposed the idea of monetary union as a means of trying to 
rescue the east german economy hemorrhaging from an exodus of 
workers to west germany 
the exodus is also harming west germany seriously straining its 
housing and job markets and its social services

president bush is likely to propose at the 
upcoming drug summit that us ships be used to provide an offshore 
radar net to help colombia interdict drug traffickers a top 
aide said today 
national security adviser brent scowcroft said the proposal has 
been on the shelf since colombian officials balked at news 
reports that the united states was considering a naval blockade 
of their ports 
us officials have denied they ever planned a blockade calling 
use of the term unfortunate 
bush meanwhile signed a new united nations compact to help 
curb international drug traffic and urged other nations to do the 
same to join us in working together to rid the world of this 
menace the menace of drugs 
the un convention against illegal traffic in narcotic drugs 
adopted in vienna in december 1988 calls upon all nations to make 
illegal the production cultivation and transportation of narcotic 
and other danger drugs 
it also calls for tighter controls of chemicals used in drug 
production and sets up guidelines for extraditing drug offenders 
seizing drugtainted assets and curbing moneylaundering 
bush at a signing ceremony said that on the eve of our 
andean drug summit and the united nations general assembly special 
session on drugs we call upon all nations to join us in ratifying 
this convention 
the senate ratified the agreement last november the united 
states is the fifth of 76 signatories to the convention to ratify 
it 
meantime scowcroft told a white house briefing on thursdays 
fournation drug summit in cartagena colombia that the united 
states never planned a naval blockade but wanted to provide a 
radar net and give the colombians a better indication of air 
traffic that might be involved in drug trading 
we would be interested in improved cooperation in that kind of 
interdiction scowcroft said 
its an idea we think has merit i expect it might be 
discussed at the cartagena meeting among bush and the presidents 
of colombia peru and bolivia 
were not trying to push the use of us military forces where 
theyre not needed or wanted scowcroft said 
he said the radar screen would be confined to equipment on us 
naval ships cruising off the coasts of colombia and would not 
entail any landbased usmanned radar installations 
however scowcroft said the united states has provided colombia 
and other andean nations with radar equipment 
scowcroft said the communique that will be signed by the four 
presidents on thursday will address the broad issues of us 
economic assistance to the andean nations and will also cover 
military interdiction assistance 
it will call for reducing the demand for drugs in the united 
states curbing us export of chemicals such as ether used to 
manufacture cocaine from coa leaves and will deal with the export 
of us weapons to the region and with money laundering he said 
in additon the united states will promise to broaden our 
reach into international financial institutions to gain 
additional economic aid for the latin nations scowcroft said 
us allies have an enormous interest in the success of this 
operation scowcroft said noting that the drug problem is an 
international one 
commenting on a dispute with colombia over coffee and cutflower 
trade scowcroft offered little hope that progress would be made on 
resolving the disagreements at the drug summit 
colombian president virgilio barco has complained to bush that 
the us commerce department is engaged in a trade procedure 
against colombian flower growers that could result in big tariffs 
on colombiangrown cut flowers 
scowcroft said there is nothing the administration can do about 
the matter that the commerce department action was initiated after 
us flower growers protested that colombia was dumping flowers 
in this country at belowfairmarket prices 
even though the united states would like to encourage colombian 
farmers to grow crops other than coca leaves we dont know 
exactly how this will work out scowcroft said 
colombia is also unhappy that us withdrawal from an 
international coffeepricing agreement last year sent colombian 
coffee prices tumbling the pricing agreement collapsed putting 
it back together again is not easy scowcroft said 
he expressed some skepticism over plans to try to encourage crop 
substitutions for cocaine production saying each of the andean 
nations would have to work out such specific plans itself

use of illegal drugs by high school seniors 
college students and other young adults declined further in 1989 as 
antidrug attitudes increasingly took hold an annual survey found 
today 
frequent drug use has been sliding even faster and today the 
likelihood that a high school senior or college student will use 
drugs routinely is about half what it was a decade ago according 
to the study 
this reduced demand is attributable largely to the important 
changes occurring in the attitudes beliefs and social norms among 
our young people said lloyd johnston a university of michigan 
social scientist who helped conduct the survey 
johnston said the decline has come about because antidrug 
education has made illegal drug use unfashionable and he noted the 
dropoff has been occurring despite students belief that marijuana 
and cocaine are easy to get 
drug use among high school seniors peaked in 1981 when 656 
percent of those surveyed said they had used marijuana cocaine or 
some other illicit drug at least once during their lives that 
figure dropped during the decade to 509 percent last year 
the 1989 survey of college students found that 367 percent used 
an illicit drug at least once during the previous year compared 
with 562 percent in 1980 when this survey began 
among young adults aged 1928 use of an illegal drug within the 
previous year dropped to 328 percent in 1988 from 419 percent in 
1986 
in 1979 nearly 39 percent of high school seniors said they had 
used an illegal drug during the previous 30 days and by 1989 that 
figure had dropped by nearly half to 197 percent according to the 
survey college students saw a similar decline from 384 percent 
in 1979 to 182 percent last year 
johnston said that although the survey missed high school 
dropouts the data suggest the decline in drug use may also extend 
to this group as well the survey found the dropoff in use was at 
least as great among high school seniors who were frequently truant 
and had poor grades as among those who were seldom truant and had 
good grades he said 
use of crack a highly addictive and smokable form of cocaine 
also appears to be dropping johnston said although not as much as 
use of powdered cocaine 
the survey of high school seniors which began in 1975 polled 
about 17000 students in 135 public and private high schools 
nationwide the other survey is a followup study of previously 
participating graduating classes in this survey about 1200 
college students and about 6600 high school graduates who are one 
to 10 years past high school were questioned by mail

a bipartisan group announced today it will 
seek passage by state legislatures of resolutions calling for 
12year limits on service in each chamber of congress 
we propose to move towards a reinvigoration of our congress 
by restoring the citizen legislature envisioned by our founders 
said former oneterm republican rep james k coyne of 
pennsylvania cochairman of americans to limit congressional terms 
members of the house serve twoyear terms and senators serve 
sixyear terms under provisions of the constitution in effect 
since it was adopted 200 years ago they may serve any number of 
terms 
the groups proposal would limit a person to serving 12 years in 
the house and 12 years in the senate in his or her lifetime that 
would mean a limit of 24 years overall in congress 
the group is acting under a provision of the constitution 
allowing the legislatures of twothirds of the states to propose a 
constitutional amendment congress on receiving such a proposal 
would call a constitutional convention alternatively congress 
itself could propose an amendment in either event it must be 
ratified by threefourths of the states 
coyne said south dakota already has passed such a resolution and 
action is pending in alaska arizona colorado connecticut idaho 
kansas missouri new hampshire utah vermont wyoming florida 
louisiana and hawaii 
we have a very very real chance of doing it quickly coyne 
said 
he said his organization is bipartisan and has 118 state 
legislators 34 former members of congress and two current members 
of congress on its national advisory board he said he did not know 
the party breakdown 
cleta mitchell a former democratic state legislator from 
oklahoma joined coyne in announcing the effort

150 black students marched outside the high school and chanted 
shut em down no school 
hundreds of other black students filed inside selma high school 
although they waited about 10 minutes after the bell rang white 
students walked inside well before the bell with security provided 
by state troopers national guardsmen and military police as well 
as selma police 
school officials reported that 1368 students or 23 percent of 
the school systems 5971 students were absent this morning 
compared with normal absenteeism of about 5 percent enrollment 
dropped from 6049 last week 
selma high closed feb 6 and all 11 public schools in the city 
have been closed since wednesday as tensions rose in a racial 
protest over the white school board members vote to dismiss 
norward roussell the first black school superintendent in this 
landmark city of the civil rights era 
student protesters voiced support of roussell and of his efforts 
to limit a program known as leveling or tracking which blacks say 
unfairly puts black students in slowerlearning groups while whites 
mostly are in fasterpaced classes 
down with tracking equal education the protesting students 
shouted today as they marched around the high schools flagpole 
the protesters earlier marched to the school while law officers 
stood guard and at one point the marchers had a brief 
confrontation with state troopers 
when several troopers told the marchers they needed to stay away 
from the school the marchers stopped to pray and the troopers 
took off their hats during the prayer the students then moved 
through the troopers who did not try to physically restrain them 
as they went to the flagpole 
there is no reason for all this security because they didnt 
come here to be violent said dallas county commissioner perry 
varner a black protest leader who was arrested in a melee in the 
mayors office last week 
this is the first time troops have been used to ensure that 
whites could go to school said jamie wallace executive vice 
president of the local chamber of commerce 
more than 100 black students who staged a sitin at the citys 
only public high school voted monday night to continue their 
protest at the school today 
the battle is on with the school until we get what we 
deserve said state sen hank sanders whose daughter malika an 
11thgrader is one of the protest leaders 
roussell whose dismissal at the end of the school year sparked 
the protests said his wife a teacher and daughter a 
fifthgrader would be back in school today despite anonymous 
threats he had received 
i have some concerns about personal safety and their safety 
this is an emotional issue tied to political and racial 
attitudes he said 
at the meeting monday at first baptist church where black 
students voted to continue the protests roussell praised the 
students for their conduct during the sitin but told them and 
about 300 adults that he did not come here to be superintendent 
over empty classrooms and closed schools 
roussell took over the 80000ayear job 2 years ago after 
serving as an associate superintendent in new orleans the racial 
turmoil began feb 2 when six white members of the city school 
board voted to dismiss russell 
protests closed two schools feb 6 and all 11 of selmas public 
schools wednesday roussell was reinstated but the board declined 
to extend his contract beyond its june expiration 
roussell and his supporters say the board opposes him because of 
his race not his alleged lack of managerial skills cited in an 
evaluation 
he said his white support started eroding when he proposed 
changing the systems tracking program to enable more blacks to get 
into predominantly white higherlevel classes the enrollment is 
about 70 percent black 
on monday about 150 black students sitting in at selma high met 
with roussell then rolled up their sleeping bags and marched a 
mile to city hall where a sitin of about 25 students and adults 
has continued nonstop since thursday 
hes our leader he felt it was in our best interest to leave 
plus the school board would fire him if we didnt leave student 
protester latima salaam said 
after the protesters left the school some white parents stopped 
by to pick up their childrens belongings so they could transfer to 
other schools sandra knapp sewell said she and her daughter 
melissa were moving 35 miles east to prattville 
those transfers estimated by selmas two allwhite private 
schools to be as many as 35 in one day included the sixthgrade 
son of white school board member edie jones who enrolled monday at 
allwhite morgan academy in selma 
im leaving a place ive lived in 45 years to make sure she 
has a safe place to go to school mrs sewell said 
also monday us district judge charles butler of mobile 
refused to a request by the city to grant a temporary restraining 
order against the sitins after getting assurances from the 
protesters attorneys that they would not disrupt classes and would 
soon leave city hall 
city attorney henry pitts urged the judge to prohibit the 
protesters from totally paralyzing city government he said the 
dispute now does not involve the human rights that were at stake in 
1965 when the selmatomontgomery voting rights march helped blacks 
gain access to ballot boxes across the south

british foreign secretary douglas hurd 
announced today that the western allies and the soviet union are 
quite close on a procedure for the unification of west and east 
germany 
this strikes me as an admirable and commonsense procedure 
hurd said we are waiting for final approval from moscow 
the announcement referred to a us plan to have east and west 
germany work out legal political and economic procedures for a 
merger immediately after east germany holds national elections in 
midmarch 
the big four allies of world war ii the united states 
britain france and the soviet union then will discuss security 
questions including whether a reunified germany would be a member 
of the north atlantic treaty organization 
the plan known as 2plus4 as the subject of a feverish an 
offthefloor discussion today while nato and warsaw pact foreign 
ministers held a closed session on a us proposal for unarmed 
aerial surveillance to ally suspicions of surprise attacks 
secretary of state james a baker iii met with soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze shevardnadze then met with west 
german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
hurd said meanwhile he had been holding continuous discussion 
with baker genscher and french foreign minister roland dumas 
we are quite close to an agreement on a proposal for a meeting 
for the four powers hurd said 
by the time the plan surfaced here monday state department 
officials were privately describing moscow as quite interested 
in the scheme 
baker held an unannounced meeting with shevardnadze on monday 
their second of the day and the two spoke for about 10 minutes 
today baker was returning to washington later from a nineday trip 
that also took him to the soviet union czechoslovakia bulgaria 
and romania 
three forces are at work in the nolongersecret operation 
a conviction moscow is beginning to share with washington that 
unification is inevitable 
a western desire to keep germany in nato 
anxiety within the countries among people who suffered at 
germanys hands in world war ii 
bush administration policymakers are operating on an assumption 
those concerns can be allayed and any aggressive german 
tendencies diverted by keeping germany within the 16member nato 
the plan is called 2plus4 because east germany and west 
germany joined by the big four allied powers would work out the 
formula for the new and stronger state 
as state department officials outlined the strategy to reporters 
here east germany would become a sovereign power after national 
elections are held in midmarch 
almost immediately the warsaw pact ally of the soviet union 
would begin working with west germany to plan the legal economic 
and political foundation of a merged country 
among the decisions that would be theirs to make would be the 
size of the germany army 
in a second stage the big four would delve into security issues 
the most important among them a german role in nato 
but the state department officials speaking on condition their 
names not be used stressed that no outside power would have the 
right to interfere in the germans sovereign decisions 
preparations for the evolving german reunification scenario have 
been under way quietly for several weeks even though the subject 
was not the stated reason for a number of meetings baker has had 
with world leaders in and out of washington 
baker talked about the matter separately with hurd and genscher 
separately in washington with dumas during a refueling stop en 
route to czechoslovakia and finally with soviet leaders when he 
reached moscow 
genscher outlined his vision for a new germany in a speech to 
the open skies conference here today there was no reference to 
nato or germanys association with the alliance in the future 
we tell all our neighbors what we want to unite the federal 
republic of germany west germany the german democratic republic 
east germany and the whole of berlin no less and no more we 
do not have territorial claims against any of our neighbors 
genscher said 
he said the germans seek unification out of responsibility for 
european peace and we seek it as a contribution to stability in 
europe 
referring obliquely to world war ii the foreign minister said 
we germans now follow the path of unity for which we waited for 
decades we are aware of the historical dimension of this process 
west german chancellor helmut kohl and genscher flew to moscow 
last saturday to lobby for unification with east germany 
the soviets are quite interested in this said a us 
official who is a principal architect of the closely guarded us 
policy they have not adopted a dogmatic position 
and yet the official acknowledged the soviets also have not 
approved any mechanism for unification including the us 
formula 
britain and france have signed on however and the campaign is 
picking up steam 
gorbachev was quoted monday by adn the east german news agency 
as having told kohl that it was unacceptable for germany to stay in 
nato 
but brent scowcroft the national security assistant to 
president bush said monday in washington that the soviets had told 
baker it was not really as positive as that 
and shevardnadze told a group of british reporters here that 
while neutrality is the best way for a reunited germany i am 
not saying neutrality is the only way

nelson mandela returned on 
tuesday to the fourroom brick house he remembered as home for 27 
years but it has become a monument surrounded day and night by 
people hoping for a glimpse of him 
his wife winnie built him a mansion on a hill three years ago 
but suffered severe criticism for it 
mandela spent his first two nights of freedom in large homes in 
neighborhoods designated for whites on sunday night the mandelas 
their youngest daughter and grandchildren stayed with archbishop 
desmond tutu at the bishopscourt mansion owned by the anglican 
church near cape town 
tutu the nations first black archbishop has ignored apartheid 
laws that ban blacks from living in the area 
on monday evening mandela flew to johannesburg and slept in a 
house owned by a white businessman set in about four acres of 
garden and parkland 
the press and some members of the public criticized winnie 
mandela when she had the 15room 200000 home built on a hillside 
in 1987 
she said mandela deserved to live in such a house when he was 
freed but he sent word from prison he did not want to enjoy such 
luxury amid the poverty of 25 million people in soweto the huge 
black township outside johannesburg 
vandals did extensive damage to the empty mansion known in 
soweto as winnies palace it has been refurbished recently 
but no one has said why 
close associates said tuesday the black leader had wanted to go 
straight from prison sunday to the small house on a corner built 
when the orlando section of soweto was being established in the 
early 1940s mandela worked for the municipal government then 
he and his first wife evelyn moved into the house when it was 
new and their four children spent their childhoods in it 
they were divorced in 1957 and mandela later brought his new 
wife winnie to the house an outbuilding in the yard contains 
several bedrooms where winnie mandelas notorious bodyguard stayed 
until it was disbanded last year 
the house was nearly gutted in july 1988 when boys from a nearby 
high school set it afire during a battle with members of the 
bodyguard the damage has been repaired and mandela sent orders 
from prison that no one was to be charged or prosecuted for the 
arson 
antiapartheid groups denounced mrs mandela last year for 
allowing what they called a reign of terror by her bodyguards 
nine members of the group known as the mandela united soccer 
club are charged in the death of a young activist who allegedly 
was one of four youths kidnapped and beaten at the mandela home in 
december 1988 
by the time of the fire mrs mandela already had bought a 
larger ranchstyle house in diepkloof another part of the 
township where she spent at least half her time she did not 
return to the orlando house after it was burned 
when one of mandelas african national congress colleagues 
wilton mkwayi was freed from life prison in october he occupied 
the old house temporarily on tuesday mkwayi asked the people 
outside to disperse after mandela arrived for a rest but they 
simply stood silently watching

while blacks celebrated nelson 
mandelas release from prison rightwing whites berated the 
government tuesday and some predicted violence 
the conservative party which won 31 percent of the white vote 
in elections last year and supports the apartheid policy of race 
discrimination expects thousands of supporters at a rally thursday 
in pretoria 
we will give president fw de klerk a friendly but firm 
message your days are numbered party leader andries treurnicht 
said at a rally of about 3000 supporters monday night near cape 
town 
the conservatives filed treason charges monday against mandela 
and his african national congress colleague walter sisulu based on 
support for an armed struggle against apartheid 
citizens can file private charges for police to investigate but 
the governing national party is unlikely to allow any official 
action 
mandela the countrys bestknown black leader was freed sunday 
after more than 27 years in prison tens of thousands of blacks 
greeted him in cape town on sunday and more than 100000 welcomed 
him tuesday in soweto his hometown outside johannesburg 
we are a simple people but will not be oppressed and we 
refuse to accept mandela treurnicht said who would think we 
live in a christian country when fw de klerk chose a sunday to 
free mandela 
conservatives say that under a black government the countrys 
28 million blacks will dominate the 5 million whites they say the 
solution is to partition south africa into several racially based 
states 
eugene terreblanche leader of the neonazi afrikaner resistance 
movement said mandelas support for the armed struggle means 
conflict is unavoidable 
terreblanche said his organization realizes the powerlessness 
of the government and is preparing itself to meet the anc 
revolution 
he said mandela is now more free than mr de klerk and if 
the anc ever get to the negotiation table they would again 
threaten murder and death if they did not get their way 
about 2000 members and supporters of the afrikaner resistance 
movement marched through pretoria on saturday carrying swastika 
flags and alternately shouting hang mandela and hang de 
klerk 
most rightwing whites are afrikaners descended from dutch 
settlers of south africa afrikaners account for about 3 million of 
the 5 million whites and are traditionally more conservative than 
the whites of british descent

despite the expenditure of tens of billions of 
dollars to clean it the environment is about as polluted as it was 
20 years ago says pioneering environmentalist barry commoner 
there is inescapable evidence that the massive national effort 
to restore the quality of the environment has failed commoner 
writes in his making peace with the planet to be published in 
april 
the congress has mandated massive environmental improvement 
the epa has devised elaborate detailed means of achieving this 
goal most of the prescribed measures have been carried out at 
least in part and in nearly every case the effort has failed to 
even approximate the goals 
commoner 72 a biologist and an organizer of the first earth 
day in 1970 directs the center for the biology of natural systems 
at queens college in new york he earlier wrote the closing 
circle an influential book on the environment 
ruth caplan executive director of environmental action agreed 
in part with commoners assessment but says the environment would 
be much worse today if it werent for the passage and 
implementation of the major environmental laws of the 1970s 
she said in a telephone interview that the environment remains 
fouled because of a vast increase in polluting sources in both 
cars and miles driven for example and because new problems such 
as global warming have arisen they have been caused in part by 
sources such as carbon dioxide that in the 1970s werent viewed 
as troublesome 
many of the pollutants that the earlier congressional actions 
were designed to control have been controlled said brooks 
yeager vice president of the national audubon society 
but weve learned how to make thousands of new ones it 
is not that the solutions to the old problems havent worked its 
that the solutions to the new problems havent been brought on fast 
enough 
commoner in his new book espouses a view that is becoming 
widespread in the environmental movement further progress will 
result only when pollutants are not allowed to be produced 
while most environmental laws seek to control released 
pollutants largely through devices ranging from automobile 
catalytic converters to smokestack scrubbers commoner argues that 
the destruction of our environment begins in our farms and 
factories and thats where we have to go to save it 
commoner cited a 92 percent decline between 1975 and 1987 in 
airborne concentrations of lead which caused brain damage in 
children and a 37 percent decrease in the lead levels in 
childrens blood between 1976 and 1982 
those improvements he says came after leaded gasoline was 
banned 
the incidence of ddt in humans body fat fell by 79 percent 
between 1970 and 1983 commoner says the insecticide was banned in 
1972 
environmental victories also have been won by banning 
cancercausing pcbs barring atmospheric nuclear tests and removing 
mercury from the chlorinemaking process he says 
on the other hand commoner says most pollutants that were to 
have been controlled by devices havent been curbed much 
a control device always allows some pollution to enter the 
environment so that increased productive activity negates the 
devices intended effect he says in contrast when a 
pollutant is simply eliminated or banned its rate of entry into 
the environment falls permanently to zero 
on the average the emission of particulates sulfur dioxide 
carbon monoxide nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds 
decreased by only 18 percent between 1975 and 1987 thus since 
1975 the overall improvement of most air pollutant emissions has 
been at best modest the only exception is lead 
the same pattern emerges with water pollution he says while 
some rivers and lakes have been cleaned there has been scant 
overall improvement 
the incidence of toxic synthetic chemicals in water air and 
food appears to be increasing commoner says adding that the 
depletion of ozone which results in global warming has also 
continued to worsen 
commoner argues that society must shift to products that dont 
pollute or pollute less such as lighter cars powered by low 
compression engines that dont throw off nitrogen oxides an 
ingredient in acid rain organic farming emphasis on railroads and 
mass tansit solar power and cogeneration weatherizing homes 
recycling and the use of plastics only when they are really 
needed such as for artificial hearts and videotape 
were not talking about putting people out of work commoner 
says were talking about corporations shifting their investments 
to technologies that are clean

astronomy will experience a true golden 
age of largetelescope construction in this decade astronomers 
and astronomical engineers say 
speakers at the society of photooptical instrumentation 
engineers international symposium heard monday about nine major 
projects in various stages of construction or planning 
the projects all intended to be operating before the end of the 
century range from a 35meter or 138inch telescope on kitt 
peak southwest of tucson to the european southern observatorys 
array of four 8meter or 316inch instruments called the very 
large telescope with the four telescopes working together the vlt 
could be the equivalent of a single 16meter or 633inch scope 
telescope designs and materials are evolving so quickly that one 
of the projects is the rebuilding of the multiple mirror telescope 
on mount hopkins south of tucson its only been operating about 10 
years and is presently the third largest in the world but the new 
telescopes will outshine it if it isnt given a bigger mirror 
the 90s will be the decade of a true golden age of 
construction of large telescopes said patrick osmer project 
scientist for the national optical astronomy observatories twin 
8meter telescopes project to be built in hawaii and chile 
basically the need for big telescopes is to get more light 
said retired noao official larry d barr detectors are 
approaching almost theoretically perfect efficiency so how do you 
detect more faint objects the answer is you build bigger 
telescopes 
also in the works are 
the university of californias keck observatory whose mirrow 
will be made up of 36 computercontrolled segments and will be 
equivalent to a 10meter or 396inch mirror nearing completion on 
hawaiis mauna kea 
the united kingdoms large telescope project also an 8meter 
telescope to be built in partnership with spain and germany in the 
canary islands or with the united states and canada on mauna kea 
the 43 million magellan 8meter telescope project involving 
the carnegie institute johns hopkins university and the university 
of arizona at las campanas chile 
the japanese national large telescope a 75meter instrument 
to stand next to the keck 
the 60 million columbus telescope project two sidebyside 
8meter telescopes resembling binoculars to be built on mount 
graham in southeastern arizona by italys arcetri observatory the 
university of arizona and ohio state university 
peter strittmatter director of the university of arizonas 
steward observatory said the latter project informally called the 
twin shooter will have the equivalent viewing power of a 
telescope 113 meters or 447 inches in diameter and twice its 
image sharpness 
the multiple mirror telescope whose six mirrors produce one 
image equivalent to that of a telescope 45 meters or 178 inches in 
diameter will be converted to a single 65meter or 257inch 
mirror to keep it competitive with the big new telescopes at a 
cost of about 155 million said director fred chaffee 
the price is very low compared to the 45 million to 50 
million for building an equivalent telescope from scratch he told 
more than 200 astronomers the mmt cost 12 million when it was 
dedicated in may 1979 
while that observatory is giving up its multiple mirrors the 
keck whose cost has been estimated at at least 90 million is 
scheduled to have nine of its 36 hexagonal segments installed 
computercontrolled and ready for first light or initial 
observation by august said jerry nelson of the university of 
californiaberkeley additional segments will be added as their 
polishing is completed at the rate of two per month he said 
in the meantime the edwin p hubble space telescope is 
scheduled for placement in orbit by a space shuttle crew in april 
from above the atmosphere it is expected to allow astronomers to 
see seven times as far as the most powerful earthbound telescope

soweto south africa ap here are excerpts from nelson 
mandelas speech tuesday in his hometown 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
today my return to soweto fills my heart with joy at the same 
time i also return with a deep sadness with a deep sense of 
sadness sadness to learn that you are still suffering under an 
inhuman system 
the housing shortage the schools crisis unemployment and the 
crime rate still remain 
i am even more proud to be a member of this community because of 
the pioneering role it has played in the struggle for the 
democratization of local government 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
as proud as i am to be part of the soweto community i have been 
greatly disturbed by the statistics of crime what i have read in 
the newspapers although i understand the deprivations our people 
suffer i must make it clear that the level of crime in our 
township is unhealthy and must be eliminated as a matter of 
urgency it is through the creation of democratic and accountable 
structures that we can achieve this i salute the anticrime 
campaigns conducted by our organizations 
the crisis in education that exists in south africa demands 
special attention the education crisis in black schools is a 
political crisis it arises out of the fact that our people have no 
vote and therefore cannot make the government of the day responsive 
to their needs 
apartheid education is inferior and a crime against humanity 
education is an area that needs attention that needs the attention 
of all our people students parents teachers workers and all of 
the organized sectors of our community 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it has been the policy of the anc that all the schools and the 
entire education system is a site of struggle the outside process 
of learning must take place in the schools i want to add my voice 
therefore to the call made at the beginning of the year that all 
students must return to school and learn 
we must continue our struggle for peoples education within the 
school system and utilize its resources to achieve our goals i 
call on the government to build more schools to train and employ 
more teachers and to abandon its policies of forcing our children 
out of the school system by use of various measures 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
as i said when i stood on the dock at the rivonia trial 27 years 
ago and as i said on the day of my release in cape town the anc 
will pursue the armed struggle against the government as long as 
the violence of apartheid continues 
our armed combatants act under the political leadership of the 
anc cadres of our peoples army are engaged not only in military 
affairs but as the political commissars of our movement we are 
therefore disturbed that there are certain elements amongst those 
who claim to support the liberation struggle who use violence 
against our people the hijacking and setting alight of vehicles 
and the harassment of innocent people are criminal acts that have 
no place in our struggle we condemn that

you also have a place we note with appreciation that there are 
certain areas where policemen are acting with restraint and

of their race 
much debate has been spoken of the anc policies on the economy 
relating to nationalization and the redistribution of wealth we 
believe that apartheid has created a heinous system of exploitation 
in which a racist minority monopolizes economic wealth while the 
vast majority of the oppressed and black people are condemned to 
poverty 
south africa is a wealthy country it is the labor of black 
workers that has built the cities roads and factories we see they 
cannot be excluded from sharing this wealth the anc is just as 
committed to economic growth and productivity as the present 
employer came to be yet we are also committed to ensure that a 
democratic government has the resources to address the inequalities 
caused by apartheid our people need proper houses not ghettos 
like soweto 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
workers need a living wage and the right to join unions of their 
own choice and to participate in determining policies that affect 
their lives our history has shown that apartheid has stifled 
growth created mass unemployment and led to spiraling inflation 
that has undermined the standard of living of the majority of our 
people both black and white only a participatory democracy 
involving our people in the structures of decisionmaking at all 
levels of society can ensure that this is corrected we will 
certainly introduce policies that address the economic problems 
that we face 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
we call on employers to recognize the fundamental rights of 
workers in our country we are marching to a new future based on 
strong foundations of respect for each other achieved through 
bonafide negotiations in particular we call for genuine 
negotiations to achieve a fair labor relations act and mechanisms 
to resolve conflict employers can play their role in shaping the 
new south africa by acknowledging these rights we call on workers 
black and white to join industrial trade unions 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
we shall play an indispensable role in our struggle against 
apartheid a number of obstacles to the creation of a nonracial 
democratic south africa remain and need to be tackled the fears of 
whites about their rights and place in a south africa they do not 
control exclusively are an obstacle we must understand and address 
i stated in 1964 that i and the anc are as opposed to black 
domination as we are to white domination we must accept that our 
statements and declarations alone will not be sufficient to allay 
the fears of white south africans we must clearly demonstrate our 
good will to our white compatriots and convince them by our conduct 
that a south africa without apartheid will be a better home for 
all 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
we call on those who out of ignorance have collaborated with 
apartheid in the past to join our liberation struggle no men or 
women who have abandoned apartheid will be excluded from our 
movement towards a nonracial united and democratic south africa 
based on oneperson onevote on a common voters roll

our primary task remains to unite our people across the length

consolidated in all our sectors democratic political practice and 
accountable leadership must be strengthed on all fronts our

intensified on all fronts let each one of you and all of our

generals that make history but the masses of the people i have 
always believed in this but much to the extent to which i now 
believe that basic principle because i have seen with my own eyes 
the masses of our people the workers the peasants the doctors 
the lawyers the clergy all our people i have seen them making 
history and that is why all of us are here today 
in conclusion i must repeat what comrade sisulu has said it is 
proper that we should behave in a way worthy of disciplined freedom 
fighters let not a single hair not a window be broken when you 
leave this place and remember that we have friends on death row 
and it is your struggle that has made the government grant us some 
sort of relief in this regard and we sincerely hope that there are 
men amongst the government who will respond constructively to the 
demand that those men should be set free

retail sales rose a strong 16 percent in 
january their sharpest gain in more than a year the government 
reported tuesday analysts said the broad advance demonstrated 
enough consumer confidence to hold off any recession 
consumer spending is still alive said john silvia an 
economist with kemper financial services in chicago most 
categories showed advances that suggest to me that the consumer 
is coming back in the first quarter taking up his normal pace of 
spending 
the commerce department said sales totaled a seasonally adjusted 
1464 billion and posted their steepest increase since a 21 
percent gain in october 1988 
this positive report confirms our forecast that consumer 
spending will increase this year reversing the decline of late 
1989 commented william k macreynolds forecasting director of 
the us chamber of commerce 
december sales which originally were said to be up 02 percent 
actually fell 02 percent dragged down by a 26 percent decline in 
automobile sales tuesdays report said auto sales represent about 
20 percent of retail sales 
but car sales prompted by a renewed round of incentives that 
continued into february were up 54 percent in january the gain 
in car sales was the largest since a 66 percent advance in october 
1988 
excluding the oftenvolatile auto category retail sales still 
rose 06 percent last month 
the underlying strength is really quite remarkable said 
david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co a new york 
government securities dealer you really had strength across the 
board 
it hints that consumer confidence is not fading jones 
continued as long as consumers stay positive since they count 
for twothirds of gnp the economy is likely to stay out of a 
recession 
retail sales account for about onethird of consumer spending 
which itself represents about twothirds of the gnp the nations 
output of goods and services 
the economy particularly the manufacturing and construction 
sectors slowed in the fourth quarter of 1989 squeezed by high 
interest rates as the federal reserve board kept a tight rein on 
credit to cap inflation 
durable goods bigticket items like cars expected to last more 
than three years felt the brunt of the sluggishness since many of 
these products are financed through loans 
but durable goods sales rose 39 percent in january after 
falling 21 percent in december sales of building materials were 
up 23 percent and purchases of furniture and other home 
furnishings rose 2 percent 
purchases of nondurable goods such as food and clothing 
advanced 03 percent on top of a 09 percent gain in december 
gasoline stations led the advance with a 25 percent increase but 
jones said the gain probably reflected hikes in prices not unit 
sales 
also posting gains were drug stores up 23 percent department 
stores up 22 percent and restaurants and bars up 15 percent 
grocery store sales declined 04 percent while apparel purchases 
were off 07 percent 
for the three months from november through january overall 
retail sales were up 38 percent

heavy voter turnout caused 20minute waits 
at polling places this morning in an election that could make this 
rocky mountain ski resort the first city in the nation to ban the 
sale of fur 
everyone is coming out its going slow said deputy city 
clerk kathy strickland we had three booths at the precincts last 
time and now we have four and they still are waiting in line 
so the turnout is going to be good 
the towns 3739 registered voters also will decide whether to 
stop construction of an 80 million luxury hotel approving in its 
place a smaller one favored by the city council 
celebrities including developer donald trump have jumped into 
the fray over the two issues 
aspen mayor bill stirling who proposed the ban on fur sales 
said he has received hundreds of letters from around the world 
supporting the proposed ban stirling faces a recall election in 
march prompted by citizens outraged over the fur issue 
after all noted the aspen times aspen is the capital of 
glitz where furs are as common in 1990 as pickup trucks with dogs 
were in 1970 
stirling counted amoung his supporters cartoonist berke breathed 
and actress kate jackson television stars rue mcclanahan and woody 
harrelson joined a rally for the ban sunday night 
arriving over the weekend to campaign for the fur sale ban was 
philosophy professor peter singer of australia considered the 
father of the international animal rights movement 
the real issue is whether it is all right to kill animals to 
make fur coats said the mayors wife katharine thalberg 
cofounder of the aspen society for animal rights 
the measures backers claim sales taxes on furs sold in aspen 
amount to profit from cruelty to animals opponents argue its a 
matter of personal freedom and warn that if fur sales are 
prohibited the wearing of furs and leather and even the sale of 
meat could be next 
aspen furrier mark kirkland leading the fight against the ban 
called it the biggest public relations disaster in aspens 
history aspen is losing tourist dollars left and right 
customers are calling and saying if im not welcome in aspen 
i wont come i can go anywhere in the world without getting 
into that hotbed of controversy kirkland said 
visitor numbers are down slightly this season said carol 
pasternak of the aspen chamber resort association she said 
publicity over the proposed fur ban may be having a negative 
effect but late and light snowfall this year also has taken its 
toll on tourism 
the hotel issue involves developer mohamed hadids plans for a 
292room ritzcarlton at the foot of aspen mountain hadid who has 
spent at least 13 million already is being sued by trump who had 
sought the same property for a smaller hotel he says he could have 
completed by now

the disorder that killed a 23yearold 
volleyball player when she received general anesthesia last month 
is apparently caused by a defective gene that normally helps 
muscles work a study says 
if that suspicion is confirmed further work might lead to a 
blood test to detect people at risk for the condition experts said 
the disorder is called malignant hyperthermia it causes 
sustained muscle contraction fever and muscle destruction in 
reaction to commonly used inhaled general anesthetics 
while there are no good statistics on how often it occurs 
estimates range from one in 10000 administrations of anesthetics 
to one in 50000 said henry rosenberg chairman of the 
professional advisory council of the malignant hyperthermia 
association of the united states 
pehaps one in 10 cases leads to death said rosenberg who added 
that his organization learns of about eight to 10 deaths a year in 
the united states 
malignant hyperthermia is blamed in last months death of judy 
bellomo a member of the us womens volleyball team she died 
during surgery for thyroid cancer 
rosenberg said such young people appear to be particularly 
susceptible to the condition 
if the new research leads to a reliable blood test to detect 
vulnerable people it would be an important advance he said 
monday the result would alert anesthesiologists not to use drugs 
that cause the reaction he said 
the current detection test is done for relatives of people with 
the condition it involves removing a piece of muscle about the 
length of a middle finger generally from the thigh said study 
coauthor david maclennan 
people are not very happy about having to do that he said 
the test done in the operating room is expensive and available 
only in certain medical centers rosenberg said 
in the new study scientists suggest that malignant hyperthermia 
comes from a defective version of a gene that normally tells muscle 
cells how to make a structure called the ryanodine receptor which 
plays a key role in muscle contraction 
scientists at the university of toronto and the childrens 
hospital of eastern ontario in ottawa studied a series of families 
in which susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia was inherited 
they found that the pattern in which the susceptibility ran in the 
families matched the inheritance pattern of the ryanodine receptor 
gene 
that suggests the gene is either responsible for malignant 
hyperthermia or that it lies very close to the reponsible gene on 
the threadlike structure called chromosome 19 maclennan of the 
university of toronto said in a telephone interview 
given the normal function of the gene it makes excellent 
sense that a defective form could trigger malignant hyperthermia 
he said 
researchers still must find the defect or defects within the 
gene that cause the disease he said then a blood test could 
detect those defects in people he said 
the new study appears in the current issue of the british 
journal nature

a poll says most americans would rather cut 
social security taxes than use surplus funds to reduce the federal 
deficit although a poll last month phrasing the issue 
differently found otherwise 
in an abc newswashington post poll released tuesday 60 percent 
of the 1008 adults surveyed opposed using surplus social security 
funds to cut the deficit and 63 percent supported lower social 
security taxes 
however in an nbc newswall street journal poll of registered 
voters in january 53 percent favored increasing social security 
taxes in order to reduce the deficit and to keep the social 
security fund sound 
the difference most likely was caused by the phrasing each poll 
used to frame its questions question wording can dramatically 
effect poll results especially on sensitive or complex issues 
one abcpost question noted that social security taxes have been 
rising and asked which do you generally prefer higher social 
security taxes and a bigger surplus or lower social security taxes 
with the taxpayers keeping some of the surplus most preferred to 
pocket the surplus 
the nbcjournal poll by contrast said some people favored 
canceling an increase in the social security tax because the 
surplus made it unnecessary while others favored the increase 
because the surplus is needed to hold down the deficit and to keep 
the social security fund sound for the future 
just over half given that phrasing favored the increase 
sen daniel p moynihan dny has proposed rolling back 
increases in the social security tax saying it was improper to use 
the funds surplus to reduce the federal budget deficit the bush 
administration opposes his plan 
the abcpost poll conducted by telephone among a random sample 
of adults feb 14 had a fourpoint margin of error the 
nbcjournal poll done by telephone jan 1316 among 1510 
registered voters had a threepoint error margin 
margin of error means in the abcpost poll that the results 
probably are within 4 percentage points of the results if all 
adults in the nation were asked precisely the same questions error 
margin does not take into account the possible effects of question 
wording

the third mate deputized by capt 
joseph hazelwood to command the exxon valdez on its disastrous 
voyage panicked and grabbed the wheel in a futile attempt to avert 
a jagged reef a seaman testified 
i started making the turn and he grabbed the wheel and helped 
make it robert kagan said of third mate gregory cousins i 
think he was kind of panicking then 
kagans appearance monday at hazelwoods trial set the stage for 
cousins to give his version of the disaster today 
cousins the third mate explained to jurors the chores he 
routinely carried out before sailing 
he depicted the day of the accident as routine in most ways he 
said that unlike other members of the crew he chose not to go into 
valdez on a shore excursion during the day instead cousins said 
he stayed aboard kept an eye on the loading of oil and helped top 
off the tanks 
the exxon valdez struck bligh reef on march 24 spilling more 
than 10 million gallons of oil and causing the nations worst oil 
spill the prosecution says hazelwood was drunk and negligent in 
turning over control of the ship to cousins who was not certified 
to navigate in treacherous prince william sound 
cousins of tampa fla took the stand briefly before court 
recessed monday saying he had crossed the sound between 26 and 30 
times and was on the bridge for half of those trips 
cousins who testified at hearings before the national 
transportation safety board last year has blamed the accident on a 
malfunction of the ship which he says did not respond to his 
rudder changes after he took it off automatic pilot 
kagan of harahan la testified after a coast guard monitor 
conceded he didnt even look for the exxon valdez on a radar 
monitor before the accident because he was told it had disappeared 
from radar 
i wasnt looking for him because he had been lost from 
radar said bruce blandford a civilian coast guard employee who 
indicated he was stunned when hazelwood called at about 1225 am 
to say the 987foot tanker was hard around and leaking oil 
i did a pretty hard swallow the adrenaline started 
pumping 
he said he called the commanding officer of the coast guard 
station and told him this was the big one the exxon valdez was 
on the rocks leaking oil 
hazelwoods defense has suggested that the monitor could have 
averted the grounding by watching the radar more closely and 
warning hazelwood he was off course but blandford said he had no 
authority to tell a captain to change course 
kagan told of making course changes repeatedly on orders from 
cousins in the final frantic moments before the crash first he 
said they grappled over the switch to remove the ship from 
automatic pilot and go back to manual steering 
we both reached for it at the same time he said 
then kagan said he heard three separate commands to go right 
left and then right again and saw cousins get on the phone 
presumably to hazelwood who was in his cabin 
in the seconds before grounding kagan said there was a command 
to turn hard left and cousins grabbed the wheel with him in a panic 
then he said he heard a little rattle bumping and the 
ship was aground he said he had no idea of the extent of damage 
until daybreak when he looked in the water and saw there was a 
lot of oil around the ship i was very surprised 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is charged with one felony 
count of seconddegree criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges of 
reckless endangerment negligent discharge of oil and operating a 
vessel while intoxicated the maximum penalty for conviction on all 
counts is 7 years in prison and 61000 in fines 
regarding hazelwoods orders after the grounding kagan said he 
cant be sure whether the captain was trying to move the ship off 
the rocks or just stabilize it 
i wasnt really sure what he was doing said kagan 
but in the aftermath he said hazelwood commended him he said 
i did a hell of a job

the united states has withdrawn all of its 
invasion troops from panama leaving an american force of 13504 in 
the country the white house said tuesday 
in the face of resentment from many latin nations which 
objected to the continued presence of the invasion troops panama 
president bush promised in his jan 31 state of the union address 
to bring the invasion troops home by the end of february 
the us troop strength in panama is now just under the 13597 
stationed there before the dec 20 invasion said presidential 
press secretary marlin fitzwater 
all the troops are gone that went in after dec 20 said 
fitzwater 
the troops stationed in panama are helping train a new police 
force officials said 
the invasion and toppling of gen manuel antonio noriega now 
facing a drugtrafficking trial in miami resulted in disbandment 
of his panamanian defense force 
us troop levels in panama have fluctuated by a few thousand in 
recent years depending on any exercises the military was 
conducting fitzwater said 13000 is an average 
still in panama are 2000 troops bush sent to panama in a 
showofforce to demonstrate his unhappiness over the may 7 
election which was invalidated by noriega 
the opposition candidate widely considered the winner of that 
election by independent observer groups guillermo endara was 
installed by the invasion troops as the countrys president 
latin countries roundly denounced the invasion which they 
considered an unwarranted display of us muscle the continued 
troop presence was seen as an additional affront 
that military presence prompted peruvian president alan garcia 
initially to back out of thursdays drug summit in colombia he 
said he would meet with bush as long as the invasion forces 
remained in panama 
with bushs jan 31 announcement and the administrations 
gradual troop withdrawal garcia last week announced he would 
attend the fournation summit after all

the soviet union remains a formidable military 
power in the pacific despite its proposed troop cutbacks in europe 
and the united states must keep up its guard defense secretary 
dick cheney said today 
cheney told the pacific and asian affairs council the soviets 
maintain more than a halfmillion ground troops in asia dozens of 
air divisions and one of its largest naval fleets numbering more 
than 260 surface ships and submarines 
despite publicity over a soviet drawdown in cam ranh bay in 
vietnam he said the soviet union continues to update and improve 
its navy in the region 
what it may be losing in numbers it is gaining back in terms 
of more modern capable ships and advanced weaponry cheney said 
referring to the soviet military as a formidable force in the 
region 
reminding his listeners in hawaii of the profound shock that 
overcame the united states with the japanese attack on pearl harbor 
in 1941 cheney argued that the united states must maintain its 
military strength in order to remain a global power and to protect 
its interests in the pacific 
he noted that americas commerce in east asia and the pacific 
amounts to 35 percent of its world trade 
cheney spoke before flying to seoul south korea for a twoweek 
pacific tour to study us troops commitments in light of 
congressional pressure for budget savings and increased support for 
us forces from asian nations hosting american troops 
some 120000 us troops are stationed in hawaii and in south 
korea the philippines and japan 
speaking with reporters monday cheney said he had no plans to 
dramatically alter our posture in the pacific 
but he added i dont rule out prospects for adjustments in 
our for deployments or in the overall size of our forces 
in recently announcing base closings and realignments cheney 
ordered that us military personnel be withdrawn from three 
airbases in south korea an act that concerned nations that have 
benefited by the us military presence 
cheney said he hopes to consult with the allied nations in the 
pacific and find ways for them to do more 
cheney was to be accompanied by a special state department 
ambassador for burdensharing the term for requesting more 
backup for the us military stationed in nations whose economies 
are doing well 
his trip has already sparked one controversy philippine 
president corazon aquino angry that the bush administration hasnt 
met payments on its bases in the philippines said she will not 
meet with cheney 
its too bad mrs aquino didnt want to host me thats her 
choice ive got plenty to do there to keep me busy cheney said 
talks on renewing the leases the huge us bases in the 
philippines are slated to begin next month we want to be a good 
friend and ally but we wont stay anywhere we arent wanted 
cheney said 
the defense secretary strongly disagreed with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachevs call to have us and soviet troops in 
europe at equal levels 
i dont believe theres any requirement on our part to go to 
the exact same level the soviets are at cheney said 
president bush has proposed that soviet troop levels in europe 
go down to 195000 in the central core of europe while us levels 
could be 225000 if forces in nations such as britain greece and 
turkey are included 
i think its a good position and i think we ought to stick to 
it cheney said 
we are there as allies they are there as occupational forces 
its important for us not to assume a moral equivalence between 
the soviet occupation of europe and our presence there as allies

whats left of the soviet communist party appears to be mainly 
vague concepts such as spirit and methodology 
the new party platform to be considered by the supreme soviet 
legislature on wednesday bears little resemblance in concept or 
phraseology to the ideas that have driven the soviet union for 72 
years 
pushed by mikhail s gorbachev through a meeting of the 
communist party central committee last week the platform calls for 
a strong europeanstyle presidency in a country where the communist 
party chief has been the most powerful person 
some other contradictions with the past 
in a system based on iron deductive logic claiming to predict 
the course of history the platform decries ideological blinkers 
dogmatism and intolerance towards different views and ideas 
from the marxist prohibition on private ownership of factories 
the party has come to the believe that the existence of 
individual property including ownership of the means of 
production does not contradict the modern stage in the countrys 
economic development 
the new soviet communist party now believes that instead of a 
dictatorship of the proletariat leading to communism there is no 
room for dictatorship by any class democratic centralism the 
theory that requires strict obedience to decisions made at the top 
is under review 
competition from other political parties is now all right the 
party recognizes that other countries using other systems have 
found a path to the general prosperity and social justice 
communists thought could only be reached through marxism 
the large majority of supreme soviet deputies who gather in the 
kremlin on wednesday will be asked to put those new ideas into 
action by calling an emergency session of the congress of peoples 
deputies to strengthen the presidency and passing laws on 
ownership of land property and taxation 
the new platform has phrases such as immunity of home and 
property the secrecy of correspondence and telephone 
conversations and freedom of speech the press meetings and 
demonstrations and the formation of public organizations 
it also talks about free selfdetermination in the spiritual 
sphere the freedom of conscience and religion 
the platform sketches a pluralistic system of political 
liberties and varied forms of ownership that make the future soviet 
union sound much like a western democracy with a mixed economy 
what is left of marxist theory and soviet communist practice 
the platform at the beginning of its first section affirms its 
faithfulness to the creative spirit of the materialist world 
outlook and the dialectic methodology of marx engels and lenin 
there is little to indicate how that will be implemented and if 
the communists keep power how it will distinguish the soviet union 
from other countries 
the platform proclaims with pride the soviet unions commitment 
to pensions free education and medical care and other social 
benefits pioneered by soviet socialism but they no longer can make 
the soviet union distinctive since the same benefits are offered 
elsewhere 
despite permitting private ownership of factories the new 
communist policy statement echoes classic marxism by taking a stand 
against the alienation of man from the product of his work and 
exploitation of one man by another 
both of those were thought to be the fruits of private 
ownership which the party now says is permissible 
one area where the partys intentions are not clear is on the 
question of private ownership of land 
it cost millions of lives but stalin took all the land for the 
state and organized peasant farmers into large collectives 
legislation that will be presented to the supreme soviet says 
land belongs to the people and may not be bought or sold holding 
true to marxist restrictions 
but one amendment calls for giving the soviet republics the 
right to make exceptions to that rule and the legislation also 
would permit farmers to pass the publicly owned land on to their 
children

leaders of a new organization called tuesday 
for state legislatures to back a constitutional amendment limiting 
the tenure of members of congress to 12 years in each house 
americas outrage with its congress has reached an alltime 
high and its no wonder said former rep james k coyne of 
pennsylvania cochairman of americans to limit congressional terms 
even as we struggle to free ourselves from budget deficits 
congress acts to give itself a 40 percent pay raise by 1991 
members of congress will pay themselves nearly 121000 a year 
placing them in the top 1 percent of american wage earners 
the organization wants twothirds of the state legislatures to 
pass resolutions calling upon congress to convene a constitutional 
convention to enact a constitutional amendment limiting a lawmaker 
to two sixyear terms in the senate and six twoyear terms in the 
house 
the proposed constitutional amendment would allow a person to 
serve maximum 12year terms in both houses for a total of 24 years 
in congress 
any constitutional amendment must be ratified by threefourths 
of the states 
however members of the group declined to suggest that sen 
strom thurmond rsc should step down thurmond at 87 the 
oldest member of congress said monday that he would seek his 
seventh term this year 
carter hardwick of charleston sc a member of the steering 
committee of americans to limit congressional terms said thurmond 
had told him he favored the idea of limitations 
i hope that nothing i say will be harmful to him hardwick 
said until the rules are changed for all the congressmen i 
would think we would be better served for him to continue to 
serve 
thurmond said in a statement tuesday that he did meet with 
hardwick and told him the idea should be given careful 
consideration and study and if the people deem it wise to amend 
the constitution to this effect they have the right to do so 
however unless this is done and everything being equal a 
members seniority greatly influences both his effectiveness and 
ability to meet the needs of the people of his state 
cleta mitchell a former democratic state legislator from 
oklahoma who joined coyne in the announcement conceded that you 
will find a lot of republicans perhaps more than democrats 
among the 188 state legislators the group says is backing its 
proposal 
democrats control both houses of congress 
coyne said south dakota has passed a resolution on the proposal 
and that action was pending in alaska arizona colorado 
connecticut idaho kansas missouri new hampshire utah vermont 
wyoming florida louisiana and hawaii

a state judge ruled today that virginia 
does not owe about 400 million in refunds to federal retirees who 
were taxed illegally until last year 
alexandria circuit judge donald h kents ruling makes virginia 
the first state to win a lawsuit stemming from the us supreme 
courts ruling last year that several states had taxed retirees 
improperly the attorney generals office said in a statement 
virginia revised its income tax laws in response to the ruling 
before the ruling the state had allowed state government retirees 
pensions to be taxfree but had taxed the pensions of federal 
government retirees 
the high court said all retirees must be taxed the same in a 
special session in april the legislature enacted a tax break for 
all pensioners a revision of that tax break that would make it 
less costly is pending in the legislature this year 
dennis harrington a spokesman for the national association of 
retired federal employees in washington said the organization was 
prepared to appeal kents ruling on behalf of the approximately 
200000 retired federal workers who live in virginia 
michael kator the lawyer who represented the retirees said he 
would ask the virginia supreme court to overturn kent kator also 
said the us supreme court has two pending cases from arkansas 
and florida that center on the question of unconstitutionally 
collected taxes 
meanwhile the virginia senate voted 318 today for a bill that 
would reduce the pension tax break enacted last year by 111 
million over the next two years 
legislators said the reform was needed because the bill passed 
last year was going to cost about 65 million more than they 
expected and the state is facing a decline in revenue growth

the fourmasted squarerigger moshulu the 
last winner of the great grain race around cape horn and a fixture 
on the waterfront for years is expected to be returned to sailing 
condition and leave the city 
one possible new berth for the 394foot barkentine the largest 
of its kind still afloat is san francisco its home port when it 
sailed under a us flag according to a spokesman for the owner 
the 86yearold tall ship has been a restaurant at penns 
landing since 1976 last july its plush interior was heavily 
damaged by a fire and the black ironhulled ship has been boarded 
up for months 
a spokesman for the owner specialty restaurants inc of 
anaheim calif said the plan is to refit the moshulu in another 
city possibly wilmington del as a working ship and sail it to a 
new home 
at one time it was thought shed never sail again but that 
hull built in 1904 is as sound as the day she was built said 
raymond e wallace a marine architect in san pedro calif who is 
working on the moshulu for the restaurant company 
specialty restaurants which owns 68 theme restaurants around 
the nation has started soliciting sponsors among corporations and 
foundations wallace said it would cost 4 million to 6 million 
to put it under sail again 
restaurant company president david tallichet is committed to the 
idea wallace said he wants something to happen here pretty 
soon he loves the ship and so do i wallace said 
the ship originally named the kurt was built along scotlands 
clyde river in 1904 for a german company and started out carrying 
copper and nitrate from mines in chile and mexico 
the united states seized the ship when it entered world war i 
it was renamed moshulu believed to be an indian word for 
fearless the us shipping board operated it until 1921 when 
the government sold it to a company that used it to haul lumber 
in 1935 it was sold to a finnish shipper and put into the grain 
trade from australia to europe giant sailing ships raced around 
cape horn in what came to be called the great grain races of the 
1920s and 30s 
the moshulu carrying 45000 square feet of canvas won the last 
race sailing from melbourne australia to cardiff wales in 91 
days in 1939 the record was 83 days set by the bark parma in 1933 
the moshulu lost its masts during world war ii and was used as a 
storage barge 
wallace and tallichet found the hulk in finland and brought it 
to the united states the present set of masts and yards were put 
on only for show and could not carry sails wallace said 
restaurant company executive jeff mills said the tall ship could 
end up in a number of seaports either as a restaurant or a museum 
but philadelphia is not one of them our lease is up he said 
possible new locations include jersey city nj wilmington 
san francisco and san diego he said 
the fire that damaged the moshulu started when a bare light bulb 
ignited paper products in a storage area city fire officials said 
it burned the ships hold and sent smoke throughout the upper 
decks six people were injured and 200 restaurant patrons had to 
flee

wind and the tide turned from 
allies to enemies today sending waves of gooey brown foam and 
sludge ashore and spurring calls for more workers to clean up an 
oil spill 
winds reversing toward shore combined with high tides to push 
new bands of thick crude oil onto state beaches producing the 
worst shoreline contamination yet from wednesdays tanker spill 
an earlier offshore wind pattern and calm seas that helped keep 
much of the 400000gallon oil slick from hitting the beach through 
the weekend gave way to onshore winds reaching speeds of 30 mph and 
6foot seas the national weather service said 
we have a very serious situation down here said mayor tom 
mays who called on gov george deukmejian to declare an emergency 
a spokesman said the governor would consider the move today 
two skimmers worked to keep a finger of the slick 200 yards from 
the newport beach shore about 300 people were dispatched for 
overnight cleanup and british petroleum said it would increase the 
number of workers throughout the day the coast guard said by 
wednesday police sgt andy gonis said 100 people would be 
dispatched to work a vacuum truck and absorbent booms 
were very concerned about the weather gonis said 
on monday waves of grimy crude oil spilled by the tanker 
american trader rolled into bolsa chica state beach leaving on the 
beach bands of oil with a consistency of tar that were 2 inches 
thick in some spots 
about 15 miles of beaches were ordered closed to the public and 
ship traffic was barred at newport harbor anaheim bay huntington 
harbour and the san gabriel river 
meanwhile the patchedup 811foot american trader moved from a 
long beach harbor anchorage and tied up at an arco dock this 
morning to unload its remaining cargo of crude oil and to begin 
repairs of hull punctures 
an estimated 400000 gallons of oil leaked from the vessel last 
wednesday afternoon after it apparently collided twice with its own 
anchor while mooring in shallow water at an offshore oil pipeline 
divers applied temporary patches to two holes in the punctured 
hull sunday and authorities said the vessel passed watertight 
integrity tests 
the oily onslaught spared the nearby inland bolsa chica 
wetlands an ecological reserve thats home for the endangered 
california brown pelican and a stop for thousands of migratory 
birds and marine life 
there is no oil in the estuary said patrick moore of the 
state department of fish and game but birds are leaving the 
wetlands and going to the ocean and bringing the oil back to the 
estuary 
in addition to the 30footwide slick on bolsa chica state 
beach the coast guard said smaller ribbons of oil 4feetwide were 
reported near the huntington beach pier 
seventyone dead birds grebes gulls loons and pelicans 
have been found in the area and more than 200 oilsoaked birds were 
rescued and taken to a treatment center moore said 
the beach pollution was so serious that british petroleum which 
chartered the american trader put out the call for more applicants 
to add to the current work force of about 400 cleanup employees 
we are looking for people who want to volunteer to be 
employed said bp spokesman fred garibaldi 
the coast guard said onethird of the alaskan crude still 
menaced the coast staining sand as far north as long beach 
skimmers picked up 23 percent of the spill and 43 percent 
evaporated or naturally dissipated 
on the beach meanwhile politicians environmentalists and 
celebrities gathered on the sand to demand legislation at the 
federal and state levels to prevent another spill 
sen alan cranston dcalif viewed the beaches from a 
helicopter then criticized president bush for telling reporters 
monday that the spill should not sound the death knell for offshore 
oil drilling 
the president should read the environmental impact statements 
by his own department of the interior which point out that the 
more drilling platforms that you have the more tankers you will 
need said cranston 
in searching for the accidents cause the coast guard said drug 
and alcohol tests on the ships officers including capt robert 
laware were negative

over the objections of government attorneys a 
federal judge on tuesday allowed lawyers for phoenix millionaire 
charles h keating jr to portray him as a victim of a vendetta by 
federal savings and loan regulators 
us district court judge stanley sporkin a former top 
regulator himself at the securities and exchange commission 
repeatedly overruled objections to testimony alleging leaks of 
confidential information from the federal home loan bank board 
about keatings lincoln and savings and loan association 
attorneys for the treasury departments office of thrift 
supervision which last year replaced the bank board as the thrift 
industrys chief regulator argued that the leaks were irrelevant 
to keatings suit challenging the federal takeover of the 55 
billion thrift last april 
sporkin however said he wanted to learn the broad backdrop 
to a case that because of keatings 13 million in political 
gifts to five us senators who interceded on lincolns behalf has 
become the focal point of a congressional ethics probe 
lincoln has the right to tell their side of the story and 
theyre telling it he said theyre saying we are not looters 
as we are accused theyre just playing their cards 
the hearing going into its 10th day technically is on a 
government motion to dismiss keatings suit alleging that the 
seizing of lincoln last year by regulators was capricious and 
arbitrary 
judith wischer who headed the daytoday operation of keatings 
real estate and thrift empire as president of american continental 
lincolns parent company testified tuesday that confidential 
information about lincoln and its loans was repeatedly leaked by 
the bank board to journalists 
results of a 1986 exam of the bank were published in the wall 
street journal and the mesa arizona tribune four months before 
lincoln was officials notified of them she said 
you read about them in the newspaper thats the way you were 
advised of the exam sporkin asked incredulously 
thats the way we were advised of the exam mrs wischer 
replied 
it was only through press reports she said that american 
continental learned much later that the examiners in may 1987 also 
had recommended to bank board officials in washington that the 
government take over lincoln then 
that recommendation fell on deaf ears for nearly two years 
during that time officials now contend the cost to taxpayers of 
covering lincolns loss of federally insured deposits to soured 
real estate loans doubled to nearly 2 billion 
just a month before the may 1987 recommendation the san 
francisco regulatory officials in charge of lincolns audit were 
summoned to washington to meet with the five senators 
the five sens alan cranston dcalif dennis deconcini 
dariz john mccain rariz john glenn dohio and donald w 
riegle jr dmich have all denied trying to influence the 
regulators improperly all are now under investigation by the 
senate ethics committee

defense secretary dick cheney preparing to ask 
the united states pacific allies to contribute more toward their 
own defense said tuesday that the soviet union remains a 
formidable power in the area 
what it may be losing in numbers it is gaining back in terms 
of more modern capable ships and advanced weaponry cheney told 
the pacific and asian affairs council 
the soviet foreign ministry announced last month that it was 
withdrawing some of the mig23 fighters and tu16 bombers stationed 
at cam ranh bay described by us military sources as the soviets 
largest foreign base 
reminding his listeners of the profound shock felt when the 
japanese bombed pearl harbor cheney argued that the united states 
must maintain its military strength to remain a global power and to 
protect its interests in the pacific 
he said that 35 percent of americas world trade is with east 
asian and pacific nations 
from hawaii cheney was heading for south korea and discussions 
with officials about increasing their support for the 43000 us 
troops stationed there 
in all cheney is spending two weeks in the pacific meeting 
with representatives of hong kong the philippines and japan in 
light of congressional pressure for paring the defense budget and 
for larger allied contributions to the costs of keeping us forces 
in asia 
cheney said south korea contributes 300 million a year to 
maintaining the us force there the seoul government on the 
other hadn has estimated its share of the us expenses at more 
than 2 billion 
cheney arranged for a special state department representative to 
accompany him as he asks allies with booming economies to kick in 
more toward the cost of maintaining us forces in asia 
the defense secretary noted that the soviets maintain more than 
a halfmillion ground troops in asia dozens of air divisions and 
one of its largest naval fleets numbering more than 260 ships and 
submarines 
overall there are 120000 us troops in asia and hawaii a 
force some members of congress say is too large 
on tuesday cheney said that while he had no plans to 
dramatically alter our posture in the pacific he could not 
rule out prospects for adjustments in our deployments or in the 
overall size of our forces

a decision by aflcio officials to skip a vote 
on abortion at next weeks annual meeting may mean the federations 
hierarchy ultimately will remain neutral on the issue prochoice 
union leaders say 
others such as duke mcvey president of the missouri state 
labor council aflcio say the abortion issue has nothing to do 
with 40 hours a week or 20 bucks an hour 
we have enough to say grace over without taking on the 
abortion issue it splits our members and it doesnt address wages 
hours or conditions of employment mcvey said 
jay foreman executive vice president of the united food and 
commerical workers international union said the question is 
whether the union hierarchy wants to take any risks 
the majority of them are male he said theyre not 
children theyre getting up there in years and are kind of fixed 
in their attitudes they may not want to bite on this 
aflcio president lane kirkland has told the federations 
33member executive council which meets next week in bal harbour 
fla that he wants a committee to determine whether the federation 
should take a prochoice stand or stay neutral there is no 
organized move to condemn abortion 
three of the councils 33 members are women 
some prochoice union forces say that if the council chooses to 
stay on the sidelines as the aflcio has been urged in a national 
right to life letterwriting campaign organized labors efforts 
to attract women will be damaged 
if theyre going to keep the women and minorities active 
theyre going to have to come out of the dark ages arlene 
collins first vice president of the oregon aflcio said tuesday 
many union officials regardless of their position on abortion 
agree that organizing women and minorities are key if labor is to 
reverse the loss in stature it suffered in the 1980s 
collins said she is concerned that if the council continues to 
delay taking a stand as it has done for more than a decade the 
issue wont have as much impact on the 1990 politial races 
but others say abortion wont serve as a litmus test for 
candidates 
its not critical to the election cycle were not a single 
issues group foreman said 
still he and other prochoice labor leaders think the aflcio 
should commit on the issue because they say abortion has workplace 
ramifications such as affecting the economic wellbeing of working 
women and raising questions of healthcare coverage and the ability 
of healthcare workers to do their job 
mcvey said a number of rankandfile union members feel very 
strongly about the issue they dont support their union doing that 
kind of activity and they dont want to pay dues to a union that 
does 
yet several prochoice union leaders noted the aflcio 
historically has gotten involved in issues not directly related to 
collective bargaining such as civil rights gay rights and school 
busing 
delegates from all 90 aflcio unions declined last fall to adopt 
any of the half dozen prochoice resolutions submitted referring 
them to the executive council 
adoption of such a resolution would put the federation in line 
with the stance taken by many of its political allies such as the 
democratic party and various womens and civil rights groups 
william wynn president of the ufcw and a prochoice member of 
the council will chair the committee that will determine whether 
the federation should take a position 
kirkland has not given the committee a deadline but wynn 
predicted it will be able to come to a definitive conclusion that 
will be responsive to everybodys feelings everybodys emotions

invasion of the county in 1965 bosch has been ahead in recent 
polls 
balaguer was first elected in 1965 four years after dictator

womenonly chatham college is considering 
admitting men for the first time at least partly to attract women 
trustee louis b barnes said one factor behind mondays proposal 
was apprehension that young women would look elsewhere for their 
education he called the process of getting 18yearold women to 
apply to a femaleonly college a tough sell 
theres a socalled stigma attached to a singlesex college 
barnes said many modern young women choose to go to coed 
colleges they are at least as interested in their social existence 
as their academic existence 
chathams board of trustees approved a resolution backed by 
president rebecca stafford which would open the doors of the 
school to men next year for the first time the proposal came from 
the boards longrange planning committee which includes faculty 
and alumnae 
a final decision will be made at the boards spring meeting in 
april 
weve increased enrollment we want to increase it even more 
especially traditionalaged students ms stafford said we 
want to increase the student body so we can offer more courses 
chatham college was founded in 1869 it has about 650 women 
enrolled

sen howard metzenbaum on tuesday criticized 
pension raiding by corporations that terminate employee 
retirement plans to gain surplus assets and turn over the pensions 
to companies holding junk bonds 
pension raids leave workers and retirees with frozen pension 
checks while their employers lugh their way to the bank with 
millions of dollars said metzenbaum an ohio democrat 
metzenbaums comments came as his senate labor subcommittee held 
a hearing on pension terminations and the potential risks from 
companies establishing replacement retirement programs with 
annuities bought from insurance companies heavily invested in 
highrisk junk bonds 
annuities are contracts that pay fixed monthly benefits to 
retirees 
surplus pension assets have become a popular target for 
corporate raiders who acquire a company and use its retirement 
programs as a source of cash 
metzenbaum focused on a proposal by the kansasbased coleman co 
to terminate employee pension funds valued at 83 million and a 
scrapped deal to buy annuities from first executive corp a 
california insurance holding company hit by financial downturns 
from turmoil in the junkbond market 
he also cited the takeover of californiabased pacific lumber 
co in 1986 by maxxam group inc which replaced an employee 
pension fund with an annuity bought from first executive and took 
control of about 50 million in surplus pension assets 
we are very worried about our pension and feel we didnt get a 
fair deal pacific lumber worker lester reynolds of fortuna 
calif told the panel 
metzenbaum said the subcommittee would consider legislation to 
impose tighter standards on pension terminations and provide 
greater protection for retirement benefits 
too often sound pension plans are wrung dry of their cash and 
replaced with annuities offering fixed benefits and no chance of 
costofliving adjustments metzenbaum said these annuities 
are backed by an underregulated insurance industry that plays fast 
and loose with everything from accounting methods to capital 
standards 
metzenbaum suggested that colemans corporate parent macandrews 
amp forbes holding inc had a potential conflict of interest in 
doing business with first executive and may have violated federal 
standards in failing to adequately safeguard the interests of 
retirees 
first executive metzenbaum said had 310 million in bonds of 
revlon inc a subsidiary of macandrews amp forbes 
coleman officials said they had acted properly 
it is my belief that the company has acted in every step 
in good faith and with full appreciation of applicable fiduciary 
obligations said coleman president larry jones 
coleman was acquired in april by macandrews amp forbes controlled 
by takeover specialist ronald o perelman wichitabased coleman is 
one of the worlds largest makers of outdoor recreation equipment 
because colemans pension plans are overfunded macandrews amp 
forbes will be able to take up to 32 million in surplus money for 
its own use by terminating the pensions and setting up an annuity 
program 
a macandrews amp forbes official said the surplus would be closer 
to 20 million after taxes and that all of the money would be 
reinvested to expand and modernize coleman finance a new employee 
retirement savings program and develop new products and markets 
our retirees will not suffer one pennys loss as a result of 
this transaction said howard gittis vice chairman of new 
yorkbased macandrews amp forbes 
coleman has scuttled its deal with first executive and officials 
told the subcommittee that it had secured the return of a 45 
million premium deposit 
coleman officials said they would proceed with their termination 
plan but would buy annuities from an insurance company carrying the 
highest rating of claimspaying ability

only the messages have changed on those 
familiar valentines day staples conversation hearts skidoo 
and oh you kid have given way to luv ya and lets rock 
the medium small colored candy hearts remains the same 
the new england confectionery company better known as necco 
originated conversation hearts at the turn of the century it 
ceased production in 1920 but revived them six years ago when 
company officials decided they had become popular again 
today its valentines day yearround at the companys huge 
nondescript building necco churns out 17 billion conversation 
hearts a year and is believed to be the leader among several 
companies that make them 
i think people today in spite of what they say about them 
are more interested in talking about their thoughts and feelings 
than we ever were said charles welsford systems manager of the 
necco company 
candy has long been a way of expression between people people 
love conversation hearts he said tuesday 
necco makes the hearts on the same machines that produced them 
in the early 1900s on one floor of the sprawling plant dozens of 
white uniformed employees scurry around a maze of huge vats of 
sugar rollers and conveyor belts 
necco which also makes chocolates and a series of candy bars 
makes conversation hearts from the same ingredients as its famous 
necco wafers a mixture of sugar corn syrup and dextrose 
its a simple process the conversation hearts are almost 100 
percent sugar which is blended into a paste in large troughs the 
mixture is then rolled onto a conveyor belt like a blanket where a 
printing mechanism engraves the sayings onto the paste a cutter 
mold which operates at 145 strokes a minute cuts out 37 hearts 
per stroke during each eighthour shift 
the tiny hearts are the most popular but necco also makes a 
slightly larger version as well 
i know theyre popular because its not even valentines day 
and were already out of them jean philippe simonet manager of 
the fanny farmer candy shop in boston said tuesday 
necco employee anthony staropoli says he never tires of them 
and hes been working at the plant for 43 years 
people are crazy for them said staropoli when they hear 
i work here i have to give bags to everyone 
welsford said neccos approximately 700 employees are asked to 
contribute ideas for the messages printed on the hearts a total of 
25 phrases are chosen none of which will win awards for ingenuity 
or cleverness a sampling dig me stay loose buzz off 
cool or far out 
but welsford defends them pointing out that any of them can 
be given to any youngster without explanation 
and yes some of the hearts contain that one message that hasnt 
changed over the years and never needs an explanation i love 
you

the big question tuesday in the society soap 
opera of trump vs trump was a legal one how solid is a prenuptial 
agreement between donald and ivana 
under it mrs trump would be limited to custody of their three 
children their greenwich conn mansion and 25 million 
but donald trump is worth 17 billion by fortune magazines 
estimate and new york post gossip columnist cindy adams reported 
that ivana trump wants 150 million the plaza hotel and her 
husbands 727 jetliner 
the real estate magnate and his wife signed an agreement before 
their marriage 13 years ago limiting ivanas share in case of a 
divorce the agreement was updated at least twice the last time 
two years ago 
last summer ivana asked the prominent divorce lawyer raoul 
felder whether the agreement could be broken he told her to forget 
it 
the law doesnt protect you from making a bad deal felder 
said this week adding that the trumps agreement isnt even 
prenuptial its postnuptial 
new york courts are known for their respect for prenuptial 
agreements in the absence of evidence that there was not a full 
and fair disclosure of the assets at stake 
but mrs trumps lawyer michael kennedy said we do not 
consider the socalled prenuptial agreement to be serious it will 
have no relevance to a court because it is unconscionable and 
fraudulent 
and adams who says she has known trump when he was straight 
out of school and in his early dating days asked who of us 
knows what properties could have been undervalued or overvalued for 
varying purposes right 
her conclusion donald knows hes about to get hit 
trumps spokesman was adamant the prenuptial agreement signed 
by donald and ivana trump is a long and detailed document which 
covers all aspects and is 100 percent enforceable in courts of 
law 
trump in wilmington del on tuesday to promote the second 
tour de trump bicycle race repeatedly said no questions when 
asked to comment on the breakup 
asked later if he planned to rename the helicopter that bears 
his wifes name the developer laughed heartily but refused to 
comment 
although published reports had linked trump romantically to a 
number of women actress marla maples moved ahead tuesday as the 
new york tabloid newspapers favorite candidate for the role of the 
other woman 
in an aspen colo restaurant over the holidays mrs trump 
reportedly warned maples to stay away from her husband 
maples reportedly told her i love him and if you dont why 
dont you let him go 
a source who had heard a firsthand account of the meeting told 
the post that mrs trump cursed at the actress and mispronounced 
her name as moolah 
trump told his wife afterward youre overreacting 
other trump allegations reports and rumors filled the tabloids 
donald had ivana locked out of her office monday at the plaza 
hotel but then let her in 
donald and ivana had an hourlong meeting alone at the hotel 
some of ivanas jewelry was missing and she suspected donald 
took it from their vault 
the headline writers did their bit with ivana be alone 
newsday ivana better deal daily news and gimme the 
plaza post the news used the overline trump the war over 
its three pages of trump coverage 
even leona helmsley the selfdescribed hotel queen got into 
the act 
hes obsessed with me isnt he mrs helmsley said to a 
reporter then why would he push her ivana to be just like me 
to run his hotels really 
donald had been quoted as telling a source that ivanas level 
of arrogance has grown steadily worse in recent years the bottom 
line is i dont want to create another leona helmsley 
mrs helmsley who was recently convicted of tax evasion was 
described at her trial as illtempered and demanding 
i have told ivana whatever leona would do do the opposite 
be nice to everybody and she is nice anyway trump said in an 
interview published in the march issue of playboy magazine

dry soil conditions and lack of snow cover in 
parts of the great plains continue to threaten winter wheat the 
governments joint agricultural weather facility said tuesday 
portions of the southern great plains received some moisture 
but more was needed the facility said in its report for the week 
of feb 410 most of the central and northern great plains 
remained dry but abovenormal temperatures helped to maintain crop 
condition 
the facility is operated by the departments of agriculture and 
commerce the weekly reports cover soil and crop conditions but do 
not project yields 
looking at some other crops the report said the sugarcane 
harvest continued in florida but that unseasonably hot dry 
weather forced citrus producers to continue irrigating 
the warm weather also continued over the major florida vegetable 
areas where spring plantings were under way 
in georgia tobacco plant beds were reported in good to 
excellent condition and that north carolina farmers continued to 
seed their beds 
rain and wet field conditions again limited field work in the 
delta the report said land preparation for the 1990 cotton 
crop continued in arizona and california 
livestock pastures were helped by rain and mild temperatures in 
the delta and southeast the report said 
in the great plains and corn belt mild temperatures and the 
lack of snow cover reduced the amount of supplemental feeding 
necessary for livestock the report said mild weather 
provided ideal conditions for calving which was under way in many 
areas

president bush may use the fournation drug 
summit to revive the idea shunned in latin america of using 
us military forces to cast a radar net over colombia to track 
cocainecarrying aircraft a senior adviser said tuesday 
brent scowcroft bushs national security adviser said the idea 
was on the shelf for the moment because colombian officials 
balked last year at news reports that the united states was 
considering a naval blockade of their ports 
scowcroft said the plan probably would not win approval in the 
next several days the summit is thursday but he added that 
its an idea we think has merit he said i expect it might 
be discussed at the summit 
another administration official speaking anonymously played 
down the sensitive subject calling it not a significant agenda 
item 
bush after a predawn flight from washington on thursday will 
join the leaders of colombia bolivia and peru in the coastal 
resort of cartagena for six hours of drugfighting talks 
the summit site at a heavily guarded naval base isolated on a 
peninsula was selected to provide maximum protection in a nation 
torn by drugrelated violence 
underscoring the hazards police reported tuesday that leftist 
guerrillas had kidnapped two americans in the drug capital of 
medellin colombia to protest bushs visit they were identified 
as david kent a teacher from indianapolis and james donnelly 
employed by a company that manufactures hydraulic equipment 
colombian authorities say about 5000 security agents will be on 
hand for the presidents protection at the summit 
to bolster security two american warships have been deployed in 
the caribbean along with a colombian escort ship 
the us vessels are the uss nassau an 820foot amphibious 
assault ship which carries helicopters and a marine landing team 
and the uss sampson a 437foot destroyer armed with missiles and 
two fiveinch guns 
acknowledging risks involved in the trip scowcroft said its 
an unusual situation because there are in colombia these guerrilla 
bands terrorist bands with access to funds to purchase any 
kinds of arms and so naturally there are unusual circumstances 
however he said all the agencies involved in presidential 
security are comfortable with the arrangements 
in preparation for the summit bush called in senior advisers in 
the drug war including attorney general dick thornburgh drug 
policy director william bennett cia director william webster drug 
enforcement administration director john lawn gen colin powell 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff trade representative carla 
hills and health and human services secretary louis sullivan 
bush also signed a new united nations compact aimed at helping 
curb international drug traffic and urged other nations to do the 
same to join us in working together to rid the world of this 
menace the menace from drugs 
the united states is the fifth nation to ratify the agreement 
tentatively approved by 76 countries the un convention against 
illegal traffic in narcotic drugs calls upon all nations to make 
illegal the production cultivation and transportation of narcotics 
and other dangerous drugs 
it also calls for tighter controls on chemicals used in drug 
production and sets up guidelines for extraditing drug offenders 
seizing drugtainted assets and curbing money laundering 
scowcroft at a briefing on the summit said the united states 
never planned a naval blockade of colombia 
instead he said the plan envisioned using offshore facilities 
to erect a radar screen that will give the colombians the ability 
to target where the loaded plans are coming from going up to north 
america and where the empty planes are coming back in and so 
forth 
scowcroft said we would be interested in improved cooperation 
in that kind of interdiction a day earlier bush said what 
id like to convince them is we can be extraordinarily helpful 
particularly to colombia in their courageous fight against 
narcotraffickers by a sophisticated interdiction effort 
scowcroft said the four leaders will sign a communique covering 
us economic assistance to the andean nations as well as aid from 
international financial institutions 
it also will call for reducing the demand for drugs in the 
united states curbing us export of chemicals such as ether used 
to manufacture cocaine from coca leaves and will deal with the 
export of us weapons to the region and with money laundering he 
said 
commenting on a dispute with colombia concerning coffee and 
cutflower trade scowcroft offered little hope that progress would 
be made on resolving such disagreements at the drug summit 
later however bennett said the subjects were open to 
discussion 
colombian president virgilio barco has complained to bush that 
the us commerce department is engaged in a trade procedure 
against colombian flower growers that could result in big tariffs 
on colombiangrown cut flowers 
scowcroft said there is nothing the administration can do about 
the matter which he described as a regulatory procedure taken 
after us flower growers protested that colombia was dumping 
flowers in this country at belowfairmarket prices

civilians fled on foot through deep snow 
tuesday to escape a ski resort area they fear will be the next 
battleground of the rival armies fighting for control of lebanons 
christian territory 
kesrouan province in the mountains north of beirut is noted for 
both summer and winter resorts but also is the main stronghold of 
samir geagea and his lebanese forces the largest christian militia 
michel aoun the rebel general whose 19000 soldiers been trying 
to destroy geagea for more than two weeks described the militia as 
an unacceptable tumor in our body and called up reserves and 
volunteers 
police said aoun was massing troops along kesrouans eastern 
flank and its southern coastal area near jounieh a port 12 miles 
north of beirut for an apparent twopronged thrust 
his troopers and geageas militiamen fought intermittent 
artillery and mortar duels tuesday in christian east beirut and in 
kesrouan 
aouns command reported 15 soldiers in combat in two days and 
police said 18 corpses were taken from the streets of east beirut 
where snipers are active 
at least 513 people have been killed and 1724 wounded since the 
battle began jan 30 according to police figures 
snow was 20 inches deep in the mountains tuesday and more was 
falling police said dozens of exhausted civilians slogged to 
villages away from the potential field of battle 
many civilians have reached central kesrouan with cases of 
exhaustion after crossing the deep valleys on foot said a police 
spokesman whose name cannot be used under standing regulations 
unfortunately there is nothing we can do to help we cant 
send patrols to evacuate them because bridges have been blown up 
and other narrow roads have been either mined or blocked by snow 
in an attempt to limit aouns ability to maneuver militiamen 
have blown up all bridges linking the mountains he controls in the 
east to central and western kesrouan the spokesman said 
geageas men also have planted antitank mines along most narrow 
mountain roads in the province to block any advance 
aoun who commands about 19000 men said he was willing to give 
geagea a political role in the 310squaremile christian enclave 
north and east of beirut but also indicated he was ready for a 
showdown 
he said army would be the only armed group permitted to operate 
in the enclave where 1 million christians live 
they are welcome if they want political responsibility aoun 
told a news conference at his headquarters bunker beneath the 
shattered presidential palace in baabda a christian suburb east of 
beirut 
they should be integrated into an official apparatus he 
said they are an unacceptable tumor in our body aoun said 
but added we are ready to give them a chance in times of major 
crisis one should be ready to take valiant decisions to avoid more 
victims and more tragedies 
aoun has retained his command in defiance of president elias 
hrawi who dismissed him as army chief after being elected in 
november with a mandate to implement a peace plan designed to end 
the 15yearold civil war the general rejects the peace plan and 
refuses to leave the presidential palace 
his remarks tuesday about the lebanese forces amounted to a 
restatement of conditions he outlined when the battle began that 
the militia be disbanded transformed into a political party 
geagea has rejected the offer as an effort to eliminate us 
he noted that his militia which has about 6000 regulars and 
thousands of reservists has fought lebanese moslems palestinians 
and syrians during the long civil war 
aoun accused the lebanese forces of stabbing the army in the 
back and said his forces had achieved the minimum we are 
capable of doing his reference was to the battle for the 
strategic dbaye hills north of beirut which his men captured early 
last week

schools closed for a week by a racial protest 
reopened tuesday amid heavy security including 200 national 
guardsmen sent by gov guy hunt absenteeism was high but officials 
reported no classroom problems 
about 150 black student protesters boycotted selma high school 
and marched around a flagpole chanting shut em down no 
school before the opening bell another two dozen protesters 
continued a sitin at city hall for a seventh day outside some 
carried signs saying equality education 
this is the first time troopers have been used to ensure that 
whites could go to school said jamie wallace executive director 
of the selma chamber of commerce 
the protest prompted by the dismissal of the citys first black 
school superintendent by white school board members was less 
strident than in recent days when throngs of black demonstrators 
rekindled images of historic selma marches in the 1960s 
the superintendent norward roussell who was reinstated last 
week called for racial unity tuesday but he said he doubted the 
conflict will end until there is some movement on my contract 
which expires in june 
his supporters contend he is being dismissed because of his race 
and action he took on behalf of black students not because of an 
alleged lack of managerial skills cited in an evaluation he has 
held the 80000 post for 2 years 
protesters also want the school board with six whites and five 
blacks to be elected rather than appointed by the city council 
which has five whites and four blacks the city is 52 percent black 
it saddens me that children have to be pulled into a political 
and racial conflict that should have been solved years ago after 
the edmund pettus bridge said roussell he referred to the selma 
bridge where marchers were clubbed by state troopers in 1965 in 
what became known as bloody sunday a milestone in the drive 
for equal rights 
hunt agreed to dispatch 200 military police from national guard 
reserve ranks to join an undisclosed number of state troopers and 
local police in guarding selmas 11 public schools which closed 
feb 7 amid rising racial tensions the system with 5971 
students is about 70 percent black and some white parents have 
moved their children to private schools or other systems during the 
past week 
there is no reason for all this security because they didnt 
come here to be violent said dallas county commissioner perry 
varner a black protest leader who was arrested in a melee in the 
mayors office last week 
roussell said about 23 percent of the students were absent 
tuesday he said he had predicted 30 percent would stay home 
because of uncertainty over the school environment 
both black and white parents seriously want their chidren back 
in schools said roussell who has opposed student boycotts even 
when they were conducted in support of him i want to commend 
parents both black and white for sending their children back to 
school we dont need a superintendent over empty schools and 
classrooms 
he said the situation in the schools was reasonably calm 
with two boys both black in a shoving match at a middle school 
he said 54 students were withdrawn from schools tuesday but he 
believes most will return once they see were open and things are 
going smoothly 
i want to emphasize that were not having a mass exodus of 
whites from our schools he said 
the protesting students marched about a mile to the high school 
tuesday morning and at one point the marchers had a brief 
confrontation with state troopers 
several troopers told the marchers they needed to stay away from 
the school prompting the marchers to stop and pray with troopers 
taking off their hats during the prayer the students then moved 
through the troopers who did not try to physically restrain them

more than 750000 people were shot to death as 
enemies of the state during stalins 193053 reign of terror the 
kgb secret police said in a report tuesday 
the figure does not include the millions who died in labor camps 
and prisons or in the famines during stalins collectivization of 
agriculture but it represented the first time the kgb has given a 
figure for any of stalins victims 
many western sources say that altogether more than 10 million 
people were killed 
under president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms government 
commissions and the kgb have been ordered to find the truth about 
stalins terror and rehabilitate the victims 
gorbachevs kgb director vladimir a kryuchkov has pledged to 
never again permit the secret police to be involved in such 
repression 
the official tass news agency quoted a kgb committee as saying a 
review of its archives determined that 3778234 people had been 
sentenced for counterrevolutionary activities or crimes against the 
state from 1930 to 1953 when stalin died 
it said 786098 of them including many top state and party 
leaders scientists military leaders and cultural figures had 
been shot to death 
most leading figures such as bolshevik leader nikolai i 
bukharin who was shot at the height of the terror in 1938 have 
since been cleared of any crimes 
the tass report said the cases of more than 850000 people had 
been reconsidered by the kgb and the soviet prosecutors office the 
past two years and that all but about 12000 had been cleared 
the kgb said it was continuing to look for the mass graves where 
stalins victims were buried to place memorials there such graves 
have been uncovered in many regions of the country in recent years 
but it charged that many local kgb offices were not helping 
uncover the truth about innocent victims in their areas 
the kgb has been trying to improve its public image and in 
recent months it has gone on a publicity offensive presenting some 
of its top officers for a television callin program and allowing a 
film to be made about its operations 
during the 1970s the kgb harassed soviet dissidents and now say 
they were only carrying out the policies required of them at the 
time 
as the agencys role has changed in society kryuchkov has 
called for closer cooperation between the kgb and intelligence 
agencies in the west to fight drug trafficking and terrorism

sexually assaulted her 
us district judge sam cummings on monday threw out the lawsuit 
filed by wanda lee nichols who accused bowie of assaulting her in 
his hotel room on oct 9 1987 during a fourday concert stopover 
in dallas 
bowie conceded he had spent the night with ms nichols but 
denied accusations he sexually assaulted her a grand jury declined 
to indict bowie on nov 18 1987 
ms nichols asked a judge to have bowie tested to see if he 
carried the aids virus although her attorney had said she already 
had tested negative for exposure to the virus herself 
bowie subsequently tested negative for aids in switzerland and 
mailed the results to dallas 
dallas lawyer daniel p callahan who represented bowie in the 
suit said the judges decision to dismiss the lawsuit on monday 
was the appropriate result

federal job training programs fail to serve 
enough hispanics because of income and documentation barriers a 
government report said tuesday 
the national commission for employment policy an independent 
agency that reports to congress and the president said the federal 
job training partnership act needs to be amended so more hispanics 
will participate 
the report based on a 12month study called on congress to 
ease income requirements it also asked the labor department to 
urge states to loosen documentation requirements needed to get into 
job training programs 
while hispanics account for between 13 percent and 14 percent of 
those eligible for job training programs they make up only between 
10 percent and 11 percent of those who take part the report said 
the commission blamed part of the discrepancy on federal 
requirements that mandate candidates for the program be receiving 
food stamps many hispanics refuse to accept public assistance and 
therefore miss out on job training oppurtunities the report said 
because of their cultural heritage of selfsufficiency and 
attendant distaste for government assistance programs many 
hispanics would rather forego jtpa training than accept food stamp 
assistance just to qualify for the program the agency said 
the report recommended that congress change the law so that 
candidates merely be eligible for food stamps rather than 
actually accepting the assistance 
under current law receiving food stamps is one way to be 
eligible for jtpa there are also job training income cutoff 
levels which are higher in some areas than the food stamp 
qualification 
that means some working poor hispanics have income levels that 
fall between the two levels which keeps them from meeting the jtpa 
cutoff but qualifys them for food stamps 
congress needs to make the two income levels compatible so that 
hispanics falling between the two income levels who choose not to 
take food stamps can still receive job training the report said 
in addition the commission said requirements on documents such 
as birth certificates are overly restrictive in some areas such as 
miami where there are a large number of political refugees 
maybe some of us still have our birth certificate sitting in a 
drawer some place but for these people in order to get a birth 
certificate they have to get it from the very government they 
fled said carol romero the staff economist who oversaw the 
report 
the labor department should urge states to consider ways to ease 
documentation requirements the report said

districts by a ceasefire line after a war in 194849 a campaign 
for secession for india began shortly after and turned violent in

opposition legislators shouted prime minister 
margaret thatcher down tuesday when she defended easing sanctions 
against south africa and the labor party leader called her 
absurd and arrogant 
more uproar came during question time in the house of commons 
when a legislator said referring to mrs thatcher if shed just 
spent 27 years in jail 
and so she should interjected gerald kaufman labors 
spokesman on foreign affairs 
neil kinnock the labor party leader said mrs thatcher was 
absurd and arrogant for seeking to ease sanctions that had to 
support of nelson mandela the black leader freed sunday after 
serving more than 27 years in prison 
when kinnock referred to mandelas support for sanctions mrs 
thatcher accused labor of taking its instructions from the 
african national congress guerrilla organization after loud 
protests mrs thatcher withdrew the remark 
mr mandela also said he approved of armed struggle she 
said i disagree with him on that and i disagree with him on the 
present sanctions 
she remained standing for question time sometimes trying to 
shout above the noise and sometimes silent as opposition 
legislators yelled and jeered her own conservative party members 
shouted back at labor across the green leather benches of the 
commons 
speaker bernard weatherill called repeatedly for order 
this sounds awful he protested ive never heard the 
house behave in this way at question time 
mrs thatcher said both the labor party and anc believed in 
comprehensive economic sanctions against south africas white 
government in the armed struggle against it and in widespread 
nationalization of industry 
mr mandela naturally said he supports all three in what i 
would call his ritual speech she said referring to mandelas 
remarks sunday to huge crowd in cape town i believe he is making 
very much better and more peaceful speeches during his subsequent 
press conferences 
on sunday mandela said the armed struggle and international 
sanctions should continue until the whiteled south african 
government finally abolished apartheid 
this month mrs thatcher will seek to get the 12nation 
european community to drop a ban on new investment and on promoting 
tourism to south africa both voluntary measures she has hinted 
she will go ahead alone if necessary 
the prime minister says president fw de klerk should be 
rewarded for freeing mandela and legalizing the anc as a prelude to 
negotiating a new constitution enfranchising blacks who outnumber 
south africas whites by more than 5 to 1 
her officials say de klerk risks being ousted in a white 
backlash unless he can show anxious south african whites some 
response from the outside world 
there is little support for mrs thatchers stance in the 
european community and president bush is prevented by law from 
lifting sanctions until specific reforms are adopted 
in the commons she said president bush has made clear that 
he does not think that sanctions are necessarily right answer in 
this situation he is bound by a law passed by congress in so far 
as we are bound by laws we will be 
the european community has banned member states from importing 
iron steel or gold coins to south africa and from exporting oil to 
it the united states european community and japan are south 
africas major trading partners

a woman was jailed for civil contempt of court 
tuesday after refusing to testify before a federal grand jury 
investigating mayor marion barry 
us district judge john garrett penn granted immunity from 
prosecution to maria mccarthy of greensboro nc after she 
initially refused to discuss barry with the grand jury said her 
attorney leslie scherr 
when she still declined to testify she was ordered jailed said 
scherr 
the grand jury is investigating barrys ties to former city 
employee charles lewis who has cooperated with the panel after 
pleading guilty to two cocaine conspiracy charges lewis testified 
in open court that he supplied barry with crack cocaine 
the federal investigation began in december 1988 after city 
police aborted an undercover drug purchase from lewis when they 
discovered that barry was in his downtown washington hotel room 
barry who is enrolled in a florida substance abuse treatment 
center after being arrested jan 18 on a misdemeanor cocaine 
possession charge has denied using drugs with lewis 
in another development tuesday us magistrate deborah robinson 
ruled that barry does not have to undergo a urinalysis while he is 
at the florida clinic however the magistrate said that barry must 
be tested within 12 hours of his departure from the clinic in west 
palm beach 
weekly tests were a condition of barrys original release from 
custody on jan 19 the us attorneys office submitted a motion 
on monday asking that barry leave the clinic to be tested weekly at 
a courtapproved facility authorities said that barry had not been 
tested at the clinic since his arrival on jan 22 
scherr said mccarthy explained her decision not to testify by 
telling him i have to live with myself whether he was a friend 
or enemy we had a relationship that doesnt need public scrutiny 
the attorney declined to say whether mccarthy had been referring 
to barry but two city government sources said that barry and 
mccarthy had had a personal relationship 
scherr said mccarthy had authorized him to reveal that she knows 
rasheeda moore the woman who cooperated with the fbi sting 
operation that resulted in barrys arrest scherr declined to 
provide further details about mccarthys connection to moore or the 
mayor 
mccarthy is the second woman jailed for civil contempt for 
refusing to discuss her relationship with barry karen johnson 
served eight months in jail in 1984 
under law mccarthy can be hel in jail as long as the grand jury 
hearing evidence in the case remains in session grand juries are 
normally empaneled for 18 months at a time but can be extended if 
the case continues

the head of the us information agency tried 
to fire the director of the voice of america last week but the 
white house said voas richard carlson still enjoyed president 
bushs confidence officials said tuesday 
one government source close to the situation speaking only on 
condition of anonymity described a confrontation between usia 
director bruce gelb and carlson over a decision last month to 
eliminate six of voas 43 language services in an effort to save 3 
million 
white house personnel director chase untermeyer while declining 
to go into the question of any dispute between gelb and carlson 
said tuesday that he had met in recent days with the two both 
presidential appointees whose nominations had been approved by the 
senate 
gelb is a personal friend of bush and a campaign fund raiser 
and untermeyer said carlson was held over from the reagan 
administration proof that he has our support 
while declining to discuss what he had told the two men 
untermeyer did say that now all is calm at usia 
fiftyseven people would lose their jobs if the uzbek swahili 
lao slovenian greek and turkish services go off the air as 
announced this spring and summer 
the cuts were approved by gelb spokesman frank johnson said 
before carlson announced the decision to employees two weeks ago 
gelb approved the plan but he wasnt comfortable with it 
johnson said 
the usia director was out of town when carlson met with the voa 
employees johnson said when gelb returned and read news accounts 
of the decision he was extremely upset said one participant at a 
meeting of senior agency officials convened by gelb 
the usia director claimed he knew nothing about it the 
decision he was almost hysterical he claimed we tricked him 
said the source 
johnson gelbs spokesman said the usia director proposed that 
funds be transferred from voas construction account to keep the 
six services operating in what johnson called one last attempt to 
solve the problem 
carlson and gelbs senior aides objected saying that the 
construction budget was already squeezed and that any transfer of 
funds could jeopardize transmitter projects around the world said 
the source 
carlson also said that transferring funds from one account to 
another would require the approval of congress which had rejected 
such a solution in preliminary discussions of voas budgetary 
dilemma the source said 
but gelb pressed his solution berated carlson for failing to 
support him and told the voa chief last thursday that he was fired 
the source said 
gelb also told aides to cancel carlsons sunday departure for 
israel and talks with israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir about a 
300 million transmitter the voa wants to build in israel to 
improve its transmissions to the soviet union and eastern europe 
at that point the white house weighed in 
one source said that it was agreed they would try to work out 
their differences johnson said simply that gelb and carlson 
enjoy a professional and worklike relationship voa spokeswoman 
beth knisely said carlson has not resigned and he has not been 
fired 
on tuesday shortly before he left for israel carlson met with 
voa employees to deny rumors that hed been fired and said one 
participant to tell them the white house was pleased with the job 
voa was doing 
as for the announced cutbacks voa officials are now exploring 
whether congress will approve the transfer of funds to keep the six 
foreign language services operating

nelson mandelas support for 
guerrilla violence has not been helpful but white leaders 
agree with the need for black voting rights a government minister 
said tuesday 
gerrit viljoen the constitutional development minister said 
mandelas organization the african national congress appears 
confused over how to respond to the reforms of president fw de 
klerk 
mandela the countrys best known black leader was freed sunday 
after more than 27 years in prison he has said negotiations with 
the white government could begin soon but he still supports the 
anc sabotage campaign he helped launch in 1961 
viljoen whose job is to negotiate a new constitution that will 
enfranchise the 28 million blacks said the government agrees with 
mandela on several major issues 
the government accepts the principle of universal franchise 
and an end to apartheid he told a news conference but 
mandelas remarks on the armed struggle have not been helpful 
the government is not prepared to accede to the handing over 
of power if that is the goal of the armed struggle then there is 
no meaningful way ahead 
he said the governments power to maintain law and order is 
quite considerable 
anc policy dates back several decades and the 
organization remains wedded to such failed policies as a 
socialistoriented economy he said 
on feb 2 de klerk legalized the anc and more than 60 other 
opposition groups the anc says it still is considering a formal 
response to the speech 
it seems at the moment that there is some confusion and 
contradiction in the responses of the anc viljoen said and 
urged it to cooperate in the process of negotiations and not just 
set new conditions 
de klerks government says it wants to bring blacks into the 
national government within five years but says a oneman onevote 
democracy would result in black domination of the 5 million whites

the presidents of peru and bolivia say they 
will ask the united states at the drug summit thursday for money to 
help farmers switch from coca the raw material of cocaine to 
growing other crops 
presidents alan garcia of peru jaime paz zamora of bolivia and 
virgilio barco of colombia are to meet president bush in cartagena 
colombia on thursday to discuss the drugtrafficking problem 
garcia said tuesday he will request help for peruvian farmers to 
stop growing coca and produce coffee cocoa or other crops 
paz zamora told a meeting of farmers monday north of la paz the 
capital of bolivia we are not going to allow the peasants of 
bolivia to become poorer after substituting other crops for coca 
andina the peruvian government news agency quoted garcia on 
tuesday as saying peasants of the huallaga valley a major 
cocagrowing region were willing to switch crops if they were 
assured transportation for what they produced and an international 
market for it 
with those conditions in a year or two well switch over all 
the land now under coca but massive economic resources are 
needed garcia was quoted as saying 
he said peru exports about 3 billion worth of fish meal oil 
coffee silver and other products plus about 750 million to 1 
billion worth of coca and cocaine paste 
coca is enormously important to our economy the agency 
quoted him as saying 
the bolivian president paz zamora told the farmers he would 
pursue a policy of eradicating coca plantations in exchange for 
economic and social development programs 
he said barco and garcia agree with that position and he was 
confident bush also will agree 
about 1500 farmers attended the meeting monday at coroico in a 
cocaproducing area about 60 miles north of la paz 
substituting other crops for coca is the centerpiece of bolivian 
policy against drug trafficking but it has made little progress 
bolivia adopted an ambitious plan in 1988 to eradicate coca 
cultivation in seven years but as of jan 31 only 7750 acres had 
been withdrawn from coca cultivation about 5 percent of the 
officially recognized 150250 acres devoted to coca plans had 
called for the elimination of 12500 acres in 1989 alone 
part of the plan to substitute other crops for coca was the 
payment of 2000 to peasants for every hectare 25 acres of coca 
planting eliminated voluntarily peasants also demanded better 
prices for the new crops guaranteed markets and better roads and 
transportation 
on monday paz zamora said coca production allows us to keep 
our balance of payments even and for this reason we should study 
carefully the problem of substituting other crops 
in eight to 10 years when the substitution program has been 
completed farmers should have incomes at least equivalent to what 
they now make from coca he said

romanias new ruling council of 
national unity endorsed ion iliescu as interim president on tuesday 
and said it would serve as a quasiparliament 
despite its powers including the right to initiate legislation 
iliescu stressed the council is not quite a parliament 
we were never elected and should try to concentrate as much as 
possible on our main task of paving the way for elections he 
said in the future parliament of romania everyone will have the 
right of legislative initiative 
the second meeting of the 253member council was held in a 
markedly improved atmosphere over its inaugural session friday 
when opposition parties accused iliescu of packing the hall with 
rowdy supporters of his national salvation front 
we have shown constructive debate and even consensus are 
possible iliescu said after the meeting we now have chances 
to assure the continuation of life in this country until the 
elections 
radu campeanu head of the influential national liberal party 
lauded the achievement of an equilibrium albeit fragile he 
had criticized the front on monday and accused it of packing the 
council 
also tuesday military officers demonstrated to demand that the 
ministers of defense and interior resign as part of an overall 
purge of military officials who backed communist dictator nicolae 
ceausescu in decembers revolution 
the defense ministry dismissed the demands tuesday night as 
ignorant and an affront to military values 
nearly 300 uniformed officers protested silently in pouring rain 
outside government headquarters in victory square while 49 
representatives waited inside to see iliescu and present a list of 
demands 
it was the militarys first serious challenge to the government 
which consolidated power only after the army decided to back the 
popular uprising against ceausescu who was deposed and later 
executed 
iliescu was president of the 11member national salvation front 
council that ruled until the council of national unity took over 
friday on tuesday he was confirmed as president of the new council 
at one point during the debate iliescu asked is anyone 
opposed to my continuing as president 
a nearunanimous chorus of no was his answer 
elected as vice presidents were campeanu ion minzatu of the 
republican party independents cazimir ionescu and ion caramitru 
and karol kiraly representing minorities 
the council decided to hold regular biweekly meetings on fridays 
and other meetings as circumstances dictate twothirds of the 
membership constitutes a quorum decisions will be made by simple 
majority in either open or secret ballot and attendance will be 
mandatory for government members 
tuesdays council meeting was open to reporters and broadcast on 
tv 
the council elected a 21member executive bureau to coordinate 
activities 10 representatives of political parties 10 
independent council members plus iliescu 
one major point of contention within the council will likely be 
opposition demands that the elections be postponed until at least 
september 
more than 35 parties are expected to compete in romanias first 
multiparty elections since world war ii now set for may 20 
the council also set up 16 commissions to deal with specific 
issues including one to investigate abuses committed under 
ceausescus leadership and another on constitutional and human 
rights 
the transport minister late tuesday resolved merchant seamens 
complaints over pay and food that led to strikes that closed 
romanias main port of constanza on the black sea and several 
smaller ports monday and tuesday idling dozens of ships 
our conditions of working and living have made us the 
laughingstock of the world we have become the paupers of the 
sea said petricia munteanu president of the union of merchant 
seamen

a spokesman for bulgarias opposition 
alliance accused the communist party on tuesday of trying to hinder 
progress in negotiations the official bulgarian news agency bta 
reported 
georgi spassov of the union of democratic forces appearing on 
national television also repeated its demands that party cells in 
factories and other places of work be abolished before free 
elections scheduled for may the agency said 
at the weekly negotiating session monday the opposition said it 
would not continue talks with the communists until that issue was 
resolved 
the union of democratic forces has been negotiating for more 
power sharing but has refused communist appeals to join the 
government because the party still dominates parliament 
last week the agrarian party once a docile ally of the 
communists said it was abandoning its subservient role and no 
longer would participate in the government which left premier 
andrei lukanov no alternative to forming an allcommunist cabinet 
bta quoted spassov of comparing the national negotiations to a 
boat with oars on one side only thats going round and round in 
a vicious circle 
he accused the communists of torpedoing the talks by 
delaying agreement on several questions 
spassov claimed the communists were in complete isolation 
bta reported 
that appeared to be a reference to the agrarian party and 
reformists who split from the communist party and formed the 
alternative socialist party on sunday 
although neither has joined the opposition both parties 
supported the demands the alliance made at mondays talks 
communist party structures were like cancerous growths 
spassov said and should be demolished because they were a means 
for the nomenclatura bureaucracy to keep in subjection and 
exploit all working people communists included 
he repeated the threat to withdraw from the talks 
in apparent response georgi pirinski head of the communist 
delegation to the talks said in a separate television statement 
any dictatorial approach was unacceptable and served only to 
question the work of the negotiations 
one opposition demand has been for greater access to the media 
especially television and radio to carry its platforms to the 
entire country they have been allowed to start a newspaper which 
is called democracy and began publishing monday 
state television and other official media are reporting on the 
oppposition more openly but it has been a slow process 
bta reported that on tuesday the communist party daily 
rabotnichesko delo appeared for the first time without the party 
motto workers of the world unite 
stefan prodev the new reformminded editor in chief said in 
an editorial it must turn from a paper of one large party into a 
paper of the nation

four shining path rebels who were accused of producing counterfeit 
tickets to soccer matches and bullfights and selling them for money 
for the groups armed insurgency officials said the illegal 
operation went on for five years 
in the bloodiest incident in three days police said 100 shining 
path guerrillas with automatic weapons attacked the mountain 
village of sol naciente sunday night and captured and killed eight 
peasants 
the rebels also wounded nine others who tried to flee police 
said 
police said the attack probably was in response to the villages 
recent formation of a civil defense group intended to repel 
guerrilla incursions the military has organized dozens of the 
groups in isolated villages to fight the rebels but many are armed 
only with homemade shotguns lances and machetes 
witnesses to sundays attack said villagers tried to hold off 
the rebels with two shotguns then had to flee when they used up 
their ammunition 
sol naciente is 245 miles southeast of lima in a remote area of 
the andes police said some of the wounded were being hospitalized 
in ayacucho 
another report said members of a civil defense group in the 
village of andamarca 165 miles east of lima ambushed 15 
guerrillas sunday night and killed seven

labor party leader shimon peres on tuesday 
demanded a quick cabinet vote on a palestinianapproved compromise 
to launch peace talks and senior party officials said labor should 
pull out of the government if the proposal is rejected 
we will certainly act so that the cabinet will make an 
unequivocal decision regarding the makeup of the palestinian 
delegation there is no point in any delay or avoidance tactics 
the leader of the centerleft party told israel army radio 
prime minister yitzhak shamir moved to reconcile with 
hardliners in his rightwing likud bloc who want to block the 
compromise which outlines the makeup of a palestinian delegation 
to peace talks with israel in cairo 
the compromise plan has us backing 
a likud meeting broke up in confusion monday after the hawks 
tried to force a vote on specific compromise proposals while 
shamir insisted on a general show of support for his peace 
initiative calling for elections in the occupied lands 
peres who has accused shamir of endangering peace efforts 
through stalling tactics suggested that the chaos in likud 
heightened the need for a quick decision 
he did not say when he would seek a vote on the compromise plan 
or whether a likud rejection would prompt him to break up the 
laborlikud coalition 
the socalled forum of four comprised of shamir peres 
likuds foreign minister moshe arens and labors defense minister 
yitzhak rabin is scheduled to meet wednesday the next regularly 
scheduled cabinet session is on sunday 
haim ramon the chief labor parliamentarian demanded on israel 
tv that labor quit the government if the cabinet rejects the 
compromise plan 
if shamir says no and blocks this opening there is proof 
that there is no point to continue the peace process with the prime 
minister he said 
the compromise plan says the 10member palestinian delegation 
should include two arabs deported by israel from the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip and at least one resident of israeliannexed 
arab east jerusalem who also has an address in the occupied lands 
such a delegation would meet palestinian demands for diaspora 
representation while technically complying with israels 
insistence that it will only negotiate with residents of the 
occupied territories 
likud hardliners including trade minister ariel sharon and 
housing minister david levy say the compromise allows the plo to 
enter negotiations through the back door and cast doubts on 
israels sovereignty over jerusalem 
in a speech before the likud central committee on monday shamir 
ruled out participation of east jerusalem arabs but did not address 
the issue of deportees suggesting he was ready to compromise 
on tuesday likud activists including levy were trying to 
persuade sharon to withdraw his letter of resignation which he 
read at the opening of the likud meeting 
sharon said on israel radio he had no plans to retract the 
letter but left a door open to compromise he said that if he had 
not quit on principle i would prefer certainly to stay in the 
government 
by law the resignation does not take effect until 48 hours 
after the premier receives the letter 
also tuesday arab reporters said israeli border police entered 
a bethlehem high school near manger square and beat two dozen 
students with truncheons metal bars and rifle butts 
the army said a border police patrol entered the bethlehem high 
school for boys tuesday after students threw stones at them but 
that all injuries occurred when the youths escaped over a terrace 
the arab reports did not say what provoked the incident 
hospital officials in bethlehem said they treated 20 students 
and that at least five of them suffered serious head injuries 
the body of abdu salam hamoud 24 was found in a cave near the 
west bank village of beituniya where he lived and arab reports 
said he was suspected of collaborting with israeli authorities 
the army confirmed the death and said police were investigating 
hamouds death would bring to 182 the number of palestinians 
killed by fellow arabs most on suspicion of collaborating with 
israels security service 
at least 656 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers 
or civilians in the 26monthold revolt against israeli rule in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip fortythree israelis have also 
died in the violence

president jaime paz zamora said tuesday 
on the eve of his departure for the drug summit in colombia that 
greater economic development is the key to stopping coca leaf 
farming 
he also said consuming nations must do more to combat drug use 
coca reduction in exchange for development that is our 
premise paz zamora told foreign reporters we are proposing 
investments in the bolivian economy it is not just a question of 
substituting one hectare of coca for oranges or coffee but the 
development of the country because coca is an integral part of the 
economy 
now the government says cocaine brings in 500 million to 600 
million a year in illegal export earnings the countrys legal 
export earnings for 1989 were 600 million dollars 
paz zamora praised president bush because he is showing unlike 
any other us president that the cocaine problem is a global one 
bolivias president called on the establishment of an emergency 
fund to handle the problem of unemployment and poverty that would 
be created as coca plants are eradicated 
he said however that he was not going to the drug summit in 
cartagena colombia to ask for specific amounts of us aid but to 
present bolivias views 
we do not want subsidies for alternative products since that 
is a short term solution paz zamora said we rather require 
help in private and public investment and export policies that 
would strengthen our economy we have to compete with alternative 
crops 
bolivia an impoverished country of 69 million in the heart of 
south america produces an estimated onethird of the coca leaf 
that is processed into cocaine paste and cocaine 
bolivias coca leaf eradication program began to take off in 
december and january when farmers destroyed 3127 acres of coca 
plants 
farmers destroyed fewer than 7410 acres in 1989 far short of 
the 12350 goal under an agreement with the us government that 
promised aid in return for meeting the eradication quota 
the united states was supposed to cut off 12 million in 
economic aid but has decided not to because of the eradication 
efforts of the past two months the us embassy in la paz said 
at least 250000 farmers depend on coca leaf cultivation and 
cocaine production for their livelihood us embassy figures 
indicate but tens of thousands of coca leaf farmers have been 
leaving the tropical jungles in interior bolivia in recent weeks 
because the price of coca has plummeted below the cost of 
production 
the drop in coca leaf prices is attributed to the colombian drug 
crackdown and increased antidrug activities in bolivias 
drugproducing jungles 
bolivian police and us drug agents said tuesday that two major 
cocaine processing labs had been destroyed and 8800 pounds of 
cocaine paste confiscated the past several days 
the labs found the past four days were hidden in tropical 
forests in the north where most of the coca leaf is processed into 
cocaine paste and cocaine they are the biggest labs and the 
largest quantity of cocaine paste ever found in the region the 
us drug enforcement administration said 
we are now aiming at bigtime traffickers and leaving farmers 
alone said don ferrarone the dea station chief for bolivia 
he said the labs were in full operation and were capable of 
producing 1100 to 13000 pounds of cocaine base a day

the four allied powers that defeated nazi 
germany in world war ii have maintained their rights as victors 
and 45 years later still have the final say on the reunification of 
the divided nation 
the disclosure in ottawa that the united states soviet union 
britain and france had agreed to a twostage plan for reunification 
provides the international framework to close the long final 
chapter of the war 
a peace treaty has never been signed between the four powers and 
germany even though all four ended their state of war with the 
country during the 1950s 
differences between the western powers and the soviet union over 
germany led to some of the tensest episodes of the postwar era 
such as the western airlift in 194849 that broke the soviet 
attempt to isolate west berlin 
in 1961 east germany built the berlin wall which only began to 
be dismantled last year around west berlin to stop the flow of 
east germans to the west that exodus was threatening to deprive 
the communist state of some of its most skilled workers 
at the end of world war ii britain the soviet union and the 
united states agreed pending a peace settlement that some former 
german territories in the east would be taken over by poland and 
the soviet union many germans living there fled to the west 
east and west germany joined in the 35nation helsinki accords 
of 1975 that specified european borders could be changed only 
peacefully and west germany has signed separate treaties with the 
soviet union and poland that addressed the border issues 
but not all german political parties have renounced claims to 
the eastern territories and any peace agreement would be expected 
to put the issue to rest 
the zones occupied by the victors after the war became the 
modern states of east and west germany the germany democratic 
republic in the eastern soviet zone and the federal republic of 
germany in the western zones 
over the years the four powers have forsaken most of their 
occupying rights in east and west germany but a number of 
anomalies remain and the victors continue to oversee berlin 
berlin deep inside east germany is divided into four sectors 
each controlled by one of the powers the british french and us 
sectors make up west berlin and the soviet sector is east berlin 
which east germany claims as its capital 
armed forces of the four powers retain and exercise their rights 
to patrol in the other sectors the western powers refuse to 
recognize east german authority in east berlin and officially 
insist on resolving any disputes with soviet officers 
the four powers military units also have rights to patrol in 
east and west germany 
the western powers require east and west germany to run troop 
trains to ferry any of their military between west germany and 
berlin east germany must allow access through three corridors 
across its territory to berlin 
the military forces of britain france and the united states 
remain concentrated in the zones once occupied by the victors now 
allied with west germany through the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
the western powers also have maintained exclusive rights to fly 
commercial planes into berlin from the west although west germany 
has recently obtained some rights for joint flights 
reluctance of the western powers to recognize the east german 
state created under the auspices of the soviets was one of the 
obstacles to german membership in the united nations east and west 
germany didnt join the united nations until 1973

members said cambodias warring factions must withdraw to separate 
areas as a prelude to peace but talks ended tuesday without 
agreement on disarming the groups

china and britain focused their discussions on proposals to get all 
parties in the civil war to lay down their arms and sought to

more young americans today love 
humor if it is gruesome targets women or is lowkey according to 
a psychologist who studied what made college students laugh 
james carroll a psychology professor at central michigan 
university said tuesday that students 25 years ago disapproved of 
the gruesome humor that is now widely accepted 
gary larsons cartoon the far side which occasionally 
portrays animals eating humans is an example of gruesome humor so 
are helen keller jokes and dead baby jokes carroll said 
college students 25 years ago did not endorse that kind of humor 
but it seems more acceptable today 
mel helitzer a journalism professor who teaches a course in 
humor at ohio university in athens ohio said societal attitudes 
have changed more than have individual tastes 
its more of a public acceptance helitzer said humor is 
criticism and we tend to make jokes about things that bother us 
like dan quayle 
carroll administered the institute for personality and ability 
testing humor test of personality to 79 college students in fall 
1988 the original test was administered in 1963 to 200 students by 
raymond cattell at the university of illinois results of carrolls 
study were published in the december 1989 issue of psychological 
reports 
the test asks subjects to respond to 150 jokes and cartoons as 
either funny or dull he correlated the results with 12 dimensions 
of humor and compared the findings to the 1963 results of the same 
test 
what we once called blue humor or hard core is being accepted 
today said helitzer who had not reviewed the study 
carroll said his study found college students of both sexes have 
changed in their appreciation of humor for instance the 1963 
study indicated that 40 percent to 45 percent of all students 
appreciated humor directed at women that figure rose to about 70 
percent of all students in the 1988 study 
it may be that the society is more open carroll said 
his study also found that women are finding jokes about 
themselves funny and people like lowkey controlled humor like 
that of comedians david letterman and arsenio hall

the american red cross received 525 
million in donations designated for earthquake relief after the 
oct 17 quake but the group only plans to spend half that amount 
on the disaster a spokeswoman said 
mayor art agnos has criticized the disaster relielf organization 
for failing to disclose donation and spending information as well 
as its spending plans 
so far the red cross has spent 121 million according to 
spokeswoman barbara lohman who said the total emergency spending 
will reach between 13 million and 16 million 
an additional 10 million was allocated in december for 
extraordinary needs she said after elected officials and 
community leaders appealed to the red cross for additional aid 
an agnos spokesman said the figures disclosed monday confirm the 
mayors position 
this seems to confirm what weve been saying and even more 
said spokesman scott shafer that 525 million figure is just 
for those who designated earthquake relief a lot of people 
probably just donated without specifying where it was to go so even 
that figure is probably conservative 
lohman defended the spending plans 
we dont give service based on how much money has been 
raised she said we give service based on needs 
donors who earmark their checks for quake relief have no 
guarantee that the money will be spent that way she confirmed 
a committee charged with allocating the special 10 million fund 
has set a deadline for friday for accepting spending proposals from 
cities counties and private groups lohman said the group will 
begin making decisions next month she said adding that more money 
may be allocated if the needs are there 
the northern california quake on oct 17 measured 71 on the 
richter scale killing 67 people injuring about 3000 and causing 
an estimated 7 billion in damage

the four nations that defeated nazi germany in 
world war ii have maintained their rights as victors and legally 
have the final say 45 years later on the reunification of the 
divided nation 
the disclosure in ottawa that the united states the soviet 
union britain and france had agreed to a twostage plan aimed at 
reunifying germany provides the international framework to close 
the final chapter of the war 
the four principal victors the united states britain france 
and the soviet union all ended their state of war with germany 
country during the 1950s the three western powers made agreements 
with west germany the soviet union with east germany further 
agreements followed in the 1970s 
no peace treaty was ever signed and it is not clear there will 
be a formal treaty like the versailles treaty that ended world war 
i 
germany was never supposed to be divided and the allies agreed 
to administer the country as a unit but to avoid confusion zones 
of occupation were established for the country and separately for 
the capital berlin even before the allied armies entered the 
country from east and west 
despite pressure from british prime minister winston churchill 
to hold what he had the western commander gen dwight eisenhower 
insisted on adhering to the occupation zones even pulling back 
us troops that had driven much further to the east in many places 
differences arose almost before the shooting stopped the soviet 
union dismantled whole factories in its occupation zone carting 
them home over the objections of the western allies 
the introduction of a new currency in the western zones over 
soviet objections in 1948 led the soviets to stop all rail road 
and water access to berlin which lay 110 miles inside their 
occupation zone 
an airlift by the western powers that flew coal and food into 
berlin round the clock eventually led to the lifting of the 
blockade one of the most tense episodes of the cold war 
in 1961 east germany built the berlin wall that only began to 
be removed last year around west berlin to stop the flow of east 
germans to west berlin which was threatening to deprive the 
communist state of some of its besttrained people 
at the potsdam conference in july 1945 britain the soviet 
union and the united states agreed that pending a peace settlement 
some former german territories in the east would be taken over by 
poland and the soviet union many germans living there fled to the 
west 
east and west germany joined in the 35nation helsinki accords 
of 1975 that specified european borders could be changed only 
peacefully and west germany has signed separate treaties with the 
soviet union and poland that addressed the border issues 
but not all german political parties have renounced claims to 
the eastern territories and any peace agreement would be expected 
to put the issue to rest 
the zones occupied by the powers after the war became the modern 
states of east and west germany the germany democratic republic 
in the eastern soviet zone and the federal republic of germany in 
the three western zones 
over the years the four powers have forsaken most of their 
occupying rights in east and west germany but a number of 
anomalies remain and the victors continue to be the legal 
overseers of berlin 
the city is divided into four sectors each controlled by one of 
the powers the british french and us sectors make up west 
berlin and the soviet sector is east berlin which east germany 
claims as its capital 
armed forces of the four powers retain and exercise their rights 
to patrol in the other sectors the western powers refuse to 
recognize east german authority in east berlin and officially 
insist on resolving any disputes with soviet officers 
the four powers military units also have rights to patrol in 
east and west germany 
the western powers require east and west germany to run troop 
trains to ferry their military units between west germany and 
berlin east germany must allow access through three corridors 
across its territory to berlin 
the military forces of britain france and the united states 
remain concentrated in the zones once occupied by the victors now 
allied with west germany through the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
the western powers also have maintained exclusive rights to fly 
commercial planes into berlin from the west although west germany 
has recently obtained some rights for joint flights 
reluctance of the powers to recognize the state created under 
the auspices of the other side was one of the obstacles to german 
membership in the united nations east and west germany didnt join 
until 1973 
one of the last joint enterprises of the four powers was 
imprisoning rudolf hess a deputy to hitler until his mysterious 
flight to britain in 1941 they took turns guarding hess in spandau 
prison in berlin until he died in 1987 at 93

drexel burnham lamberts announcement that it 
was seeking bankruptcy court protection deepened the gloom for many 
stock market traders whose jobs already are at risk amid an 
industrywide business recession 
the atmosphere of the market is as bad as ive ever seen it 
said frederic j bostrom who has spent 22 years as a new york 
stock exchange floor trader the last five with minneapolisbased 
brokerage piper jaffray amp hopwood inc 
drexel brokers and clerks milled about on the exchange floor 
tuesday openly looking for job prospects skittishness and gallows 
humor prevailed among nearly all the traders as they elbowed past 
each other or stepped outside for cigarettes 
did you hear drexels paying debts with monopoly money a 
passing trader said to bostrom 
in a telephone interview after the close of trading bostrom 
said he had received calls from large institutional clients of 
drexel asking him if he knew of any openings for brokers there 
were none 
if one out of 10 that are unemployed by drexel burnham find a 
job thats good given the state of the business these days he 
said 
one floor specialist who asked not to be identified played 
down the effects of drexels problems on the mood of the exchange 
noting that the dow jones industrial average closed up nearly 5 
points after initially falling when drexel said it would default on 
100 million in loans 
but others said the markets performance was no indicator of the 
depth of personal fears on the trading floor 
this stuff is very very worrisome as it bears on the whole 
stock market community and the feeling that you aint seen it all 
yet said robert seijas a specialist with the firm lasker stone 
amp stern its generally an atmosphere of malaise of uncertainty 
and depression 
the securities industrys business has slowed since the october 
1987 stock market crash resulting in thousands of layoffs as firms 
attempt to cut costs 
youve got an already depressed industry with people losing 
their jobs and then you superimpose this on top of it said an 
independent trader there isnt a positive sign here right now 
further deepening the gloom were fears that drexels troubles 
would create a ripple effect among companies with business or 
pending deals with drexel 
those fears were fueled early in the day when exchange officials 
temporarily stopped the execution of trades by pforzheimer amp co a 
company that uses drexels back office to complete its trades 
later satisfied that no drexel capital was involved execution 
of pforzheimer trades was allowed to continue but a message had 
been sent that drexels troubles might also be woes for the rest of 
wall street 
its everybodys problem in the market because everybody has 
done business with drexel and is still doing so bostrom said 
i do know its got this place in a very negative mood and 
the market at this juncture doesnt need much of anything to have 
the stilts knocked out from under it

nelson mandela came home a hero 
tuesday welcomed after nearly three decades by an ecstatic throng 
of blacks who delighted in his freedom but also heard him mourn the 
oppression of apartheid 
more than 120000 people crammed into the countrys largest 
stadium to greet the man revered by most south african blacks as 
their leader many were getting their first glimpse of him 
the march toward freedom and justice is irreversible 
mandela told the roaring crowd in the township that has become one 
of the bleakest symbols of apartheid 
at what the independent south african press association called 
the largest political rally ever in southern africa mandela 
exhorted blacks to end their factional disputes take control of a 
crisisridden school system and work with discipline to end 
whiteminority rule 
whites he said must be reassured that a south africa without 
apartheid will be a better place for all 
some spectators came six hours early to get seats and the 
80000seat stadium was overflowing by the time mandela arrived 
youths perched precariously on wall tops others scaled 
120foothigh light towers and more than 30 people were injured as 
crowds shoved and pushed to get a view of the podium 
an explosion of joy shook the stadium when mandela 71 emerged 
from an underground walkway saluting with a raised fist 
mandela mandela the crowd roared as he slowly walked 
around the field flanked by top leaders of his african national 
congress and other antiapartheid groups people thrust fists into 
the air and danced as mandela passed them 
today my return to soweto fills my heart with joy mandela 
said at the same time i have returned with a deep sense of 
sadness that you are still suffering under an unjust system 
in cape town the government issued its first formal response to 
mandelas statements since his release sunday after more than 27 
years in prison 
constitutional development minister gerrit viljoen said the 
government agreed with mandela that apartheid must be eliminated 
and voting rights extended to blacks but he criticized mandelas 
support for continued guerrilla violence and economic sanctions 
the government is not prepared to accede to the handing over 
of power viljoen said if that is the goal of the armed 
struggle then there is no meaningful way ahead 
president fw de klerk who ordered mandelas unconditional 
release replied when abc newsman ted koppel asked him in an 
interview tuesday why after 27 years he decided now was the time to 
free mandela 
in south africa life sentences usually come to an end at 25 
years but there is also the political side first the officials 
ministers of the state and finally my predecessor started to talk 
to mr mandela and the commitment to peace came through also in 
the two discussions that i have had with him the commitment to 
peaceful solutions came through 
the interview was broadcast in part on abc news 
mandela speaking from a podium on the playing field said the 
thought of returning to soweto helped him endure his years in 
prison serving a life term for starting the ancs guerrilla war 
god bless africa the crowd sang in rolling cadences after 
mandela ended his speech raised his fist again and joined in the 
anthem of the antiapartheid movement 
two helicopters then descended onto the field and took him his 
family and top aides to a smaller stadium in soweto from there he 
drove in a motorcade escorted by soweto police with anc flags on 
their motorcyles to the modest fourroomed brick house he lived 
in before his arrest 
mandela waved to about 2000 people waiting outside then walked 
into his home 
in his nearly 30minute speech mandela deplored the poverty and 
suffering endured by many in soweto a sprawling township of 25 
million people that has been a home base for the antiapartheid 
movement 
our people need proper housing not ghettos like soweto he 
said our people need a living wage 
dressed in a gray suit and wearing reading glasses he echoed 
the major themes he has addressed since his release 
he said the anc would continue the armed struggle as long as 
the violence of apartheid continues he also condemned 
blackagainstblack violence saying it had weakened the fight 
against apartheid 
we must take bold steps to end the mindless violence in 
natal province he said more than 50 blacks have been killed in 
fighting there this week and more than 2500 since 1986 
he also addressed the whiterun security forces which he said 
many blacks view as instruments of repression 
i call on the police to abandon apartheid he said join 
in the march to new south africa where you also have a place 
in remarks aimed at quelling white fears he said i and the 
anc are as opposed to black domination as we are to white 
domination i must accept that our statements are not enough to 
allay the fears of the white population 
a new south africa has to eliminate hatred and suspicion 
caused by apartheid and substitute it with peace 
go back to your schools churches mines and communities and 
build on the massive energy of recent events in our country 
mandela said 
soweto schools were virtually deserted because pupils were 
taking part in the celebrations tens of thousands of adults stayed 
away from work 
i am so happy said spectator tebello pooe in broken 
english i am proud because how long have we been waiting for 
nelson mandela we are near to get what we are hoping for 
freedom 
huge columns of people blocked every street leading to the 
stadium even after the facility was full overloaded buses with 
youths perched on their roofs inched along the streets 
the crowd was orderly heeding a call from mandela to behave 
with dignity also tuesday the white rightwing conservative party 
filed treason charges with police against mandela and fellow black 
leaders walter sisulu and zeph mothopeng the proapartheid party 
claimed mandelas remarks since sunday were a call to overthrow the 
government 
citizens can file private charges that police investigate to 
determine if any action should be taken it is unlikely the 
governing national party would allow any official action 
the anc seeks a oneperson onevote system which would be 
dominated by south africas 28 million blacks de klerk seeks to 
negotiate a new constitution that would establish some political 
rights for blacks but provide the 5 million whites with some sort 
of veto over major decisions 
on feb 2 de klerk lifted a 30year ban on the anc and other 
opposition groups suspended executions and announced other reforms 
aimed at clearing the way for blackwhite negotiations

seconds before the exxon valdez went 
aground the third mate in control of the tanker testified tuesday 
that he called skipper joseph hazelwood to tell him the tanker was 
getting into serious trouble 
the message was interrupted by a crash gregory cousins 
testified at hazelwoods trial 
cousins and a helmsman robert kagan were at the wheel when the 
987foot tanker ran aground on bligh reef spilling more than 10 
million gallons of north slope crude in the nations worst oil 
spill 
cousins said he had begun to realize that kagan was not properly 
following his orders to make hard turns in the ships course 
i could tell we hadnt turned he said and after giving 
another order to kagan to turn harder counsins said he phoned the 
captain 
i told him that we were getting into serious trouble he 
recalled he asked wheres the rudder that was when we 
suffered the first shock and we were hard aground 
asked what further was said during the conversation cousins 
said there was nothing else to say there was a mutual hangup of 
the telephones 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is charged with one felony 
count of seconddegree criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges of 
reckless endangerment negligent discharge of oil and operating a 
vessel while intoxicated the maximum penalty for conviction on all 
counts is seven years three months in prison and 61000 in fines 
cousins testified tuesday that after the ship ran aground the 
tanker was still moving 
the vessel was swinging rapidly to the right i knew we 
were hard aground my fear was that we were sliding down the reef 
the aft end of the vessel was sliding into the rocks and we had 
people down in the engine room said cousins 
he said he gave an urgent order to kagan to turn hard left 
i think mr kagan didnt really understand the command he 
said he hesitated and i spun the wheel 
he said he had never worked with kagan before and had heard 
rumors the seaman had problems with steering on another voyage 
he said hazelwood had left the bridge only about 10 minutes 
before the accident leaving specific orders for rerouting the ship 
he asked if i felt comfortable with what we were going to do 
and i said yes cousins testified he said do you feel 
comfortable enough that i can go below and get rid of some 
paperwork i said i felt very comfortable 
cousins said hazelwood told him would be gone just a few 
minutes and to call him in his cabin when the ship started to 
make a turn 
cousins who was described monday as being frantic in the 
moments before the ship ran aground told of fairly smooth sailing 
until the hour before disaster struck 
in a slow painstaking delivery the third mate explained to 
jurors how tankers operate how radar works and the difference 
between magnetic and true north he told of many conversations with 
hazelwood about the course the exxon valdez would follow into 
prince william sound 
the prosecution is seeking to show that hazelwood abdicated his 
responsibility for command of the ship when he went below and left 
cousins in charge 
cousins described the night of the accident as extremely dark 
and misty he said that about an hour before the grounding he 
spotted ice on the ships radar screen it was too dark to actually 
see the ice from the deck cousins said but he reported it to 
hazelwood who decided to divert the tanker from normal shipping 
lanes to avoid the ice 
at the point where the evasive maneuver was beginning cousins 
said the shift changed and a new helmsman kagan arrived at some 
point he said the tanker was placed on automatic pilot but he did 
not know when or for how long 
hazelwood contends that he left clear orders with cousins for 
the ships direction and that if his orders had been obeyed the 
disaster never would have occurred 
cousins testified that he has been on the crew of various ships 
for as many as 26 trips through the valdez narrows into prince 
william sound but prosecutors have stressed that he did not have a 
special license to pilot a ship in that area 
kagan testified monday that cousins panicked and grabbed the 
wheel in a futile attempt to avert the jagged reef 
i started making the turn and he grabbed the wheel and helped 
make it kagan said i think he was kind of panicking then 
he was kind of excited

ronald reagans lawyers asked a judge tuesday 
to bar reporters and the public from the courtroom when the former 
president gives videotaped testimony friday in the irancontra case 
of his former national security adviser john poindexter 
irancontra prosecutors and the justice department joined 
reagans lawyers in saying that news organizations have no 
constitutional right to attend the pretrial deposition 
even if there were a constitutional interest in the press 
attendance at the deposition that interest is outweighed by the 
significant risk of disclosure of confidential information 
reagans lawyers said in a filing in us district court 
the justice department said in a court brief that a closed 
deposition was the only way to prevent inadvertent disclosure of 
sensitive information 
there is no other means to prevent the disclosure of national 
security matters unless they are edited out before the videotaped 
deposition is made public the department said 
reagans lawyers urged that the videotape and any transcripts of 
it be sealed until the videotape is played back to the jury at 
poindexters trial 
irancontra prosecutors however said the court should consider 
the news organizations alternate request for access to the edited 
videotape and censored transcripts of the deposition after it is 
completed 
the prosecutors said the protection of sensitive national 
security information is a compelling governmental interest 
sufficient to justify precluding the media from attending this 
proceeding 
twelve news organizations have asked us district court judge 
harold greene who is presiding in the poindexter case for 
admission to reagans deposition at the federal courthouse in los 
angeles 
if necessary the news organizations said greene could order 
closing of the deposition during lines of questioning that may 
elicit sensitive information 
arguing for an open deposition poindexters lawyers said 
reagans testimony presents no special problems of classified 
information that distinguish it from the testimony of several other 
key witnesses in the case 
in the unlikely event that classified information does seep out 
inadvertently the court might be able to strike the information 
from the public record and preclude publication of that 
information they argued 
the proposal by the 12 organizations defies common sense 
said reagans lawyers there is no possible way to predict which 
questions posed to the former president would elicit confidential 
or national security information 
they said such an approach would lead to disruptive 
restrictions on the sequence of questions or significant 
interruptions occasioned by repeated press entry and exit to the 
deposition 
reagans testimony is to be edited and played back at the trial 
of poindexter who last week was given permission by greene to ask 
reagan 154 questions plus followups 
irancontra prosecutors will crossexamine reagan at the same 
session 
the former president agreed last friday to submit to the 
questioning while reserving the option of invoking executive 
privilege on specific questions the justice department will send 
representatives to the testimony so that the bush administration 
may block responses that may impinge on national security 
executive privilege is the doctrine that certain deliberations 
of a president and his advisers in fulfilling their constitutional 
duties may be kept secret the supreme court has ruled that the 
need for evidence in a criminal trial may in certain circumstances 
require breaching that secrecy 
the former national security adviser faces trial march 5 on 
charges of conspiracy obstruction and making false statements in 
the irancontra scandal 
the news organizations applying to have reagans testimony given 
in public are cable news network inc capital citiesabc inc cbs 
inc national broadcasting co inc the new york times co the 
times mirror co of los angeles the washington post the 
associated press dow jones amp co inc national public radio usa

nato and warsaw pact negotiators agreed tuesday on 
the basic elements of a plan to open their skies to surveillance 
overflights 
after two days of talks the 23 members of both military blocs 
took a break from highpowered meetings on german unification and 
european troopcut treaties to issue a statement accepting the 
basic principles of open skies 
the plan first proposed in the 1950s and resurrected by 
president bush last may calls for members of both alliances to let 
surveillance aircraft fly over their territory the aim is to 
enhance trust and openness in addition to monitoring compliance 
with disarmament treaties 
the communique made no mention of a warsaw pact proposal to 
share planes surveillance equipment and information the most 
controversial element still to be worked out in the plan 
the soviet union and united states had accepted the broad 
outline of the plan before the ottawa meeting 
the open skies regime is neither an arms control nor a 
verification measure per se the communique said its 
successful implementation would encourage reciprocal openness on 
the part of participating states it would strengthen confidence 
among them reduce the risk of conflict and enhance the 
predictability of military activities 
the negotiators agreed to four points 
the north atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact will 
implement the plan on a reciprocal and equitable basis and the 
open skies regime will ensure the maximum possible openness 
and minimum restrictions for observation flights 
each country will have an annual quota of flights the quotas 
to be decided at future negotiations 
the original plan called for larger countries to allow several 
flights a month over their territory and smaller countries to have 
at least one every three months both alliances were to have 
roughly the same number of flights 
countries will use unarmed aircraft and certain types of 
surveillance equipment to be decided during negotiations 
other countries notably the nonaligned nations of europe 
will be encouraged eventually to participate in open skies 
all nato and warsaw pact foreign ministers will meet in 
budapest hungary on may 12 to sign a final agreement said 
foreign minister gyula horn of hungary 
lowerlevel officials will continue meeting for two weeks in 
ottawa to work out the remaining issues 
although nato had rejected the soviet idea of shared aircraft 
and information both sides have expressed willingness to 
compromise 
foreign ministers from most of the 16 nato and seven warsaw pact 
contries have praised the open skies plan and said any 
remaining disputes are not likely to block a final agreeement 
us secretary of state james a baker iii opened the conference 
monday by calling the plan potentially the most ambitious measure 
to build confidence that we have ever taken 
west germanys foreign minister hansdietrich genscher said 
tuesday he was convinced this openness and cooperation will 
increasingly become the natural form of relationship in europe and 
north america 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze on monday proposed 
expanding the surveillance concept to sea and space but us 
officials quickly rejected the idea and it appeared to go no 
further 
the open skies plan is not linked formally to any other 
treaty negotiations but officials hoped early agreement could ease 
verification questions in the vienna talks on cutting conventional 
forces 
most smaller countries welcome the open skies plan because 
they lack the satellite technology to conduct surveillance on their 
own 
east bloc countries all of whose hardline communist leaders 
have lost power in the past year face critical economic conditions 
and some expressed reluctance to take on the expense of overflights 
czechoslovak foreign minister jiri dienstbier said monday that 
at a time when we are embarking on the very complicated period of 
transition to a marketbased economy we could only with difficulty 
assume excessive financial commitments

from stores after the discovery of a tiny amount of contamination 
in perrier water in the united states 
mika iiyoshi an official of perrier japon kk said the 
company will voluntarily withdraw about 10000 cases from store 
shelves immediately until the japanese health and welfare ministry 
confirms the mineral waters safety

president daniel ortega said tuesday that about 
2000 contras have infiltrated nicaragua in an attempt to sabotage 
the campaign leading up to national elections feb 25 
ortega said the contras plan to contest electoral results 
since two north american opinion polls clearly indicate a 
sandinista victory 
two surveys conducted in january by the usbased pollsters 
greenberg lake and bendixen schroth gave ortegas sandinista front 
a strong lead over his major rival violeta barrios de chamorro of 
the united national opposition known as uno 
ortega said he met with roman catholic cardinal miguel obando y 
bravo to discuss his claims that 2000 contras plan to block the 
electoral process with attacks ambushes etc and create a 
climate of terror in the war zones so that people wont vote 
the allegations could not be corroborated by nongovernment 
sources 
i expressed to the cardinal my worry about the verbal and 
other kinds of violence of recent days ortega said 
obando y bravo said he told ortega we believe that the 
country can only move ahead through authentic reconciliation 
hopefully the people of nicaragua will be able to express 
themselves on feb 25 without fear he said 
the church has conducted orientation sessions on the electoral 
process 
ortega called on those who have plans to subvert the electoral 
process to renounce their plans and accept this battle on civic 
grounds 
in the poll by greenberg lake 51 percent of those surveyed 
supported ortega 24 mrs chamorro and the rest were undecided or 
backing minor candidates interviewers questioned 901 people around 
the country for the poll commissioned by hemisphere inititatives 
a bostonbased group that has been invited to observe the elections 
the bendixen schroth poll commissioned by the spanishlanguage 
network univision in the united states gave ortega 53 percent of 
the vote mrs chamorro 35 percent and said the rest either were 
undecided or supported minor candidates 
neither of the pollsters disclosed the method of interviewing or 
the margin of error in the surveys 
the contras began fighting the government with us backing in 
1981 claiming the sandinistas had betrayed the goals of the 1979 
revolution that toppled the family dynasty of anastasio somoza 
many contras have given up the struggle and returned to civilian 
life in nicaragua but others remain hostile to the sandinistas 
some contras still live in camps along the honduran border the 
united states has stopped arming them but congress is expected to 
discuss continuing nonlethal aid which runs out at the end of the 
month 
the bush administration has indicated it wants the contra force 
to remain in existence until after the elections as pressure for 
free and fair balloting

a new study linking natural body rhythms 
to fat and cholesterol has raised the possibility that patients 
could lose weight without special exercise or diet researchers 
said tuesday 
all you need to do is take a pill but you have to do it at 
the right time of day for the individual said albert meier 
professor of zoology at louisiana state university who initiated 
the research 
the results of the study were announced by lsu which has 
patented the procedure and licensed it to a boston diabetes clinic 
for further clinical tests and application for us food and drug 
administration approval 
the procedure in which small amounts of the drug bromocryptine 
were given at specific times was tested on 70 patients by baton 
rouge physician c william lovell and the results are being 
prepared for scientific publication the university said 
the first 33 patients in the study lost 25 percent or more of 
their fat within six weeks although they were allowed to eat 
anything and did no special exercise 
meier said people dont get fat because they eat too much or are 
lazy but because their body produces fat in a rhythmic kind of 
biology similar to that experienced by animals during migration or 
hibernation 
he said the discovery grew out of 25 years of research that 
started with whitethroated sparrows which build up body fat 
before their long migrations without eating any extra food or 
cutting down their activity 
meier who has published extensive research on birds and fish 
said he expanded his focus to include mammals when he saw the 
possibilities for humans 
other researchers in obesity called the concept interesting and 
said it would be the first bridge between human weight loss and 
studies of fat in hibernation and migration 
i hope hes right said elliot danforth jr director of the 
clinical research center at the university of vermont we need a 
breakthrough in this area 
however he said he could not assess the study without seeing 
how the researchers monitored what people ate or didnt eat 
since the nausea from bromocryptine could possibly reduce appetite 
and he said it would be tricky finding the exact time of day in 
which the pill would work 
the proof will be in the clinical effect said dr george 
bray an authority on obesity who directs the pennington biomedical 
research center in baton rouge but applying the medication in 
rhythmic doses may be enough to make it work bray said 
meier said the bromocryptine works by inhibiting secretion of 
the hormone prolactin prolactin is linked to the bodys use of 
insulin which scientists have known for years has caused fat 
production he said 
prolactins major function is to maintain receptors in the 
liver that respond to insulin the higher the level of prolactin at 
a specific time of day the more abundant the receptors and 
consequently the greater the fat production by the liver he said 
inhibiting prolactin cuts down on the number of receptors and 
thus the amount of fat produced 
bromocryptine is already fdaapproved and in weight loss is used 
in tiny doses as small as onehundredth of the normal dosage 
meier said actual weight loss per person averaged about 5 
percent 
only fat was removed no water proteins or carbohydrates 
he said 
lovell said he took the drug and lost 11 pounds in six weeks 
the only side effect was some nausea he said 
meier and lsu adjunct professor anthony cincotta now associated 
with wellman laboratory part of massachusetts general hospital and 
harvard medical school in boston reported the results of their 
study with animals in december in the journal life sciences 
in the article they said that within 10 to 15 days body fat 
was reduced 15 to 50 percent and cholesterol 15 to 40 percent in 
several animal models including pigs 
lsu has signed an agreement with ergo inc a biotechnology 
company in newport ri to market the research

the united states and the soviet union agreed 
tuesday on a sharp reduction in troop deployments in central europe 
to 195000 for each superpower canadian external affairs minister 
joseph clark announced 
the united states could keep up to 30000 troops elsewhere in 
europe under the agreement clark said 
the accord worked out during an open skies conference 
represents soviet acceptance of the initiative president bush 
unveiled in his state of the union address jan 31 
clark made the announcement in a conference hall with secretary 
of state james a baker iii soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze and other foreign ministers looking on baker and 
shevardnadze did not speak 
the united states now has about 305000 troops in europe of 
which about 275000 are on the central front mostly west germany 
and 30000 generally in navy and air force units in greece 
turkey italy spain and britain 
the soviet union has about 565000 in east germany poland 
hungary and czechoslovakia four nations that have shed their 
hardline communist governments 
poland hungary and czechoslovakia are negotiating troop 
reductions with the soviet union 
announcing the settlement clark said it overcomes one of the 
most difficult obstacles to a treaty nato and the warsaw pact 
have been negotiating since the 1970s in vienna on limits to 
conventional forces in europe 
other key limits in the projected treaty would cover tanks and 
other nonnuclear weapons 
however only monday baker stressed in a speech to the 
conference that the united states and the soviet union were in 
disagreement on limits for combat aircraft without such agreement 
a treaty would be more difficult to reach 
the agreement on troop ceilings the first of its kind was one 
of three at the natowarsaw pact conference capping an 
extraordinary nine days of diplomacy that saw baker confer with 
allies and others in ireland czechoslovakia the soviet union 
romania bulgaria and finally in ottawa 
the second agreement establishes a twostage process aimed at 
german reunification in which the two germanies confer followed by 
talks of their foreign ministers and those of the four powers that 
defeated nazi germany in world war ii the united states britain 
france and the soviet union 
in the third agreement nato and the warsaw pact agreed in 
principle on open skies surveillance methods by which 
reconnaissance aircraft of one side will fly over the territory of 
the other details are to be worked out for a may 12 signing 
ceremony in budapest 
during bakers talks in moscow last week soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev proposed a somewhat different troop 
arrangement equal levels for the united states and the soviet 
union on european soil of either 195000 or 225000 each with no 
subceiling for central europe 
baker took that proposal to the foreign ministers of the 15 us 
allies in nato who were assembled in ottawa for a twoweek 
conference with the seven members of the warsaw pact on aerial 
surveillance as a means of allaying suspicions of surprise attack 
shevardnadze said the accord was close to gorbachevs proposals 
referring to bushs initiative shevardnadze told reporters he 
did not say he would not agree to that 
the foreign minister with a twinkle quipped are you 
disappointed 
in washington the white house said in a statement the 
president is pleased that this agreement on manpower removes the 
major obstacle to an early conclusion of a cfe conventional forces 
in europe treaty 
the accord on troop limitations capped a series of breakthroughs 
during bakers nine days in europe and canada 
in moscow he and soviet officials broke the back of several key 
issues that stood in the way of a treaty to reduce longrange 
missiles bombers and submarines by 30 to 50 percent 
sealaunched cruises missiles were separated from the emerging 
treaty that bush and gorbachev intend to sign at their summit 
meeting in washington in june 
also an agreement was worked out for destruction of chemical 
weapons stock also to be signed in june provided other nations 
capable of producing gas agree to an international treaty

the united tates and its major european allies 
forged agreement with the soviet union and east germany tuesday on 
a twostage formula to reunite germany 45 years after the world war 
ii victors divided it 
the nations foreign ministers released a terse statement on the 
agreement and us officials added detail 
in the first stage east germany and west germany would meet on 
legal economic and political issues according to the statement 
the talks would begin soon after east germany holds its march 18 
national elections 
in the second stage the foreign ministers of the two germanys 
would meet with the foreign ministers of the united states france 
britain and the soviet union to discuss external aspects of the 
establishment of german unity including the issues of security of 
the neighboring states 
the statement hammered out at an eastwest open skies 
conference added that preliminary discussions at the official 
level will begin shortly 
although the statement was not specific among the external 
aspects to be considered by the big four allies of world war ii 
who defeated nazi germany and its allies in the most devastating 
war in history will be whether the new germany is a member of the 
main western military alliance the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
president bush telephoned chancellor helmut kohl of west germany 
during the day to discuss final details of the agreement according 
to a white house statement tuesday night 
the news came late in the evening in germany too late for most 
citizens to react immediately the west german television network 
broadcast a live report from its correspondent in ottawa shortly 
after 11 pm german time 
ard pointed out that the way seemed clear for most of the 
points but that the foreign ministers had set to one side 
temporarily the tricky question of the military posture of a united 
germany 
in east berlin the official news agency adn distributed the 
news at 1043 pm in a brief report that noted the discussions 
will also include the questions of security of neighboring states 
the agreement on german unification was one of three at the 
natowarsaw pact conference capping an extraordinary eight days of 
diplomacy that saw us secretary of state james a baker iii 
confer with allies and others in ireland czechoslovakia the 
soviet union romania bulgaria and finally in ottawa 
in the second agreement announced by canadian external affairs 
minister joe clark the united states and the soviet union agreed 
on troop ceilings of 195000 for each superpower in central europe 
and an additional 30000 for the united states elsewhere in europe 
in the third agreement nato and the warsaw pact agreed in 
principle on open skies surveillance methods by which 
reconnaissance aircraft of one side will fly over the territory of 
the other details are to be worked out for a may 12 signing 
ceremony in budapest 
the united states wants a united germany to remain in the nato 
alliance while the soviet union wants a neutral germany east 
germany now is a member of the warsaw pact 
us officials bill the plan as two plus four a reference 
to the four world war ii allies and the two germanys 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze met earlier tuesday 
with his west german counterpart hansdietrich genscher and with 
baker 
genscher on tuesday affirmed that east and west germany would 
reunite and sought to reassure the world that the new country would 
not pose any threat to peace 
we tell all our neighbors what we want to unite the federal 
republic of germany the german democratic republic and the whole 
of berlin no less and no more we do not have territorial claims 
against any of our neighbors 
we seek a european germany not a german europe he said 
genscher made the comments to open the second day of a 23nation 
open skies conference the main topic of which has been 
eclipsed by the german unity issue 
in bonn kohl and communist premier hans modrow met to discuss 
monetary union they agreed to set up a commission to study ways of 
making the west german mark the official currency of east germany 
three forces had been at work in the world powers discussion 
a conviction moscow grew to share with washington that 
unification was inevitable 
a western desire to keep germany in nato 
anxiety among people who suffered at germanys hands in world 
war ii 
bush administration policymakers were operating on an assumption 
those concerns could be allayed and any aggressive german 
tendencies diverted by keeping germany within the 16member nato 
but state department officials speaking on condition their 
names not be used stressed that no outside power would have the 
right to interfere in the germans sovereign decisions 
work toward the german reunification plan had been under way 
quietly for several weeks though the subject was not the stated 
reason for a number of meetings baker had with world leaders in and 
out of washington 
baker talked about the matter separately with british foreign 
secretary douglas hurd and genscher separately in washington with 
french foreign minister roland dumas during a refueling stop en 
route to czechoslovakia and finally with soviet leaders when he 
reached moscow last week 
west germanys kohl and genscher flew to moscow last saturday to 
lobby for unification with east germany

prime minister margaret thatcher who is seeking a 
bigpower conference with both germanys prior to reunification 
said tuesday night that some european developments may stir 
deeply felt anxieties 
britain on tuesday joined in an agreement in ottawa on a 
twostage formula to reunite the two states after 45 years of 
division 
the united states the soviet union britain and france allies 
in world war ii and the two germanys agreed that talks between 
east germany and west germany would begin soon after east germans 
march 18 elections the six foreign ministers would meet later to 
discuss security considerations 
speaking at a dinner in honor of visiting polish premier tadeusz 
mazowiecki mrs thatcher said both poland and britain have had 
experiences this century which we are determined should not 
happen again an evident reference to nazi germany and world war 
ii 
that is why we believe it is so important to work out very 
carefully the implications of germanys unification for existing 
alliances for the helsinki accords and for the european 
community 
we understand and support your view that the present border of 
poland should be guaranteed she told mazowiecki polands first 
noncommunist prime minister since the war 
west germany has promised to respect polands border with east 
germany saying it will not try to reclaim polish territory 
inhabited by ethnic germans 
mrs thatcher said she accepted the germans right to 
determine their own future in freedom 
but it is vital that germanys unification should uphold not 
weaken europes stability and security that is why these matters 
must be very carefully worked out in full consultation with 
germanys allies and neighbors 
in his reply mazowiecki also referred anxiously to german 
unification how will the germans settle the problem of their 
constitutional unity to which as any other nation they are 
unquestionably entitled he asked 
thatcher aides speaking on condition of anonymity had said 
earlier she wants any formulas that emerge from talks to be 
presented to an eastwest summit meeting of the 35nation 
conference on security and cooperation in europe due this year 
mrs thatcher is to discuss the proposal in london wednesday 
with west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
mrs thatchers plan is seen as a response to critics who accuse 
her of seeking to slow the momentum toward reunification she has 
not disguised her concern that hasty moves could undermine european 
security 
jacques delors president of the european community executive 
commission suggested tuesday that the 12nation bloc hold a 
special summit on german unification after the east german 
elections 
no german peace treaty was signed after world war ii although 
the united states britain and france renounced their status as 
occupiers in 1955 they retain authority in berlin and maintain 
armies in west germany

the impact of drexel burnham lambert incs 
stunning decline reaches like an octopus beyond wall street and 
junk bonds potentially threatening many businesses that depend on 
financial markets to raise money 
the drexel bankruptcy filing could inject more sellers into the 
already depressed junk bond market which the firm dominates 
creating a confidence crisis that might spread into stocks 
highergrade corporate debt and other securities investment 
experts and business executives said tuesday 
such turmoil would affect the broader economy possibly by 
pushing interest rates and the dollar higher in opposition to 
government attempts to sustain economic growth 
drexel said its parent company was filing tuesday night for 
federal bankruptcy court protection from creditors due to problems 
stemming from the deterioration of the junk market and the impact 
on its financial holdings 
many expressed surprise at the frightening speed with which 
drexel formerly one of the most powerful investment banks hurtled 
toward collapse because of the junk bond market it was largely 
responsible for creating 
it took a long time to string together this enterprise and 
not much time at all for it to crack up said james grant author 
of a prominent financial newsletter that frequently has warned 
against the perils of junkbond debt 
others likened drexels demise to a disaster that will further 
erode the tarnished credibility of the depressed securities 
industry overall and persuade investors to shun investments that 
have no relation to junk bonds 
this could force companies that historically have relied on 
selling stocks and bonds for new capital to curtail spending plans 
lay off workers or even seek bankruptcy protection themselves 
does three mile island ring a bell with you said paul e 
berg president of berg fiduciary consultants an investment 
advisory firm in port chester ny 
when we had the explosion and problems at three mile island 
it impacted the entire utilities industry berg said referring 
to the 1979 nuclear accident youve got pretty much the same 
situation here 
drexel vaulted to prominence in the 1980s by aggressively 
peddling highinterest securities with low credit ratings as a way 
to raise money for businesses seeking to expand the securities 
became known as junk bonds because of their relatively higher risk 
of default compared with investmentgrade corporate bonds 
even before drexels latest problems a number of prominent 
deals that depended on junkbond financing had begun unraveling or 
faced serious obstacles drexel played a role in many of them 
on tuesday for example drexel client integrated resources 
inc a diversified financial services company that has been 
struggling for months sought federal bankruptcy protection 
earlier this month federal regulators seized floridas biggest 
thrift centrust bank blaming its failure partly on risky 
investments in drexel junk bonds centrust is one of integrateds 
leading creditors 
banks insurers pension funds mutual funds and other investors 
who bought junk bonds because they promised such high rates of 
interest could wind up owning nearly worthless pieces of paper 
some financial strategists said 
now the reality is beginning to sink in its coming home to 
roost that when people originally called them junk bonds thats 
exactly what they were said jack barbanel managing director of 
first global asset management an investment company in princeton 
nj 
others emphasized however that the overall number of junk 
bonds held by most investors remains only a tiny percentage of 
their portfolios the total value of assets held by pension funds 
for example is more than 25 trillion while the entire junk bond 
market once amounted to about 200 billion 
if everybody owned a piece of a junk bond it would be pretty 
small said william overgard director of investment consulting 
at buck pension fund services in new york 
drexels destiny changed dramatically after the 1987 stock 
market crash and its involvement in the ivan boesky insider trading 
scandal for which the company paid record penalties and agreed to 
unprecedented government scrutiny 
drexel has since shrunken to half its former size forced to 
sell some operations because of the agreement with the government 
still drexel has remained the preeminent marketer of junk bonds 
which have plunged in price during recent months because of rising 
concern that the debts wont be repaid 
throughout its rise and fall drexel has enjoyed strong client 
loyalty because of what supporters call the companys culture of 
hard work and dedicationmany expressed sorrow at the companys 
latest crisis 
i think the whole thing is a terrible tragedy said bernard 
salick chairman and chief executive officer of salick healthcare 
inc a chain of outpatient health care centers that drexel helped 
finance its going to have reverberations through so many 
industries like one after the other

an adviser to mikhail s gorbachev 
acknowledged on tuesday that some east european nations may 
eventually may leave the warsaw pact the soviet military alliance 
marshal sergei akhromeyev former soviet chief of staff was 
asked in an interview whether he thought one or two of the seven 
warsaw pact members might withdraw and replied probably he 
would not say which ones 
hungary and czechoslovakia are negotiating for removal of soviet 
military forces from their territory akhromeyev said the kremlin 
was willing to discuss troop withdrawals with poland but had not 
received a formal request 
he also repeated the soviet position expressed by the soviet 
president last week that the maximum number of us and soviet 
soldiers allowed in europe must be identical in an agreement to 
reduce conventional forces 
president bush had said monday the gorbachev proposal was 
unacceptable 
but on tuesday the united states and the soviet union agreed in 
ottawa on a deep cut in troop deployments in central europe to 
195000 each with the united states allowed to keep up to 30000 
troops elsewhere in europe canadian external affairs minister 
joseph clark announced 
the agreement worked out during an open skies conference 
represents soviet acceptance of an initiative bush unveiled on jan 
31 
an estimated 565000 red army soldiers are stationed in europe 
outside soviet territory the united states has 305000 most of 
them in west germany 
nato and the warsaw pact also agreed in principle in ottawa on 
tuesday on open skies surveillance methods by which 
reconnaissance aircraft of one side will fly over the territory of 
the other details are to be worked out for a may 12 signing 
ceremony in budapest 
speaking through an interpreter akhromeyev said he thought most 
nations will continue to stick to their organizations united by 
some common nature of interests so i believe the warsaw pact will 
continue to exist 
if one or two states would pull out of the warsaw treaty part 
of the military contingents will withdraw from the combined armed 
forces akhromeyev said this is going to be for those states 
to decide 
the statement once unthinkable reflect the great changes in 
the soviet bloc where virtually all nations have renounced the 
communist partys dominant role in society and have embraced 
democratic changes 
akhromeyev is on the defense committee of the soviet legislature 
and is in brussels for meetings sponsored by the north atlantic 
assembly which consists of legislators from the 16 nations of the 
north atlantic treaty organization 
some of the soviet legislators are to confer on wednesday with 
manfred woerner a west german who is secretarygeneral of the 
western alliance 
akhromeyev said he thought negotiators for nato and the warsaw 
pact could complete an agreement in vienna this year on reducing 
the number of tanks artillery and other nonnuclear arms in europe 
the toughest issue he said was a formula for combat aircraft 
negotiators will have to undertake really great efforts in order 
to find a solution to this problem but leaving it out of the 
accord was out of the question akhromeyev said 
a sticking point has been soviet insistence on excluding 
thousands of defensive aircraft the west wants included in the 
count 
akhromeyev said the timing for withdrawal of soldiers from 
hungary and czechoslovakia would be fixed in the talks but i 
dont believe it is going to be a lengthy process 
as for poland he said once a request for negotiations was 
received we are going to engage in the talks and have our forces 
removed from there 
he said the 380000 soldiers stationed in east germany were 
there because of agreements reached after world war ii 
the legal basis for stationing our forces there is the same as 
the legal basis for the american troops british troops and french 
troops in west germany akhromeyev said 
he would not discuss what security arrangements the soviets 
would want for a unified german state but said moscow would not 
say anything against the reunification process or oppose efforts 
to have a reunited germany a neutral nation 
west germany is part of nato and east germany belongs to the 
warsaw pact western officials insist a united germany remain in 
nato 
another agreement at ottawa tuesday establishes a twostage 
process aimed at german reunification in which the two germanys 
confer followed by talks of their foreign ministers and those of 
the four powers that defeated nazi germany in world war ii the 
united states britain france and the soviet union

george bush is no stranger to danger in 
colombia eight years ago as vice president he escaped an 
apparent assassination plot in which a load of dynamite was buried 
under the lone runway at the bogota international airport 
the explosives were found hours after bushs plane took off 
only then did security officials discover the dynamite connected to 
wires running to an electrical generator 300 yards away 
the 1982 incident provides a sharp reminder of the risks bush 
faces as he prepares to fly to colombia on thursday for a sixhour 
drug summit with the presidents of colombia peru and bolivia 
colombian authorities say about 5000 security agents will be 
deployed when the leaders meet at a heavily guarded naval base near 
the coastal resort of cartagena

drexel burnham which became a wall street 
powerhouse through its pioneering use of highrisk junk bonds to 
help finance the 1980s takeover boom is looking for outside help 
because of its deteriorating holdings 
drexel burnham lambert incs announcement monday that it is 
seeking a major investor or merger partner followed three days of 
talks with federal regulators who worried that a collapse of the 
firm would shake confidence in the nations financial markets the 
new york times reported today 
securities industry analysts and former drexel executives echoed 
those concerns they said its difficulties with the declining 
junkbond market it helped create and its 1989 guilty plea to 
federal securities fraud could deter potential investors 
at this point i think the biggest problem is the loss of 
confidence in them said chris mahoney analyst with moodys

under pressure from the auto and petroleum 
industries the bush administration is backing away from a proposal 
that would require millions of alternative fuel cars to be sold in 
cities most plagued by smog 
the phasing in of cars powered by fuels such as methanol or 
natural gas was a centerpiece of president bushs clean air 
proposal last summer the white house envisioned use of up to 1 
million such vehicles annually by 1997 in an attempt to reconcile 
the automobile to the environment 
but william reilly head of the environmental protection agency 
acknowledged monday that the administration no longer considers 
mandatory production of alternative fuel cars as an essential part 
of clean air legislation 
instead the administration is proposing in negotiations with 
senate leaders that reformulated gasoline which also cuts 
pollution would be welcomed as an alternative to the alternative 
fuel vehicles

nancy a character in thirtysomething the 
abc chronicle of the lives of ordinary people of a certain age is 
encountering one of lifes biggest crises nancy has cancer 
she had found her own empowerment as a successful illustrator of 
childrens books and had reconciled with her selfabsorbed husband 
elliot they were contemplating having another child so she went 
for a physical examination 
the physical prompted a high suspicion that something might be 
abnormal said dr maurie markman a medical oncologist 
specializing in ovarian cancer at the memorial sloankettering 
cancer center here 
he is a frequent watcher of abcs series which airs on tuesday 
nights tonights episode an abc spokesman says continues the 
story of nancy and the problems another character melissa is 
having with her father and her lover 
in earlier episodes that led to nancys far greater problem 
doctors initially did a laparascopy a small incision in the 
abdominal cavity markman said they found the abnormal cells 
that indicated ovarian cancer she then underwent removal of her 
uterus ovaries and fallopian tubes 
nancy was lucky markman said because ovarian cancer has no 
specific early symptons examination wont help in this disease 
at all he said 
even though the disease was discovered at any early stage nancy 
still faces a grueling regimen of chemotherapy she certainly 
needs chemotherapy and i think theyre going to give it to her 
markman said 
its usually between five and eight to 10 months of treatment 
with fairly standard drugs associated with a fair amount of acute 
side effects markman said 
he said the severity of those side effects ary from patient but 
they include nausea vomiting fatigue loss of appetite hair 
loss potential risk of infection bleeding anemia and sometimes 
more serious problems like kidney damage and neurological damage 
including numbness and tingling of the feet 
seventy to 80 percent of ovarian cancer patients are cured with 
therapy he said in the more advanced cases probably only 20 to 
30 percent survive and in very advanced cases probably 10 percent 
survive 
most of the time you survive markman said she doesnt 
appreciate that at this point what shes focusing on is that she 
has got a 20 to 30 percent chance of dying and i think thats very 
accurate thats not television 
elliot played by tim busfield also is creating a truetolife 
if not particularly likeable character hes sort of dealing 
with this by being incredibly busy and almost not willing to hear 
what shes saying markman said 
thats exactly how i would expect a loved one to respond with 
time and with thinking about it with discussions you will find 
out what your loved one needs not by ignoring the complaints and 
then being reassuring he said 
marshall herskovitz executive producer and cocreator with 
edward zwick of thirtysomething said the shows writers have 
consulted with cancer specialists about the disease 
he said nancy has stage ic ovarian cancer and the sideeffects 
of her chemotherapy arent expected to involve hair loss or extreme 
nausea which is not to say that there arent side effects he 
added that is the reality 
it was always our intention to illustrate what weve seen to 
be the truth of life with cancer which is that life goes on 
herskovitz said 
nancy is not defined by the fact that she has cancer now and 
thats something weve not seen on television and that seems so 
much the heart of life with cancer he said 
chemotherapy will become a factor in her life a nuisance a 
burden in her life but it will not define her life he said 
markman is impressed with the shows handling of the cancer 
theme as well as actress patricia wettigs portrayal of nancy 
this is not a soap opera the doctor said the character 
herself is very good and i think she wettig has done a very good 
job of portraying the real feelings shes focused on her death 
what markman wants to emphasize is that there is real hope nancy 
will be cured of her cancer and live a normal life for many years 
right now she cant think about that he said im just 
hopeful that that aspect of the life of a cancer patient does not 
get lost in the story line

while the economic fraternity was looking for 
economic clues from retail sales during the christmas season the 
manufacturing economy was eroding right under their noses 
productivity was falling layoffs growing profits falling 
inventories accumulating labor costs rising and production 
declining in some respects the situation was the worst since the 
last recession 
none of this was new however all these indicators were 
weakening throughout the year the rate of profit growth for 
example fell in every quarter of 1989 and it probably will fall 
again in this quarter 
understandably such a situation has instilled fear in 
manufacturers and they have expressed it by production slowdowns 
campaigns to reduce inventories and a reevaluation of plans to 
expand factories 
how could all these signs have drawn so little attention 
because say some analysts consumers are the key and everyone was 
watching them they account for 66 percent of gross national 
product they have kept the expansion going 
the consumer they said is our leader 
that might have been so observed economists at dri mcgrawhill 
a statistics unit of standard amp poors corp but now the 
consumer has become a follower not a leader of the economy 
in short manufacturing slowed down to wait for the consumer and 
the consumer slowed down to see what manufacturers were up to the 
economy stalled out 
economic silence breeds fear somehow interest rates began 
rising even though everyone but alan greenspan chairman of the 
federal reserve board seemed to believe they should be going the 
other way 
as you might expect the weather didnt cooperate december was 
one of the coldest on record in much of the northern united states 
and even deep into the south utility and food bills rose producer 
prices jumped sharply 
recession talk grew more ominous and there was a good basis for 
it if prices are rising and production is slowing you have a 
recipe for no growth and no growth is just a statistical fraction 
from shrinkage 
unfortunately the fear of inflation is feeding the fear of 
recession the dri mcgrawhill analysts pointed out and now 
nobody seems to believe in the future strongly enough to get things 
moving again 
the engine has stalled and producers and consumers stand by 
wondering what to do somebody has to get in the vehicle and steer 
but somebody has to push who will do what 
not i say the consumers we havent the strength to push and 
frankly we dont think its fair for us to have to steer the 
engine weve had our splurge we have kept the economy moving for 
years and now we need a rest 
moreover we have piled up too many bills everyone tells us 
that and we believe them and now were going to save instead 
interest rates are rising so it will pay to have money in savings 
producers however view their big inventories and rebel against 
being in the drivers seat and they add they arent strong 
enough to push profits of late are real poor they say they might 
even have to cut capital spending

dawn can be horrible if youve fallen asleep 
with the tv on youre apt to wake up hearing odd chants and 
sayings that chill the soul 
you will hear things like this and its one and two and three 
and four 
or four three two and hold it 
or this workouts gonna be an outerbody experience 
all that is from espns bodies in motion one of nine 
exercise shows for adults available on cable and overtheair tv 
here from 525 am when morning stretch begins to noon when 
espn emits bodyshaping there is also a 630 am show for 
tykes called mousercise 
most of the grownup shows are in the early morning which is 
when everyone should be thinking of calling in sick they feature 
something called lowimpact aerobics a form of exercise in which 
hearty men in tights and lovely women in leotards stomp in place 
wave their arms and smile smile smile 
it is not good to see all this at dawn but you can watch 
exercise tapes those of jane fonda are the bestknown at a 
decent hour a decent hour is 3 pm on a saturday when you just 
cant back get to sleep 
what goes in these tapes always had been a mystery to us but we 
recently received one called fitness now by judi sheppard 
missett founder of a 20yearold exercise business in los angeles 
called jazzercise 
missett previously made two other tapes and in 1982 had the 
first exercise album to sell more than 500000 copies according to 
a note with the tape 
moving right along now her new tape starts with an explanation 
of a perceived exertion method it uses a chart divided into 
three parts yellow green and red 
red means you may be about to go blooie and should slow down 
yellow is for warmup says missett with the green zone for 
aerobic time when in the green she says to maximize your 
fatburning potential youll need to exercise between fairly 
light to somewhat hard and hard 
she introduces six fellow instructors all as healthylooking as 
she and the main event begins 
we normally dont exercise lest we croak but we have a go at 
following follow missetts instructions which include exhortations 
to keep your body lined up and how to warm up the feet for 
fatburning dancing 
the tempo of the softrock music increases arms are waved amid 
her cries of encouragement to wit yeah and again hah and 
again 
then individual parts of the body get a workout including the 
head which is to be rolled around that is the easy part we start 
fading when she moves us into the green zone part of the tape 
so put on your dancing shoes tap your toes were going 
to burn some fat and were going to have fun right guys her 
colleagues say yes but as the tempo goes to a brisk disco beat we 
say no 
we hop up and down we hear a wild scream it is max the cat on 
whom we accidentally have hopped max flees we bend about rock 
back and forth do a pelvic tilt raise and lower the old 
knees roll the old arms around 
what are we burning gang cries missett 
fat her colleagues shout 
we get down and boogie we find it very hard to get back up 
after only three minutes of brisk hopping bending and waving we 
hear sounds of things breaking a hamstring an achilles tendon a 
truss all of it ours 
this means we are in the red zone we sit down then we lie 
down and realize there is a large untapped market out there it is 
for a tape that shows you how to lie down and stay there

for all thats happening in eastern europe the 
communist party remains in firm control in vietnam but a visit to 
the capital city of hanoi reveals that even here capitalism has 
obtained a toehold some stringent controls have been loosened and 
westerners are no longer looked on as ogres 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a pedicab works its way through hanois 
treelined streets dodging a jumble of motor scooters and 
bicycles delivering a japanese color tv to its new owner 
it rolls past a park dominated by a bronze statue of karl marx 
then under a large poster depicting a heroic laborer peasant 
soldier and scientist fighting to build socialism 
but elsewhere along the pedicabs route there are indications 
that fledgling capitalism is taking hold in this communist capital 
of southeast asia 
there are the dozens of privately run cafes decorated with 
colorful lights where people gather at night to chat or watch 
television over a drink that may be a 1 can of heineken beer or a 
50cent bottle of vietnamesebrand lua moi vodka 
there are shops stocked with imported tape decks and 
videocassette recorders to be snatched up by the citys nouveau 
riche 
by all accounts the vietnamese capital has become a more 
relaxed place to live as the government introduces dramatic 
marketstyle economic reforms and eases stringent political 
controls 
westerners who live in hanoi or frequently visit the city say 
they are amazed at how fast the changes have occurred they note 
the vietnamese are even becoming more colorful in their dress with 
reds and pinks replacing the drab clothing of a few years ago 
everywhere one turns western influences are clearly mingling 
with the traditional and socialist 
at a recent hanoi wedding reception for example a pop combo 
complete with sax was on stage playing an overly audible version of 
cat stevens wild world as traditional cookies and tea were 
served to about 200 guests including elderly communist officials 
staterun television also reflects the western influence 
on a recent early evening program the camera lovingly panned 
along a counter of carefully arranged lean cuts of meat the type 
of propaganda programming long found in poor marxist states but 
just a few hours later the people of hanoi tuned in to a flashy 
whitney houston music video 
socialist author nguyen dinh thi insists the party also is 
giving the countrys intellectuals more freedom he said writers 
now have the right to speak the truth even though private 
newspapers and magazines still are not allowed in this oneparty 
state 
and while a foreigner can now visit a hanoi friend without 
causing a panic over possible repercussions such visits are best 
made at night under the cover of darkness so as not to attract too 
much attention 
but for all the changes the party still rejects any challenge 
to its monopoly on power and the economy still has a long way to 
go as vietnam remains one of the worlds poorest nations 
beggars accost foreigners on hanois streets and inside 
department stores while families live in cramped apartments 
housing up to a dozen or more people 
on virtually every hanoi street dozens of young men play 
billiards on roughly hewn pool tables a sign of the serious 
unemployment 
meanwhile the colonialera infrastructure of hanoi continues to 
crumble from neglect after escaping largely unscathed from the war 
with the united states 
power outages are common and the buildings need not only a fresh 
coat of paint but substantial renovation work 
among the structures still standing is the infamous hanoi 
hilton a prison that once housed american prisoners of war but 
is now officials say home to only common criminals 
public transportation is limited with only a few buses and 
wheezing trolleys of ancient vintage on the potholed roads the 
major mode of transportation remains the bicycle 
in the countryside the rice paddies that line the main road to 
the northern port of haiphong are irrigated by hand bridges over 
major rivers are only one lane wide but handle twoway vehicle and 
rail traffic 
on a recent weekday morning scores of cars and trucks waited 
for nearly an hour as two steam locomotives belching black smoke 
laboriously chugged across one bridge 
vietnam is counting on the west to help in its modernization 
efforts particularly now that eastern europe and the soviet union 
are preoccupied with fixing their own sputtering economies 
fifteen years after the end of the vietnam war the united 
states still refuses to establish diplomatic ties with hanoi and is 
blocking vietnamese efforts to obtain assistance from international 
financial organizations 
despite the us bombing of the north during the war and the 
continued political snubs from washington the people of hanoi 
appear to hold few grudges against americans 
that spirit was exemplified by nguyen thi quy a 66yearold 
woman who lives near kham thien a hanoi street devastated by a 
1972 us bombing raid 
quy lost her 14yearold daughter in the attack every day she 
lights incense at a memorial to the victims that was erected on the 
site of a kindergarten destroyed in the bombing 
the openair memorial consists of a concrete statue of a woman 
with a dead child resting on her knee it bears the inscription 
deeply bear in mind hatred for the us aggressors 26121972 
two small bunches of flowers flank the entrance 
quy her long hair streaked gray and black began to cry when 
she recounted the loss of her daughter whom she said was making 
plans to travel abroad to study when the bombs fell 
how does she feel about americans 
i hate that american plane that killed my daughter she 
says but i dont hate the american people

it was an allamerican city of the 1950s a

cops in hiding on newburghs east end 
watch three men selling crack cocaine make a couple of quick deals 
theres no business like drug business sings out one of the 
dealers to the tune of the irving berlin show biz anthem 
the cops move in and bust all three 
thats newburgh 1990 a city of 25000 on the hudson river just 
50 miles north of new york city but with a worse reputation in 
relation to its size 
the newburgh of donald presuttis youth was so safe so 
prosperous so clean that in 1952 look magazine called it the 
allamerican city 
the newburgh of donald presuttis adulthood the one he 
administers as mayor is an urban battleground where citizens are 
trying to reclaim their streets from the drug pushers and addicts 
and criminals whove made the city a dirty word in the northeast 
the fight for freedom on the american soil is being fought in 
newburgh and on the streets of cities like newburgh presutti 
says if we lose this war society as we know it today will no 
longer exist what youll end up with is possibly what old rome was 
like with all the villas and cities walled and armed guards 
everywhere 
presutti doesnt think he is overstating the danger and neither 
do other city and civic leaders what has happened to their city is 
happening all over america just not to such an extraordinary 
degree they say 
our commitment to the war on drugs is so great that we have 
unarmed john q citizens out on the street trying to intimidate 
drug users and drug dealers presutti says this is the first 
war other than the revolution and the civil war thats being fought 
on the street 
just over 9000 crimes were reported to police in newburgh in 
1988 the last full year for which statistics are available the 
citys crime rate of 1395 per 1000 in population was more than 
double the statewide average and a total approaching those of 
cities atop the fbis national highcrime list 
for a community in new york state however the crime index 
thats always mattered most is how a city compares with new york 
city 
newburgh has a higher murder rate than new york city and a 
higher rate of rapes and burglaries and robberies and aggravated 
assaults and larcenies according to data from the new york state 
division of criminal justice services 
a special anticrime unit formed within the newburgh police 
department in 1985 was supposed to deal with burglary robbery and 
prostitution cases now 90 percent of its work concerns 
drugrelated crime the task force makes eight to 10 felony drug 
arrests each week 
people old enough to remember agree that newburghs slide began 
in the 1960s when manufacturing companies began to scale back 
local operations in the face of foreign competition and aging 
factories newburgh was once the biggest maker of pocketbooks in 
the nation once a thriving fabrics and garment center once a busy 
bottler of beverages and maker of furniture 
the bottom fell out in the 1970s 
i would say that newburgh in a lot of ways epitomized the 
problems that the entire northeast experienced says chris 
dunleavy executive director of the orange county chamber of 
commerce the manufacturing base moved off to the south and 
offshore many workers who had moved in from the south from puerto 
rico and latin america people who were basically unskilled 
remained 
the citys medium household income is 10923 far less than the 
18012 average for orange county as a whole unemployment in the 
city runs at about 8 percent compared to the statewide average of 
about 5 percent 
newburghs location on the hudson river was once an ideal place 
for a manufacturing center to distribute its goods later the city 
benefited from being at the intersection of two major interstate 
highways the northsouth new york state thruway and the eastwest 
interstate 84 
now police say the city has become a crossroads for drug 
traffic between new york city upstate new york and new england 
authorities say local dealers have ties to cocaine distribution 
networks based as far away as miami 
many dealers have set up business in newburgh to escape the 
cutthroat drug trade in new york city police say the drug buyers 
range from newburghs own poor to affluent businessmen and college 
students 
buyers also come from as far away as albany new jersey and 
pennsylvania according to newburgh police capt santo centamore 
state social services commissioner cesar perales said after a 
recent tour of newburgh that the most blighted parts of the city 
are comparable to the notorious south bronx in new york city 
a citizens group called the newburgh drug and alcohol task 
force has tried for a year to mount a grassroots campaign against 
drugs 
the group has staged rallies on lander street and other 
notorious drug haunts where members marched with signs and chanted 
antidrug slogans in demonstrations they dubbed one block at a 
time it has organized rallies in local schools and lobbied with 
state officials for special antidrug aid 
among the most visibile antidrug activists are joan shapiro a 
former mayor of newburgh and her husband jerry while in office 
during the mid1980s she regularly cruised the streets at night in 
search of her son a cocaine addict who eventually was sent to a 
drug treatment center and has been clean and serene for more 
than three years 
in late september gov mario cuomo declared that newburgh would 
be the only area outside new york city to be included in an 
experimental state program to fight drugs through a combination of 
steppedup enforcement better treatment programs and improved 
education 
as cuomo was announcing newburghs designation at a local 
school a woman was arrested on nearby lander street for crack 
possession 
she was wearing a stop crack button

its still popular and growing she said in an interview at 
her studio at wfaefm just before leaving for a working vacation 
at her parents home in greenock scotland if it werent i 
might graciously bow out 
thats the last thing her fans many of whom write her letters 
and subscribe to her newsletter want ritchie to do 
thistle amp shamrock is the reason god invented ears wrote 
one fan from laramie wyo 
i work as a ranger deep in the woods of northern maine for 
half the year and every saturday night at 8 pm finds me glued to 
the radio for the thistle amp shamrock wrote another fan your 
show has opened a whole new world of music and musical instruments 
to me 
ritchie launched the celtic music show in 1981 as a local radio 
show in charlotte where she had spent a year in college as an 
exchange student from stirling university in scotland two years 
later apr syndicated it nationally 
the name of the show came out of her imagination 
its my own concoction says ritchie her face breaking into 
a big smile i wanted a name that would evoke a place where this 
music would be performed a publike setting 
theres a style she brings to her weekly show thats all fiona 
ritchie 
one week the theme could be songs of the sea the next songs 
about the working class later music from a particular region of 
ireland or england could be featured ritchie gives her listeners a 
brief preview before each set 
the appeal of the show lies directly with fiona says apr 
spokeswoman deborah wolfer in a telephone interview from st paul 
minn her personality is engaging and her fans sense her 
enthusiasm for the subject people listen for her not just the 
music 
to ritchie the real attraction is the music some of it 
hundreds of years old while she started off as an amateur her 
small office is now crammed with tapes celtic records and music 
reference books 
im always looking for new music she says ill be 
bringing some recordings and cds back with me from scotland but i 
even find some of it here in charlotte 
ritchies playlist ranges from the traditional scottish ballads 
of jean redpath including the songs of robert burns to the 
irish traditional music of de danann and of course the chieftains 
in ireland 
another ritchie favorite is the battlefield band which plays 
music based on traditional scottish tunes 
dougie maclean who toured with ritchie last year also is a 
popular attraction hes a scottish songwriter who writes new music 
in traditional arrangements 
you also could hear the contemporary offerings of nightnoise 
including cuts from something of time and at the end of the 
evening 
when i first moved here i had no idea there was such a 
connection between the area and scotland ritchie says i 
didnt expect the people to take such an interest in the music 
to ritchie the musics appeal transcends most of lifes 
differences including age national origin and economic class 
people enjoy music thats emotional she says this music 
is loaded with emotions 
her fans come from all ethnic backgrounds not just those with 
an irish or scottish heritage this music has something 
everyone can enjoy 
her own tastes run from traditional celtic music to jazz and 
classical and on to contemporary artists like u2 van morrison and 
nancy griffith 
ritchie can be spotted at concerts across the country taping 
live shows for later play on the thistle amp shamrock 
last march ritchie took the thistle amp shamrock on the road 
six scottish musicians headed by fiddler dougie maclean played 
sellout concerts in 10 us cities the second annual tour will 
begin in september

actress valerie harper who plays a city 
manager in her new cbs comedy series knows how to fight city hall 
after she was fired in august 1987 from nbcs valerie since 
retitled the hogan family she took the producers lorimar 
studios and the network to court she not only fought she won 
getting a settlement of 14 million for lost wages her husband 
and the coexecutive producer tony cacciotti also received a 
substantial settlement 
in the series city harper plays city manager liz gianni 
who copes with hectic conditions at work and with a nubile teenage 
daughter demanding more freedom at home 
harper probably best remembered as the irrepressible rhoda 
morgenstern of the mary tyler moore show and rhoda also 
will be seen tuesday in the cbs movie stolen one husband she 
stars as a wife who loses her husband of 25 years played by 
elliott gould and sets out to get him back 
while still in court over valerie harper became actively 
involved in developing city in january jeff sagansky the new 
president of cbs entertainment and former subordinate of nbcs 
brandon tartikoff pulled the faltering the famous teddy z and 
rushed city into its monday time slot 
that puts city directly opposite the hogan family in 
the ratings for the premiere episode harper knocked the socks off 
her former family which in a sense is biting the hand that feeds 
her the court awarded her a profit participation in her old show 
that could yield 15 million 
i dont think placing it against my former show was 
deliberate she says it was deliberate to put me in that 
monday comedy block i think jeff sagansky was looking for 
something fresh and singular and honest to replace teddy z but 
going against the hogan family was happenstance 
i certainly didnt want to go against the cosby show on 
thursday at 8 oclock i didnt want to go headtohead against 
roseanne roseanne barr sent me two dozen roses the day after i 
started work were both at the mtm studios 
wed met at the comedy awards show when i was still in 
court she said someone had told her not to get pushy to remember 
the lesson of valerie harper she said to me i hope you teach 
them a lesson 
harper believes her court victory has indeed sent a clear 
message to hollywood it showed she says that she had not walked 
off the show in a display of temper or behaved erratically as 
lorimar had alleged but had been wrongfully discharged 
after valerie harper was first involved in a show called 
desperate women the comedy created by paul haggis was about 
a family of italian women in brooklyn 
cbs said we liked the show before but we dont like it now 
says harper i dont know what they didnt like about it 
probably that i was in a domestic situation the way i was in 
valerie i had a deal with cbs for a show and we started over 
again there was no way i was going to go ahead without paul 
haggis i wasnt sure hed want to start over again from scratch 
tony knew that paul had a treatment for an hour show called 
city that was like la law tony suggested making it a 
halfhour paul said it was too heavy but he came back after a 
weekend and said ok the original show was intended for a woman 
the city in city is never identified its a large city 
about the size of cleveland or pittsburgh and is in the snow belt 
a broken sign in the show that says city of expresses 
conditions and attitudes at city hall that liz is trying to correct 
harpers character is italian she calls herself italian by 
association 
my stepmother angela is n italian from new york city she 
says i based rhoda on her and a jewish friend named penny ann 
green people often said that rhoda seemed to be italian that was 
the angela seeping through 
liz is a person who has to handle a budget and deliver what 
the politicians promise she has to see that the police and fire 
departments run and that the garbage is collected she has a 
passion that sometimes gets her into trouble her daughter penny 
is the apple of her eye but their temperaments are entirely 
different theres a lot of give and take between us 
harper says she sees no resemblance between liz and rhoda liz 
is a woman with a lot of ability who knows how to get things done 
she sees liz as closer to the role she played in farrell for the 
people a 1982 movie pilot in which she played a prosecuting 
attorney

when youre an aspiring musical comedy performer 
and cant get jobs because you look as if youre 12 but sing like 
alfred drake where do you go 
the precarious world of cabaret offers opportunity if not 
steady employment the latter might be a possibility now for jeff 
harnar a 30yearold babyfaced baritone who has gathered rave 
reviews since the debut last july of carried away his show 
celebrating the lyrics of betty comden and adolph green 
new york critics tossed superlatives comparing him to cabaret 
performerturnedsuperstar michael feinstein they called harnars 
innovative evening of songs done at two different nightspots 
around town one of the best of the year 
the object of their admiration is an unassuming young man who 
has struggled for more than a decade to make a name for himself in 
music it has been an effort 
harnar arrived in new york in 1979 from various points west he 
grew up in a lot of cities where his father worked for ford motor 
co it was in dearborn mich at age 5 that harnar discovered 
musicals a neighbor was doing a community theater production of 
how to succeed in business without really trying and took him 
to see it 
the whole thing the music seeing someone i knew on stage 
the sets the costumes and knowing even at that age that the show 
had a part in it i would like to do just came together harnar 
says he was hooked on theater 
harnar nurtured that ambition in high school in winnetka ill 
at a school where musicals he says were treated with respect 
when he finally got to new york in 1979 it was a different 
story musicals werent the same brash broadway musical comedy had 
given way to big british spectacle 
i was typed as a juvenile in auditions he says and then 
id sing with a baritone voice most of the roles were for tenors 
juvenile tenors i was never cast and i took that very much to 
heart 
in 1983 as his last hurrah in show biz harnar put together an 
act for a onenight run at a small club out of it came a twoweek 
booking 
but i had such a miserable time that i figured thats it i 
dont know what im going to do with this career he recalls 
what he did was put it on hold he went to work as a houseboy 
for phyllis mcguire of the mcguire sisters for three years he 
didnt sing or go to the theater i was very depressed he says 
but the job proved to be an opportunity to observe his employer 
in a similar situation 
she was launching a comeback and i was watching her go 
through the exact same things that i was going through as a 
newcomer the scope of it was a lot grander but she had to prove 
herself again to get back in the door in las vegas it inspired me 
probably even more than i realized 
it was through the course of that job that i realized that 
its not so much the talent there comes a point where your talent 
is the given its more happenstance the opportunities the 
persistence the perseverance 
by 1987 harnar was ready to try again he eventually found a 
home at eightyeights a greenwich village nightclub he was able 
to change and hone his act there finding out what was viable in 
front of an audience to support himself between engagements he 
took a job as a singing waiter at a west side restaurant 
the evening of comden and green songs was born last april but 
the songwriting team responsible for the lyrics for such shows as 
on the town bells are ringing wonderful town do re 
mi and others was not easy to persuade at first 
harnar his pianist alex rybeck and his director sara louise 
lazarus researched material from all the comden and green stage 
and film musicals but when the singer called them to get approval 
he found the team wanting to discourage the project 
harnar kept talking turning the tide when he told them he was 
thinking of singing never never land from peter pan as a 
doowop number that got a laugh out of green as well as the teams 
ok 
the title of the show carried away a song from on the 
town also is its theme in it harnar sings comden and green 
patter songs as examples of getting excessive about life and love 
for his next cabaret effort harnar and friends plan to salute a 
theatrical year he picked 1959 because thats the year he was born 
and because hes hooked on the 50s theres plenty of material 
among the shows that opened on broadway in 1959 were gypsy 
the sound of music fiorello take me along 
redhead and destry rides again as well as such interesting 
flops as juno and saratoga the list of composers includes 
richard rodgers jule styne jerry bock marc blitzstein harold 
rome and harold arlen 
when you put together a club act its entirely your favorite 
songs its exactly what i want to be singing when that gets 
received well thats the most rewarding experience i can 
imagine he says 
now my peers come up to me and say when are you going to get 
over this cabaret thing and get back to pounding the boards 
auditioning i am auditioning when auditions come along that im 
right for i go to them but the fact of the matter is im so 
happy doing what im doing

small but potentially significant moves 
toward more representative government are touching much of the arab 
world where monarchs emirs presidents or ruling parties have 
long held overwhelming power 
the overall balance has hardly shifted toward popular rule 
however parliamentary democracy as it is known in the west with 
government answerable to an elected legislature has never taken 
firm root in the arab world despite a number of experiments 
while some nations now are experimenting with secular 
parliaments and national assemblies it is possible that new 
regimes in some countries could ultimately be shaped as much by 
islamic traditions as by western democratic principles and 
developments in eastern europe where centralized political and 
economic systems are being painfully rebuilt could also have their 
effect 
liberalizations have been touching individual arab nations for 
at least a year with rulers in many cases being careful to 
strictly limit the new openings 
some arab commentators however say leaders need to move faster 
with concessions to popular representation before increasingly 
educated citizens disgruntled by economic problems and strict 
political control launch revolutions of their own the fall of 
eastern europes dictators like romanias nicolae ceausescu 
touched off additional comment in the arab world 
theres an arab saying when your neighbor shaves you should 
wet your beard publisher ahmed jarallah wrote in kuwaits 
alseyassah daily 
after what happened in romania many should prepare their 
beards for shaving as the people will not forgive them there are 
regimes in the middle east which destroyed their peoples and their 
economic resources 
but while there are comparisons between some arab nations and 
eastern europe powerful elites pervasive security networks and 
burgeoning economic problems there also are significant 
differences 
the arab drive toward reform predating the upheaval in eastern 
europe stemmed in large part from the spread of islamic 
fundamentalism that is anathema to all arab governments 
the demand for political systems based on islamic principles has 
considerable support particularly in countries like egypt jordan 
and tunisia arab leaders have largely tolerated this but have 
sought to defuse it with limited reforms 
some analysts believe the most dramatic changes could occur in 
two of the most repressive regimes in the arab world syria and 
iraq which are ruled by minority elites 
both have been heavily dependent on the soviets and reforms in 
eastern europe will many believe force them to change their 
policies 
one nation to experiment with substantial liberalization has 
been jordan bloody price riots last april highlighted widespread 
popular frustration and prodded king hussein into restoring 
parliament and overseeing the first elections since 1967 they were 
among the freest in the region in years 
husseins government also announced it would lift martial law 
free political prisoners legalize political parties denationalize 
the press and fight corruption 
yet as in other countries the reforms do not go all the way 
toward putting power in the peoples hands hussein still can 
invoke emergency powers and dissolve parliament other arab 
leaders such as egyptian president hosni mubarak and iraqi 
president saddam hussein also retain sweeping powers and are not 
elected by popular vote 
in prosperous kuwait citizens are demanding the restoration of 
parliament which was dissolved in 1986 at the height of the 
iraniraq war after deputies harshly criticized authorities 
kuwaits ruling family has announced it is considering lifting 
censorship and introducing unspecified democratic changes but the 
emir has refused to receive a petition signed by 25000 citizens 
demanding the convening of parliament 
salem almarzouk a former member of parliament who is agitating 
for its return said that since it was dissolved corruption and 
economic abuses in the emirate have been rampant 
one cannot say that parliament could solve the problems but 
it could raise the issue and pressure the government to do 
something about it he said 
in algeria once a bastion of autocratic third world radicalism 
president chadli bendjedid has allowed the creation of poplitical 
parties freed the press and introduced private enterprise 
corporations 
following riots that left 176 people dead by official count he 
brought in a new constitution for more democracy to assure 
public and individual liberties and establish the sovereignty of 
law 
local elections are due this spring with the ruling national 
liberation front competing as one of many parties 
in neighboring tunisia president zine el abidine ben ali 
promised to bring true democracy to his north african country 
when he ousted aging habib bourguiba in 1987 but in the first 
elections held in april last year the ruling democratic 
constitutional rally won all 141 seats in the national assembly 
leading the opposition to cry foul 
south yemen is opening the doors to a multiparty system easing 
travel restrictions and improving its relations with western 
countries 
the leadership there is a coalition of the ruling yemeni 
socialist party and various tribal factions reflecting the uneasy 
duality of western and traditional concepts found in many arab 
countries 
as the arab worlds only avowedly marxist state and a close ally 
of moscow south yemen has felt the repercussions of soviet 
perestroika more acutely than other countries in the region 
elsewhere sultan qaboos of the persian gulf nation of oman 
reportedly is considering reforms that include elected local 
councils in line with the traditions of the ruling ibadi sect 
which has highly developed principles of elected leadership and 
representative government 
saudi arabias ruling family has considered setting up a 
consultative council and even built an ornate building to house it 
but it has shelved the project amid conservative opposition in the 
theocratic kingdom 
there are few signs of any democratic opening in syria 
dominated by president hafez assad who seized power in 1970 and 
his pervasive military apparatus but there are no signs of 
upheaval either despite severe economic problems 
nor is there sign of sweeping change in neighboring iraq ruled 
by strongman saddam hussein despite experiments such as allowing 
elections and waging periodic anticorruption drives 
saddam recently announced that a new constitution to be 
approved by referendum would provide for a free press and the 
formation of new political parties but no details were given

selling travel documents and smuggling aliens 
have become gold mines in asia with government officials and 
middlemen making fortunes creating new identities for thousands of 
people 
paying up to 30000 apiece thousands of asians are leaving 
their continent and hoping for a better life most want to go to 
north america some enter a life of crime along the way 
alien smuggling is the crime of the 90s said mark d 
riordan a hong kongbased special agent of the us immigration 
and naturalization service its almost as lucrative as drugs but 
the penalties and dangers are minimal 
the latest rage involves a complex paper trail where legitimate 
travel agents in hong kong pay large fees for real passports and 
visas and then sell them to their clients but its also done 
traditionally by faking visas and smuggling travellers across 
borders at night 
diplomats and travel agents say officials from latin american 
countries have sold thousands of genuine travel documents to 
chinese fleeing the communist regime bolivia recently removed 
several chinabased diplomats after allegations of trading travel 
documents for sex and money in december the consul general for 
panama in hong kong submitted his resignation after allegations 
that his consulate sold up to 7000 visas to chinese 
on the traditional end counterfeit rings are pumping out 
thousands of bogus travel documents to people from thailand 
malaya pakistan the philippines taiwan and hong kong 
currently the biggest market for travel documents is china 
where businessmen and the children of important officials are 
fleeing the increasingly hardline state another is hong kong 
which comes under communist chinese sovereignty in 1997 
a 1989 us immigration and naturalization service report 
identified an elaborate and intricate smuggling pipeline used 
by people from china hong kong and taiwan to get into the united 
states 
this illegal traffic is noticeably on the increase it said 
most of the travellers want to go to north america businessmen 
and immigration officials say but immigrating there legally is 
difficult without a relative in the united states most people 
have little chance of becoming americans canada has strict 
residency requirements 
one way people leave asia is to first obtain latin american 
travel documents and then head to south america by way of the 
united states or canada entering north america under a category 
called transit without visa 
arriving in north america the immigrants attempt to sneak out 
of airports failing that they continue to latin america where 
they try to enter north america from the south 
prices for a genuine visa or passport from latin america range 
between 6000 and 30000 us businessmen say the large fees 
often mean people borrow huge sums of money from crime syndicates 
in exchange for years of service diplomats say 
in new york city chinese criminal organizations have been 
paying an average of 30000 for men from fujian province in 
southern china to be smuggled into the united states as 
indentured servants in the gangs the ins report said 
they have to commit crimes to pay back their sponsor said 
one western law enforcement source the more violent the crime 
the more money its worth 
law enforcement agents say there is little they can do to stop 
the trade first time smugglers in the united states and canada are 
rarely jailed and profits appear immense 
a chinese woman cheng chuipeng who faces alien smuggling 
charges in buffalo ny made tens of millions of dollars in the 
trade the ins alleges 
hong kong travel agent john choi estimates the industry has made 
roughly 140 million in the past year moving people out of china 
the chinese are desperate said jean chong another travel 
agent who claims he has sold scores of genuine ecuadorian passports 
to chinese nationals all they want to do is leave 
to get chinese out of china businessmen in hong kong say they 
buy visas and passports from argentina bolivia ecuador paraguay 
and thailand panama which once topped the list for document 
sales saw its popularity plummet after the us invasion in 
december 
as the chinese government does not routinely issue passports to 
its people the travel agents often buy those from corrupt police 
or local officials the going price is about 2500 
diplomats from latin american countries generally deny that 
their countries sell travel documents 
carlos pimentel the consul general of brazil in hong kong said 
brazilian officials in asia do not sell travel documents he said 
any such documents were forgeries 
a spokesman for the argentine embassy in beijing said he was 
fairly sure that every visa granted by the embassy was legal 
but western diplomats who have seen examples from several latin 
american countries said many of the documents appear genuine 
one country bolivia has acknowledged the sales 
bolivian diplomats were improperly issuing thousands of visas in 
china until the middle of last year said oscar siles bolivias 
new consul general in hong kong some were being exchanged for sex 
and others for money diplomats said the illegal practice was 
halted after several diplomats were fired siles said 
businessmen claim the biggest single outlet for visas for 
chinese nationals was the panamanian consulate in hong kong which 
according to hong kong immigration records obtained by the 
associated press issued about 7000 last year 
the consulate was run by ciro noriega the cousin of deposed 
panamanian leader manuel a noriega but he has submitted his 
resignation a panamanian trade official martin palacios said 
that any illegal activity occurred in panama and not in hong kong 
south korea has been a recent popular destination for chinese 
and other asians even though beijing has no official relations 
with the south korean government hong kong immigration records 
show that more than 700 chinese a month for the past six months 
have passed through hong kong to seoul south koreas capital 
many chinese and other asians stay in seoul only long enough to 
change flights travel agents in the field say in the airports 
transit lounge the travellers meet couriers who supply them with 
plane tickets and new travel documents they say 
bogus documents are generally less expensive than genuine but 
immigration authorities worry that that may change as 
counterfeiting techniques improve 
the hong kong government recently cracked a counterfeiting ring 
for visas to the us trust territory of saipan along with us 
green cards 
immigration officials say many of the counterfeit passports are 
produced by forgers in the philippines taiwan also possesses an 
active industry 
said one agent about the quality of recently seized fakes if 
this is the type of stuff theyre coming up with were sunk

for almost half a century being prepared for 
world war iii has been the militarys mission and a piston driving 
the american economy 
moscow and washington east and west stood toetotoe along the 
iron curtain it took a million soldiers 12000 strategic nuclear 
warheads and a growing defense budget to keep the peace in europe 
inside a year the world changed 
for eons weve been saying the russians are coming the 
russians are coming says rep ronald dellums dcalif well 
they havent come and they arent coming defense secretary 
richard cheney told congress we are now on the verge of winning 
one of the greatest victories in the history of the world without a 
shot ever being fired 
three arms treaties are being negotiated for the signatures of 
presidents bush and mikhail s gorbachev once they are settled 
reducing the stockpiles of chemical weapons conventional forces in 
europe and longrange nuclear missiles the american military will 
be transformed in size and purpose 
yet with the outbreak of peace as gov richard celeste of ohio 
notes there can be a dark side 
peace is not a completely comforting prospect for everyone 
not for the 1600 people who work in st louis at the army 
troop support command distributor of uniforms tents and other 
military supplies the pentagon wants to close it 
not for the 101000 who work for general dynamics corp maker 
of tanks submarines jets and missiles in plants from florida to 
california 
the no 2 defense contractor has become a symbol of the 
endofthecold war malady public relations executive chris 
schildz discourages reporters seeking interviews on how the company 
is going to handle it 
not for thousands upon thousands of gis who now must confront 
something that american soldiers dont usually worry about job 
security 
todays troops arent draftees like those let go after world war 
ii or the korean war or vietnam they are volunteers many chose 
the service as a career demobilization for them is as rude a 
slap as a layoff for a factory worker 
we are very well aware of the fact that this is the first time 
the united states of america has ever taken apart an army made up 
of all volunteers says lt gen gordon r sullivan the armys 
deputy chief of staff for operations and plans he says its too 
early to estimate how many soldiers will be let go 
not for the 13000 people in and around lima ohio who owe 
their jobs to the army tank plant it makes the m1 abrams tank a 
60ton monster deemed too muscular for the lighter more mobile 
army the pentagon envisions for the 1990s the plant is scheduled 
to close in 1993 
don downhour a lima resident who doesnt work at the plant 
says hes sympathetic to the plight of the tank builders but he 
sees another side we dont need tanks if were going to have 
peace he muses and thats what weve been praying for 
harry obrien shop steward at the saco defense plant in saco 
maine whose mainstay is the mk19 grenade launcher says his 
coworkers are worried by the defense cutbacks everybody is 
saying gee what happens if we get closed down he says 
the diminishing of the 45yearold threat of global war between 
the two superpowers is worrisome in other places too 
in president bushs white house no sooner had bush submitted 
his budget to congress calling for a slight drop in pentagon 
spending next year than he took to the road to sell americans on a 
single idea cutting back too fast too far is dangerous folly 
at the pentagon where cheney has been carrying the bush 
message to capitol hill he is a man in the middle knowing 
reductions will be forced by congress but needing to protect 
bushs cautious approach and the strategic concerns of the armed 
forces 
in congress where claimants for the peace dividend those 
who want to retire some national debt or cut social security 
taxes or address the problems of the homeless and illhoused 
hungry and poor or repair decaying bridges roads and sewage 
systems or fix americas education system or ease the 
medicalcost burden of the elderly are lining up for a piece of 
the pie a pie that bush says doesnt exist 
and again in congress where some foresee severe economic 
upheavals if defense plants and bases close suddenly and thousands 
of workers are left in the cold 
the trouble then is figuring out just how much defense to 
drop and where 
if the cold war is over what is the justification for spending 
25 cents of every federal dollar on defense half of which goes to 
deterring a soviet invasion of europe now deemed less likely than a 
blue moon 
from the fall of the berlin wall in november to the soviet 
communist partys historic decision feb 7 to give up its power 
monopoly events in the east bloc have eroded the very 
underpinnings of western strategic thinking indeed the east 
european states no longer are a bloc in the traditional sense 
in this new world order what will the united states do with its 
military might fight terrorists play policeman in third world 
hot spots revert to the isolationism so dreaded by us allies in 
europe and asia 
one answer may be in joining the bush administrations war on 
drugs and the president is pressing for more money to use marines 
and other military resources to help keep drugs out of the country 
for years the pentagon fought the idea arguing it would sap 
readiness to fight conventional wars and involve soldiers in police 
work customarily a civilian concern those misgivings seem to have 
diminished 
the exact features of the military transformation are not yet 
clear but some signs are visible us troop strength is being 
cut bases closed weapon programs illed and security threats 
reassessed 
less clear is what these changes will mean for individual 
soldiers and their families for communities and companies that 
depend on a thriving militaryindustrial complex and for a nato 
alliance facing possible disintegration 
bush says he hopes attrition will reduce the ranks of the 
military so that relatively few soldiers will have to be discharged 
i would like to think that a kid that went in to make a career 
out of this would not be unceremoniously dumped from the armed 
services he told reporters recently 
as pentagon planners redefine the militarys mission 
politicians are rushing to reset the nations spending priorities 
they see a new hope for social programs that took second place to 
the 1980s military buildup 
sen edward kennedy dmass has proposed carving out a 169 
billion peace dividend over the next five years more than 
quadruple the savings proposed by bush in the same period rep 
richard gephardt dmo accuses bush of beating plowshares into 
swords

the focus on defense savings also has opened an opportunity for 
supporters of conversion legislation intended to ease the 
economys transition from military to civilian endeavors 
a bill sponsored by rep ted weiss dny would require 
defense contractors to set aside 125 percent of revenues to pay 
for economic adjustment laidoff workers might get 90 percent of 
their wages while being retrained to make civilian products 
maybe its about time to redirect some of that money that has 
been used for national security to the security of people who live 
in cities across our country boston mayor raymond flynn said 
recently 
the bush administration cautions against hopes for a peace 
payout it says big savings on defense should not come until new 
arms controls deals are struck the prodemocracy movements in 
eastern europe take firmer root and more doubts are erased about 
the future of gorbachev 
cheney told the senate armed services committee on feb 1 that 
hasty moves to disarm could jeopardize a peaceful conclusion to the 
cold war he also cautioned that while gorbachev has shown a will 
to reduce soviet conventional forces in europe moscow is 
modernizing its nuclear missiles capable of reaching us soil 
in his proposed 1991 budget presented to congress jan 29 bush 
set pentagon spending at 292 billion for the fiscal year that 
starts oct 1 thats a nominal increase from the 287 billion to 
be spent in the current budget year but is a 2 percent decline 
after the effect of inflation 
bush foresees similar cuts in each of the next several years 
but critics say the pace is far too slow in light of the 
extraordinary political turnabout in eastern europe where the 
warsaw pact has fractured and at least two pact members hungary 
and czechoslovakia are demanding soviet troop withdrawals 
william kaufmann a defense analyst at the brookings institution 
think tank and a frequent consultant to the pentagon says the 
defense budget could be halved over the next nine years without 
risk to national security 
others counsel more caution 
we shouldnt be so euphoric about the prospects for peace 
says james blackwell a defense specialist at the center for 
strategic and international studies of the soviet threat he says 
its different but its not gone 
much of the heat on bushs defense spending priorities comes 
from critics who say the president is putting money in the wrong 
places for example his budget proposal seeks more than 18 billion 
for weapons targeting warsaw pact forces according to congress 
bipartisan arms control and foreign policy caucus that is an 
increase of more than 1 billion from the current budget 
we shouldnt pour billions into new weapons systems designed 
to counter warsaw pact forces that no longer exist said rep 
howard l berman dcalif chairman of the caucus 
the percentage of americans who want defense cuts is growing 
although its still a minority a new york timescbs news poll 
conducted in midjanuary said 36 percent of those surveyed favored 
a decrease in military spending 48 percent said it should stay the 
same and 13 percent said it should be raised a year earlier 24 
percent said it should be cut 58 percent wanted it the same and 13 
percent wanted an increase 
of bushs bigticket weapons projects the chief candidates 
for congressional slashing are the strategic defense initiative or 
star wars project to develop a spacebased shield against 
ballistic missiles and two new longrange missiles the mobile mx 
and the smaller midgetman 
bush requested an increase of 900 million to 48 billion for 
star wars research in the 1991 budget congress last year cut 1 
billion from the program which many see as a fat target for 
reductions given the low risk of a soviet nuclear attack 
the administration says a growing number of smaller nations are 
acquiring ballistic missiles even while the superpowers are 
negotiating big cuts in their arsenals so they say star wars 
could be used to knock down a missile fired from iran or another 
hostile nation 
the president also faces a tough fight in congress over his 
request for billions of dollars to begin modernizing and in some 
cases expanding the network of production plants and 
laboratories that make us nuclear weapons 
some lawmakers say theyll oppose bushs plan to spend up to 
600 million to extend the life of the rocky flats plutonium 
processing plant near denver that cost 225 million to build but 
has never worked properly the plan runs against the grain of a 
democratled move in congress to seek a superpower ban on 
production of nuclear arms materials 
we are not exactly living at the height of the cold war what 
is the rush to build a new facility at rocky flats asks sen 
timothy wirth dcolo 
while the size and scope of defense spending cuts are debated 
the military is pondering its future in a fastchanging world 
sullivan the army deputy chief of staff says his service 
already is implementing a new vision of a smaller army one 
with more mobility and fewer foreign bases but also one that could 
be easily expanded 
one question on the minds of recruiters as well as soldiers who 
survive manpower cuts is hows the job going to change 
colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff says one 
new chore will be fighting the drug war 
bushs 1991 budget calls for pentagon spending of 12 billion 
to combat illegal drugs thats less than onehalf of 1 percent of 
the total defense department budget request but it would mean a 
big increase in military resources to help in drug patrols along 
the border with mexico and in deployment of national guardsmen to 
stop drug trafficking 
marines have been assisting border patrol agents in drug 
surveillance since last fall also last summer bush sent about 65 
million worth of helicopters weapons and other military supplies 
to colombia to try to stem the flow of illegal drugs to america and 
to help colombia battle its drug cartel 
we are in this one for the long haul powell said of the 
pentagons antidrug mission

in a significant policy shift 
the staterun television news is giving south africans a chance to 
see for themselves the dramatic political changes taking place 
across the country 
the extensive live broadcast of nelson mandelas release after 
27 years in prison feb 11 was unprecedented for a spot news 
development the south african broadcasting corp scrapped much of 
its sunday programming to show mandelas walk to freedom 
for south african television reporters it was a new experience 
they rarely had been called upon to do live commentary 
but sabcs chief political reporter clarence keyter got caught 
up in the excitement repeatedly telling viewers they were about to 
watch history in the making 
he did not have the backup that western television 
correspondents have in such situations when the mandela story 
dragged his release was 75 minutes behind schedule the studio 
provided no pretaped biographies of mandela or other short 
features that could fill the intervals thus keyter was left to 
think of new things to say when nothing was going on at one point 
the commentator described victor verster prison as probably the 
most beautiful jail in the world 
a more lively openminded approach to news coverage began when 
president fw de klerk took over from pw botha six months ago 
botha had kept a close watch on the domestic television service and 
on at least one occasion called the newsroom in midbroadcast to 
order changes 
the nightly television news shows had the trappings of 
propaganda programs carefully filtering out disturbing scenes and 
opposition accusations while emphasizing the governments line on 
every issue 
but on the night of feb 2 after de klerk legalized 60 banned 
organizations and lifted restrictions on hundreds of government 
opponents white viewers listened to televised comments from a 
string of black activists they had been taught were among south 
africas worst enemies 
in recent months viewers have seen throngs of blacks chanting 
singing with fists and banners raised marching in protests that 
would have been mentioned if at all in a sentence or two 
without pictures a year ago 
much of the change is due to carel van der merwe a journalist 
with 25 years experience in broadcasting and newspapers who 
returned to sabc as director of news last august when de klerk 
came to power van der merwes view that television journalism 
should be gripping understandable and fair has made a 
striking difference in what people now see on the evening news 
the televising of mandelas speech at a cape town rally on the 
day of his release and his news conference the following day in 
which he endorsed the organizations guerrilla actions would have 
been illegal just a few weeks ago 
us television networks carried live material on mandelas 
release and his address to the rally sabc delayed its start of 
mandelas address which began while the regularly scheduled 
evening news was on but switched live after the news and all that 
was missed were tributes at the beginning said rob stevenson 
sabcs evening news editor 
sabc is run by a board appointed by the nations president and 
by law has a monopoly on news broadcasting although two 
independent radio stations in selfgoverning black homelands can be 
heard in some cities 
during the height of political unrest in 198486 most south 
africans never saw pictures of black protests stonings arson and 
police violence that the rest of the world saw government 
officials told them night after night that the unseen violence in 
their country was caused by leaders of the african national 
congress and the communist party who were never shown and were 
quoted only selectively and rarely 
sometimes the faces of people like anglican archbishop desmond 
tutu were shown speaking while the television announcer 
paraphrased their words 
tutus first voluntary appearance on sabc was last october in a 
debate on religion in politics in which he was allowed 15 unedited 
minutes to make his points the experience encouraged tutu who had 
once refused to answer questions from sabc reporters to give more 
interviews 
hes still rather cautious about it but people in the sabc 
have told us privately there are changes and it certainly appears 
to be getting out of the tight government control said tutus 
spokesman john allen the people working there appear to be 
conservative but the journalists are exercising more discretion 
cabinet ministers who were accustomed to giving uninterrupted 
and unchallenged speeches in response to soft queries from tv 
interviewers are now being questioned on national television by 
black reporters and editors from newspapers the government once 
tried to suppress 
one of the most dramatic changes in the approach to news was 
illustrated by a transportation strike in january when more than 
30 people were killed and millions of dollars of damage done to 
governmentowned railroad equipment amid the reports of clashes 
and violence the black leader of the south african railway and 
harbor workers union was on television giving his side of the 
story 
in contrast during a mine strike in 1987 one of the costliest 
and longest in south african history the leader of the black 
miners union was never heard from until the strike ended 
for years theyve had a kind of doctrine where the official 
view always takes precedence said gus silber a television news 
analyst and freelance writer in any story about unrest or 
political controversy they always led with the official response 
the opposite way that other journalists do things 
but gavin stewart a journalism professor at rhodes university 
says the new approach does not mean the sabc is independent of 
the government it just happens that government policy is now more 
reasonable 
the sabc is only changing because the official line is 
changing agreed silber until a couple of months ago the 
official line was the anc was a terrorist organization that was 
never to be spoken to now the anc gets the same treatment as other 
organizations 
antiapartheid activists are changing their attitudes too 
answering news conference questions from sabc reporters and 
agreeing to appear on broadcasts they once dismissed as government 
propaganda 
i think people realize it makes sense to put their point of 
view to viewers of the sabc who havent heard and dont usually 
hear it said moegsien williams editor of south a newspaper the 
government suspended in 1988 williams recently was part of a panel 
questioning foreign minister pik botha on national television 
when walter sisulu and six other anc leaders celebrated their 
release from prison in october rally organizers refused the sabc 
permission to set microphones near the stage television showed 
pictures of the meeting but could not broadcast the black leaders 
words 
now sisulu appears on television and radio regularly 
van der merwe said the overwhelmingly positive viewer response 
has encouraged sabc to carry on trying to be a good news medium 
to those shocked at seeing communists and former guerrilla 
leaders speaking on their television screens van der merwe said 
they will have to accept that their own viewpoint in life is not 
the only viewpoint

wellsgardner electronics corp manufactured 
televisions before the japanese were even a blip on the industry 
screen now theyre hoping to stage a comeback with a new line of 
usmade sets 
the accent is decidedly american in the companys deal with 
majestic industries inc a yearold marylandbased independent 
distributor managed by a team of former rca executives 
stamped made in america the new televisions will be built 
at wellsgardners plant on chicagos northwest side and marketed 
to middle america rural residents and suburbanites who prefer 
oldfashioned consolemodel tv sets 
some parts will be made in places like taiwan mexico and 
malaysia but the full assembly process will take place at the 
275000 squarefoot plant richard conquest the companys chief 
financial officer said in a telephone interview monday 
the company doesnt have any intention of trying to compete 
headon against japanese giants like sony and mitsubishi conquest 
said instead he said wellsgardner simply wants to get back into 
a business where it once played a leading role supplying 
privatelabel televisions 
thats our cup of tea conquest said were really excited 
about it 
the threeyear wellsgardner contract is designed to fill an 
industry void said james schwab president of majestic 
what we saw was that with the basic marketing most television 
manufacturing was aimed at the top 200300 retailers so their 
sales planning and product offerings were aimed at the top 
retailers he said 
this left a void with the independent retailer who needs 
local support from an independent distributor schwab said 
seventy percent of the sets wellsgardner plans to make will be 
traditional console models they will be sold under the majestic 
name through independent dealers rather than mass retailers like 
sears roebuck and co and jc penney co 
production starts this week with 24000 to 30000 sets 
scheduled to be built in the first year conquest said the sets 
should become available to consumers within a month 
it will add approximately 10 million to our 1990 sales 
conquest said that would represent about 30 percent of 1989s 
estimated sales of 35 million for now wellsgardner doesnt have 
any plans to build tvs for other distributors officials said but 
the company might consider similar deals in the future with 
retailers like highland silo and fretters 
wellsgardner was founded in 1924 as a radio manufacturer 
the company diversified in the television age and was one of the 
first makers of blackandwhite sets it was a major manufacturer 
of sets sold in stores like sears and penneys conquest said 
then in the 1970s the japanese came in and we got out of the 
tv business he said explaining that the company couldnt 
compete with cheaper overseas labor costs 
at the end of the 1970s the company decided to try again and 
began assembling sets for fujitsus teknika division 
but the japanese company deterred by high import duties and 
us labor costs decided not to renew the contract in 1988 
conquest said 
in the meantime wellsgardner has focused its energies on 
making monitors for coinoperated video games which account for 
about 60 percent of its sales 
it hopes the new deal will bring stability and help reduce its 
dependence on the cyclical video game industry said president 
frank j myers 
the company rejoins an industry now dominated by foreignowned 
firms like rca and sony and glenview illbased zenith 
electronics corp 
zenith is the only remaining americanowned manufacturer of 
color tvs that also makes most of its parts said bob violino 
associate editor at television digest a weekly newsletter that 
tracks the consumer electronics industry 
only a handful of smaller firms like wellsgardner also 
assemble their own sets in this country he said 
wellsgardners reentry wont cut into any of these other 
companies shares violino said 
zenith does not expect the move to affect its business company 
spokesman john taylor said

source perrier sas lions share of the us bottled water 
market could begin to evaporate if its recall of the popular 
perrier brand because of benzene contamination lasts for two 
months marketing experts say 
the bubbly water is being kept out of stores restaurants and 
bars in the united states and canada after north carolina officials 
found some bottles tainted with small amounts of benzene 
perrier said it believes an employee mistakenly used a product 
containing the cancercausing chemical to clean grease from one 
bottling line whose production was destined only for north 
america a spokesman for the french health ministry said there was 
no contamination at the spring from which the sparkling water flows 
although the benzene levels were relatively low about two to 
four times the five parts per billion level allowable under food 
and drug administration standards perrier said it requested the 
recall late friday to restore consumer confidence 
the companys us subsidiary perrier group of america inc 
said monday it expects to keep the product out of us and canadian 
markets for up to two or three months however a spokesman for the 
parent company in paris said the green bottles could be back on 
north american store shelves in a week or two 
the timing is more of a problem than the benzene said al 
ries chairman of trout amp ries inc a greenwich conn marketing 
strategy firm 
he said the absence of perrier for any extended time will 
severely test the loyalty of many consumers who may be used to 
drinking the sparking water several times a week 
perrier which turned bottled water into a status symbol several 
years ago accounts for nearly a quarter of the estimated 22 
billion in annual bottled water sales in the united states 
according to the new yorkbased beverage marketing corp 
brands are badges said ries by that i mean when you sit 
at a restaurant table and order a brand by name it says something 
about you personally not being available will force the consumer 
to ask for another brand name and the smart competitior is going 
to move in 
gary m stibel principal of new england consulting group of 
westport conn agreed its a godsend trial opportunity for its 
competitors if theyre smart enough to take advantage of it 
but experts questioned whether the numerous other smaller 
bottled water companies were strong enough to fill the temporary 
void left by perrier 
no one in the marketplace has seen fit to build a strong no 2 
brand in america if perrier goes flat said riesdistribution 
is the key the product has to be out there and the product has to 
be widely available 
there are about 450 water bottling plants in the united states 
producing more than 600 different brand labels of drinking water 
natural water and spring water according to bevmark inc a los 
angelesbased consulting firm in addition there are more than 50 
brands of imported waters bevmark said 
perrier also markets poland spring calistoga and arrowhead 
bottled waters 
key brand competitors include evian and saratoga both owned by 
bsn of france and san pellegrino of italy 
david s daniel chief executive officer of evian waters of 
france inc said his company had no intention of capitalizing on 
perriers problems although it plans to launch a major new 
advertising campaign in the next two weeks he said it was 
coincidence the campaign was starting right after the perrier 
recall 
right now we dont see any real need to change our strategy or 
adjust our spending daniel said its pretty much business as 
usual 
many marketing experts likened perriers problem to that of 
johnson amp johnson which recalled its tylenol pain killer in 1982 
after some capsules were tainted with cyanide resulting in several 
deaths 
some of the marketers criticized perriers relatively lowkey 
public relations approach to the problem which seemed to contrast 
with johnson amp johnsons fullscale public information campaign 
that campaign was credited with helping the company regain market 
share following the tylenol scare 
but others said perriers total recall even though only a 
dozen bottles were believed to be contaminated was more than 
enough to reassure consumers

drexel burnham lambert inc which rose to 
prominence by pioneering the market for highrisk junk bonds and 
using them to fuel the 1980s takeover boom now finds itself 
looking for outside help because of its deteriorating junk bond 
holdings 
the firms announcement monday that it was seeking a major 
investor or merger partner followed three days of marathon talks 
with federal regulators who worried that a collapse of drexel 
would shake public confidence in the nations financial markets 
the new york times reported 
securities industry analysts and former drexel executives echoed 
those concerns they said the firms difficulties with the 
declining junkbond market it helped create and its 1989 guilty 
plea to federal securities fraud crimes could deter potential 
investors 
at this point i think the biggest problem is the loss of 
confidence in them said chris mahoney a securities industry 
analyst with moodys investors service who would want to do 
business with them if they were a risk not to make it 
drexel announcement was another sign of decline at the firm once 
so sure of itself that it made commitments to raise hundreds of 
millions of dollars by merely saying it was highly confident in 
its abilities 
analysts said drexels capital base been reduced to a minimum 
level and that without an infusion the firm could fail to meet 
federal capital requirements 
individuals familiar with drexels internal problems said 
confidence was at an alltime low and several key executives had 
left in recent months pending litigation from its fraud woes also 
still plague the firm which has shrunk to 5300 employees from a 
peak of 10700 
financial service companies are confidence and people one 
former drexel executive said theres obviously no confidence and 
the best people have left 
led by junkbond chief michael milken who pioneered use of the 
lowgrade debt securities for multibilliondollar takeovers but 
left after his indictment last year on fraud and racketeering 
charges drexel was a symbol of the highflying takeoverdriven 
1980s 
but the departure of milken and other top performers combined 
with the big slump in the nations 210 billion junk bond market 
has hit drexel hard its large positions in corporate junk bonds 
have nosedived weakening the firms capital base 
theres no other line of business to keep them strong in order 
to make up the difference said analyst lawrence eckenfelder of 
prudentialbache securities inc 
the firms total capitalization the money it relies on to back 
its commitments and meet any losses shrank to 17 billion at the 
end of 1989 from 196 billion in 1988 leading to rumors on wall 
street that drexel was on the verge of being sold or collapsing 
drexel is the biggest player in the junk bond market so if its 
financial straits forced it to sell its holdings prices could drop 
sharply in a junk market already weakened by months of bad news 
in mondays statement drexel said its senior members had 
concluded it should seek outside assistance because unsettled 
markets particularly in the highyield area have adversely 
affected the liquidity of its parent drexel burnham lambert 
group inc 
drexel said its securities subsidiary continues to have good 
liquidity and has satisfactory excess regulatory capital 
the firm last week began to shift cash to the strapped parent 
from its securities subsidiary but the move alarmed officials at 
the federal reserve and the securities and exchange commission who 
feared it might weaken the subsidiary the times reported 
on monday drexel agreed with the government to sell assets and 
raise bank loans to keep the firm afloat the times said the fed 
requested that citibank drexels chief bank for years and morgan 
guaranty provide financing while drexel gets its house in order 
the newspaper said 
fed and sec officials remain directly involved in efforts to 
rescue drexel the newspaper said 
a drexel spokesman said the firm was acting on its own 
initiative to raise capital 
weve been in touch with the regulators all along spokesman 
steven anreder said i dont think theyre dictating what we do 
as a business entity 
federal reserve spokesman joseph coyne said he was unaware of 
any such role by the fed mary mccue a spokeswoman for the 
securities and exchange commission declined to comment 
the times also reported that the new york stock exchange had set 
up a crisis center on drexel and that exchange chairman john phelan 
had assured the exchanges board of governors that the firms 
problems were being tackled 
exchange spokeswoman sharon gamsin declined to comment on the 
report saying only that drexel burnham is currently a member in 
good standing 
jeffrey bowman a vice president at standard amp poors corp 
said the firms capital is at a minimum level 
after drexels announcement sampp downgraded its rating on 200 
million of the firms commercial paper to single b from 
a3 securities firms rely on the issuance of commercial paper 
to finance their business and the rating downgrade would force 
drexel to pay higher interest on its borrowings 
repayment of outstanding commercial paper will depend on the 
firms ability to negotiate a capital infusion or alternative 
sources of liquidity sampp said 
drexel reported a loss of 40 million on 41 billion in revenue 
for last year when it paid 650 million to settle the fraud 
charges slashed its work force by nearly one half sold its retail 
brokerage business and overhauled its internal operations under a 
civil settlement with the securities and exchange commission 
the firm had made a net profit of 523 million 951 million 
before taxes on revenue of 53 billion in 1986

safeway stores plans to issue a modest 
amount of stock to the public marks the beginning of the final 
chapter in one of the nations most successful leveraged buyouts 
i dont know of any leveraged buyouts that have numbers like 
they have said brian suher an analyst with the brokerage black 
amp co in portland ore 
suher was referring to safeways reduction of a staggering 57 
billion buyout debt to 31 billion and its surging operating 
profits in the past year the oaklandbased chain achieved the 
turnaround largely by eliminating its least profitable stores in 
reducing the size of the chain from 2326 stores to 1117 
analysts for the past year have praised the buyout for forcing 
safeway to accelerate a restructuring and trim itself quickly to 
its most profitable core 
chairman and chief executive peter magowan recently boasted that 
although sales last year were 143 billion safeways operating 
income was greater than when it posted annual sales of 20 billion 
those numbers are the stuff of dreams that fueled the buyout 
craze of the 1980s 
in a leveraged buyout a small group of investors acquires a 
company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing the debt 
often nearly crippling is repaid with money generated by the 
acquired companys operations or the sale of its assets 
the lbo as its commonly known is often used by management to 
retain control of a company threatened by a hostile suitor the 
idea is for the company to reemerge later as a public one 
stronger and more profitable and thereby less subject to takeovers 
the ability of a company to reenter the public market also is 
crucial to managers hopes of eventually cashing in their stakes 
and reaping big profits from the turnaround 
the stock sale announced monday and the first since the nov 
30 1986 buyout was a show of confidence by the nations 
thirdlargest supermarket chain 
the offering of 10 million shares of new common stock will sell 
for between 13 and 16 a share after the offering the company 
will have 100 million shares outstanding 
company officials and those at kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
the new york investment firm that managed the buyout said monday 
they could not comment publicly on the offering because of 
restraints by the securities and exchange commission 
the remaking of safeway began in july 1986 with a hostile tender 
offer from the dart group corp led by herbert and robert haft 
that attempt forced safeway to agree to be acquired by kohlberg 
kravis that fall for 69 a share the deal left safeway management 
in command and offered certain officers the right to buy 10 percent 
of the now closely held concern 
the deal also left safeway burdened with debt a staggering 45 
in debt for each dollar in equity one of the highest such ratios 
ever in a large deal 
to restore profitability safeway has been building larger 
stores called super stores that offer specialty departments 
such as bakeries delicatessens pharmacies seafood counters and 
floral and wine shops 
to offer more services and longer hours safeway employees 
hours have gone up 23 percent per store in the past two years 
safeway was able to win significant contract concessions from its 
unions and wages are now only slightly higher than in 1986 
the buyout has been lauded as mutually beneficial by both 
safeway and kohlberg krravis which also acquired rjr nabisco in 
the nations biggest leveraged buyout after a fierce bidding 
contest 
in most cases safeway sold operations that were 
underperforming exceptions were safeway stores in britain which 
garnered a strong price and 172 southern california stores sold to 
the von cos in a 408 million deal that transaction also made 
safeway the largest shareholder in vons the biggest supermarket 
chain in the los angeles area 
the performance improvement is nothing short of sensational 
but more importantly the public has endorsed their operating 
formats suher said 
theyre having marvelous increases because they have changed 
from a behemoth that was insensitive to a corporation very very 
sensitive to consumers and communities 
safeway finished the year with a 3 million profit on 143 
billion in sales its first profitable year since the buyout 
operating profits jumped 42 percent for the year to 463 
million and 805 percent in the fourth quarter to 139 million

georgiapacific corp and great northern 
nekoosa corp intensified their merger fight accusing each other 
of wrongdoing shortly after georgiapacific sold off assets in 
three states to eliminate a potential antitrust problem 
great northern said georgiapacific and three of its key 
executives have lied during the 38 billion takeover attempt 
georgiapacific then accused great northerns directors of 
breaching their fiduciary duty by resisting the offer 
most of the developments on monday were in federal court in 
portland where great northern told us district judge gene carter 
that georgiapacifics tender offer should be blocked because the 
hostile suitor has lied about an alleged plan to sell great 
northerns mills in millinocket and east millinocket as well as 21 
million acres of maine 
gp is lying theyre not telling you their true plans said 
great northern attorney bernard nussbaum of new york nussbaum 
asked carter for a preliminary injunction halting the merger 
attempt as well as georgiapacifics efforts to oust the great 
northern board at a special shareholders meeting on march 2 in 
portland 
georgiapacific attorney stuart j baskin accused great northern 
of pandering to the poor people in maine through an unfair 
motion that has no basis in law baskin also of new york said 
georgiapacific has produced depositions and affidavits from 14 
people including georgiapacific executives consultants and 
bankers who dispute great northerns contentions about a planned 
sale of the maine properties 
great northern said georgiapacific has violated federal 
securities laws by trying to cover up its alleged plans 
nussbaum citing documents dating to at least 1984 said false 
statements have come from three georgiapacific officials chairman 
t marshall hahn jr and executive vice presidents ad pete 
correll jr and james c van meter 
georgiapacific spokeswoman gail smith said the company stands 
by all of its sworn statements 
the judge said he would rule as quickly as possible 
after mondays contentious hearing lawyers met in chambers with 
the judge and agreed to unseal a motion for a preliminary 
injunction filed last month by georgiapacific it alleges great 
northerns directors have breached their fiduciary duty by 
resisting the tender offer 
great northern has called the 63ashare offer inadequate but 
georgiapacific said that great northerns investment banker 
goldman sachs amp co conducted a study last spring that put the 
value of great northerns stock at somewhere between 4639 per 
share and 6875 per share 
the motion asks the judge to force great northern to rule out 
the use of its poison pill bylaws that are designed to thwart a 
hostile takeover and to strike down golden parachute payments 
that will be given to great northerns executives if they lose 
their jobs in the battle 
georgiapacific also asked the judge to force great northerns 
directors to refrain from using maines antitakeover act to block 
the merger and to correct alleged misleading statements about its 
plans to invest money that would rebuild its aging mill in 
millinocket georgiapacific has called great northerns previously 
announced plans for maine a pipe dream 
great northern issued a statement that said the goldman sachs 
study was stale and originally prepared for a different 
purpose than evaluating a bid for the company georgiapacific 
acknowledged that it did not know what methodology was used in 
computing the stock value 
also monday great northern filed papers saying it wanted to 
pursue a speedy appeal of an order last week from carter who ruled 
it will take just a twothirds vote by great northerns 
shareholders to oust the great northern board great northerns 
bylaws called for a threefourths vote but the judge agreed with 
georgiapacific that twothirds was the most allowed under maine 
corporate law 
the judge also ruled that shareholders and not the outgoing 
board members can immediately replace the directors if they are 
ousted as he struck down other aspects of great northerns bylaws 
before the court battle on monday georgiapacific announced it 
had agreed to sell safetypaper operations in vermont iowa and new 
york to remove an antitrust question in the takeover attempt 
the company said it was selling facilities in gilman vt and 
burlington iowa to seattlebased simpson paper co for a price 
that would not be disclosed unless lawyers are forced to do so in a 
separate lawsuit in federal court in bridgeport conn the deal 
also calls for the sale of two wet process machines and a precision 
sheeter in warwick ny

the nations auto dealers are approaching the 
big threes quick oilchange operation offers cautiously wondering 
if the investment is worth the return 
general motors corp and ford motor co are offering packages to 
dealers who want to offer oil changes that would take about a half 
hour and cost around 20 
typically quick oil changes involve a new oil filter oil spot 
lubrication on doors and some suspension joints filling brake and 
windshield washer reservoirs and checking tire pressure 
dozens of companies have sprung up nationwide offering the 
service in drivethrough bays and the idea is a topic among 
members of the national automobile dealers association which is 
holding its annual convention here 
the idea is to get consumers into the dealerships service area 
on a routine nonwarranty basis that can result in increased 
service or parts business and quickly become the bread and butter 
for the dealers 
many of the nations 20000plus auto dealers about half of 
whom are not making money rely on profits generated by their parts 
and service departments to keep them financially afloat the setup 
also would profit the automakers inhouse parts operations 
but money stands in the way for tony fuentes general manager of 
don thornton ford of tulsa okla he said the ford program which 
includes a lift closeathand tools and parts would cost him 
24000 
in the past he said people would not think of a 
dealership for this stuff you went to dealerships for warranty 
work 
once the warranty expires bang they go off to an 
independent mechanic 
wayne phillips a consultant for the nada said hes found that 
dealers are interested in the operations but cautious about them 
in some areas it can be a very profitable thing he said 
especially if the dealership is on a busy street 
ford was the first to offer quick oil changes nationwide five 
dealer in chicago had it in june 1988 that number grew to 25 by 
october 1988 general motors corp started a pilot program at about 
100 dealerships in and around four manor cities in 1989 and 
chrysler corp also has some dealers offering the service 
dealers are approaching the offers in a variety of methods 
colonial dodge in rockville md offers an oil change and quick 
lubrication for 995 
we want more traffic in the back of the service department 
where more expensive work is performed said al briggs general 
manager of the dealership 
george hornbeck iii owner of hornbeck chevroletcadillac in 
carbondale pa isnt interested in the operations 
i kind of think im not going to go that way he said im 
not ready to put that money out for something i already do

integrated resources inc once the nations 
biggest seller of taxsheltered investments sought federal 
bankruptcy protection today after talks with creditors collapsed on 
restructuring more than 1 billion in debt much of it in 
highyield junk bonds 
the troubled financial firms filing came a day after drexel 
burnham lambert inc the wall street junk bond giant that has 
foundered because of scandal and financial problems said it was 
seeking financial help integrated was an important drexel client 
integrateds filing under chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws 
protects the real estate and financial services company from 
creditors while it continues to operate and attempts to reorganize 
its finances 
the company said none of its subsidiaries and affiliates is 
included in the filing made in us bankruptcy court in manhattan 
we came to the conclusion probably a couple months ago that 
wed have to file eventually in order to deal with issues unrelated 
to a consensual restructuring of the debt integrated chairman 
stephen d weinroth said in an interview 
weinroth said the company was forced into the filing because 
several creditors who refused to negotiate a restructuring had 
filed or planned to file legal complaints seeking more than 40 
million owed by the firm 
trading in integrated was halted today on the new york stock 
exchange integrated closed at 25 cents a share on monday 
integrated originally was a real estate company and expanded 
rapidly several years ago by selling taxsheltered investments but 
that business was scuttled by 1986 taxlaw revisions the company 
then moved aggressively into insurance and mutual funds financed 
largely through junk bonds arranged by drexel 
integrated said negotiations for restructuring 1008 billion in 
debt had been progressing but a few creditors refused to 
participate in the talks the company said those creditors had the 
ability to seize integrateds assets to satisfy their individual 
claims 
about 800 million of the debt was in junk bonds the bulk of it 
sold by drexel whose parent company said today it too is 
considering filing for chapter 11 protection 
we were spending too much time and too much money trying to 
stave off actions where the ultimate outcome was not in doubt 
weinroth said sooner or later they were going to get a judgment 
working out a consensual outof court reorganization depends on 
the good faith of substantially all the creditors 
according to court papers filed this morning integrated also 
has 610 million in subordinated debt outstanding 
weinroth said the firms assets currently are about 1 billion 
less than liabilities according to its balance sheet for june 
1989 the most recent filed integrated had total assets of 14 
billion and a negative net worth of 558 million its total debt 
was 162 billion 
the firm has estimated it lost about 1 billion in the second 
quarter and the company is estimating a large loss believed to be 
around 200 million for the 1989 third quarter 
according to the bankruptcy court papers integrated said its 
top 10 creditors included large banks and savings and loans which 
bought much of the junkbond debt issued by drexel under its 
indicted former bond leader michael milken 
manufacturers hanover trust co led all creditors with a total 
owed of 5584 million followed by chemical bank with 5157 
million the rest of the top 10 were 
executive life insurance co 488 million in longterm public 
debt hong kong shanghai banking corp 45 million in public and 
private debt drexel 41105 million in total debt exposure 
imperial savings and loan 3998 million in public debt centrust 
savings and loan 39 million in public debt canadian imperial 
bank of commerce 33195 million total usx portfolio inc 2409 
million in commercial paper and mellon bank 22596 million total 
earlier this year integrated sold its key financial services 
businesses to broad inc a los angeles financial services concern 
for 95 million the company had hoped to receive about 450 
million for the units 
other units were either liquidated or sold to other parties and 
weinroth said the firm has sold about 175 million in assets so far 
integrated said it expects to resume talks with creditors soon

digital equipment corp plagued recently by slow 
us sales today formally announced formation of a joint venture 
company to sell and service its computer systems in hungary 
digital the worlds second largest computer company behind 
international business machines corp said in a news release from 
budapest that the new venture called digital equipment hungary 
ltd will begin operations april 2 
history has shown that information technology can often be a 
lubricant of change said alberto fresco vice president and 
country group manager of digital in europe as hungary moves 
forward with its plans to restructure its economy computers will 
play an important role 
the opening of new markets in eastern europe would be a welcome 
development for us computer makers which have been mired in a 
slump digital reported last month that its profit for the 
octoberdecember quarter fell 44 percent from a year earlier 
because of the slow us computer market 
eastern europe represents one of the few untapped markets that 
have longterm potential said terry shannon an analyst with 
international data corp a computer market researcher in 
framingham 
given the changes in the geopolitical climate this is 
laudatory on digitals part shannon said 
digital will control the hungarian venture owning 51 percent 
it has the option of acquiring 100 percent of the joint venture 
company and forming a wholly owned subsidiary in the future the 
remaining 49 percent will be split equally between kfki a research 
institute of the hungarian academy of sciences and szamalk a 
software company 
digital based in the boston suburb of maynard explored the 
possibility of doing business in eastern europe about a year ago by 
sending representatives to poland czechoslovakia and hungary 
the group found that hungary was furthest along in political and 
economic reforms and had relatively strong development in 
technology 
digitals activity in eastern europe has been severely limited 
since the soviet invasion of afghanistan in 1979 prompted tighter 
us trade restrictions with the eastern bloc 
before then however digital had significant business in 
that region said robert krause senior trade representative for 
digital 
the company now hopes restrictions will be eased by the 
coordinating committee on multilateral export controls an agency 
with representatives from most nato countries japan and australia 
that regulates what technology can be exported to eastern europe 
although digital has been unable to sell much of its equipment 
in eastern europe its machinery has been imported through illicit 
channels and computer makers there have tried to duplicate digital 
products 
fredrickson the digital spokesman said the company has not 
decided whether to service those machines 
shannon the analyst said i wouldnt recognize the existence 
of a pirated machine 
but shannon added that even if digital does not service the 
equipment it will have an advantage in marketing its products 
because the illicit base creates a familiarity with digital 
hardware and operating systems

ive been at it since i was 18 many well known organizations 
offered to be my partner in buying gulfstream but i chose to team

ibm said today that it has become the first 
company to start pilot production of a 16millionbit computer 
memory chip which has four times the memory capacity of todays 
most advanced chips 
currently the largestcapacity chips in commercial use hold 4 
million bits of information 
a bit is the smallest piece of information processed by a 
computer and can be thought of as the digits 1 or 0 it represents 
an electrical switch either being turned on or off 
a 16millionbit chip can store the equivalent of about 1600 
pages of doublespaced typewritten text 
international business machines corp announced just last june 
that it had started commercial production of the 4millionbit chip 
ibm spokesman paul bergevin said the company based in armonk 
ny has been researching 16millionbit chips for several years 
the company said it recently began producing the chips on a trial 
basis at its semiconductor plant in essex junction vt on an 
existing chip assembly line 
bergevin said commercial volume production of the new chip 
could be 18 months to two years away all the chips ibm makes are 
used in its own computers 
other companies are known to be working on 16millionbit chips 
but none so far has announced production bergevin said 
last month ibm announced that it had entered into a joint 
venture with siemens ag the large west germany electronics 
company to develop a 64millionbit chip which would be the next 
gereration of chips because of the way chips are constructed 
advances usually take place in intervals of four times greater 
capacity than the previous generation

lincoln savings and loan association spent 55 
million more than phoenix millionaire charles h keating jr paid 
for the thrift in an 18month battle with federal examiners over 
its loans and investments keatings key aide said today 
judith wischer president of the thrifts holding company 
american continental corp testified in us district court that 
an examination expected to be a routine sixmonth audit escalated 
into a battle of experts 
testifying on keatings suit to undo the governments takeover 
of the irvine calif thrift last april mrs wischer said the 
government auditors had little or no experience with lincolns 
investments in bonds or large loans for commercial real estate and 
construction projects 
its a shocking number she said of lincolns cost in 
answering questions and demands by the examiners we hired 
experts to critique the reports their experts critiqued we estmate 
the 18month examination cost of 55 million 
keating has said previously that he viewed the 198687 exam as 
harassment and has cited it as a reason for taking his case against 
the regulators to members of congress whose political campaigns he 
helped finance 
mrs wischer testified earlier that lincolns 26 branches in the 
los angeles area were run down and dirty when keating 
bought the thrift in february 1984 for 51 million 
it was a dying institution she said the operation side 
was almost nonexistent they were still operating with manual 
typewriters had no atms automatic teller machines and no 
communications system for relaying messages quickly between 
branches and headquarters 
government attorneys repeatedly objected monday to questions by 
keatings lawyers to mrs wischer about a fouryear running battle 
between lincoln and its regulators however us district court 
judge stanley sporkin overruled the objections 
im trying to get a backdrop here the judge said 
in seven previous days of testimony the government called 
keating his son and a soninlaw as hostile witnesses in pressing 
their motion to dismiss keatings suit 
mrs wischer testified that american continental turned lincoln 
from a losing home mortgage lender into a nearly 7 billion empire 
and an aggressive and profitable investor in stocks junk bonds and 
real estate 
in its takeover the government said those investments using 
federally insured deposits constituted unsafe and unsound 
practices that could cost taxpayers up to 2 billion losses 
keating says never would have occurred if regulators had kept their 
hands off his business 
mrs wischer said american continental developed interest in 
acquiring a thrift as a result of a 1982 law that effectively 
allowed thrifts to directly invest up to 40 percent of their 
deposits in stocks bonds and real estate 
using high interest rates to lure new deposits put together by 
brokers keating turned lincoln from a 1 billion operation to one 
with 23 billion in assets some 440 million of it in direct 
investments within a year 
but in february 1985 the new owners began running into trouble 
with regulators at the 11th district federal home loan bank in san 
francisco mrs wischer said 
although federal examiners that month gave lincoln a relatively 
clean bill of health and california regulators had given it 
permission to make up to 950 million in direct investments she 
testified the federal home loan bank of san francisco began 
questioning its operations 
the examination went extremely well she said but we 
began having trouble with the supervisory agent who reported to a 
12member board at the san francisco bank composed of our 
competitors 
mrs wischer said lincoln vigorously opposed pending regulations 
before the bank board in washington that cut allowable direct 
investments back to 10 percent of a thrifts assets 
the proposed regulations were modified several times but when 
finally adopted in february 1985 lincoln unsuccessfully sought 
waivers including direct appeals to members of congress 
as part of that campaign mrs wischer said american continental 
commissioned alan greenspan now chairman of the federal 
reserve board but then a private consultant to write a report 
supporting lincolns investments and management 
the campaign eventually grew to include raising millions of 
dollars for the political causes of lawmakers sympathetic to 
keatings case including 13 million for five us senators 
the five sens dennis deconcini dariz john mccain 
rariz john glenn dohio donald w riegle jr dmich and 
alan cranston dcalif are now under investigation by the senate 
ethics committee on charges they improperly interceded with 
regulators on keatings behalf

eastern european nations are undergoing sweeping political and 
economic change there promises to be a most difficult transition 
ahead with respect to both 
these economies have found that the growth model formulated 
under stalinist domination cannot provide satisfactory improvement 
in living standards with the gap between east and west growing and 
the price of bureaucratic mismanagement brought home more sharply 
day by day in terms of worker unrest 
what are the prospects that reforms can restore economic 
dynamism to eastern europe 
the prospects vary considerably the two major determinants of 
likely success are financial health at the outset and the extent to 
which reformers are willing to privatize and integrate with the 
rest of the world 
in some in an effort to prop up living standards in the face of 
sagging growth former regimes oversaw the buildup of an 
overwhelming debt this debt took two forms foreign loans and a 
lack of domestic investment 
in all these countries bureaucratic mismanagement and 
artificially set prices have resulted in serious imbalances and 
poor preparation for changing world market conditions to maintain 
cheap basic goods and avoid unemployment intricate subsidy systems 
have been established this has led to shoddy goods higher 
inflationary pressure and reduced incentives for people to work 
hard 
the answers for the economies of eastern europe lie in 
privatizing them to restore incentives to workers pulling down 
artificial barriers between domestic and international markets 
spurring the efficiency of domestic enterprises and allowing the 
inflow of western investment 
privatizing means both absorbing some of the financial liquidity 
of the population in the disposal of stateowned productive assets 
and relying more directly on the profit motive western investment 
would bring in resources to renovate aging capital stock inject 
more uptodate technology and improve the competitiveness of 
exports service sectors have been neglected and offer fertile 
ground for enterprises attractive in some cases to western 
investors 
even in the countries with the brightest prospects 
czechoslovakia east germany and hungary reforms must go 
radically in the direction of a dominant private enterprise sector 
this will mean a painful transition during which much economic and 
social dislocation is bound to take place 
will western investors respond to the opportunities offered in 
eastern europe there are a number of reasons to think that even 
prudent investors can find them attractive 
the region offers the lowest labor costs of all industrialized 
countries workers are relatively welleducated and highly skilled 
expected movements in exchange rates will mean moreover even more 
favorable comparison of wage rates vs potential investments 
elsewhere 
turning around east european economies will certainly require 
determination farsightedness a helping hand from western 
governments a reawakening of entrepreneurial spirit at home and a 
good deal of luck 
there is no reason to believe however that an appropriate 
combination of radically new policies could not bring new dynamism 
and a real transformation for some of these economies with a 
timeframe of about 15 years or somewhat longer

when sybron corp negotiated a joint venture in budapest talks 
stalled while attorneys for the hungarian partners grappled to 
translate profit 
it was difficult to put the word profit in the contract in 
hungarian so we wrote it in german said donald rackl chief 
financial officer for the milwaukee manufacturer 
sybron weathered that and many other problems starting its first 
business in eastern europe the company expects to dance around 
bigger business potholes when its microscopeslide plant starts 
production this year 
even a veteran like pepsico inc after years of operating in 
the region has altered the way it normally does business in order 
to cope with problems alien to the west 
pepsi plants in czechoslovakia sometimes run out of bottles due 
to late shipments in the ukraine state officials snatch soft 
drink delivery trucks to haul harvested wheat said richard norton 
pepsico vice president for eastern europe 
adapting to such inconveniences is part of reality in countries 
still shaking off the dust of communist rule less easily overcome 
are structural and economic problems rapid inflation huge foreign 
debt and inconvertible currencies that make it difficult to turn 
profits into dollars 
in many respects the revolution in eastern europe remains only 
a promise several countries havent written laws on foreign 
ownership and joint ventures they lack legal systems and courts 
leaving western businesses vulnerable if for example suppliers 
dont deliver and customers dont pay 
yet for all the problems eastern europe may well represent the 
greatest commercial and financial opportunity since the rebuilding 
of western europe after world war ii the regions 136 million 
consumers crave everything from french fries to shoe polish 
telephones to computer disks 
for companies with global aspirations and patience for profits 
eastern europe is a pot of gold said chicago university 
business professor marvin zonis 
there are real possibilities out there and they ought to be 
pursued zonis said 
the commerce departments own analysts have said firms dealing 
in agriculture health care telecommunications energy tourism 
and housing may have the best chance of gaining entry and 
prospering in east european markets 
there are plenty of reasons for american companies to invest 
cheap labor is one of the biggest the average hourly manufacturing 
wage in hungary poland and yugoslavia in 1988 was 135 to 171 
said planecon inc a washington research concern specializing in 
eastern europe 
wages could even fall in dollar terms because of an expected 
decline in exchange rates 
moreover east european workers are relatively well educated and 
highly trained compared with third world counterparts low labor 
productivity may be a concern but some economists say thats 
correctable 
workers get lazy and depressed when they get stuck with guys 
who are doing a bad job of running things said edward yardeni 
chief economist at prudentialbache securities inc 
perhaps the biggest incentive for us corporations to invest in 
eastern europe is global competition us giants like general 
electric co international business machines corp and general 
motors corp are already there but so are rivals suzuki motor co 
siemens ag west germanys giant electronics company ferruzzi 
finanziara spa italys leading chemical and agribusiness company 
and british telecom others are on the way 
eugene theroux an attorney in the washington office of the 
international law firm baker amp mckenzie said its a mistake for 
american businesses to sit back and watch 
they should make at least a minimum of time effort and 
expense necessary to examine the alternatives said theroux who 
advises companies doing business in communist countries 
many companies apparently are doing just that the commerce 
department and chamber of commerce said they are receiving at least 
10 times as many inquiries as last year from american companies 
on everything from investment laws to opportunities and licensing 
commerce secretary robert a mosbacher opened an information office 
on eastern europe in january to handle all the calls 
lawyers travel agents and public relations firms are leading 
the way establishing offices and advertising for western clients 
cautious optimism has been replaced by opportunism said 
richard w edelman president of new yorkbased edelman public 
relations worldwide which has opened offices in hungary and is 
scouting elsewhere 
but american executives already experienced in eastern europe 
warn newcomers to calculate the risks many early joint ventures in 
the soviet union failed for lack of a careful business plan those 
who decide to go should be prepared to stay awhile 
this is an investment that will have longterm rewards instead 
of a shortterm immediate impact said andrew b somers jr 
general counsel for american express corp which has offices in 
several east european countries this is not something you dabble 
in 
companies in the vanguard also must be prepared to sacrifice 
time andnalds discovered 
opening its first restaurant in moscow 
the opening took mcdonalds 14 years 50 million and its own 
supply system that bypasses the deadly soviet bureacracy 
while the soviet union is considered more treacherous for 
enterprising westerners economists say eastern europe is similar 
right now if i were an american company i would think the 
prospects were very risky given the political and economic 
transition said georgetown university professor stewart brown 
congress has authorized 300 million in aid for private 
enterprise in poland and hungary as well as other assistance the 
federal exportimport bank will guarantee loans up to 200 million 
to hungary and yugoslavia 
but us companies will have to rely largely on their own 
resources to establish outposts in eastern europe 
anyone not prepared to suffer losses should not go in brown 
said

western europe is proffering aid 
eagerly to the deprived east but some european community members 
see the aspirations of their neighbors as both a benefit and danger 
to the economic blocs own integration 
political upheavals in the east bloc have raised new commercial 
opportunities at the same time some worry that the huge task of 
aiding iron curtain economies could be deemed more politically 
urgent than the communitys plans to remove the economic barriers 
dividing the dozen west european nations 
furthermore some of the communitys poorer nations such as 
portugal and greece worry that the group might direct resources to 
the east at their expense 
the community is running enormous risks because the pace 
of events has fueled the debate on european integration said 
jacques delors president of the european commission the trading 
blocs executive body 
the community must speed up the pace of european integration 
if it is to remain a focal point for others he said in a recent 
speech to the european parliament the communitys legislative body 
an ambitious integration plan by the community scheduled for 
1992 envisions a europeanwide market of 320 illion consumers 
unfettered by trade barriers the plan would create a monetary 
union with a common currency and central bank and fashion closer 
political cooperation in such areas as foreign policy 
belgium britain denmark france west germany greece 
ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands portugal and spain 
make up the community 
integration plans have not met blanket approval prime minister 
margaret thatcher for example is reluctant to make british 
monetary policy subject to a single european monetary union 
but leaders of the community also known as the common market 
have been united in the desire to help the emerging democracies in 
eastern europe convert their centrally planned economies into 
freemarket systems 
the new governments must deal with poor economic growth high 
inflation a lack of investment money and infrastructure and in 
some cases huge foreign debts 
heavily indebted poland for instance has virtually no banking 
network to support the free enterprise system needed for a 
marketdriven economy 
there are real doubts as to whether this thing can go through 
tidily even whether the transition to market economies can be 
carried through at all completely said peter ludlow director of 
the center for european policy studies a brusselsbased think tank 
the community already has directed substantial resources toward 
eastern european economic revitalization in the aftermath of the 
regions political upheaval 
aid ranging from free food to technical assistance and cash for 
improving agricultural and industrial production has been sent or 
promised to hungary and poland for example 
the community last summer was put in charge of a 24nation 
effort to devise an economic aid package for poland and hungary 
pledges have been received for a special 1 billion fund for 
poland and the west european nations recently agreed to establish 
a development bank to provide lowcost loans and other technical 
and economic assistance to eastern europe 
delors has suggested using what he called an extreme example 
that it could take 23 billion a year over the next five to 10 
years to help achieve economic reform in eastern europe 
however any call for a sizable increase in community spending 
likely would cause heated debate the communitys 1990 budget has 
been set at about 565 billion with just over half designated for 
farm programs 
an aid package for 66 poor nations in africa the caribbean and 
the pacific recently was pegged at 145 billion over five years 
willy de clercq chairman of the european parliaments external 
economic affairs committee acknowledged that poor countries might 
be concerned about future aid but he said it would be a wrong for 
the trading bloc to ignore other parts of the world 
there also is speculation that the rich nations especially west 
germany will be more inclined to channel money to the east than to 
the southern nations of spain portugal italy and greece the 
communitys weak spots 
a mark for leipzig is a mark less for lisbon goes one 
saying a reference the possible spending of west german capital in 
east germany rather than in portugal 
de clercq and others maintained the community would not neglect 
its own interests 
we dont see developments in eastern europe as a possible 
enemy of the greek economy said a greek official who asked not 
to be quoted by name after joining the community in 1981 greece 
received 62 billion over seven years to help modernize 
agricultural groups are concerned that tariff reductions and 
other special treatment for products grown by eastern farmers may 
hurt their markets 
we know we must help these countries but we must be 
careful not to create big difficulties here said andre 
herlitska secretarygeneral of the committee of professional farm 
organizations a group of community farm unions 
the european commission already has negotiated broad trade 
agreements with poland hungary and the soviet union to lift import 
limits and give their products greater access to west european 
markets 
there is a smaller arrangement with czechoslovakia likely to be 
expanded and bargaining for accords with east germany and bulgaria 
is under way the community also is taking steps to improve ties 
with romania 
trade between the community and east bloc amounted to 546 
billion in 1988 about half with the soviet union by comparison 
twoway trade with the united states that year was more than three 
times that amount

week compared with 583 million in the previous week and 459

chrysler corp said today it had a 
fourthquarter loss of 664 million including onetime 
restructuring charges of 577 million 
chrysler said the costs included idling plants in detroit and 
st louis discontinuing some car lines and reducing the 
whitecollar work force 
its called restructuring to compete chrysler chairman lee 
a iacocca said at a news conference 
more than half the fourthquarter restructuring charge of 577 
million was for supplemental unemployment benefits and retirement 
benefits connected with plant closings iacocca said the charge 
sliced 248 off pershare earnings 
chrysler said the loss was equivalent to 290 a share compared 
with fourthquarter net earnings of 433 million or 185 a share 
in 1988 sales for the quarter sagged to 79 billion compared 
with 93 billion a year earlier 
for the year chrysler reported net income of 359 million or 
155 a share on revenue of 349 billion that compares with 1988 
net income of 1 billion or 466 a share on revenue of 342 
billion in 1988 
iacocca said the results would mean no profit sharing for hourly 
workers and no bonuses for salaried employees at the nations 
thirdlargest automaker 
the earnings report came shortly after chrysler announced it had 
agreed to sell its gulfstream aerospace corporate jet manufacturing 
unit for 825 million in a cashraising move 
chrysler said it had a fourthquarter aftertax loss of 87 
million or 38 cents a share prior to the onetime restructuring 
charge 
chrysler said dec 6 it was considering selling its chrysler 
technologies corp subsidiary of which gulfstream is a part to 
raise cash and refocus on automaking 
the company has cut back excess manufacturing capacity shutting 
down its jefferson avenue assembly plant in detroit and announcing 
plans to close its st louis car assembly plant this september 
the company announced a costcutting program in october with a 
goal of cutting 1 billion from its 26billion annual budget by 
the end of this year including eliminating 2300 salaried jobs it 
since has boosted the goal to 15 billion 
iacocca called the results commendable during what he called a 
fullblown recession in the auto industry in the fourth quarter 
i am not in the least disappointed he said our cash 
position just got better and were focused 
without the cuts iacocca said we probably could have muddled 
through but we chose not to we chose to get ready for the 90s 
the countrys top two automakers general motors corp and ford 
motor co are expected to report earnings later this week gm 
reported a profit of 49 billion on revenue of 1102 billion in 
1988 and ford reported earnings of 53 billion on revenue of 
924 billion

stocks finished slightly higher on londons stock 
exchange tuesday after an erratic session marked by thin volume 
dealers said investors showed little interest in equities for 
most of the day which was dominated by worries over the direction 
of west german and british interest rates and the outlook for us 
corporate profitability and its impact on wall street 
but at midafternoon in europe stocks were pushed broadly lower 
in new york and london by news that the board of directors of the 
us investment company drexel burnham lambert inc would meet 
later tuesday to consider seeking bankruptcy protection 
however a late afternoon london rally carried london stock 
prices back into positive territory on the perception that 
drexels junk bond losses were an isolated problem 
we went from a plus to a minus said one head of market 
making in london but just as quickly the news seemed to be of 
little lasting consequence to the london market 
by the end of the european day the dow jones industrial average 
was off just 337 points at 261577 after shedding more than 20 
points at one stage 
at londons close the financial timesstock exchange 100share

the federal aviation administration today 
tentatively ordered changes in the control panels of boeing 737s to 
prevent a rudder control problem that is one focus of an accident 
hearing underway in new york 
the changes would make it less likely that pilots or cockpit 
visitors might accidentally move a rudder trim control knob that 
could reduce the pilots ability to control the plane or force an 
aborted takeoff the faa said 
the work would be relatively simple and cost about 820 per 
plane the faa said in issuing a proposed airworthiness directive 
the directive would become final after a 60day period for comment 
the order came as the national transportation safety board 
opened a fourday hearing in new york city into the sept 20 crash 
of usair flight 5050 that killed two people the plane skidded off 
the end of the laguardia airport runway into the east river and 
broke into several pieces in an aborted takeoff and investigators 
are examining a possible rudder control problem 
the faa order would cover all 737300 and 737400 models 
affecting 641 airplanes worldwide although faa orders do not 
directly apply to planes flown by foreign airlines they usually 
comply 
the alteration designed by boeing would replace a rudder trim 
knob located at the rear of a console between the two pilots and 
install a protective guardrail behind the knob to prevent it from 
being inadvertently knocked out of alignment the new knob would be 
round and fluted instead of wedgeshaped 
investigators into the crash of flight 5050 which was to take 
off for charlotte nc said the rudder was set all the way to the 
left although evidence showed that pilots made all the proper 
checks during the aborted takeoff 
the air line pilots association on monday blamed the design of 
the rudder trim control for the crash of flight 5050 
we feel the rudder trim system is what actually precipitated 
the usair accident said alpa representative tom kraemer on 
monday 
in seattle mark hooper spokesman for the boeing commercial 
airplane group said boeing had redesigned the trim switch knob 
following reports of rudder trim being changed inadvertently 
hooper said the design change adopted jan 17 was the result 
of boeing studies begun last may and subsequent reviews by the faa 
he said there had been reports of visitors in cockpits who had 
placed their feet on the aisle console and may have accidently 
turned the knob or the possibility the knob might have been jarred 
by manuals tossed on the console 
ntsb chairman james l kolstad who was conducting the new york 
hearing said that in addition to rudder control design the 
hearing would cover cockpit crew training and crew coordination 
the effects of the recent merger of usair with piedmont faa 
surveillance of usair operations and runway design

the parent of drexel burnham lambert inc plans 
to file for federal bankruptcy court protection today in a move 
that would cap the downfall of one of wall streets most powerful 
firms of the 1980s 
the decision on whether to seek protection from creditors under 
chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law was expected to be approved by 
drexels board of directors drexel officials said 
drexel chief executive frederick joseph told employees on the 
firms internal communications system that the parent company and 
certain subsidiaries would file with us bankruptcy court today 
drexel burnham lambert group inc said it had defaulted on about 
100 million in loans and a lack of cash was threatening other 
defaults 
the board meeting was scheduled to start at 4 pm edt to vote 
on whether to file for bankruptcy court protection but the drexel 
official who asked not to be named said the decision already 
appeared to have been made the official said bankruptcy papers 
were expected to be filed today 
wall street traders and other sources said drexel was barely 
functioning and was liquidating its huge portfolio of government 
securities few companies were reported to be trading with the firm 
that rose to prominence through the risky junk bonds that also have 
marked its downfall 
drexel also was said to be transferring customer accounts to 
smith barney harris upham amp co which acquired drexels retail 
brokerage business last year smith barney said it was considering 
taking over the accounts but no decision had been made 
the accounts were said to be employee or employeerelated and 
include all types of securities including stocks and bonds 
drexel today also voluntarily withdrew from making markets in 
228 stocks traded over the counter through the national association 
of securities dealers 
the firm was able to maintain its duties as a specialist on the 
floor of the new york stock exchange when another firm speer 
leeds amp kellogg agreed to clear drexel trades and guarantee their 
financial obligations drexel owns the specialist firm pforzheimer 
amp co 
drexel said in a statement that a chapter 11 filing would 
exclude the brokerdealer subsidiary drexel burnham lambert inc 
and drexel burnham government securities inc 
the statement said drexel intends to engage in an orderly 
liquidation of its positions in government securities 
drexel said monday it was seeking a major investor or merger 
partner in an effort to raise additional capital drexel blamed the 
bulk of its problems on the deteriorating market for highrisk 
highyield junk bonds that it helped to create in the 1980s 
under nowindicted executive michael milken 
drexels announcement followed several days of negotiations with 
the securities and exchange commission the federal reserve board 
and the new york stock exchange over how to prevent a financial 
panic over its troubles 
the dire problems at the investment firm threaten confidence in 
the nations financial markets because of drexels preeminence in 
the 200 billion junk bond market which has been slumping since 
last fall when several companies failed to meet financing terms on 
their junk bond debt 
the firm also was hammered by its decision to plead guilty to 
six felonies and pay 650 million to the government to settle 
federal charges related to insider trading and other offenses 
drexel was forced to restructure as part of a civil settlement with 
the sec and has cut its work force to 5300 from 10700 
in mondays statement drexel said its senior members had 
concluded it should seek outside assistance because unsettled 
markets particularly in the highyield area have adversely 
affected the liquidity of its parent 
drexel said its securities subsidiary continues to have good 
liquidity and has satisfactory excess regulatory capital 
the firm last week began to shift cash to the strapped parent 
from its securities subsidiary but the move alarmed officials at 
the fed and the sec who felt it might weaken the subsidiary 
the sec stated today in washington that it had moved to protect 
the assets of the brokerage firm by barring the subsidiary from 
transferring net capital to the parent without prior specific 
approval 
inventory schedules and other detailed financial information 
submitted by drexel burnham lambert indicate at this time the 
registered brokerdealer has positive net worth and remains in 
capital compliance the sec said 
the federal reserve bank of new york issued a statement saying 
it would carefully monitor drexels decision to liquidate its 
position in government securities in consulation with the 
government drexels securities subsidiary and other market 
participants 
the bank said drexel still was designated as a primary dealer in 
government securities 
junk bond professionals said prices of those securities were 
trading slightly higher in a chaotic morning session as rumors 
swirled around wall street on whether drexel would file for 
bankruptcy protection 
dealers in treasury securities said there was concern that by 
selling off its large portfolio drexel would add supply to the 
market and depress prices pushing interest rates higher 
you want to talk about an end of an era said joan 
greenberg a senior vice president for highyield bonds at dean 
witter reynolds inc 
analysts said drexels capital base has been reduced to a 
minimum level and that without an infusion the firm could fail to 
meet federal requirements 
led by milken who pioneered use of the lowgrade debt 
securities for multibilliondollar takeovers but left after his 
indictment last year on fraud and racketeering charges drexel was 
a symbol of the highflying takeoverdriven 1980s on wall street 
drexel reported a loss of 40 million on 41 billion in revenue 
for last year when it settled the fraud charges slashed its work 
force sold its retail brokerage business and overhauled its 
internal operations under the sec civil settlement 
the firm had made a net profit of 523 million 951 million 
before taxes on revenue of 53 billion in 1986

decided the surge might be a onetime event 
the drexel announcement came as only a small surprise to wall 
street as many traders had been aware of the investment firms

automobile sales incentives climbed 16 percent in january the 
steepest increase in more than a year the news interpreted as a 
show of economic strength at first led traders to fear the federal 
reserve would be unlikely to relax credit and allow interest rates 
to fall 
on closer inspection many traders decided the surge might be a 
onetime event but the market remained cautious 
the drexel announcement came as only a small surprise to wall 
street as many traders had been aware of the investment firms 
problems analysts said 
once investors overcame some of their uncertainty about possible 
fallout from a chapter 11 bankruptcy court filing buyers saw an 
opportunity to go back into the market the analysts said 
however there was still some concern that drexels troubles 
could affect the rest of the securities industry analysts said

chrysler corp on tuesday reported a 
664 million fourthquarter loss and a twothirds drop in annual 
earnings for 1989 mostly due to costs of closing plants and 
cutting jobs 
the results mean no profitsharing for hourly workers and no 
bonuses for salaried employees at the nations thirdlargest 
automaker chrysler chairman and chief executive officer lee a 
iacocca said 
but iacocca said the belttightening moves were needed to 
compete in a slow automotive market 
we looked at ourselves in the mirror back in may and we looked 
a little fat and we looked at the market for the early 1990s 
and it looked a little grim iacocca said 
much of chryslers first quarterly loss since 1982 was from a 
onetime restructuring charge of 577 million 
that covered costs of closing plants in detroit and st louis 
discontinuing some cars and paying pension and severance costs to 
trim the whitecollar work force the company said 
chrysler also said that to raise cash it had agreed to sell its 
gulfstream aerospace subsidiary for 825 million to a partnership 
of allen e paulson chairman and founder of the savannah 
gabased maker of corporate jets and the new york investment 
firm of forstmann little amp co 
weve got our capacity down our cash position just got a 
little better and were focused iacocca told a news conference 
it sounds like back to the basics said auto analyst mary 
anne sudol of fitch investors service in new york its a more 
vicious competitive environment for sure the race is to the 
lowestcost producer 
iacocca explained that the loss came during what he termed a 
fullblown recession in auto sales necessitating rebates of more 
than 1200 a car just to keep sales limping along 
i am not in the least disappointed he said 
the quarterly 664 million net loss equivalent to 290 a 
share compared with net earnings of 433 million or 185 a 
share in the fourth quarter of 1988 the company said 
chrysler said sales and revenues for the quarter sagged to 79 
billion from 93 billion a year earlier 
for the year the company reported net income of 359 million 
or 155 a share on revenues of 3492 billion down 66 percent 
from 105 billion or 466 a share on revenues of 3415 billion 
in 1988 
the onetime 577 million charge was partly offset by a 309 
million gain on the sale of mitsubishi motors corp stock the 
company said 
united auto workers president owen bieber and vice president 
stan marshall who directs the uaws chrysler department said they 
regretted earnings didnt trigger profitsharing for hourly workers 
under chryslers uaw contract they said in a statement at 
least there will be some equality of sacrifice and chrysler 
executives will have to go without bonuses as well 
chrysler has cut back excess capacity shutting down its 
jefferson avenue assembly plant in detroit and announcing plans to 
close its st louis car assembly plant this september 
the company also announced a costcutting program in october 
aimed at cutting 1 billion from its 26 billion annual budget by 
the end of this year including elimination of 2300 salaried jobs 
and has since boosted the costcutting goal to 15 billion 
its called restructuring to compete iacocca said we 
probably could have muddled through but we chose not to we chose 
to get ready for the 90s its all part of our plan 
the countrys top two automakers general motors corp and ford 
motor co are scheduled to report earnings thursday gm reported 
profits of 49 billion on revenues of 1102 billion in 1988 and 
ford reported earnings of 53 billion on revenues of 924 billion

goodyear tire amp rubber co despite improved 
profitability of its tire segment said tuesday its fourthquarter 
earnings dropped 74 percent from the same period in 1988 
the akronbased company attributed the lower profit to higher 
taxes on foreign earnings and a firsttime inclusion of pipeline 
expenses 
goodyear reported earnings of 147 million or 25 cents per 
share on sales of slightly more than 27 billion compared with 
earnings of 564 million 98 cents per share and sales of 28 
billion in the same period a year earlier 
for the full year goodyears earnings of 2068 million 358 
per share represented a 41 percent decline from the 1988 earnings 
of 3501 million 611 per share sales for the year virtually 
matched the 108 billion of 1988 
the companys 1990 earnings outlook was not good tom h 
barrett goodyear chairman indicated in a statement 
we expect the competitive market place and the slowdown in the 
us auto industry to continue to impact both our tire and general 
products businesses through at least the first half of 1990 
barrett said 
to meet the challenge we are working to reduce manufacturing 
and operating expenses as we continue to improve the efficiency of 
our production and distrubution operations 
barrett said that in 1989 the company incurred higher taxes on 
foreign earnings while in 1988 goodyer benefited from a tax credit 
associated with pension asset reversion 
the chairman said inclusion of depreciation and operating and 
interest expenses on its all american pipeline system reduced 
earnings in the fourth quarter by 264 million 
in the companys tire segment operating income declined 84 
percent in the fourth quarter to 1307 million despite improved 
business conditions in the united states where goodyear 
experienced lower raw materials prices and a better product mix to 
offset a 36 percent sales decline 
although the companys engineered products segment did well the 
industrial products and chemical products segments declined

a man who started smoking as a child and later 
died of lung cancer should have been warned by the american tobacco 
co that cigarettes posed a health risk before the government 
required warning labels a lawyer told a jury tuesday 
but a lawyer representing the cigarette company said the victim 
george kotler was free to stop smoking and chose to continue his 
habit 
attorneys on both sides presented their opening arguments in a 
federal lawsuit against american tobacco marking one of the rare 
smokerdeath cases to reach the courtroom 
this is not an antismoking case said garry inge who 
represents kotlers widow joanne kotler this is a warning case 
this is a case of informed consent 
we admit that if george kotler knew what american tobacco 
knew they didnt need to warn him he said 
in the last 20 years only a handful of smokerdeath lawsuits 
have made it to court as cigarette companies have spent millions 
of dollars to fight accusations of liability 
the first damages judgment came in 1988 when a federal jury in 
new jersey awarded 400000 to antonio cipollone whose wife died 
of lung cancer but an appeals court last month overturned the jury 
award and ordered a new trial 
in the boston lawsuit the case centers on kotlers smoking 
habits before 1966 when government warning labels were placed on 
cigarette packs kotler who lived in cambridge was 55 when he 
died in 1986 but he started smoking around age 11 
inge told the jury that american tobacco a subsidiary of 
american brands inc in greenwich conn had information as early 
as the 1930s indicating cigarettes posed a health risk but the 
company instead insisted that cigarette smoking was not harmful he 
said 
american tobacco put profits ahead of lives he said a 
whole generation of people could have been saved 
andrew lane representing american tobacco told the jury they 
should consider not only whether kotler had adequate information 
but also whether it would have made any difference 
lane said the controversy surrounding cigarette smoking was 
reported in the press during the 1950s and the surgeon general 
issued a highly publicized report in 1964 on the dangers of smoking 
since then millions of americans have quit smoking and thus 
have reduced their risks for lung cancer lane said but the first 
time kotler showed the slightest interest in stopping smoking 
was in 1975 when he went to see a doctor because he was suffering 
from chest pains he said 
kotler stopped smoking for several weeks but when his health 
improved he resumed smoking lane said 
he smoked because he wanted to because he liked to he said 
lane also argued that in 1968 kotler switched from the pall 
mall brand an american tobacco product and started smoking 
cigarettes made by other companies 
the suit originally named two other tobacco companies philip 
morris cos inc and liggett group inc but us district judge 
walter skinner who is presiding over the case last year ruled 
that the claims were only valid before 1966

eddie antar the crazy eddie inc founder 
sought by authorities since last week in connection with a 
government insidertrading case surrendered tuesday to face 
contempt charges for not answering demands he return 52 million to 
the united states authorities said 
us marshal arthur borinsky said antar was released pending 
court action on the contempt charge delayed until the judge 
assigned to the case returns from vacation on feb 27 
he said antars attorney jack arseneault called marshals to 
arrange the surrender at us district court here where the 
marshals have offices 
he turned himself into me borinsky said he didnt say 
where he had been and i really dont know where hes been 
antar and other top officials of the crazy eddie discount 
electronics chain were accused of insider trading in a lawsuit 
filed by the securities and exchange commission the agency charged 
that antar directed a massive financial fraud to falsify the 
companys income and reaped illegal profits through the sale of 
his stock at artificially inflated prices 
the sec won an order that 52 million be transferred from 
israeli bank accounts to a courtappointed trustee but antar has 
not yet complied with that order an sec attorney said 
us district judge nicholas h politan had ordered antar to 
repatriate the money by feb 7 but antar refused through his 
attorney citing his fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination 
politan said from the bench feb 7 that antar would have to 
appear in person if he was going to use the fifth amendment and he 
gave him until last thursday to appear in court 
on thursday antars attorneys said they needed an extension 
politan then ordered antar to appear in court on friday but antar 
again stayed away and the judge told marshals to spare no 
expense to capture antar on contempt charges 
his surrender today more or less took care of the arrest 
warrant said sec attorney richard e simpson in washington dc 
simpson said no bail was set because it was a civil case no 
other conditions have been set on antars freedom except that his 
attorneys must report on his whereabouts twice a week he said

a state judge ruled tuesday that wisconsin 
officials could collect a 5 percent sales tax from an airline for 
the drinks it sold while its jets flew over wisconsin 
dane county circuit judge james boll ordered the former republic 
airlines to pay wisconsin 90622 in overdue sales tax for drinks 
consumed on its flights over the state from 1981 to 1984 
boll rejected republics argument that a law authorizing a sales 
tax on drinks consumed in this state did not mean over this 
state 
the judge ruled the state had the right to impose its sale tax 
on flights overhead for any airline that had some definite link to 
the state such as offices based in wisconsin or incorporation 
within the state 
state officials could not be immediately reached for comment on 
whether they would seek to impose the tax on other airlines and 
seek back taxes 
republic airlines which was purchased in the mid 1980s by 
northwest airlines contended that applying the state sales tax to 
flights violated the due process clause of the us constitution 
liquor consumed in overflights was not liquor consumed 
in wisconsin the airline argued 
the airline appealed an order of the wisconsin tax appeals 
commission that it owed the tax leading to the court case 
before it was bought by northwest republic maintained offices 
in wisconsin had equipment and personnel located at airports in 
the state and flew regularly scheduled flights in and out of 
wisconsin cities 
republic said it did not keep records of whether its aircraft 
were in wisconsins air space or over another state when it sold 
drinks 
attorney frederic brouner who represented republic said he did 
not know whether northwest would appeal 
brouner called wisconsins attempt to collect the tax after the 
fact was particularly onerous 
but its a very quick clean way to pick up revenue brouner 
said how many are going to be unhappy hey only the vendor and 
corporations dont vote he said 
boll said a test for determining when taxation by a state 
violated the commerce clause of the us constitution was set forth 
in a supreme court case that held a tax would be sustained if it 
was applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the 
taxing state was fairly apportioned did not discriminate against 
interstate commerce and fairly related to services provided by the 
state 
the tax department contends that the substantial nexus test 
is satisfied by the fact that republic maintains offices equipment 
and personnel in wisconsin and is incorporated in wisconsin boll 
said this court agrees

the 200 billion junk bond market survived a day 
of jitters tuesday after the nations biggest broker of highyield 
securities said it planned to seek refuge from creditors under 
federal bankruptcy law protection 
the markets resilience under the circumstances given its recent 
steep slide surprised some analysts who had predicted a free fall 
after drexel burnham lambert incs announcement monday that it was 
seeking a merger partner and needed money 
in announcing tuesday that it would seek chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection drexels parent company said it had defaulted on about 
100 million in loans and a lack of cash was threatening other 
defaults 
nonetheless mutual funds that invest in the highyield 
securities those with low credit ratings or no ratings at all 
said there was no immediate rush by investors to sell 
we expected an abovenormal reaction and there were more calls 
than usual for redemptions but by and large investors have taken it 
in stride said steve norwitz spokesman for t rowe price 
associates inc in baltimore which manages a 700 million junk 
bond fund 
fidelity investments in boston which has about 15 billion 
invested in highyield securities said it had not received any 
unusual redemption requests 
the drexel situation and problems have been so well documented 
that it hasnt come as a shock said fidelity spokeswoman tracey 
gordon besides the market is not just drexel anymore 
steve radis spokesman for kemper financial services inc in 
chicago said drexels problems had not impacted the companys 14 
billion highyield fund 
drexel hasnt been supporting the secondary market for 
highyield bonds for sometime so it shouldnt impact trading of 
highyield issues radis said 
fund representatives said that despite recent losses in the junk 
bond market they had built up cash reserves lately and did not 
expect to have to sell bonds to pay off redemptions 
market observers nevertheless predicted drexels troubles could 
be damaging for market psychology at least in the short term 
drexel pioneered the junk bond market 
quite frankly their very serious problems are likely to add 
to the skepticism with which investors currently view junk bonds 
said john lonski senior economist with moodys investors service 
prices of most highyield junk bonds slid two points or 20 per 
1000 in face amount on monday but recovered tuesday as many 
investors went bargainhunting traders said 
the highrisk highyield corporate securities market has been 
under intense pressure due to a weakening economy and an enormous 
amount of corporate debt created by the merger wave of recent years 
among immediate investor worries are that drexel would default 
or have to liquidate its own huge inventory of junk bonds which 
would put further downward pressure on prices 
the market already faces a scarcity of buyers for example many 
ailing thrifts once important buyers of junk bonds have been 
forced to get out of the junk market by federal regulators 
insurance companies also have come under pressure to divest their 
junk bond holdings 
the average weekly new issue volume has plunged 86 percent from 
the average weekly volume in 1989 according to moodys the 
average net asset value of highyield mutual funds is off 6 percent 
since the start of the year lonski said 
meanwhile prospects for junkbond defaults have risen moodys 
now projects the default rate in 1990 at 10 percent up from 6 
percent in 1989 standard amp poors forecasts a similar rate 
nevertheless many junk bond analysts believe the current slump 
reflects a temporary transition phase some contend the junk bond 
market will emerge a stronger more mature entity 
because of their high yields junk bonds have remained 
attractive to many investors despite the risk average yields now 
exceed treasury yields by nearly 7 percentage points well above 
the historical average of 4 percentage points said lonski the 
average yield on a cashpaying junk bond was 149 percent as of 
monday compared with the yield on a 10year treasury note of 837 
percent 
the depth of the problems in the junk bond market has been 
overdone said one market researcher who asked for anonymity 
news of the death of the junk bond market is premature

union carbide officials said tuesday 
they intend to sell two polysilicon plants to kamatsu electronic 
metals co ltd of tokyo 
the plants in moses lake and washougal wash employ a total of 
270 people in the two communities and had 1988 sales of about 35

workers makes polysilicon a material used in the manufacture of 
silicon wafers for computer chips and other electronics the 
washougal plant has about 50 employees footer said 
the sale is expected to ensure the longterm operation of the 
polysilicon business the companies said in a news release 
in the long term were a more viable operation with kem 
because they are a major consumer of polysilicon footer said 
all we are is a producer 
so far the two parties have signed only a letter of intent 
involving the sale the transaction must still be reviewed by the 
us and japanese governments and a final agreement must be 
reached 
the japanese buyer is an affiliate of komatsu ltd one of the 
worlds largest makers of construction equipment komatsu ltd 
employs about 4000 people at its various us affiliates 
union carbide said the sale should produce a modest aftertax 
gain for the company 
the two companies have a history of working together the 
polysilicon production at moses lake was based on technology union 
carbide obtained from kem under a 1981 licensing agreement kem is 
presently the largest customer for the polysilicon

tuesdays activity demonstrated how closely the two markets are 
tied

average 
the dow did drop in early trading falling about 19 points 
before buyers came in and pushed it up to a 5point gain by the 
close 
analysts said the dows reverse sparked a turnaround in copper 
futures which then took on a life of their own soaring into the 
close as technical buy signals were tripped 
randolph donney an analyst with the brokerage elders futures 
inc said the commerce departments report of a 16 percent rise 
in retail sales last month also supported the copper market

rallying sharply monday amid concerns about possible supply 
disruptions in south africa

with february at 41760 a troy ounce silver futures were 28 
cents to 33 cents higher with march at 5333 a troy ounce

world production of 1079 million metric tons for 198990 
sugar futures finished 27 cent to 38 cent lower with march at 
1456 cents a pound

us gasoline stocks rose by 75 million barrels last week compared 
with market expectations ranging from 1 million to 3 million 
barrels

barrels compared with market expectations for an increase of up to 
3 million barrels

gallon unleaded gasoline was 45 cent to 05 cent higher with 
march at 6042 cents a gallon 
the wheat market led a decline in grain and soybean futures on 
the chicago board of trade reflecting improved crop weather for 
winter wheat and south american soybeans and signs of 
disappointing foreign demand

in the three months ended dec 31 vs 180 million or 126 a 
share in the yearearlier quarter 
fourthquarter revenues totaled 51 billion vs 52 billion a 
year earlier a 2 percent decline that itt attributed to the

percent from 817 million or 568 a share in 1988 revenue

the states highest court refused tuesday to 
allow the federal deposit insurance corporation to sue two former 
associates of renegade international financier michele sindona for 
almost 5 million 
sindona who controlled the defunct franklin national bank of 
new york died in 1986 in an italian prison 
in a 60 decision upholding a lower court ruling the court of 
appeals said the fdic wanted the court to expand state law 
governing the financial liability of those working with possible 
debtors 
it is not for us to write such a remedy into the statute by 
judicial construction said the courts unsigned opinion 
in its suit the fdic said sindonas associates daniel porco 
and mary bosiack transferred 487 million from some nonfranklin 
stock transactions to a swiss bank account for sindona in 1975 
the fdic said it wanted the two to come up with that amount 
even though there was no allegation noted the court of appeals 
that they benefited in any way from the transfer 
im very pleased said carol roberts a lawyer representing 
porco and bosiack of the court of appeals ruling as a result of 
their friendship and association with sindona they have been put 
through the mill 
the fdic which had taken over franklin argued that because the 
money transfer took place after the fdic had begun legal action 
against sindona to recover funds from the banks failure his 
former associates should be held liable for transferring any assets 
on his behalf even those that werent connected to the bank 
the fdics legal action against sindona begun in 1974 
culminated in 1980 with a 6 million judgment against him said ira 
hyams a lawyer representing the fdic 
while a state trial judge ruled the fdic could sue porco and 
bosiack to recover the transferred money as a means of helping 
settle the 6 million judgment against sindona a midlevel state 
appeals court threw out the fdics lawsuit

allen paulson scored a 12 punch in corporate 
aviation tuesday when he acquired chrysler corps gulfstream 
aerospace subsidiary which he heads and the troubled learjet 
corp in separate deals 
paulson gained a corner on the corporate aviation market with 
gulfstreams small and mediumsize jets and the sleek and speedy 
learjets 
chryslers goal of concentrating on car and truck production was 
enhanced with the 825 million cash it received for gulfstream 
while paulsons 60 million letter of intent for learjet coincided 
with the chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of learjets corporate 
parent integrated resources inc 
the allcash gulfstream deal helped ease chryslers 664 million 
fourthquarter loss which included 577 million in writeoffs for 
auto plants it is in the process of closing it was chryslers 
first quarterly loss since 1982 
paulson remained gulfstream chairman after he sold the company 
to chrysler in 1985 for 637 million he teamed up with new 
yorkbased investors forstmann little amp co to buy back the 
company which chrysler put on the block with the rest of its 
chrysler technologies corp subsidiaries in december forstmann 
will control slight less than half of gulfstream 
paulson founded gulfstream a savannah gabased aircraft 
manufacturing company in 1978 it has about 5000 employees at 
three plants in georgia oklahoma and california 
paulson said owning gulfstream again is like having your baby 
back 
while gulfstream has been profitable analyst charles brady of 
the new york investment firm oppenheimer amp co said it was a 
luxury chrysler chose not to afford theyve got a lot of 
jointventures going here and there its nice to be liquid 
chryslers bank account was bolstered last september when it 
sold about half of its 218 percent stake in mitsubishi motors 
corp for an aftertax profit of 310 million chrysler is 
implementing a costcutting plan to pare 1 billion in expenses 
from its 26 billion annual budget by the end of this year 
the acquisition of gulfstream never made any sense said 
auto industry analyst ronald glantz of dean witter reynolds inc in 
san francisco chrysler was talking about synergy between the 
auto and aviation businesses he said there was no synergy 
chrysler still has its electrospace systems and airborne systems 
for sale both are defenseoriented companies chrysler wants to 
shed because of a slowdown in government contracting due to the 
thaw of the cold war and political changes in eastern europe 
i have no interest in the other chrysler technologies 
companies i took the crown jewels out of chrysler technologies 
paulson said at a news conference 
ford motor co also has its ford aerospace subsidiary for sale 
general motors corp has said it has no plans to sell its gm hughes 
electronics corp which includes hughes aircraft co 
glantz said a popular story when chrysler bought gulfstream was 
that chairman lee iacocca prohibited by the federal government 
from having a corporate jet during the years when chrysler was 
recovering from its near bankruptcy proved the companys recovery 
was complete by buying a jetmaker instead of a single jet 
government loan guarantees helped chrysler survive in the early 
1980s 
when learjet went on the market last august paulson suggested 
that chrysler buy it but the board rejected his idea 
the purchase of wichita kanbased learjet is expected to be 
completed within 60 days and also involves forstmann little amp 
cos financial backing 
stephen weinroth chairman of integrated said the company had 
entertained 12 serious bids for learjet 
the 60 million price is fair value in that we solicited those 
12 bids we felt it was the best alternative said weinroth 
declining to disclose if paulsons 60 million bid was the highest 
iacocca meanwhile said he was happy with the price chrysler 
received for gulfstream 
allen paulson certainly knows gulfstream and its strengths 
iacocca said 
paulson predicted gulfstream would function more efficiently 
without its association with chrysler 
chrysler stock closed at 1637 on the new york stock exchange 
down 25 cents

here is a brief rundown of developments tuesday 
in the financial crisis facing drexel burnham lambert inc 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
drexel the leading purveyor of highrisk securities known as 
junk bonds said its parent company planned to file for protection 
under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code which could give 
the company a reprieve from creditors while it attempts to 
stabilize and continue operating the company defaulted on 100 
million in loans tuesday after banks refused to give it more 
credit drexel also said a severe cash squeeze threatened to cause 
more defaults management told employees at drexels new york 
headquarters they would get paid thursday but the company couldnt 
guarantee anything thereafter 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
few on wall street believe drexel will survive many stock and 
bond traders refused to do business with drexel the companys 
marketmakers and brokers were openly soliciting jobs on the new 
york stock exchange floor the firm began liquidating positions in 
billions of dollars worth of goverment bonds mortgagebacked 
securities and other financial instruments negotiated to transfer 
customer accounts to smith barney harris upham amp co withdrew as 
a market maker in more than 200 overthecounter stocks and put 
entire business units up for sale the junk bond market showed 
surprising resilience to the drexel news and prices rose but 
market experts said the longterm implications of drexels demise 
could severely affect confidence in all financial markets and hurt 
the ability of companies to raise capital 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
besides drexels own workforce of about 5300 a broad range of 
investors including mutual funds and pension funds could feel the 
impact of drexels problems mostly via further price declines in 
the junkbond market drexels creditors which include a broad 
range of banks also could face risk the broader us economy also 
could feel the impact if a prolonged depression in the financial 
markets forces interest rates higher

prices closed mixed on wall street tuesday as 
the stock market mulled a likely chapter 11 filing by the parent of 
drexel burnham lambert inc 
stocks opened lower after the federal government announced 
robust retail sales figures for january and then took a sharp dive 
after drexel burnham lambert group inc said it might seek federal 
bankruptcy court protection for most of the investment firms 
operations 
drexel said tuesday it had defaulted on about 100 million in 
loans and a lack of cash threatened other defaults 
prices for blue chip stocks began to come back slowly as the 
market digested both developments however analysts who said 
traders remained in a negative mood predicted the market would 
turn downward within the next few days 
the dow jones industrial average rose 496 to 262410 after 
falling more than 26 points earlier in the session 
the broader market lagged the industrials declining issues 
outnumbered advancers by a margin of about 5 to 4 in nationwide 
trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 675 up 804 
down and 489 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the big board came to 14444 million 
shares up from 11839 million in the previous session 
nationwide consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including 
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the 
overthecounter market totaled 17624 million shares 
the drexel announcement came as only a small surprise to wall 
street which had been aware of the investment firms problems but 
the news cast a pall over trading as ticker services reported 
drexel developments throughout the day 
alfred e goldman an analyst with ag edwards amp sons inc in 
st louis said that during more positive times drexels problems 
would likely not have affected the market but against a backdrop 
of economic uncertainty and the markets recent losses traders 
will focus on obvious negatives he said 
analysts said investors were concerned that the rest of the 
securities industry would be hit by fallout from a drexel chapter 
11 filing 
goldman said there were no fundamental reasons for the recovery 
in blue chips most of the buying came from program traders 
bargain hunters and investors adjusting their positions he said 
after the commerce departments report that retail sales climbed 
16 percent in january wall street repeated what has become a 
familiar process in the financial markets 
the figures were first interpreted as a show of economic 
strength and tradrs sold the market lower fearing the federal 
reserve would now be unlikely to relax credit and allow interest 
rates to fall 
on closer inspection many traders decided the surge might be a 
onetime event bigname stocks like ibm came back but the overall 
market remained cautious 
ibm was one of the days few big winners picking up 2lsqb to close 
at 103 
chrysler was off to 16rsqb after announcing its fourthquarter 
results and as expected said it was selling its gulfstream 
aerospace corp for 825 million to a partnership of gulfstream 
chairman allen e paulson and the investment firm forstmann little 
amp co 
exxon was up lsqb to 47 atampt was up rsqb to 40 and usx advanced lsqb 
to 35lsqb 
as measured by wilshire associates index of more than 5000

percent in value 
the nyses composite index of all its listed common stocks rose

the captain and the first officer of an airliner 
that skidded off the end of a la guardia airport runway crossed 
signals at a crucial point just before their plane slid into the 
east river according to their testimony tuesday 
the transcript from the last moments of usair flight 5050 on 
sept 20 shows capt michael martin saying got the 
steering 
martin told the national transportation safety board he said 
youve got the steering his first officer constantine 
kleissis said he heard martin say ive got the steering 
two people died and 31 others were injured in the mishap which 
occurred on a rainswept runway late at night after long delays 
usair flight 5050 ended with the plane in several pieces just off 
the end of the runway 
both members of the crew testified that they were having trouble 
with the planes rudder prior to the accident and that rudder is a 
focus of the ntsb hearings scheduled to last four days 
boeing has since redesigned the rudder control on the 737 and 
the federal aviation administration announced tuesday it had 
ordered airlines to make that change on existing planes 
officials said the faaordered changes in the 737 control panel 
would make it less likely that pilots or cockpit visitors might 
accidentally move a rudder trim control knob that could reduce the 
pilots ability to control the plane or force an aborted takeoff 
the faa said 
the work would be relatively simple and cost about 820 per 
plane the faa said the directive would become final after a 
60day period for comment 
the faa order would affect 641 airplanes worldwide although faa 
orders do not directly apply to planes flown by foreign airlines 
they usually comply 
the air line pilots association on monday blamed the design of 
the rudder trim control for the crash of flight 5050 
we feel the rudder trim system is what actually precipitated 
the usair accident alpa representative tom kraemer said monday

uhaul international has a message for its 
smokers and couch potatoes start leading a healthier lifestyle or 
get lighter in the wallet 
starting april 1 the company will begin docking the pay of the 
obese the anorexic and the nicotineneedy by 5 per paycheck up 
to 130 per year 
employees who quit smoking or get their weight under control 
within two years will get refunds 
the idea is not to harass employees who fall into those 
categories but to save some of the companys 17 millionayear 
outlay for medical insurance and medical costs executive vice 
president harry deshong said 
what we are trying to do is encourage people to maintain a 
state of wellness i suspect its going to have a profound impact 
on the organization deshong said 
two attorneys who specialize in labor relations said the idea 
made them sick 
its ridiculous grotesque said stanley lubin you dont 
dock people for part of their pay that way pay is an agreed amount 
of money given for an agreed amount of work the company well may 
be violating its employeremployee agreement if it docks peoples 
pay 
lawyer charles santaguida said the policy was too simplistic 
many persons with weight problems such as those linked to 
diabetes for example are physically disabled santaguida said 
and addiction to nicotine is considered to be a mental disability 
under federal statutes which prohibit discrimination on the basis 
of either physical or mental disability 
santaguida predicted the company would have to change the policy 
deshong said santaguida was representing a client against uhaul 
in another labor matter 
whats he going to do say something good about us he said 
deshong said the plan was introduced companywide through an 
inhouse newsletter last week and had met almost no opposition 
there is no organized effort to oppose implementation he said 
all of our employees are stockholders in the organization and 
the medical costs are such that we all suffer our 
medicalbenefits package affects 13000 of us and yet fewer than 
150 employees comprise 80 percent of what we spend in medical 
claims deshong said 
those people and all of us need to be more 
healthconscious he said were not trying to decrease the 
amount of coverage were trying to maintain the coverage we have 
uhaul chairman edward j joe shoen was overweight and 
recently lost 23 pounds to fall within the guidelines and deshong 
said he was familiar with anorexia because of the struggle of a 
member of his immediate family 
uhaul has no policy against hiring the obese anorexic and 
smokers but deshong said the company had been testing for drug use 
by work applicants in arizona where it employes 2300 for about a 
year 
about 7 percent of the applicants either fail the urinalysis or 
dont show up for the test 
alcohol abusers arent included in the policy because of the 
difficulty in monitoring borderline cases but the company does 
recognize alcoholism as a health threat and has programs in place 
to help its workers break the addiction deshong said

the brokerdealer arm of drexel burnham lambert 
group inc is not seeking bankruptcy court protection because 
federal law bars firms that deal in securities from reorganizing 
under chapter 11 
the parent company of onetime braggart securities firm drexel 
burnham lambert inc filed for chapter 11 protection from creditors 
tuesday in what is believed to be the largest bankruptcy plunge in 
securities industry history 
under the law firms that underwrite stocks or bonds or handle 
securities transactions with the public are not eligible for 
chapter 11 where companies can attempt reorganization without fear 
of creditors claims 
brokerages can seek to liquidate their holdings under chapter 7 
of the code a move that the drexel unit has not made drexel could 
try to liquidate outside of bankruptcy court though 
it was thought by congress too difficult to have a true 
reorganization where you have customer claims for securities that 
are in the possession of the stockbroker said new york 
bankruptcy attorney richard lieb whats really needed is to 
liquidate the positions 
but lieb said it was rare for a securities firm to survive a 
bankruptcy filing by its parent i am unaware of a successful 
reorganization out of bankruptcy or by other means of a stock 
brokerage firm he said 
securities firms typically hold and use securities owned by 
other parties because firms control but dont own such assets it 
is difficult to determine who gets what in a reorganization 
instead brokerage firms that go bellyup are protected under a 
federal agency known as the securities investors protection corp 
established about 10 years ago 
the corporation appoints an independent trustee who administers 
the liquidation and a federal insurance fund to protect customers 
of an insolvent brokerage firm the fund is supported by 
contributions from securities firms 
experts compare the agency with the federal deposit insurance 
corp which protects commercial bank deposits 
typically the net proceeds of the securities on hand are pooled 
and distributed among the various holders of a securitybut since 
brokerages manage their holdings actively often there isnt enough 
of the security to go around 
in the case of the shortage the federal insurance fund can 
cover at least some of the difference bankruptcy experts said 
there have been two bankruptcy court filings by brokerage 
parents in the last year lf rothschild holdings inc whose 
subsidiary was severely damaged in the 1987 stock market crash 
sought chapter 11 protection last june 
earlier this month jt moran financial corp parent of a 
3yearold overthecounter brokerage filed amid a shortage of 
capital and a host of legal problems 
the largest near collapse was by ef hutton amp co the retail 
brokerage that faced a damaging credit downgrade after the 1987 
crash before it was resuced by what is now shearson lehman hutton 
inc 
drexels filing is believed to be the largest on record 
bankruptcy experts could come up with no other filing that would 
compare

the germanys agreed tuesday to begin 
formal talks on making the west german mark the official currency 
of east germany a move that could lay the economic foundation for 
reunification 
in ottawa the united states britain and france agreed with the 
soviet union and the two germanys on a formula to reunite the two 
states after 45 years of division 
under the twostage plan talks between east germany and west 
germany would begin soon after east germany holds its march 18 
national elections 
later the foreign ministers of the two germanys would meet with 
the foreign ministers of world war ii allies the united states 
france britain and the soviet union to discuss security 
questions 
the soviets want a neutral germany while the united states is 
pressing for nato membership 
the agreement was reached at an eastwest meeting on aerial 
surveillance 
deep problems meanwhile still exist between the government of 
west german chancellor helmut kohl and the rickety communist 
coalition of east german premier hans modrow 
we still have a difficult stretch of road ahead of us before 
fulfilment of german unity kohl told reporters after his meeting 
with modrow 
their brief summit produced an agreement to set up a joint 
commission to devise a way how to make the west german mark the 
official currency of both nations 
although the commission which is to begin talks next week will 
deal with an important component of reunification any system it 
comes up with would not be put into effect until after modrows 
lameduck government is succeeded in march 
the opposition groups want all important decisions on economic 
recovery put off until after march 18 
but some west german officials who are championing reunification 
warn that east germanys economic state is so dire that it could be 
bankrupt even before the elections kohl said more than 85000 east 
germans have fled to west germany during the past six weeks 
the west german chancellor proposed monetary union a week ago as 
a means of giving east germans confidence of immediate relief 
but expansion of the mark into east germany would demand 
complete conversion to a market economy and would effectively deed 
economic control to west germanys central bank 
modrow pressed for immediate steps after march 18 to join the 
german economies but made clear that no action could be taken 
before then 
the premier instead appealed for 9 billion in solidarity 
aid to tide over east germany west german finance minister theo 
waigel said massive loans could not be made when so little detail 
of east germanys financial profile has been made public 
modrow claimed his nation has much to contribute to a unified 
germany declaring that national wealth totals 850 billion more 
than half the gross national product of the wealthy west german 
state that is three times larger 
that statistic illustrated the difficulty western officials have 
in translating socialist valuations in nonconvertible currency 
into assessments of comparable worth in hard currency 
in addition to bonns uncertainties over east germanys 
financial state the kohl government is reluctant to provide aid to 
the modrow government that is virtually assured of being ousted in 
the elections 
the communists are widely distrusted because of the corruption 
that was rampant under former leader erich honecker who was ousted 
last year 
west german political parties are aiding the new disorganized 
and diverse groups campaigning for parliamentary seats in east 
germany but the western parties singling out the most compatible 
east german parties are mainly interested in having a ready power 
base in the east once unification takes place 
west germanys opposition social democrats contend that kohls 
conservativeled government has deliberately overstated the east 
german economic crisis in order to pressure the soviet union and 
the other world war ii victor powers into supporting reunification 
kohl who hopes to use the reunification issue to boost his own 
popularity won assurances from kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev 
during a weekend summit in moscow that the soviets would respect 
germans desire to live as one nation 
social democratic party leader hansjochen vogel denounced 
kohls chief foreign policy adviser horst teltschik for telling 
reporters prior to the moscow trip that east germany could be 
insolvent within a few days 
modrow spokesman wolfgang meyer denied east germany was on the 
brink of bankruptcy and the stir created by teltschiks forecast 
appeared to put a wedge between kohl and modrow
