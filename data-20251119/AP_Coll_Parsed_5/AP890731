the senate voted unanimously on monday to 
condemn the apparent execution of kidnapped marine lt col william 
higgins as an outrageous act of terrorism and urged president 
bush to consider retaliation if possible 
the vote on the amendment sponsored by senate majority leader 
george mitchell of maine and senate republican leader bob dole of 
kansas was 990 sen spark matsunaga dhawaii is ill and did not 
vote 
the united states must take the lead in bringing to an end 
what has become an international scourge mitchell said 
immediately before the senate voted 
all nations must act he said if an end is to be put to 
terrorism those nations must consult coordinate and act 
fainthearted efforts and half steps only embolden 
terrorists mitchell said the united states must not shrink 
from pursuing every effort to ensure the american people are free 
from what is now the possible danger of attack when overseas 
dole who earlier had crticized israel for not informing the 
united states before seizing suspected terrorists a step that 
allegedly led to higgins reported killing made clear his mind had 
not been changed 
he said that beyond sending a message to terrorist groups and to 
nations like iran suspected of being a driving force behind them 
we also want to send a message to our friends 
the message this is a very serious matter and we believe that 
in any future efforts there should be some notification some 
coordination and maybe more responsibility assumed by our 
friends 
outside the capitol the antidefamation league of bnai brith 
said it was shocked by doles remarks because they failed to 
place the blame for col higgins murder where it truly belongs 
with iran and the hezbollah terrorists 
we must support each other directing our efforts against 
those responsible for the evil of terrorism said a statement 
from burron s levinon chairman and abraham h foxman national 
director 
the national association of arabamericans said it condemned 
those responsble for col higgins execution which it called 
reprehensible but said it supported doles remarks and 
believed israeli leaders knew their kidnapping of a hezbollah 
leader would set off a cuycle of violence and retribution 
the journalists committee to free terry anderson the 
associated press correspondent who is the longestheld hostage 
said in a message to bush and members of congress it was gravely 
concerned about us reaction as terrys sister peggy say said 
today this is no time for revenge violence only begets violence 
we urge you to use restraint and explore all avenues of peaceful 
discussions with iran 
the senate resolution condemned higgins reported death as 
barbaric cowardly and utterly imcompatible with the standards 
of conduct upheld by civilized people 
the president should utilize all available resources of the 
united states government to determine the responsibility of 
those responsible it said 
the president should determine whether it would be possible to 
isolate and bring to justice or retaliate against those responsible 
in a manner that would reduce the risk to americans from 
terrorism the nonbinding resolution said 
and it said the president should urgently consult israel and 
other governments concerning their policies and actions which 
might have relevance to the interests of the united states or 
increase the vulnerability of us citizens to attacks by 
terrorists 
other congressional reaction to the reported execution of an 
american hostage ranged from calls for revenge to warnings that 
such moves would only worsen conditions in the volatile middle east 
we cant blow lebanon up simply to avenge the life of one 
american said rep dante fascell dfla chairman of the house 
foreign affairs committee 
house minority leader robert michel rill said no cause or 
political goal can be used to justify such a despicable cowardly 
act 
as for options were back to square one said sen richard 
lugar rind a senior member of the senate foreign relations 
committee its a horrible mess 
foreign relations committee chairman claiborne pell dri 
called the reported execution a dreadful horrible devastating 
action i know the president is as horrified as we are this will 
be discussed at the highest levels and i am sure we will be 
cooperating with the executive branch 
rep william broomfield of michigan the senior republican on 
the house foreign affairs committee lamented that with every 
passing year it seems that some areas of the islamic world are 
moving farther and farther away from the orbit of civilized 
nations 
others were more blunt rep george gekas rpa said we need 
revenge and we need justice and i will support the president in 
whatever means he might employ to bring them about 
rep robert lagomarsino rcalif added the president should 
do everything he thinks is necessary to avenge this killing and i 
mean he should consider every possible retaliatory action 
sen mitch mcconnell rky asked bush in a letter to award 
higgins the medal of honor 
this tribute is customarily issued to soldiers who prove valor 
in military actions or in peacetime demonstrate unique acts of 
bravery mcconnell told the senate 
i think richs record is clear he said his selfless 
efforts to secure peace in a nation consumed by bloodshed and 
battle should be recognized and honored higgins was born in 
danville ky

federal scientists have taught cows to avoid 
eating a poisonous plant but the cattle act more like lemmings 
when gripped by the psychology of the herd 
in newly reported studies cows that learned to avoid the tall 
larkspur did fine when they grazed by themselves but they started 
to eat it when they mingled in the pasture with untrained animals 
that were enjoying the tasty plant which has caused serious losses 
in some western herds 
the peer pressure appears to be very very strong said 
range scientist michael ralphs 
there may be ways to fight it said ralphs of the federal 
agricultural research services poisonous plant research laboratory 
in logan utah 
the training approach may also help with other problem plants 
such as locoweed he said 
he spoke in a telephone interview before presenting the work at 
the third international symposium on poisonous plants which 
concluded saturday in logan 
the tall larkspur may kill more than 2000 cows a year on 
highaltitude summer pastures in colorado idaho montana nevada 
utah and wyoming ralphs said ranchers can lose up to 10 percent 
of their herds he said 
cattle relish the plant which resembles the garden delphinium 
said study coauthor john d olsen 
ranchers build fences or spray herbicides to fight the problem 
both expensive strategies ralphs said sometimes they pass up the 
chance to graze cattle on lush grass and other nutritious plants in 
larkspurinfested pastures 
the new work is designed to make cattle associate the taste of 
tall larkspur with feeling ill after eating small safe doses of 
larkspur cattle were made to feel nauseous by infusion of a 
chemical through a tube to their stomachs 
ralphs said the training made five oneyearold heifers avoid 
the plant when turned loose in a small rangeland plot when they 
returned the year after training the aversion persisted 
but when they were allowed to mingle with untrained cattle that 
ate larkspur the trained cows started eating it too 
apparently if they observe another animal eating it theyre 
tempted to try it olsen said and if they eat it then without 
any ill consequence then the taste aversion is lost or at least 
reduced 
to overcome this peer pressure researchers tried another 
experiment with five pairs of cattle one member of each pair was 
trained and then it and its partner were offered small doses of 
larkspur when the trained animal started eating it got another 
dose of the nauseainducing chemical 
they must learn that even though my neighbor does i must 
avoid it ralphs explained 
this summer researchers plan to see if cows already familiar 
with the pastureland can be trained to resist the peer pressure 
there another approach may be to train young animals and keep them 
separate from larkspureating cows for a year or so until their 
feeding patterns are set ralphs said 
scientists still must find a way to make the training procedure 
practical for ranches he said

cold fusion researcher stanley pons has 
given up trying to convince critics that he and colleague martin 
fleischmann may have unlocked the power of the sun in a laboratory 
beaker 
but if many physicists have ridiculed the notion of tabletop 
roomtemperature fusion its become a boom industry in utah where 
the two chemists enjoy strong support 
pons university of utah has leased a research center and a utah 
congressman is preparing a bill to create a national center here a 
private group of boosters has been created to help pons and 
fleischmann win over nonbelievers 
pons said months of stinging criticism have taken their toll 
leaving him frustrated and weary of meetings with skeptical and 
sometimes hostile colleagues 
its a bit depressing to say the least he said last week 
theyre saying it cant be done but they cant explain our 
results 
pons may have given up on the critics but neither he nor the 
university is about to give up on cold fusion 
bolstered by 45 million in state funds the university has 
signed a lease for an offcampus fusion research center and pons 
and fleischmann are writing a new paper expanding the theory behind 
their experiments 
when you know youre right its a lot easier to move ahead we 
know the science is there said james brophy the universitys 
vice president for research with this beginning of seed money 
and with corporate support well define what the possibilities 
are 
brophy said negotiations are under way with general electric 
which has agreed to collaborate with the two scientists he would 
not provide further details 
gov norm bangerter the state legislature and the congressional 
delegation are firmly behind pons and fleischmann of britains 
university of southampton a bill by democratic rep wayne owens 
would create a national fusion research center at the university 
which is in his district the bills chances were hurt by a july 12 
report by the us energy departments energy research advisory 
board which concluded there was no convincing evidence that cold 
fusion works 
pons and fleischmann startled scientists with their march 23 
announcement that they had sustained a fusion reaction by running 
an electrical current between electrodes of palladium and platinum 
immersed in heavy water so called because instead of normal 
hydrogen it contains the heavier isotope deuterium 
pons said the process had produced more than 50 times the amount 
of energy that went into it if true it could lead to technology 
that would provide the world with an unlimited relatively clean 
supply of energy 
fusion involves the combining of atoms and should be safer than 
fission atomsplitting which has been used to produce nuclear 
power 
initial excitement among scientists turned to ire as major 
laboratories were unable to duplicate the process the two 
scientists were openly ridiculed during the annual meeting of the 
american physical society in baltimore in april 
pons said the laboratories that could not achieve fusion hadnt 
done their experiments right adding that he was frustrated by 
scientists who dismissed his findings without providing details of 
their own methodology 
they just say it didnt work and walk away they dont publish 
anything said pons who himself was criticized for announcing 
his findings rather than publishing details of the research 
it is tremendously frustrating it puts you on your knees 
because you dont have any idea what theyre doing they dont give 
you the opportunity you made a mistake if you say you saw heat if 
you see tritium youre insane 
radioactive tritium another isotope of hyodrogen can only be 
produced in a fusion reaction pons claimed tritium was created 
during his experiment about a dozen labs around the world also 
have reported finding tritium in their fusion experiments among 
them was the los alamos national laboratory which did not confirm 
that the experiment produced fusion 
pons said many scientists who have achieved fusion are holding 
back their results for fear of public humiliation 
a new private organization the fusion information center has 
started an education campaign aimed at convincing the world that 
pons and fleischmann are right 
i like to tell people its the most important discovery since 
adams rib said hal fox a retired missile systems engineer who 
is funding the group and is its president

federal housing officials say they are 
reviewing two contracts approved by samuel pierce in his final days 
as housing secretary and agency sources say pierce endorsed one 
project over stiff objections from hud experts 
the two contracts worth several hundred thousand dollars were 
placed on hold shortly after the jan 20 change in administrations 
ended pierces eightyear tenure at the department of housing and 
urban development 
one contract was to go to a firm headed by two prominent black 
republicans and the other to a company whose president had a 
longstanding friendship with a former pierce deputy hud officials 
said the officials asked that they not be identified by name 
pierces role in these contracts came to the attention of hud 
investigators about two weeks ago the hud sources said 
hud spokesman jack flynn asked about the january approvals 
confirmed that they were among a number of pending contracts put on 
hold after jack kemp succeeded pierce as hud secretary 
several department sources said hud staffers had questioned the 
need for the consulting arrangements and had criticized the 
proposals as poorly drafted 
the contracts were issued under a technical assistance program 
that hud auditors have criticized on grounds that many contractors 
provided too few services and spent too much money on overhead and 
administrative costs 
pierces approval of the projects was not improper but his role 
is at odds with his congressional testimony in sworn testimony in 
may he told congress he took no direct role in agency funding 
decisions 
repeated attempts to reach pierce in recent weeks have been 
unsuccessful he has an unlisted home telephone number and has not 
returned messages left at his former law office in new york 
one contract to a company called one america inc was endorsed 
by pierce on jan 17 three days before he left the department 
according to hud sources who said an agency selection committee 
voted 61 against the contract 
the other contract to mississippibased promark inc also was 
approved by pierce in midjanuary according to sources who said 
the proposal was extensively revised before the review committee 
approved it by a 53 margin 
the presidents of both companies defend their proposal both of 
which dealt with minority enterprise 
one america is headed by elaine b jenkins who once served on a 
white house small business commission and her husband howard 
jenkins a former labor department official and the first black to 
serve on the national labor relations board 
promark president les range has close ties to dubois gilliam a 
former pierce associate who approved earlier hud contracts to the 
company before he left the agency range said he appealed to pierce 
in the belief that criticisms of promarks previous work may have 
been racially motivated 
the housing agency during pierces tenure became a wellspring of 
cash for wellconnected developers and consultants and a stunning 
example of mismanagement that allowed millions of dollars to 
disappear through sloppy accounting practices 
one america requested 421000 to develop a computerized listing 
of black entrepreneurs pierce approved the project at half that 
amount despite the committees recommendation to reject the 
unsolicited proposal 
hud records indicate that one america based in silver spring 
md has received four contracts worth more than 15 million from 
the technical assistance program since 1981 the company once 
shared an office and telephone number with the council of 100 a 
black republican group at the time mrs jenkins was the groups 
chairwoman 
in a telephone interview friday mrs jenkins said one america 
has barely broken even on its hud contracts and defended its 
work as essential aid to small and minorityowned businesses with 
little experience in dealing with the federal bureaucracy 
mrs jenkins said she does not know pierce and played down her 
political connections 
being a republican has not yet been ruled illegal she said 
neither has being a black republican she also dismissed the 
timing of pierces approval which came just three days before the 
change of administrations in january 
promark is a jackson miss company that from 1985 through 
1988 received 400000 from hud to provide technical advice on hud 
programs to small and minorityowned business in the state of 
mississippi 
initial funding for promark was approved by gilliam a former 
hud deputy assistant secretary whose duties included oversight of 
the technical assistance program gilliam was indicted in april 
for allegedly seeking to defraud the government in 1986 by making 
money off a mississippi project he had funded with hud money 
promark requested 240500 to continue its hud contract this 
year pierce approved the contract at 150000 but kemp aides have 
shipped the proposal back to huds atlanta regional office because 
of questions raised by current hud officials 
pierce has been recalled by the congressional subcommittee he 
appeared before in may and is scheduled to testify sept 15 and at 
least once more after that 
since his earlier testimony evidence of his involvement in 
certain hud projects has surfaced 
a former agency official told congressional investigators she 
was ordered by pierce to fund a durham nc project supported by 
the citys thenmayor charles markham a former law partner of 
pierces 
and files kept by deborah gore dean who for three years was 
pierces top aide indicate pierce also took a personal role in 
projects involving jazz musician lionel hampton and former gop sen 
edward brooke

house ethics committee chairman julian dixon 
is disputing a law firms statement that it contacted him several 
times in 1986 and 1987 to lobby for a company with which his wife 
now has a lucrative deal 
the washington law firm that represents duty free shoppers group 
ltd told justices office of foreign agents registration that it 
talked with dixon three times and bought him dinner once in the 
course of its work for the client 
but dixon in written responses to questions about the meetings 
said the documents filed by the law firm contain erroneous 
information 
at no time have i ever been lobbied or have i ever engaged 
in any discussion whatsoever concerning duty free shoppers the 
california democrats response said i have never helped duty 
free shoppers with their legislation and i do not know if any 
exists 
betty dixon dixons wife has a lucrative stake in a joint 
venture with duty free shoppers the majority partner in a group 
that operates stores at the los angeles international airport 
dixon said the documents contain wrong information because he 
never talked about duty free shoppers with ronald brown the 
attorney that represented the san franciscobased company brown 
now the chairman of the democratic national committee worked for 
patton boggs amp blow 
the law firm was paid at least 14 million over four years by 
duty free shoppers to pursue the companys legislative goals 
in connection with its representation of duty free shoppers 
patton boggs amp blow has had contacts with congressman dixon and 
other members of congress the firm said in a statement 
brown did not return telephone calls but patton boggs 
reaffirmed the information in the justice reports 
the dixons earned more than 150000 in dividends in two years 
from the airport operation after investing between 5000 and 
15000 according to dixons financial disclosure statements in 
addition mrs dixons stake in the company has grown in value to 
at least 100000 
patton boggs reported to justice that it contacted dixon three 
times in early 1986 before mrs dixon invested in the airport 
concession and once in 1987 mrs dixon invested in the 
partnership in july 1986 three months after the airport board 
awarded the concession 
here are the dixon contacts listed in the documents 
on march 11 1986 duty free shoppers picked up a 187 dinner 
tab for dixon and johnnie l cochran jr a member of the los 
angeles airport board cochran was a consultant to the ethics 
committee at the time 
dixon said the dinner bill for himself brown cochran and a 
friend jay preston johnson was mistakenly paid by duty free 
shoppers 
ron has told me dfs was billed due to a processing error he 
said it was not a business dinner by any stretch of the 
imagination and absolutely no conversation regarding dfs or the 
la airport occurred 
the foursome gathered to talk about cameroon an african nation 
where johnson served with the agency for international development 
dixon said 
on feb 26 1986 and the next day patton boggs had 
conferences personal and telephonic with the following julian 
dixon the reports said the subject of the contacts involved 
advice that patton boggs gave to duty free shoppers concerning 
its duty free stores in several cities including los angeles 
the reports said 
dixon said the feb 26 event was a patton boggs social 
function at which his wife not he had a brief conversation 
about duty free shoppers mrs dixon apparently learned about the 
duty free shoppers investment possibility at the event dixon 
said 
of the feb 27 contact dixon said i have no recollection of 
such a contact or with ron brown finally i am informed that mr 
browns secretary at patton boggs has no reference to a contact 
with me in her records thus i am at a loss to explain or respond 
to the feb 27 1986 reference 
on sept 26 1987 patton boggs contacted dixon in 
connection with the regulation of duty free shops by the customs 
service the documents say dixon said he attended a 
congressional black caucus foundation function that day 
why a report of dfsoriented contact has been made is a matter 
i cannot explain i was not lobbied by any person or organization 
during that function he said 
patton boggs is required to file foreign agents disclosure forms 
every six months on its work for duty free shoppers which is 
headquartered in san francisco but incorporated in bermuda 
mrs dixon who has a background in retailing has a 12 percent 
interest in two minorityowned companies that were formed to be 
duty free shoppers partners in the los angeles airport concession

the philippines with its 30 billion debt 
may be the next country to get help from banks under pressure to 
help the third world climb out of poverty international finance 
sources say 
mexico got first attention under treasury secretary nicholas f 
bradys debtreduction plan that countrys annual debt payments 
could be reduced by as much as 3 billion under a financial package 
announced july 23 
brazil and argentina owe a lot more than the philippines 120 
billion and 60 billion but sources say they will have to wait 
the new argentine government of president carlos menem is still 
settling in and brazil will have an election in november 
another candidate for early help is venezuela where president 
carlos andres perez wants his countrys 35 billion debt cut in 
half there has been pressure for action on venezuela because of 
bloody riots in february caused by austerity measures taken by the 
government to help meet its payments 
it is uncertain how much can be done for the philippines as it 
is for mexico despite the plan to reduce that countrys 54 billion 
debt the success of the mexico plan depends on bankers 
willingness to participate experts say 
now the arrangement has been agreed for mexico therell be a 
question of reducing debt and interest for the philippines too 
said a banker who spoke on condition of anonymity 
much will depend on how much pressure the bush administration 
exerts on banks to work out an agreement with the philippines as 
it did on the mexico debt problem the banker said 
one calculation is that the philippines needs 17 billion in 
new money over the next two years 
for the philippines one expert who also spoke on condition of 
anonymity predicted that an accord could be reached by the end of 
august between that countrys government and a committee of 12 
banks led by manufacturers hanover trust co a meeting is due in 
new york by midaugust 
however haywood fleisig in charge of philippine affairs at the 
world bank said any action by commercial bankers would affect only 
about 75 billion of that countrys debt 
individual governments to which the philippines also owe money 
have already granted some relief in may the governments put off 
for six years any repayment of principal and threequarters of the 
interest on 185 billion due them 
incomes in the philippines as in many african and latin 
american countries have declined during much of the 1980s 
president corazon aquino said last week the philippine situation 
is getting better although 500000 people have crossed the poverty 
line since she took office three years ago the average filipino 
earned about 590 in 1987 according to the world bank 
venezuela has long been a richer country than either mexico or 
the philippines because of its oil resources nearly all its 
borrowing has been from commercial banks rather than from 
governments or official bodies 
but a committee of bankers chaired by chase manhattan corp 
refused venezuelas debtreduction proposal last week and more 
meetings are due in august 
the average venezuelans income was 3230 in 1987 the drop in 
the price of oil had brought that down from the 4920 of 1982 
another country that could get help from the bankers is costa 
rica said richard e feinberg vice president of the overseas 
development council a private study group on third world problems 
costa rica owes about 45 billion much less than the 
philippines and venezuela but costa rica is a much smaller country 
and the world bank calculates the debt burden on the average 
citizen is higher than that on the average filipino or mexican

farmerowned cooperatives are showing healthy 
signs again after suffering financial setbacks during the early and 
mid1980s according to an agriculture department report 
preliminary figures for 50 of the nations 100 largest farm 
cooperatives show that total revenues in 1988 despite drought 
rose by 9 percent and that profits or net margins were up 28 
percent from 1987 
michael d kane an economist for the departments agricultural 
cooperative service said also that coops last year showed a 
significant 6 percent decline in longterm debt and put greater 
reliance on cooperative bank financing 
in somewhat dramatic fashion farmer cooperatives continued 
their recovery from the agricultural recession of the 1980s kane 
writes in the current issue of farmer cooperatives magazine 
the 9 percent growth business last year pushed estimated total 
revenues of the top 100 coops to nearly 469 billion but that 
was still far short of the record level of around 58 billion set 
in 1981 before the slump began 
droughtinduced higher commodity prices brought greater 
marketing revenues on reduced volume while farm supply sales and 
volume also improved kane said 
marketing coops those that handle grain and other commodities 
for farmers had sales estimated at more than 33 billion up 6 
percent from 1987 
most farm supply cooperatives report growth in overall sales 
particularly fertilizer he said fertilizer sales among the 
top 100 are estimated to increase more than 900 million in 1988 
because higher domestic and export tonnage drove up total dollar 
sales 
looking at profit sheets kane said net margins to the top 100 
coops last year were estimated at more than 920 million 
accounting for the 28 percent increase from 7173 million in 1987 
net margins would have topped the billiondollar mark except 
for major losses in petroleum refinery operations he said 
regardless net margins are expected to reach their highest level 
since 1980

its okay to clean up the environment just 
dont do it at the expense of hungry people says orville l 
freeman president of the agriculture council of america 
there is danger that these needs of the hungry will be 
obscured while the affluent 10 percent of the world looks for a 
broad brush and quick fix to environmental problems that have been 
decades in the making he said at a recent conference on future 
global problems 
in our haste to atone for environmental sins of the past we 
must not delude ourselves about the realities of the future 
freeman said we must guide the world to a technology that meets 
the need of both humanity and the environment 
the council is a private nonprofit organization based in 
washington it represents all segments of agriculture and 
frequently concentrates on trade and world issues that affect 
american farmers and consumers 
freeman a former governor of minnesota was secretary of 
agriculture during the 1960s in the kennedy and johnson 
administrations 
the estimated population growth for the next quartercentury 
is so enormous that warning bells should be sounding in every 
quadrant of the globe freeman said feeding this population 
may very well be the greatest challenge we have ever faced one 
that will test the worlds productive and technological 
capabilities to their very limits 
freeman said that projections show the worlds population will 
increase by more than 1 billion people to 62 billion by the turn 
of the century and to nearly 11 billion by 2050

japanese farmers are finding it cheaper to 
import hay and other forage than to grow it themselves 
a report by the agriculture department says japans strong yen 
is a major reason that forage imports are so cheap 
in addition japanese farmers are importing higher quality 
forages in an effort to increase the fat content of their fluid 
milk production the report in the departments foreign 
agriculture magazine said a new support price mechanism requires 
higher fat content in milk for qualification of support payments 
finally it said there is less rice straw available because of 
japans rice land diversion program and rainy weather has reduced 
domestic roughage supplies

violinist eugene fodor jr whose intensity and 
talent won him early rewards at the white house and in moscow has 
landed in jail on charges that relatives said stemmed from a drug 
problem 
fodor 39 was being held on cocaine trafficking cocaine and 
heroin possession and breakingandentering charges after a judge 
refused to accept his offer of a 300yearold violin to guarantee 
bail instead the judge friday set 50000 cash bail 
on thursday chambermaids at a marthas vineyard hotel found him 
in a room that was supposed to be empty and called police who said 
they found 20 grams of cocaine heroin a hypodermic needle and a 
dagger in fodors possession 
fodors father said he had no warning that his son was in 
trouble 
the first i knew about it was when i read todays paper 
eugene fodor sr of morrison colo said saturday he planned 
today to travel to edgartown where his son was jailed 
fodor was vacationing on marthas vineyard when he was arrested 
at the vineyard harbor hotel 
a family member in new york who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said sunday the arrest likely stems from fodors drug use which 
she said may be rooted in the same intensity that fires his musical 
creativity 
the only explanation i can think of is that he does everything 
in a thorough way she said hes a genius in his work and he 
devotes all his energy to his work hes very intense in whatever 
he does 
fodor who was born in denver and lives in new york city began 
playing the violin at age 8 he made his debut as a young soloist 
with the denver symphony he has performed at the white house at 
carnegie hall in new york in moscow where in 1974 he became the 
first american winner of the tchaikovsky violin competition at the 
paganini international violin competition in genoa italy and most 
recently in concert halls in south america 
but some colleagues said fodor had not performed as often in 
recent years and critics said he never reached the top ranks of 
virtuosos 
the violinists exwife susan davis of vienna va said she 
was stunned to learn of his arrest and his attempt to use the 
violin as surety for bond 
davis said fodor called her early friday and sounded frightened 
she said his managers have not guided him properly 
hes a very serious musician but when he came back from 
moscow they billed him as the mick jagger of classical music 
she said 
the family member in new york said fodor became involved in 
drugs relatively recently out of nowhere she said fodors 
career had been going well in recent months 
she added that fodor has plenty of money so it was unclear 
why he would need a free place to sleep or to offer his violin for 
bail 
fodor also was charged with possession of a hypodermic needle 
and possession of a dangerous weapon a dagger

sherrie l hassenger was working in her yard 
in tiny birkenfeld ore when the telephone call came from 
randolph air force base in texas last june 8 
the air force told her of a report from laos that her husband 
arden k hassenger may have been seen hassenger now 53 was lost 
over laos on christmas eve 1965 during an armed reconnaissance 
flight 
they just told me there was a possible sighting she said 
friday at the annual convention of the national league of families 
of american prisoners and missing in action in southeast asia 
its telling me that theres a possibility that he is alive 
she said fighting back tears and i have a lot more hope its 
information that i would rather have than some people that are 
getting a box of bones a tooth or whatever the remains im 
thankful for the information 
it was the first clue to her husbands whereabouts since he was 
lost along with five other crew members a followup letter june 12 
said the report included information taken from dog tags 
the dog tags carry military personnels serial numbers 
religious affiliation and residence 
as a result of the call and letter mrs hassenger decided to 
attend her first convention in 12 years she went for support in 
her quest for information to make contact with relatives of other 
crew members and to find renewed solidarity after years of 
wondering in isolation 
well theyve always told me that they would take care of it 
the air force she said and i live so far away from everyone 
i just didnt have the tactics or the knowhow i didnt know that 
i was supposed to keep calling harassing what i was supposed to 
do to get information but now i have friends that are going to 
help me 
chief master sgt hassenger is one of 2348 americans still held 
prisoner missing or unaccounted for in southeast asia the number 
includes 42 civilians two of whom are women according to pentagon 
figures supplied by the league of those 1714 are believed to be 
in vietnam 
as of july 3 this year there have been 1210 firsthand live 
sighting reports in indochina since 1975 the league says again 
using pentagon figures of those reports 1078 have been resolved 
including 805 who have since left indochina and 273 were 
fabrications 
there are 70 socalled discrepancy cases highpriority 
cases in which americans have been reportedly seen as prisoners 
hassenger according to a defense intelligence agency message was 
reportedly unable to leave laos 
since 1973 235 sets of remains have returned the bulk of those 
in the last nine years 
congressmen and members of the bush administration who addressed 
the convention told the families the missing servicemen are a 
frontburner issue but that much depends on the vagaries of 
politics in vietnam laos and cambodia 
the fullest possible accounting remains a matter of highest 
national priority bush told the group bush said he has asked 
secretary of state james a baker iii to raise the issue this week 
during an international conference on the future of cambodia 
over the past year there has been progress in dealing with 
hanoi a series of technical meetings and investigations more 
remains returned from vietnam 
but the frustration is growing among family members 
i think theyre dragging their feet and pretty soon theyll be 
dead and then we dont have an issue do we said lorene walker 
61 of rapid city sd her son bruce has been missing for 17 
years 
bruce walkers father charles 63 expressed impatience with 
the administration and members of congress for relying on the 
indochinese governments 
as an alternative to directly confronting the vietnamese the 
cia must be good for something he said you go find out for 
sure what exactly is happening in a country we do it every place 
else i dont know why weve pulled everybody out of vietnam

president bush says hes not too happy with 
the way things are turning out between himself and congress but 
then nobody ever said it would be easy 
bushs resigned commentary came as he emerged from a rough 
stretch that saw his policy positions from military spending to 
savings and loan bailout undergo a trouncing on capitol hill 
i would not give congress very high marks on doing what i want 
done on legislation bush told reporters in a news conference 
friday when he was asked to rate his legislative success 
but in keeping with his repeated comments about wanting to work 
harmoniously with the democraticcontrolled congress bush said he 
would not get into personal criticism 
i have to work with these people the president said i 
have never been too hot at being a namecaller 
after spewing anticongress rhetoric with gusto during his 
presidential campaign last year bush launched his presidency with 
an inaugural address calling for a bipartisan working spirit 
between the white house and congress the american people do not 
want to see their leaders bickering the new president said 
but democrats now say such conciliatory language belies an 
unsettling pattern in which bush takes the high road while his 
aides and republican allies undermine legislative agreements 
bush wants kinder and gentler while his people are gnawing 
your legs off said rep byron dorgan dnd 
the president has encountered several rough patches recently on 
capitol hill 
last thursday the house scrambled the administrations defense 
spending priorities by slashing key weapons systems bush wants and 
adding money for others that he wants to cut out 
also last week house and senate negotiators agreed on a savings 
and loan bailout plan but dealt bush a setback by rejecting a 
funding mechanism he sought to keep the billions of bailout dollars 
out of the federal budget 
bush complained congress has dragged its feet on the bailout he 
sent his plan to the lawmakers in february with a request for 
urgent action within 60 days after more than five months the 
package heads to the senate floor this week 
on another front lawmakers are moving ahead with legislation 
against flagdesecration in lieu of the constitutional amendment 
that bush favors the house judiciary committee last week blocked 
consideration of a constitutional amendment and passed the 
legislative approach 
in addition several of bushs administration nominees are 
getting a harsh reception in confirmation hearings several 
ambassadorial nominees have been criticized as unqualified and 
bushs choice to head the justice departments civil rights 
division william lucas is up against strong opposition 
some lawmakers criticize bush for making expensive legislative 
promises such as his call for missions to the moon and mars and 
leaving congress to figure out how to pay for them 
i think the president is going to find his good will here is 
going to diminish said rep sander levin dmich 
still the president voices a desire for compromise and 
negotiation 
he said friday that if he cant get the capital gains tax cut he 
wants lets see what can be worked out 
if there is some compromise that can spur investment spur 
jobs increase employment because of new jobs starting up id be 
interested in it he said 
and he did not specifically say he would veto a bill outlawing 
desecration of the flag although didnt say he would sign it 
either 
but the president is skating on thin ice with many democrats who 
say the administration is talking out of both sides of its mouth 
more than 80 democrats cried foul in a letter to bush on friday 
saying the national republican congressional committee issued news 
releases blasting more than 20 of them for voting last month to 
support the presidents position against random drug testing for 
state department employees 
house minority leader robert michel rill acknowledged that 
white house chief of staff john sununu is in on a strategy to 
develop the wedge issues such as the flag to put democrats on the 
defensive 
that does not bode well for a bipartisan working relationship 
with the new democratic leadership team in the house said rep 
beryl anthony dark chairman of the partys house campaign 
organization

a larger share of women than men were found to 
have used cocaine in voluntary drug tests conducted after they were 
arrested in four cities a justice department study says 
cocaine use by women exceeded that of men arrested in new york 
washington dc kansas city and portland ore according to the 
drug use forecasting study by the national institute of justice 
the study was conducted in 14 major cities among men and women 
who volunteered for drug testing after being arrested 
we were surprised to learn from duf that among arrested 
persons women tested positive for illicit drugs at about the same 
rates as did men at all test sites james k stewart director of 
the national institute of justice said in a statement released 
sunday 
for many years it had been thought that males were more 
likely than were women to be illicit drug users stewart said 
overall the study found that more than half of the men arrested 
and tested were discovered to have used at least one type of drug 
with an overwhelming 82 percent of the males in philadelphia 
testing positive for drug use 
there should be no longer any question as to how much of a 
catalyst for crime the lust for illegal drugs has become in america 
today attorney general dick thornburgh said in a statement 
drug users and traffickers will beat rob and kill anyone for 
drugs and profits 
the study reviewed results in 14 major cities from october 
through december 1988 the tests checked for the presence of 
cocaine marijuana opiates including heroin pcp amphetamines 
darvon valium methaqualone methadone and barbiturates 
womens cocaine use exceeded that of men arrested in new york 
73 percent to 67 percent washington dc 65 percent to 62 
percent kansas city 57 percent to 41 percent and portland ore 
50 percent to 37 percent the study said 
those higher percentages continued a trend noticed in an earlier 
study covering july through september 1988 
in the earlier report washington women led the pack with 78 
percent testing positive for cocaine use compared with 59 percent 
for the men in portland the figures were 63 percent of the women 
and 48 percent of the men while the figures for other cities were 
los angeles 57 percent and 55 percent dallas 53 percent and 52 
percent san diego 52 percent and 38 percent and phoenix 31 
percent and 25 percent 
after philadelphia the second highest percentage for use of 
drugs by arrested men was in san diego with 80 percent followed 
by new york and chicago 78 percent each new orleans 75 percent 
and portland and birmingham ala 70 percent 
rounding out the list were detroit 69 percent cleveland 68 
percent dallas and phoenix 57 percent st louis 56 percent and 
kansas city 54 percent 
washington dc which did not test for the presence of 
marijuana had 68 percent of the men test positive for at least one 
of the other drugs tested 
most of the men tested had been arrested for felony offenses 
other than the sale or possession of drugs slightly more than half 
of the men charged with homicide tested positive for an illicit 
drug 
among women tested those found positive for use of at least one 
of the 10 types of drugs ranged from a high of 80 percent in san 
diego to a low of 45 percent in st louis the report said 
cocaine use among men arrested despite the higher percentage 
among women in some cities has increased dramatically in some 
areas the report found 
stewart said the discovery that about onefourth of those tested 
in 13 cities said during interviews that they had injected drugs 
raises a health concern 
meanwhile only about onequarter of those arrested tested and 
interviewed said they needed drug or alcohol abuse treatment 
this suggests the need for improved supervision monitoring 
or courtmandated requirements for arrestees to stay off drugs and 
get treatment stewart said

a civil rights group is applauding a supreme 
court decision that restricts the israeli armys right to demolish 
the homes of palestinians suspected of taking part in the uprising 
in the occupied lands 
in its strongest move yet to limit the armys powers to quell 
the 19monthold rebellion israels highest court on sunday ruled 
that the military must allow appeals before destroying homes 
the ruling was in response to an appeal by the association for 
civil rights in israel 
our association has always believed that the drastic step of 
demolition of houses is a form of collective punishment which 
is not justified association member david presler said on israel 
radio 
the threemember court ordered the army to inform owners of 
houses slated for demolition that they could appeal to a military 
commander and the supreme court 
it said that in some cases a house may be sealed before the 
appeal hearing as opposed to demolition which is irreversible 
presiding judge meir shamgar said however that the army has 
the right to immediately demolish a house in case of operational 
military needs such as in combat 
a military spokesman said 227 houses have been demolished in the 
occupied territories during the uprising palestinian groups say 
the number is higher 
the us state department in february said the demolitions 
violated the geneva conventions on human rights and ignored due 
process because suspects houses were torn down before they were 
tried 
the israeli foreign ministry responded by saying the measure was 
used only in very exceptional circumstances as dictated by 
compelling security requirements 
in court arguments the state prosecutors office and the army 
said an appeal period is granted automatically according to army 
policy except in serious and exceptional cases that involve 
fatalities or injuries 
justice minister dan meridor said in an army radio interview 
that there was no reason to change the law we are talking about 
the use of emergency regulations he said 
since the uprising began in december 1987 at least 525 
palestinians have been killed in clashes with army troops and 
israeli settlers in the occupied lands thirtyeight israelis have 
died 
in addition palestinians have killed 85 fellow arabs accused of 
collaborating with israel during the uprising

investigators probing the crash of a dc10 
in iowa have recalled metal disks from the tail engines of six 
other dc10s to check for possible flaws a government spokesman 
said 
the recall was recommended after national transportation safety 
board investigators found the 3footdiameter disks which hold the 
fan blades of the general electric co engines may have been cut 
from the same slab of metal used in the jet that crashed said ted 
lopatkiewicz an ntsb spokesman 
investigators want to examine the quality of the metal used in 
making the disks he said sunday 
the agencys investigators believe the fan section of the engine 
on united airlines flight 232 disintegrated in flight possibly 
causing the hydraulicsteering system failure that caused the july 
19 crash in sioux city iowa the crash killed 111 people 
the disk from flight 232 hasnt been found 
a spokesman for ges aircraft engines division dwight weber 
said it had not been determined that the parts being removed from 
the six jetliners contained flaws 
the recall is part of a datagathering procedure in order to 
see if they can tell anything about the missing disk weber said 
by telephone from his home in cincinnati were going to work 
with the ntsb to look them over 
neither weber nor lopatkiewicz would identify the airliners with 
disks being recalled but lopatkiewicz said one was operated by a 
foreign airline and the others were flown by us carriers 
the disks are believed to have come from a billet or slab of 
titanium used in 1970 at ges jet engine plant in the cincinnati 
suburb of evendale lopatkiewicz said 
we dont have the disk from the actual aircraft 
lopatkiewicz said by telephone from his home in falls church va 
so by looking at others made from same billet we might be able 
to learn something about the metallurgical quality of the disk 
were looking for 
the parts will be sent to ges evendale plant where flight 
232s three cf66 engines were built lopatkiewicz said they will 
be examined by an ntsb team investigating the crash 
originally eight disks for ges cf66 engine were made from the 
titanium slab lopatkiewicz said one of the eight disks failed 
qualitycontrol tests and was scrapped and another was used in the 
tail engine of flight 232 he said the cf66 engine was produced 
exclusively for the dc10 
the six others are being removed from the commercial jetliners 
and most likely will be replaced before the aircraft return to the 
skies he said 
last week weber denied speculation by rep john dingell 
dmich that scrap parts may have been used in the dc10 engine 
that apparently failed on the iowa flight 
dingell who chairs a house energy and commerce subcommittee 
that oversees crash investigations has asked the federal aviation 
administration to investigate whether scrap parts were used

the dollar dropped against the japanese yen in 
tokyo monday while the key index on the tokyo stock exchange moved 
sharply higher 
the dollar closed at 13840 yen down 105 yen from fridays 
13945yen finish after opening at 13890 yen it ranged between 
13815 and 13910 yen 
on the stock market the nikkei stock average of 225 selected 
issues added 24824 points or 072 percent closing at 3495387 
yet another record high 
toru kanai a foreign exchange analyst with new japan securities 
co said the dollar fell gradually because the us federal 
reserve boards move to relax monetary policy has made it less 
attractive to japanese buyers 
last week the federal reserve board was seen taking a relaxed 
credit position by allowing the federal fund rate to move to 9 
percent from 925 percent 
the federal fund rate the fee that banks charge one another on 
overnight loans is considered a barometer of the central banks 
credit policy 
there is nothing happening here to turn investors away from 
buying the dollar except for the market sentiment for a weaker 
dollar due to expectations that the fed might further relax the 
monetary policy kanai said 
on the stock exchange market trading was directionless 
although the index rose said masahiro umemori a stock analyst 
with nomura securities 
he attributed the nikkeis rebound to the yens strength against 
the dollar on the foreign exchange market

the jaunty visage of his father smiles from one 
wall and a workedover cigar peeks out of an ashtray but family 
resemblance is not the reason richard m daley looks so comfortable 
at city hall after just 100 days in office 
confidence is 
the chunky goodnatured 47yearold son of richard j daley 
the last of the bigcity political bosses is clearly on a roll 
daley does not hesitate when asked whether any problem has 
seemed overwhelming in the short time since he stepped down as 
states attorney walked across the street and set up shop in the 
fifthfloor office his father occupied for more than 20 years 
if i just threw up my hands over one problem then maybe id 
do it over another one and then again and again and pretty soon 
the only reaction id have to anything would be walking around and 
throwing up my arms said daley who took office on his birthday 
april 24 
his disarming wit and quick grasp of the workings of government 
have surprised critics who ridiculed his carefully scripted 
campaign appearances and referred to him as dumbdumb daley 
after a few days in office he won praise for disdaining use of 
the citys 50000 armorplated limousine after quipping that in 
the event of a nuclear attack hed likely find himself the only 
survivor 
similarly he has confounded black opponents who predicted his 
election would bring a return to the machine politics of his 
father instead daley appropriated the central theme of their 
campaigns empowerment of minorities and the disenfranchised 
eleven of his 21 cabinet appointments went to minorities a 
percentage roughly representative of the citys population and one 
of his first executive decisions was to extend the 
affirmativeaction program that was a legacy of the late mayor 
harold washington chicagos first black mayor 
daley helped engineer and guide through the city council a 
measure channeling revenues from an increased tax on cigarettes to 
provide additional shelters for the homeless even his bitterest 
enemies conceded it was innovative 
still some critics say daleys good spin control conceals a 
lack of specific achievement 
hes been pretty much the way we expected said lu palmer a 
radio show host and selfdescribed black nationalist 
he hired a few africanamericans for certain spots but most 
of them were safe blacks and most of it was done to help his 
chances to consolidate his power on matters of police brutality 
poverty schools things dont seem any better and they may even be 
worse 
and whats made it worse is how slick hes been about 
everything and the honeymoon he seems to be carrying on with the 
media palmer said 
daley ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 1983 then earlier this 
year after three terms as prosecutor he defeated two of the 
citys top black politicians acting mayor eugene sawyer and 
alderman tim evans in a special election for the right to serve 
the final two years of washingtons second term 
in his reelection bid daley expects to face many of the same 
doubts that dogged his steps the last time out especially from 
those in the black community who insist his main qualification 
remains his name 
huge property tax increases passed by the previous 
administration have proved a twoedged sword deepening the citys 
pockets but inspiring nascent revolt in the northwest side 
bungalow belt whose residents have been one of his strongest 
constituencies 
he seems like a man very much in control i wouldnt bet 
against him said mike royko the pulitzer prizewinning 
columnist of the chicago tribune 
at this point youd have to say so far so good of course 
royko added thats what the guy who jumps off the top of the 
john hancock building says as he passes the 40th floor

states broader leeway to regulate abortion 
several acknowledged the issue may dominate their states 
politics and legislatures in coming months 
it will bring out some polarized feelings said delaware 
gov michael castle a republican i think in the course of the 
next year or two that will be a dominant issue 
its important that we not let it dominate our state 
legislatures castle said it has that ability to dominate 
things so much that you cant do anything else 
another governor sharing that concern was marylands william 
donald schaefer 
schaefer a democrat said he would ask the legislature to 
confine debate and action on abortion to the first 30 days of its 
next session 
otherwise it could disrupt and cause great problems said 
schaefer who since taking office has backed off a campaign 
statement supporting medicaid funding for abortions 
virginia gov gerald baliles chairman of the association said 
the governors werent discussing abortion because their agenda was 
set before the supreme courts ruling in a missouri case 
baliles a democrat who supports legal abortions in most cases 
said formal discussion by the governors wouldnt likely produce an 
agreement anyway 
this is a decision that will have to be argued within each 
state he said it is a topic that is unlikely to achieve the 
kind of consensus that would produce a policy resolution by the 
national governors association 
in interviews several governors sought to minimize the 
discretion afforded to the states by the high court decision which 
eroded but did not overturn the earlier roe vs wade decision 
upholding a womans right to an abortion 
they had an eye however on abortion cases scheduled to come 
before the supreme court this fall 
you wont really know what the dimensions of this issue is 
until the supreme court decides the three other cases pending 
said arkansas gov bill clinton a democrat its an emotional 
issue if the supreme court overturns roe v wade youve got a 
whole different issue 
most people are waiting for the other shoe to drop said 
castle 
in view of polls saying a majority of america support legalized 
abortion in some cases the issue may pose more political problems 
for candidates who favor restricting or banning abortion at least 
in some states in the two governors races this year in virginia 
and new jersey the republican nominees have softened their 
antiabortion stands in recent weeks 
republican governors will have a look at a new poll on the 
issue commissioned by their party at a closed meeting tuesday 
said michele davis executive director of the republican governors 
association the conference ends tuesday 
gov thomas kean of new jersey a republican who leaves office 
after this year said he hoped the issue would not be so divisive 
that voters elect candidates solely on how they stand on abortion 
i think it would be a great tragedy if people were to decide 
who to vote for just on this issue because i think wed elect some 
very strange people he said

the rev jesse jackson says president bush has 
offered no substance to support his professed commitment to civil 
rights 
jackson interviewed on nbctvs meet the press on sunday 
criticized bush for backing recent supreme court rulings opposed by 
civil rights leaders failing to strengthen the civil rights 
commission and lacking a comprehensive plan to fight drugs 
he credited bush for directing less antagonism toward civil 
rights than did his predecessor ronald reagan but added so far 
no substance 
jackson said bushs nomination of a black lawyer republican 
william lucas to serve as the justice departments chief civil 
rights advocate was a sinister play on race 
jackson said lucas was unqualified for the position because he 
lacks trial experience but that there are other republican 
minorities who are suited to the job

a federal agency judge says a texas 
obstetrician let his fear of a malpractice lawsuit cloud his 
judgment when he ordered a poor sick woman who was about to give 
birth transferred to another hospital 160 miles away 
dr michael l burditt is the first physician prosecuted for 
violating a 1986 federal law against patient dumping he is 
expected to fight the 20000 civil penalty imposed upon him by the 
department of health and human services 
the agency on sunday released the 44page ruling by 
administrative law judge charles e stratton upholding the hhs 
inspector generals sanctions against burditt but reducing the fine 
from 25000 to 20000 
the texas medical association has agreed to pay burditts legal 
costs and any fine stemming from his handling of the case of rosa 
rivera 
mrs rivera showed up at the emergency room of detar hospital in 
victoria on dec 5 1986 to have her sixth child without seeing a 
doctor during the pregnancy and with blood pressure of 210 over 160 
high enough to cause stroke and death 
burditt then chief of the hospitals obstetrical department 
was summoned by phone to treat the indigent woman because he was 
next on a list to handle emergency obstetrical calls 
burditt examined the woman and ordered her transferred to a 
better equipped hospital in galveston despite the objections of 
nurses worried that it would violate the thennew law against 
patient dumping which specifies that hospitals must treat patients 
in medical emergencies or in active labor 
burditt said he would choose his patients until detar a private 
hospital paid his malpractice premiums 
mrs rivera bore a healthy 6pound baby boy in the ambulance 
parked on the roadside 40 miles east of victoria

the federal bureau of land management has let 
commercial and recreational interests take priority over the 
protection of wildlife in the california desert government 
auditors say 
the general accounting office said in a report released sunday 
that while there has been a shortage of money to develop wildlife 
protection plans even if more funds were available blm has 
not demonstrated the willingness to take actions necessary to 
protect wildlife interests 
for example the gao said the bureau has permitted motorcycle 
races and established free play areas for offhighway vehicles 
in areas important to the desert tortoise has allowed livestock 
grazing that is harmful to some species and has placed 
insufficient restrictions on mining operations 
blm has frequently allowed the needs of competing interests 
such as recreation and commercial use to take precedence over 
wildlife interests when conflicts arise the gao said 
it said data on the desert tortoise an important gauge for the 
health of habitat for other species in the desert indicate that 
the effects are not favorable 
desert tortoise numbers have decreased dramatically in recent 
years and according to tortoise experts the species may now be 
sliding irreversibly toward extinction the gao said

andrei d sakharov picked to help lead a new 
opposition coalition in the soviet congress says the nations 
empirelike structure must be dismantled to end a wave of 
ethnic unrest 
sakharov and populist boris n yeltsin were among five lawmakers 
chosen sunday to lead a 390member faction in the 2250member 
congress of peoples deputies it is the first soviet opposition 
coalition in 70 years 
yeltsin a former alternate member of the ruling politburo who 
has remade himself into a populist reformer won the most votes 
among 13 candidates for the fivemember governing board of the 
interregional deputies group 
the group gave itself the bland name in part to allay suspicions 
it is an opposition party in a country where the communist party 
has been the only legal party since the early 1920s 
on sunday when the group was to work out its program it 
managed to agree only on calls for several parliamentary 
commissions 
they include commissions to investigate responsibility for the 
soviet intervention in afghanistan and to study ethnic unrest in 
the republic of uzbekistan in december 1986 
in an interview published sunday in the weekly ogonyok magazine 
sakharov reiterated his respect for president mikhail s gorbachev 
but said the country is on the verge of economic catastrophe and 
that he considers a military or rightwing coup a possibility 
sakharov said the soviet union must tear down the centrally 
controlled system built by josef stalin and start all over again 
our starting point is a forced empirelike structure and we 
cannot dismantle it partially it has to be done completely and 
reassemble the pieces into a whole new structure the popular 
weekly quoted him as saying 
the 15 soviet republics and other homelands set aside for the 
soviet unions more than 100 ethnic groups should get 
independence to the maximum degree sakharov was quoted as saying 
their sovereignty should have the minimal limits of common 
defense foreign policy transport and communications he added 
about 390 congress deputies including most of the bestknown 
political and economic reformers have joined the new group about 
260 of them took part in a twoday meeting that ended sunday but 
by sunday afternoon just 155 were around to take part in the voting 
yeltsin received 144 votes for the governing board followed by 
historian yuri afanasyev with 143 economist gavriil popov with 
132 scholar viktor palm from estonia with 73 and sakharov human 
rights activist and winner of the 1975 nobel peace prize with 69 
yeltsin said he did not forsee the group eventually becoming a 
majority in the congress which was elected this spring in the 
countrys first contested elections in seven decades 
he said the group was created for the protection of the 
minority adding that the minority is now organized and solid 
enough and we will help fight for each others positions 
the group unveiled its own newspaper the peoples deputy at 
the gathering the paper said the group grew out of the despair 
of the radically inclined minority at the conservative views of 
the majority of congress members 
the official tass news agency said saturday that the group was 
made up of leftradicals but that they still could work within 
the system on sunday it quoted one deputy alexander gelman as 
saying radical approaches were necessary to reform the soviet 
system 
radicalism of the deputies assembled here is nothing other 
than realism tass quoted gelman as saying

a clinic that is denying or delaying 
abortions for women who dont agree with its prochoice philosophy 
has aroused the ire of some feminists but praise from others who 
say it exposes double standards 
at least two women seeking abortions initially were turned away 
from the allentown womens center because they did not believe 
abortion should be legal both women eventually were given 
abortions one had changed her mind and the second woman agreed 
not to make negative comments about her abortion 
the clinic also demands that women sign a document in which they 
waive their right to confidentiality if they declare they were 
exploited by the experience 
if a woman tells us she does not think abortion should be 
legal we tell her we cannot provide an abortion for her said 
sylvia stengle the clinic director when they find themselves in 
that position they have a moral change or think they are a special 
case we send them away to think about it 
molly yard president of the national organization for women 
said the policy contradicts the premise of choice 
it seems to me women have a constitutional right and thats 
what our whole prochoice movement is based on ms yard said 
why are they even asking that question ive never heard of such 
a thing 
david j andrews executive vice president of the planned 
parenthood federation of america faulted the clinic for acting 
like its antiabortion counterparts 
to hold women hostage because of any political belief is 
reprehensible andrews said to create a litmus test as a 
requirement to their clinic is really resorting to our opponents 
way of doing things 
ms stengle and other clinic directors said its frustrating to 
deal with women who believe abortion is wrong but insist on their 
narrow right to the procedure 
myra south of the missouri chapter of the national organization 
for women said she was delighted with ms stengle for exposing 
hypocrisy 
they want to come through the back door they think they are 
better than some women she said 
dr robert blomberg regional director of planned parenthood for 
15 western states said providing health care should supercede 
political divisiveness 
ideally a woman requesting an abortion would respect other 
womens rights but i would hope thats not a litmus test for 
providing care he said 
ms stengle said abortion rights are in political jeopardy so 
its hard for her staff to be supportive of antiabortion patients 
she said 15 of every 100 patients are opposed to abortion one 
in every hundred believes that the procedure should not be legal 
she said 
sue roselle executive director of womens health services in 
pittsburgh said she also agrees with ms stengles policy she 
said there are cases in which antiabortionists go to clinics for 
abortions and afterward will be right back on the picket line 
why do we have to serve everybody that comes to our door we 
have freedom of choice as providers she said

the government should offer suspected soviet 
spy felix s bloch immunity to get him to reveal what secrets he 
divulged rather than try to arrest him a former prosecutor says 
former us attorney joseph digenova said sunday even in the 
best of circumstances espionage cases are very difficult to make 
in the area of what has been referred to as the wilderness of 
mirrors 
you try to get them to disgorge enough information to confirm 
what you already have and then use that for leads digenova who 
prosecuted the jonathan pollard spy case several years ago said on 
abcs this week with david brinkley 
but most accounts indicate that bloch a 30year state 
department veteran has been reluctant to reveal why he reportedly 
was seen passing a briefcase to a soviet kgb agent a few months ago 
in paris 
bloch 54 has not been charged with any crime but has been 
under 24hour surveillance by the fbi 
sources have said bloch was recruited by the soviets when he 
served at the newly opened us embassy in east berlin in 1974 he 
later served at the us embassy in austria long a hotbed for 
eastwest espionage activities from 1980 to 1987 
bloch whose state department access has been suspended 
reportedly admitted to having taken money from the kgb 
french newspapers this weekend reported that bloch was filmed by 
french agents at the beginning of this year passing a briefcase to 
a kgb agent involved in circumventing a ban on the sale of high 
technology to the soviets 
the weekly journal du dimanche reported sunday that the man with 
bloch in the film was a member of the soviet diplomatic mission to 
unesco but the newspaper said the soviet diplomat actually was a 
spy working for a new kgb service known as agency 4 charged with 
stealing sensitive technology secrets 
digenova said the united states should offer bloch immunity 
bring him before a grand jury and threaten him with an 18month 
prison term for contempt of court if he fails to answer the 
questions 
several administration sources have suggested that any 
admissions made by bloch to the fbi or state department 
investigators fell well short of the legal requirements for arrest 
the focus now according to digenova must center on learning what 
has been revealed to soviet agents 
one of the pressing questions to which digenova said a response 
is needed is how word of the us investigation of bloch was leaked 
and whether there are soviet moles inside the government 
according to sources the soviets contacted the diplomat and told 
him he was under investigation 
that is a very dangerous and concerning revelation that he 
was warned by his kgb handler after the united states government 
had begun its investigation digenova said 
stanislav levchenko a former kgb officer said it is not 
impossible at all that at some level there can be one two three 
other assets of the soviets who one way or another learned about 
this investigation and tipped him off 
sen david l boren chairman of the senates intelligence 
committee said lessons should be learned from the bloch case 
because such incidents are inevitable 
most people think that we have glasnost we have arms control 
negotiations going on the problem is over were having a much 
better relationship with the soviet union the oklahoma democrat 
said on abc its ironic as star wars winds down spy wars 
are heating up 
and it makes sense as military budgets are being cut for 
example in the soviet union they are desperate to get 
technology

the government and opposition both say 
the voters decision to approve a package of farreaching 
constitutional reforms will help revive democracy after 16 years of 
military rule 
but the opposition is promising to push for more reforms 
including a clause that would prevent gen augusto pinochet from 
continuing to run the army after he steps down as president next 
year 
the 54 reforms approved sunday included amendments that would 
lift a ban on marxist activities end political exile and reduce 
the powers of the president 
the government said the final tally was 5735032 votes in favor 
and 550888 against meaning 857 percent of the voters approved of 
the amendments void and blank votes totaled 408868 
government officials and opposition leaders said approval of the 
54 reforms which were the result of an unprecedented agreement 
between the military regime and its foes should help stabilize the 
political system 
pinochet in a speech on national radio and television late 
sunday called the vote historic and said the amended 
constitution is the most efficient way to consolidate an 
authentically democratic system 
opposition leaders while insisting that further reforms are 
needed praised those passed sunday as a step toward the 
restoration of full democracy 
patricio aylwin the opposition candidate to succeed pinochet in 
national elections set for dec 14 said the reforms will make 
the task easier for the future government to rebuild democracy and 
will aid to the reconciliation among chileans 
aylwin favored by most opinion polls to win the election said 
sundays vote also showed that the people want agreement among 
chileans rather than confrontation a reference to the fact that 
the reforms were agreed upon by the government and the opposition 
aylwin and other opposition leaders said they would seek other 
constitutional changes after voters choose a new congress in the 
dec 14 elections the new government would take office march 11 
one of the main changes approved sunday would make it easier for 
congress to effect further constitutional reforms which could aid 
the opposition plans 
pinochet however has made clear he is not prepared to easily 
allow more changes to the constitution which was written by his 
military regime 
in his speech sunday night he warned that he and the armed 
forces have vowed in a solemn manner to ensure that the 
constitution will be respected 
pinochet 73 has ruled since a bloody 1973 military coup 
overthrew elected president salvador allende a marxist pinochet 
agreed to amend the constitution only after voters in october 
rejected a proposal by the military to extend his rule until 1997 
despite losing that referendum pinochet will retain a decisive 
influence after stepping down from the presidency in march the 
constitution allows him to retain command of the 60000men army 
the basis of his power since the 1973 coup and the general has 
said he intends to hold on to the post 
opposition members had hoped to include an amendment on sunday 
that would eliminate that provision but the government refused 
some pinochet followers saw the approval of the amendments as a 
vote of support 
hernan buchi the progovernment presidential hopeful said the 
vote should be a sample of our behavior in the future because it 
has shown our capacity to reach agreements to advance toward 
democracy 
the principal amendments approved on sunday include eliminating 
a presidents authority to send citizens into exile and dissolve 
the lower house of congress 
they also eased restrictions on marxist activity which was 
banned under the original constitutional the changes are to take 
effect within 15 days interior minister carlos caceres said 
there was relatively little voter interest in the referendum 
because its terms had been agreed upon in advance by the government 
and its foes but voter turnout was high because voting is 
mandatory in this south american nation of 13 million people 
citizens who fail to cast a ballot may be fined

some people were not born to live in a socialist 
system miguel is one of them 
miguel not his real name is an educated man in his late 50s 
who has lived in uneasy intimacy with fidel castros revolution for 
three decades he doesnt seem to belong 
known as a dissident although a harmless one miguel works as a 
guard receiving the lowest salary he says the law permits 100 
pesos a month 
his diet is mindnumbing in its lack of variety although it is 
not clear whether the problem is more the result of apathy or 
scarcity he has one meal a day consisting almost always of two or 
more fried eggs and a scoop of rice 
asked why he is not slim miguel says his normal weight is 250 
pounds so that for him 215 pounds is skinny 
he is asked why his diet is so limited he invites his 
questioner to inspect a bakery a block away the shelves are empty 
but there is a promise of bread in two hours he suggests the 
promise may be as empty as the shelves 
what about fruits or vegetables with a wave of the hand he 
suggests that these are occasionally available but often arrive at 
the market too rotten to eat 
to fight hunger miguel smokes a pack of cigarettes a day that 
means onethird of his income goes up in smoke 
he is part of a subculture here which looks on the revolution 
with disdain every country has an unassimilable subculture and 
cuba is no exception 
miguel has been at the bottom of the heap for some time but 
cuban officials point out that people like miguel at least have a 
job a place to live food on the table and access to medical care 
this indeed is what sets cuba apart cuba guarantees a minimal 
living standard for its people most other countries dont come 
close to that ideal 
there are tens of millions elsewhere in latin america who dont 
live nearly as well as miguel but the psychic pain he suffers is 
great because before the revolution he once commanded respect as 
an educated professional who used to enjoy the good life 
restaurants nightclubs the theater 
the government has pegged him as ideologically unreliable so he 
is condemned to his mundane unchallenging existence he cant get 
permission to leave the country 
a walk with miguel through the streets of havana elicits from 
him unbridled criticism of what castros revolution has wrought 
he whines about street crime smokebelching buses crumbling 
buildings the absence of places to buy even a soft drink the long 
lines for public transportation the political repression 
to underscore the countrys housing shortage he points out a 
unique cuban institution called a posada that is where lovers 
usually young and with no access to privacy at home can spend some 
quiet time together in a nofrills room 
continuing his stroll through the city miguel wistfully recalls 
when havana was a lovely modern capital it is now terribly 
rundown 
the revolution has indeed shown little concern for maintaining 
the splendor albeit defective of midcentury havana attention 
has been focused instead on the countryside so woefully neglected 
by castros rightist predecessors 
countless numbers suffered appalling deprivation with little 
hope of a decent job schooling or medical care a quarter of the 
cuban population was illiterate 
castro visited camaguey province 300 miles east of here this 
past week and ticked off the long list of advances in almost every 
economic and social category since the revolution the list sounds 
impressive 
and according to some us estimates over onethird of all 
cubans live better than they did before the revolution 
even after 30 years castros appearance generates emotional 
responses many cubans still sense that fidel as they call 
him is no ordinary mortal 
but the day before castro spoke there was evidence that 
shortages extend well beyond havana 
long lines of shoppers were seen all over camaguey at one 
store several hundred people waited for hours to buy tins of a 
european import roughly equivalent to spam the price was 3 pesos 
or about 375 for a 4ounce can the average wage in cuba is 
little over a peso an hour 
to the extent there are hardships the average cuban confronts 
them with grace and humor 
and to castro the alternative is the egotistical brutal and 
inhumane capitalist system as he said last wednesday dont tell 
that to miguel

the dozen or so residents of an 1870s nevada 
boomtown calling themselves davids to a small mining companys 
goliath are fighting for their homes and town as the company 
moves to level buildings in a gold hunt 
homeowners in tuscarora a flyspeck on the map 250 miles 
northeast of reno have been told we are nothing more than 
squatters richard schupbach said at a news conference last week 
the people out there are being run roughshod over simply 
because theres only a handful of people said environmentalist 
bob fulkerson this is a classic david and goliath issue 
bob jones of horizon gold shares of denver called it a david 
vs david battle 
the company which has about 100 employees plans to dig a pit 
mine that would consume half the community 
the problem is its a town and we cant move schupbach 
said and once they mine it it will be gone and gone forever 
the dozen yearround residents and two dozen homeowners are 
asking the elko county commission to grant historic status to 
buildings in the community which would give them some protection 
from development plans 
in the 1870s the northeastern nevada community had 4000 
residents drawn by the historic dexter mine 
the commission plans to meet aug 15 in tuscarora to discuss the 
proposal 
under state law mining companies can condemn property but 
horizon president john watson has said the company would use 
eminent domain only as a last resort 
jones general manager of the mining operation said in a 
telephone interview from tuscarora the company has invested 8 
million in the operation and has offered to buy out homeowners 
even though it owns the land top price for the homes is 50000 
he said 
jones said horizon plans to file legal papers in august to take 
over the land 
we think the residents are overreacting jones said they 
are on privatelyowned land ours were not even sure they have 
anything to sell basically they have very little legal ground to 
stand on most of them came in the 1960s and kind of squatted 
here 
residents disagree many said they have legal documentation to 
prove they own the buildings 
fulkerson executive director of citizen alert an environmental 
group said horizon gold shares came to tuscarora in 1987 to 
rape pillage and plunder by digging a 400by800 foot wide 
150foot deep open pit mine just south of the town 
residents complain that the mining exploratory work has cracked 
home foundations and caused other damage 
elko county manager george boucher said tuscarora homeowners are 
at the mercy of the mining company because the town does not have a 
legal status when tuscarora was created somebody forgot to file 
the map 
but fulkerson said residents have always paid property taxes to 
the county establishing tuscarora as a real town 
schupbach a stanford university professor said he plans to 
retire to ghosttown life in tuscarora if the town still 
exists 
another resident dennis parks moved to tuscarora in 1966 to 
start a pottery school now he wonders if hell be moving out soon 
it seemed like a safe place to live he lamented it 
certainly looked like all industrial activity was in the past

the crippled tanker exxon valdez arrived in san 
diego bay for repairs and possibly a name change four months after 
its disastrous oil spill fouled alaskan waters and miles of 
coastline 
everything went like clockwork it was a piece of cake said 
capt edward j silva jr the senior harbor pilot who brought the 
valdez in sunday 
tugboats nudged the ship to a pier at the national steel and 
shipbuilding co for a ninemonth 25 million repair job ending a 
2500mile trek from prince william sound 
the docking closed a chapter in a grim environmental saga that 
began when the 970foot ship rammed bligh reef in alaskas prince 
william sound on march 24 
the hull tore open and about 11 million gallons of crude gushed 
into the sound thousands of animals were killed and miles of 
coastline were stained the cleanup continues 
when an 18mile oil slick coincided with the valdezs arrival 
off california on july 10 the coast guard barred the ship from the 
harbor 
tests from slick samples revealed degraded north slope alaskan 
crude and concentrations of marine organisms that inhabited the 
shredded cargo tanks 
coast guard lt larry solberg said no further discharges were 
spotted sunday 
exxon shipping co president frank iarossi continued to deny the 
valdez was responsible for the earlier slick and at least two 
others off the coast as charged by state department of fish and 
game officials 
there was no oil on that ship people are losing sight of that 
fact he said 
reed smith a fish and game department response coordinator 
said he was not impressed with the denial 
how do you discuss with him how to prevent more oil spills 
when hes not admitting he had one at all smith said 
hundreds of people watched from shore as the valdez entered the 
bay and rounded north island sailing past waterfront hotels and 
navy warships 
coast guard and harbor patrol boats guarded a security zone 
around the tanker ships with pollution containment and salvage 
equipment followed 
greenpeace boats shadowed the vessel activist kelly quirke said 
greenpeace was protesting a fossilfuel energy policy that is not 
only destroying the ocean but the atmosphere 
the valdez will be moved to dry dock after an underwater survey 
of damage iarossi said 30 percent of the hull is either gone or 
cannot rest on the blocks that usually hold up a vessel in dry dock 
iarossi also disclosed that exxon may try to remove the stigma 
from the ship by changing its name 
rechristening wouldnt be in order but we are considering 
whether we should start a new career for the vessel with a new 
name he said 
the repair job stirred excitement at the shipyard which expects 
to add 300 people and boost its work force to 3000 
ships capt tom hill said that getting the crippled vessel into 
port was accomplishment enough 
we did everything humanly possible to save this ship without 
impacting the environment he said 
under an agreement with state agencies the valdez had to be 
leakfree for 24 hours prior to entry and accompanied by a 
pollution response vessel 
exxon put 20 million in a bond and a trust account to cover 
cleanup costs in the event of a spill in local waters

norr a freelance mathematics textbook writer with a computer 
science background said the game is more than knowledge of words 
its very mathematical she said a lot of its even 
spatial relationships and decisions about when to challenge when 
not to challenge when to close the board when to open it 
constantly keeping track of where you are in the game and how many 
tiles are left 
but loera thompson a 75yearold mississippi native doesnt 
take it so seriously

hes been laughed at for using jimminy 
crickets droppings for fertilizer but bill bricker gets the last 
laugh when he hoists his threepound tomatoes to promote his 
kricket krap 
the retired army colonel invents organic fertilizers like 
kricket krap which he sells from his 10acre farm along the 
savannah river near augusta 
its what the name says cricket droppings bricker said 
i dont know why people never thought of it before crickets eat 
25 percent protein thats better than you or i eat 
once a month bricker buys about six tons of droppings from two 
local cricket farms where the insects are raised as bait and their 
droppings collected with a huge vacuum cleaner 
he bags the droppings and sells them around the country via his 
mail order service 
bricker said he also wants to educate the south about the values 
of organic farming but its also a milliondollar business and he 
goes to great lengths for a sale 
his first fertilizer was a combination of leaves hay and old 
vegetables baked in the sun when it sold poorly he televised an 
ad that showed an egg cooking in a plastic bag in the middle of the 
compost pile 
then he ate the egg

repairs to the governments three 
tritiumproducing nuclear reactors will take longer and will cost 
more than four times the previous estimate a newspaper reported 
today 
in december the energy department estimated that repairs at the 
savannah river site in south carolina would cost 350 million and 
be completed in 1990 
but a confidential report submitted to the department on june 26 
by the westinghouse savannah river co said the project will cost 
at least 166 billion and wont be completed until 1991 the new 
york times reported 
the complexs three reactors are the nations sole source of 
tritium a shortlived radioactive gas essential for many nuclear 
weapons because tritium decays to inert helium the tritium charge 
must be renewed from time to time 
energy secretary james d watkins planned to announce on tuesday 
a fiveyear plan to bring all of the nations nuclear weapons 
production plants into compliance with environmental and safety 
laws the washington post reported today 
under the proposal the department would spend 24 billion next 
year and up to 37 billion in each of the following four years 
watkins told the post the plan would include management of 
hazardous waste and restoration of the environment around the 
plants 
the three reactors at savannah river have been shut for more 
than a year because of safety and management concerns during the 
shutdown the previous contractor du pont corp withdrew and the 
government hired the westinghouse electric corp subsidiary to 
operate the plant 
the energy department pays for operation of the plant and the 
additional money will come from the departments budget 
the confidential report calls for restarting the first reactor 
in september 1990 the second in december 1990 and the third in 
february 1991 the times said 
jack herrmann spokesman for westinghouse savannah river said 
the company has submitted plans to the department proposing a 
timetable and cost estimates for restarting the reactors 
the plans he said present a number of variables and a number 
of options at this point its an interim process with doe were 
not really in a position to comment because theres a lot of give 
and take in this process 
westinghouse presented a restart plan for the idled kreactor to 
the department on june 26 and supplemental plans for restarting the 
other two reactors on july 10 herrmann said 
herrmann said the department and westinghouse have held 
discussions about the plans off and on the last several weeks 
but there has not been a formal resolution 
experts with the energy department told the times that 
recovering tritium will not be possible until nine months after a 
reactor has been turned on 
this means that the first new supplies will not be available 
until june 1991 defense officials have said some weapons might 
have to be cannibalized to keep other weapons in service if tritium 
production isnt restarted soon 
in addition the plan calls for operating the reactors at half 
their potential power because of concerns about the ability of 
their emergency cooling systems to withstand accidents the times 
said 
in a letter accompanying the plan james s moore president of 
westinghouse savannah river said the delay and extra cost were a 
result of initial difficulties engineers had in understanding the 
magnitude of the changes needed to make the reactors safe 
according to the times

450 miles southeast of new york or about halfway between the city 
and bermuda and was transported to the royal viking star a cruise 
ship with full medical facilities 
ms culvers mother hannah culver said the trip was the first 
major sailing venture for her daughter a legal secretary 
she said abbott had asked her daughter to marry him but she did 
not want to agree until she determined whether she liked long 
sailing trips 
abbott a professional boat transporter lived for the seas and 
spent his summers aboard a boat docked a new york yacht club 
friends said 
she wasnt sure she could survive sailing she gets seasick 
she said if i cant take it i dont want to hold him back 
mrs culver recalled 
wannamaker said the coast guard did not yet know what caused the 
sailboat to sink coast guard lt mike fijalka said there were no 
major storms in the area where the boat went down 
ms culver was in stable condition suffering from exhaustion 
exposure and sunburn but was sleeping and doing well wannamaker 
said 
the coast guard had been searching for the pair since july 23

preserver and was observed to have slumped over by ms culver 
wannamaker said 
i cant believe she was 14 days on that raft how did she 
live said mrs culver 
she said she had been comforted friday night by a dream that her 
daughter was all right 
the good news came by telephone from the coast guard sunday 
morning but it was tinged with sadness that abbott was gone 
i feel so badly because i know him and hes a nice fella 
mrs culver said its terrible

scientists say 106000 people nearly 10 times the 
number recommended by the government should be evacuated from 
their villages because of contamination from the chernobyl nuclear 
plant disaster tass reported 
the supreme soviet or legislature in the republic of 
byelorussia on friday tentatively approved legislation that calls 
for resettling 11000 people during the next five years the soviet 
news agency said 
special attention will be paid to children from areas affected 
by chernobyl fallout tass said 
but during the debate delegates to the national congress of 
peoples deputies attending the session and scientists from 
byelorussia proposed more sweeping measures including the 
evacuation of 106000 people tass said saturday 
the april 26 1986 accident at the no 4 reactor of the 
fourunit nuclear power plant in the soviet ukraine killed two 
workers immediately in the worlds worst atomic accident hundreds 
were hospitalized including 31 who later died from 
radiationrelated injuries 
the accident sent a cloud of radiation over large parts of 
northern and central europe leading to bans on foodstuffs from 
several countries more than 130000 people were evacauted after 
the accident 
the plant is 80 miles north of the ukraine capital of kiev 
byelorussia is north of the ukraine and was in the main path of the 
fallout from the accident 
the government evacuation program for byelorussia is based on 
people who are at risk of being exposed to 35 rems during a 
lifetime a rem is the standard unit of measurement for the amount 
of radiation absorbed by living tissue 
thirtyfive rems is 35000 millirems the typical diagnostic 
chest xray involves between 20 millirems and 30 millirems of 
radiation 
the legislators and scientists recommended that normal living 
conditions be made the criteria rather than a ceiling on the 
cumulative number of rems 
the most controversy was caused by the list of villages whose 
residents need to be resettled to radioactivefree territories 
tass said 
tass said they realized that at a cost of 156 billion their 
proposals could not be realistically handled by the republics 
budget but tass said they feel that chernobyl is a disaster of 
the whole country so the whole country must participate in curing 
the wounds 
however the original proposal to resettle 11000 was adopted on 
the first reading and a standing commission was given the 
assignment of reviewing it and submitting it to the byelorussian 
people for discussion tass said 
the proposed evacuation includes 12 districts with more than 500 
villages in the gomel and mogilev regions about 100 miles 
northest of the chernobyl disaster site

thomas root the lawyer who made a 
mysterious 800mile flight and then crashed in the atlantic says 
hes just a guy who passed out at the controls 
root 36 was flying from washington dc to rocky mount 
nc on july 13 when he says he passed out the plane flew on 
autopilot until it ran out of gas and ditched off the bahamas 
doctors at hollywood fla hospital discovered a bullet wound in 
roots abdomen after the crash 
root who said he can not explain the bullet wound says the 
crash generated a lot of hoopla 
people cant help but read all this stuff and think what 
kind of criminal is this guy he said in an interview saturday 
with radio station wswr in shelby which he owns my response is 
no kind of criminal just a guy that was going to a deposition and 
something happened 
root who was interviewed at his parents house in plymouth 50 
miles southeast of cleveland where he has been recovering 
returned saturday to his home in arlington va 
although blood tests for carbon monoxide were negative root 
said he believes a carbon dioxide buildup may have caused him to 
black out during the flight 
root said he was unaware he had been shot until doctors at the 
hospital told him he said the loaded revolver he kept in the 
planes glove compartment may have gone off on impact a theory 
the manufacturer of the 32caliber smith amp wesson disputed 
root was sued in federal court in new orleans last week by a 
group of investors who allege he lost them 125000 in 1987 by 
misrepresenting them in a bid to obtain a federal communications

leaders of two christian denominations that 
have entered into a working partnership say members will be 
encouraged to worship together but local congregations will 
maintain their own identities 
about 6000 delegates to the christian church disciples of 
christ general assembly agreed saturday to enter into full 
communion including mutual recognition of members and clergy with 
the united church of christ 
the resolution means the two churches will recognize each 
others members as joint believers in a common faith and will make 
an effort to coordinate their social services missionary work and 
community functions said paul crow jr president of the council 
on christian unity 
the united church of christ adopted a similar resolution at its 
convention in fort worth texas a month ago 
the granting of full communion crow said makes the two 
churches brothers rather than cousins 
this is not a merger its not a uniting of the churches 
structure crow said at the convention which continues through 
wednesday this is setting up a common acknowledgement of each 
other 
saturdays endorsement came despite criticism from some members 
of the christian church that the united church of christ is too 
liberal 
the two churches base their faith on the same christian 
doctrine crow said but they differ in some worship practices and 
church policies he said 
for example the united church of christ forbids churches from 
considering sexual orientation in the hiring of ministers that 
means the church officially allows homosexuals to become ministers 
and forbids member churches from discriminating against them 
in putting our stamp of approval on this we are putting our 
stamp of approval on homosexuality said bethel nason of topeka 
kansas 
another delegate mike wolfe of spearman texas charged the 
united church of christ is far to the left both political and 
ecumenically 
but crow says the differences in social beliefs are as common 
within the christian church as they are between the two 
denominations 
the christian church allows for unity in diversity but that 
diversity need not divide us he said 
the christian church disciples of christ was formed in 1832 as 
part of an early frontier movement to unify christians the united 
church of christ was formed in 1961 when the evangelical and 
reformed church merged with the congregational christian churches

authorities executed two men who allegedly killed 
two people and stole guns while robbing a home during this springs 
prodemocracy protests a report in the official media said 
the government also said communist party committees met 
nationwide during the weekend to discuss how to implement an 
anticorruption order ending official corruption was a key demand 
of the prodemocracy movement 
a brief report by the official xinhua news agency late sunday 
identified the executed men as yu chunting and guo zhenghua of the 
central city of wuhan 
it said they killed a pregnant woman and a girl while robbing a 
home during the turmoil of the studentled protests 
the government has attempted to portray the protesters as common 
criminals and has tried to link any nonpolitical crimes committed 
during the upheaval to the protesters in order to discredit them 
it reported last week that four people convicted of robbery or 
murder were sentenced to death in beijing and they also were said 
to have taken advantage of the turmoil to commit their crimes 
dozens of executions have been reported nationwide since the 
protests were crushed in june but just 12 were of known 
protesters hong kong newspapers have reported that dozens more 
protesters have been executed in secret 
executions in china are carried out with a bullet to the back of 
the head 
in other developments the government promised today it would 
honor contracts signed by two leading stateowned conglomerates 
that are being shut down in an attack on corruption 
the state administration for industry and commerce said two 
special teams were being formed to clear up the accounts of the 
kang hua development corp which is linked to senior leader deng 
xiaopings son and the china industry and commmerce economic 
development corp 
it said their contract would remain valid but did not say how 
these would be carried out while the companies books are 
undergoing close examination and their offices are being shut down 
the communist party politburo issued a sweeping order friday to 
shut down the companies and audit others as part of its most 
serious attack yet on endemic corruption in the party and 
government 
it made no specific charges against kang hua and china industry 
but kang hua was widely reported to have used its connection to a 
charity run by dengs son deng pufang to evade taxes 
it also was reported engaged in profiteering of scarce goods 
and the government ordered several of its offices shut down last 
year 
local party committees nationwide met over the weekend to 
discuss ways of implementing the politburo order the peoples 
daily said 
some were said to add further measures to the politburo ban on 
pleasure trips abroad giftgiving and banquets at the state 
expense use of imported cars by highranking officials and special 
food supplies for them 
the city of tianjin ordered its officials to stop buying or 
building homes at government expense 
central chinas hubei province ordered a halt to special holiday 
supplies of cigarettes and liquor for officials and said 
lunchrooms for officials should be converted to serve all their 
staff 
the local government pledges contained fascinating admissions of 
privileges enjoyed by officials and not previously acknowledged 
southwest chinas sichuan province for example ordered its 
officials to stop giving their children special work assignments 
help them to change jobs or travel abroad to study 
the party has been preoccupied with tightening discipline since 
it used troops to drive prodemocracy protesters out of central 
beijing killing hundreds of unarmed civilians 
the popularity of the prodemocracy movement dramatized public 
unhappiness with the partys leadership and wide dissatisfaction 
within its own ranks

usa today founder al neuharth says 
airlines should make the skies friendlier by bringing back shapely 
young sky girls but scores of the newspapers staffers 
dismissed his comments as bigoted and insulting 
todays edition of usa today carried a letter signed by more 
than 175 of the newspapers 426 newsroom employees saying they 
were offended outraged and embarrassed by neuharths column 
the newspaper also carried an interview with the head of the 
association of flight attendants who said union members were 
stunned by the former gannett co inc chairmans comments 
my feeling was that al neuharth is either a neanderthal or 
some sort of court jester said susan bianchisand 42 who added 
that she had been a flight attendant for 20 years i couldnt 
figure out whether he just hasnt been in touch with reality or 
hes just joking with us 
in a column last friday neuharth said he began taking 
commercial flights for the first time in 19 years after his recent 
retirement and didnt like what he found 
many of the young attractive enthusiastic female flight 
attendants then called stewardesses have been replaced by aging 
women who are tired of their jobs or by flighty young men who have 
trouble balancing a cup of coffee or tea he wrote 
if he were running an airline neuharth said he would ease 
todays cabin pressures for passengers by insisting on 
oldfashioned vital statistics for sky girls unmarried female 
nurses under age 25 measuring 5foot4 or less and weighing under 
115 pounds 
we say this is bigoted and insulting not only to flight 
attendants and nurses but also to the women and men who work for 
gannett the employee letter said 
bianchisand said neuharths column trivialized the work of 
flight attendants usa today noted that the column appeared on a 
day in which attendants on united airlines flight 232 described 
their roles in the crash in sioux city iowa in which 185 of the 
296 passengers survived

panicky poles stood in lines for hours 
today to stock up on supplies of meat and sugar the day before the 
government ends price controls and sends costs soaring 
also today it was announced that interior minister gen czeslaw 
kiszczak has been chosen the ruling communist partys candidate to 
become prime minister and head the next government 
kiszczak who represented the government in the april talks that 
led to the reinstatement of solidarity and a series of democratic 
reforms was picked by the communist party central committee on 
saturday the staterun pap news service said 
newly appointed party chief mieczyslaw f rakowski appeared 
before communist lawmakers today to urge kiszczaks candidacy pap 
said 
president wojciech jaruzelski was expected to formally nominate 
kiszczak his confidant to parliament later today assuming the 
candidacy did not meet opposition within the communist coalition 
if the coalition agrees on kiszczak his election would be 
assured because it holds a 299161 edge in the sejm parliaments 
lower house 
meanwhile consumers stood in line for hours to buy meat and 
sugar before price controls and rationing are lifted tuesday and 
costs soar 
the controversial food price move was endorsed by rakowski but 
criticized by the solidarity free trade union movement and some 
communist economists 
a critic of the plan politburo member wladyslaw baka said it 
could raise food prices fourfold and turn the public against 
reforms unless it is introduced more cautiously baka lost a policy 
fight to delay the plan at the weekend central committee plenum 
long lines formed in front of grocery stores in the capital 
today with people reporting standing in line two hours to buy 22 
pounds of sugar the maximum allowed lines for lowcost rationed 
meat were even longer 
the plan to eliminate meat rationing and price controls to 
encourage farmers to produce more underlines the growing complexity 
of polands political changes 
rakowski a pragmatist who gathered support from party 
conservatives to win election as party chief on saturday supports 
the bold reform step and got the party to endorse it 
solidarity the main opposition backs the reform generally but 
opposes it now because it feels the groundwork has not been laid 
it fears that when the alreadyhigh food prices rise they will fuel 
unrest and could lead to strikes 
communist party spokesman janusz bisztyga discussing the 
election today said rakowski was picked to lead the party because 
of his experience international stature and he is a very good 
fighter and wants to change the situation so that the party 
will get up from its knees 
the opposition newspaper gazeta wyborcza noted today that in the 
soviet union 110 morally and physically wornout members of the 
central committee recently were retired while in poland 
kubasiewicz and gorywoda were promoted 
the newspaper also sharply criticized the food price plan 
calling on authorities and legislators to put everything in 
order or things will blow up 
after his election saturday rakowski told fellow communists 
that the party is not looking for a quarrel with the opposition 
but we will fight back if provoked according to a text made 
public sunday 
pap said that under the new food program stores will be allowed 
to buy meat directly from farmers starting for whatever price they 
can negotiate ending an administrative price system and a system 
of official meatbuying points 
meat ration coupons which have allowed each person to buy five 
pounds of meat monthly from stateowned shops at controlled prices 
will be abolished consumers always could buy additional meat at 
higher prices from private stores but it was too expensive for 
many people 
rakowski has said farmers are withholding meat and grain from 
markets because the prices they get are insufficient 
the only food prices that will still be controlled are bread 
lowfat milk cottage cheese and milk formulas for infants 
the program contains some money to compensate consumers for 
the higher prices but not enough to make up for the price 
increases pap said it said details would be published tuesday 
at the time of rakowskis election two regional party leaders 
regarded as hardliners were named to the politburo as was a 
43yearold party secretary known as a reformer four veteran 
politburo members resigned 
it appeared that rakowski was attempting to balance various 
party factions within the politburo 
bisztyga explained the naming of two politicians regarded as 
hardliners warsaw party leader janusz kubasiewicz and katowice 
party chief manfred gorywoda to the partys ruling politburo as 
dictated by their political strength their organizations represent 
a third of the communists nationwide he said 
in polands freest elections in more than four decades last 
month the newly reinstated solidarity movement won all but one of 
the 261 parliamentary seats it was allowed to contest prompting 
the party to explore how it can start to rebuild public support

harvard law professor alan dershowitz 
argued with god as a boy studying the talmud in brooklyn ever 
since hes made a career out of challenging the powers that be 
now the defender of the civil rights of soviet refuseniks and 
us nazis has been vindicated in his clash with a federal judge 
over a book about the claus von bulow case in which he 
successfully defended the socialite accused of trying to kill his 
wife 
us district judge ronald lagueux barred dershowitz from his 
courtroom because of the 1986 book which castigated the rhode 
island judicial system but the outspoken attorney fought back 
and won 
rhode island chief justice thomas f fay said sunday he would 
not at least for now appoint a special prosecutor to investigate 
dershowitz as lagueux had requested 
dershowitz who is campaigning to get lagueux impeached said 
the judges call for an investigation was retaliation for the 
private censure lagueux received last december after dershowitz 
filed disciplinary charges against him 
i dont have much respect for authority i fought with the 
rabbis and with the teachers in college dershowitz 50 said in 
a recent interview 
the tiff with lagueux began with the publication of dershowitz 
book reversal of fortune about his part in the acquittal of 
von bulow 
mrs von bulow has been in a coma at columbia presbyterian 
hospital in new york for nine years von bulow was convicted of 
attempted murder in his first trial in 1982 but that conviction 
was overturned and he was acquitted at retrial in 1985 
four days out of five dershowitz teaches on the fifth he 
practices law and generally makes a public fuss in defense of civil 
liberties 
i see this as part of my mission he said thats why im 
willing to degrade myself and go on the mort downey show 
an untweedy 5foot9 in mustache glasses and a willful head of 
wiry red hair dershowitz has appeared on talk shows hosted by 
downey phil donahue and oprah winfrey and on macneillehrer 60 
minutes and david letterman he writes a weekly column for 45 
daily newspapers 
his staunch orthodox defense of civil liberties has led him to 
take unpopular cases 
among his clients were a jewish defense league bombmaker who 
killed a girl us nazis the ku klux klan and porn star harry 
reems of deep throat fame he helped defend cia whistleblower 
frank snepp soviet dissident anatoly shcharansky patricia hearst 
proplo actress vanessa redgrave and spy jonathan pollard 
i dont need the bill of rights im a wealthy educated 
powerful tenured professor dershowitz said im out there 
protecting people who need the bill of rights 
a graduate of the yale university law school dershowitz joined 
the harvard faculty in 1965 at age 25 and was given a full 
professorship at 28 
the cachet of yale and harvard aside he has a knack for 
irritating some people and his willingness to enter the public 
forum leads to questions about his motives 
boston magazine pounded dershowitz last year in a biting profile 
that put him on trial for being a publicity hound 
the guy is so obsessed with being a celebrity figure that 
hell do and say anything to get notoriety to me that doesnt make 
for a good person and it doesnt make for a good lawyer said 
vincent morgera a lawyer in providence ri 
supporters of dershowitz are just as passionate 
in addition to having the mind of a steel trap he has an 
incredible legal imagination and can figure a way out of any legal 
problem hes one of the premier legal strategists in the united 
states said harvey silvergate a criminal lawyer in boston who 
was a student of dershowitz and later a colleague on the harvard 
faculty 
silvergate added the only person i know who is able to 
intimidate him is his mother

zhou yang one of the communist partys leading 
literary arbiters for nearly 60 years and in his old age a 
champion of artistic freedom died today he was 81 
zhou had been hospitalized for six years the official xinhua 
news agency said without specifying his ailment or the cause of 
death 
it said top party officials including politburo standing 
committee member li ruihuan visited the hospital to offer 
condolences to zhous family 
from his youth as a leftist literary critic in wartime shanghai 
through the cultural revolution and other political campaigns zhou 
was a key player in the ideological battles that divided modern 
chinese artists such as the purpose of art and whether it should 
serve the party 
in his youth he came down on the side of strong party control 
but as chairman of the statesponsored china federation of literary 
and art circles from 1979 until this year he advocated greater 
artistic freedom 
in 1983 he aroused controversy with an essay entitled 
alienation in which he said it was possible for people in a 
socialist society to feel socially and politically alienated and 
that socialist leaders could become alienated from the people they 
were to represent 
he also sided with those who said literature should reflect the 
ordinary lives and emotions of human beings rather than simply 
convey socialist lessons 
he was harshly criticized when party conservatives launched a 
campaign later that year against spiritual pollution or 
alleged bourgeois ideas he was forced to write a public 
selfcriticism in which he said his essay could have led people to 
lose confidence in the future of socialism 
i have betrayed the party and the peoples trust he said 
he was restored to favor in 1984 when the party newspaper the 
peoples daily said that despite his mistakes zhou was an 
outstanding marxist theoretician 
over his long career zhou also took part in attacks on other 
intellectuals he led a purge of the poet hu feng as an alleged 
counterrevolutionary in 1955 and of the novelist ding ling as 
antiparty in 1957 in the 1930s he fought bitterly with lu 
xun chinas most famous modern writer over lus opposition to a 
party order that all writing take as its theme national defense 
against the japanese invasion 
zhou was born in 1907 in central chinas hunan province under 
the name zhou qiying he attended university in shanghai then the 
center of chinas intellectual avantegarde and later studied in 
japan he joined the party in 1932 
he held various influential posts in the cultural field during 
the 1950s and early 1960s including vice minister of culture he 
was purged in 1966 at the onset of the farleftist cultural 
revolution as were most intellectuals he was rehabilitated in 
1977

directors of two arts centers are protesting 
the potential loss of 250000 in annual federal grants if a 
senatepassed measure banning government aid for works judged 
obscene becomes law 
the institute for contemporary art in philadelphia said it could 
lose about 175000 for each of the next five years because it 
organized a controversial exhibit by robert mapplethorpe who died 
of aids earlier this year 
spokeswoman nancy burd said a 500000 federal grant to aid in 
the institutes move to a new building next year at the university 
of pennsylvania may also be threatened 
last weeks senate action also places in jeopardy a 75000 
annual national endowment for the arts grant that helps support an 
artist fellowship program at the southeastern center for 
contemporary art in winstonsalem nc 
the center was targeted by the measures sponsor sen jesse 
helms rnc because it used federal funds to sponsor a photo 
exhibition by andres serrano that included a picture of a crucifix 
submerged in a container of the artists urine 
both centers are seeking to muster support against the proposed 
federal funding ban which would last five years 
both these institutions are really being called for punishment 
for doing our job doing exactly what were supposed to do ted 
potter director of the north carolina center said in an interview 
he described the centers mandate as challenging peoples way 
of looking and seeing and thinking about critical issues of art 
culture and society 
the funding ban amendment was tacked on to a 171 million nea 
appropriation approved by the senate on wednesday it would bar nea 
support for obscene and indecent materials including but not 
limited to depictions of sadomasochism homoeroticism the 
exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sex acts 
it will be up to a housesenate conference committee to 
determine whether the amendment should remain in the final bill 
passed by congress 
helms said cutting off grants to the pennsylvania and north 
carolina centers would certainly prevent them misusing federal 
funds for the next five years 
but supporters of the philadelphia institute argued that it had 
followed nea guidelines 
in applying for nea funding to support the mapplethorpe show 
the institute provided the nea with complete information on the 
nature of the artists work including slides and was granted 
funding in accordance with established procedures said sheldon 
hackney president of the university of pennsylvania which helps 
support the center

the senate is aiming for a defense bill that 
closely resembles the blueprint sought by president bush unlike 
the house version that rips apart the administrations strategic 
weapons programs 
in a rush to complete its work before the recess that begins 
friday congress tackles a full plate of appropriations bills this 
week with the senate trying to produce a defense package that 
serves as a counterbalance to the house version 
in final action late thursday the democraticcontrolled house 
approved a 295 billion defense bill that severely curtails 
production of the b2 stealth bomber slashes 18 billion from the 
star wars budget and restores two planes the f14d tomcat jet 
fighter and v22 osprey that bush planned to kill 
the last cut came as alabama republican william dickinson joined 
forces with massachusetts liberal democrat barney frank and 
succeeded in eliminating all 100 million earmarked for the 
midgetman missile 
yesterday was not the houses most memorable moment bush 
told reporters friday but were going to keep fighting on for 
what we believe in 
the president said he is counting on the senate to produce a 
bill that keeps white house defense priorities in order the 
chairman of the senate armed services committee democrat sam nunn 
of georgia has given every indication he will do that 
we are watching the strategic position of the administration 
unwind step by step on the floor of the house nunn said thursday 
night as the house stripped all money for the midgetman it is 
important that we not emasculate this program 
if the senate does not come out with a reasonable budget on 
all strategic programs then we are going to be going to conference 
in a hopeless situation he added 
to date the senate has followed the administrations line 
approving an amendment that largely endorses the b2 bomber program 
and makes a modest cut of 300 million from bushs 47 billion b2 
request 
on thursday the senate narrowly turned aside an amendment to 
freeze research and development of the star wars antimissile 
shield bush has requested 49 billion for the star wars program 
bush also expressed the administrations desire to work with the 
chairman of the house armed services committee democrat les aspin 
of wisconsin who does not want to see the defense bill gutted 
according to the president 
prior to committee action on the bill aspin urged his 
democratic and republican colleagues to accept defense secretary 
dick cheneys procurement budget without any addons 
while the budget may not be perfect its a darn good product 
especially given the 39 days dick cheney had to put it 
together aspin had told the procurement subcommittee which 
narrowly accepted the chairmans argument 
but shortly after the house voted 261162 to adopt the defense 
bill aspin assessed the situation 
we got a michael dukakis defense bill the wisconsin 
democrat told reporters referring to the massachusetts governor 
who lost the 1988 presidential election to bush 
no midgetman no rail mx big cuts in sdi and slow up the 
b2 bomber aspin said in reference to dukakis campaign pledges 
house and senate conferees will meet after the august recess to 
craft a final defense bill which also includes 10 billion for the 
department of energy for a 305 billion package 
another armed services panel member rep john spratt dsc 
said too much was being made of the house version which was merely 
a position in the process 
the final defense bill will include some restrictions on the b2 
but not the version adopted by the house plus a flattening out 
of sdi money and resurrection of a small amount of funding for 
midgetman spratt said 
house speaker thomas s foley said housesenate conferees 
could alter on the margins the decisions made yesterday but the 
broad outline of these decisions will survive 
in other action this week 
the senate judiciary committee is expected to vote tuesday on 
the nomination of william lucas as the nations chief civil rights 
enforcer bushs choice for the post has come under attack from the 
national association for the advancement of colored people and 
other civil rights groups who complain that lucas lacks experience 
the senate considers a compromise savings and loan bailout bill 
that would balloon the federal budget deficit a housesenate 
conference committee finished work last week on the plan that would 
involve spending 166 billion including interest over the next 10 
years the vast majority of it from taxpayers the conference 
committee rejected bushs complex plan to exclude 50 billion in 
rescue spending from the deficit and senators warn that 
republicans could block the arrangement in the senate 
the house and senate consider bills expanding the governments 
borrowing authority through oct 31 by 70 billion the amount is a 
temporary extension of the 28 trillion debt ceiling

the proiranian group holding a us 
marine colonel hostage said it planned to hang him today unless 
israel frees an influential shiite moslem cleric captured three 
days ago the deadline passed with no immediate word from the 
captors 
in jerusalem defense minister yitzhak rabin of israel proposed 
trading all his countrys shiite moslem captives for all captured 
israeli soldiers and foreign hostages held by shiite groups in 
lebanon rabin made the proposal in an announcement broadcast on 
staterun israel radio 
shiite groups in lebanon are believed to hold three israeli 
soldiers and 17 foreigners including nine americans israeli 
security sources estimate 50 to 60 shiite moslems from lebanon are 
held in israeli prisons 
the group calling itself the organization of the oppressed on 
earth said it would kill proven spy lt col william r higgins 
at 3 pm 8 am edt if sheik abdul karim obeid were not freed 
government sources in jerusalem have noted that israel has 
repeatedly stated that it would not bow to such threats 
in tehran iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati condemned 
both the death threat and the kidnapping of obeid 
we condemn the kidnapping of sheik obeid and we ask the 
international community to put pressure on the zionist regime to 
release him velayati told foreign reporters at a news conference 
the threat against higgins has nothing to do with us however 
we condemn any kind of kidnapping or death threat he added 
his comments came a day after another leading iranian official 
defended the threat against higgins 
obeid is the reputed spiritual leader of the shiite moslem 
hezbollah militia in south lebanon the umbrella group for factions 
believed to be holding 17 foreign hostages in lebanon nine of them 
americans 
lebanese security sources and israeli officials say obeid played 
a role in the kidnapping of higgins last year but obeid denies it 
in sundays statement which was delivered to a western news 
agency in beirut higgins captors said carrying out the death 
sentence will be our first response to the stupid israeli 
aggression and the flagrant american support that proves us 
complicity in the crime 
hezbollah and the syrianbacked mainstream shiite moslem amal 
militia called a general strike in lebanon today to protest obeids 
abduction 
businesses were closed throughout moslem west beirut and its 
shiitepopulated southern slums as well as the cities of sidon 
tyre nabatieh and baalbek in south and east lebanon 
in jerusalem earlier in the day deputy prime minister shimon 
peres defended israels decision to abduct obeid whom israeli 
officials have accused of instigating attacks on israel peres said 
israeli officials hope he can be swapped for three israeli soldiers 
missing in lebanon since 1986 and believed held by hezbollah 
i think that anything that prevents terror attacks against 
israel the kidnapping of our soldiers must be done within the 
confines of law when there is a state of law peres said 
unfortunately in the case of lebanon it is a wild country and 
israel must defend itself he added 
of the death threat he said this isnt the first time they 
are threatening 
he would not say what israels response to the death threat 
would be i am not willing to relate either to details or to 
threats peres said 
secretary of state james a baker iii today condemned the threat 
to kill higgins as outrageous uncivilized unconscionable 
behavior 
there really can be no explanation for it and no excuse for 
it he told reporters in paris as he headed into a second round 
of meetings at an international conference on cambodia 
the group holding higgins said in a dec 12 statement that it 
had sentenced the marine to death and said he made full 
confessions about his espionage activities 
on sunday the groups statement said we shall carry out by 
hanging the death sentence handed down against proven spy higgins 
at exactly 3 pm 8 am edt monday if sheik abdul karim obeid 
and his two brethren have not been freed by then 
israeli commandos stole into the southern lebanese village of 
jibchit early friday kidnapped obeid from his apartment and flew 
him to israel in a helicopter 
his cousin ahmed obeid and a friend majid fahs also were 
seized lebanese police said a neighbor of obeids was shot to 
death by troops when he opened his door during the kidnapping 
israel described ahmed obeid and majid fahs as assistants of 
obeid 
higgins 44 of danville ky was serving as head of an 
observer group attached to the un peacekeeping force in south 
lebanon when he was seized feb 17 1988 his captors accused him 
of spying for the cia 
sundays typewritten arabic statement was not accompanied by a 
picture of higgins the usual sign of authenticity but it appeared 
typed on the same machine and the same paper as earlier statements 
israeli analysts today questioned whether higgins was alive 
before obeid was captured 
during the negotiations which are likely to open in the wake 
of the kidnapping of sheikh obeid higgins captors will have to 
prove he is indeed alive military analyst zeev schiff wrote in 
the daily haaretz 
obeid has denied involvement in higgins abduction or in 
hezbollah 
but israeli sources say obeid was involved in the operation to 
kidnap higgins and held the marine for a time in his home one 
source said obeid was expected to provide information on higgins 
on sunday a leading iranian official defended the threat 
against higgins 
it is very natural that the islamic clergy and militant 
groups throughout the world will take action against the interests 
of israel and the united states iranian interior minister ali 
akbar mohtashemi told a news conference in tehran they will not 
allow them to live comfortably 
he named proiranian hezbollah as one of the moslem groups that 
should retaliate 
asked about the fate of hostages in lebanon mohtashemi said 
the issue of the hostages has no direct connection with us 
an iranian newspaper said obeids abduction jeopardized moves to 
free the hostages the hostage held longest is terry anderson 
chief middle east correspondent for the associated press he was 
abducted march 16 1985 
the zionists have introduced a new threat to humanitarian 
efforts to release hostages in lebanon the tehran times said in 
an editorial sunday

three reputed mafia figures who escaped 
conviction on state charges of murdering a new york city detective 
have been found guilty in federal court of racketeering in the 1986 
slaying 
frederico fritzy giovanelli 56 steven maltese 57 and 
carmine buddy gualtiere 55 of new york city were convicted 
sunday of violating the racketeer influenced and corrupt 
organizations act

tony venditti can finally rest in peace burke said after 
the 11week trial 
the defendants were charged with murder but the first trial in 
1987 ended in a hung jury and the second in 1988 resulted in 
gualtieres acquittal and a deadlock over charges against 
giovanelli and maltese 
prosecutors then turned to federal court charging the men under 
the rico act 
it demonstrates our resolve to use every legal means available 
to us to bring to justice those responsible for the murder of a 
police officer said us attorney benito romano 
it also demonstrates the extraordinary value of the rico 
statutes to allow us in this case to place in context the murder 
of police officer venditti as part of a pattern of crime engaged in 
to protect a largescale gambling operation 
the jury found the three guilty of racketeering loansharking 
interstate travel in aid of the racketeering enterprise and tax 
charges under the racketeering charges the three also were 
convicted of murder and attempted murder 
the three reputed associates of the genovese crime family did 
not know venditti was a police officer and were afraid they were 
going to be ripped off romano said 
the verdict came on the fifth day of deliberations 
giovanelli faces 70 years in prison maltese 75 years and 
gualtiere 50 each could be fined more than 1 million sentencing

top officials in the department of housing and 
urban development should have to keep a log of every visitor and 
telephone call as a means of discouraging influencepeddling that 
pervaded the agency a former senator proposed today 
some will say that requiring such reports as a matter of law 
is too burdensome is an interference with privacy or is 
micromanaging former sen william proxmire dwis told a house 
panel keep in mind these are public officials they are on the 
public payroll they are dealing with hundreds of millions of 
dollars of the publics money 
proxmire who was chairman of a senate subcommittee with 
responsibility for overseeing the department acknowledged today he 
was chagrined that i had no idea what was going on at hud until 
congressional hearings began in recent months 
witnesses before the house government operations subcommittee on 
housing and employment have said that hud contracts worth millions 
of dollars were awarded on the basis of political influence and 
that some programs were monitored so poorly that people just 
pocketed government money with no one to stop them 
hud secretary jack kemp who took office this year with a pledge 
to clean up the department has estimated that the corruption has 
cost the government 2 billion 
many of the deals now under investigation involved former hud 
officials or wellconnected republicans who used their influence at 
the top levels of the agency to gain approval for projects in which 
they had some financial interest 
proxmire said his proposal requiring reports on such meetings 
be given to congress and the news media would force hud officials 
to make an immediate public accounting of their actions in the 
future 
im not asking that these conferences be made public or that 
congressional staffers or the press sit in when the department 
secretary or other decisionmakers meet to discuss how where and 
how much of the public money to spend proxmire said 
i am asking that the secretary and others automatically notify 
the responsible people in congress and interested media people 
within 24 hours of the time of any discussion or written 
correspondence relating to spending the public money 
the subcommittee later today was to hear from maurice barksdale 
a former hud assistant secretary and john knapp former general 
counsel to the department knapp also testified before the panel on 
may 25

lebanon 
after he was kidnapped his uncle said higgins had fulfilled his 
goal of making his family proud 
he loves his country said delbert eagle of lancaster ky 
he is capable of standing up as well as an ordinary man will 
under the circumstances i dont think they could bring enough 
pressure or pain to cause him to betray his country in any way 
eagle died four months ago 
the shiite moslems holding higgins had said sunday they would 
hang him unless israel released a shiite moslem clergyman kidnapped 
friday by israeli commandos today the group claimed it had

here is the text of pesident bushs reaction to 
reports that shiite moslem terrorists hanged marine l col william 
higgins in lebanon today bush was speaking to the national 
governors association 
i want to comment on a very disturbing report that weve just 
heard there are unconfirmed reports that colonel higgins has 
indeed been executed 
i had planned to go on out to nevada for another appearance 
today and then to go to oklahoma tonight but this matter is of 
such concern to me and to all of you and to the american people 
that i think its appropriate that i go back to washington 
whether the report is true or not i know i speak for all here 
when i try to express to the american people the sense of outrage 
that we all feel about this kind of brutality this uncalledfor 
terrorism 
this was a young american colonel serving in an international 
force and it is incumbent on all of us to try to rectify this 
situation if at all possible 
i have no more to share with you on this we have not been 
able to confirm this horrible report but i will go back to 
washington and convene our top national security people and first 
establish to the best of our ability if the report is true and 
then figure out what might conceivably be done 
so im sorry to bring to this meeting a message of that 
nature the bad news but i felt you would want to know about it

overall use of illicit drugs dropped 
sigificantly in the united states since 1985 but the number of 
heavy cocaine users jumped according to a government survey 
released today 
the 1988 national household survey on drug abuse found a 
decrease of 37 percent from a 1985 survey in the number of people 
who said they had used illicit drugs within a month of being 
surveyed 
however the survey found a 33 percent increase in the number of 
people using cocaine once a week or more and a 19 percent increase 
in the number of people using the drug daily or almost daily 
mindful of the destructive power of drugs and those who peddle 
them this survey should not be viewed as a declaration of success 
but as a rallying point for sustained and invigorated demand and 
supply reduction initiatives said louis sullivan secretary of 
the department of health and human services 
while we celebrate our impressive gains let us resolve to 
reinforce and build on them he said 
most use of most drugs by most americans overall drug use 
is off sharply but cocaine addiction has dramatically 
intensified said william j bennett director of federal drug 
control policy 
we are not out of the woods yet not by a long shot the 
reductions in american drug use are not the whole story as anyone 
who watches television reads a newspaper or lives in a city can 
see for himself drug crime is up drug trafficking is up drug 
deaths are up drug emergencies in our hospitals are up all since 
1985 and much of this can be explained in one word crack 
bennett said 
the survey covers the population age 12 and older living in 
households in the 48 contiguous states the results are based on 
personal interviews and written questions answered by 8814 people 
the survey does not include homeless people people living in 
military installations dormitories and institutions such as 
hospitals and prisons 
the survey conducted last fall is the ninth in a series that 
began in 1971 it is sponsored by the national institute on drug 
abuse an hhs agency 
sullivan said that despite assurances of confidentiality for 
those in the survey there is some likely underreporting but 
he said the numbers are reliable in showing trends in drug use 
i wouldnt bet the rent on the absolute numbers but i would on 
the trends he said 
sullivan credited national media campaigns and school and 
communitybased drugabuse prevention programs for the decline in 
casual drug use if that decline can be sustained he said it in 
time will also influence the number of addicts 
these figures show that we can have an effect and it shows 
that what were doing is working and that is cause for 
encouragement as well as redoubling and rededication of efforts and 
resources he said 
bennett and sullivan said more resources are needed to treat 
drug addiction 
according to the survey the number of people who used 
marijuana cocaine or any other illicit drug within the month 
previous to being surveyed dropped from 23 million in 1985 to 145 
million in 1988 
those who used an illicit drug within the previous year fell 
from 37 million to 28 million a decline of almost 25 percent 
sullivan said some of the cocaine statistics were encouraging 
the number of people who reported using the drug within the 
previous month dropped by 50 percent from 58 million in 1985 to 
29 million last year and the number who had used the drug in the 
previous year fell 33 percent from 12 million to 8 million 
but the survey indicated the number of people who used cocaine 
once a week or more grew from 647000 in 1985 to 862000 last year 
the number of daily or almostdaily users rose from 246000 in 1985 
to 292000 last year

president bush in a speech overshadowed by 
reports of the execution of an american hostage in lebanon today 
summoned state governors to a september summit to search for ways 
to improve the nations educational performance 
bush tendered the invitation to the sept 2728 meeting in a 
speech at the national governors association summer meeting here 
then cut short a planned twoday speechmaking trip to return to 
washington to check on the execution reports and figure out what 
might conceivably be done in response 
the president spoke soon after shiite moslem captors of marine 
lt col william higgins claimed they had hanged the officer who 
was assigned to a united nations peacekeeping force in lebanon in 
retaliation for israels kidnapping last week of a moslem cleric 
and two aides from south lebanon 
from chicago bushs originally had planned to fly to las vegas 
nev to speak before the disabled american veterans and to 
oklahoma city where he was to address a convention of the 
fraternal order of police on tuesday 
instead the president headed back to the capital after 
delivering his speech to the governors and taking questions from 
them 
in his remarks bush predicted that the education summit will be 
an historic meeting only the third time in history a president 
has convened a gathering of the governors 
the education department has already been providing pilot funds 
for school districts trying school reforms embraced by the 
governors association 
in his speech bush did not offer any new financial aid to 
education saying only that federal dollars should be targeted to 
those most in need he reiterated support of choice for 
parents in where they want to send their children to school 
the president also enlisted the governors help in combating 
other social problems from crime to drug abuse to welfare 
dependency that he portrayed as undermining americas progress 
he said he shares with the chief executives of the 50 states 
common challenges and responsibilities 
to cure our nation of illiteracy drug abuse and crime we 
must act in tandem president with governor and governor with 
mayor up and down the line he said in short we must find our 
collective will as a nation 
today we do not meet in a spirit of immediate crisis the 
nation is sound bush continued but the decline of our 
educational system the threat of crime and drugs the economic 
dependency of so many these problems threaten to endanger the 
very leadership position of america in the next century 
a nation in which a half of our youth is ignorant of 
geography in which drugs are rampant in which a substantial 
proportion of the population knows little hope such a nation will 
not long remain competitive he said 
improving our schools driving out drugs and bringing hope and 
opportunity to those who need it most these are issues of our 
national wellbeing even our national security he said 
bush promised during last years campaign to convene an 
education summit and discussed it with the governors executive 
committee at the white house in may 
only twice before have the nations governors met en masse with 
the president on an issue of vital national importance bush said 
the first was a conference on conservation called by theodore 
roosevelt and the second a meeting convened by franklin d 
roosevelt on how to stem the financial crisis of the great 
depression bush said 
together we can find ways to strengthen our schools to 
enlarge opportunities and to improve our nations educational 
performance he said 
bush announced that he has instructed his domestic policy 
council to give the governors flexibility in the rules now being 
drafted to carry out welfare reforms enacted last year 
the importance of education to the economy was underscored 
sunday by federal reserve chairman alan greenspan who told the 
governors the major capital of the next century is going to be 
minds that produce ideas 
more and higher quality education must be presumed to be 
crucial in americas competition with our industrial partners for 
economic world leadership greenspan said 
congress has been slow to act on bushs proposed 12 billion 
anticrime package bush wants to build more prisons and beef up 
the ranks of federal prosecutors and agents 
the administrations drug policy director william j bennett 
is still formulating a new national strategy to combat drug abuse 
by law the administration has until early september to produce 
that battle plan

followers of santeria went to federal court today 
to challenge a ban on animal sacrifice arguing the practice is 
integral to their afrocuban religion 
jorge duarte a lawyer for the church of the lukumi babalu aye 
said the hialeah city ordinance violates followers freedom of 
religion 
but an attorney for the city countered that the ordinance is a 
permissible effort to regulate the killing of animals and disposal 
of their bodies 
there is a legal governmental need for prevention of cruelty 
to animals and prevention of disease said richard garrett 
animals are being left throughout the city 
he also told us district judge eugene p spellman that the 
sight of smeared blood causes children to be more violent 
as many as 25000 people in south florida are followers of 
santeria whose rites include the killing of chickens birds and 
goats as offerings to the gods 
three city ordinances passed in 1987 ban the ritual sacrifice or 
slaughter of any living creature violations carry a fine of 500 
or 60 days in jail 
duarte who is being assisted by the american civil liberties 
union compared santeria rites with jewish dietary laws that are

israeli officials said today they received no 
immediate confirmation of a claim from a moslem shiite group that 
it executed a us marine hostage to retaliate for the israeli 
abduction of a moslem cleric 
they also reiterated their offer made earlier today to trade all 
israels shiite moslem captives for all captured israeli soldiers 
and foreign hostages held by shiite groups in lebanon 
a proiranian organization of the oppressed on earth said it 
executed lt col william r higgins today after a deadline passed 
for their demand that the abducted cleric be released 
higgins was head of an unarmed un observer group in lebanon 
when he was abducted in february 1988 in south lebanon 
at this point we have no confirmation that indeed colonel 
higgins was murdered said avi pazner spokesman for prime 
minister yitzhak shamir 
we have to be very cautious with a possible reaction because 
you remember a year ago the same organization said that they 
executed col higgins after the accidental shootingdown of an 
iranian airplane by the us navy 
so we will have to look for further evidence to confirm where 
such an odious and criminal act has been perpetrated he told the 
associated press 
sources in lebanon have said the united nations received 
unconfirmed reports earlier this year that higgins was killed after 
an iranian airliner was shot down by a us warship on july 3 1988 
spokesmen for israels defense and foreign ministries refused to 
comment immediately on the report of higgins death 
in making the israeli offer today defense minister yitzhak 
rabin said israel repeats its call for the release of israeli 
and other hostages held by shiite groups in lebanon israel is 
offering to trade prisoners detainees and hostages 
his statement to reporters in tel aviv read from a prepared 
text was also broadcast on staterun israel radio pazner later 
said the offer was made on behalf of the government 
according to this proposal all the israeli prisoners and 
foreign hostages held by shiite groups in lebanon would be swapped 
for all the shiite prisoners kept by israel including sheik abdel 
karim obeid jawad kasfi and others rabin said 
he said such an exchange would be conducted through the 
international red cross 
pazner said the offer stands despite the claim that higgins had 
been executed 
obeid is an influential shiite moslem cleric kidnapped by 
israeli commandos friday in south lebanon and kasfi is another 
lebanese shiite seized by israeli forces in lebanon last december 
obeid is the reputed spiritual leader of the shiite moslem 
hezbollah militia in south lebanon the umbrella group for factions 
believed to be holding 17 foreign hostages in lebanon nine are 
american 
security sources estimate 50 to 60 shiite moslems from lebanon 
are held in israeli prisons 
the israelibacked south lebanon army militia which helps 
patrol israels selfdeclared security zone in south lebanon holds 
about 300 shiites in a prison at khiam in south lebanon it was not 
immediately clear if this group would be part of the deal 
deputy prime minister shimon peres had said earlier today that 
israeli officials hoped obeid could be swapped for three israeli 
soldiers missing in lebanon since 1986 and believed held by 
hezbollah

us customs commissioner william von raab 
took the occasion of the custom services 200th anniversary today 
to announce his resignation and take some parting shots at those in 
government he considers not as committed as he to the war on drugs 
when we exposed the tinhorned dictator manuel noriega of 
panama as a drug king the mildest phrase some used on us was 
outofcontrol von raab told customs officials gathered near 
the washington monument 
they attacked us not him but now they agree said von 
raab who was denied reappointment to the post he has held for 
eight years and has been harshly critical of government colleagues 
in recent interviews 
when dea drug enforcement administration agent kiki camarena 
was murdered in mexico we showed this countrys outrage by 
cracking down hard on the border mexicos foreign minister 
sepulveda attacked us some in our own government actually joined 
him von raab said 
if we dared to speak out it was because those in our own 
government were too scared to speak up 
von raab who said his resignation was effective at midnight 
tonight was praised at the 200th anniversary celebration by 
lawmakers on opposite sides of the political spectrum for his 
outspokenness on the drug war and the infighting between government 
agencies 
sen jesse helms rnc called von raab a man of courage 
integrity and forthrightness while rep charles rangel dny 
said von raab leaves a tradition and a standard for the rest of 
us to follow 
the customs service included in its press package for the 
anniversary celebration a copy of von raabs letter of resignation 
sent today to president bush in which he blasted a failure of the 
federal government to work together in the drug war 
while praising william j bennett director of the office of 
national drug control policy as a courageous man von raab 
said he was deeply concerned by what i have witnessed within the 
bureaucracy over the past months 
the political jockeying backstabbing and malaise that has 
crept into the current effort have frustrated me and are 
threatening the antidrug efforts and successes of the past years 
von raab said in the letter 
he also took a sharp hit at the treasury department which 
oversees the customs service saying that many treasury officials 
have shown at best a distinct lack of interest in the drug 
efforts of the customs service and at worst an outright demotion 
of customs in relation to other treasury priorities 
treasury secretary nicholas brady who spoke last at the 
ceremony did not mention von raabs imminent departure focusing 
instead on the hard work by customs employees cooperation among 
cabinet members in the antidrug effort and saying that the drug war 
is a war we are going to win 
at the close of the ceremony von raab shook hands with many of 
the officials gathered on stage but not with brady 
at a postceremony news conference von raab called brady an 
honorable man but said im quitting obviously because im 
not getting along with secretary brady 
von raab said he couldnt understand why brady did not mention 
him in his remarks and that he had toned down his own comments at 
the request of the treasury department 
he said he had heard rumors he would be fired possibly in 
response to similar blasts he has made at his department and others 
in media interviews in previous weeks 
asked later whether it wasnt disingenuous of him to claim he 
couldnt understand bradys lack of warmth toward him in light of 
his statements von raab simply shrugged smiled and walked away

a 3weekold national dock workers strike fizzled 
monday as more workers returned to their jobs after employers 
threatened to fire those who stayed away 
in bristol however 480 dock workers voted to continue to stay 
out over government plans to abolish guaranteed lifelong employment 
port employers said the returns meant that 3668 or 57 percent 
of those affected by the job guarantee program were working and 
2741 remained on strike forty of the 60 ports affected by the 
strike were operating normally they said 
clearly more than 50 percent of dockers are back at work they 
have voted with their feet and i hope the transport and general 
workers union will heed their wishes and call off this strike 
said nick finney director of the national association of port 
employers 
but opposition labor party lawmaker michael meacher said sunday 
the reason is not lack of support for the cause but the 
intimidation and blackmail involved in threats of sackings 
the swing away from the strike came after union leaders voted 
friday to intensify the dispute and try to get more workers to 
rejoin the strike 
about 750 workers at the key ports of southampton and hull 
defied their national leaders to return to the waterfronts monday 
associated british ports one of britains biggest dock owners 
had threatened to fire southampton hull and fleetwood workers if 
they stayed away monday 
the union leadership was due to meet tuesday to discuss tactics

twice a day state rep dennis dutko picks 
up a pay phone in the ingham county jail and calls his office to 
check on the latest from the capitol or his constituents 
since his oneyear sentence began may 24 for a third drunken 
driving conviction the eightterm democrat has represented his 
suburban detroit district from his jail cell 
even his staff questions how effective he is from behind bars 
because he doesnt have a vote to tell you that he does have 
an impact on the house would be to distort the situation dutko 
aide paul mendelsohn said 
upon conviction the 45yearold bachelor was stripped of his 
chairmanship of the house committee on colleges and universities 
and the chairmanship of a subcommittee on longterm and 
supplemental medicare insurance 
a week after being jailed dutko said he would resign july 1 he 
then reneged saying he would wait until the legislature returns to 
lansing on sept 15 after a recess that began last fridy 
meanwhile attorneys are trying to appeal his convictions 
dutko still receives his 42670 annual salary but has said he 
will donate it to alcohol treatment programs while hes in jail 
the michigan legislature is a fulltime job and he had no other 
employment 
dutkos house colleagues urged him to step down after he was 
jailed but they have avoided trying to oust him apparently 
reluctant to break ranks 
my view is hes an embarrassment to the city said gop 
precinct delegate william sears who started an effort to have 
dutko recalled the city has been without a voice in lansing he 
did not even participate in the state budget 
but the recall petition drive has suffered from a lack of 
interest a dozen people showed up for the first informational 
meeting 
state attorney general frank kelley says that because dutko was 
convicted of a misdemeanor instead of a felony no state law forces 
him to quit the legislature 
dutko is believed to be the nations only legislator holding 
onto his job while serving a jail sentence according to rich 
jones director of legislative programs for the national conference 
of state legislatures in denver 
mendelsohn and another aide darren campbell sign their own 
names when responding to letters written to dutkos office they 
also are producing a district newsletter dutko used to write 
weve been handed a lot of control over what happens in the 
office mendelsohn said dutko refused comment 
paper work and briefing material must be mailed to dutko the 
only handdelivered packages he can accept contain white socks and 
underwear 
the michigan chapter of mothers against drunk driving and a 
small faction of constituents circulating the recall petition have 
been vocal about dutkos actions 
but most people express little interest in the case 
its something that people have been reading about but its 
not something they are upset about said michael raveane editor 
of the warren weekly distributed free to 60000 homes 
raveane says a majority of letters to the editor on dutkos 
incarceration have been sympathetic 
i dont condone what hes doing but i dont like to see his 
career ruined over it said tom calder 29 an attorney if he 
cant do his job properly from jail he should give it up but its 
a shame he would have to give it up that way 
dutkos 30 minutes of visiting time per week usually is reserved 
for his mother phyllis house speaker lewis dodak and some other 
colleagues also have visited 
like any other inmate dutko has unlimited phone access as long 
as the calls are local or collect

welcome on monday and urged him to be aggressive as head of the 
national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
the average noaa administrator has been chosen because he 
could keep his mouth shut i hope you will get excited sen 
ernest f hollings dsc told the university of rhode island 
professor 
knauss told the committee on commerce science and 
transportation that he hopes to press a broad oceancoastal 
initiative and to encourage research on global warming the ozone 
hole and other atmospheric problems 
never have noaas responsibilities been more important than 
they are today for an earth scientist these are exciting 
times as we try to understand and predict the ecological 
consequences of the actions of the worlds rapidly increasing 
population knauss told the committee 
scientific research on the effects of the alaskan oil spill 
could last as long as five years knauss confirmed 
sen ted stevens ralaska urged him to give close attention to 
the costs of such work with the aim of making sure that those 
responsible for spills are charged for the costs 
noaa scientists have done an excellent job in assisting in

endowments and particularly the administration interested in your 
endeavors hollings encouraged knauss 
hollings said he hopes that the nomination of knauss to head 
noaa can be voted on this week

as the tour bus swung through town a 
guide pointed out sites of historical significance a gas station 
with freestanding pumps roadside cabins outlined in pink neon and 
a driveup hot dog stand 
conventional historic sites barely got a second glance the 
gawkers were historic preservation experts attending a conference 
on roadside architecture and commercial archaeology 
archaeologists are seen as explorers of lost civilization 
explains mike jackson of the state historic preservation agency 
who led the tour essentially thats what were doing only were 
looking for the lost culture of the roadside lost by layers of 
later development 
jackson an architect is also a past president of the society 
for commercial archaeology which studies the artifacts symbols 
and buildings of american commerce the gas stations motels and 
coffee shops not to mention neon signs 
he was host of the 1989 midwest state historic preservation 
officers conference session that toured old route 66 in 
springfield thursday 
if you have a generation without a sense of its history you 
have these people who are culturally lost jackson said 
when the history of the 20th century is written jackson says 
it will tell how the automobile changed american life and how the 
transition from twolane roads to interstate highways changed the 
experience of travel by car 
the interstate totally isolates you from everything but the 
driving experience he said 
when you took the older highway anyplace along the route there 
could be something that you could interact with stop and get off 
the road the sense of adventure when you got to town was 
there speed wasnt the issue 
the number of small roadside motels cabin courts and gas 
stations that clustered along roads like route 66 has dwindled 
along with the traffic 
one leg of route 66 the main entryway to springfield from the 
north once had lodging places and a gas station every halfblock 
jackson said but most have been leveled or converted to another 
use 
he pointed out a 1920sera building that was built as a texaco 
station then converted into an irish tavern and is now a popular 
thai restaurant he called it typical of the process of the 
evolution of the roadside 
a few landmarks dont seem to have changed at all

foreign minister ali akbar velayati 
indicated monday there will be no dramatic change in foreign policy 
when presidentelect hashemi rafsanjani takes over including in 
irans attitude toward the united states 
velayati told a news conference iran would like to resume 
relations with all countries with which there is no hurdle in 
reestablishing ties 
but the united states is another matter he said the 
americans adopted a hostile policy towards us from the very 
beginning and they have continued this policy 
rafsanjani 54 emerged as irans new strongman after the june 3 
death of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and won an overwhelming 945 
percent of votes in fridays presidential election 
he will become the countrys most powerful leader under 
constitutional changes supported by iranians in a referendum also 
held friday 
velayati said rafsanjani has said many times before that when 
the united states abandons hostility toward us and returns our 
confiscated properties it will have shown its good will 
rafsanjani speaker of the 270member parliament or majlis has 
said us expressions of good will would lead to better ties 
and allow iran to use its influence to free us hostages believed 
held by proiranian extremists in lebanon 
irans assets in the united states were frozen and washington 
severed diplomatic ties after iranian militants stormed the us 
embassy in tehran in september 1981 and held 52 americans hostage 
for 444 days 
most of the frozen assets iran claims are in the form of 
weapons ordered from the united states and paid for but never 
delivered after the 1979 ouster of the shah mohammad reza pahlavi 
tehran claims they total 11 billion 
velayati said bilateral relations will be the main topic when 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze arrived in tehran 
later monday 
despite its official nonaligned policy of neither east nor 
west which velayati said will continue irans recent 
confrontations with the west have moved it closer to its northern 
neighbor the soviet union 
improved ties between tehran and moscow were highlighted by 
rafsanjanis trip to moscow last month where he signed agreements 
worth 6 billion including an arms deal to replenish irans 
depleted military hardware 
rafsanjani a socalled pragmatist in the iranian hierarchy is 
expected to steer the country gradually away from hostility toward 
the west laid down by khomeini when he founded the islamic republic 
under a new foreign policy forged by rafsanjani tehrans ties 
with the west gradually improved after the aug 20 ceasefire in 
irans eightyear war with iraq 
but khomeini ended rafsanjanis efforts in february with a death 
decree against indianborn british writer salman rushdie 
khomeinis religious decree said rushdie should be sought out 
and killed for blaspheming islam in his novel the satanic 
verses 
canada sweden and european community members called their 
ambassadors home in protest and tehran reacted by withdrawing its 
envoys from the 14 countries 
the ambassadors gradually have returned to their missions but 
tehran severed ties with britain over the affair and the death 
decree stands 
velayati told reporters that resuming relations with britain is 
possible only within the framework of a law passed in february that 
calls for the british government to reverse opposition to the death 
edict ban the satanic verses and destroy existing copies of 
the book there 
what the imam pronounced was a basic principle and there is 
no compromise on this velayati said iranians regarded khomeini 
as their supreme religious leader or imam 
velayati said he also will discuss with shevardnadze 
implementation of a un resolution to bring lasting peace between 
iran and iraq peace talks between the two countries are deadlocked

sea floor is of a type in which the crew quarters can be sealed 
said lt steve hardy it wasnt known if the missing workers were 
in a sealed section he said 
they usually have watertight doors which should have been 
secured if the vessel was under way hardy said 
air trapped inside would be the only oxygen for any survivors 
hardy said he said he couldnt estimate how long the air supply 
would last 
rescue efforts were hampered by 10foot seas 35 mph wind and 
heavy rain from the fringes of tropical storm chantal the coast 
guard flew divers to the rig and helicopters and a patrol boat 
were dispatched

gen czeslaw kiszczak endorsed by the 
communist party for prime minister is both head of polands police 
forces and initiator of talks with the solidarity union that he was 
responsible for suppressing 
state media announced monday the polish united workers 
communist party has backed kiszczak for prime minister to succeed 
new party first secretary mieczyslaw f rakowski 
if kiszczak is also supported by the minor partners in the 
communist coalition the peasant and democratic parties then his 
election by the parliament would seem assured but in polands 
changing political landscape nothing could be ruled out 
once a shadowy figure best known for his crackdowns on 
dissidents kiszczak emerged as a valuable negotiating partner for 
the opposition in two months of talks that resulted in solidaritys 
legalization and partially free elections 
the 63yearold army general who has been interior minister 
since 1981 donned a civilian suit for the talks and often drove 
his red peugeot to a palace in downtown warsaw where negotiations 
were held 
with a mixture of charm and toughness kiszczak quickly 
impressed union negotiators he disarmed underground writers by 
praising their essays which his investigators had presumably 
confiscated 
it was kiszczak who made the proposal for talks with the 
opposition on political and economic reform a year ago during a 
wave of nationwide strikes polands worst labor unrest in seven 
years 
walesa refused to commit solidarity to talks without a pledge 
that the union would be legalized in a dramatic reversal 
jaruzelski pushed through an offer to restore the unions legal 
status at a party plenum in january 
three weeks later as chief negotiator for the government side 
kiszczak opened the round table agreements reached april 5 led to 
legalization of solidarity and partially free elections in which 
solidarity scored dazzling victories july 4 and july 18 
but kiszczak was one of 33 out of 35 top government and party 
officials who ran unopposed on a national slate but failed to get 
the required 50 percent of votes cast 
kiszczaks relations with the opposition were not always so 
cordial 
along with jaruzelski and defense minister florian siwicki 
kiszczak helped execute the december 1981 martiallaw crackdown in 
which thousands of solidarity activists were rounded up and 
imprisoned 
three years later interior ministry security police on his 
payroll murdered the rev jerzy popieluszko a prosolidarity 
priest who had kept the ethos of the union alive in monthly masses 
for the homeland at his warsaw parish 
kiszczak saw that the four officers were convicted of murder 
but the trial stopped short of revealing any higherlevel 
involvement which some opposition members still suspect 
as head of the ministry responsible for containing the 
opposition which flourished underground after martial law kiszczak 
developed a deep knowledge of solidarity 
one leading solidarity activist who has spent years in jail for 
opposition activity recently joked that one of the best collections 
of underground literature can be found in the ministrys basement 
born in 1925 kiszczaks war experiences contributed to the 
evolution of a tough young officer 
shipped by the nazis to work as a forced laborer in the 
southwestern city of wroclaw then known by its german name of 
breslau kiszczak escaped and made his way to communist resistance 
forces in austria 
he joined the communist party in 1945 and helped in the campaign 
against polish partisans opposed to the imposition of communist 
rule 
kiszczak later attende the voroshilov academy of the soviet 
armed forces in moscow and was promoted to general in 1973 he 
served as head of military intelligence between 1972 and 1979 and 
head of the military police in the ministry of national defense 
between 1979 and 1981 
jaruzelski named kiszczak head of the interior ministry in 
august 1981

federal prosecutor led koch 4933 in the early july poll and 5127 
in the aprilmay survey

there is a surgeon on the mound a 
pediatrician and neonatologist in the outfield and a lung 
specialist with a bulletlike throw at shortstop on the bench are a 
cellular phone and a dozen beepers 
the ball players are members of the the dox a softball team 
of 13 doctors from memorial hospital in south bend 
so far this season the dox have shown more brains than brawn 
with a record of 57 
but winnings not the point 
its a pressure relief valve were coming to have a good 
time we try to avoid getting hurt we really dont expect to win 
but when we do its a bonus said dr robert white a 
neonatologist who was exhausted during a recent game because he was 
up most of the night delivering a baby 
the dox have come a long way from their first season in 1982 
when they finished 115 and were widely hailed as the worst team in 
south bends worst softball league 
the dox never practice during the season and their only 
preseason drill consists of the team captain hitting balls to a 
couple of players 
its no lie that for many guys the first ball they hit in a 
year is the first ball thats pitched to them the first game of the 
season said dr joe caruso the team captain and a 
familypractice physician 
team practice is impractical he explained because of the 
doctors busy schedules 
and thanks to the beepers and the cellular phone the dox 
occasionally have to forfeit a game when their bench loses too many 
players who must respond to emergencies

american flag in the backyard

only sami is in jail 
mrs wassef has spent much of this year in her native egypt 
seeking help for sami both say the prosecutors charge is absurd 
she said her sons reported on nonmilitary topics to a man they 
knew as tony gleaning the information mostly from a local 
englishlanguage newspaper they were told it would appear in cairo 
today an englishlanguage magazine aimed at expatriates in the 
egyptian capital she said 
not only is sami not a spy mrs wassef said but he was such 
a bad reporter that tony fired him for giving him only nonsense 
that was more than two years ago 
if the egyptians really wanted to find a spy they surely 
could do it inside the american embassy she said 
sami is an american he entered egypt on his american 
passport and nobody not the embassy not the state department 
not the white house nobody has helped him weve contacted all of 
them 
maybe if hed been a spy they might have helped him 
us embassy spokeswoman marcelle wahba only would comment that 
the american embassy has done everything it can for mrs wassef 
and her son we offer to all americans normal consular services 
mrs wassef said consul general conrad drescher first visited 
her son dec 8 three weeks after plainclothes security men 
arrested him by that time wassef had signed a 253page confession 
written in arabic which his mother says he can barely read 
his medical courses and textbooks were in english 
wassef told his mother that investigators fabricated much of his 
confession he signed it he said because he was told his luggage 
and an airline ticket to the united states were just outside the 
door if he cooperated 
he and his mother claim to have been told the case was 
prosecuted in order to facilitate the release of abdelkader helmy 
an egyptianborn american rocket scientist who has pleaded guilty 
in sacramento calif to charges he illegally procured military 
technology in the united states 
during the eight months that wassef was held without charge 
us officials never mentioned the case publicly 
however the wassefs congressman has been working on it 
privately even to approaching egyptian president hosni mubarak 
were doing everything possible to help sami wassef an aide 
to rep william s broomfield rmich said in washington were 
very concerned about health conditions in the prison 
mrs wassef said that in march four months after her sons 
arrest and four months before he was charged broomfield slipped 
mubarak a note about the case while the egyptian leader was on an 
official visit to the united states nothing happened 
although appeals remain possible mrs wassef said mubarak 
represents her sons only hope she said us ambassador frank g 
wisner whom she visited after the verdict told her to be patient 
and promised to try and get her an audience with the egyptian 
president 
the wassef family is christian reynolds told friends in egypt 
he worked with sobek travel which has offices in oakland and 
angels camp calif 
in angels camp john yost a sobek owner said reynolds worked 
two or three years ago as a consultant for a film company 
associated with the tour group 
he said he never met reynolds didnt know where he was from and 
doesnt know where he is now yost gave reynolds parents hometown 
as chevy chase md 
summing up after a 90minute trial hawari urged the three 
judges to have no mercy to make the wassefs an example to 
others 
each brother was sentenced to 10 years and a fine reynolds was 
fined and sentenced to five years 
they had sami in a cage in the courtroom all he could do was 
stand there and hold onto the wires and shout that he was 
innocent mrs wassef said 
i cant sleep when i close my eyes i see his face in the

pete rose suffered a setback today when a 
federal judge decided his lawsuit against baseball commissioner a 
bartlett giamatti belongs in federal court 
us district judge john d holschuh refused to return roses 
case to hamilton county common pleas court where rose had won an 
order tying giamattis hands in deciding whether the cincinnati 
reds manager bet on ballgames 
baseball wanted the case heard in federal court where judges 
have upheld the commissioners broad powers in previous legal 
challenges 
rose had asked that the matter be kept in common pleas court in 
the reds hometown where judge norbert a nadel has shown a 
willingness to go into what he termed uncharted waters in 
making his decisions 
its certainly a victory that puts the case in the right 
court said louis l hoynes jr baseballs chief lawyer one 
hopes that we can dispose of the case now 
rose has been accused of betting on his own team an offense 
that could get him banned from baseball for life but nadel ruled 
that giamatti had already made up his mind against rose and could 
not give him a fair disciplinary hearing 
holschuhs decision takes the case away from nadel holschuh 
also extended until at least aug 14 roses protection against 
firing or suspension over the gambling allegations 
the judge scheduled a hearing for that day on whether to extend 
the proection indefinitely 
roses lawyers were expected to appeal to the 6th us circuit 
court of appeals in cincinnati 
baseballs lawyers accused rose of trying to have the case 
decided in the court that is most subject to the influence of 
local pressures produced by his fame notoriety and close 
identification with the city of cincinnati

proiranian shiite moslems claimed today 
they executed lt col william r higgins and another group 
threatened to kill another american hostage if israel does not free 
a moslem cleric within 24 hours 
a statement signed by the organization of the oppressed on earth 
said the 44yearold higgins was hanged at 3 pm 8 am edt the 
deadline they set for israel to free sheik abulkarim obeid who 
was captured in south lebanon friday 
both the tape and statement typewritten in arabic were 
delivered to a western news agency an hour after the deadline 
higgins of danville ky was serving as head of an observer 
group attached to the un peacekeeping force in south lebanon when 
he was seized feb 17 1988 his captors accused him of spying for 
the cia 
the new threat came in a handwritten statement from the 
revolutionary justice organization saying its resolved to execute 
joseph james cicippio unless israel freed sheik abulkarim obeid by 
6 pm 11 am edt tuesday 
the statement was delivered to the independent beirut newspaper 
annahar along with an snapshot showing a smiling cicippio wearing 
a brown and pink wool sweater over a blue pullover 
cicippio 58 acting comptroller of the american university of 
beirut was kidnapped sept 12 1986 
the videotape showed a man the captors identified as higgins 
dangling from a makeshift gallows with both his hands and feet tied 
by rope taken in two 15second sequences the victim wore a white 
blindfold in one and was shown without a blindfold in another with 
his head tilted 
there was no way to immediately verify todays claims by the 
moslem group that held higgins and whether the purported hanging 
occurred today 
state department officials in washington speaking on condition 
of anonymity described as credible news reports that the victim in 
the videotape was higgins they were unable to say however 
whether the taping was done this morning or earlier 
a diplomatic source told the associated press the united nations 
received unconfirmed reports that higgins was shot to death after 
the shooting down of the iranian airbus by the uss vincennes on 
july 3 1988 at the time no specific date for the death was given 
in chicago president bush said he has no independent 
confirmation that higgins has been hanged and said he was cutting 
short his trip to return to washington to try to find out what 
happened to higgins 
i know i speak for all here when i try to express to the 
american people the sense of outrage that we all feel about this 
kind of brutality this uncalledfor terrorism he said 
a pentagon official speaking on condition of anonymity also 
said the defense department has no independent confirmation that 
higgins has been executed 
a sister of higgins said she was in a state of shock after the 
announcement today 
yes ive just spoken with the state department and i will not 
reveal what they said mary fischer said at her home in the 
louisville ky suburb of okolona right now im in a state of 
shock i just dont know 
the 30second videotape was of extremely bad quality and there 
was no indication when it was filmed 
the tape released in beirut apparently was taken in two 
sequences of 15 seconds each 
in one sequence the man purported to be higgins appeared 
dangling from a scaffold and tied to a ceiling with his head tilted 
to the left and the body swirling slowly he was wearing a white 
blindfold 
the second sequence showed him without a blindfold his eyes 
bulging he was barefoot and wearing a dark jacket and light 
trousers 
in israel officials repeated their offer to trade all the 
shiites they hold from south lebanon for three israeli servicemen 
and all foreign hostages held in lebanon 
avi pazner spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
monday israel was awaiting clear evidence that higgins was killed 
before making official statements 
but he said the exchange offer stood 
the offer was made in jerusalem earlier today by defense 
minister yitzhak rabin in an announcement broadcast on staterun 
israel radio 
shiite groups in lebanon are believed to hold three israeli 
soldiers and 17 foreigners including nine americans israeli 
security sources estimate 50 to 60 shiite moslems from lebanon are 
held in israeli prisons 
in tehran earlier today iranian foreign minister ali akbar 
velayati condemned both the death threat and the kidnapping of 
obeid 
lebanese security sources and israeli officials say obeid played 
a role in the kidnapping of higgins last year but obeid denies it 
hezbollah and the syrianbacked mainstream shiite moslem amal 
militia called a general strike in lebanon today to protest obeids 
abduction 
businesses were closed throughout moslem west beirut and its 
shiitepopulated southern slums as well as the cities of sidon 
tyre nabatieh and baalbek in south and east lebanon 
israeli deputy prime minister shimon peres defended the decision 
to abduct obeid whom israeli officials have accused of instigating 
attacks on israel he would not say what israels response to the 
death threat would be i am not willing to relate either to 
details or to threats peres said 
the group holding higgins said in a dec 12 statement that it 
had sentenced the marine to death and said he made full 
confessions about his espionage activities 
on sunday a statement by the group said we shall carry out 
by hanging the death sentence handed down against proven spy 
higgins at exactly 3 pm 8 am edt monday if sheik abdul karim 
obeid and his two brethren have not been freed by then 
israeli commandos stole into the southern lebanese village of 
jibchit early friday kidnapped obeid from his apartment and flew 
him to israel in a helicopter 
his cousin ahmed obeid and a friend majid fahs also were 
seized lebanese police said 
israel described ahmed obeid and majid fahs as assistants of 
obeid 
israeli sources say obeid was involved in the operation to 
kidnap higgins and held the marine for a time in his home 
on sunday a leading iranian official defended the threat 
against higgins 
it is very natural that the islamic clergy and militant 
groups throughout the world will take action against the interests 
of israel and the united states iranian interior minister ali 
akbar mohtashemi told a news conference in tehran they will not 
allow them to live comfortably 
he named proiranian hezbollah as one of the moslem groups that 
should retaliate 
asked about the fate of hostages in lebanon mohtashemi said 
the issue of the hostages has no direct connection with us 
an iranian newspaper said obeids abduction jeopardized moves to 
free the hostages the longestheld hostage is terry anderson 
chief middle east correspondent for the associated press he was 
abducted march 16 1985 
the zionists have introduced a new threat to humanitarian 
efforts to release hostages in lebanon the tehran times said in 
an editorial sunday 
in nicosia cyprus an anonymous caller claiming to speak for 
oppressed on earth today telephoned the office of the associated 
press and said that unless obeid is released the organization 
would kill a british hostage anglican church envoy terry waite on 
tuesday at the same hour they said they killed higgins 
the caller speaking in lebanese arabic and english said the 
body of higgins was dumped behind st joseph hospital in west 
beirut that syrians picked up higgins corpse at 4 pm and we 
are no longer responsible for the body 
it could not be immediately verified if the caller was from the 
organization which had not made previous calls to the cyprus 
office of the ap 
no body was found at the hospital and police said they could not 
confirm the killing the syrian military command whose troops 
patrol moslem areas of lebanon would not comment

vietnam has agreed to the resettlement in the 
united states of at least 19000 former prisoners who had been 
closely associated with the usbacked government in saigon state 
department officials said monday 
the agreement could mean that more than 100000 vietnamese 
prisoners and family members combined will emigrate to the united 
states the officials said the two countries expressed hope that 
the first group of 3000 will have departed vietnam before the end 
of the year 
the us officials who asked not to be identified said there 
are between 19000 and 27000 vietnamese known to have been sent to 
reeducation camps after the communist conquest of south vietnam in 
1975 all were identified with the former saigon government and 
officials said there may be others on whom the united states does 
not have records 
for each former prisoner there are four to five family members 
who would be eligible to emigrate with them to the united states 
said the officials 
a joint statement released by the state department said the 
united states promised not to encourage released detainees to 
engage in activities hostile to vietnam 
vietnam in turn pledged that no such detainees will be 
encouraged to carry out antius activities once they are 
resettled in the united states 
the two countries worked out the agreement during three days of 
talks that ended saturday 
a year ago an agreement on resettlement of the former detainees 
and their families appeared to be near but vietnam suspended talks 
after unfriendly remarks by a former top reagan administration 
official 
also monday vietnam gave a us military team what may be the 
remains of 15 american soldiers killed in the vietnam war an 
official vietnamese radio broadcast said 
a representative of vietnams office for seeking missing 
personnel gave the remains to the team from the us joint casualty 
resolution center the voice of vietnam reported 
the broadcast monitored in bangkok said it was the 25th 
repatriation since march 1974 and 391 sets of remains have been 
returned in all 
in the past remains have been returned in a us military 
ceremony at hanois noi bai airport and then flown to an army 
laboratory in hawaii for analysis 
vietnam returned what it believed to be the remains of 28 
americans on june 21 it has stepped up repatriations since an 
august 1987 agreement in which the united states pledged to help 
vietnam seek humanitarian aid 
a spokesman for the us embassy in bangkok jim williams said 
us experts were also beginning their seventh joint search to

in a new reaction to chinas crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators in june the house on monday approved a 
measure that would allow thousands of chinese students in the 
united states to forestall their return to their homeland 
the measure adopted by voice vote was sent to the senate for 
further action 
the legislation would affect 32000 of the 40000 chinese 
students in the united states those who hold exchange visitor 
visas those visas require students to return to china for at least 
two years following their time in the united states before being 
able to return or go elsewhere 
they are intended primarily for promising students whose 
educations are funded by the government in an effort to address 
the brain drain problem 
the bill sponsored by rep nancy pelosi dcalif would waive 
the requirement that they return home for two years 
passage of the measure followed the addition by the house of 
several sanctions against china to a foreign aid bill a month ago 
rep bruce morrison dconn chairman of the house judiciary 
immigration subcommittee acknowledged that the legislation carries 
with it a risk that the chinese government will curtail student 
exchanges 
but the people who govern china need to understand the 
principles of liberty and democracy in action he said all we 
are doing is saying that if the peoples republic of china wishes 
these students to come home it must do so by bringing them back by 
its own behavior it must be a voluntary return not one forced by 
the laws of the united states

president bush said today he has no final 
confirmation that marine lt col william higgins was hanged by his 
middle eastern captors but he cut short a twoday western trip to 
deal with a matter that has shocked the american people right to 
the core 
bush said in chicago that he would first try to learn what had 
happened to higgins and then figure out what might conceivably 
be done in response 
he ordered a lateafternoon meeting of his national security 
advisers 
meanwhile death threats were made against another american 
hostage and a british hostage 
arriving at the white house bush told reporters i dont have 
what i would call a final confirmation that higgins had been 
killed he said he had talked to the un secretary general and to 
higgins wife robin whom he described as a stoic individual who 
is going through sheer hell 
at this juncture we want to get all the information and be 
sure were dealing with facts but it is a most troubling and 
disturbing matter that has shocked the american people right to the 
core the president said 
there is no way i can properly express the outrage that i 
feel he said and somehow there has got to be a return to 
decency and honor even in matters of this nature 
higgins 44 was serving as part of an international 
peacekeeping force in lebanon when he was taken captive in february 
1988 proiranian shiite moslem captors said today they hanged him 
in retaliation for israels kidnapping of a moslem cleric the 
group released a videotape purporting to show the execution 
a group called the revolutionary justice organization said in a 
statement delivered to the independent beirut newspaper annahar 
that it would execute another american hostage joseph james 
cicippio unless israel freed obeid by 6 pm 11 am edt tuesday 
cicippio 58 acting comptroller of the american university of 
beirut was kidnapped sept 12 1986 
in nicosia cyprus an anonymous caller claiming to speak for 
oppressed on earth said in a phone call to the associated press 
that unless obeid is released the organization would kill a 
british hostage anglican church envoy terry waite the caller said 
waite would be killed tuesday at the same hour higgins was killed 
secretary of state james a baker iii returning home from a 
conference in paris called the reported killing outrageous and 
uncivilized behavior but he added i do have to say that these 
reports are as yet unconfirmed and i am not in a position to 
confirm the accuracy of the report 
state department officials insisting on anonymity described as 
credible news reports that the victim in the videotape was indeed 
higgins they were unable to say however whether the taping was 
done this morning or earlier 
a senior administration official speaking to reporters aboard 
the plane carrying baker back to washington said the united states 
is not holding israel responsible for the reported execution of 
higgins 
the official who demanded that reporters not identify him 
said violence and kidnaping are not the route to peace in the 
middle east 
asked if the statements bush and baker had made deploring 
kidnaping were intended as criticism of israel the official said 
i am not criticizing israel for what it did thats not the 
interpretation 
israel offered earlier in the day to swap the cleric sheik 
abdul karim obeid and that countrys shiite moslem captives in 
exchange for all captured israeli soldiers and foreign hostages 
held by shiite groups in lebanon 
bush had no comment on the israeli proposal although he said 
last week i dont think kidnapping and violence helps the cause 
of peace 
but senate republican leader bob dole said in washington 
perhaps a little more responsibility on the part of the israelis 
one of these days would be refreshing 
a somber president made his comments in the opening moments of a 
speech to the national governors association meeting in chicago 
the first stop of what had been planned as a threestate trip 
whether this report is true or not i know i speak for all 
here when i try to express to the american people the sense of 
outrage that we all feel about this kind of brutality this 
uncalledfor terrorism bush said 
this was a young american colonel serving in international 
force and it is incumbent upon all of us to try and rectify this 
situation if at all possible he said 
bush offered no details of his plans as he stopped briefly to 
answer reporters questions 
this is a matter of grave concern to the american people he 
said discussing is not the way to conduct the foreign policy or 
national security policy of this country were not going to handle 
it that way 
bush canceled visits to las vegas and oklahoma city today and 
tuesday to return to washington he said he would convene our top 
national security people and confirm to the best of our ability if 
this report is true and then consider what might be done 
there are nine americans in captivity in the middle east 
including terry anderson middle east correspondent for the 
associated press 
pete williams a spokesman for defense secretary dick cheney 
said cheney is following the same reports we are all following 
cheney met with higgins wife robin on saturday and both 
appeared during the day at the annual convention of a group formed 
to support the families of prisoners of war and those missing in 
action in southeast asia 
in his brief comments bush made no comment about the proposed 
swap advanced by israels defense minister yitzhak rabin 
before bush made his comments dole said that if the reports of 
higgins killing were true he hoped the administration woulid have 
an appropriate response im not certain when an appropriate 
response would be but im certain there should be a response he 
said 
dole also said that if the reports of higgins death were true 
the i would hope the israelis would take another look at some of 
their actions that they must know in advance would endanger 
american lives 
dole said he hoped bush could have some understanding with the 
israelis about future conduct which ive indicated endangers the 
lives of americans

the nations governors on monday welcomed 
president bushs call to meet with him this fall on education even 
as they pressed concerns about spending on transportation and 
medicaid 
bush formally announced plans for a summit on education with the 
governors in late september during an appearance before the annual 
meeting of the national governors association the meeting on 
education was one of several the governors had asked for in a 
private meeting with the president in may 
were impressed with the accessiblity and indications of a 
cooperative attitude from bush said virginia gov gerald 
baliles a democrat and chairman of the governors association 
democrat bill clinton of arkansas said the summit will keep 
education and childrelated issues on the public agenda 
but ohio gov richard celeste a democrat who has indicated 
presidential ambitions said bushs remarks were too little 
considering bushs campaign claim to be the education president 
i thought it was a rather uninspired and uninspiring 
presentation of the presidents priorities with which no one is 
going to disagree celeste said in an interview it lacked any 
real vision or any real voltage in terms of getting us moving now 
celeste said one issue in the education meeting would be what he 
said was a dampening effect on state and local education 
initiatives created by the budget climate and bushs flat 
opposition to new taxes 
the presidents posture last year in the election really 
chilled efforts at education reform and education finance in many 
parts of this country celeste said the president is in a 
unique position to sound the trumpet and i didnt hear any brass 
this morning 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis the democratic presidential 
nominee who lost to bush last year shook hands with bush and spoke 
briefly but to reporters dukakis complained about washingtons 
inability to deal with this deficit and pointed to his own tax 
increases and budget cuts in massachusetts 
i had to cut and cut deeply dukakis said 
governors will tell you well do everything we can to try to 
help congress and the administraion deal with it but weve been 
doing that since 1983 dukakis said 
governors of both parties met in private over breakfast before 
bushs address and several governors said later that the major 
concern voiced in the meeting was federal medicaid requirements 
that force states to spend more on health care without 
compensation from the federal government those socalled mandates 
include requirements for additional types of coverage 
in a questionandanswer session with bush celeste asked the 
president to consider a twoyear moratorium on additional medicaid 
mandates which he later described as the fastest growing spending 
item in his state budget 
bush did not commit himself to such a moratorium but said id 
like to consider it and certainly were trying to hold the line on 
spiraling costs 
bush and transportation secretary samuel skinner who later 
addressed the governors both suggested they were sympathetic with 
the governors on the issue of surplus federal transportation trust 
funds another major concern the governors voiced during the 
meeting 
the trust funds for highways and airport facilities contain as 
much as 19 billion according to governors who contend much of 
that is not obligated to specific projects and is being withheld 
from the states so it can count against the deficit in the federal 
budget 
i know the frustration around this table bush said when 
you see this tremendous highway trust fund and wonder why those 
funds arent immediately available for the purposes for which they 
are earmarked the answer obviously is budgetary 
baliles said he pressed the point with skinner in private 
skinner drew applause later when he voiced sympathy and suggested 
that congress was to blame without promising any money 
baliles said later that the issue was being discussed at 
different levels but celeste complained it seems to me we 
have a long way to go to get to the point where we have the money 
we need

the united states reestablished 
highlevel contact with china monday nearly two months after troops 
forcibly put down a prodemocracy demonstration in tiananmen square 
and found considerable agreement on cambodias future 
but secretary of state james a baker iii who requested the 
meeting with chinese foreign minister qian qichen in paris 
stressed that americans were unhappy with chinas actions which 
threatened the country with diplomatic isolation if continued a 
senior us official said 
the onehour and 35minute meeting was held in a side room of a 
conference hall in which 19 nations including the united states 
and china are seeking to end civil war in cambodia and guide the 
southeast asian nation toward rehabilitation after decades of wars 
and a vietnamese invasion 
the official who insisted on anonymity told reporters as baker 
flew home from paris that baker and qian had agreed that the khmer 
rouge accused of murdering more than 1 million cambodians in a 
fouryear reign of terror in the 1970s should not have a dominant 
role in any cambodian government 
but the official said the chinese who backed the khmer rouge 
sought more of a role than the united states would like the group 
to have as prince norodom sihanouk attempts to form a transitional 
government 
after chinese troops fired on demonstrators june 34 president 
bush imposed a series of sanctions which were criticized by many in 
congress as too mild they included a ban on highlevel exchanges 
between us and chinese officials and visits to beijing by senior 
us government officials 
baker taking the view that the sanctions did not keep him from 
meeting with qian outside china requested the meeting in which the 
major topic was cambodias future 
on that subject the official said they found considerable 
agreement especially that vietnam should release its hold on the 
country a government installed by hanoi is in power in pnom penh 
but vietnamese troops are scheduled to depart by the end of 
september 
asked if qian had been swayed by bakers argument against a 
powerful role for the khmer rouge the official said we simply 
had a frank and candid exchange on the issue he called it the 
one significant difference between washington and beijing 
on chinas own internal policies the official said baker 
made the point that repression would not be understood by the 
american people 
the official said that if china intends to continue on the path 
of reform it should not isolate itself with conduct that would 
not be understood 
baker stressed that the united states wants to maintain strong 
ties with china but bush cant do it alone hes going to need 
some help in terms of the future course of actions in beijing

in nicosia cyprus an anonymous caller claiming to speak for 
oppressed on earth telephoned the office of the associated press 
and said the organization would kill a british hostage anglican 
church envoy terry waite at the same time tuesday unless obeid was 
released 
the caller speaking in lebanese arabic and english said the 
body of higgins was dumped behind st joseph hospital in west 
beirut that syrians picked up higgins corpse at 4 pm and we 
are no longer responsible for the body 
it could not be immediately verified if the caller was from the 
organization which had not made previous calls to the cyprus 
office of the ap 
no body was found at the hospital and police said they could not 
confirm the killing the syrian military command whose troops 
patrol moslem areas of lebanon would not comment 
a police spokesman said it seems highly unlikely that the 
captors were able to hang the man take the film and distribute it 
inside an hour 
in israel officials repeated their offer to trade all shiites 
they hold from south lebanon for three israeli soldiers and the 
western hostages 
at un headquarters in new york perez de cuellars spokesman 
juancarlos brandt said if higgins had been killed the 
secretarygeneral can only express his outrage and revulsion at the 
fact that an innocent man serving the united nations in the cause 
of peace should be murdered in this fashion 
in iran foreign minister ali akbar velayati had said earlier 
the threat to higgins has nothing to do with us but added that 
israel should be pressed to release obeid we condemn any kind of 
kidnapping or death threat he said 
higgins of danville ky led a 75man observer team attached 
to the un peacekeeping force in south lebanon when he was 
abducted near tyre 
previous statements from his captors claimed he used the un 
post as a cover for spying on moslem guerrillas 
in their last statement on dec 12 1988 they said higgins had 
been sentenced to death after making full confessions about his 
espionage activities 
sources in the un force have said they believe higgins was 
dead when that statement was issued they said they had information 
he died of maltreatment after an attempt to escape 
previous statements from the captors were accompanied by 
photographs of the decorated vietnam veteran or of his military 
identification card 
a diplomatic source told the associated press the united nations 
got unconfirmed reports that higgins was killed after the uss 
vincennes on duty in the persian gulf shot down an iranian 
jetliner on july 3 1988 
the death of another hostage 67yearold journalist alec 
collett was announced under similar circumstances in april 1986 
collett was kidnapped march 25 1985 while on assignment in 
lebanon for a un agency 
his captors said he was hanged in retaliation for the april 15 
1986 us air raids on libya a videotape of a body suspended from 
a gallows could not be verified and no body was found 
waite 50 disappeared jan 20 1987 while seeking the release 
of foreign hostages after leaving his west beirut hotel to 
negotiate with islamic jihad he is believed held by islamic jihad 
though no group has claimed responsibility for his abduction or 
made demands for his release

new yorkers with aids and related illnesses will 
need 7 billion in health and social services over the next 4 
years a task force said monday 
the new york city aids task force predicted that by the end of 
1993 4990 acutecare hospital beds onefifth of the citys 
total will hold aids patients 
the money is needed to double the number of hospital beds 
nursing home beds and housing units for aids patients as well as 
to provide outpatient longterm and home health care said dr 
stephen c joseph task force chairman and city health commissioner 
the report also calls for greatly expanded prevention programs 
including aids education in all grades it calls for elimination of 
waiting lists for treatment of drug abusers many of whom are 
exposed to aids by sharing needles it urges that people with aids 
and related illnesses should be treated by communitybased 
organizations whenever possible and says those organizations 
should get more money from the private and public sectors 
the 29member task force includes government and private medical 
experts and representatives of business and aids support groups 
its recommendations arent binding but the report will be used as 
a lobbying tool and a blueprint for public and nonprofit agencies 
joseph said 
as of june 30 there were 20177 aids cases reported in new york 
city according to the federal centers for disease control in 
atlanta 20 percent of the national total of 99936 cases 
by the end of 1993 the report said the cumulative total in the 
city may reach 63952 aids cases and perhaps 50157 deaths 
the report says it appears that people with aids are surviving 
longer partly due to earlier diagnosis and better treatment 
studies are urgently needed to predict their needs it says 
special services should be developed for teenagers a group 
where the disease is likely to increase silently but quickly in 
the years to come the report warns 
leaders of minority groups were urged to heighten awareness of 
the disease in their communities the mentally retarded and 
mentally ill also must be taught how to avoid the virus the report

low creeping jungle fires fed by debris 
from hurricane gilbert have charred hundreds of miles of the 
yucatan peninsula but the beaches have been spared 
we need two or three days of continual rain to put it out we 
need another hurricane but a benevolent one said jose angel 
loria the agriculture departments top official in quintana roo 
state 
prevailing winds from the sea pushed the fires and smoke away 
from the plush resort of cancun where they started in march on the 
citys western fringes and from a string of towns dotting the 
whitesand coast 
but by the end of july the fires had burned 370000 acres of 
forest in a 70mile strip down the yucatan feeding on deadfall 
from last septembers hurricane ecologists say the fire has 
damaged the thin soil and accuse the government of bumbling and 
delay in fighting the blaze 
the cancun fires are an ecological disaster of great 
proportions said homero aridjis a spokesman for the group of 
100 artists and intellectuals one of mexicos main environmental 
organizations 
mark goldston of syosset ny saw thin columns of smoke as he 
flew into cancun for a vacation 
there were so many of them we began to wonder if they were 
geysers of some sort he said 
traveling along the coast to the south he noticed the smell of 
smoke on that road and west toward the mayan ruins of chichen 
itza patches of burned jungle run up to the edge of the road 
but a tourist on the beach at cancuns hotel strip across a 
large lagoon from the mainland wouldnt know there was a fire 
several tourists mentioned seeing smoke from the air but none said 
it interfered with their vacation 
jose ignacio pedroza alvarez administrator of the cancun office 
of the urban development and ecology department said loss of 
vegetation and dislocation of wildlife is substantial 
slowmoving creatures like snakes have been found in the ashes 
but most large mammals and other swiftmoving animals are believed 
to have escaped he said no one has been injured or killed and no 
homes have been destroyed 
they have gone to nearby areas fortunately jungle areas that 
have the same characteristics he said they may adapt to the 
place but two things can happen the struggle against other 
species for food and the competition for space 
gilberts howling winds left 25 million acres of forest a 
tinderbox of fallen trees branches and leaves there have been 
similar fires after previous hurricanes but they didnt blow down 
as much timber 
the yucatan forest on a limestone cap covered by as little as 
three inches of soil is not the classic towering rain forest of 
broadleafed trees tangles of vines and dangling lianas like the 
famous lacondon jungle 400 miles to the southwest most of the 
yucatan trees are under 100 feet tall 
loria said the six main fires stretch from the northeast corner 
of the yucatan peninsula 70 miles south past cancun toward the 
snorkeling lagoon of xel ha 
what we are sure of is that man caused the fires said 
loria he said they could have been ignited by the slash and burn 
agriculture common in the area cigarette butts or campfires left 
by hunters 
critics say bureaucracy interfered with projects to clear fallen 
timber and that the government did nothing when the fires started 
confident the rains would come as usual in may but there has 
been little rain 
there was little attention from the state government until the 
situation reached uncontrollable proportions said fernando 
gutierrez who is active in the local mayab ecological group 
loria said some work was done but confirmed that officials were 
in fact waiting for rain in july he said winds fanned the 
flames spreading the fire 2500 acres a day 
that was when 2700 army and navy troops were called in joining 
a maximum of 500 civilians to cut firebreaks and limit the blazes 
the fire has been fickle sending out fingers a foot or two high 
that turn the litter of leaves to thick ash burn small trees and 
char big trunks until a tree topples but sparing others 
from a lowflying plane blackened earth shows through a 
stillgreen canopy some trees that survived may die soon because 
their roots burned pedroza said

a congressional commission will soon condemn the 
secretly signed nazisoviet pact that gave the three baltic 
republics to the soviet union a legislator said monday 
the kremlin has denied existence of the secret section of the 
molotovribbentrop pact for 50 years although it long has been 
accepted in the west 
the 26member panel of the soviet congress of peoples deputies 
is expected to vote this week on a report acknowledging existence 
of the agreement said one of its members estonian legislator igor 
n gryazin 
he said in an interview the commission will publish the 
agreement and declare it null and void 
the agreement is at the heart of a drive by people in latvia 
lithuania and estonia for more control over their own affairs if 
not outright independence 
soviet history books long have claimed that latvia lithuania 
and estonia voluntarily joined the union of soviet socialist 
republics at the beginning of world war ii baltic activists say 
the secret protocol is evidence they were forced to do so 
gryazin said the final report does not take an even more radical 
step demanded by many baltic activists that of saying that the 
protocol paved the way for the 1940 soviet takeover gryazin said 
instead it says stalinist methods of foreign policy became 
possible due to this protocol according to the legislator 
still gryazin said weve done a good job if you think that 
from a period of total denial to acceptance has been just three 
weeks of commission meetings 
president mikhail s gorbachev supported the creation of the 
parliamentary commission in june but implied western copies of the 
secret protocol might be forgeries however the kremlin clearly 
supports the findings because the commission is chaired by 
gorbachev ally and ruling politburo member alexander n yakovlev 
and includes valentin m falin head of the international 
department of the communist party central committee 
hundreds of baltic dissidents have been jailed over the years 
for protesting the pact named for the men who signed it the soviet 
foreign minister vyacheslav molotov and his german counterpart 
joachim von ribbentrop 
but under gorbachevs more tolerant approach toward dissent 
thousands of baltic residents have demonstrated regularly against 
the pact which new more liberal estonian and lithuanian 
governments in may asked the kremlin to renounce unofficial 
political groups in latvia have made similar calls 
major demonstrations are scheduled in the three republics on 
aug 23 the 50th anniversary of the pact 
newspapers in all three republics published the pact a year ago 
and it appeared in june in a smallcirculation monthly questions 
of history 
gryazin said the commission on the political and legal 
evaluation of the 1939 sovietgerman nonaggression pact expects to 
publish its report this week with an authenticated version of the 
pact in the masscirculation national press for the first time 
before the full congress votes on it 
the draft report calls on the 2250member congress scheduled 
to meet in october to declare the pact legally null and void 
and an aberration from leninist principles which 
contradicted the sovereignty and independence of a number of third 
states the third states are latvia lithuania and estonia which 
were independent between the two world wars and poland 
baltic parliaments decided to join the soviet union in 1940 but 
activists and many historians say this was done under pressure the 
united states and several other western nations describe the 
baltics as enslaved nations and never have recognized their 
incorporation into the soviet union 
gryazin said it is important to realize that if we want to be 
in the soviet union we want to have some guarantee that the soviet 
union denies such forceful methods and accepts democratic forms 
of federation 
he predicted baltic residents will see the report as approval 
of an elementary fact and other skeptical soviets will become 
convinced though it will be a shock for them 
gryazin a law professor said the parliamentary commission 
obtained 55 pounds of documents and a copy of the protocol from the 
us library of congress

mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors were increasing rocket attacks 
on kabul to have something in their hand when the ussoviet 
talks started in stockholm 
united nations sources said that from june 25 to july 30 
rockets killed 257 people and injured 687 in kabul 
amani said an average of 15 rockets were being fired daily into 
the capital most by remote control or timers from mountains 
villages and wooded areas where they are difficult to detect he 
said some rockets had been found in search operations in northern 
kabul 
the summer school vacation which lasts about two weeks and was 
scheduled to end july 29 has been extended for two weeks because 
of the rocketing amani said 
he said that in recent weeks rockets hit seven schools and if 
classes had been in session the number of victims would have been 
much higher 
elsewhere amani said government troops ambushed an enemy 
ammunition convoy southeast of jalalabad killing 75 guerrillas and 
wounding 112 large quantities of arms and ammunition were seized 
and destroyed he said 
the report could not be independently confirmed both sides in 
the war have been known to inflate casualty figures 
jalalabad 75 miles east of kabul and 45 miles west of the 
pakistani border has been the scene of fierce fighting since the 
withdrawal of the last of 110000 soviet troops on feb 15 the 
guerrillas have been repulsed twice in their attempts to take the

the first doctor to be penalized for 
violating a 1986 federal law prohibiting patient dumping said 
monday he fears the ruling may limit patients access to improved 
technology 
michael burditt of victoria said he will appeal the 20000 
civil penalty imposed on him by the us department of health and 
human services 
administrative law judge charles e stratton ruled that burditt 
let his fear of a malpractice lawsuit cloud his judgment when he 
ordered a poor sick woman who was about to give birth transferred 
to another hospital 160 miles away 
i feel this ruling is very dangerous not only to every 
physician but to every patient also burditt said 
were going to be fearful of transferring patients in the 
future burditt said at a news conference it will severely 
limit any patients access to needed technology or physicians who 
are accustomed to using that technology 
i would be scared to death if i was practicing in a rural 
setting he said i would be concerned id get over my head and 
lose a patient for lack of being able to transfer the patient to 
needed technology or a bettertrained physician 
burditt was chief of the obstetrical department at the private 
detar hospital when rosa rivera showed up at the emergency room on 
dec 5 1986 with a dangerously high blood pressure of 210 over 
160 
burditt told nurses by phone the patient sounds like more than 
i can handle and he did not want to take care of this lady 
burditt drove to the hospital examined her and ordered her 
transferred to a betterequipped hospital in galveston despite the 
objections of nurses who feared it would violate the thennew law 
against patient dumping the law specifies that hospitals must 
treat patients in medical emergencies or in active labor 
burditt said he would choose his patients until detar paid his 
malpractice premiums but he also stayed to deliver a baby of 
another poor uninsured women who was seven months pregnant and 
bleeding 
mrs rivera bore a healthy 6pound baby boy in the ambulance 
parked on the roadside 40 miles east of victoria she and the baby 
were returned to detar where another doctor treated them 
detar which nearly lost its eligibility for medicare funding 
paid a 5000 fine after an investigation by the dallas regional 
office of the department of health and human services 
burditts attorney edward ganem said they will try an 
administrative appeal but also will seek help in a federal court 
if necessary he said strattons opinion gave scant consideration 
to testimony by burditt and other witnesses at a fiveday hearing

wall slogans have appeared in the occupied west 
bank threatening a palestinian lawyer who held talks with prime 
minister yitzhak shamir of israel 
the lawyer said he also has been threatened by someone he 
believes to be an israeli extremist 
in the israelioccupied lands two palestinian youths were shot 
to death monday in stonethrowing clashes with israeli troops in 
jerusalem a palestinian laborer stabbed and wounded his foreman a 
jewish settler 
the palestinian attorney jamil tarifi of the west bank town of 
ramallah said last week he recently met with shamir the prime 
minister has held a series of meetings with palestinians from the 
occupied territories but tarifi is the only one who has 
acknowledged attending the sessions 
israel is trying to find palestinians with no links to the 
palestine liberation organization who will cooperate with its plan 
to hold elections on limited autonomy for the occupied territories 
late last year bethlehem mayor elias freij was threatened by 
plo officials including group leader yasser arafat forcing him to 
back off from his call for a oneyear suspension of the palestinian 
uprising in the occupied lands 
slogans painted in black on walls in the west bank town of 
ramallah condemned the meeting between shamir and tarifi 
a meeting with shamir is a bullet shot in the back of the 
intefadeh or palestinian uprising one said shame on jamil 
tarifi and all those who meet the murderers of our people 
another read 
tarifi 42 said one wall message was signed by the popular 
front for the liberation of palestine a marxist faction of the plo 
led by george habash 
the group wants to escalate the 19month palestinian rebellion 
in the occupied lands and rejects what it views as compromise 
offers to israel from plo chairman yasser arafat who leads the 
plos mainstream fatah wing 
there are political differences between the mainstream in the 
plo and the pflp tarifi said but he said he was not sure the 
threats actually came from the marxist faction 
it is sufficient for me that yasser arafat and fatahs no 2 
man salah khalaf and the great majority of palestinians backed my 
meeting with shamir he said 
shamir said monday that any threat is regrettable he added 
that palestinian extremists were trying to prevent palestinians 
from speaking openly 
tarifi said he also was threatened by an anonymous phone caller

the scene was bleak at food store no 68 
at 1230 pm monday 
there was no bread little milk no flour no cheese the meager 
daily deliveries had been sold out 
maybe theres a war coming said one shopper after walking 
in looking at the bare shelves and walking out 
i havent had any breakfast because i couldnt get any 
bread complained an office worker 
we will have some bread later the shop attendant in the 
stateowned store said he had no answer when he was asked when 
and ill end up eating my breakfast together with supper 
said a woman who left 
there were a few things left to buy in the store ketchup and 
bottled beets fruit preserves yogurt four jars of a sour milk 
beverage called kefir hard candy cocoa and a few packages of 
pretzel sticks 
one woman said it was fortunate her family was on vacation in 
the countryside where supplies were a little more abundant all 
she had found to put in her shopping basket monday was kefir and a 
head of cauliflower 
ill be on a diet she said 
food shortages have become more widespread in poland in recent 
months monday many more shoppers than usual came out to buy goods 
before price controls are lifted tuesday and prices soar under a 
controversial government program 
meat rationing is also being abolished meaning families will no 
longer have the right to buy 55 pounds of meat per person monthly 
at relatively low governmentsubsidized prices consumers have had 
to stand several hours in line waiting for meat deliveries 
the government has blamed the shortages on decisions by polands 
mainly private farmers to cut meat and grain deliveries to the 
state this summer the farmers have said the deliveries are 
unprofitable because the prices the government pays are too low 
as meat became scarce consumers bought more dairy products 
fish and flour which they use to make dumplings for meatless 
meals sugar also is in short supply because it is used in 
preserving the seasons fruit for later in the year 
under the new program intended to improve supplies farmers are 
to be freed to sell their produce to whoever they want at whatever 
prices they can get 
government food subsidies will remain stable however 
stateowned stores and food processors are supposed to pass their 
added purchasing costs to consumers 
politburo member wladyslaw baka who opposed introducing the 
program at this time estimated it could raise prices 300 to 400 
percent 
i dont care what the prices are anymore said a teacher who 
refused to stand in a threehour line for bread at another warsaw 
shop let them raise them i simply want to be able to buy what i 
need 
but other consumers were worried about price increases 
if i make from 24000 to 30000 zloties a month or about 29 
to 36 i cant even dream of buying better meat or a piece of 
ham said one elderly woman interviewed on state television 
the average monthly wage in poland is about 127 dollars on the 
private market meat can cost up to 430 a pound

a congressman said monday he is changing plans 
in a bid to gain more support for house action on his proposal to 
delay implementation of major parts of the medicare catastrophic 
health program 
the delay bill introduced by rep harris w fawell rill is 
among various measures in congress to revise or repeal the medicare 
expansion which is being phased in over the three years that 
started jan 1 
however fawell is the only legislator who has filed a formal 
petition to force his bill directly onto the house floor rather 
than going through the ways and means committee which deals with 
such legislation 
his parliamentary maneuver requires 218 signatures to succeed 
enough to pass a bill on the house floor 
in what he said was largely an appeal to fellow members fawell 
held a news conference to announce that he was revising the 
proposed rule of action under which his legislation would be taken 
up to specifically allow for four amendments to be debated on the 
house floor 
fawell said he hoped that would encourage house members to sign 
his petition to gain full debate of the issue even if they dont 
necessarily support his call for a oneyear delay

robin higgins wife of marine lt col william 
r higgins said monday reports from lebanon that her husband had 
been executed were not pleasant but she did not know whether 
they are true 
president bush told mrs higgins that reports concerning 
richs death are not confirmed she said in a statement released 
by her attorney gregory craig 
one thing i have learned over the past 17 months is that the 
truth is hard to find and it remains so said mrs higgins 37 
who is a major in the marine corps and works at the pentagon as a 
public information officer 
mrs higgins did not come to work monday but arrived at the 
building at midmorning with higgins 19yearold daughter chrissy 
they remained secluded out of reporters sight 
in her office mrs higgins coworkers anxiously watched 
television monitors for the latest news from lebanon 
in chicago bush canceled plans to travel to nevada and 
oklahoma and returned to washington to deal with the situation 
i have been contacted by president bush who has offered his 
personal support during this time of trial for the higgins 
family mrs higgins said adding that defense secretary dick 
cheney had also pledged his support 
bush described mrs higgins as a stoic individual who is going 
through sheer hell 
needless to say the news from beirut is not pleasant mrs 
higgins said i must however await confirmation i have seen 
the reports and have not reached any conclusion myself she urged 
americans not to draw any premature conclusions during this 
terrible time of uncertainty 
television networks broadcast a videotape monday showing 
pictures of a dead body purporting to be that of higgins 44 
higgins is one of nine americans held hostage by proiranian shiite 
moslems in lebanon 
peggy say the sister of another lebanon hostage associated 
press correspondent terry anderson urged american officials to 
respond cautiously to higgins reported death 
what we have witnessed in the israeli retaliation in kind for 
the kidnapping of their people is that violence truly does beget 
violence and that i hope the united states will use this 
opportunity for reconciliation rather than retaliation mrs say 
said in an interview from her home near cadiz ky 
an eye for an eye only leaves both sides blind 
in her statement mrs higgins appealed to those holding higgins 
to put an end to this needless cycle of violence and 
victimization by releasing my husband right now and sending him 
home 
craig said mrs higgins wanted to be left alone by reporters and 
he urged outsiders to show respect for the higgins privacy 
cheneys spokesman pete williams said mrs higgins met with 
the defense secretary on saturday at the pentagon before both spoke 
to a group of families whose relatives who are prisoners of war or 
are missing in southeast asia 
higgins sister mary fisher said from her home in the 
louisville ky suburb of okolona that she believed higgins 
probably was dead even before she saw the videotape how can i 
doubt it she said 
mrs fisher said she had spoken with officials with the state 
department but would not reveal what she was told 
higgins aunt leona huffman awaited some official confirmation 
at her home in lancaster ky 
im just not going to believe anything until i hear direct

an appeals court on monday unanimously upheld 
the convictions and sentences of three young men who took part in 
the 1986 howard beach attack in which a black man fleeing a white 
gang was hit by a car and killed 
in doing so the court affirmed the trial judges ruling that 
defense attorneys like prosecutors may not use peremptory 
challenges to exclude jurors on the basis of race 
a message loud and clear must go forth that racial violence by 
any person or group whatever their race will not be tolerated by 
a just and civilized society and that when it does occur it must 
be appropriately punished wrote the five justices from the state 
appellate division in brooklyn 
in the first decision the three defendants had argued that the 
evidence introduced at their trial did not justify their 
convictions and that certain confessions were tainted and should 
have been suppressed 
but the justices disagreed 
defense attorneys also had objected to a ruling by the trial 
judge justice thomas demakos that limited them in barring blacks 
from the jury 
demakos cited a us supreme court ruling that prosecutors could 
not use peremptory challanges to exclude jurors on the basis of 
race the high court ruling did not specifically say whether 
defense attorneys could do the same 
the appeals court said the ruling did not affect the outcome of 
the trial since the only black juror seated as a result of the 
ruling was excused before deliberations 
scott kern 20 jon lester 20 and jason ladone 18 were 
convicted in december 1987 of seconddegree manslaughter and 
firstdegree assault for attacking three black men in the howard 
beach section of queens on dec 20 1986 one of the black men 
23yearold michael griffith was struck by a car and killed as he 
fled 
another man cedric sandiford was beaten with a baseball bat 
and tree limbs 
lester was sentenced to 15 to 30 years in prison kern received 
a six to 18year term and ladone was sentenced to five to 15 
years kern and ladone had their sentences stayed pending the 
appeal lester who was sentenced to one to three years in prison 
on an unrelated prior conviction for weapons possession is in jail 
this is a precedent said charles l weintraub a lawyer for 
the three defendants the supreme court has never said that this 
applies to defense lawyers 
he said he would ask the court of appeals the states highest 
court to hear the case 
in a separate decision the justices also upheld the sixmonth 
sentence given to a fourth defendant who testified for the 
prosecution 
robert riley was sentenced to six months after pleading guilty 
to firstdegree assault he had asked that the sentence be reduced 
but the justices ruled it was neither harsh nor excessive 
his attorney richard e mischel said riley would surrender 
when notified by the court

president bush declaring that together we can 
raise the level of learning in the classrooms of america on 
monday summoned the nations governors to a september summit on 
education 
the sept 2728 meeting at a still unselected site will be only 
the third time in us history that a president has convened the 
governors to help meet a pressing national problem 
bush in a speech overshadowed by the reported hanging of marine 
lt col william higgins by shiite moslem kidnappers in lebanon 
also enlisted the governors aid to combat drugs and crime and 
encouraged them to pursue trade with poland and hungary 
afterward bush returned immediately to the white house he 
canceled the rest of a twoday western trip to address conventions 
of disabled american veterans in las vegas nev and the fraternal 
order of police in oklahoma city 
bush told the 50 state chief executives to cure our nation of 
illiteracy drug abuse and crime we must act in tandem president 
with governor and governor with mayor up and down the line in 
short we must find our collective will as a nation 
today we do not meet in a spirit of immediate crisis the 
nation is sound declared bush but the decline of our 
educational system the threat of crime and drugs the economic 
dependency of so many these problems threaten to endanger the 
very leadership position of america in the next century 
a nation in which a half of our youth is ignorant of 
geography in which drugs are rampant in which a substantial 
proportion of the population knows little hope such a nation will 
not long remain competitive he said 
these problems he said are issues of our national 
wellbeing even our national security 
only twice before have the governors met with the president on 
an issue of vital national importance now there will be a third 
such conference an historic meeting on education said bush 
the first time was when teddy roosevelt brought the governors to 
the white house to call for conservation for an end to the 
reckless denuding of our forests bush said the second was when 
franklin d roosevelt sought the governors help on how to meeting 
on how to stem the financial crisis of the great depression 
working together we can find ways to strengthen our schools 
to enlarge opportunities and to improve our nations educational 
performance said the president together we can raise the 
level of learning in the classrooms of america he said 
bush claimed a 400 millionplus package of education reforms he 
sent congress in april would help redeem the future of millions 
of children 
that package includes new support for magnet schools and 
programs in which parents can choose the public school their child 
attends 
the essence of reform is accountability in education and 
reward for those schools that show progress bush said 
bush campaigned on a promise to convene an education summit of 
the governors 
while no surprise his announcement got a receptive response 
from the state chiefs 
iowa gov terry branstad a republican who is the incoming 
chairman of the national governors association said the governors 
welcomed the chance to work with bush on developing consensus 
goals to improve the quality of education 
we want to involve all the people in this nation that are 
concerned about rebuilding and strengthening the schools 
branstad said 
two democratic governors in different ways asked bush whether 
he stood ready to provide more funds for education 
arkansas gov bill clinton asked what the federal role was in 
helping send more needy students to college so that they can be 
internationally competitive 
clearly the federal government has a role replied bush 
but every time we get to worthy goals i have to say wait 
how do we meet grammrudman targets in all of that bush said 
louisiana gov buddy roemer after a long preamble about the 
need to improve literacy in the south and educate a better 
workforce concluded what im trying to say mr president is 
send money 
bush laughd and replied that he hoped the education summit would 
afford an opportunity to take a considerable amount of time to 
discuss these kinds of issues

philipp brothers inc a new yorkbased 
commodity futures trading concern and three affiliates have agreed 
to pay a record 4 million in penalties to settle allegations of 
fraud in cocoa futures contracts federal regulators said monday 
philipp brothers is a whollyowned subsidiary of the wall street 
investment firm salomon inc but federal officials said present 
management at salomon was not involved in any alleged wrongdoing 
this is by far the largest civil penalty ever imposed by this 
commission said dennis klejna director of enforcement for the 
commodity futures trading commission 
the cftc which regulates us futures markets charged in a 
19count administrative complaint that philipp brothers and others 
engaged in several deceptive practices including the ractice of 
bucketing 
in bucketing a broker misrepresents trades by buying or selling 
futures contracts off the floor of a futures exchange while 
telling the customer the trades were made on the exchange 
in the current case the cftc charged philipp brothers told 
customers their trades were being handled on the coffee cocoa and 
sugar exchange in new york when the trades actually were handled 
on the exchange floor 
klejna said brokers who use the practice may avoid paying fees 
to the exchange 
customers never really held a futures position on the 
exchange said klejna they thought they did when in fact they 
had orders that were booked at the firm 
the customer nevertheless was required to pay the same 
commissions fees and margin collateral deposited to buy futures 
charged for properly executed transactions and positions 
according to the complaint 
about 100000 cocoa futures were bought or sold in this manner 
carrying commission fees of about 16 each or a total of 165 
million said klejna 
philipp bros said in a statement that the activities were 
inititally brought to the attention of the cftc by the present 
management of philipp bros as a result of an internal 
investigation current management subsequently cooperated 
thoroughly with the cftc 
klejna said one reason the fine was so large is that the alleged 
violations went on so long from july 1981 through september 1984 
the commission also alleged philipp brothers and others entered 
into improper prearranged trades and fictitious sales and failed 
to accurately prepare order tickets 
the affiliates phibro corporation and philipp brothers 
commodities corp both of new york and cocoa merchants ltd of 
london settled the allegations without admitting or denying 
guilt said klejna 
in addition to the companies five former employees of philipp 
brothers were charged in the complaint and have not yet settled 
with the cftc named by the commission were anthony hd weldon of 
london daniel f tulig of sparta nj peter gilliam of surrey 
england esther lander greenfield of monsey ny and mark

a soviet newspaper reprinted a time magazine 
interview with exiled author alexander i solzhenitsyn in which he 
calls vladimir lenin evil a shocking description for those 
who consider the soviet founder a virtual god 
publication of the article in this weeks masscirculation za 
rubezhom is remarkable both in its criticism of lenin and as an 
interview with solzhenitsyn whose writings were banned in the 
soviet union from 1962 until march this year 
in the past four months soviet journals have published two 
solzhenitsyn essays novy mir the nations leading literary 
magazine is preparing to publish excerpts of the gulag 
archipelago solzhenitsyns account of soviet political prison 
camps 
in the time interview solzhenitsyn said lenin was uncommonly 
evil when asked what he meant by evil solzhenitsyn replied 
the absence of any mercy the absence of any humanity in his 
approach to the people the masses to anyone who did not follow 
him precisely 
za rubezhom carried a comment on that reply 
an adjacent article signed by historian am sovokin said 
solzhenitsyn must have defective sight to ascribe such 
characteristics to lenin solzhenitsyn writes of lenin and the 
bolshevik revolution in a spirit of prejudice and intolerance 
sovokin said 
under president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost or 
openness former soviet leaders josef stalin and leonid brezhnev 
have been blamed for many of the countrys problems but lenin 
whose statue holds a prominent place in every soviet city was 
above criticism until june 
at that time a magazine published the late vasily grossmans 
short novel forever flowing in which he accuseds lenin of 
contempt for freedom and cruelty to his opponents 
the za rubezhom article also told soviets that solzhenitsyn 
still faces criminal charges for treason in his homeland 
in the time interview solzhenitsyn described the bolshevik 
revolution as a coup detat and said the bolsheviks themselves 
called it the october coup through the 1920s 
the nobel literature prize winner who was exiled in 1974 lives 
in cavendish vt he said in the interview that he will not return 
to his homeland until his soviet history the red wheel is 
published and available in every bookstore in the soviet union 
however sources in the soviet writers union which reinstated 
him in july said they expect solzhenitsyn to visit his homeland 
possibly as soon as autumn 
the soviet government has moved toward rehabilitating 
solzhenitsyn who is seen by some countrymen as a prophet of free 
speech and by others as an embodiment of of russian nationalism 
the writers union which publishes novy mir has urged the 
government to reinstate his citizenship

a federal judge has awarded 104 million in 
damages to alpo petfoods inc after ruling that ralston purina co 
made false advertising claims touting the benefits of purina puppy 
chow 
us district court judge stanley sporkin ruled against 
ralstons marketing campaign begun in 1985 in which the company 
contended that its puppy chow products helped promote proper hip 
joint development 
ralston will appeal the judgment the company said monday in a 
statement from its st louis mo headquarters 
sporkin also found that alpo made false claims when it 
advertised that veterinarians preferred alpos formula for puppy 
food by a 2to1 margin over that of the leading brand which was 
purinas puppy chow he didnt order alpo to pay any damages but 
enjoined both firms from engaging in false advertising 
ralston said its puppy chow diet helped reduce the incidence of 
degenerative joint disease and canine hip dysplasia which is 
incurable and difficult to treat 
with the exception of ralstons own faulty research there is 
no valid scientific support for the proposition that the 
nutritional balance in a dogs diet can affect hip joint 
conditions sporkin said in a 54page ruling 
the overwhelming weight of scientific research indicates 
that the conditions are hereditary in nature and are unaffected 
by the nutritional balance of a dogs diet said the judge he 
called the research in support of the companys claim inadequate 
and distorted 
ralston launched a 52 million advertising campaign declaring 
that puppy chow helps prevent chd 
sporkin said the company had withheld vital information about 
its research from the public from government agencies and from the 
court 
at least one ralston official said the judge ordered that 
certain adverse information by destroyed 
we believe judge sporkin simply failed to grasp either the 
facts or the relevant law in this case ralston spokesman patrick 
farrell said in a statement he said the decision would have a 
chilling effect on corporate research if allowed to stand 
in connection with alpos false claim that veterinarians 
preferred its product sporkin said the firm lacked 
substantiation for the assertion which was based on a company 
survey internal company documents prepared in june 1986 
acknowledged that alpo could no longer sustain its 2to1 
preference claim the judge noted 
sporkin also ordered both companies to send out corrective 
information and to pay attorneys fees 
the judges ruling made friday and issued publicly monday came 
in a lawsuit filed by alpo which is the secondlargest seller of 
puppy food in the country and a counterclaim filed by ralston 
ralston has been the leading puppy food seller in the country since 
1964

mom always told you that a smile and a 
kind word go a long way but in lexington good manners could help 
you keep your job 
courtesy is the new municipal watchword in this town that once 
cradled the american revolution and now prides itself on efficient 
accountable government 
it kind of puts our best foot forward fire dispatcher john 
soares said after giving an unannounced visitor a very polite 
welcome monday its looking at taxpayers as customers 
over the next year all 285 town employees will be required to 
take a courtesy course that includes telephone etiquette grooming 
tips and how to make the public feel like a valued client 
employees transferring telephone calls for example are taught 
to give a quick briefing on the caller to help minimize frustration 
when you pick up the call you use the persons name and you 
try to paraphrase the problem so they dont feel they have to 
repeat their story over and over again said fire chief john d 
bergeron a graduate of the course 
nice talking to you he said cheerfully at the end of a 
telephone interview 
lexington employees are getting the sort of training in customer 
service thats used by such businesses as motorola corp 
northwestern airlines and the papa ginos pizza chain said maya 
ollson president of the evergreen training and development inc 
the program is costing 50000 said town manager richard d 
white who is preparing to mail cards to all 30000 residents to 
find out whether theyre satisfied with service from city agencies 
this is more than a courtesy issue its a whole system of 
management said white we may get some pretty decent ideas 
from people as to what services we provide are absolutely essential 
and which arent 
ollson said although people may have gripes they dont report 
them because they dont know how or they dont think itll do any 
good 
because of the state budget crisis the town expects to see its 
state aid cut by more than onesixth this year white said cutbacks 
and layoffs may be inevitable 
customer satisfaction will be a factor when deciding where to 
cut 
if youre an agency that has a lot of complaints youre 
obviously a target when it comes to budget reductions bergeron 
said 
some town residents polled said they had never been treated 
rudely but they welcomed the reminders 
i think people who work in the public like that could always 
use a dose of treating people nicely especially over the phone

china is honoring its 298 million soldiers with 
awards books and movies to celebrate the founding of the army and 
polish the image of its troops as national heroes for crushing 
prodemocracy protests 
tiananmen square the center of studentled demonstrations and 
the military crackdown in june now is under military guard 
tuesday it will bustle with ceremonies marking the aug 1 1927 
founding of the first unit of what became chinas red army 
the festivities come amid an official barrage of praise for the 
estimated 150000 troops ordered into beijing to stop the 
demonstrations 
last week the central military commission awarded the title of 
guardian of the peoples republic of china to 12 soldiers and 
officers wounded or killed during the june 34 military assaults 
orders conferring the award signed by senior leader deng 
xiaoping urged soldiers to follow their example be loyal to the 
country and the people and dare to sacrifice for the interests of 
the people 
at an army day banquet monday defense minister qin jiwei 
toasted the army which he said faithfully performed its 
fundamental duty and glorious mission for defending the 
motherland safeguarding the peaceful labor of the people and 
serving the people wholeheartedly 
the fanfare has been building for days television programs show 
soldiers being entertained by singers marching bands and acrobats 
in programs attended by chinas highest officials 
numerous books movies and photo exhibitions have been produced 
showing the official version of how the army subdued the 
protesters the accounts of angry crowds challenging the armed 
troops express sympathy for the soldiers 
official reports claim that when troops stormed into beijing the 
night of june 3 they showed great restraint and fired only when 
provoked the government says more than 100 soldiers and police and 
about 100 civilians were killed including some innocent bystanders 
western witnesses however said the troops fired 
indiscriminately killing hundreds and perhaps thousands of unarmed 
civilians 
a peoples daily editorial claimed some civilians insulted and 
spat on the soldiers 
the young army men were angry and would not have tolerated the 
personal insults if they did not love the people it said 
but witnesses said one taunt from the crowd could draw a barrage 
of fire from the young recruits 
the army has had a reputation of closeness to the people during 
the civil war against the nationalist chinese the armys ironclad 
discipline won support among chinas peasants 
a slogan about the troops noted for rescue work during 
disasters and help in harvesting crops says the army goes with 
the people like fish swim through water 
during seven weeks of massive peaceful demonstrations before 
the crackdown people felt confident enough to approach soldiers 
offer them food and drink and lecture them on the armys 
responsibility not to hurt the people 
until june 3 soldiers did act with restraint there was 
highlevel opposition to the armed attack on the protesters and 
some units refused to take part in the end discipline and unity 
prevailed and the crackdown began 
for days afterward people expressed outrage at the violence 
now after almost two months of repression and arrests few 
chinese dare voice anything but the party line 
an uneasy calm has settled over beijing soldierswith automatic 
rifles are posted at only a few major intersections but roving 
patrols stop people late at night to check identification 
relations between the military and public remain tense martial 
law troops reportedly have beaten and kicked arrested protesters 
most troops keep a low profile occasionally emerging from bivouacs 
around the city to see tourist attractions

more federal money is needed to combat crack 
addiction among pregnant women and to provide care for addicted 
newborns and their mothers witnesses told a senate panel monday 
as a country we have fostered a spiraling legacy of addicts 
giving birth to addicts philadelphia social worker teresa ann 
hagan told the senate governmental affairs committee must this 
generation and future generations suffer due to our unwillingness 
to act with urgency 
sen herb kohl dwis chairman of the session said the 75 
million in federal spending on model treatment programs this year 
amounts to 10 each for mother and child 
the department of defense spends 35 million every single 
hour kohl said what has happened to our priorities here 
kohl said three to six cocaine babies are born daily in 
milwaukee alone and at one of the citys hospitals 35 percent of 
those born this year will test positive for cocaine hagan said a 
recent survey indicated that 16 percent of births in philadelphia 
hospitals were drug related 
gregory l coler secretary of the florida department of health 
and rehabilitative services said that in his state 2000 people 
are waiting for treatment at any given time and some simply give up 
and return to drug abuse 
he said the problem for infants born to addicted mothers is 
serious 
we see miscarriages malformed limbs and eightweekold babies 
who have not gained weight since birth he said 
sherry agnos wife of san franciscos mayor told the panel more 
than 700 drugexposed infants will be born in that city this year 
7 percent of all births citywide she said 18 percent of newborns 
at san francisco general hospital test positive for crack 
she said san francisco created a world model to confront the 
aids epidemic and it paid off she said aids costs are lower 
per capita in san francisco than anywhere else in the united states 
we can do the same with crack cocaine if we are given the 
support we need she said 
hagan program and clinical coordinator at the family center at 
thomas jefferson university said addition repeats itself from one 
generation to the next and is deeply rooted in the nations social 
problems 
she cited a family center study showing nearly 70 percent of 
drug addicted women were abused sexually before the age of 16 
compared to 15 percent of nonaddicted women 
eightythree percent of addicted women had a chemically 
dependent parent with 75 percent of those parents alcoholic in 
contrast 35 percent of the nonaddicted women had a chemically 
dependent parent 
she was accompanied by elaina wilcox a patient at the family 
center who said that she had started using narcotics at age 15 
after being abused and filtered through the child welfare 
system 
drug addicted mothers love their children just like any other 
mother she said 
minnie thomas an oakland calif social worker told the 
committee that her mandela house treatment center has only six beds 
for mothers and six beds for newborns and that young women 
sometimes call her on the telephone and beg for a chance to get 
into her drug program even if it means sleeping on the couch

many rural hospitals are losing money because 
their costs are too high not because medicare reimbursements are 
too low a government report concluded monday 
the report by the inspector general of the department of health 
and human services dismissed the belief by many in the hospital 
industry that the governments payment for medicare patients is 
jeopardizing the financial health of hospitals particularly those 
in rural areas 
hhs inspector general richard kusserows report said his 
offices study found rural hospitals that achieved a profit on 
medicare patients had lower costs than comparable hospitals with 
losses in the program 
in 1987 the most recent year for which data is available 956 
rural hospitals or 43 percent earned medicare profits while 1255 
rural hospitals or 57 percent had medicare losses 
since all the rural hospitals received about the same medicare 
revenues per patient the key difference was their costs per 
patient the report said 
nonprofitable rural hospitals are unable to make profits from 
treating medicare patients because their costs are too high the 
report concluded 
in our opinion unprofitable rural hospitals should not look 
to the medicare program for financial salvation the report said 
the report said rural hospitals losing money under medicare tend 
to be smaller than their profitable counterparts have fewer beds 
lower occupancy more staff per occupied bed and keep patients 
longer 
rep thomas tauke riowa cochairman of the rural health care 
coalition disagreed with the inspector generals conclusion 
saying rural hospitals are desperately working to keep their 
costs low and still are struggling 
its very clear that the current medicare formula is working 
against them tauke said historically rural hospitals have 
kept their costs down and as a result they are being penalized by 
the current system 
the hhs report said federal officials should encourage rural 
hospitals to consolidate with other underutilized facilities and 
to convert excess beds to other uses 
in the short run hospital administators must turn to such 
costcontrolling measures as ensuring that they keep patients in 
the hospitals no longer than necessary and employ only the number 
of staff members required to provide appropriate patient care 
the report said

outgoing customs commissioner william von raab 
took a few last jabs monday at colleagues who he says are not 
sufficiently committed to the war on drugs 
at the 200th anniversary celebration of the customs service in 
his letter of resignation an interview and a news conference von 
raab zinged 
treasury secretary nicholas brady his boss for allegedly not 
supporting him 
unidentified state department bureaucrats and their quest to 
make the world safe for cocktail parties 
political jockeying backstabbing and malaise in the 
antidrug effort 
and von raab said he toned his speech down at bradys request 
including parts of his resignation letter in his speech von 
raab said maybe it is time for the war on drugs to take its place 
as our nations top priority to interfere with other interests 
such as banking and third world debt 
about the only person exempted from von raabs lash was william 
bennett whom he praised as a courageous man 
in his own defense von raab said if we dared to speak out 
it was because those in our own government were too scared to speak 
up about drug trafficking by those such as gen manuel noriega of 
panama 
brady sat expressionless on stage through von raabs remarks 
staring at the washington monument in his own comments brady 
praised interagency cooperation and said the drug war is a war we 
are going to win 
von raab did not shake hands with brady at the close of the 
ceremony though he did with many others 
the customs commissioner denied reappointment by president bush 
to the job he has held for eight years has been sharply critical 
of other officials in recent interviews he said monday was his 
last day on the job 
im quitting obviously because im not getting along with 
secretary brady von raab told reporters 
the commissioner said brady had stopped the policy of zero 
tolerance of drug users and traffickers that had resulted in one 
case in the seizure of a yacht because of the presence of one 
marijuana cigarette 
in addition von raab said brady had refused to go along with 
his plan to offer a bounty for the seizure of drug kingpins abroad 
and he criticized the lack of discussion of the drug problem when 
the united states and mexico negotiated a debtrelief plan 
but assistant secretary of the treasury roger bolton said in an 
interview that congress not brady modified the zero tolerance 
policy and a treasury official has forwarded von raabs bounty 
proposal with a pretty strong recommendation to bennett 
bolton confirmed that the drug issue did not come up in the 
mexican debt negotiations 
although von raab said brady is an honorable man hes a 
gentleman he noted that brady did not mention his imminent 
departure during the ceremony 
asked later whether it wasnt disingenuous of him to claim he 
couldnt understand bradys lack of warmth in light of his recent 
statements and his resignation letter von raab simply shrugged 
smiled and walked away 
bolton confirmed that brady asked von raab to soften his speech 
an early draft he said included direct criticism of other 
departments such as state commerce and justice which were not 
the treasury departments views 
von raab said he plans to take a month off then return to 
washington to see if anybody wants to employ me he did not 
respond when asked if he planned to run for office

the energy department proposes to spend as 
much as 172 billion over the next five years to begin cleaning up 
the nations nuclear weapons production plants so they meet 
environmental concerns department sources said monday 
energy secretary james watkins is expected to provide a 
blueprint of the fiveyear cleanup program in a speech before the 
national press club on tuesday including the expected cost 
estimates for the first five years 
the fiveyear program details of which will be announced later 
this month is the center of a longterm plan to restore confidence 
in the weapons plants and their operation 
the department has said in the past that the overall cleaup bill 
for the 17 plants in a dozen states likely will exceed 90 billion 
since watkins became head of the department last march he has 
had a team of senior aides develop a plan aimed at correcting 
decades of environmental and safety neglect at the weapons plants 
initial cleanup cost estimates over the next five years 
submitted to watkins are about 24 billion during the first year 
and as much as 37 billion a year during the subsequent four 
years according to department sources 
the sources spoke on the condition they not be identified by 
name watkins estimates were initially reported monday by the 
washington post based on an interview with the secretary 
department officials have refrained from attempting to gauge how 
long the cleanup will take and plan to develop specific action 
plans over fiveyear increments 
a series of incidents at some of the weapons plants has raised 
serious health and safety questions watkins has said past 
operation of the plants has failed to ensure the protection of the 
environment and public health and that public confidence in the 
program has eroded badly 
meanwhile the department announced monday that it has reached 
agreement with westinghouse electric corp on a joint approach in 
setting a schedule for restarting production reactors at savannah 
river the countrys largest nuclear weapons plant 
westinghouse operates the facility in south carolina 
the sites three reactors have been shut down for more than a 
year because of environmental and safety concerns the reactors 
produce tritium a radioactive form of hydrogen used in atomic 
warheads 
department officials declined comment on a report in the new 
york times that westinghouse had estimated the cost of repairing 
and restarting the three reactors would be as much as 166 
billion or more than four times what had been previously estimated 
according to the times the higher cost estimates were provided 
in a confidential report from westinghouse to the department on 
june 26 one department sources said that watkins had rejected the 
june 26 proposal because of both its high cost estimate and 
proposed restart schedule 
the department gave no cost estimates in its announcement 
monday but said the department and westinghouse had established a 
deadline of sept 1 for reaching agreement on a reactor restart 
schedule that would not jeopardize the weapons program or safety 
there has been concern about a shortage of tritium unless the 
reactors can be restarted in timely fashion westinghouse has 
indicated to the department it could not restart the recards before 
late 1990 a schedule that in the past has been criticized by 
watkins

a proiranian group known as the organization of the oppressed

william r higgins on monday to retaliate for israels abduction 
friday of moslem cleric sheik abdul karim obeid an hour after the 
reported execution it released a poorquality 30second videotape 
showing a man dangling from a gallows but there was no indication 
when the tape was made no body was found 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
state department officials said they found reports that the man 
in the videotape was higgins to be credible but could not say 
whether it was made monday or earlier arab analysts in israel said 
israeli and other intelligence services and un officials had 
received reports recently indicating higgins was killed in july 
1988 or in december 1988 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a group known as the revolutionary justice organization gave a 
statement to a beirut newspaper with a photograph of joseph james 
cicippio and said it would kill the 58yearold american unless 
israel freed obeid by 11 am edt tuesday 
an anonymous caller claiming to speak for the organization of 
the oppressed on earth telephoned the nicosia cyprus office of 
the associated press and said it would kill anglican church envoy 
terry waite on tuesday unless obeid was released it could not be 
verified if the caller was from the organization 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the israeli army said obeid had confessed to personal 
involvement in planning guiding and aiding the abduction of 
higgins and he revealed the names of higgins captors 
a spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir said israel 
remains ready to trade obeid for israeli and western hostages 
foreign minister moshe arens reacted cautiously to higgins 
reported execution saying we have no proof

president bush cut short a trip to chicago and met with his 
national security advisers although he cautioned he had no 
confirmation of higgins execution he said i know i speak for 
all here when i try to express to the american people the sense of 
outrage that we all feel about this kind of brutality this 
uncalledfor terrorism 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
congressional reaction ranged from calls for revenge to warnings 
that such moves would only worsen conditions in the middle east 
and it triggered debate over israels role with senate republican 
leader bob dole saying perhaps a little more responsibility on 
the part of the israelis one of these days would be refreshing 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar expressed 
outrage and revulsion at the reported murder of higgins who 
commanded a group of un truce observers in southern lebanon when 
he was seized the security council unanimously adopted a 
resolution that condemns unequivocally all acts of hostagetaking 
and abduction 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
higgins wife robin said the reports from lebanon were not 
pleasant but she did not know whether they are true one thing 
i have learned over the past 17 months is that the truth is hard to 
find and it remains so 
peggy say the sister of hostage terry anderson urged a 
cautious response what we have witnessed in the israeli 
retaliation in kind for the kidnapping of their people is that 
violence truly does beget violence and that i hope the united 
states will use this opportunity for reconciliation rather than 
retaliation

there have been a few instances of attacks on tourists along 
the coast south of mombasa and in remote areas of the country 
including some national parks most of these attacks some of which

liberal democratic party leader ryutaro hashimoto 
who was considered the top contender to replace prime minister 
sousuke uno said monday he would not seek that office according 
to news reports 
hashimoto secretary general of the governing party made his 
statement after leaders of a key party faction decided not to make 
him their candidate the japan broadcasting corp and several 
newspapers reported 
the leader of the liberal democrats customarily becomes prime 
minister because of the partys majority in parliaments lower 
house 
leaders of three factions made their decision not to back any 
current or former faction members during a threehour meeting 
sunday at the home of shin kanemaru said hiroaki toshinari a 
party spokesman 
kanemaru is former prime minister noboru takeshitas mentor 
takeshita and hashimoto resigned from their party faction as part 
of reforms during an influencebuying scandal that forced takeshita 
to resign on june 2 
the decision not to back anyone was made by kanemaru who heads 
the faction and senior members ichiro ozawa and keiwa okuda okuda 
heads the partys parliamentary policy committee and ozawa is a 
former party deputy secretary general 
they made the decision because the faction had played a crucial 
role in choosing uno and his cabinet when takeshita resigned 
toshinari said uno announced july 24 he too would step down 
because of the partys losses in senate elections the previous day 
there also were reports he paid geishas for sex

reports that lt col william r higgins 
was hanged by his proiranian captors inspired outrage around the 
world monday and criticism of israels abduction a moslem cleric 
which caused the retaliation 
condemnation came from countries as ideologically different as 
britain and syria 
foreign secretary john major said in london that if the reports 
were true this is coldblooded murder brazen savagery of the 
worst sort and quite unforgivable 
syria which supported iran in its war with iraq said 
killing higgins who was not guilty of anything is a crime that 
violates all humanitarian principles and norms 
the american marines kidnappers who call themselves the 
organization of the oppressed on earth said they killed him in 
retaliation for israels abduction from south lebanon on friday of 
sheik abdul karim obeid 
israel has offered to trade him and other shiite prisoners for 
three israeli soldiers and other foreign hostages held in lebanon 
timur goksel spokesman for un peacekeeping forces in lebanon 
said if its true its one of the saddest days for all 
peacekeepers in the world higgins commanded a group of un 
truce observers in south lebanon when he was seized feb 17 1988 
iran did not comment immediately after the report but a leading 
official earlier had defended the kidnappers threats to kill 
higgins 
it is very natural that the islamic clergy and militant 
groups throughout the world will take action against the interests 
of israel and the united states interior minister ali akbar 
mohtashemi told reporters 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati said the threat against 
higgins has nothing to do with us we condemn any kind of 
kidnapping or death threat he said 
many officials questioned the veracity of the claim higgins had 
been killed monday which was accompanied by a poorquality 
videotape showing a man hanging from a scaffold there have been 
reports that his captors killed the american last year 
if it is true the news of the murder of col higgins can only 
inspire a sentiment of horror the french foreign ministry said 
monday 
nasouh majali jordans information minister said this is 
horrible before the report that higgins had been killed majali 
called the abduction of obeid an act of terror he said the 
israelis are condemning terror and they are using the same 
means he said 
foreign minister sten andersson of sweden said killing higgins 
was a heinous crime that should be condemned along with obeids 
abduction 
the un security council unanimously adopted a resolution that 
condemns unequivocally all acts of hostagetaking and abduction 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar expressed outrage 
and revulsion that an innocent man serving the united nations 
in the cause of peace should be murdered in this fashion

tried at the same time were sent to prison for terms ranging from 
10 to 30 years 
the latest reports indicated the communist partys central 
committee headed by by president fidel castro ordered the new 
crackdown 
dispatches from the mexican government news agency notimex and 
prensa latina the official cuban news agency did not say if brig 
gen jose abrantes fernandez the former interior minister and the 
others arrested would be tried

was replaced by maj gen abelardo colome ibarra cubas 
thirdranking officer after castro and his younger brother defense 
minister raul castro 
prensa latina said the others arrested in the latest action were

cubas economy the general a comrade of castro from the early 
days of the revolution had been decorated for leading cuban forces 
in africa supporting angolas marxist government

abrantes and the other nine for weakness and cronyism which 
caused serious problems to develop at the interior ministry 
it gave no details but indicated they either did not immediately 
report irregularities or were negligent enough not to notice them

bitter accusations against the khmer rouge 
dominated the cambodian peace talks monday with vietnam calling the 
radical communist group the most barbarous regime ever known 
khmer rouge leader khieu samphan in turn claimed that vietnam 
plans to exterminate the cambodian people and has no intention 
of withdrawing its troops from cambodia in september as promised 
diplomats from 20 countries joined in calling for a 
comprehensive peace plan but none of their speeches sunday and 
monday offered new proposals to end the nations two decades of 
conflict 
the conference expected to last a month continued behind 
closed doors later monday and immediately ran into trouble over how 
to begin work officials reported delegates had expressed hope for 
progress in the closed sessions 
points of conflict included disagreement over whether a 
committee should be established to hasten an end to the conflcit 
officials said vietnam and the vietnamesebacked government in 
cambodia contend the conflict is exclusively their affair 
french foreign ministry spokesman jean gueguinou said delegates 
would hold informal talks and reconvene tuesday when committee 
discussions of specific issues begin 
emerging as a critical point was the future role of the khmer 
rouge the strongest of three resistance groups fighting the 
vietnamese and the cambodian government 
the resistance coalition is supported by china and led by 
neutralist prince norodom sihanouk who believes having the khmer 
rouge participate in the government would be better than fighting 
them in the jungles 
almost all delegates at the conference reviled the khmer rouge 
which was ousted when vietnam invaded the country in december 1978 
the khmer rouge came to power in april 1975 defeating the 
usbacked government and killed hundreds of thousands of 
civilians in a nationwide purge 
the genocidal pol pot regime is the most barbarous regime ever 
known in human history vietnamese foreign minister nguyen co 
thach told the conference 
he said the khmer rouge should be eradicated definitively as 
were the german nazis after world war ii pol pot was the khmer 
rouge leader during the massacres in the 1970s he has resigned 
from most of his posts 
chinese foreign minister qian qichen cautioned that excluding 
any party from an interim government would be dangerous 
the reality in cambodia today is the simultaneous presence of 
four political parties each possessing its own armed forces he 
said 
qian called for the vietnamese troop withdrawal under 
international supervision to be followed by a fourparty interim 
government headed by sihanouk the parties would be the present 
cambodian government and the coalition of the khmer rouge 
sihanouks followers and an anticommunist force japan the west 
and noncommunist southeast asian countries agree on that approach 
vietnam the soviet union and the cambodian government reject 
inclusion of the khmer rouge 
if the procedural impasse is worked out three or four 
committees will focus on specific aspects of the peace process in 
closed door sesions 
the delegates reportedly have agreed on three committees those 
committees would discuss an international control mechanism to 
monitor the vietnamese withdrawal work out international aspects 
of the conflict and set up programs for returning refugees and 
postwar reconstruction 
disagreements were reported over a proposed fourth committee on 
an internal settlement to the conflict over who should head the 
committees and on a proposal to send a factfinding mission to 
cambodia 
several conference sources said on condition of anonymity that 
the khmer rouge were blocking agreement on a number of these points 
the atmosphere in the conference room is one of optimism 
there is a strong current toward a solution sihanouk told 
reporters 
on sunday secretary of state james a baker iii said we know 
the path to cambodian internal reconciliation is likely to be long 
and arduous but today we take the first steps 
sihanouk singled out china as the linchpin 
china can do a lot china can choose to stick with khmer 
rouge it is for china to decide he said 
western sources said that while it may be impossible to 
reconcile the cambodian parties in paris progress could be 
achieved on forming an international body to monitor the vietnamese 
pullout 
several ministers including those of china australia and 
japan backed a recommendation by un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar to dispatch a reconnaissance mission to 
cambodia immediately to lay the groundwork for an international 
control mechanism 
most nations favor un leadership of such a group but the 
cambodian government and vietnam oppose it the united nations gave 
the countrys seat at the world body to sihanouks coalition

the bush administration indicated monday 
it did not hold israel responsible for the reported execution of 
marine lt col william higgins by proiranian shiite moslems 
though the presidents spokesman acknowledged others concern over 
israeli actions 
higgins captors said they executed him monday in retaliation 
for israels kidnapping of a moslem cleric sheik abdul karim obeid 
in washington senate republican leader bob dole suggested 
israel should have exercised more responsibility but rep charles 
schumer dny said the blame has to fall on the terrorists 
themselves 
at the white house officials would not directly embrace doles 
remarks but press secretary marlin fitzwater said without 
elaboration it is fair to say that many people do share the 
senators concerns 
fitzwater said we would not make any direct comment on his 
statemnets other than to repeat the presidents words of friday 
where he said that he did not think kidnapping and violence helps 
the cause of peace 
meanwhile a senior administration official speaking to 
reporters aboard the us air force jet that was carrying secretary 
of state james a baker iii back to washington from a conference in 
paris said violence and kidnapping are not the route to peace 
in the middle east 
but when asked if statements both president bush and baker had 
made deploring kidnapping were intended as criticism of israel the 
official said i am not criticizing israel for what it did 
thats not the interpretation 
in any event the official said bush and baker did not want to 
deflect attention from what is the real problem here the 
outrageous and uncivilized behavior of the people who have taken 
these hostages held them and now by an unconfirmed report at 
least have killed a young american colonel who was engaged in a 
peacekeeping mission 
i dont think we ought to divert attention from what is the 
central issue which is that by speculating about something 
else said the official who spoke only on condition that 
reporters not identify him 
israel had offered to trade the cleric and other shiite 
prisoners for israelis and westerners held in lebanon but 
president bushs chief of staff john sununu said us ambassador 
william brown on monday morning underscored to the israelis the 
us position on hostage situations that the government will not 
negotiate with terrorists 
that communication took place before the israelis announced 
their proposal said deputy national security adviser robert gates 
at the white house bush spokesman marlin fitzwater said of 
doles criticism of israel it is fair to say that many people do 
share the senators concerns but he would not elaborate we 
would not make any direct comment on the israeli actions he said 
dole speaking on the senate floor in washington bitterly 
denounced israel for its kidnapping of the islamic cleric 
i hope the israelis would take another look at their actions 
which they must know in advance will endanger american lives 
dole said perhaps a little more responsibility on the part of 
the israelis one of these days would be refreshing 
he said the bush administration better have some understanding 
with the israelis about future conduct that endangers the lives 
of americans 
while israels motives to curb terrorism may be good their 
actions have consequences for americans because terrorists know 
the leverage is with the united states dole said 
an israeli official said obeid under interrogation had given 
names of higgins kidnappers as well as details about hezbollahs 
other operations and its links to iran 
its ridiculous to say that israel is responsible for higgins 
death we dont even know if its him and if it is when he was 
killed said the israeli official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
rep lee hamilton dind chairman of the middle east 
subcommittee said israel had failed to consult the united states 
before mounting its kidnap raid last week 
we would like to see israel bring us in if we are going to be 
in on the crash landing we would like to be in on the takeoff as 
well he said 
but rep schumer said blaming israel would be turning the 
world on its head israel is among the few countries seeking to 
fight terrorism 
rather than criticizing israel for the kidnapping of obeid the 
united states and other countries should be supportive schumer 
said theyre fighting the worlds battle when terrorists shoot 
at you do you just cower 
he defended the kidnapping saying it did not amount to sinking 
to the level of the terrorists but constituted self defense 
baker commenting as he left the conference in paris denounced 
the outrageous and uncivilized behavior of higgins captors

an angry mob shouted obscenities at a 
mental patient charged monday in the fatal stabbing of a 9yearold 
girl and state officials tried to explain why he was able to walk 
away from a state hospital 
david peterson 37 was being held on 750000 bond after his 
superior court arraignment on murder and weapons charges in the 
death of jessica short of wallingford 
the girl was stabbed to death in front of her mother and dozens 
of other people friday at a street fair in middletown the stabbing 
happened after peterson slipped away from the connecticut valley 
hospital also in middletown 
two police sharpshooters perched on a neighboring rooftop 
provided additional security monday while peterson in handcuffs 
and leg shackles was hustled in and out of court under heavy guard 
peterson appeared at the fiveminute hearing with a public 
defender and he told judge robert burns that he understood his 
rights 
burns ordered peterson to undergo psychiatric evaluation to 
determine whether he is competent to stand trial he is due back in 
court aug 14 
after the arraignment between 35 and 40 people shouting 
obscenities ran alongside the police car that took peterson away 
peterson was to be confined to whiting forensic institute a state 
hospital for the criminally insane in middletown 
he could face up to life in prison if convicted of murder 
state mental health commissioner michael f hogan called the 
stabbing the most devastating event in the hospitals 100year 
history but insisted that proper procedures had been followed at 
connecticut valley hospital 
hogan said peterson was not allowed to leave the building where 
he was assigned but on friday peterson apparently slipped away 
from the hospitals unfenced campus and took a bus downtown 
according to a hospital report other patients saw him on the 
bus and asked why he wasnt at the hospital he told them he was 
out on a day pass 
peterson bought a 37 hunting knife at a sporting goods store 
then attacked jessica moments after she walked out of the fw 
woolworth store nearby authorities said she was stabbed 
repeatedly in the face and neck 
in the wake of this incident we must conclude that tightening 
security for forensic patients is necessary hogan said 
patients are granted privileges under a fivestep program in use 
for years at the hospital in this central connecticut city 15 miles 
south of hartford 
from now on any changes recommended by a patients treatment 
team will be reviewed by a forensic psychiatrist hogan said 
this system has worked well for thousands of patients over 
many years and is used in many hospital but there is no question 
that it did not work in this case to prevent a horrible 
occurrence the commissioner said 
peterson was confined to the hospital last year for up to 15 
years after he was found innocent by reason of insanity on assault 
and burglary charges 
petersons first runin with the law came after he stabbed a 
fellow student at wethersfield high school in 1971 after that he 
was in and out of state mental hospitals several times said his 
sisterinlaw ellen peterson 
in 1987 peterson was arrested again and convicted of stabbing a 
man at a boarding house where he was staying 
funeral services for the child were scheduled for tuesday

peacekeeping force is stationed in southern lebanon where higgins 
was kidnapped by moslem extremists 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar speaking after the 
council meeting said of the reports that higgins had been 
murdered i have been told it could be him higgins because in a 
videotape of the purported hanging there are indications it 
is very much like him

higgins on tuesday but gave no details 
reports had circulated last year that higgins had been killed by 
his captors 
on monday while still in paris for a conference on cambodia 
perez de cuellar spoke with two iranian envoys and appealed to them 
to use their influence to avoid this crime

the united steelworkers union holds the 
chinese government responsible for alleged unfair hiring at the 
nations oldest steelmaker union president lynn williams said 
monday as he led a rally at the chinese embassy 
williams opened the international unions annual legislative 
conference with a speech then picked up a bullhorn and led 750 
steelworkers to the embassy during the evening rush hour to protest 
hiring actions at the former phoenix steel co of claymont del 
china international trust and investment corp a beijingbased 
arm of the chinese government bought the shutdown plant last year 
and named it citisteel usa it was citics first us manufacturing 
venture 
the steelworkers union initially welcomed the takeover but now 
claims the new owners reneged on a commitment to hire former 
phoenix steel workers 
of the 250 former phoenix workers who applied for jobs 
citisteel hired 38 of them for skilled positions the union said 
it said in a statement that the firm did not hire phoenix employees 
for the less skilled jobs that make up the majority of jobs in 
the plant 
the national labor relations board is investigating the 
steelworkers complaint that citisteel has refused collective 
bargaining with the union and has refused to hire people because 
they are union members 
like the june army massacre of students and other prodemocracy 
demonstrators in beijing the citisteel case is an example of 
chinese government ruthlessness williams said in an interview 
it is clear that the chinese government in the end is 
responsible citic is their corporation williams said 
peoples opportunities have been taken away from them theyve 
denied employment to people who have given their lives to the 
predecessor company and to building the steel mill he said 
in a news release citisteel acknowledged the protest but said 
the union had incorrectly claimed that the company was obliged 
to hire former phoenix employees 
citisteel said it needed flexibility in shaping its work 
force nevertheless it said 60 percent of its skilled hourly 
workers had been employed by phoenix and that it would recruit 
others for unskilled jobs

an advisory committee on monday recommended 
that the food and drug administration reverse plans to allow 
nonprescription sales of a coughcold drug because of its possible 
association with sudden infant death syndrome 
the agency had planned to allow overthecounter sales of the 
drug promethazine hydrochloride in multiingredient cold products 
for shortterm use 
but the fda asked its pulmonary drugs advisory committee to 
review the issue in light of a petition from the public citizen 
health research group and the university of maryland sudden infant 
death syndrome institute 
the groups said the drug which has been sold in prescription 
products since 1951 may contribute to some cases of the syndrome 
known as sids though it is not recommended for use in young 
children doctors do prescribe it for them for colic the groups 
said 
the advisory committee voted 71 to recommend that the drug 
remain a prescription ingredient said susan cruzan an fda 
spokeswoman 
she said committee members were concerned about a possible 
relationship between the drug and sids and that more study was 
needed to prove conclusively whether the drug plays a role in the 
syndrome 
the panel was also concerned about possible brain damage from 
the drug 
the fda will consider the committees recommendation she 
said the fda has to decide what the next step is 
the drug is an active ingredient in products sold under the 
trade name phenergan made by wyethayerst laboratories of 
philadelphia wyethayerst and other makers of prescription 
products using the drug agreed to withhold nonprescription 
marketing pending review by the advisory committee 
the health group and sids institute said that although phenergan 
is not recommended for children under 2 years old doctors wrote 
175000 prescriptions for the drug for that age group in 1985 
the groups feared the drug would become even more widely used in 
children if it were sold over the counter even though it would be 
labeled for use only by adults and children over 6

a lot of people have asked just what was the 
energy department thinking of when it spent 344000 mailing a 
26pound report on the super collider to 16800 people 
it wasnt money but rather a takenochancesattitude 
congressional auditors reported monday 
cost was not the primary constraint considered other 
priorities such as the desire to demonstrate full compliance with 
the regulations avoid public criticism or lawsuits and the desire 
to meet its timetable represented overriding considerations 
the audit concluded 
an overriding factor was to err on the side of least 
risk 
the super collider report which analyzed the environmental 
impact of the 44 billion atom smasher was sent to governors 
reporters school children libraries property owners nearly 
anyone who had written the department about the project signed a 
petition or even an attendance sheet at public meetings 
im sure most of them ended up in the trash said rep 
dennis hastert rill or at least holding up the christmas 
tree or doing something 
hastert asked the general accounting office to determine if the 
large mailing was necessary to comply with federal rules on 
environmental reports 
the gao suggested the energy department could have saved more 
than 200000 in mailing costs and prevented a lot of sore backs if 
it had trimmed the 8000page document limited the distribution 
and picked a cheaper form of delivery 
energy department spokesman jeff sherwood did not return phone 
calls requesting comment 
the report which cost 136 million to print bind and mail is 
an environmental impact statement on possible sites for the super 
collider in arizona colorado illinois michigan north carolina 
tennessee and texas 
the super collider is a 53mile underground ring of magnets 
which would whip proton beams together with 20 times the force of 
the most powerful exisiting atom smasher 
scientists hope to learn more about the nature of matter from 
studying subatomic particles created by the proton collisions 
texas was awarded the project last november 
hastert whose district was considered for the super collider 
said constituents started complaining nine days before christmas 
when about half of the 16000 reports sent around the country 
started arriving in suburban chicago 
one morning i received a panicked call from the postmaster in 
st charles illinois and he virtually had truckloads of this 
thing the congressman said he had to rent a uhaul and hire 
two people to get them around

department store magnate who wanted to build a summer home on land 
he had acquired in southwestern pennsylvania 
completed in 1936 fallingwater is considered one of wrights 
greatest architectural designs its cantilever construction 
anchored in mountain rock makes the graceful stone and white 
concrete house appear to be soaring over bear run a cascading 
stream near ohiopyle in fayette county 
in a poll several years ago by the american institute of 
architects forum the house was named the greatest example of 
american architectural design 
the elder kaufmann died in 1956 leaving the house to his son 
who used it as a summer house until 1963 when he donated the house 
and 1500 surrounding acres to the western pennsylvania 
conservancy more than 120000 people visited the house last year 
according to tom schmidt director of fallingwater 
kaufmann felt fallingwater was too great a work of art just to 
be possessed by a single person schmidt said 
its the only great wright residence that came into the public 
domain with the furniture surrounding land and the art collection 
intact schmidt said 
kaufmann became a leading wright scholar as well as a curator 
at the museum of modern art in new york city and an adjunct 
professor of architectural history at columbia university he also 
was a financial supporter of and editor at the architectural 
history foundation which publishes scholarly books 
his own book fallingwater an american country house was 
published in 1986 and is now in its tenth printing 
colleagues said kaufmann insisted that the junior at the end 
of his name be written with a lowercase j 
kaufmann had no survivors and no funeral service was scheduled 
according to mrs newhouse schmidt said a memorial service would 
be held at fallingwater next week

rescue divers lost their fight with time and 
hurricane seas monday and had to give up their search for 10 
offshore oil workers missing in a capsized rig in the gulf of 
mexico 
as soon as possible we will have people back on the scene but 
there is no way to do anything with the conditions out there 
said coast guard lt pat philbin 
the rescuers were stymied by 12foot seas heavy rains and 
60mph winds on the fringes of tropical storm chantal which was 
upgraded to hurricane status monday evening 
officials refused to speculate on the chances of survival for 
those who may have found air pockets in the capsized rig lying on 
its side in about 25 feet of water philbin said 
the chevronleased rig was headed to shore early monday to 
escape the storm when it capsized about 20 miles off the louisiana 
coast near morgan city said company spokesman jonathan lifa 
four of the 14 workers aboard were plucked from the water by 
fishermen and a coast guard helicopter said chief petty officer 
michael robling 
an air bubble trapped in watertight compartments would be the 
only oxygen for any survivors said lt steve hardy but he did not 
estimate how long any trapped crewmen could survive 
divers were unable to search the rig because of the storm he 
said the dive boat and a coast guard cutter stood nearby but the 
bad weather forced helicopters back to shore 
three survivors were taken aboard the fishing vessel spar royale 
for a trip to wine island pass and one person was taken by 
helicopter to grand isle hardy said none of the four was 
seriously injured officials said 
the coast guard said the rig a 72foot selfpropelled barge 
with jackup legs was owned by avis boug co of folsom and leased 
by chevron oil corp 
the coast guard recently began inspections of such vessels 
because of the significant casualty rate and monday was the 
deadline for applying for an inspection this company had applied 
lifa said 
the barge had been in 50 to 60 feet of water working on oil 
pipes on the seabottom the rigs legs which extend 100 feet down 
when when it is working are lifted above the vessel when it is 
underway hardy said 
elsewhere a worker on a chevron platform in the gulf south of 
new orleans died monday after he fell into the water while trying 
to board a crew boat but five other workers safely evacuated a 
dangerously tilted jackup rig off grand isle 
the jackup rig owned by atlantic amp pacific marine inc of 
houston was listing at a 12 degree angle at 5 pm monday 
thats a pretty good angle id say its going over hardy said

the four major american television networks 
showed videotape monday purportedly of lt col william r higgins 
hanging from a gallows though one used only freezeframes of the 
grisly image 
cable news network and cbs showed the video on afternoon 
newscasts while abc and nbc broadcast still pictures from the 
tape nbc later showed the videotape on nbc nightly news 
it is not gratuitous violence said steve haworth spokesman 
for cnn he said editors considered is this stark video 
necessary to tell the story and in fact it is everybody came to 
the same conclusion 
cnn anchor ralph wenge warned viewers the tape was very 
graphic 
on nbc afternoon viewers of special reports and short news 
digests saw still frames of the mans head and torso 
we felt that the picture we showed captured the essence of 
what was claimed to be happening said donald browne executive 
director of nbc news 
browne said the network showed only still pictures initially 
because it had had little time to study the full video and because 
viewers do not expect to see something so graphic when regular 
programming is interrupted 
it went ahead with the video in the evening because people 
expect in a story like that to see graphic material he said 
the network sent the full tape to affiliates should they decide 
to use more he said 
for a special report on abc during the day there was an 
editorial decision not to show the videotape just the still 
said spokesman scott richardson 
abcs evening newscast again only showed still pictures because 
as news anchor peter jennings told viewers the only difference was 
that the video shows that col higgins was swinging on his 
makeshift gallows when the tape was made 
our view of showing it is simply based on a gut reaction no 
need for us to help demean col higgins by watching him swing he 
added

cars jammed the coastal highway leading 
south from beirut as thousands more residents fled monday to escape 
shelling duels between christians and syrians that killed eight 
people and wounded 92 overnight 
im not going to return unless its all over this time said 
samiha rashdan a sunni moslem leaving with her husband and three 
teenage sons we returned from south lebanon last week only to 
get caught in the new mad shelling 
mattresses beds and other household goods balanced high on the 
roofs of many cars indicating residents do not plan early returns 
police estimated only 200000 of the citys 15 million 
inhabitants remain in the capital the rest have fled since syrian 
troops based in lebanon started battling gen michel aouns mainly 
christian troops on march 8 
since then 510 people have been killed and 2158 wounded 
late monday a car bomb exploded in moslem west beirut police 
said there were no injuries after the black mercedesbenz loaded 
with 88 pounds of tnt and parked near a highway intersection 
exploded and burst into flames they said 
a short time later heavy gunfire broke out around beiruts 
central prison about one mile from the car bomb but police said 
they could not immediately determine what caused the shooting 
police said the overnight battle that rained shells on nearly 
every neighborhood of the divided city was one of the worst in 
lebanons 14year civil war 
it looks like both sides are bent on destroying beirut this 
is a scorchedearth bombardment rarely matched in previous civil 
war rounds said the spokesman who cannot be named under 
standing regulations 
two hospitals in christian east beirut as well as the turkish 
embassy and the belgian ambassadors residence near aouns palace 
took direct hits in the bombardment from 5 pm sunday to 4 am 
monday said the spokesman no casualties were reported there 
the presidential palace in suburban baabda east of beirut was 
battered with sustained barrages from bm21 syrian launchers that 
spew 40 rockets a minute aoun 54 lives in the palace bunker and 
was not hurt the spokesman said 
christian gunners struck back with savage barrages from 155mm 
howitzers that set three gas stations ablaze in different 
residential areas of moslem west beirut 
the burning stations spewed balls of flames like firecrackers 
on nearby apartment buildings forcing residents to flee even from 
basements the spokesman said 
hundreds of stores and cars were gutted streets were carpeted 
with glass shards and debris broken electric power poles 
barricaded alleyways traffic was scarce 
among the wounded were six members of a sunni moslem family 
whose sixth floor apartment was struck by a 155mm shell 
we were all injured said issam ramadan 30 
his 9monthold daughter leila started bleeding badly i had 
to carry her in my arms and run for about two miles to the american 
university hospital with shells exploding around me he said 
hospital officials said the baby was recovering well after her 
head and facial wounds were stitched other family members were 
discharged 
west beirut residents meanwhile observed a strike to protest 
israels abduction friday of sheik abdul karim obeid a shiite 
moslem cleric in south lebanon the strike was ignored in the 
capitals eastern christian sector as residents packed groceries 
butcher shops and bakeries to lay in food supplies 
prosecutor general joseph freiha said monday that aoun has 
ordered a courtmartial of those responsible for a report by the 
privately owned akhbar lubanan news agency that his troops have 
acquired surfacetosurface frog missiles from iraq 
the agency is accused of distributing a false statement 
quoting lebanons ambassador to baghdad hikmat awad 
the report which said the arms are intended to boost aouns 
battle to chase the syrian troops from lebanon was published by 
several beirut newspapers sunday 
the frog7 has a range of more than 40 miles and its warhead of 
1210 pounds of high explosives could hit the syrian capital 
damascus if fired from the central lebanese mountains in the 
christian heartland 
iraq and syria are traditional rivals in the arab world and 
iraqi president sadam hussein is arming aouns 20000 troops far 
outnumbered by the 40000 syrian troops which first came to lebanon 
in 1976 under an arab league peacekeeping mandate

the army was called out monday to help battle fires raging out 
of control on thousands of acres in the west and crews set a 
1000acre backfire in an attempt to halt a california blaze that 
destroyed seven homes 
national guardsmen already were on duty in idaho and oregon 
residents were allowed to return to lowman idaho a small 
resort town that was largely destroyed by a firestorm that had 
charred 10000 acres 
my husband left in shorts and no shirt said 70yearold 
daisy oliver whose mobile home at lowman was reduced to blackened 
metal scrap we didnt get anything just what we had on our 
backs i dont know where well go from here 
hundreds of fires most started by lightning last week had 
blackened more than 110000 acres in five states since wednesday 
the weather improved in oregon with lower wind and temperatures 
and a forecast of scattered showers but firefighters in hardhit 
idaho faced temperatures in the 90s low humidity and wind gusting 
to 30 mph 
were in for a long haul said dave olson of the payette 
national forest where more 200 fires burned in central idaho 
its getting serious and its getting tough to deal with these 
fires 
more than 9700 firefighters manned the lines on the two dozen 
biggest blazes in idaho california and oregon washington state 
had an 850acre fire and montana had several small fires 
that meant manpower in the west was almost completely mobilized 
and managers at the boise idaho interagency fire center the 
nations fire command post called on the army and crews from other 
regions for help 
hundreds of firefighters were being flown to the command center 
from alaska the east southeast and southwest spokesman ron smith 
said and soldiers from fort lewis wash were sent to boise for 
training before being sent to the fire lines 
firefighters set off a 1000acre backfire monday near auberry 
calif in an effort to tame the last section of an arson fire that 
burned seven homes in the central sierra nevada and forced 
evacuation of 2500 people 
there were nearly 2000 personnel at the 11350acre blaze 
dubbed the powerhouse fire said us forest spokeswoman margie 
clack 
residents of auberry some 30 miles east of fresno were allowed 
to return home sunday but people who live closer to active parts of 
the fire were told to remain away at least one more day 
were not letting folks back in homes in those areas due to 
the intense buildup of smoke in the area and for public safety 
since there is lots of firefighting equipment moving on those 
roads clack said 
residents began to return monday to lowman idaho about 70 
miles northeast of boise 
twentyfive structures in the town which has a yearround 
population of about 15 but which attracts summer visitors from 
boise were destroyed late saturday and early sunday by the lowman 
complex fire 
due north in the payette national forest crews had prepared the 
mining hamlet of warren and its 25 residents against possible 
attack by the 4200acre steamboat complex of three fires 
there are engines in place there are pumps hoses foam units 
in place everything that can be done has been done said payette 
spokesman olson 
the lowman complex a system of three major fires in the boise 
national forest was the worst of hundreds of blazes burning on 
40000 acres of timber and range in western and central idaho and 
new fires blew up on nearly 4000 acres in the hells canyon area 
on the oregon border 
some 4000 firefighters backed up by idaho national guardsmen 
ferrying supplies and guarding against potential looting focused 
on 10 of the largest fires 
the lowman complex was a virtual firestorm generating cyclonic 
wind that witnesses said snapped some trees in half said 
spokeswoman pat entwistle 
a morning air inversion aggravated by dense smoke finally lifted 
enough to get retardant tanker planes back in action 
at least five major fires and several smaller ones burned out of 
control monday in eastern oregon last wednesdays thunderstorms 
produced about 7800 lightning strikes in the region 
about 30 ranching families who fled their homes and turned 
livestock loose in the face of a fire were allowed to return home 
monday in a rural area south of baker in northeastern oregon 
however about 10 families from a subdivision south of baker 
remained evacuated as the dooley mountain fire grew to about 17000 
acres said gay brockus of the us forest service 
fire coordinators focused on the dooley mountain fire biggest 
in the state and about 20 miles northeast where the canal creek 
fire grew to 8000 acres after moving out of the eagle cap 
wilderness onto private timberland 
you look out the window here and theres columns of smoke in 
every direction said kathy aplin a spokeswoman for the oregon 
department of forestry in baker 
about 1200 firefighters battled a series of 23 fires that 
charred 8630 acres in the glacier complex on the malheur national 
forest 22 miles east of john day in eastcentral oregon said 
spokeswoman barbara kennedy 
in southern california a 5845acre fire in the cleveland 
national forest east of san diego remained out of control monday 
but a 1200acre brush fire northwest of los angeles which earlier 
forced 100 people to evacuate was controlled 
about 1270 firefighters had the cleveland blaze about 55 
percent surrounded but us forest service spokesman chris cundari 
said there was no estimate on when the fire straddling san diego 
and riverside counties would be fully contained 
firefighters also extinguished a stubborn 10500acre fire near 
atascadero that had burned since late last week

the army said monday that a moslem cleric 
seized last week by israeli commandos in lebanon has acknowledged 
personal involvement in the abduction of lt col william r 
higgins 
it said sheik abdul karim obeid had revealed the names of 
higgins captors who reported they hanged the us marine officer 
monday 
an army spokesman said from first evidence from a continuing 
investigation of obeid and according to his confessions in the 
investigation it was revealed that the sheik was personally 
involved in planning and guiding and aiding the following terrorist 
acts 
the kidnapping of two israeli army soldiers rachamim alsheikh 
and yosef fink in february 1986 carrying out terror acts against 
israeli forces and the kidnapping of col higgins and his transfer 
to beirut and the hiding of his kidnappers in his home in jibchit 
during the investigation obeid revealed the names of the 
kidnappers and more details on the terrorist acts of the hezbollah 
organization and its connection with iran the investigation 
continues said the spokesman whose name was withheld in keeping 
with standing regulations 
a yearold interview was broadcast on israel television in which 
obeid supported the kidnapping of higgins claiming he was a cia 
agent who spied on the proiranian hezbollah obeid is a spiritual 
leader of hezbollah whose name means party of god 
avi pazner spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
the killing of higgins was odious and criminal if true but 
israel remains ready to trade prisoners for israeli and other 
hostages 
at this point we have no confirmation that indeed col 
higgins was murdered he said after higgins captors announced 
they hanged him monday 
they had threatened to kill higgins at 3 pm 8 am edt 
unless israel freed obeid who was abducted friday higgins was 
kidnapped feb 17 1988 
about an hour after the deadline the group calling itself the 
organization of the oppressed on earth announced it had killed 
higgins and released a videotape showing a body hanging from a 
gallows 
we have to be very cautious with a possible reaction because 
you remember a year ago the same organization said that they 
executed col higgins after the accidental shooting down of an 
iranian airplane by the us navy pazner said 
so we will have to look for further evidence to confirm 
whether such an odious and criminal act has been perpetrated 
on dec 12 1988 higgins captors said he had been sentenced to 
death but did not say he had been killed a diplomatic source told 
the associated press the united nations had unconfirmed reports 
that he was killed after the uss vincennes on duty in the persian 
gulf shot down an iranian jetliner july 3 1988 
israel televisions arab affairs analyst ehud yaari said 
israeli and other intelligence services and un officials had 
received many reports recently indicating higgins was killed in 
july 1988 or in december 1988 
the military often allows yaari interview guerrillas captured in 
lebanon or at sea 
foreign minister moshe arens also reacted cautiously to reports 
higgins had been hanged 
we have no proof he said on israel radio this 
information is from a fanatical organization which is not known for 
telling the truth to our great sorrow we are well acquainted with 
this organization 
pazner said israel was holding open its offer to exchange its 
shiite moslem captives from lebanon for israeli prisoners of war 
and all foreign hostages held by shiite groups 
the offer stands because we are aware of the precarious 
position of foreign hostages in lebanon and we are ready to do our 
share if it is possible to liberate them he said 
defense minister yitzhak rabin made the offer earlier in the 
day before the reports that higgins had been killed 
israel repeats its call for the release of israeli and other 
hostages held by shiite groups in lebanon rabin said israel is 
offering to trade prisoners detainees and hostages 
according to this proposal all the israeli prisoners and 
foreign hostages held by shiite groups in lebanon would be swapped 
for all the shiite prisoners kept by israel including sheik abdul 
karim obeid jawad kasfi and others rabin said 
israel accuses obeid of planning attacks on its forces in south 
lebanon kasfi was captured in lebanon in december 
security sources in lebanon estimate 5060 lebanese shiites are 
in israeli prisons 
israels surrogate militia the south lebanon army holds about 
300 shiites in a prison at khiam in south lebanon the militia 
helps patrol israels selfproclaimed security zone just north 
of the border 
in offering the prisoner exchange rabin said including hostages 
of other countries in the deal results from the fact that theyre 
also threatened by the israeli actions 
the 17 westerners missing and presumed held hostage in lebanon 
all or most of them by kidnappers loyal to iran include higgins 
and eight other americans

we are to put it simply in danger of fouling the nest 
sagan said 
sagan addressing a committee on the environment of the national 
governors association said potential damage to earth and the 
environment is too great to delay taking steps to reduce pollution 
and destruction of trees caused by global warming 
he said that if unchecked projected increases in the earths 
temperature due to increased levels of carbon dioxide and other 
gases in the atmosphere would lead to drought creation of new 
deserts and an increase in water levels that would innundate 
coastal areas 
it is a problem thats extremely serious and will not be 
solved by business as usual said sagan an astronomy professor 
at cornell university who has gained fame through his books and 
public television series 
he spoke as the the governors of new york new jersey and 
vermont released a report urging steps to combat the environmental 
threat posed by global warming 
democrats mario cuomo of new york and madeleine kunin of 
vermont and republican thomas kean of new jersey presented the 
report to their fellow governors at the national governors 
association annual meeting 
the report written following a conference sponsored last march 
by the three governors recommends a 20 percent reduction in carbon 
dioxide emissions by the year 2000 it also recommends elimination 
of chlorofluorocarbon production and use and improvement of fuel 
economy of new cars to at least 42 miles per gallon by that date 
kean said scientists are in agreement on steps needed to avoid 
the consequences of atmospheric changes due to pollution and said 
governors must help turn a scientific consensus into a political 
consensus 
we have to act now said kean otherwise well have the 
most studied environmental disaster in history 
in addition to those steps sagan urged further improvements in 
fuel efficiency increased emphasis on alternative fuel sources 
including solar energy and the planting of more trees to compensate 
for tree destruction taking place around the world

the house monday approved a 16 billion 
measure to pay for operations of the legislative branch in the 
coming year after making a minimal trim in its own electionyear 
mailing expenses 
the bill which now goes to the senate would provide about 125 
million for house mailing expenses over the coming year an 
increase of 130 percent from the current years figure of 54 
million 
this bill is a bit of an embarrassment said rep bill 
frenzel rminn mailing is the last black hole of congress 
frenzel said lawmakers are increasingly abusing their mailing 
privileges to ensure their reelections rather than simply 
responding to mail from home 
very few people ask for our newsletters so we mail them to 
everybody he said they dont write us and so we buy lists and 
send personal unsolicited first class letters to people who never 
communicated with us 
the bill pays for salaries of congressional staff members 
office expenses and related agencies like the library of congress 
and capitol police force for the year beginning oct 1 it did not 
include senate expenses estimated to total some 450 million 
which will be added when the measure goes to the other side of the 
capitol 
lawmakers voted 39210 to reduce from six to four the number of 
districtwide postal patron newsletters each house member can mail 
in each twoyear term but they left a loophole that permits 
continued unlimited mailings of notices for town hall type 
meetings 
frenzel said those mailings are being abused 
some of the meetings only attract two to ten people but the 
notices are mailed to 200000 people its a device to put their 
names in the mailbox and increase their name recognition he said 
rep vic fazio dcalif chairman of the appropriations 
subcommittee which produced the bill agreed mailing has become a 
problem but he said he was reluctant to curb what is for some 
lawmakers their primary means of communicating with constituents 
the house also adopted by 4058 an amendment by rep tim 
penny dminn to cut 10 million from the mailing account but 
such a move means little since congress routinely overspends its 
mailing account and adds money later to make up the deficit 
they also approved on a voice vote language requiring that 
massmailed newsletters be postmarked at least 60 days before an 
election that would eliminate the practice of lastminute 
newsletters that become tangled in production backlogs and end up 
being mailed by incumbents during the height of campaign season 
the house rejected by 246167 an effort by frenzel to cut 97 
million from the bill which would have held the growth in 
congressional spending to about the rate of increase in the rest of 
the government

the fbi will determine if a black 
teenagers civil rights were violated before he drowned while 
trying to swim across the rainswollen ottawa river allegedly to 
elude police an fbi agent said monday 
the fire divisions waterrescue unit was not sent for more than 
an hour including a fiveminute wait for a shiftchange to avoid 
overtime prompting demands by some city officials and civil 
rights leaders that city manager philip hawkey investigate the 
incident 
the fbi was asked to investigate by the rev floyd rose a 
leader of the interdenominational ministerial alliance a group of 
ministers active in civil rights issues rose contends that if 
robert thomas had been white rescuers would have been sent much 
sooner 
thomas 16 a high school honor student was among four youths 
who police say tried to steal several cases of soda early wednesday 
from a store near the university of toledo 
senior agent harold jones said the fbi will focus on whether 
thomas civil rights were violated before he jumped into the river 
were not going to look into the fact that he drowned and 
there may have been a delay in responding with rescue people 
thats not a civil rights aspect jones said were going to 
open up a preliminary investigation this week just to determine 
what the facts are to see if theres any reason to go any further 
with it 
agents will have 20 days to complete the investigation the 
results will be sent to the department of justice for a final 
determination 
city councilman jack ford demanded monday that hawkey answer 
questions about the incident rose also called for a city 
investigation 
its obvious to me that they saw a fleeing suspect rather than 
a drowning youth and that sometimes clouds your mind and clouds 
your thinking as to what to do next rose said 
thomas jumped into the river at about 6 am while being chased 
by a university police officer authorities said 
at least 65 minutes elapsed before fire division rescue 
personnel were sent out according to recorded conversations 
between fire chief william winkle and a dispatcher all fire 
department dispatches are taped 
the tapes indicated that a city police officer on the scene did 
not call for the rescue unit immediately and that winkle was 
reluctant to send the unit until he had arrived at the river 
once winkle decided that rescue workers were needed he ordered 
an additional fiveminute delay until the next shift came on duty 
saying he did not want to pay overtime 
winkle said he viewed his departments role as recovering a body 
and not saving a life 
the rescue unit was sent at 705 am but it took another hour 
before the crew began searching the water thomas body was found 
that afternoon 10 feet from where he entered the river 
police chief marti felker said monday that he would determine if 
police policies and procedures were followed and if any new ones 
are needed 
late monday hawkey and felker held a news conference to give 
the police version of the events that followed thomas diving into 
the river neither winkle nor any fire department spokesman 
appeared at the news conference 
the university officer john betori last week told reporters he 
warned thomas of the rivers swift current seconds before thomas 
dove in betori also said he saw thomas struggle and go under twice 
before disappearing 
chief felker however said betori told city police sgt dennie 
sehlmeyer the first toledo officer to arrive that he thought 
thomas had made it to the other side and was hiding under debris 
thats why they searched the riverbank before calling in 
rescue crews felker said telephone calls to betoris home 
monday were not answered 
felker said sehlmeyer cut down on confusion when he called for 
help on a nearby pay telephone instead of his hand radio the chief 
said the radio can only contact police and the waterrescue unit is 
operated by the fire division 
what he did actually helped speed things up because he didnt 
have to go through a police dispatcher he went straight to the 
fire dispatcher he said 
hawkey said he would investigate the incident but said both 
divisions correctly followed procedures 
we want to show the community that proper procedures were 
followed and diligence was exercised for the care and concerns of 
everybody involved hawkey said 
ford said he could not understand why more emphasis was not 
placed on saving the youths life 
throughout this i am reminded that individuals have fallen 
into the water sometimes for minutes and have been revived so 
time was of essence throughout this whole scenario and yet that 
thought never went through the minds of our officers he said 
the three other youths suspected in the theft remain at large

the british broadcasting corp presented a 
television program monday about salman rushdies novel the 
satanic verses despite a church of england objection that it 
might offend moslems 
the blasphemers banquet a 40minute play shown on the bbc 
national network had actors portraying historical blasphemers 
around a restaurant table in northern bradford reciting their 
writings portrayed were voltaire moliere omar khayyam and lord 
byron but rushdies chair was empty 
moslem religious authorities consider rushdies novel 
blasphemous to islam the author has been in hiding since the late 
iranian spiritual leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini urged 
moslems to kill him 
some of the 60000 moslems in bradford were among the first to 
burn copies of the novel in january 
the bbc said monday it wrote to archbishop robert runcie 
spiritual head of the state church of england saying the 
sensibilities surrounding the program had been considered 
carefully within the bbc and a great deal of advice had been sought 
on its content from both within and outside the bbc 
john lyttle runcies public affairs secretary said he wrote 
last week on behalf of the archbishop to bbc directorgeneral 
michael checkland expressing concern about the programs possible 
effect on moslems in britain 
lyttle said rushdie denied any intention of blaspheming islam 
and reforms in iran since khomeinis death made it the wrong moment 
to attack iranian fundamentalism 
neither he nor the archbishop had seen the program and their 
objections were based on advance information lyttle said 
we want to resolve the rushdie problem not inflame it he 
said

a top contra official on monday accused the bush 
administration of giving conflicting signals on its support for the 
nicaraguan rebels saying the confusion threatens efforts to 
democratize that nation 
the latest frustration for contra leaders came over an 
initiative by central american nations to disarm rebels camped in 
honduras prior to next februarys scheduled nicaraguan presidential 
elections 
while president bush publicly opposes disarming the contras 
before the vote at least one state department official oscar 
sereseres has told regional leaders the united states might agree 
to an earlier date said rebel director adolfo calero 
my belief is that these people dont know where they are 
going calero said of administration officials that shows the 
lack of a detailed and clear policy 
he said the confusion doesnt contribute to a good outcome of 
the summit of central american leaders later this week 
he also said in the past few days the state department tried to 
obstruct a meeting between the contras and internal nicaraguan 
opposition groups but the participants had gone ahead anyway 
its ridiculous that at such a critical moment there are 
persons in the state department who are trying to usurp policy in 
central america calero said i would like to hear a single 
voice we would like them to respect the institutionality of the 
resistance not undermine the resistance 
he warned that the confusion would have serious consequences for 
the effort to democratize nicaragua 
it will also have both human and political consequences for 
the fate of thousands of nicaraguans who have fought the 
sandinistas supported by the us government armed by the us 
government and financed by the us government he said 
the contras at present receive only humanitarian aid from the 
united states as part of a bipartisan foreign policy initiative 
aimed at achieving a regional peace in central america 
although many rebel fighters have abandoned the struggle 
thousands remain camped just across the nicaraguan border in 
honduras 
calero said the contras were aware of a proposal by honduras to 
enter the contra camps and disarm the rebel troops but said such 
action was not likely without the approval of all the central 
american leaders at the summit 
they are not going to do it on their own he said they do 
not want a confrontation with the resistance

landed in jail on charges that relatives said stemmed from a drug 
problem 
fodor 39 was being held on cocaine trafficking cocaine and 
heroin possession and breakingandentering charges after a judge 
refused to accept his offer of a 300yearold violin to guarantee 
bail instead the judge friday set 50000 cash bail 
on thursday chambermaids at a marthas vineyard hotel found him 
in a room that was supposed to be empty and called police who said 
they found 20 grams of cocaine heroin a hypodermic needle and a 
dagger in fodors possession 
a family member in new york who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said sunday the arrest likely stems from fodors drug use which 
she said may be rooted in the same intensity that fires his musical 
creativity 
the only explanation i can think of is that he does everything 
in a thorough way she said hes a genius in his work and he 
devotes all his energy to his work hes very intense in whatever

the message of dr t berry brazeltons new 
cable series on child development is let the child guide the 
parent 
for the lifetime network series called what every baby knows 
the first three years cameras followed the development of 12 
children for one year the 39 halfhour shows will premiere on 
lifetime on saturday 
i was very aware of how hungry parents were for answers to the 
issues that they expressed through worries about toilet training 
thumb sucking but underlying that are much more deepseated need 
for support and understanding and a cultural commitment to what 
theyre doing brazelton said in a telephone interview from his 
summer home on cape cod the pediatrician has been helping mothers 
with their children in a show on lifetime for six years 
the thing i want to achieve is to have mothers watch their 
babies and learn what their babies are trying to tell them if the 
parents watch they can learn 
called this generations dr benjamin spock brazelton is a 
clinical professor of pediatrics at harvard medical school 
professor of pediatrics and child development at boston university 
and founder and chief of the development unit at boston childrens 
hospital medical center 
heres a pediatrician whos 70 years old with one foot in the 
past and one foot in the future said chuck bangert who produces 
the series with lou gorfain and hank okarma 
dr brazelton is very practical his contention is that a baby 
basically will tell you whats wrong 
the basic thrust of the show is to trust your own instincts 
said gorfain 
we picked 12 families and mostly tell the story of their 
office visits to dr brazelton said gorfain noting that the 
cameras also show the children at home 
four children are featured in each age group newborn to age 1 
a time of discovery the terrible twos when they develop a 
sense of self and the third year a time of growing autonomy and 
socialization 
the families selected represent various ethnic and economic 
groups as well as a couple on the verge of divorce a 
singleparent family a multigeneration family working mothers 
and mothers at home 
the way people are willing to share their anxieties their 
concerns their stresses and let down their defenses in front of a 
camera is incredible to me said dr brazelton 
bangert said brazelton is a hero to many mothers women in a 
playboy magazine poll selected him as the man theyd most want to 
be shipwrecked with airline stewardesses always seat him in first 
class because they want to talk to him 
he believes in setting more limits for children than spock in 
fact the most common question he gets is about setting limits but 
he doesnt advocate spanking he says if you spank a child when he 
gets older he will strike someone who displeases him hes also a 
great advocate of grandparents he says children should have a safe 
place where they can occasionally escape some of the restrictions 
the producers passed on other advice from dr brazelton dont 
worry if the child doesnt eat vegetables as long as the child 
gets milk and multivitamins peer pressure will stop bedwetting 
quicker than anything else 
bangert and gorfain who have won six emmys have also produced 
the body human for cbs and trackdown a special about the 
green river killer in washington state gorfain said two 
viewers have led authorities to a major suspect in the serial 
killings 
theyre producing a show for abc about hunting down parole 
violators with avery brooks as the host code i an abc pilot 
about emergency medical services with pernell roberts as host and 
a cbs movie giving a fictionalized account of two producers doing a 
special about a serial killer

in cedar rapids iowa halfway across the 
country from hollywood lives a recent high school graduate with 
the perfect name for an actress annabeth gish 
she shares the last name of one of the cinemas greatest stars 
lillian gish and decided quickly on a career in movies but 
walking the streets she feels pretty much like any other resident 
even if some have not forgotten last years mystic pizza in 
which gish plays a baby sitter who falls in love with the childs 
father 
i was babysitting for this family at the time she recalled 
they saw this movie and thought uh oh i got a lot of 
razzing about that when youre in a high school environment and 
people are seeing you play an older character having more mature 
things happen its pretty confusing 
after her latest movie shag iowans may be tempted to award 
blue ribbons and break into dance upon spotting gish the actress 
plays pudge carmichael one of four high school senior girls in 
1963 who sneak off to myrtle beach sc in search of a last 
adventure before going off to college and the real world 
the films title comes from a popular dance that pudge masters 
i read the script and just fell in love with the liveliness 
gish said in an interview i wanted to be a part of it and did a 
lot of background on the shag becuase i had never heard of it its 
a very big deal down in myrtle beach and it kept getting more and 
more fascinating 
gishs brief career in show business has also been far from 
hollywood desert bloom her film debut was made in tucson 
ariz while mystic conn was the setting for mystic pizza 
shag was primarily filmed in myrtle beach 
i went down a little bit earlier and had the luxury of 
learning from some authentic shaggers said gish a proud member 
of the shag hall of fame it was a different experience for them 
i think they were a little bit wary of what this hollywood movie 
company was going to represent their dance as 
the cast includes several relatives of hollywood stars bridget 
fonda is the daughter of peter fonda and niece of jane fonda 
tyrone power jr is the late actors son page hannah is daryl 
hannahs sister and carrie hamilton is the daughter of carol 
burnett 
but gish is not related to lillian gish and set out to be an 
actress before even knowing the significance of her last name 
when i was in first grade i went to the halloween parade as a 
movie star when i was in third grade i wrote that when i grow up 
i would like to be an actress in the movies i was very into 
watching movies i really enjoyed reading aloud performing 
by the time the aspiring actress turned 13 she was fully aware 
of her namesake and wrote for advice 
she discouraged me from getting involved in the business she 
said there was too much talent and not enough work and it was 
better to stay in an environment where you where loved and cared 
for 
but the young gish had her mind made up she had been acting in 
community theater since age 8 and fell in love with movies 
especially the cary grantkatharine hepburn screwball comedy 
bringing up baby and lillian gishs silent classic the 
wind 
i think katharine hepburn was great being a strong 
individualized woman playing these great characters she said 
gishs stage debut however was more humble 
my first play was called wylie and the hairyman she 
recalled my mom was the hairyman and i was the swamp i wore 
tiedyed long johns but it was fun i got to gurgle and bubble 
she was soon playing real people and in 1986 starred as the 
perceptive stepdaughter of an alcoholic jon voight in desert 
bloom 
having that as my first experience was really a blessing 
said gish it kind of set my path in the right direction when 
youre surrounded by people who are passionate about their work it 
made all the difference 
she followed with hiding out and appeared on television in 
hero in the family an abc disney sunday night movie last 
year gish stayed in cedar rapids finishing her high school 
education this fall instead of heading for the west coast she 
will begin classes at duke university 
ive strived to maintain some normalcy in my life some 
groundedness gish said 
if i had have moved out to la which there were pressures to 
do and started working right away and given up on my education it 
would have been so easy for me to be corrupted or eaten by the 
sharks my parents are like my support system

gregg keplinger was noisily bashing in the edge 
of a piece of stainless steel tubing when it occurred to him there 
must be a better way to make a snare drum 
sprawled on the floor of his tiny house below interstate 5 he 
put down his 12pound sledgehammer and picked up a file 
after several hours the edge of the steel tube was shaped like 
an upsidedown u that held the head of the drum as well as a 
curved lip on an ordinary thinnerwalled drum shell 
when he assembled the drum and played it keplinger discovered 
he had made an instrument that sounded louder clearer and more 
resonant than any snare drum he had ever played 
it was an accident i had no idea theyd sound the way they 
did keplinger says of the first comparatively crude instruments 
he made 10 years ago 
around 200 snare drums later professional drummers consider 
keplinger one of the leading snare drum craftsmen in the united 
states and probably the best one working with metal 
he is the only one as far as drum experts know who makes snare 
drums of black iron and stainless steel he is one of the few who 
uses brass and aluminum 
keplingers drums are custommade and are regarded as the 
ferraris or lamborghinis of snare drums he has reproduced drums 
from centuries ago that replicate the original sound to the 
satisfaction of a classical musician 
it has warm deep fat tones it covers all the areas and its 
the loudest damn drum ive ever heard said dony wynn drummer 
for pop singer robert palmer 
wynn has two keplinger drums named biscuit and not 
fragile he plays them on palmers latest album and theyre his 
favorites of over 100 drums he owns 
other drummers who use keplinger snares include the grateful 
deads mickey hart john molo of bruce hornsby and the range john 
hernandez of the rock group oingo boingo jazz drummer art blakey 
and howard gilbert percussionist with the seattle symphony 
orchestra 
its a good drum i wouldnt be playing it if it werent 
blakey said 
it is very powerful and very exact said hernandez you 
can hear them from miles away they just sing 
the seattleborn keplinger was a drummer for a local group when 
he fell into crafting snares he decided he wanted a 6inch deep 
steel snare with six lugs not the usual eight and couldnt find 
one commercially 
lugs which are attached to the outside of the drum shell serve 
as mounts for hardware that tightens the drum head over the shell 
keplinger felt six lugs would give him a more open airier sound 
it was while he was making that drum that he stumbled upon the 
idea of simply filing the edge rather than bending it over he 
could do this because the metal he used was inch thick about 
twice as thick as a regular snare shell also commercial snares 
are almost always made of wood 
theres nothing inside the drum to disrupt air displacement 
its just an empty cylinder keplinger said and the thick rigid 
metal shell doesnt vibrate as thinner shells do 
the key to the quality of the drums is the shell both the grade 
of the metal and the machining at the edge keplinger has a 
trademark for the shell and sometimes sells just shells 
he started using tubes cut to size then switched to flat sheets 
of metal that he has cut to order rolled and welded the metal is 
11 or 12gauge compared with the roughly 22gauge or under 
onesixteenth of an inch of most commercial snare drum walls 
he files the edges and the snare bed by hand until it looks 
right the snare bed is a slight dip in the bottom rim of the 
drum shell the snare wires are stretched over the bed to give the 
drum its characteristic snappy sound a handheld awl and a drill 
press mounted on keplingers kitchen counter make holes for 
attaching the hardware he orders to a customers specifications 
from over a dozen commercial drum manufacturers 
each drum shell is dated and signed gregg keplinger on the 
inside only recently did he begin numbering them 
the entire process takes about four sixhour days to complete 
keplinger has made drums that range from three inches deep 
called a piccolo snare because of its higher snappier tone to a 
24inch deep tambour provencal a medieval snare that gilbert 
ordered when he couldnt find one in germany the last place they 
were made some music scores ask specifically for the instrument 
which sounds like a dry growl in a distance keplinger said 
all the recordings made by the seattle symphony have keplinger 
drums on them including a prokofiev piece that features a piccolo 
snare solo gilbert said 
some people dont like greggs stuff because its so heavy 
but thats what makes it generate sound you want it to go boom 
not clank said joseph montineri a wellknown wooden snare drum 
craftsman based in manchester conn montineri said he uses 
keplinger shells for some of his customers 
a 7inchdeep snare of brass weighs around 20 pounds keplinger 
recently started using bronze which weighs less than brass 
metal drums are also not for every piece of music wooden snare 
drums tend to have a more acoustic warmer sound professional 
drummers often have dozens of snares they will interchange 
depending on the sound they want 
keplingers drums range in price from 625 to 850 roughly 
three times the price of a commercial snare although less 
expensive than imported specialty snares which can cost up to 
2000 
although he advertises in modern drummer a trade magazine most 
of his business comes from word of mouth or appearances at the 
annual national association of music merchandisers trade fair the 
only commercial outlet for which he makes them is american music a 
small seattlebased music chain 
he is thinking of giving the whole thing up even after 10 years 
and a long list of prominent clients he averages about two drums a 
month and the work is far from steady the main thing for me is 
the quality the integrity i dont want to make more drums if that 
would change 
so he plays jazz and rock gigs circuses weddings and anything 
else he can to make ends meet hes 42 and has done nothing but 
drumrelated work since he was 18 
his oneroom house is full to the roof with drums drum parts 
and equipment for making and carrying drums 
you get a passion for something mine just happens to take up 
the whole house he says

inhouse comedy clubs are catching on as 
nevada casinos turn to lowpriced new comics to give gamblers a few 
laughs between forays at the slot machines and gaming tables 
this is definitely a trend that weve hopped onto said jim 
johnson marketng director for the flamingo hilton reno which 
recently opened a new comedy club 
theres been a resurgence of comedy all over the country it 
used to be in the times of jack benny and bob hope that comedy 
was big in entertainment now i think were back to that 
the lone exception to the comedy clubs recent success story is 
rodney dangerfield who got no respect in las vegas 
rodneys place a joint venture between the veteran comedian and 
the tropicana resort and casino closed june 25 six months after 
it opened when dangerfield and the club couldnt agree on a new 
contract 
we havent given up on the idea of opening it up again as a 
comedy club said larry lee director of entertainment at the 
tropicana were talking with six national comedy chains we 
could go with something else but were leaning toward comedy now 
because it worked so well 
the idea of using laughter to ease losing gamblers pain isnt 
new comedians have been opening for bigname headliners such as 
frank sinatra and sammy davis jr for decades comics who started 
out in nevada casinos and still play their showrooms include joan 
rivers bill cosby and jay leno 
more traditional production shows with their showgirls in 
sequins elaborate headdresses and little else also use comedy acts 
to break up song and dance routines 
but a few years ago in las vegas inhouse casino comedy clubs 
began popping up to feed a nationwide appetite for laughter the 
trend now has invaded northern nevada where casinos are leaning 
away from multimillion dollar headliners and production shows in 
favor of cheap laughs 
most unknown comics make a few hundred dollars for an appearance 
while betterknown entertainers such as saturday night live 
regular kevin nealon and night court bailiff marsha warfield 
receive paychecks in the thousands 
we were looking for a way to keep the customers on the 
property longer and to attract locals to the club said michael 
opton marketing director for renos ramada inn hotel casino which 
houses the comedy circuit 
at first we looked at a production show but we didnt have 
the room and we thought why not try comedy its cheaper too 
 
the reno ramada has run the comedy circuit for the past eight 
months and now has competition from the flamingo hilton reno which 
opened its comedy club july 4 
caesars tahoe at stateline nev on lake tahoes south shore 
has been showcasing young comics for the past few years in its laff 
trax ballysreno where the spectacular hello hollywood 
hello production closed out an 11year run in april is thinking 
of opening a catch a rising star as an outlet of the new york 
comedy club where amateurs are welcome to try out 
johnson said the reno hilton is giving the comedy club a trial 
through the summer to determine if it will attract enough customers 
weve seen slow steady growth since it opened johnson 
said but were not getting the traditional crowd outoftown 
tourists in their 50s were getting a much younger crowd and some 
repeat business 
in las vegas casino comedy tickles gamblers in such venues as 
catch a rising star at ballys and the comedy store at the dunes 
most of the casino comedy clubs rotate wellknown and new 
comedians every one or two weeks with two to three comics a night 
for a standard show lasting 90 minutes 
admission generally runs 810 and includes one or two drinks 
thats slightly more expensive than the twodrink price of a normal 
caberet show but far less than a showroom production where dinner 
and drinks can leave two people with a threedigit bill at the end 
of the night

as napoleon iii reshaped parts of 
paris mussolini an area of rome and stalin the center of moscow 
so too has nicolae ceausescu redesigned bucharest romanias 
capital 
in just five years 19 churches a synagogue and hundreds of 
private homes have vanished from the citys centuriesold center 
victims of a vision of grandeur now nearing completion 
on aug 23 a national holiday marking the 45th anniversary of a 
successful uprising against a pronazi government ceausescu and 
his wife elena will formally open the palace of the people a 
white stone structure of vastly surreal proportions topped by a 
triangular metal flagpole 
from this 20thcentury fortress the ceausescus will rule their 
land and watch over the top government and communist party offices 
housed in the palace 
the palace faces on the boulevard of the victory of socialism a 
threemile avenue that cuts defiantly through the old city center 
it is there according to ceausescus plans government and party 
officials who are now sequestered in cozy villas will inhabit 
40000 apartments in stylish 10story buildings they have risen 
in just four years and are now complete with groundfloor shops 
that stock luxury goods for purchase only by foreign delegations 
elaborate fountains play along the center of the avenue 
popularly called the boulevard of the victory of bankruptcy 
but behind the empty gleaming buildings wires hang out of 
walls bulldozers and cranes are at work and the whole project has 
an unfinished air that suggests it will not be ready for full 
habitation by aug 23 
at the 18thcentury antim monastery nestled behind the gleaming 
white buildings the synodical library looks oddly out of place 
bishop nifon of the the romanian orthodox church explained the 
building was moved a few yards so it could be preserved but not 
interfere with the new civic center 
he said a few churches not of too much historical 
importance were destroyed for the project while at least eight 
others have been moved so that they are now hidden behind the new 
buildings 
this reorganization of the landscape is going on throughout 
bucharest as well as the rest of romania 
city centers that grew centuries now contain heaps of rubble and 
dozens of impersonal new towers of concrete that outwardly fulfill 
the universally propagated ideal of transforming romania into a 
modern industrial society 
four settlements around bucharest have literally been wiped off 
the map according to western diplomats 
but travel throughout romania suggests to foreigners and 
diplomats that most of the 8000 villages designated for absorption 
into larger agroindustrial centers under a scheme to 
systematize the countryside will not be destroyed but simply 
slide into decay 
there had been fears in the west and particularly in hungary 
that thousands of such villages would be bulldozed under 
ceausescus plan 
in cities the modernization drive has destroyed hundreds of 
villas deemed too bourgeois in appearance for modern romania an 
estimated 40000 residents of the capital were moved to make way 
for the giant new civic center 
there are some benefits to the vast building program 
bucharest a city of 25 million now has a subway that anybody 
can use for just 10 cents as an alternative to usually jammed 
trolley cars and buses 
an artificial lake and swimming pool complex also have been 
built near one of bucharests endless highrise residential areas

it was not yet 7 am and a morning chill 
hung over the green meadows and gardens of this quiet town near 
snowcapped mount rainier 
roosters crowed and old dogs on front porches yawned to greet 
another summer day dairy farmer tom lacrosse was in his barn 
already hard at work with no reason to doubt hed be around to 
savor the warmth of noon 
a few minutes later a distraught man named kenneth gehring 
stormed into the farmyard with a rifle in his hand a few minutes 
later still four people lay dying lacrosse and his wife rutheda 
milk truck driver kirby hull and gehring who turned the gun on 
himself when he saw what he had done 
the violence was not confined to the lacrosse farm it shocked 
this town of 3500 touching everyone who knew the victims 
stealing from everyone who had cherished a peaceful life away from 
urban woes 
in a small community like this when someone is taken it 
takes a piece out of everyone here said neighbor karen stannard 
moving to the country does not guarantee a safe and sheltered 
life 
fbi statistics show that while big cities still suffer the 
nations highest murder rates rural counties consistently place 
second with a percapita murder rate outstripping the suburbs and 
smaller cities 
and thats just the average certain rural areas gripped by 
poverty low education levels and disruptive social change have 
developed what some sociologists call a culture of violence 
that sends murder rates rising high above national norms areas 
singled out include those populated by minorities that have 
historically been oppressed the black south hispanic southwest 
and the indian country of western reservations and alaska 
the latest fbi numbers available show that the nations rural 
counties reported 1233 murder arrests in 1987 for a rate of 57 
murders for 100000 residents the average rate for all us cities 
was 102 while the average for suburbs was 49 
rural murder shatters the idyllic image that many have of 
country life and indeed it bucks the trend of most crime most 
rural places have lower rates of theft vandalism rape and assault 
than do more populous areas 
murder statistics may differ sociologists suggest because 
killing can be a very personal affair 
homicide is something that typically occurs among people who 
have a close relationship with each other said kenneth 
wilkinson a rural sociologist at pennsylvania state university 
one theory holds that in rural areas people have a higher 
proportion of primary relationships an academic way of saying 
that everybody knows everybody elses business when life turns 
sour an individual may lash out at people he knows well and that 
can be almost anyone in the area 
wilkinson offered another possible cause the erosion of 
community bonds in rural areas 
the romantic images of the rural past indicate a closeness of 
community he said in contrast to our image of the way things 
used to be rural areas tend to have weak community relationships 
the small town once may have supplied most of a persons social 
emotional and economic needs but now country dwellers often must 
travel far to urban centers to satisfy those needs or leave them 
unsatisfied until that leads to violence 
such theories are unsatisfying when the statistics turn specific 
and the incomprehensible happens close to home such was the case 
june 7 in graham 
tom and rutheda lacrosse both 63 were wellliked and ran their 
farms as cleanly as their personal lives tom had operated his 
400cow dairy one of the countys largest for 23 years rutheda 
was judged young enough at heart to be elected queen of this years 
pierce county fair 
neighbors say they were people who wouldnt hesitate to help a 
friend in trouble and such a friend was eileen may gehring she 
had problems with her estranged husband kenneth gehring who was 
ignoring a judges order to stay away from his wife on june 6 
while his wife visited the lacrosses gehring arrived and drove her 
car away a sheriffs deputy gave her a ride home 
gehring returned the next morning apparently looking for his 
wife according to sheriffs reports gehring drove into the 
farmyard and confronted truck driver kirby hull outside the milking 
barn after some angry words gehring shot hull 
tom lacrosse and a farm worker rushed from the barns office to 
find gehring holding a 22caliber rifle gehring forced lacrosse 
into the farmhouse and there he killed the farmer and mrs 
lacrosse then shot himself in the head 
investigators said gehring had no criminal history and there 
was no indication the slayings were motivated by anything but 
unresolved anger over his impending divorce 
the frightening frequency of urban slayings has conditioned many 
people to expect such grisly events in big cities but its just 
not supposed to happen in a place like graham the rural murder 
rate while high spreads itself across huge and sparsely populated 
areas making murder in any one small town a rare event 
it can breed fear of crime and fear of strangers which 
wilkinson said is not only unfortunate but misdirected because 
when trouble arises usually the killer is someone you know 
after a slaying voters seeking a scapegoat have been known to oust 
the local sheriff who may be more used to investigating bicycle 
thefts than homicide 
in rural areas where homicides happen its wrenching 
wilkinson said people wonder whats happening to our 
community 
down at graham auto parts manager bob sorenson mourns the 
farmer who used to grab him playfully in a headlock until sorenson 
grew old enough to put the hold on lacrosse 
its hard to believe you could know somebody that long and 
that he could go so quickly sorenson said 
the funeral was weeks ago now and talk at the post office and 
sorensons store is back to the county fair and carburetors but 
graham will never be quite the same a measure of its innocence was 
stolen that day in june 
it has made us more cautious said karen stannard i think 
there are doors being locked now that were never locked before

mamie and earl pendleton live in a 
dilapidated trailer thats often too hot or cold and always too 
cramped but life is better than it once was now they have indoor 
plumbing 
it wasnt long ago the pendletons and their three daughters 
lived in another mobile home where a bucket was their toilet water 
was hauled from wells and five of them slept in a bed still 
theyre far from comfortable 
at times you can get so depressed and downhearted you can 
almost lay down and die mrs pendleton said its so hard to 
think about tomorrow because youre struggling with today at times 
i feel fortunate ive got what i got i feel guilty wishing i did 
have better i remember what i used to have 
in a way the pendletons reflect the progress made and problems 
that remain in rural housing millions of rural americans are 
housed better than they were a decade ago but millions more are 
trapped in substandard conditions unable to afford or find decent 
shelter 
youve still got 7 or 8 million people living without a 
toilet without a sink or running water in this day and age said 
bob rapoza the national rural housing coalitions legislative 
director youve got people living in shacks with no windows 
many of them dont have a regular stove they might have 
juryrigged wiring the basic things we take for granted they 
dont have 
the problem isnt as visible because we dont have rural areas 
in big media markets 
inadequate private financing budget cutbacks aging buildings 
poverty and isolation share the blame according to experts who 
say that one consequence is increasing rural homelessness with 
some people even living in abandoned school buses or chicken coops 
more rural than urban residents are homeowners millions also 
live in mobile homes which have contributed to the progress but 
theyre expensive to maintain and depreciate in value said joe 
belden of the housing assistance council which deals with rural 
lowincome housing needs 
the situation is improving slowly but theres still a great 
great distance to go he said 
a spending and construction explosion from 1970 to 80 halved 
the number of rural housing quarters classified as substandard 
still 1980 figures found 21 million rural substandard housing 
units remained and some experts say that number probably has 
increased because of farm troubles and the sagging smalltown 
economy 
incomplete plumbing is the biggest rural housing problem 13 
million homes were without it at the start of this decade 
living without basics can be devastating said david lollis 
director of the federation of appalachian housing enterprises 
people often are so beaten by their circumstances he said 
their health is destroyed its not only difficult to hold a 
job it makes it difficult for the kids to stay in school theres 
no place or light to study 
if youre a young girl with no water in the house to keep 
clean it has terrible negative effects on peoples 
selfesteem he said thats the kind of thing that makes 
them give up or destroy whatever hope they have 
areas in the worst shape tend to be the poorest smallest and 
most isolated where indians blacks hispanics farm workers and 
impoverished whites live 
a 1986 agriculture department report based largely on 1980 
census figures said substandard rural housing lacking complete 
plumbing or having more people than rooms was heavily 
concentrated in the southeastern coastal region southern texas 
kentucky west virginia and parts of new mexico arizona and south 
dakota 
but there are problems everywhere 
in new york substandard homes in rural long island can cost 
100000 said sue montgomerycorey of the new york state rural 
housing coalition 
in maine aging housing and rising land costs in vacation and 
retirement areas have squeezed out lowincome residents in parts 
of the west financing is inadequate to replenish or rehabilitate 
housing 
and in california and florida farm workers sometimes live in 
squalid dangerous conditions 21 people in one trailer 11 
sharing a cinder block room with an outdoor toilet 
factors contributing to housing problems include 
inadequate credit in rural america there is not the 
capital available in the banks and thrifts said frank destefano 
a staffer on the house subcommittee on housing and community 
development small rural banks are hardpressed he said to make 
farm loans let alone lending at the low end of the scale 
budget cuts the farmers home administration the lead federal 
agency providing financing for rural housing has seen dramatic 
cutbacks from fiscal 1979 to 88 congressional appropriations for 
fmha rural housing programs dropped from 38 billion to 18 
billion in loans 423 million to 2753 million in rental 
assistance and 514 million to 238 million in grants destefano 
said 
even at their highest levels the programs were never 
meeting the entire demand he added 
in january 1989 fmha had more than 14 billion in preliminary 
applications for rental housing but only 554 million in funding 
isolation the most remote areas often are bypassed because 
they have no public utilities and people are too scattered 
fmha requirements state you have to have basic services 
nearby said john johnson executive vice president of a virginia 
construction company and secretary of the council for rural housing 
and development 
marlyn aycock fmha spokesman explained if youre 25 miles 
in the woods theres no bus service no jobs the buildings end 
up being vacant and vandalized and the entire investment goes down 
the drain 
aging stock housing is falling into disrepair faster than 
its being built 
people in urban areas generally have a choice living in 
substandard housing or paying an inordinate amount of rent for 
something fairly nice johnson said in rural areas even if 
you wanted to spend 400500 there just is no place to live 
all of these conditions contribute to growing rural homelessness 
we dont have people sleeping on steam grates lollis said 
we have people living in abandoned school buses abandoned cars 
and farm sheds 
in mamie and earl pendletons trailer the front door is secured 
at night with a log and a broken back door is covered with a 
stapled tablecloth 
they cant afford another place on their joint annual income of 
less than 4000 hes a seasonal farm laborer she works parttime 
as cashier at a socialservice center 
in winter the pendletons their 7yearold twin girls and 
14yearold daughter haul mattresses into the tiny living room to 
sleep near the wood stove 
sometimes earl stays awake because mrs pendleton explained 
if the fire goes out youre going to freeze 
but theyre grateful because their old trailer was 
roachinfested unbearably hot and without water or toilet 
the nine years were like a nightmare the 36yearold mrs 
pendleton said wiping away tears 
she has worked to brighten their home with posters handmade 
curtains floral decorations and garage sale odds and ends if 
everything looks drab theyre going to feel drab she explained 
still she said i would like to have something better for the 
kids i would love to have a carpet its hard to get out when 
youre labeled poor the girls dont do as good in school they 
dont have confidence in themselves 
but she keeps pictures of unicorns on her wall my way of 
never giving up hope she said 
if you dont have hopes and dreams youll probably give up 
and end up in a mental institution im not going to give up

tom carew is an ambassador in the hollows 
and hills of central appalachia his credentials are hammer and 
nail his assignment wipe out third world living conditions 
it seems a daunting task in this corner of eastern kentucky 
where dirt floors leaking tarpaper roofs and rickety outhouses 
arent dust bowl memories but modernday realities for some 
folks heat is a luxury hot water a convenience beyond their 
modest dreams 
theyre on the fringe of the economy said carew director 
of frontier housing inc a nonprofit agency for lowincome 
people its third world living 
when youre living in a cold lousy dangerous house how 
happy can you be he added youve got to put up with your 
basic survival everyday 
carews agency is among hundreds of groups across rural america 
that build homes and bring hope to people whose shelter often is 
little more than a shack insulated with rotting cardboard 
illuminated by a bare bulb 
since 1974 frontier housing has built 165 homes and 
rehabilitated 75 others in a fourcounty farming and timber area 
where poverty rates range from 23 percent to 39 percent 
its just a start considering that in parts of this region one 
of every four or five houses is substandard carew said if were 
building 20 houses a year its going to take a long time 
still there are plenty of successes 
take ethel ward a feisty 64yearold woman who lives in this 
tiny community with her son daughterinlaw and granddaughter in a 
neatasapin threebedroom home frontier built in 1988 
they only have to look in their backyard to see how far theyve 
come there sits whats left of their old frame home two dark 
rooms with a roof that was caving in roaches rats one electrical 
circuit no hot water tub shower or toilet 
we didnt have enough room to turn around in i was afraid the 
house was going to burn she said but what could i do 
about it i wasnt drawing much income my boy a sawmill employee 
wasnt working much 
her daughterinlaw maggie davis said there was no privacy 
because the rooms had no doors no place for her 14yearold to 
study and no way to keep the house dry or clean because of leaks 
and bugs she feared would crawl on her at night 
when you dont have any hot water its kind of hard to do 
anything added mrs davis who suffers from high blood pressure 
you felt like your child wasnt clean enough she never did 
bring no one home she felt theyd go off and say something 
gayle and billy williams who live in a converted smokehouse 
about 30 miles away in midland also will see a change in their 
surroundings this summer when frontier remodels their house and 
adds a bathroom 
it will be mrs williams first indoor toilet shes 61 
weve managed it ok but now were getting older she said 
carew said many people in substandard housing rationalize their 
plight if you start telling yourself theres a better way to 
live you do yourself in he said its a means of survival 
helen barker knew life had more to offer but it always seemed 
beyond her grasp 
now frontier has built a house for her her husband danny a 
seasonal truck driver and their five children for 10 years they 
rented apartments some with broken pipes and without toilets 
after you have moved around so much the stability of a home 
means so much she said it takes so much worry off your mind 
seeing it built its like a dream come true knowing its going 
to be mine it tickles me to death 
the barkers struggle to pay their 150 monthly rent their 
monthly mortgage payments will be about 100 frontier which 
receives state and federal funds will pay onethird of the 
payments up to five years the barkers and many other families 
frontier helps receive mortgages through the farmers home 
administration 
for months danny barker would make nightly stops to check on 
the progress of the house and report back to his wife a few weeks 
ago they settled in their new home on a hill deep among the sturdy 
kentucky oaks 
mrs barker has many plans but says ill probably sit around 
with a smile on my face for the first two months

ellen dolan and joy jackson have lived 14 
miles from town and a mile apart since their teenagers were 
babies theyve been together through diapers drought and dark 
times in rural america 
now the two farm women have teamed up to sell popcorn to the 
united arab emirates ginseng to south korea taco sauce to saudi 
arabia hash browns to australia and oat bran to walmart 
they are the guiding force behind amtex a homegrown marketing 
firm representing small to midsized midwestern companies that 
mostly produce socalled valueadded foods 
in 1980 mrs dolan now 44 was a country girl who planted her 
peas and lettuce to suit her aesthetic sense dabbled at art and 
exchanged dishrags with neighbor women at a monthly coffee klatch 
her husband gary farmed 2000 acres with one hired hand and 
brought in 750000 worth of crops 
but by 1986 when amtex was founded by gary and some other 
farmers and businessmen the farm crisis had forced the dolans to 
buy back their home on the courthouse steps most of the machinery 
was gone so was the hired man gary dolan was starting over on the 
land and ellen dolan became without intending to or knowing how 
a fledgling entrepreneur 
a couple of months after amtex started its office manager quit 
and i was drafted to make this thing work because i was the 
only unemployed wife said mrs dolan 
i came in here with no accounts and empty files i couldnt 
run the typewriter i couldnt understand the concept every night 
id leave here crying i had no idea what i was supposed to do 
sell soybeans to japan impossible 
today amtex represents 41 companies and is aggressively looking 
for more mrs dolan and mrs jackson 37 who volunteered to 
help ellen get caught up and then we never did say they still 
havent made any money but they agree that every day they go to 
work they feel as if theyll land a big contract 
enthusiasm is the key to this were opportunistic were 
tenacious said mrs dolan we keep reminding ourselves we sold 
oat bran cereal to walmart if we did it once we can do it 
again 
it was their first big sale full of hilarious foulups and 
tough lessons 
i wrote sam walton founder of walmart a letter and told him 
about amtex then months went by one day i got a collect call from 
the head food buyer who wanted us to come to bentonville ark 
walmart headquarters and show him our products i told him id 
have to call him back because neither of us had ever driven through 
kansas city 
laughing hard at the memory mrs jackson said i panicked and 
told ellen oh no i can only drive to the missouri river i 
cant cross it it was like a phobia neither one of us had ever 
ever driven in freeway traffic 
but after giving each other pep talks they called walmart 
buyer joe craig back and said theyd come 
we drove through kansas city whiteknuckle all the way sick 
at our stomachs convinced we would die on the freeway mrs 
dolan said then we just knew wed never find arkansas then we 
were afraid wed never find walmart in bentonville which is 
ludicrous looking back on it because its as big as the un 
buyer craig now working in another walmart division remembers 
them as pretty sharp openminded and professional i was 
impressed with them from the beginning 
it took 18 months to close the deal said mrs dolan and in 
that time there was a worldwide oats shortage not enough cardboard 
to make the cereal boxes the original oat bran maker was bought by 
another company and joe craig was transferred 
along the way the women got to know every restaurant in 
bentonville and just about every walmart receptionist 
some days this job makes us crazy said mrs jackson and 
other days it feeds our souls 
every letter amtex sends begins good day from trenton 
missouri usa correspondence wings its way from a 10by12 foot 
cubicle on main street in this town of 7000 to countries all over 
the world as well as hundreds of potential domestic clients 
in return we get letters that begin an exceedingly good day 
from singapore said mrs dolan its a thrill because we 
dont send threeparagraph corporate letters we extend a hand in 
friendship and offer barbecue sauce on the side 
when we get an overseas call we tell em right off that were 
just two farm women in a small office and were just getting 
started so dont expect a huge staff with bmas from harvard or 
whatever those fancy degrees are 
added mrs jackson somebody in japan wanted an amtex flow 
chart i went home and asked my husband honey whats a flow 
chart 
they may not know the jargon but they put in 10hour days 
trying to market foods such as smoked meats bee pollen popcorn

the antiabortion movement won a victory in 
the supreme court that it may yet come to rue it could lose in the 
legislatures what it won in the court 
the court gave states additional power to regulate abortion the 
effect was to make abortion a live political issue on which 
candidates must take stands and on which voters will make decisions 
abortion now could become the sort of hot button issue that 
motivates people to vote on the basis of a candidates position on 
a single issue 
until now people who felt comfortable with the courts roe vs 
wade decision legalizing abortion had no reason to make a voting 
booth decision on that basis they liked the status quo and it 
didnt appear to be threatened 
the courts 54 decision this summer threatens it so does the 
prospect that supreme court decisions in three more abortion cases 
next year will permit further restrictions on abortion 
political scientist larry sabato of the university of virginia 
an expert on campaigns and elections says he is convinced that the 
vast majority of americans are in neither camp on the abortion 
issue and uneasy with both 
people are generally troubled by abortion he says they 
find it very unsavory on the other hand most people are reluctant 
to impose their own moral code on everyone else 
the consequence he foresees is that abortion will be tightly 
regulated in those states where public opinion is clearly against 
it and loosely regulated in states where it cuts the other way 
in the battleground states where opinion is closely divided 
he lists louisiana pennsylvania minnesota mississippi as among 
the key ones my guess is that they will not regulate abortion 
more stringently than now sabato says 
a dissenting view comes from gary bauer former domestic policy 
adviser to president reagan now president of the family research 
council a conservative lobby and think tank 
bauer like sabato expects the abortion rights people to get 
more involved in politics but he also expects the antiabortion 
people to increase their political activity for them abortion 
always was a hot button issue now the button is hotter 
before the court ruled people opposed to abortion saw roe vs 
wade as a fact of life they used to say we dont like it but 
what can we do bauer says 
now they know what they can do elect antiabortion candidates 
to state legislatures 
bauer says the new circumstances will make life difficult for 
politicians of both parties but the dilemma he says will chiefly 
be that of the democrats 
the democratic party wants to bring back the northeastern roman 
catholic voters and southern protestant voters who had been wooed 
away and now feel comfortable with the republicans these folks 
oppose abortion and will oppose democrats who support abortion 
sabato doesnt disagree thats the downside for the democrats 
he says 
but now that abortion is a live political issue it will hurt 
republicans the gops antiabortion position will drive away 
suburbanites and young people he says 
suburbanites and the young have been tilting toward the 
republicans they are conservative on economic issues and 
libertarian keep government out of it on social issues 
he expects that the abortion rights forces will grow that 
driving the issue into politics will push some people off the 
fence and into the prochoice camp especially young women who fear 
their rights might be infringed on 
when abortion was a theoretical concern it was much more 
unsavory than when framed as an individual right that might be 
taken away sabato says 
so far the evidence tilts toward sabatos side of the argument 
in new jersey and virginia the two states electing governors 
this year the democratic candidates are putting new emphasis on 
their proabortion rights stands and the republican candidates 
virginias j marshall coleman and new jerseys james courter have 
been waffling on previous hardline antiabortion stands president 
bush whose 1988 platform took an antiabortion stand has been 
quiet about abortion since the court ruled 
but silence wont work says deborah dodson another student of 
abortion politics she is a senior research associate at the center 
for the american woman and politics at new jerseys rutgers 
university 
i think when politicians have taken a strong consistent 
record on one side or another they risk losing their activitist 
supporters from the side they previously supported while not 
appeasing those activitists from the other side says ms dodson

school districts out in the country face a 
dilemma declining land values in many rural areas mean lower 
property tax receipts and yet at the same time states mandate 
classroom reforms that cost more in the third part of a series 
rural crossroads ap education writer lee mitgang examines 
whether reforms are actually reaching rural schoolchildren whove 
been labeled at risk

kindergartners at parkin elementary school 
have a favorite song 
do you know about scarcity 
yes we do 
it means you cant have everything you want 
this jingle was meant to be a jolly economics lesson for the 
6andunder set but it also summarizes some sober realities for 
the 350pupil school in a poor isolated farming community in 
northeastern arkansas 
the song also aptly describes the fix many rural schools find 
themselves in around the country at a time when the nation is 
clamoring for costly education reforms 
in recent years many states have mandated lower class sizes 
tougher teaching standards additional counselors and expanded 
curricula 
small districts everywhere especially in farm states where land 
values have declined in the 1980s say they are being pressed to 
the wall to meet such reform demands 
furthermore rural communities like parkin put the lie to the 
longcherished myth that small schools dont have such social 
problems as high dropout and pregnancy rates drugs and suicides 
our whole school could be called at risk said jeannette 
bennett principal of parkin elementary 
rural schools across the country have an explosion of at 
risk kids said doris helge executive director of the national 
rural small schools consortium which is completing a firstever 
national survey of the social and economic problems rural children 
are facing 
in rural communities you have wonderful creative people with 
wholesome values to help kids but you dont have the services you 
dont have the community agencies helge said 
in one of the few statewide studies ever conducted wyomings 
department of education reported in 1987 that up to half the 
children in that predominantly rural state could be considered at 
risk in terms of dropping out teen pregnancy illiteracy suicide 
or crime 
bennett said motivating her pupils is her biggest challenge 
the eventual choices for most of her youngsters threefourths 
of whom are black and 90 percent of whom are poor enough to qualify 
for free school lunches will be whether to continue school or to 
leave and eventually go on welfare 
life for many of parkin elementarys youngsters is so proscribed 
that many barely know of interstate 40 just 11 miles south of 
town many have never been to memphis tenn just an hours drive 
away 
starting in 1983 arkansas gov bill clinton enacted a series of 
education reforms in a state ranking last or nearly so by most 
educational measures clinton and the legislature agreed to costly 
reforms that mandated among other things higher teacher salaries 
and many more course requirements 
all 329 arkansas districts now teach advanced science math and 
foreign language barely half did six years ago the number of 
students taking foreign languages has more than doubled the 
collegegoing rate increased from 38 percent to 44 percent from 
1983 to 87 
but the clamor for reform placed many small arkansas districts 
like parkin in a bind 
either they must tax their impoverished residents to the limit 
to pay for new teachers and tougher standards or the state can 
force districts unable to meet the standards to merge or 
consolidate a dreaded step to many rural educators who feel their 
smaller schools have priceless virtues 
compounding the money woes of such districts the value of 
farmland has declined in recent years in parkin property values 
on which school taxes are based declined from 163 million in 1986 
to 139 million in 198889 in that period parkin raised taxes 
twice but school revenues from all sources still remained 
virtually flat 179 million in 198687 and a projected 172 
million in 198990 
like many isolated districts parkin has little or no industry 
to bolster the tax base townspeople here hope a planned state park 
featuring an indian mound will attract tourist dollars 
making matters worse the parkin district has been losing 
students a common rural phenomenon as families look for better 
opportunities average kindergartenthrough12th grade enrollment 
in 198485 was 928 it declined to 785 in 198889 each lost 
student cost the district 1785 in state aid 
im just sitting here said parkin superintendent joseph 
pete whitby to a visitor figuring out how much money im 
losing 
still under bennetts leadership parkin elementary seems to be 
beating the economic odds 
among her accomplishments 94 percent of the schools 
thirdgraders passed the states basic skills test this year 
compared to 29 percent four years ago 
one of her teachers eda claire rucker has won two national 
awards for developing an economics curriculum for thirdgraders it 
featured lessons about apples a local commodity 
we planted a tree we went to an apple orchard we learned 
about taxes we weighed the apples we didnt use textbooks and 
thats what the children like she said 
in years gone by there was no acountability i think we 
should be accountable bennett said teachers are made to feel 
more a part of a set of goals were all in this together i have a 
wonderful staff it wasnt always so 
teacher salaries top at 19800 meager even by northeastern 
arkansas standards but the starting salary of 16890 is above the 
state minimum 
thus when bennett took her post four years ago she was able to 
attract a younger eager staff of teachers most of them recent 
graduates whom she could mold into a corps with few bad habits to 
break 
with them she developed a theme of economics education that now 
permeates the curriculum 
louise webbs thirdgraders for example took their shoes off 
to see which countries they were made in the class then graphed 
the results a lesson that mixed social studies math and 
economics 
bennetts philosophy is that economics education is even more 
basic than reading writing and arithmetic because it teaches 
youngsters values choice and above all motivation 
the school brings in guests to help break down the isolation and 
inspire youngsters to achieve 
rodney slater a black state highway official addressed an 
assembly in the schools cafeteria recently and was asked by a 
fifthgrader if it was possible to advance in his field without 
graduating from high school or college 
slater who holds advanced degrees replied let me say that 
there is no field where you can advance without a degree education 
is like food it cannot help you unless you take it in

the traditional role of farm wives is a 
laborious fulltime job one study found that if paid an hourly

montana farm wife anne smith lives 100 
miles from home so her teachers salary can help her husband stay 
on his ancestral land 
iowa farm wife denise obrien commutes 160 miles a day so her 
family can keep its dairy herd and apple orchard 
the farm crisis of the 1980s has dramatically changed the 
traditional role of mothers wives and daughters in rural america 
for some its an awakening a chance to carve out a niche for 
others especially older women without advanced education who must 
seek minimumwage jobs far from home it is a wrenching separation 
from a peaceful lifestyle into rigid routine that has doubled their 
workload 
for generations farm women were stayathome helpmates who 
tended gardens canned food bottlefed sick lambs and calves 
supervised 4h clubs drove tractors at planting time and trucks at 
threshing time kept the books and generally provided a second 
pair of eyes ears and hands when husbands needed assistance 
a study of 330 nebraska farm women found they spent nearly 68 
hours a week at unpaid domestic labor worked an average of 22 
hours a week on farm chores and spent five hours every week in 
volunteer activities 
the study completed recently by wayne state college in 
nebraska found 37 percent also worked off the farm earning an 
average 160 a week for 30 hours work 
the survey concluded that farm womens total work excluding 
volunteer service is worth an average of 27446 annually while 
farm men contribute a median of 23672 in income for labor on and 
off the farm 
census data indicate that in 1986 53 percent of all farm women 
were in the work force compared with just under 23 percent in 
1960 of those farm wives working away from home 78 percent cited 
economic reasons for their outside employment according to a 
university of nebraska study 
i wonder sometimes how long i can keep this up said ms 
obrien who heads the rural womens leadership development project 
for prairiefire a farm advocacy group based in des moines 
i get up with my husband at 5 am do chores leave home by 
6 drive 80 miles to put in a full day here drive home do chores 
spend time with the kids and fall into bed by 1030 said the 
39yearold mother of three 
all of us working off the land are just trying to keep 
everything together bring in money keep the house clean keep the 
kids involved in activities pay extra attention to our husbands 
because theyre having a rough time right now were trying to be 
everything to everybody but its incredibly stressful 
ms obrien and her husband larry harris have a dairy herd and 
grow strawberries and raspberries to sell their apple orchard is 
about to mature they have struggled 13 years sometimes depending 
on food stamps for groceries to make a go of their farm 
we had this dream of farming organically and my assumption 
was that id always be farming right next to my husband said ms 
obrien sometimes when i have to stay home from work for a day 
and im out in the orchard i get this real longing and i think 
this is what i intended it to be like and i realize that when 
im home it depresses me because that is where i really want to 
spend my life in the orchard not in des moines 
ms obrien who grew up in atlantic iowa but had no intention 
of staying there until she met her husband said she believes farm 
women are willing to sacrifice their own goals for their mates 
happiness which i guess is very antifeminist 
but the question that doesnt seem to be surfacing is is 
this worth it or should we get out people are avoiding that 
issue especially women who are by nature protective and 
nurturing we know its something our husbands want to do so we 
dont think a lot of our own internal goals we just put up with 
the stress said ms obrien 
i think the couples that confront that issue and talk about it 
are on the road to breaking up their marriage 
texas agriculture department economist heather ball a farm girl 
who left rural idaho to earn a living in austin says america 
has lost nearly 600000 farmers and ranchers since 1981 and today 
farmers are going broke at a rate of about 2500 a week that 
creates heavy stress in rural families 
it also creates identity crises in a segment of society where 
family roles have always been clearly even rigidly defined 
because the farmer has been the historic breadwinner having a wife 
who brings in most of the money is like having a gorilla at 
thanksgiving dinner everybody knows its there but nobody will 
acknowledge it 
a recent sevenstate survey of 1067 farmers and their wives 
coordinated by the university of nebraska found that few wives 
believe they can share their stress with their husbands less than 
onethird said their families are helpful or supportive 
anne smith says she and her husband doug have wrestled with 
that crisis ever since she announced five years ago she was going 
back to college to get her degree so she could earn extra money 
id been commuting 50 miles each way to work as a secretary 
for 436 an hour then gas went up so i had to quit said anne 
31 of bainville mont i wanted to improve our situation but 
doug fought me tooth and nail i think he thought he would lose me 
so i did it on my own my mom and motherinlaw told me the 
only jobs for an educated woman around here were teaching or 
nursing so i decided to become a teacher i was tired of being a 
peon i wanted more 
i borrowed money from my mom and went to night school i did 
well and suddenly doug became my biggest supporter that was the 
first time i ever stood up to him and probably the last what i 
did was not socially acceptable everybody assumed i was leaving 
doug it was real hard on him 
embracing calculus and trigonometry at 26 mrs smith was soon 
getting 40 grades at minot state college in north dakota but the 
separation was wrenching 
there were some bad bad years there said doug smith in 
1980 he bought from his grandmother the land his grandfather had 
homesteaded in 1908 it was a terrible drought year in fact 
ive only had one good year 87 in the last nine

with his wife at school during the week smith became a 
parttime trucker hauling hay throughout the west when his wife 
graduated in 1987 the couple was optimistic about finally being 
reunited when anne got a teaching job close to home 
but the only job i could get was tending bar in bainville my 
depression was terrible id spent all this money doug was 
counting on my extra income which wasnt there and then there was 
no reward for all the effort 
for a year mrs smith searched five counties for a job finally 
she heard about an opening in flaxville mont a town of l50 
people 93 miles north of her home up near the canadian border 
competing against dozens of other applicants she landed the job of 
high school math teacher in 1988 
i teach 10 classes and im the pep club adviser cheerleading 
adviser national honor society adviser computer coordinator and 
junior class adviser said mrs smith i spend at least three 
hours a day preparing for classes have to be at school at 740 
am and usually get finished about 11 pm because of extra 
activities 
monday til friday she lives in a house owned by the school 
district which she shares with the football coachs family 
i enjoy my job but i want to be closer to home its just 
that there are no jobs and when one does open up there are 
literally hundreds of teachers trying to get it said the pretty 
outgoing woman who grew up on a north dakota farm after college 
i swore id never be separated from doug again but ive done it 
because ive had to 
its been good for our marriage in that its made us be more 
selfreliant but i get so terribly lonesome flaxvilles 12 miles 
from a movie or a grocery store our phone bill is terrible 
this year mrs smith bought her first new car a sports model 
her husband describes as one of them flashy singlewomen lookin 
things come friday afternoons during the school year mrs smith 
is in it heading home to bainville 
i never pay attention to the weather no matter whats 
happening im coming home to doug 
always alert for job possibilities closer to home mrs smith 
isnt optimistic shell find something soon she says shell keep 
commuting as long as she has to to keep them on the farm 
ive learned to love this place this is our dream if i could 
have my wish id be home and have a maid to come in and clean my 
house and all that then id just sit out there on that tractor

for centuries the pope was an italian who got around 
mainly in a chair toted by six other italians 
now pope john paul ii ranks as the worlds numberone 
jetsetter a supersonic pilgrim whose frequentflyer mileage on 
more than 40 journeys outside italy would take him to the moon and 
halfway back 
across 400000 miles in a little over a decade the pope from 
poland has carried his pastoral cross to 82 countries from 
argentina to zimbabwe from tromso norway only l375 miles from 
the north pole to tasmania at the bottom of australia from 
ancient izmir to modern brasilia 
british historian paul johnson says that in assuming the wider 
role of high priest of the planet john paul has been seen in 
person by the largest concentrations of human beings in the 
history of the world 
no rock group no politician no sports star has outdrawn this 
former actor with the prizefighters face craggy eyebrows and 
penetrating blue eyes who has ventured beyond michelangelos 
magnificent dome to play the superdome the silverdome the los 
angeles coliseum and soccer stadiums bullrings and race tracks on 
six continents 
two photojournalists luciano mellace who has been on all of 
john pauls trips and giancarlo giuliana who has missed only one 
sometimes argue with the other boys in the back of the vaticans 
chartered jet about the biggest single crowd they ever saw 
was it that 200acre former dueling ground in dublins phoenix 
park carpeted in every direction from the openair altar with 
almost half of irelands 4 million population 
or that billowing sea of bowing bodies stretching beyond the 
reach of their longest lens from the shrine of the black madonna at 
jasna gora in poland 
or those endless files of the faithful marching like armies of 
ants up the heights of santa anna mountain after the polish 
government failed to provide the promised buses canceled trains 
and even closed highways 
or perhaps the nearly 3 million mexicans who lined the roads 
from the presidential palace to the shrine of our lady of 
guadalupe picking up the paving stones where he passed 
these days no one around the vatican seems to know what became 
of the sedia gestatoria the portable throne airconditioned by 
handwaved flabella ostrich feathers that for centuries was the 
main mode of papal transport 
probably in a storeroom at the vatican museum ventured 
jesuit sesto quercetti program director of vatican radio who 
already is planning the october trip to indonesia and korea 
others are tutoring the pope in bahasa the official language of 
indonesia preparing cassettes for him to listen to while shaving 
or late at night after the last visitor has left 
at total immersion lunches they perfect his pronunciation 
and go over his speeches the way swedish jesuit lars rooth coached 
him for that june jaunt beyond the arctic circle 
although scandinavias catholic population of 200000 adds up to 
only a moderate turnout for his noon sunday blessing in st peters 
square john paul added five new languages to his repertoire 
danish swedish norwegian finnish and icelandic 
as it was for the twelve apostles language is a key tool for 
him spreading the message of jesus rooth says of this 
peripatetic pope who is fluent in nine languages and has preached 
in 40 others including swahili tagolog bengali huron and 
pidgin he has a marvelous ear danish and icelandic are 
devilishly difficult 
vaticanisti the scribes in the baroque press room at the end of 
berninis columns knew a rare linguist was in residence in the 
thirdfloor papal apartment when on the morning after his 
election the pope asked a swiss guard in german the way to the 
elevator then received the diplomatic corps in faultless french 
conferred with curia cardinals in perfect italian lunched with a 
spanish bishop dictated letters in english to fr john magee his 
irish secretary and at dinner sang sad folk songs with old friends 
from the nearby polish college where he still keeps his guitar and 
skis in a closet 
several good fridays ago john paul ii quietly relieved a priest 
hearing confessions in st peters and for several hours absolved 
penitents in portuguese hungarian polish and ukranian two months 
of intensive study enabled him to answer questions from students on 
japanese tv 
for months now a team of routing experts at alitalias 
headquarters in eur outside rome has been working out details of 
the upcoming asia trip with other national airlines involved and 
visiting each country in advance with vatican officals 
getting the holy father on the road is a fulltime job we 
begin planning seven to eight months ahead says pietro canale 
director of alitalias office of vatican relations who has been 
aboard every papal plane since paul vi went to the holy land in 
1964 some airlines are very efficient 
the pope is not a very demanding passenger he has yet to ask 
for special treatment or any favorite food there is no designated 
papal jet we use whichever jumbo is next in rotation the same 
applies to the crew except an extra officer is added in the 
cockpit and to the cabin staff 
it now takes but a few hours to reconfigure a boeing 747 for a 
papal trip fitting out the upstairs bubble with a 
curtainedoff bedroom a tiny dining alcove and a small office with 
a table and two chairs then affixing the papal coat of arms to the 
right of the door 
firstclass fare is put aboard smoked salmon caviar beef 
wellington estate bottled wines to be enjoyed mainly by the 
journalists and the entourage of cardinals and bishops the pope 
has a robust appetite but since he was shot in the abdomen during 
an assassination attempt in st peters square in may 198l he eats 
more sparingly

nicaragua is the only government that ever tampered with our 
broadcasts says vatican radios quercetti they even 
interposed the national anthem as background to our soundtrack 
at 69 john paul ii seems virtually immune to jet lag and as 
vigorous as ever if a bit more stooped and balding but both 
friends and critics are increasingly asking why he journeys on 
many say the pope travels too much the pontiff acknowledged 
in a talk to the curia then defended his trips as authentic 
pilgrimages to the sanctuary of living people of god many of 
whom could not afford to come to rome again he cited his 
namesake st paul i love to see you 
by ceaseless travel the first nonitalian pope in 450 years has 
made the church of rome less italian and more universal 
archbishop john foley the vaticans media chief summed up the 
popes global mission essentially it boils down to being clear 
on what your message is and then preaching it or selling it if you 
will to the faithful and those you hope will become the faithful 
those near john paul say he is convinced the virgin mary 
miraculously effected his recovery from gunshot wounds that would 
have been fatal to others to enable him to perform some asyet 
unknown mission 
but there is no end in sight for the world weary vatican press 
corps the word has seeped down the scala regia the staircase

editors note five centuries ago king ferdinand and queen 
isabella ordered jews and other noncatholics to either convert to 
catholicism or get out of spain the inquisition was the brutal 
tool to enforce that edict jewish leaders in spain today say that 
while overt antisemitism is now rare thanks in part to hardwon 
changes in roman catholic and lay teachings a negative image of 
jews lingers among many spaniards 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the first time samuel toledano came to 
spain he attended a clandestine yom kippur service in a private 
home in madrid fortyfive years later toledano worships in the 
modern beth yaacov synagogue and explains judaism on staterun 
television 
as the 500th anniversary of the 1492 expulsion of jews 
approaches spains small jewish community has won major battles to 
erase the legacy of the inquisition time must do the rest 
it has been a tremendous challenge and satisfaction to 
recreate a jewish life where it has been absent for five 
centuries says toledano a native of tangier born into a jewish 
family whose roots were always in spain toledano is the current 
president of the federation of jewish communities in spain 
although spanish jewish leaders say social and economic 
antisemitism is virtually nonexistent the negative image of jews 
lingers among todays spaniards despite hardwon changes in roman 
catholic and lay teachings 
we are living in times when the youth receive a different 
education than in years past they are no longer being poisoned by 
offensive textbooks says max mazin the former president of the 
madrid jewish community but its a question of several 
generations without doubt 
in 1962 toledano and mazin participated in the revision of 
primary and secondary school textbooks in which jews were portrayed 
as betrayers of spain at best and ritual murderers at worst 
riding the tide of the 19621965 second vatican council in which 
the roman catholic church publicly expressed regret for past 
antisemitism the men obtained official recognition for their 
community from the fervently roman catholic regime of gen 
francisco franco 
mazin a sovietborn businessman who came to spain in 1950 
headed the jewish community in 1968 when the franco government 
authorized the first new synagogue in spain since the 14th century 
and formally annulled the 1492 edict of expulsion 
until then only private worship of jewish moslem protestant 
and other noncatholic rites had been legally tolerated 
under franco who died in 1975 spain helped several thousand 
jews escape nazi persecution while the dictator himself railed 
against the judeomasoniccommunist conspiracy 
an estimated 12000 jews live in spain half in madrid and 
barcelona the countrys two largest cities according to toledano 
the country has five fulltime rabbis 
like toledano most of the jews are nationalized spaniards who 
came here in the 1950s and 1960s from morocco where descendants 
of jews expelled from spain known as sephardim after the hebrew 
name for spain maintained jewishspanish customs and language 
other significant jewish centers in spain include the 
mediterranean resort cities of malaga and palma where many members 
are northern european retirees and the spanish north african 
enclaves of ceuta and melilla 
in march 1492 king ferdinand and queen isabella gave jews and 
other noncatholics four months to leave the country as part of 
their design to unify the country under a single religion 
the august 3 deadline coincided with the day christopher 
columbus set sail on his first transatlantic voyage paid for in 
part by jewish financiers 
for a thousand years before that the jews had lived a 
flourishing if precarious existence under a succession of roman 
visigothic islamic and catholic rulers whom they served as 
physicians ministers moneylenders and tax collectors 
the era called the golden age by jewish scholars also 
produced artists and scholars such as moses maimonides a 
12thcentury physicianphilosopher born in cordoba and judah ha 
levi the first lyric poet to write in spanish 
the first in a series of blows that would prove fatal to jewish 
culture on the iberian peninsula was a series of pogroms in 1391 
that whittled down spains jewish population by as much as a third 
between deaths exiles and conversions 
ferdinand and isabella appealed to pope sixtus iv for the 
creation of a special commission to root out dissidents as they 
fought to wrest control of spain from the moslems who had ruled 
nearly half the country for 800 years 
established in 1478 the inquisition became notorious first for 
its forced conversions of jews and later for its use of torture to 
extract confessions from backsliding new christian converts to 
catholicism and other supposed heretics

although the inquisitions power waned over the centuries it 
instilled spanish society with a fear of impure bloodlines and 
nonconformist behavior that lasted long after the last heretic was 
handed over to the government for relaxation at the stake 
on the spanish mediterranean island of majorca for example the 
descendants of 15 new christians who survived a 1691 autodafe as 
acts of public penitence were called are still singled out as 
jews despite their centuries of devotion to catholicism 
until the 1950s people bearing one of these xueta surnames 
were excluded from certain professions and shunned as unsuitable 
marriage partners by their fellow majorcans 
some spaniards spoke of encouraging sephardic jews to return as 
early as 1869 when the constitution of the first republic included 
a clause permitting private worship 
but little came of their efforts until nearly a century later 
now toledano hopes sepharad 92 the socialist governments 
planned commemoration of the expulsion will teach spaniards about 
the largely forgotten role of jews in the development of spanish 
culture 
there has been a concerted effort to deny the jewish and 
moslem contribution to spanish civilization that endures to this 
very day toledano says the attitude toward jews was based on 
ignorance and myth and centuries of teaching by the schools 
activities scheduled for 1992 include the construction of a 
monument to multicultural spain a traveling exhibition on jewish 
culture essay contests on jewish history the planting of a 
biblical garden and seminars in toledo once a center of jewish and 
moslem scholarly life 
sepharad 92 has also acted as a springboard for other efforts 
such as the inclusion of a course on the history of jews in spain 
in high school curricula beginning this fall 
the next step will be to incorporate that course into the 
history books toledano says you have to turn back an attitude 
that has endured for centuries by working at the grassroots 
level 
both toledano and mazin emphasize that despite mythical 
antisemitism spaniards rarely express personal prejudice toward 
jews no spanish club would ever exclude jewish members nor do 
businesses shun jewish partners 
there is less social antisemitism here than in any western 
country except italy toledo says the fact that you are a jew 
may raise curiosity but not animosity 
but there is still work left to do toledano and mazin say 
despite the elimination of many antisemitic definitions the 
1984 dictionary of the royal spanish academy of letters still 
includes denigrating references to jews 
the noun judiada derived from the spanish word for jew is 
a bad actionthat was considered characteristic of the jews 
among commonly used spanish putdowns are perro judio 
jewish dog and marrano a term deriving from the castillian 
word for swine that once referred to jews converted to christianity 
and now means any scurrilous or dirty person 
more troublesome perhaps is the constant and repetitive 
identification of jews in the spanish press where dustin hoffman 
is a jewish actor frances jacques hachuel is a jewish businessman 
and israeli jets are jewish warplanes 
in a recent article in the weekly epoca about controversial 
commodities trader marc rich who gave up his us citizenship to 
become a spaniard rich is identified as a jew no less than six 
times 
the author also notes that justice minister enrique mugica 
herzog whose mother is a jew of polish descent has jewish blood 
in his veins mazin whom the author labels the head of a 
discreet and effective jewish lobby in spain is identified 
three times as a jew 
but mugica who is not a practicing jew says the labeling of 
jews and other groups in the press is a reflection of poor 
journalism and little else 
its not prejudice its simply a lack of intellectual 
discipline he says furthermore there is a long tradition 
here of using religion to camouflage political ambition 
i dont notice any antisemitism there are expressions that 
come from the old times but how are we going to give these 
expressions a political meaning 
mazin disagrees 
once you say jew you dont need to say anything else 
because its such a defining term you have to point out someone is 
a jew if you dont somebody might not know and confide in him and 
be betrayed later

the families of ramon aguilo and 
miquel segura have been churchgoing roman catholics for three 
centuries but that didnt stop neighborhood kids from taunting 
them as jews each day on the way to school 
since they were old enough to remember the two men have known 
their neighbors viewed them as different 
segura and aguilo are xuetas descendants of 15 stigmatized 
families who survived a 1691 spanish inquisition crackdown against 
lapsed jewish converts to christianity on this spanish 
mediterranean island 
the xueta pronounced chweta phenomenon is an extreme example 
of a spanish obsession with bloodlines that long outlasted the 
inquisition a papal commission created in 1478 to root out secret 
jews moslems and other heretics 
the xueta label has followed the two men into adulthood 
during a recent labor dispute striking garbage collectors added 
it to the list of insults they hurled at aguilo now the mayor of 
the capital city of palma 
a few years ago a news article showing the mayor donating blood 
carried the caption xueta blood no thanks 
majorcas prosperous jewish community like those throughout 
medieval spain ceased to exist in 1492 when king ferdinand and 
queen isabella issued an edict that gave jews the choice of 
converting to catholicism or fleeing the country 
jews of spanish descent began returning to spain from north 
africa after world war ii to join others who had fled nazioccupied 
europe but it wasnt until 1968 that the regime of gen francisco 
franco authorized the construction of a synagogue in madrid and 
formally rescinded the 1492 expulsion edict 
since most spanish jews changed their surnames when they 
converted it is nearly impossible for modern spaniards to 
determine their origin although many offhandedly claim some jewish 
ancese 
mother is a jew of polish origin 
samuel toledano head of the federation of jewish communities in 
spain says spanish catholics who recognize him from television 
appearances often approach him to proclaim their jewish heritage 
israels first ambassador to spain samuel haddas told a 
spanish daily in 1986 not a day goes by that i dont get a 
letter or phone call from spaniards asking if their surname is 
jewish 
but in majorcas closed island culture people with the 15 xueta 
surnames have been singled out since 1691 when a majorcan priest 
published the triumphant faith in which the names appeared 
until mass tourism began to dilute the islands culture and 
raise educational levels in the 1950s and 1960s the xuetas 
remained a community apart ostracized by other catholics and 
steered into certain neighborhoods and professions most notably 
silversmithing 
now half of majorcas 600000 residents are new to the island 
there are no reliable figures on the number of xuetas but segura 
estimates there are between 15000 and 30000 on majorca 
few xuetas still live on the street of the silver shops once 
the center of their neighborhood although many of the stores still 
bear xueta names 
aguilo 39 and segura 44 say they belong to a transitional 
generation free of institutional antixueta prejudices but 
subjected to verbal abuse from their childhood peers 
the city has pretty much overcome this type of racism but 
certain latent tendencies still exist despite the growth of 
tourism says aguilo an agnostic 
segura the head of the local jewelers and silversmiths guild 
wears a heavy gold pendant showing a sevenbranched jewish menorah 
or candelabra and the majorcan coat of arms as a symbol of pride 
he says his children are generally unaffected by any lingering 
prejudice 
both are careful to point out that unlike the spanish mainland 
where centuries of antijewish religious teachings and a physical 
absence of jews gave antisemitism a nebulous quality antixueta 
feelings on majorca were directed at real people 
descendants of other converts gradually integrated into majorcan 
society their origin forgotten and the xueta surnames carry no 
stigma on the spanish mainland 
this has nothing to do with the peninsula it is an island 
issue prolonged by the insularity of majorca segura says 
what existed here was not a historic or mythical prejudice it 
was a real live hatred it wasnt even aimed at jews but rather 
at xuetas 
here religious prejudices became racial ones aguilo says 
the xuetas are as catholic as anybody else to avoid suspicion 
they were even more observant in public than others 
over the past 25 years a few xuetas have had an opposite 
reaction converting to judaism and moving to israel 
there are no xuetas among todays practicing jewish community 
here most of its 160 members are northern european retirees 
they conduct their friday night services in hebrew and english 
at a 2yearold synagogue tucked behind a highrise palma hotel 
and depend on members or visiting clergymen to conduct services 
jewish community president henry greenberg says he has seen 
little evidence of antisemitism on the island 
majorca is free of antisemitism except for a few youngsters 
who smear paint on the walls says the british retiree the 
roman catholic bishop helped inaugurate our synagogue basically 
its a wonderful environment

editors note the 40th anniversary of the death of gone with 
the wind author margaret mitchell is likely to go largely 
unnoticed in atlanta this week but a celebration is in the works 
for december marking the 50th anniversary of the debut of the 
film meanwhile those who knew her are waiting curiously for the 
publication of a gwtw sequel something miss mitchell herself had 
opposed

a tourist in search of margaret mitchells roots 
would have a hard time finding them 40 years after the author of 
gone with the wind died in her beloved atlanta 
frankly she would have liked it that way 
miss mitchell known for her love of privacy wanted her 
childhood home destroyed so no one could turn it into a shrine her 
wishes were followed and her hometown still has few physical 
reminders of its mostfamous writer 
the same passion for privacy was evident in august 1949 when 
miss mitchell died after being struck by a speeding car on 
peachtree street 
her funeral on aug 18 was open to 350 relatives and friends who 
received printed invitations it was a nineminute service followed 
by a brief graveside ceremony and the family declined flowers 
except for a blanket of blossoms that covered the top of her casket 
the authors brother stephens mitchell wanted to make sure 
the thing was held in good taste notsome sort of circus said 
his son gene who now lives in michigan 
but atlantans shocked by the death of the woman they knew 
affectionately as peggy would not be denied the chance to pay 
their last respects 
crowds stood outside the funeral home waiting with reporters in 
the heat to hear the service on loudspeakers others stood with 
heads bowed as the cortege wound its way to oakland cemetery where 
miss mitchell was buried beside her parents in a grave marked with 
a simple marble headstone 
there had been crowds too at grady hospital where miss 
mitchell lay in a coma for five days after the aug 11 accident 
curiosity seekers and fans descended on the hospital and family 
friends volunteered to help answer the hundreds of telephone calls 
seeking news of her condition 
nancy wooten a retired nurse who worked at grady during miss 
mitchells final days recalled that the windows in her room were 
kept tightly closed for privacy despite the august heat and the 
lack of air conditioning 
we had to go outside to an old icehouse and bring buckets of 
ice in to help cool the room she said 
when miss mitchell died on aug 16 at the age of 48 there were 
messages of condolence from around the world 
the city was certainly struck by it recalls celestine 
sibley a friend of the author who kept vigil at the hospital as a 
reporter for the atlanta constitution people felt a tremendous 
sense of personal loss 
public sentiment was strong against hugh dorsey gravitt the 
29yearold offduty taxi driver who was driving the car that 
struck miss mitchell gravitt was charged with murder but was 
convicted of involuntary manslaughter and served less than a year 
in prison 
gravitt now retired and living about 30 miles east of atlanta 
in covington refuses to discuss miss mitchells death 
i paid my debt 40 years ago but people just wont leave me 
alone he said in a brief telephone interview 
ms sibley who still works for the constitution as a columnist 
contends that gravitt was unfairly portrayed as a heartless killer 
he was the opposite griefstricken she says 
miss mitchell and her husband john marsh were on their way to 
see a movie the night she was injured they were crossing peachtree 
street to get to the theater when gravitt sped around a curve 
toward them marsh stepped forward and survived but his wife tried 
to make it back to the curb and was hit as gravitts car went into 
a long skid

marsh who had suffered from heart problems lived less than 
three years after his wife died because the marshes had no 
children the rights to gone with the wind went to stephens 
mitchell who died in 1983 
today all gone with the wind royalties belong to his two 
sons gene and joe although the rights to the book are in the 
hands of an administrative committee of three atlanta lawyers the 
committee which is selfappointing is to exist as long as there 
is business generated by gone with the wind 
margaret mitchell born in atlanta in 1900 took nearly 10 years 
to write her famous book the only one she ever published a former 
reporter for the atlanta journal sunday magazine she based her 
1037page novel on the civil war stories she heard as a child from 
those who lived through the war and reconstruction 
prior to gone with the wind peggy mitchell marsh was known 
to her friends as a petite funloving and often irreverent 
socialite who loved to give parties for journalists and atlantas 
literary crowd 
some of them knew she was working on a book keeping the 
manuscript in a growing pile of manila envelopes in the living room 
of her apartment but she refused to talk about it 
we all wondered what peggys book was going to be about 
recalls yolande gwin a retired society writer for the constitution 
the 1936 publication of the novel which won a pulitzer prize 
the next year placed miss mitchell and her husband a georgia 
power co executive squarely in an unwelcome spotlight 
i am sure scarlett ohara never struggled harder to get out of 
atlanta or suffered more during the siege of atlanta than i have 
suffered during the siege that has been on since publication day 
she wrote in july 1936 
it was her desire to keep her private life private that prompted 
miss mitchell to ask her brother to have their childhood home razed 
after he no longer had use for it the house was torn down in the 
1950s but its site is marked with a plaque placed by the georgia 
historical commission 
another gwtw landmark the loews grand theater where the film 
based on her book had its gala premiere in 1939 was gutted by 
fire in 1978 and has been replaced by an office tower its site 
also is marked with a plaque 
atlanta has a margaret mitchell court margaret mitchell drive 
margaret mitchell square and margaret mitchell elementary school 
plus a handful of library exhibits about her life and work 
but efforts to establish a mitchell museum in atlanta or nearby 
clayton county where her fictional plantation tara was set have 
so far been as unsuccessful as the confederate cause the latest 
a campaign to save the dump the apartment building where she 
wrote much of the book has been tied up in court since early last 
year 
the anniversary of miss mitchells death this year may go 
largely unnoticed but a celebration is in the works for december 
the 50th anniversary of the films debut 
meanwhile those who knew her are waiting curiously for the 
publication of a gone with the wind sequel something miss 
mitchell herself had opposed 
stephens mitchell opposed it too but shortly before his death 
he authorized attorneys to go ahead with the sequel knowing that a 
flood of unauthorized versions was likely as soon as the copyright 
on his sisters book expired in 2011 
a virginia author alexandra ripley was chosen to write the 
sequel which is due out next year 
in a 1988 interview ms ripley acknowledged that margaret 
mitchell fans are likely to view her efforts critically 
this one will never be mine she said its a foster 
mother kind of thing i am trying to prepare myself for a universal 
hatred of what im going to do

editors note in a town where the likes of thomas alva edison 
and guglielmo marconi once worked a town that helped perfect the 
radio and was home to new yorks first regularly licensed radio 
station the message is the medium just ask members of the antique 
radio club in schenectady ny one of about 30 such groups around 
the world 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the members of the antique radio club 
arent very impressed with a fancy computer during show and 
tell even if the palmsized gadget does decipher morse code at 
the speed of light 
but when someone starts passing around a set of stained 
yellowed photographs from 1915 depicting one of schenectadys first 
amateur radio stations a buzz of animated conversation fills the 
cramped basement where they are meeting 
this is after all something the 15 radio buffs most 
considerably advanced in age can understand tenderly thumbing the 
pictures carmin baker wrinkles his brow and smiles 
back then it was kind of a prestige thing to know hey the 
guy next door is a radio ham baker says we used to try to 
hang around him because we were interested in that kind of stuff 
the other silverhaired radio aficionados nod their heads 
theyve obviously come here to get together with the other guys 
and see what they got and talk as one member says 
the schenectady club affiliated with the rochesterbased 
antique wireless association is one of about 30 scattered around 
the world according to bruce kelley the curator of the 
associations museum all together there are about 10000 antique 
or historical radio collectors mostly in new york state and of 
those 300 are licensed by the federal communications commission to 
transmit on the rare radios kelley says 
however theres something about the schenectady organization 
that suggests its kind of special 
i built langmuirs personal hifi set for him blurts out 
robert thayer 73 referring to the nobel prizewinning chemist 
irving langmuir i put round knobs on the thing and he went 
crazy he couldnt have a round knob he wanted a pointer on there 
and he wanted to know where every one of the things was set he 
didnt care how loud it was but he wanted to know where that 
pointer was 
the memories come rushing back to these proud veterans of an era 
half a century ago when schenectady then home to the general 
electric and american locomotive companies unabashedly called 
itself the city that hauls and lights the world 
they talk excitedly about an intellectualism that once 
permeated the electric city located on the banks of the mohawk 
river 15 miles northwest of albany thomas alva edison started it 
all when he established his machine works in 1886 they say six 
years later the two nondescript brick buildings would become ge 
besides jobs and prosperity ge infused a muchneeded dose of 
selfrespect into a town that had too often been the butt of cruel 
jokes the thankfully forgotten song i cant spell 
schenectady didnt seem fair to a thriving metropolis that had a 
lively downtown huge department stores and a citizenry that 
included scientists such as guglielmo marconi 
schenectady was a nice place to live back in the 20s one of 
the nicest cities in the country boasted club chairman fay 
eckert well they had the erie canal here for one thing up to a 
point anyway which made it interesting and it was such a clean 
city 
but all this was before ge pulled out of the radio production 
business after world war ii quickly reducing its work force in 
schenectady from a wartime high of 45000 to 12000 many of the 
folks swapping memories at this reunion were among those thousands 
laid off 
twenty years later the locomotive company folded giving a coup 
de grace to what had been a long downward spiral 
now nobody comes to schenectady anymore grumbles francis 
emrich a private radio operator for 42 years 
bakers insistent voice rises above the din when i was a 
young man everybody got out of college went down to ge and got a 
job in the testing department 
thats why he like most of the others started working for ge 
in 1940 earning 35 cents an hour on an assembly line 
this was a time when schenectady breathed ate and drank radio 
technology emrich remembers the citys skyline bristled with the 
antennae of hm radio operators as a matter of fact emrich 
says ge used to give away tubes and other paraphernalia to hams 
until unscrupulous individuals began to steal the stuff 
emrichs a purist which means he wont use anything but genuine 
parts in his antique radio transmitters so many times hes had 
to search in some pretty odd places for spare parts 
it seems natural to these people that new yorks first regularly 
licensed radio station wgy which first broadcast in february 
1922 was started by ge in schenectady television also largely 
developed by ge soon followed in 1939 if necessity was the mother 
of invention then ge was the doctor who performed the delivery 
one thing about ge their minds were always working down there 
to improve things emrich says 
jack nelson considered the clubs patriarch because he reported 
to work for ge back in 1928 stands up to announce that the widow 
of a former friend and club supporter is having a garage sale lots 
of old radio equipment will be available 
the old radios the members avidly collect and lovingly restore 
are becoming scarce such as the 1924 westinghouse nelson keeps in 
his cluttered cellar or the 1930s atwater kent that a beaming ed 
farrell showed off in the back of his van at the clubs flea market 
before the meeting 
the thing is when we were kids a kid that was just mildly 
interested in radio could take a crystal and a pair of earphones 
and some wire and make it work says thayer his fingers wrapped 
around an oddlooking 1936 ge metal tube that he uses as a gavel 
now everything is so terrifically complicated that a kid has to 
be terrifically interested to get into it he cant just start with 
a simple thing and work up 
radios especially antique ones are fetching high prices also 
so much so that eckert now calls collecting a rich mans hobby 
he leaps at the chance to give an example a 25tube zenith 
stratosphere from 1939 a luxury radio that stands 5feet tall and 
probably cost 900 then was recently auctioned for 8000 in 
georgia 
eckerts own 33tube eh scott radio from 194041 which he 
calls the rolls royce of radios fetched a price of 350 back 
then and now is worth about 750 
but he admits its not in mint condition

editors note soviet violinist nina beilina who will be 
touring south america for a month starting aug 20 has spent a 
dozen frustrating years trying to get her career off the ground in 
the united states though the critics acclaim her artistry she has 
found that playing well is not always enough in a free enterprise 
system but finally she feels her star is on the rise 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
they sing of this town if you can make it 
there you can make it anywhere but if you are a soviet artist 
dancer mikhail baryshnikov notwithstanding it isnt easy 
nina beilina winner in three violin competitions and acclaimed 
for her playing in the soviet union gave a recital in december at 
lincoln center that was favorably received 
but shes been at it in new york for a dozen years and only now 
does she feel her career is in the ascendancy 
she has managed to make ends meet mainly by touring in europe 
south america and south africa she also teaches though previously 
with a sinking feeling that her career was going nowhere looking 
back she knows that she made mistakes 
in the soviet union artists are more protected a state agency 
books their performances keeps them at work 
but soviet artists newly arrived in america may find their 
reputations unknown then they have to find a booking agency and 
make decisions without family friends or trusted advisers add to 
that an unfamiliar language and culture shock 
it was just an incredible battle for a woman alone she 
says i came with only a library collected by me and my husband 
books and music scores i feel if i play well thats all it takes 
of course its not enough 
when despair threatened music saved her she practiced bach 
it was my refuge bach for me is like a priest to whom i go 
and talk just to touch the music is such happiness for me 
its through bach that her career is now building 
a woman who runs the free concerts at the cathedral of st 
john the divine heard me play she says she said i play bach a 
special way and i should make a festival from january through may 
last year from my students i created an orchestra i conducted my 
son played the double violin things with me in six concerts we 
had 15000 people 
i played all that bach wrote for violin it was my husbands 
wish in russia i did part of this with harpsichord and organ 
here i had a chance to do even more 
this year miss beilina was asked to organize four bach concerts 
at another church she was invited to establish a bach festival 
near rome june 815 taking 15 musicians with her after that she 
and her violinist son performed at a baroque festival in italy the 
15member group will tour in south america for a month starting 
aug 20 
in april she played the shostakovich violin sonata with soviet 
composer boris tischenko at new york university its without 
money she says but i feel very good you cannot live your 
life only for how much money you earn to play with a good pianist 
who understands shostakovich is very dear to me it could happen 
that he would write something for me 
in the soviet union after she married conductor israel 
chuydnovsky the authorities based him in leningrad and her in 
moscow they commuted to be together 
even when she was traveling pregnant with emile now a 
sophomore on scholarship at yale studying violin miss beilina 
recalls those days as her happiest 
fond of the idea of disneyland they nicknamed their son mickey 
before mickey was 2 his father died of cancer miss beilinas 
soviet concerts thereafter were in towns not cities her touring 
was restricted to south america and eastern europe in 1976 when 
mickey was 6 she applied successfully to emigrate 
in rome they shared an apartment with another family after a 
day doing laundry by hand in cold water because she had no money 
for hot she ran into a friend of her husbands he introduced her 
to a priest who moved mother and son into their own apartment and 
rerouted her from her intended destination canada to new york 
in new york she chose not to join an enclave of soviet emigres 
in queens she moved into a thennew apartment house for artists in 
manhattan with rent onethird of income where she still lives 
it was great luck to be accepted in this building she says 
the apartment was empty we had just books in big containers we 
slept on a rug when he was asleep i was crying when he was 
awake i tried to be cheerful

in russia i had a nanny for my son my brotherinlaw and 
friends helped me here i had 1000 things to put through my head 
miss beilinas first new york stop was a hotel a woman offered 
to be her amateur manager she took us to lunch and was kind to 
us 
the violinists south american manager arranged an audition for 
icm artists after which that big management company took her on 
its roster the amateur manager remained her personal 
representative she worked with me inside icm i didnt speak 
much english i didnt understand many things 
the new york times chief music critic harold schoenberg wrote 
of her january 1978 new york debut her playing leans more to the 
joseph szigeti kind of musical approach her playing is noble and 
even austere and she has more control over bow and finger than 
szigeti ever did 
the critic concluded his notice with a prediction a violinist 
of miss beilinas formidable powers will not be an unknown for 
long we will be encountering her many times in the future on the 
concert stage and with orchestra russias loss is our gain 
it hasnt happened 
i had only five concerts for the next year she says now 
i know that it takes at least two years to build up in russia 
they could book you for the next day 
the woman who befriended her told miss beilina that icms 
violinists including isaac stern all had israel connections 
she said i wouldnt be in a good position because i didnt 
emigrate to israel taking the womans advice she left icm and 
went to another agency now she considers it her biggest mistake 
that agency owned by europeans booked her in europe and south 
africa i had to go to south africa for the money i never had 
to be a waitress i never ask anybody to give me money im not 
materialistic i can live with little money 
but i didnt have any feeling that everything will be all 
right 
her playing suffered i got more and more upset it doesnt 
mean i go very low i found it very difficult to really be on top 
a comeback concert in 1984 was described in the new york 
times as coming after a period of what might be called 
professional instability and continued she should never have 
had to come back hers is the kind of solid violinistic talent that 
ought to be heard on a regular basis 
mstislov rostropovich recommended that another agency take her 
in three years it got her only five concerts i was living on 
reengagements italy germany south america south africa 
miami she says one of her first american engagements was 
playing beethoven in miami places where i played once i got 
reengagements one year after another last fall she switched to 
manager norman gladney 
in march between performances in germany and for the first time 
in 12 years miss beilina visited her native country she played 
music one evening in a former church now a recital hall without 
any publicity it was full i felt many people remember me and love 
me so that was very emotional also 
raising mickey alone wasnt always easy or smooth but now mother 
and son are friends and colleagues he was too fresh in school 
she says he was expelled from one school now i feel im a 
winner because he is in yale 
this is the first year i could do my work without having to 
cook for him every day before i was not able to play chamber 
music enough this year is productive and different i begin to 
play everything possible quartets and with piano 
the two bach festivals in churches here didnt pay but the one 
in italy does 
one thing is leading to another and miss beilina feels at last 
that her career is on the rise

editors note a controversial method of preventing beach 
erosion by using bags filled with concrete as barriers like 
underwater speed bumps is being tested in the great lakes critics 
of the system say it serves mainly to put money in the pocket of a 
businessman installing the barriers 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
to some waterfront property owners on 
the great lakes dick holmberg is a savior of shorelines 
to some government officials he is a nuisance making a lot of 
money at the expense of desperate homeowners willing to try his 
method of preventing beach erosion 
the state of michigan is footing the bill to find out whos 
right 
the battleground is at the base of a deteriorating 60foot bluff 
on lake michigan in this allegan county tourist town 
lakeshore drive a scenic stretch atop the dune has crumbled as 
the turbulent lake chews up the supporting bluff parts of the 
twolane road which is lined with summer homes have been closed 
or reduced to one lane 
what to do about the quartermile stretch of shrinking beach 
represents only a small part of the controversy confronting 
scientists government officials and communities as they seek ways 
to save the shorelines disappearing into our seas and the great 
lakes 
holmberg a selfdescribed geomorphologist without a degree 
claims he has found a solution 
he has found his believers in some satisfied customers and some 
state lawmakers who have authorized about 300000 from the state 
budget for a pilot project of his patented undercurrent 
stabilizer system 
holmberg who heads erosion control systems inc of whitehall 
has installed the system here and will put it next at east tawas 
on lake huron and possibly one other test site 
western michigan university will monitor the systems 
effectiveness 
there are those who believe dick holmbergs techniques are a 
godsend and then there are those who think hes a fake says 
state sen phil arthurhultz of whitehall who authorized the 
release of the funds but if theres a method out there that can 
protect our existing shoreline or expand it we are negligent if we 
are not employing it to the maximum 
if the study says it doesnt work then at worst it will have 
served as a form of consumer protection 
most coastal engineers believe shoreline erosion is a natural 
process and advocate tougher setback laws and the pumping of 
dredged sand to replenish beaches 
but holmberg blames governmental dredging of navigational inlets 
and construction of piers for erosion because they divert offshore 
the natural sandladen nearshore currents 
beach nourishment is a temporary costly solution and setback 
laws simply mean that were banning the shoreline just running 
from it holmberg says 
holmbergs devices consist of concreteinjected geotextile bags 
installed perpendicularly to the shoreline at regular intervals 
extending 150 feet into the lake 
he says they act as underwater speed bumps elevating and 
slowing the currents the suspended sand precipitates and is 
deposited on the shoreline within two to four years the bags are 
covered by sand the system costs 200 to 1000 per foot of 
shoreline 
traditional hard structures such as seawalls and rock revetments 
only reflect wave energy seaward and increase nearshore turbulence 
holmberg says the key he says is to work with the forces of 
nature not against them 
holmberg a burly 52yearold who installs every system himself 
has constructed hundreds for private property owners in the past 
decade 
he contends he has been tangled in bureaucratic red tape because 
the us army corps of engineers and state department of natural 
resources have conspired against him by restricting his permits 
its all about egos and power holmberg says ive taken a 
different path and even though they know my system works theyve 
chosen to ignore me 
moreover holmberg contends government officials dont want to 
preserve the shorelines 
they want to get rid of beaches because beaches are shallow 
water zones and you cant build a pier in a shallow water zone 
he says 
government officials scoff at those allegations 
mr holmberg is upset because he feels we are not doing enough 
to promote his product says martin jannereth of the dnrs land 
and water management division 
jannereth and other government officials say holmberg never has 
documented fully his systems effectiveness and that any apparent 
successes probably result from fluctuating lake levels 
holmberg however presents 10inchthick albums with dramatic 
beforeandafter photographs and says he has presented mounds of 
data only to be ignored 
a holmberg system was installed at the new buffalo summer home 
of thomas rehwaldt in 1986 a month before lake michigan reached 
its recordhigh levels 
even as the water got higher i began seeing beach almost 
immediately says rehwaldt who paid 21000 for the system 
today rehwaldt has 120 feet of beach outside his home before 
the system was installed part of his back yard had been swallowed 
by the lake 
the state department of transportation last year funded three 
holmberg installations near threatened roads in charlevoix in 
northeastern lower michigan so far they are pleased with the 
results dot engineer thomas coleman says 
at the saugatuck site homeowners approved the project in hopes 
their road and their property values will be restored 
but many coastal engineers say holmbergs techniques are nothing 
but variations on a groin a shoreattached structure that runs 
perpendicularly to the shoreline 
what gets me is that his techniques are nothing new theyre 
decades old says william wood director of the great lakes 
coastal research laboratory at purdue university he isnt doing 
anything dishonest but hes misrepresenting 
wood says he examined a system holmberg installed at ogden 
dunes ind in early 1985 and found that the stabilizers did lead 
to an expansion of homeowners beach but at the expense of their 
neighbors to the south 
where do you think the sand comes from wood asks 
holmberg denies that his structures adversely affect nearby 
beaches 
wood also says the bags holding the concrete have ripped and 
pieces of concrete have broken off creating an eyesore and 
potential hazard 
in florida holmberg was accused of violating dnr permits while 
installing a system at captiva island in 1979 officials there say 
though holmberg claims the project was successful a government 
report by a coastal engineering consulting firm was inconclusive 
some east coast states have banned the use of hard structures 
altogether and orrin h pilkey a duke university geology 
professor who heads a shoreline protection program says he was 
amazed taxpayers money was being used for a holmberg project 
all it is is hard stabilization with a snazzy name pilkey 
says

men says hays then brandon said he wanted robert hays at 
that time i was looking at things and had something i really wanted 
to do but the script was not quite right i read the script for 
fm and it was good and funny

an ak47 automatic rifle 
slung across his back luis smiles beneath his bushy black mustache 
at the salvadoran armys claim that the tide has been turned 
against antigovernment guerrillas 
the military analyzes the war mechanically said the 
guerrilla commander at his mountainside command post here 
because suchandsuch a detachment carried out 40 patrols last 
month and 45 patrols this month theyre supposedly winning the war 
but were not schematic we can slow down the military rhythm 
at times to concentrate on organization and political work so when 
the crucial moment arrives were ready 
at the age of 30 luis is a 10year veteran of the civil war 
the armed forces and the us government which foots the bills 
say professionalization and tactical reform of el salvadors 
military combined with the strategic bankruptcy of the 
insurgent army have provided a light at the end of the long 
tunnel of civil war 
the conflict has killed an estimated 70000 people most of them 
civilians the leftist farabundo marti national liberation front 
or fmln says it is fighting to do away with what it calls an 
oligarchic system that has enriched a few while leaving the 
vast majority of salvadorans destitute 
the rebels also say they want to end what they consider us 
domination of their country 
el salvadors military command and us embassy point out that 
fmln forces have not scored a resounding military success such as 
the overrunning of a brigade in two years 
even so combat continues daily in the countryside the rebels 
have also struck in the capital and they have acquired new weapons 
to counter the governments air power its single biggest tactical 
advantage 
by the governments count its forces suffered a 40 percent 
increase in casualties in the 12 months ending may 31 compared 
with the previous year casualties inflicted on rebel forces were 
up 47 percent according to the defense ministry in san salvador 
the government has 56000 men in three military branches and the 
militarized police forces it has 72 helicopters and 63 fixedwing 
aircraft a37 fighterbombers and o2 reconnaissance planes the 
military receives 85 million annually from the united states 
the fmln has about 7000 combatants down from 12000 early in 
the decade but stable since about 1986 according to us and 
salvadoran figures it relies heavily on popular armament 
mines mortars bombs and grenades devised of homemade explosives 
scrap metal nails tape twine and burlap 
the rebels reportedly get some arms from nicaragua and cuba and 
receive some money from communist governments in eastern europe 
they also receive money from socalled solidarity groups in the 
united states and western europe 
despite the disparity in forces and resources the army has been 
unable to defeat the rebels or erode their base of logistical 
support in up to a third of the country although the rebels have 
also been unable to expand 
everybody except the army knows where we are chuckled luis 
welcoming two foreign journalists who hiked up this mountain 60 
miles east of san salvador pausing to ask peasants the whereabouts 
of the boys as the rebels are known in the countryside 
five midlevel commanders of the southeastern front were on 
cerro del tigre tiger mountain for a twoday session on strategy 
achievements and shortcomings 
the first night saw rebel forces harass army positions in santa 
elena south of the mountain the second night they attacked 
government troops in jucuapa north of the heights 
if the militarys big edge is air support the guerrilla armys 
advantage appears to be in the morale and motiviation of its 
fighters 
the overwhelming majority of government footsoldiers are 
adolescent peasants who were drafted into service although the 
army has several elite battalions of seasoned troopers 
four us army colonels in a report last year on the salvadoran 
conflict quoted a senior us officer in el salvador as saying of 
government forces when the platoon leader aint there you aint 
got a platoon 
el salvador reveals an enemy whose commitment to victory is 
absolute and unbending the report said it characterized the 
fmln as tough competent highly motivated and added that it 
might be able to sustain its current strategy indefinitely 
during a recent weekend off from work an salvadoran air force 
helicopter pilot told how twice in recent months his craft had been 
seriously damaged by rebel ground fire us advisers and local 
officers blame sovietdesigned dragunov sniper rifles smuggled in 
to fmln forces over the past eight months 
the weapons have an effective range of 800 yards more than 
twice that of assault weapons such as the sovietdesigned ak47 and 
the us m16 the dragunov has obliged pilots to fly higher take 
more hits bomb less accurately and abandon more missions 
with air power less effective the rebels have resumed after a 
layoff of more than three years regular daytime attacks 
we are not going to win the war by killing guerrillas col 
rene ponce who heads el salvadors joint chiefs of staff said in 
a recent interview 
he and other top officers have been pursuing a hearts and 
minds campaign with permanent military presence in zones until 
now freely roamed by rebels and civic action programs of food 
and medicine distribution 
the approach appears to have had some success in the northeast 
but in other regions it is not uncommon to hear peasants refer to 
patrolling government soldiers as the enemy 
gen humberto larios the defense minister recently told 
foreign reporters the army killed more than 1000 guerrillas last 
year he said the rebels are taking heavier losses this year and if 
this pace can be sustained theyll loose closer to 2000 in 1989 
thousands more are being wounded or are deserting rebel ranks 
he said 
but he declined to predict when any allout victory would come 
you cant apply a formula to say when this war will end he 
said 
both the rebels and the new government of president alfredo 
cristiani a rightist say they want to negotiate but they cant 
agree on who should talk how to talk and what precisely to talk 
about 
we do what is necessary to keep the army tied down said 
luis surrounded by about 30 rebel fighters relaxing napping 
playing cards or cleaning their weapons 
meanwhile we create favorable conditions for the moment of 
truth if there are no negotiations well eventually win its 
just a question of how high the human and material cost will be

antique jewels patek phillipe 
watches tiffany lamps tudor chairs impressionist paintings 
middleclass argentines are selling family heirlooms accumulated 
during more affluent times in argentina for the money they need to 
get through these days of hyperinflation and economic collapse 
art dealers are flocking in from abroad to snap them up 
people are keener to sell for cash right now said pierre 
yves gabus a genevabased are appraiser and auctioneer people 
want dollars and they are selling what they have to get them 
gabus arrived three years ago since then he has set up shop in 
three other cities and watched as competitors flocked to join him 
in buenos aires 
fabian ayerza an assistant director of sothebys said at 
the beginning of this century argentines traveled often to europe 
and they used to buy quite good things 
now treasures carried across the atlantic in the staterooms of 
luxury ocean liners are returning home in jetliners 
theres no way to know the volume said alicia arteaga a 
reporter who covers art for the newspaper la nacion a lot of 
galleries come in buy 500000 worth of french chairs and leave 
every day ads appear in newspapers promising cash for antique 
furniture tapestries and rugs necklaces autographed manuscripts 
signed crystal and perhaps most of all paintings 
a patek philippe watch can fetch 7000 a sculpture by mariano 
benlliure y gil 330000 a set of dutch chairs from the 18th 
century 2500 each 
the painting two gypsies by joaquin sorolly y bastida sold 
for 140000 the painting the flight by charles edouard 
delort 100000 
buyers particularly want the impressionist and little master 
paintings of the mid and late 19th century that were bought by 
landowners flush from the sale of beef and grain from their 
sprawling estates 
the best private collections arent for sale the richest 
argentines are weathering what is for them the latest downtown in a 
decadeslong period of stagnation 
but many children and grandchildren of families whose fortunes 
have declined are looking on living room walls and in closets 
jewelry chests and basements for treasures 
not a few wind up disappointed 
they bring in an incomplete set of dishes or some old chairs 
and a table they bought 40 years ago thinking they are antiques 
said dealer franco levi they dont realize that to be an 
antique something needs to be at least 80 to 100 years old 
fernando sanchesini the director of christies in argentina 
said many argentines bought indiscriminately and lugged home fakes 
its disastrous for someone who has had a painting hanging on 
the wall for many years thinking it is worth a lot of money then 
we go in there and tell them it is worth very little sanchesini 
said 
the best pictures fetch prices from 50000 to 1 million 
dealers said some are sold outright most are sold on consignment 
a flemish painting that was bought here for 40000 sold for 
five times that amount in the united states said mauro 
herlitzka a collector 
argentines dont seem worried by the outflow of such valuable 
objects 
its not like argentina is losing its cultural heritage 
said mrs arteaga its stuff that was brought here and now its 
going back to where it came from

consider the chances of success for a play 
called other peoples money 
the authors last work folded on opening night 
the leading man left to make a film before rehearsals started 
his replacement backed out the day rehearsals were supposed to 
begin 
the third choice kevin conway was not exactly a boxoffice 
name 
the director gloria muzio was even less well known 
and the wall street crash of october 1987 made the subject 
matter the takeover of a small company by a ruthless tycoon 
seem outofdate to many experienced theater people 
none of the above stopped neophyte producers jeffrey ash and 
susan gallin from opening other peoples money last february at 
the minetta lane theater in six months the play by jerry sterner 
has slowly become one of offbroadways biggest hits with the 
soldout sign now going up for almost every performance 
the favorable wordofmouth has really done it for us says 
gallin whose only other producing effort in new york was burn 
this by lanford wilson two years ago 
such diverse theatergoers as theater critic john simon and 
business tycoons carl icahn and donald trump trump saw the play 
twice have praised other peoples money trump even offered 
to move the play to broadway a proposal declined by ash and gallin 
i think a successful play on broadway today has to almost 
approach being a musical ash says it has to have either a 
star or something out of the ordinary broadway has come to be a 
place only for muscials and extravaganzas and offbroadway has 
become a place to do good plays like driving miss daisy the 
cocktail hour or other peoples money 
producing a play offbroadway also is different from producing 
on broadway because the theaters are smaller so are the profit 
margins the line between a profitable and an unprofitable week can 
be narrow most new offbroadway shows need time to build audiences 
ash and gallin figured they would lose money during the early 
weeks of the run the time needed for favorable audience reaction 
to pay off their general manager told them to expect 12 weeks of 
losses they budgeted the show at 525000 including a reserve 
fund of 120000 raised to pay for a heavy advertising campaign 
i had seen too many mornings when the producers have to scurry 
to try and raise money to run an ad or a television spot ash 
says and then they wind up giving away all their producers 
points selling their soul to get that money its terrible 
ash knows something about selling shows although other 
peoples money is his first producing effort he has been in 
theatrical advertising for more than 20 years now director of 
theatrical accounts for grey entertainment and media ash was a 
pioneer in developing liveaction television ads for broadway plays 
and musicals 
ash worked on the advertising for sterners last venture the 
shortlived be happy for me despite its quick departure they 
became friends sterner knew that ash wanted to produce and brought 
him a copy of other peoples money his second play in early 
1987 
i read it and fell quite in love with it ash recalls 
the story concerns a barracudalike corporate raider who wants 
to take over a familyowned business that is the lifeblood of a 
small new england town the company hires an attractive female 
attorney to battle the takeover artist and their fights turn from 
the financial to the sexual 
the play had some readings on the west coast and with actor paul 
sorvino who was interested in playing the lead he didnt but the 
play was done at his american stage company in teaneck nj in 
the spring of 1987 
audience reaction was favorable and ash had lined up an 
investor to put up half the amount needed to bring the play to new 
york then the stock market crashed in october and the money 
evaporated 
gallin then entered the picture she became interested in the 
play after a good friend davina belling went after the movie 
rights 
i read a lot of plays and this one left me with something to 
think about gallin says and it was very entertaining i even 
gave it to people who werent in the theater to read and i got a 
wonderful reaction 
ash and gallin decided to produce the play together offbroadway 
and went looking for a director the two producers sought 
suggestions from their friends in the theater business mark lamos 
artistic director of the hartford stage company was on the top of 
everybodys list 
lamos had other commitments but a play reader at his theater 
recommended it lamos finally read other peoples money and 
loved it the play directed by gloria muzio was done at the 
hartford stage as part of its 198889 season 
that was a wonderful experience gallin says it was good 
for the play and for jerry who was able to do some rewriting and 
for gloria our director who had time to polish the production 
it was the hartford production with conway as a lastminute 
replacement as the new leading man that made it to new york 
the show opened with a miniscule advance and a favorable but not 
overwhelming review in the new york times which didnt deter the 
two producers 
we did a radio campaign sponsoring business reports on 
allnews radio stations in new york advertised in the wall street 
journal and sent letters to the ceos of many corporations and 
invited them to come ash says 
now the stretch limos are regular fixtures in front of the 
minetta lane theater as well as more ordinary theatergoers drawn 
by the favorable wordofmouth ash and gallin are now 
contemplating a national tour for the play probably with a star 
and also a london production 
its a play that stays with people somehow ash says they 
keep talking about it for days afterward and even two years after 
the big stock market crash its relevant you pick up the 
newspaper and you see this thing about warner brothers and time 
magazine and paramount the subject is still current

salaam bombay virgin vision inc english subtitles 
vhsbeta 7995 
 
salaam bombay is a heartrending look at the homeless street 
children of bombay india but its meanings and nuances transcend 
that exotic locale 
the film which won a number of international film awards in 
1988 is a rivetting portrayal of how 20thcentury societies 
including socalled civilized ones are devouring their young 
alternately selling them or selling them short 
producerdirector mira nair traveled the streets of bombay 
fascinated by the resilience of the thousands of children who 
survive by their wits in a squalid world of dirt drugs and 
prostitution 
she decided to tell their story not with actors but with 
children she gathered from those very backstreets 
salaam bombay is the story of 10yearold krishna 
abandoned first by his mother then by the traveling circus he 
joins he travels to bombay hoping to earn 500 rupees to take back 
to his mother 
krishna acquires street wisdom and a toughness that even leads 
to a murder but somehow almost miraculously he keeps a 
childlike empathy even as he is failing in his own hopes he 
befriends a desperate drug addict and comforts an abject 
16yearold sold by her own mother to a brothel 
the films producers decided to use proceeds to establish 
learning centers for the street children of bombay and delhi 
salaam bombay is not rated it has no objectionable 
language or sexual encounters but the themes of street life are 
nonetheless unvarnished 
it is a truly exceptional film

crusoe virgin vision vhsbeta 8995 rated pg13 
 
crusoe based on the tale of a shipwreck on a tropical 
island is a lush and aesthectically pleasing movie and as ripe 
with moral dilemmas as the burdened coconut trees swaying on the 
beach 
in crusoe values come crashing down and savagely splinter 
the beliefs of the movies star aidan quinn 
quinn plays a greedy young 19thcentury slave trader who tempts 
fate by taking one final and risky expedition to round up more 
blacks from africa but his ship becomes ensnared in a vicious 
autumn storm and all aboard perish except for quinn who winds up 
sprawled on a desolate beach 
crusoe learns to endure the solitude and fashions a comfortable 
shelter for himself on the picturesque island 
before long his isolation is interrupted by visiting natives he 
rescues one from a human sacrifice and decides keep him as a slave 
but the native later escapes and is killed 
in a provocative twist crusoe becomes the hunted and is trapped 
by another islander but the two men reach an accord and build 
something of a friendship 
the films ending is the final test of crusoes new respect for 
the man he once wanted to enslave 
director caleb deschanel so effectively captures the panoramic 
beauty of the island setting with its creamy white sand beaches 
dense verdant forests and crystal blue tide pools one can almost 
taste the salt spray in the breeze 
there also is very little dialogue but the engrossing visuals 
and the moral struggles make for compelling viewing

good evening warner bros marshall crenshaw 
 
marshall crenshaw has spent a meandering solo career trying to 
live up to the promise of his sparkling 1982 debut hes finally 
done it on good evening largely because hes changed many of 
the elements that made him a success in the first place 
that debut was a pristine piece of poprock hearkening back to 
the days of buddy holly but the strippeddown sound eventually 
became a trap 
good evening has crenshaw significantly toughening and 
filling out his sound with the help of slide and pedal steel 
guitarists such as david lindley sonny landreth and james burton 
john mellencamp drummer kenny aronoff completes the rock n roll 
kick 
its welcome power behind a guy who rightly or wrongly had 
developed a reputation as a rock n roll wimp mostly because of 
his sweet voice and sweet songs 
crenshaw also recognizes his limitations as a writer for the 
first time hes always been able to create a couple of catchy 
tunes per record but is unable to sustain interest through a full 
album 
here he interprets songs by richard thompson john hiatt bobby 
fuller and the isley brothers he even seeks cowriting help on 
some of his own songs the welcome diversity of voices make his own 
contributions particularly she hates to go home sound that 
much better 
the clicheridden radio girl is really the only mistake on 
this 10song album the thompsonwritten valerie and good 
hearts are particularly appealing 
it took some time probably too much for crenshaw to find 
whats right for him but the rewards here are plentiful

when peter falk filmed scenes for his new 
movie cookie at sing sing it marked a sentimental return 
not that he was ever a guest at the legendary slammer he grew 
up in ossining ny 
yeah i remember sing sing he reflected as a kid i used 
to go into the prison because the towns basketball team played the 
prisoners a lot of the kids i went to school with their fathers 
were guards there 
whenever you mentioned to people that you came from ossining 
they always had the same question do the lights go out when they 
electrocute somebody of course the lights never dimmed you were 
not aware of the prison as an ominous thing 
the major memory about sing sing had to do with the one big 
escape when i was in high school three guys broke out and went 
down to the river by the railroad station and got a hold of a boat 
one local cop was shot on the way down and one of the convicts was 
shot they actually rowed across the hudson and they were picked 
up on the palisades across the way that was a big thing 
in the new warner bros release cookie falk is mobster 
dino capino who is about to be sprung after 13 years in sing sing 
his teenage daughter played with amazing skill by english actress 
emily lloyd comes to visit him she is resentful since he hasnt 
married her mother dianne wiest he already has a wife brenda 
vaccaro as you might guess cookie is not the godfather 
iii 
after his long service as tvs slovenly gumshoe columbo falk 
is on the other side of the law thats were he started in movies 
it was nice being a mob guy again he remarked it was 
nice looking good too great suits they gave me did i look good 
i thought i did however he would brook no criticism of his 
columbo raincoat which is still in action after 29 years 
you know my first picture was murder inc in 1960 i made a 
little splash in that he said i played abie reles who was 
part of that jewish mob that operated out of brooklyn at that time 
they were the first ones who hired themselves out to kill people 
they were all quite crazy abie was probably the craziest 
those mob guys when they saw that picture they went for it 
they liked me they came around and i spent some time with them i 
had a real interest in those guys i think everybody does 
i remember going around with some cops in new york they were 
mostly involved in drug cases but they also had some wire taps of 
mob guys i wanna tell ya if i had those tapes here and could play 
em for ya youd roll on the floor there are no funnier 
conversations i ever heard in my life 
peter falk may sound like a street guy but he has a bachelors 
degree in political science from the new school of social research 
in new york he was studying for his masters at the university of 
syracuse when he dropped out to try acting 
when i started out i was 2526 years old in offbroadway in 
new york he said like most actors i knew at that time we all 
wanted the same thing to be in the actors studio we thought that 
was heaven on earth 
i never thought about being in movies i never thought about 
being in television i just wanted to be a stage actor i remember 
this agent ive told the story before the guy said to me you 
know you wont be able to do tv or movies i dont know why but 
that didnt make any difference to me because i had never 
considered doing tv or movies 
i asked what he was talking about and he said your glass 
eye falk lost his eye when he was 3 he won an academy 
nomination for his supporting performance in murder inc and 
he has been working in films and television ever since 
falk won three emmy awards for his portrayal of lt columbo 
during its 19711977 run on nbc last season abc installed 
columbo as part of its abc mystery movie much to falks 
delight the show has been renewed for 198990 and he hopes to 
play the role for years to come

new truths hang within the old walls of 
palazzo reale as the theory goes they are such stuff as dreams 
are made on 
inside the 18thcentury royal palace are the works of 300 
artists poets and philosophers who sought a different truth beyond 
the boundaries of reason 
the show is the surrealists and it is the biggest 
exhibition of the movement andre breton once described as an 
attempt to resolve the previously contradictory conditions of 
dream and reality 
breton was the french poet who helped guide and first define the 
movement in the early 1920s he was a close friend of arturo 
schwarz the curator and driving force of the milan show that 
presents surrealisms history in almost 2000 works of art 
documents and publications 
without false modesty it is the most important exhibition ever 
presented since the beginning of surrealism schwarz said 
inside the palace hang the hallucinations of artists such as max 
ernst yves tanguy and salvador dali fantastic perspectives in 
absurd and chaotic dreamscapes seemingly incompatible objects 
painted together in a context alien to both of them with a fanciful 
but meticulous realism as the french poet comte de lautreamont put 
it beautiful as the chance encounter of a sewing machine and an 
umbrella on an operating table 
this side of surrealism transforms isolated anatomical parts 
into grotesque creatures it captures weird and wonderous objects 
on an ethereal plain 
surrealism rests upon belief in the higher reality of specific 
forms of associations previously neglected in the omnipotence of 
dreams and in the disinterested play of thought wrote breton 
few of the original surrealists who exchanged their 
revolutionary ideas and rage against the social order in paris 
cafes in the 20s are still alive 
salvador dali died jan 23 his images of watery timepieces 
melting flesh and disfigured appendages became symbols of 
irrational expression and insolence for the group of writers 
painters and philosophers who had set out to explode the social 
order they included the artists tanguy arp miro magritte and 
ernst filmmaker luis bunuel and writers breton and paul eluard 
 
jean hans arp joan miro and andre masson emphasize the 
abstract nature of surrealism although their forms sometimes grow 
into animate figurative and representational patterns 
with these strange and hypnotic images schwarz presents the 
poets essayists and philosophers whose words complement the 
painters baffling visions but also give the movement direction and 
perspective 
in the show i wanted to dispel two common falsehoods the 
first is that surrealism is a movement confined to painting it 
started as a literary political and philosophical movement he 
said 
surrealism was mainly a movement of poets and writers with a 
very strong political commitment said schwarz it was one that 
increasingly became preoccupied with communism although the 
communist party would have none of it 
the other myth is that surrealism is associated with dali and 
thats all he was the least important of the surrealists said 
schwarz 
no two surrealists are alike every single surrealist artist 
has his own voice the only thing that unites them is the common 
endeavor to express the deepest impulses of ones pysche 
each artist expresses himself to the best of his ability 
trying to put on canvas the phantoms dreams and desires of his 
conscious and unconscious 
the idea for the show began when deputy mayor luigi corbani 
called schwarz on feb 14 and asked him if he could put together a 
show on surrealism that would open june 7 a day later schwarz 
agreed on one condition 
this was he said that i be given a blank check to do 
whatever i wanted 
time was short and schwarz wanted to exhibit all the main trends 
and the key surrealists he wanted to bring together a collection 
never before achieved because of budgetary and geographical 
constraints 
i worked from four in the morning until midnight every day for 
four months said schwarz 
the result is the show of 945 original works of art and 970 
documents first editions letters and extremely rare periodicals 
he also published a detailed 669page catalog 
the show is never the one that its curator would like it to 
be complained schwarz lamenting his inability to acquire 
certain works still he says the exhibit includes at least 30 to 
40 masterpieces that are essential to a survey of surrealism 
schwarz also presents the works of the precursors to surrealism 
such as hieronymus bosch who represent what he calls the black 
romantic trend that has always existed in art he also includes 
works from companions of the street giorgio de chirico 
marcel duchamp and other artists 
surrealism says schwarz gave the artist the freedom to 
completely express himself his inner self his convictions 
that is why so many painters were attracted to surrealism 
because it offered them a complete philosophy of life not only a 
cooking recipe such as cubism or impressionism said schwarz 
surrealism had a major influence on the movements that followed 
it such as abstract expressionism but schwarz says it made one 
overriding contribution 
it liberated the artists from the shackles of moral and 
aesthetic canons 
the exhibition closes sept 10

twentytwo years after they began 14 years 
after they broke off and 20 years after they played at woodstock 
ten years after is back together 
a chrysalis album about time will be released in august 
15 years after their last one and a sevenweek fall us tour is 
planned the quartet one of the major bands to emerge from the 
1960s blues revival in england known for its fast and furious 
blend of blues and mediumheavy rock has not mellowed out 
guitaristvocalist alvin lee has been performing while bassist 
leo lyons keyboardist chick churchill and drummer rick lee have 
stayed in music producing engineering and managing 
in an interview with alvin lee and lyons lee said that the band 
didnt so much split up as wind down wed had some degree of 
success and wed all got nice houses and families there was a bit 
of pressure to stay at home 
he said that before ten years after split critics said i was 
a fast tasteless guitar player that was bothering me a bit i 
shouldnt have let it now i realize 
so he put together the sevenpiece in flight critics said it 
was wonderful and i was playing better than ever i missed the roar 
of the crowd and the loudness after a while that band wasnt 
capable of playing heavy rock i went back to playing from my blues 
and rock roots he formed ten years later for a year then alvin 
lee and company which played some ten years after favorites 
when we played together last summer suddenly it sounded like 
ten years after right from the first note it was obvious ten 
years after had its own sound lee said 
reception at the festivals was so enthusiastic lyons said that 
the four decided to stay together lee and lyons each working with 
other people wrote 40 songs the band recorded 15 unable to 
decide on 10 they put 11 on about time 
in july ten years after played before 80000 in east berlin 
asked about woodstock which took place 20 years ago on a farm 
in bethel ny on aug 15 16 and 17 lyons says its all a 
bit hazy now to be honest 
still memories come back 
we were set to go on and a thunderstorm appeared lee said 
nobody could play for two or three hours sparks were flying on 
the stage i thought it outdid the music by far gods light show 
in a way it was fortunate i went for a walk around the lake 
and joined in with the audience nobody knew i was one of the 
musicians half a million people cant all run under trees they 
sat there and started singing people were playing on mud slides 
it was a wonderful thing to see that happening everybody was 
making the best out of the ridiculous sitation i think it brought 
the best out of everybody 
people were offering food and drink it was very idealistic 
very nice i think had it not been for the storm probably i would 
never have seen much 
one of the reasons i went out was because in the backstage 
area there wasnt a single cigarette i came back with 10 marajuana 
cigarettes no regular cigarettes 
lyons said they said the food backstage was spiked with acid 
whether it was true or not it dims the appetite the drinks were 
supposed to be dodgy in those days you never used to drink from an 
open can anyhow 
neither can remember what ten years after played except for 
im going home the highenergy rocker used in the 
woodstock movie and they think the jazzy i cant keep from 
crying sometimes and love like a man 
i remember we did good morning little schoolgirl lyons 
said because the tuning went out because of atmospheric 
conditions we had to stop the song apologize and retune we did 
going home as an encore 
we were the first on after the storm lee recalled 
everybody was worried sparks were still flying off the stage and 
it was very wet somebody had to do it think how many of our 
records would have sold if wed been electrocuted 
it was definitely the movie that made woodstock the memorable 
thing it was lee said toronto was probably as good a festival 
as woodstock it got forgotten 
we carried on in 3000 to 5000seat halls a year later the 
movie came out and were into 20000 seaters 
the night before their woodstock appearance ten years after was 
in st louis at a jazz festival before a primarily black audience 
nina simone went on lyons said four white hippies went 
on afterwards when we walked on stage an uproar was starting it 
was frightening but we played a bit of jazz and blues and we were 
ok then 
lee sais that in one way woodstock was a statement against 
racial prejudice it was even more about the peace movement and 
the vietnam war we thought the peace movement was very real and a 
good thing to be doing woodstock tended to make it into a 
fashionable thing the fashion grew old and it was no longer cool 
to be a hippie 
lyons added woodstock was antiestablishment a peace and 
love thing antiviolence it was for tolerance let people do what 
they want help one another i think it had a lot of longterm 
benefits 
but they didnt know what woodstock symbolized before they got 
there lee said it was just another line on the sheet 
they flew from st louis to new york and drove until they came 
to blocked roads 
they took us in an army helicopter lee said i was 
hanging out on a safety strap over all the audience it was a 
mindblowing experience

the floating world cynthia kadohatas first 
novel is best read on a window seat of a greyhound bus names and 
places speed by friendships form quickly departures come with 
little warning 
through olivia the books young narrator kadohata evokes a 
life of gas stations and motels wrecked cars and parttime jobs a 
world where a marriage of 10 years is treated with disbelief and 
some disdain where no place is like home 
sometimes when im on a greyhound bus i think this is where i 
belong the author explained ive never spent a year somewhere 
and said this is it i havent really got off that bus but id 
like to 
as a child kadohata was shocked to learn that her classmates 
had assigned bedtimes there were few rules in her house little 
routine at all 
she was born in chicago but soon lived in arkansas and georgia 
by the time she was 9 her parents were divorced and she had 
returned to chicago with her mother sister and brother kadohata 
now lives in manhattan but feels restless suspicious of setting 
down roots 
the floating world viking 1795 is not autobiographical 
kadohata insists despite the books story of olivias experiences 
as she moves across the country during the 1950s and 60s what 
the floating world does capture however is the feelings 
brought on by constant upheaval 
even today i sometimes feel i dont know where i belong the 
author said too bad a lot of times i would like having a 
feeling of belonging but i like traveling too 
she writes from the perspective of a secondgeneration 
japaneseamerican whose father was interned in prison camp during 
world war ii and who learned quickly how fragile the allegiances 
of family and neighborhood could be 
it was really upsetting she said of her fathers 
experience the thing is that i know it will never happen to me 
yet because it happened to my father im less sure of my place in 
the world 
kadohata first wanted to be a journalist but a few years after 
graduating from college she began writing short stories shes been 
published in the new yorker grand street and the pennsylvania 
review 
with fiction you can change the facts to reveal a larger 
truth thats the root of fiction thats the problem i have with 
nonfiction i would be so tempted to tell a lie because it would 
tell the story better thats what makes nonfiction so great too 
all the tension 
at the start of world war ii when japan was the united states 
bitter enemy olivias grandparents are forced to give their 
children american names such as roger lily laura ann the 
tradition is passed on to olivia and her siblings ben walker and 
peter 
when i read on the cover of time magazine are the japanese 
being unfair i kind of think people are going to be mad at me 
kadohata said 
i do have that sort of identification its hard because i 
look japanese whereas somebody whose parents came over from italy 
no one would think of ascociating him that closely with italy 
kadohatas infuences however are profoundly american she 
draws on the southern writer william faulkners feelings of 
restlessness and chaos and uses the spare language of raymond 
carver and bobbie ann mason 
and like faulkner she is fascinated with the blurring of myth 
and reality as olivia rides through oklahoma a hitchhiker appears 
and quickly vanishes kadohata also writes of an encounter between 
olivia and a friend of her stepfathers 
see my house he said its an illusion its not really 
there 
i looked at the house surrounded by dark and trees and below 
an ornageringed moon it did not seem quite real thats what i 
thought he meant 
the author explained i wanted some things to be fantastical 
thats a lot like me i daydream a lot its kind of like the 
saying about magic its true if you believe it and its not true 
if you dont believe it 
after olivia the narrator of the floating world graduates 
from high school she moves to california which had a mythic hold 
on kadohata and many americans as the symbol of a better life 
when we first moved there she recalled we were in a 
truck with my mothers boyfriend and we had driven across country 
i looked at all these little houses and i was just heartbroken it 
wasnt what i expected i expected to think it was a promised 
land 
she first called the book seven moons wanting to use the 
phases of the moon to mark the passage of time 
i was going to put the moon in all over maybe its just 
continuity i just wanted to describe the moon she said 
thats why i love traveling taking the bus i like to look at 
the landscape

flowers are placed daily on his grave 
letters come in constantly from around the world 
promising country music singer keith whitley died of an 
accidental alcohol overdose in may but he lives on in the memories 
of his fans and the legacy of his music 
an album recorded just a month before he died i wonder do you 
think of me was released in july by bmg musicrca records the 
first single release from the album carries the same name now made 
ironic by his death he was 33 when he was found dead at his 
suburban nashville home on may 9 
after it the album was cut he felt it was his best work 
said joe galante senior vice president and general manager of rca 
records in nashville 
others agree that the handsome bearded whitley was becoming a 
major force in country music until his personal demons felled his 
considerable talent 
he was beginning a super career said jack mcfadden his 
manager he was rolling he had three no 1 records and had just 
finished a great album he was drawing large crowds and having 
standing room only crowds in most of the clubs he played there 
were standing ovations every show 
he was a great entertainer and a great kid 
his hit record at the time of his death im no stranger to 
the rain continues to be one of the mostplayed music videos on 
country music television country musics version of mtv and vh1 
he was a rare artist said garth fundis his record 
producer when he sang songs about things close to him it was 
always soulful and from the heart very few singers can equal what 
he did in the music he recorded 
since whitleys death fans have reacted by sending literally 
hundreds of letters and floral tributes 
mcfadden visited the grave site a few weeks after the burial and 
was touched by the outpouring 
there were large crowds and flowers everywhere people have 
come from texas michigan indiana iowa the carolinas all 
over he said 
were still getting mail stacks of mail there has been mail 
and phone calls from england and even africa 
whitley a native of sandy hook ky sang wrenching tunes about 
pain and joy such as dont close your eyes and when you say 
nothing at all he is a posthumous candidate as country musics 
male vocalist of the year 
after whitley died a fund in his name was created at vanderbilt 
medical centers institute for treatment of addiction mcfadden 
said more than 4000 was contributed to the fund in the first few 
weeks following the death 
its coming in every day he said they told me at 
vanderbilt that they have received calls from people outside 
nashville like hollywood celebrities this has affected them 
mcfadden said he was aware that the sandyhaired whitley had a 
drinking problem but the singer hid it well and few knew about it 
whitley had said publicly that he battled alcoholism in his younger 
years 
according to the coroner his blood alcohol content was 
equivalent to 20 oneounce shots of 100proof whiskey he was well 
beyond the lethal level 030 
he was controlling it for the most part mcfadden said 
every once in a while hed slip hed had the problem for many 
years starting in his teens he did quit for six months then 
started nipping and quit again 
i noticed an attitude change in the last three or four months 
he was normally a giving warm loving person but he got a little 
ragged nervous and uptight 
some members of whitleys band have taken jobs with other 
country singers such as clint black though mcfadden said a 
couple of the guys are so overcome they just dont feel like 
working for a while 
his 140 concert appearances which were scheduled as far ahead 
as next january have been canceled or assumed by others 
whitleys wife grand ole opry star lorrie morgan has resumed 
her career which is on the upswing her record dear me was a 
top 10 country hit in july 
shes grabbed hold of herself and taken charge and is working 
and taking care of her family mcfadden said the couple known 
affectionately as mr and mrs country music had two children 
a 2yearold son and an 8yearold daughter 
she grieves mcfadden said when shes not busy she has a 
rough time 
the two recorded duets together but those have not been released

over its 100year existence wendy and 
john wheats victorian house has undergone many renovations not 
all of them fortunate 
the worst thing done to the house was to put asbestos shingles 
up theyre known as the skin disease of house renovation says 
mrs wheat though the wheats hated the shingles they liked the 
lines interior arrangement and location of the fourbedroom house 
in rowayton when they bought it four years ago 
today what was once an unprepossessing home is now a charming 
restored victorian decorated with a pleasing mix of american 
country victorian and contemporary furnishings 
the wheats have given the house a new lease on life with a 
structural and decorative facelift which has included new exterior 
siding and insulation the addition of architectural elements and 
new paint and wallpaper 
substituting better quality and more architecturally interesting 
doors and windows has made a subtle but substantial difference in 
the appearance of their home the change has brought out the 
original character of the victorian and provided a greater sense of 
quality for a relatively small outlay 
the couple spent about 60000 on the renovation which they 
financed through a home equity loan and an inheritance 
the largest and most costly job involved removing the shingles 
and putting up new clapboard siding with victorian fish scale 
shingles in the peaks the resurfacing and installation of 
appropriate architectural trim has exposed the good lines of the 
original house the most spectacular interior improvement has been 
redoing the master bedroom bath and dressing area 
the wheats hired a professional designer to help them we knew 
it would be a little more expensive to use a decorator but we felt 
that we would end up with a better job and that it would add more 
value to the house says mrs wheat a recreational therapist who 
works with seniors her husband works in marketing for a bank 
they chose westport decorator beverly ellsley whose work they 
had seen and liked in showhouses and magazines 
after only 10 minutes she pointed out every single thing that 
bothered me about the house and all her suggestions were just 
right as a professional she was able to cut corners in some 
places and she did come in at budget she did not impose her own 
taste says mrs wheat 
the home is furnished with an eclectic mix of american country 
and antique furniture english scrubbed pine a few victorian 
pieces and a contemporary sofa much of the places charm comes 
from mementos and artwork which mean a great deal to them 
paintings by wheats father a profesional artist coexist 
comfortably with his own artworks in wood as well as crafts the 
couple has collected during travels in mexico and greece 
the wheats exercised frugality by selecting furnishings 
judiciously and by doing some of the work themselves for example 
they splurged on builtin custom cabinetry in the master bedroom 
but pickled the white pine cabinetry themselves saving about 
1500 to 2000 
the bed in the eclectic victoriancontemporary country room is 
covered in several layers of expensive sheets by ralph lauren but 
mrs wheat bought some of the sheets in an outlet shop she used 
material from a flat kingsized sheet that cost about 100 to sew a 
border on a plain white sheet leftover fabric from that sheet 
eventually will be used to cover throw pillows lace curtains at 
the windows in the living room are inexpensive panels purchased for 
about 4 each in a craft supplies outlet 
the bedroomdressing area was remodeled to provide more storage 
and better light three unmatched windows were replaced with two on 
each side of the room that match and a new halfround window 
framing a sunburst design set dramatically high above the bed at 
the ceiling line 
a kingsized bed is now placed against the pine bookshelf wall 
with builtin nightstands opposite the bed a wall of builtin 
cabinetry has mirrored doors above and drawers below normally 
inaccessible high open shelves in both units are used for 
decorative storage 
the couple retiled the bathroom with a blue and white 
checkerboard floor and installed a new shower 
now that the major work is done the wheats say they are 
content some day they hope to redo the deck as a victorian porch 
add a second screened porch and possibly do over the kitchen 
a dream is to put in a small home gym say the couple who have 
been married 13 years but meanwhile its nice to look around 
and be really satisfied with what we see says mrs wheat

you dont need a decorating authority to tell you that a room 
with whitewashed walls unpolished terra cotta floors blue and 
white tiles and an antique walnut armoire is a country french style 
room 
this rustic traditional style is one of the most popular looks 
currently consequently youll find many reproductions in the 
marketplace to help you achieve it says pierre moulin coauthor 
of pierre deuxs french country 
a principal of pierre deux the new york antiques firm that 
helped popularize the style moulin says the french country look is 
more an overall feeling than any single specific group of 
furnishings 
however he says some of these elements in antiques or 
reproductions help to create a french country room 
an armoire often as tall as 10 feet was often part of a 
brides dowry and was passed down from one generation to another 
today armoires are used to store a great variety of belongings 
such as clothing linens home entertainment equipment dinnerware 
and barware armoires look great in virtually any room especially 
the living area dining room and bedroom 
french armoires are usually walnut or cherry and often feature 
carvings of flowers wheat or vine leaves some of the prettiest 
armoires however have painted finishes 
dining chairs in country french rooms are rustic and simple 
rush seats are typical but cane and ladder backs are also used 
appropriate french country beds include canopy beds beds with 
panel headboards and day beds a white mesh drapedmetal framed bed 
with a canopy frame that comes to a center point is a romantic 
treatment most country bedrooms were quite simple with a minimum 
of possessions and accessories on display 
country french fabrics emphasize natural fibers good choices 
include vividly colored provencal prints plaids and tapestries and 
toile de jouy scenes in white with black red green or blue can be 
used both as upholstery and to line walls 
if youre stuck for a color scheme or fabric choice look at the 
provincial paintings of cezanne and van gogh to get some ideas 
here are some additional decorating suggestions from michael 
delgaudio fashion director of henredon furniture 
paint the walls white a stucco finish is ideal because it 
provides a rustic feeling 
terra cotta tile bare wood planking or sisal matting are all 
appropriate choices for floors if you like the look of tile but 
dont want to install it try painting the floor with a blue and 
white trompe loeil tile pattern 
arrange furniture symmetrically and use pairs of furniture and 
accessories to create a strong feeling of balance for example 
place the same model of console table or chairs at either side of a 
door or sofa place two candlesticks on a mantel 
emphasize accessories such as pewter glazed and unglazed 
ceramic pieces copper pots straw baskets dried flowers for 
fresh flowers favor potted geraniums and bunches of daisies and 
hang pictures a little higher than normal 
arrange the interior of armoires attractively so you can leave 
them open line them with french fabric as housewives did in 
provence keep window treatments simple lace panels are 
appropriate

for people who dont want to be pinned down to a single style 
american country is one of the best decorating choices 
since it is an adaptation of rural designs to suit contemporary 
needs and not from a single period or place american country is 
well adapted to todays needs says designer raymond waites 
waites has written several books on american country style and 
has also designed reproduction collections of furniture fabrics 
wall coverings and accessories he says that the overriding point 
of american country is its spirit you can mix periods and styles 
as long as the room maintains its casual quality 
for example he says its easily possible to put together a room 
that includes shaker reproductions primitive painted pieces and 
victorian wicker when decorating american country style look for 
rustic furniture in native american woods such as walnut chestnut 
maple and pine or painted pieces 
stanley hura is a designer who has created many american country 
rooms settings in which to display the museum of american folk art 
reproduction collection by lane he offers these tips to a 
successful american country room 
keep backgrounds simple and uncluttered choose clear colors and 
select accessories that are not too fussy you can soften the 
feeling of the contemporary american country room with lace and 
floral fabrics or you can make the room more masculine with 
cowhide and american indian motifs he says 
hura says that there are several ways to go with traditional 
american country rooms first decide whether you want to create a 
formal or a rustic setting 
if its formal a style that suggests smalltown america of the 
mid19th century choose victorian style furniture such as 
adaptations of english and french pieces use area rugs such as an 
oriental or a needlepoint rug on the floors you can choose simple 
window treatments or more elaborate layered effects that combine a 
heavier fabric with a sheer undercurtain wallpaper the walls 
making use of borders to take the place of architectural detailing 
that may be lacking 
a more primitive and rustic room is the result when you select 
twig furniture rustic pine pieces or the newly popular arts and 
crafts style place rag rugs or hooked rugs on the floors walls 
can be simply whitewashed or stencilled rough textured fabrics of 
homespun cotton and linen are appropriate and simple country 
pottery and tin spatterware are suitable baskets of dried flowers 
flowering potted plants and original or reproductions of primitive 
paintings are also in character 
another variant of the american country look incorporates motifs 
from the american west such as california mission furniture 
ornate yet roughhewn spanish or mexican pieces or germanamerican 
biedermaier pieces the color scheme comes from indians blankets 
and the earth tones of the american west 
an advantage in furnishing american country style is that 
reproductions from virtually all the earlier periods are now 
available besides colonial and federal style furniture youll 
find reproductions of country pieces from the 19th century as well 
as copies of mission and arts and crafts style furniture

american homeowners spent an average of 6600 on remodeling 
renovation or repair over the past five years according to a 
survey by the better homes and gardens consumer panel 
the survey also found that most considered family a key reason 
for home ownership but onequarter of those asked felt the home 
was important as an investment and for financial security 
part of the satisfaction of home ownership says allen 
sabbag president of better homes and gardens real estate service 
stems from the deep feelings americans hold toward their home as 
a focal point for the family 
survey results show that for nearly twothirds of the panel a 
homes primary importance is to serve as a place to protect and 
gather the family 
thirtyeight percent of the respondents spent between 2500 and 
10000 for remodeling and renovating in the fiveyear period with 
17 percent spending more than 10000

there may not be more phony antiques than there used to be but 
americans are certainly more aware of them says samuel pennington 
editor of the maine antique digest 
however consumers can protect themselves according to 
pennington and myrna kaye an authority on antique american 
furniture 
keep an open mind and bring a bright light when you go shopping 
for antique furniture says kaye author of fake fraud or 
genuine identifying authentic american antique furniture 
although a good deal of the antique american furniture on the 
market is not as described in her opinion a questioning attitude 
and careful examination can help one to spot fakes 
kaye says that next to a questioning attitude a strong light is 
the most useful aid in identifying furniture that may be posing as 
something it is not she carries a 500watt portable lamp and uses 
it whenever the light is not adequate for complete scrutiny of a 
piece a good flashlight can achieve the same results 
other tools kaye takes along on antique furniturehunting jaunts 
include a yardstick and calipers to measure shrinkage 
since old wood furniture invariably shows signs of shrinkage 
taking measurements in several places helps you spot shrinkage and 
hence confirm that a piece is old calipers can be used to take 
the dimensions of the round turned parts of wood furniture 
she also carries tweezers and a needle the needle is to probe 
what look like wormholes a drill rather than worms made any hole 
that is deeper than oneeighth of an inch the tweezers are useful 
in extracting splinters which are a common hazard when running your 
bare hands over a piece of wood furniture to see if it has the same 
degree of roughness all over 
the types of fakes she says are most common include married 
pieces consisting of parts of different pieces that have been put 
together assembled sets in which one or more elements are new and 
furniture that has been embellished for example with an extra 
fan carving so that it looks better or more expensive than the 
original piece 
the outright fraud made specifically to deceive is the rarest 
she says because it takes too much time and money to produce it 
and rarely would the anticipated price justify this kind of effort 
the best indication of authenticity is consistency adds kaye 
to ascertain if a piece is consistent look at each detail of 
construction separately she starts by sizing the piece up to get 
an overall impression then she opens and removes drawers looking 
at the back and base of cabinets and chairs she says that 
wellfinished unseen areas of furniture excite her suspicion 
because american cabinetmakers of the past rarely if ever 
finished parts that didnt show 
since there are no statistics there is no way to quantify the 
number of fakes according to pennington but awareness of the 
potential for faking old things is certainly increasing 
museumtrained experts have educated the public to look at old 
things with more awareness they have taught us that pieces without 
major restoration and in pristine condition are more valuable he 
said 
although any piece of furniture that is 200 years old would 
almost have to have some repairs when virtually rebuilt its claim 
to age might be at least debatable he said 
pennington says the growing public appetite for the country 
antique look has led to many reproductions of decorative wares the 
advantage is that you can buy a reproduction much less expensively 
than the real thing 
but if the new piece isnt indelibly marked eventually it will 
probably make its way into the antiques trade its difficult to 
tell age especially after an item has acquired some of the patina 
of age 
he advises not to buy art from a stranger who calls you up on 
the telephone buy from someone with a good reputation educate 
yourself and beware of things that are too good to be true or 
priced too low in comparison to the market

once those who could afford them invariably chose antiques over 
reproductions nowadays when the best original design is often 
unavailable too expensive the wrong dimensions or too fragile 
the reproduction can be the better choice 
this change in thinking is due to a variety of factors for one 
thing many reproductions now have more accurate finishes so they 
dont stick out like a sore thumb when mixed with antiques that 
means mixing a little old with a lot of new is a good method of 
getting the right look less expensively 
second an eclectic room is considered more desirable than the 
completely accurate period room that was once was fashionable 
comfort has become more important than historical accuracy for many 
people 
few decorators would hesitate to use plushly upholstered but 
anachronistic seating in a historic room especially since there 
really was no comfortable american upholstery in the 18th century 
according to decorator stanley hura 
in the dining room an extension table of modern origin is often 
a necessity and in the traditional bedroom or family room that 
lacks closets installing a modern wall system may be the only 
solution hura for example recently placed a floortoceiling 
wall system in an american traditional bedroom for needed storage 
space he gave the unit a builtin look by installing molding 
around it he said 
when combining old and new furniture of more than one style a 
few precautions can prevent the pieces from clashing with one 
another 
certain styles even though from different periods look good 
together says hura for example japanese shaker and scandinavian 
modern combine well english regency and chinese furniture work 
together the rounded forms of the 18thcentury french pieces and 
art nouveau and victorian also marry well 
if youre furnishing a formal victorian room and need storage 
remember that armoires are in character with that style if you 
have contemporary lacquered cabinetry add oriental or art deco 
accessories and reproductions at the windows you might choose 
pleated shades or shoji screens simple regency chairs would not be 
out of place in this room 
the forms of the pieces dictate how they combine you could 
mix a 17thcentury italian table and chairs and contemporary 
furniture and lamps because the lines work well together hura 
says 
doityourself decorators can learn their own taste preferences 
by studying decorating books and magazines 
the most appealing homes are the ones where people put 
together what they love the accurate period room is for museums 
not for living says hura 
one of the marks of an interesting room is the unexpected 
touches it contains especially in the form of accessories 
according to fran laufer who imports unusual accessories colorful 
and exotic items are in demand for example relatively affordable 
indian paintings on fabric known as pichwais and burmese 
embroideries are being selected by those seeking distinction 
without breaking the bank 
the decorators she deals with rarely take the item as shipped 
and use it in a room they further embellish it to make it more 
important for example one decorator created an unusual wall 
hanging from a large piece of burmese embroidered fabric she had 
it stuffed to give it dimension and bring out its interesting 
pattern then mounted it on silk linen and framed it in gold leaf 
before hanging it on a wall 
another decorator chose three colorful 22inch chinese porcelain 
jardinieres she had rosewood bases made for each one set them in 
place in a dining room and then had a oneinch thick glass top made 
to cover them creating a unique dining table 
designers often use antiquities such as etched bronze drums from 
thailand old korean vessels or wedding baskets from indonesia as 
cocktail table bases korean coin chests of a dark wood with iron 
hardware become side tables with storage capacity and coromandel 
screens are turned into cabinet fronts

the firsthome owner doesnt have to settle for makedo 
furniture because of a budget says a furnishings and design editor 
instead start with flexible basics that will look terrific 
right now and also will make great building blocks for future 
decorating schemes says denise l caringer of better homes and 
gardens magazine 
dont settle for lower quality and dont feel locked into a look 
or color scheme that will be difficult or costly to change later 
on instead she has these suggestions 
skip the busy wall coverings and fancy window wear instead 
slick up and unify the background with white paint white window 
blinds shades or curtains and if possible neutral floor 
coverings 
this will produce an airy expansive look and will also make a 
neutral canvas on which style can be easily created 
avoid matching suites of furniture instead choose a mix 
of welldesigned basics that can be shifted to other rooms or other 
homes a bedroom dresser for example has limited use but an 
armoire fits in virtually anywhere she says 
consider modular storage pieces bookcases and stacking cubes 
with optional doors drawers and shelves 
furnish a sitting spot with four wicker lounge chairs instead 
of buying an expensive sofa for the living room float the chairs 
in a cloverleafshaped grouping in the middle of the room and 
anchor them with an area rug wicker is versatile she says so you 
wont lock yourself into a changeless look fabric cushions can set 
the mood 
later on you can move them to a porch or split them up using a 
pair with a new sofa and moving the others to bedrooms 
if the living room does not have a natural focal point like a 
great window or a fireplace lean a secondhand fireplace surround 
against the wall and fill the opening with plants put two or three 
lowcost white bookcases together or place an antique bench or a 
couple of low chests side by side and hang an oversized poster 
above them 
stacked books next to a chair make a great resting place for a 
cup or glass turn a cube basket or a concrete block into a coffee 
table by topping it with a piece of glass 
simple welldesigned lamps such as flex arm architects 
lamps ceramicbase table lamps or sleek metal floor lamps can be 
supplemented with clampon spotlights to highlight artwork and 
canisterstyle uplights to wake up dull corners 
for dining a white outdoor table and casual chairs wicker 
molded plastic metal or woodandcanvas serve as 
summerhouse companions to the airy living room scheme for a 
more formal or traditional look buy quality dining chairs and team 
them with a round skirtedtothefloor dining table 
let your personality color the surroundings family photos 
seashells books baskets group small treasures for a bigger 
impact

ive never used a decorator because i like to be in control 
but im very aware of esthetics says boston stockbroker ginny 
houston so when she found a store that carried the unusual country 
style furniture and accessories she prefers she was delighted 
she still prefers to make all the final decisions but likes 
having access to fabrics sold only through decorators and to 
services such as drapery workrooms its a real time saver 
says houston who is typical of a new breed of home furnishings 
customers 
theyre sophisticated welltraveled affluent and aware of the 
latest decorating styles and they see no reason why they should be 
denied access to some furniture and accessories because they prefer 
not to hire a designer 
to cater to this new breed highstyle furniture stores have 
been opening in ever greater numbers across the country these 
stores are selling the public furnishings that formerly were 
available mainly through designers and architects many also show 
and sell the work of craftsmen which otherwise would be 
inaccessible 
what started as a mere trickle has grown to a goodsized stream 
not only in the largest population centers but in smaller cities 
all across the country stores like urban architecture in detroit 
oggi in kansas city mo current in seattle verlaine in 
providence ri and luminaire in the miami area 
these retailers are breaking down former barriers which may 
lead to a revolution in furniture retailing according to some 
observers by selling to both consumers and the trade often 
cutting prices below those of design showrooms and by developing 
alternative sources of supply among craftsmen and foreign 
manufacturers 
one example of the new style retailer is keith johnson who with 
several partners founded urban architecture in detroit the store 
carries highstyle contemporary italian design from memphis milano 
and 15 other italian manufacturers 
when i got started in this business i hated the idea that the 
public couldnt come in and that there was a double price system 
for the furniture says johnson who cut prices and sold to both 
designers and the general public 
his success proves there is a much larger market for advanced 
furniture design than most people imagine says the retailer 
lowering prices and putting the furniture on a retail sales 
floor where anybody can come in and see it he says will make the 
furniture as popular in the united states as it is in europe where 
it usually sells for much less 
i wanted to create a store for a new kind of customer one for 
whom the home is the status symbol of the 1990s says judy 
george who opened domain in chestnut hill mass in 1986 since 
then domain has grown to be a 10store chain in new england and 
more additions are planned 
george says its knowledge that defines her customers not 
necessarily affluence not all are rich but they are all very 
hip they travel like movies read shelter magazines and usually 
dont hire a decorator because they want to do it themselves she 
says 
its a small constituency but a very savvy one says susan 
symonds who started verlaine in providence about six years ago 
access to the fabrics and wallcoverings normally available only 
through decorators is so important to some customers that they call 
symonds from other areas of the country 
these clients find it frustrating to see things in magazines 
and then not to be able to buy them says symonds 
if knowledge is one aspect of the new customer lack of shopping 
time is another says george so a stores edited version of 
interesting new merchandise is a time saver 
we are doing russian gothic french country english chintz 
weve got rattan from poland weve got south american says 
george this group appreciates ethnic furnishings and likes to 
include something of their past in their home but if i get too 
serious i dont sell it 
in fact george and other retailers of this ilk rely on 
different resources than the usual she shops craft fairs to find 
talented people and then gives them a large enough order to enable 
them to set up production faculties currently 10 artists in 
vermont and three in maine make furnishings for domain 
although the newstyle stores have much in common withach is usually 
a reflection of the passions of the 
individual who started it rather than of a management game plan 
consequently most change merchandise frequently as the owner finds 
some new enthusiasm

the city and the country by judicious selection of some of its 
many elements moderne style decorating can range from a

ever since egypts king zoser built the step pyramid some 4600 
years ago stone has been a sign of elegance and strength in the 
field of building and furnishings 
egyptologists say zosers pyramid the worlds first major 
building in stone was considered a staircase to heaven some 
modern designers say the use of stone simulations brings an touch 
of richness and grace to the modern home 
this is the age of faux finishes the look of marble stone 
even wood achieved through creative techniques on everything from 
walls and floors to fabrics and accessories says designer janet 
carter 
the design emphasis for the 1990s is on texture and creating 
an illusion of depth the popularity of stone simulations has led 
to numerous fabric and furnishing accessories that add distinction 
and polish 
carter adds that with todays new faux finishes floors walls 
and furnishings can have the look and durability of stone without 
the hassles 
simple painting techniques for those even a little handy with 
a paint brush allow you to create the elegance of stone for one or 
all walls in a room explains carter a member of the color 
marketing group and american society of interior designers 
real stone from solid marble to delicate slate she says is 
hard to care for expensive to replace and often too heavy for 
residential walls and floors 
there is a strong trend toward contemporary designs in sheet 
vinyl floors stripes chevrons and banding combined with the look 
of stone capture a contemporary elegance for any environment 
says gerald ewan director of styling for mannington resilient 
floors 
some designers note that while the look of stone may be classic 
the homeowner should remember not to get carried away with a trend 
stone looks can either make a strong statement on walls floors 
and furnishings or create a subtle effect with accessories linens 
and pillows 
stone maintains its elegance when strategically placed to 
complement its surroundings says one industry observer

spains stock markets rose monday the 
first day of trading under a new system that introduced the most 
sweeping changes in the exchanges 158yearold history 
the reform known here as el big bang is designed to 
broaden the spanish markets trading base tighten disclosure 
controls to eliminate insider trading and bring the stock exchanges 
in line with others in europe 
provisional figures indicated the madrid general index reached 
30393 up 170 over friday valencia rose 176 points to 24506 
while barcelonas index registered 10647 up 73 points the 
bilbao market was closed due to a regional holiday 
dealers said trading on the three exchanges remained light 
largely due to investors concern about the changeover process and 
recent government moves to restrict credit and slow down the 
countrys overheated economy 
today was absolutely calm there were no problems and the 
market was up said jaime sanz spokesman for the madrid stock 
exchange where about 70 percent of all spanish trading takes place 
in a ceremony friday marking the last day of trading under the 
old system national securities commission president luis carlos 
croissier said the new market will be characterized by 
transparency greater technical capacity and competition 
the securities commission set up nine months ago to implement 
the june 1988 market reform law is the markets chief supervisory 
and watchdog authority 
the law which took effect saturday converted the four 
exchanges into private entities owned and managed by newly created 
brokerages and brokerdealer companies 
it eliminated civil servant stockbrokers monopoly on trading 
rights and eventually will integrate the stock exchanges in madrid 
barcelona bilbao and valencia into a single computer automated 
trading system 
fiftyone brokerages and brokerdealers have been registered on 
the madrid exchange but analysts say half of them may disappear 
within two years because of increased competition in the wake of 
the reform 
so far 23 companies whose shares account for 22 percent of 
trading volume have been listed on the computerized system set up 
in april and modeled after the one pioneered by the toronto stock 
exchange 
croissier has predicted that more than 50 percent of the total 
trading volume in spain would take place in the new system by the 
end of the year 
the old system where prices are fixed in two daily openoutcry 
sessions on the exchange floors is to exist side by side with 
continuous computerized trading until all shares switch over sanz 
said

two years after becoming the first major texas 
bank to be recapitalized with federal assistance banctexas group 
inc is seeking another government bailout 
the request made friday comes one week after the federal deposit 
insurance corp seized texas american bancshares inc and national 
bancorp of texas inc awarding them to new owners the fdic said 
at the time the move took care of major bank restructuring in texas 
banctexas group last week reported an 88 million loss in the 
second quarter compared to an 1112 million loss in the same 
period last year so far this year the bank has lost 1478 
million compared to 1702 million last year 
the losses dropped the holding companys primary capital ratio 
on june 30 to 53 percent with banctexasdallas at 23 percent 
well below the required 55 percent the dallas bank accounts for 
about half of the companys 77629 million in assets 
other subsidiary banks are banctexashouston with a capital 
ratio of 59 percent and banctexasmckinney at 49 percent 
this application contemplates that in conjunction with fdic 
financial assistance banctexas group and outside investors would 
make a substantial capital infusion into banctexasdallas the 
company said 
if assistance is granted by the fdic to banctexasdallas 
banctexas group should be able to assist the other two banks in 
meeting the new capital requirements 
chairman nathan c collins said while it is not possible at 
this time to predict the exact effect on the stockholders of 
banctexas group it is probable that if the assistance is granted 
their interest will be substantially diluted as a result of the new 
capital injection 
banctexas was recapitalized in 1987 with 150 million in federal 
assistance plus 50 million from the hallwood group inc a 
clevelandbased investment firm 
at the time that seemed as if it would be enough but 
continuing deterioration of the states real estate market 
undermined the banks recovery bank spokesman jim miller said 
the bank said it had 6412 million in nonperforming assets on 
june 30 with 2475 million allowance for loan losses the company 
charged 10 million worth of bad loans during the quarter 
about a third of the banks portfolio is in real estate miller 
said 
banctexas has been sounding warning signals for about nine 
months miller said earlier the bank has acknowledged talking to 
outside groups in search of additional capital 
the bank however has declined to comment on reports other 
banks were reviewing its books the dallas morning news has 
reported hibernia corp a louisiana holding company was invited 
to study the banks books

chinas airline administration said monday it was 
cutting prices on 71 domestic routes by 20 percent through december 
in an effort to attract more passengers 
ticket prices to hong kong and abroad will not be reduced the 
official xinhua news agency said quoting the civil aviation 
administration of china which runs chinas regional and 
international airlines 
the announcement said only that the aim was to lure more 
passengers it said the number of people flying on chinas 
airlines fell by half a million in june over the previous june and 
that the number of foreign travelers was down 54 percent over the 
same period it did not give the actual number of travelers 
more than 43 million tourists visited china in 1988 on 
organized tours alone and millions more came individually but 
tourism has virtually halted since the army crushed a studentled 
prodemocracy movement june 34 
the number of chinese travelers also has dropped as the 
government has ordered a cutback in the number of regional and 
national meetings which in the past often were an excuse for 
jaunts to scenic cities 
some cities branches of the staterun tour agency have 
announced discounts of up to 20 percent on package tour rates and 
individual hotels in beijing and many other cities are offering 
offseason rates and other specials a few hotels have virtually 
shut down

several major commercial banks including the 
nations largest lowered their prime lending rates a half 
percentage point today to 105 percent signaling lower borrowing 
costs for consumers and businesses 
first bank of chicago was the first to take the step shortly 
before the opening of the stock market with chemical bank 
continenal bank morgan guaranty trust co manufacturers hanover 
trust co bankers trust co and no 1 citibank joining in 
the reduction effective immediately follows similar cuts by 
san franciscobased bank of america on friday and chase manhattan 
bank more than three weeks ago a few other smaller banks have 
reduced their prime rates since chases move 
the prime rate reflects a banks costs of borrowing money 
including interest it pays on savings accounts or certificates of 
deposit and trails more subtle increases in other interest rates 
the rate is watched closely because bankers use it as a basis 
for calculating loans to businesses and for determining many types 
of fixed and adjustablerate consumer loans mortgage rates are not 
included in that category 
todays decrease was widely expected by most economists due to 
continuing signs that the federal reserve is seeking looser credit 
policies in response to a slowdown in economic growth 
economists have speculated that major banks did not immediately 
follow chase which cut its prime rate on july 10 partly because 
they wanted to determine whether the fed would keep pursuing lower 
interest rates 
the sentiment in the marketplace was that chase was too early 
and everyone else was waiting until the federal funds rate stayed 
below 9 percent said elizabeth g reiners an economist with 
dean wittter reynolds inc 
the federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans between 
banks traded at 8 percent by late morning today down from 8 
1516 percent friday the fed controls the rate by adding or 
subtracting banking reserves 
other interest rates in the credit markets have been falling 
steadily the yield on the widely watched 30year treasury bond 
finished below 8 percent friday for the first time since spring 
1987 closing at 7985 it traded lower at 795 percent by late 
morning today as bond prices rose 
stock prices however were down slightly in latemorning 
trading 
the prime stood at 105 percent at the start of 1989 it was 
raised twice in february to 115 percent then lowered a half 
percentage point on june 5 those movements reflected changing 
concerns about economic growth and inflation

a threeweek national dockworkers strike foundered 
monday as more laborers returned to their jobs after employers 
threatened to fire those who didnt resume work 
but 480 dockers at bristol went against the national trend when 
they voted at a private meeting to continue to stay out over 
government plans to abolish guaranteed lifelong employment 
port employers said the returns on monday meant that 3668 or 
57 percent of dockers affected by the job guarantee program were 
working and 2741 remained on strike forty of the 60 ports 
affected by the strike were working normally they said 
clearly more than 50 percent of dockers are back at work they 
have voted with their feet and i hope the transport and general 
workers union will heed their wishes and call off this strike 
said nick finney director of the national association of port 
employers 
but opposition labor party lawmaker michael meacher said sunday 
on british broadcasting corp radio the reason is not lack of 
support for the cause but the intimidation and blackmail involved 
in threats of sackings 
the swing away from the strike came after dockers leaders voted 
decisively on friday to intensify the dispute and try to get 
working dockers to rejoin the strike 
john connolly the unions national docks secretary said sunday 
the votes to return to work were disappointing but not totally 
unexpected 
they would not affect the unions decision to step up the 
dispute he said adding we will continue to try to persuade 
those members who have returned to change their minds

more favorable drilling conditions due to drier 
weather in northern louisiana and northeast texas helped raise the 
number of working oil and gas rigs by 40 to total 870 this week 
baker hughes inc reported monday 
the rig count remained lower than the comparable period a year 
ago when it totaled 894 last week the rig count jumped 10 to 
total 830 
during the last nine weeks the rig count has increased eight 
times 
about 25 of that increase of 40 was attributed to ground 
drying out in the arklatex region said ike kerridge baker 
hughes vice president the arklatex region includes northern 
louisiana and northeastern texas 
wet grounds makes it impossible to move rigs kerridge said 
if youre out in the middle of a corn field you just cant move 
the rigs and you have to wait for the ground to dry 
tropical storm allison caused widespread flooding in texas and 
louisiana in june and monday tropical storm chantal was in the 
gulf of mexico and could cause more heavy rains in the area 
kerridge said 
the companys rig count the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity reflects the number of rigs actively exploring 
for oil as of last friday not the number of rigs actively 
producing oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 
per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in 
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures

chrysler corp said monday that sales of minivans 
and jeeps pushed secondquarter profits 66 percent higher than a 
year earlier when incentive costs hurt earnings 
chairman lee a iacocca said deep cost cuts including 
eliminating 2300 whitecollar jobs by the end of the year should 
help chrysler meet stiffening competition in the automotive market 
later this year 
chrysler said it earned 341 million or 146 a share for the 
three months ended june 30 compared with 320 million or 145 a 
share in the same 1988 period 
revenue for the quarter totaled 101 billion up from 934 
billion a year ago the countrys thirdlargest automaker said 
the increases contrasted with last weeks reports of a 34 
percent quarterly decline in earnings at gm and a 154 percent drop 
at ford but chrysler was comparing with a weak second quarter in 
1988 
they had very poor profit last year they were pushing heavily 
on incentives and their mix of models was weak said automotive 
analyst david healy of drexel burnham lambert inc in new york 
for the first six months of the year chrysler reported earnings 
of 692 million or 296 a share on revenue of 201 billion 
that was up from 504 million or 227 a share on revenue of 
179 billion in the first half of 1988 
chrysler said incentive costs are still rising by 20 percent 
over the yearearlier period 
this year chrysler said jeep sales were up 19 percent from last 
years second quarter and the company continued its dominance in 
the sale of minivans commanding 54 percent of sales 
iacocca said sales were helped by the dodge spirit and plymouth 
acclaim models that replaced chryslers kseries compact cars and 
by more expensive models such as the chrysler new yorker landau 
the company increased rebates to help lagging sales of 
lowerpriced models such as the plymouth sundance dodge shadow 
plymouth horizon and dodge omni 
iacocca predicted gains from last weeks move to cut 1 billion 
in costs by year end by deeply cutting chryslers whitecollar work 
force 
weve got aggressive internal costcontrol measures in place 
and we plan to continue strong emphasis on cost reductions as a 
means of enhancing our competitive position he said these 
moves will help us face head on the most competitive automotive 
market the world has ever seen 
healy said the cost cuts may not help soon however i dont 
think theyll have much effect on 1989 profits i think they can 
bring the savings on stream during the course of 1990 he said 
gm reported secondquarter earnings of 145 billion and ford 
said it earned 14 billion 
chryslers earnings brought big three profits to 320 billion 
for the quarter down from last years secondquarter total of 
349 billion and record firstquarter 1989 profits of 354 
billion for the three 
each of the big three has spent hundreds of dollars per vehicle 
on incentives during the second quarter to try to boost sales and 
shrink inventories in a sluggish car and truck market 
chrysler said last week it was spending about 700 per car ford 
said it spent 600 to 700 per car on incentives during the second 
quarter gm declined to say what it spent but said it exceeded 
1988s spending of about 700 per car

nearly 75 percent of the nations thrifts already 
meet tougher capital standards proposed in the governments 
multibilliondollar bailout bill according to a study released 
monday 
the study by alex sheshunoff amp co an austinbased consulting 
firm said the findings show that clearly this requirement isnt 
an unbearable burden for the healthy segment of the savings and 
loan industry 
congress is scheduled this week to consider a 157 billion 
bailout bill for the industry which is losing an estimated 20 
million a day among other components the bill requires thrifts to 
have a 3 percent capitaltoassets ratio 
the bill allows half of the capital initially to be in socalled 
goodwill or intangible assets by jan 1 1995 the entire 3 
percent must be in tangible assets 
the bill has been approved by a housesenate conference 
committee but sen phil gramm rtexas has threatened to block 
passage in a dispute over financing 
sheshunoff said his review of the financial status of the 
nations 2946 thrifts found 73 percent or 2163 already meet the 
3 percent core capital requirement contained in the bush 
administrations bailout bill 
in addition sheshunoff said 1984 of the thrifts or 67 
percent can meet the 1995 requirement with tangible assets only 
whie 25 of the nations 40 largest thrifts including 12 of the 
top 13 already meet the 1995 standard the number drops to 12 
including eight of the top 13 if only tangible assets are counted 
sheshunoff said that of the 1984 wellcapitalized sampls the 
average tangible capitaltoassets ratio is 6 percent which puts 
them in a strong position to acquire undercapitalized thrifts 
the difference between the higher interest rates paid by sampls 
for deposits and those paid by banks should narrow sheshunoff 
said of the bailout bill as a result borrowers particularly 
homebuyers may see a decline in interest costs on mortgages 
of the 2163 thrifts with more than 3 percent capital 
sheshunoff said 1886 or 872 percent were profitable of the 783 
that dont meet the 3 percent standard 277 or 354 percent were 
profitable 
sheshunoff based his study on data in the march 31 1989 thrift 
financial reports of the federal home loan bank board

adolph coors co the nations no 4 
brewing company is holding discussions with the stroh brewing co 
the no 3 beermaker that could lead to coors becoming a minority 
partner company officials said monday 
details of the discussions were unavailable coors vice 
president of development robert klugman said the talks were 
preliminary 
because we have no agreements we are not able to comment 
further said anita russell a spokeswoman for the goldenbased 
brewery 
jack barthwell vice president of corporate communications and 
government affairs for the detroitbased stroh said in a statement 
that the discussions are part of an effort launched by stroh in 
february to explore partnership opportunities 
stroh in february hired morgan stanley amp co to find someone 
to buy a minority position in the company barthwell said in a 
telephone interview 
he said the talks with coors are part of that process which has 
involved discussions with other international brewers as well 
although we will confirm that discussions have occurred with 
representatives from coors it should be clearly understood that 
nothing discussed with coors would cause stroh to alter its 
schedule of meetings with other brewers barthwell said in his 
statement 
as previously stated stroh will continue exploring numerous 
alternatives to profitably restructure and strengthen its business 
regardless of rumors and speculation his statement said 
stroh is privately owned and does not release production or 
earnings figures besides making stroh beer products the brewery 
also produces old milwaukee schlitz and schaefer beer 
coors in april announced a firstquarter loss of 48 million 
compared with a 37 million profit or 10 cents per share during 
the same period of 1988 it was coors first loss in its 15 years 
as a public company the company blamed a drop in beer shipments 
and higher manufacturing costs for the loss 
during this years first quarter coors net sales were up 129 
percent to 324 million beer shipments during the period totaled 
3 million barrels down 55 percent

more currently when the politics of taxation arise some of the

otherwise stick to the facts 
everyone has heard them the rich live off the taxes of the 
poor the rich pay no taxes the middle class pays most of the 
taxes the poor are taxed disproportionately high 
seeking facts rather than assumptions the nonpartisan tax 
foundation went back through treasury department and internal

percent of the federal individual income tax bill 
in spite of numerous changes in the law the percentage has held 
for at least a decade 
the foundation found that in 1987 43 percent of all federal

president bush on monday vetoed legislation to 
impose conditions on the usnegotiated deal to coproduce an 
advanced jet fighter with the japanese saying it would damage 
prospects for an agreement 
i cannot accept binding provisions that would tie my hands 
in the exercise of my constitutional responsibilities bush said 
in a veto message 
he said the legislation would inject the general accounting 
office an agency of the legislative branch into the 
administration of the jet program in a highly intrusive manner 
trespassing on the constitutional powers of the president 
to reopen discussions now for additional and needless changes 
can only damage the prospects for a successful agreement the 
president said 
if this occurs substantial injury to the usjapan security 
relationship is likely and the considerable stragetic and 
commercial benefits to the united states will be lost this 
compromising of us interests is simply not acceptable 
the agreement negotiated earlier this year by bush 
administration officials with officials of the japanese government 
called for development by general dynamics and mitsubishi heavy 
industries of an advanced version of the f16 fighter named fsx 
which was to be deployed by japan in the 1990s the deal envisioned 
a 6 billion pricetag 
a house measure to restrict the deal was passed in early june on 
a 262155 vote but that was far less than the twothirds margin of 
290 needed to override a veto in the 435member chamber an 
identical senate resolution passed 7227 on may 16 
the administration already had agreed to develop the fighter 
jointly with japan the measure passed in the house june 7 sought 
to stipulate the us negotiating position in future talks on how 
the fsx would actually be produced 
opponents of the fsx deal as negotiated by the bush 
administration said that it amounted to a giveaway of critical us 
defense technology but the administration argued at the time that 
the restrictive legislation would tie its hands in the talks 
the legislation stated that any agreement on coproduction of the 
fsx should guarantee that at least 40 percent of the work 
including provision of spare parts would be handled by american 
companies 
it also sought to prohibit transfer to japan of critical 
american jet engine technology and bar japan from selling to third 
countries the fsx or any of the planes major subcomponents 
there was no immediate indication monday of why bush vetoed the 
bill although it was said to have been spelled out in the letter 
to various lawmakers no copies of the letter were immediately 
available on capitol hill 
but two members of congress immediately said they would fight to 
override the veto 
with his veto of the bipartisan bill to safeguard americas 
interests in the fsx deal with japan president bush is giving away 
our best technology and our best jobs house majority leader 
richard gephardt dmo said in a statement 
gephardt said that bush gave shortshrift consideration to the 
impact the fsx deal would have on the us economy and on american 
workers in particular 
rep david bonior dmich said the veto signaled to the 
world that the united states will not flex its muscle to protect 
the american worker 
if japan is serious about softening its trade surplus with the 
united states it would buy f16s directly from us makers he 
said but he noted a series of trade barriers japan erects to 
american agriculture and electronic equipment 
we cant tell the rest of the world were tough on trade if 
were cutting sweetheart deals with the very same people who break 
the rules he said im committed to overriding this veto

lower us interest rates sapped strength monday 
from the dollar which fell to springtime levels against major 
foreign currencies 
the drop in interest rates has wiped out the dollar rally that 
reached its peak in june taking the dollar back to levels of may 
against the british pound and japanese yen april against the west 
german mark and march against the swiss franc 
the dollars sharpest drop came against the yen which has 
surged ahead following the brief decline that occurred in the july 
political upheaval traders said there was optimism that japans 
governing partner would select a new prime minister shortly 
most of the dollars decline came in europe trading in the 
united states was thin and choppy with most interbank trading 
ending by noon because of endofthemonth squaring of the books 
the federal reserve has been lowering interest rates to 
encourage borrowing and stimulate the sluggish us economy as a 
side effect the lower rates make dollardenominated securities 
less attractive to global investors 
the dollar did not seem to gain from the crisis atmosphere 
surrounding claims by proiranian shiite moslems in lebanon that 
they executed an american military officer often the dollar is 
seen as a safe haven in times of international trouble 
people are still concerned with interest rates coming off 
said michael miskulin a trader at industrial bank of japan trust 
co in new york as for the lebanon situation i think people are 
used to that sort of situation now he said 
the yens climb began in asia monday triggered by a large order 
to sell marks for yen in singapore

coffee futures prices tumbled below 80 cents a pound to a 
13year low on monday as the market continued its monthlong 
search for support following the collapse of a pricestabilization 
agreement 
on other markets precious metals and crude oil futures rallied 
grain and soybean futures fell sharply and livestock and meat 
futures were mixed 
green unroasted coffee settled 175 cents to 303 cents lower 
on new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange with the contract for 
delivery in september at 7899 cents a pound the lowest settlement 
for a nearmonth contract since early 1976 
the price plunge followed a weekend meeting of latin american 
foreign ministers in colombia where the coffee market was 
discussed 
no action was taken but brazil and colombia respectively the 
worlds first and secondlargest coffee producers issued a 
statement after the meeting saying they supported higher prices 
the market essentially shrugged its shoulders and said so 
what said arthur stevenson a new yorkbased coffee market 
analyst with prudentialbache securities inc 
obviously in the deregulated market no producer wants to see 
lower prices he said 
coffee futures were trading near 114 a pound at the beginning 
of july and have fallen steadily following the international coffee 
organizations suspension of export quotas on july 3 the quotas 
were designed to stabilize prices by limiting the amount of green 
coffee that producer countries could sell to consumer countries 
within the 74nation organization 
the quota suspension triggered a battle among coffee producers 
who have been aggressively cutting their prices in hopes of raising 
their sales and their market share 
but coffee roasters in consumer countries have been very 
lackadaisical in their buying because they anticipate the 
abundance of coffee supplies to drive prices even lower said 
analyst sandra kaul of shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
roaster demand is typically slack in the summer because coffee 
consumption goes down in the warm months 
silver futures prices rebounded strongly on new yorks commodity 
exchange regaining all the ground lost in fridays selloff 
peter cardillo of josephthal amp co in new york said a weaker 
dollar lower interest rates and concerns about middle eastern 
stability helped support the market which initially rose on 
technical factors 
silver settled 12 cents to 132 cents higher with september at 
5313 a troy ounce gold was 330 to 350 higher with august at

the stock price of lin broadcasting corp 
slipped monday after the companys deadline for a negotiated buyout 
agreement with mccaw cellular communications inc passed without an 
agreement 
lin a new yorkbased cellular telephone television 
broadcasting and publishing concern said its board would pursue 
other options 
mccaw the nations largest cellular telephone operator has an 
outstanding hostile tender offer of 110 a share for the 902 
percent of lins stock that it doesnt already own lin says the 
offer is inadequate 
in national overthecounter trading monday lin fell 62 cents 
a share to 109 while mccaw lost 1 a share to close at 37 
the two companies disclosed in midjuly that they were talking 
about a possible buyout at 12750 a share but mccaw which is 
based in kirkland wash said july 21 it had suspended those talks 
pending further review 
subsequently lin set a 9 am edt monday deadline for reaching 
a definitive agreement under which mccaw would acquire lin stock 
for 12750 a share an offer that would value lins 539 million 
shares at nearly 69 billion 
lin has given mccaw every reasonable opportunity to enter into 
a merger agreement at the agreed price of 12750 said lin 
chairman donald pels 
but mccaw called the deadline arbitrary and is continuing to 
review the situation mccaw spokesman steve bruce said monday in 
the meantime mccaw still feels its 110 a share offer which 
expires aug 11 is fair he said 
pels said the 110 per share offer is inadequate and clearly 
not in the best interests of lin stockholders 
lins board of directors intends to pursue other options in 
order to protect and enhance stockholder values he said 
previously lin has proposed spinning off its seven television 
stations as a company separate from its cellular telephone and 
specialty publishing operations which creates hardcover magazines 
for placement in hotel rooms 
the company has also previously indicated that it was in talks 
with a third party that it declined to identify

of 308 billion in the second quarter of 1988 unocal earned 64 
million or 55 cents per share on revenue of 257 billion

commodities traders and brokers from the chicago 
board of trade and the chicago mercantile exchange have turned down 
government plea bargain offers a newspaper reported monday 
the 40 traders from the two exchanges are expected to be 
indicted this week on charges of racketeering or mail or wire 
fraud and could face sentences of 30 to 38 months in prison if 
convicted the chicago suntimes reported 
the government team headed by paul coffey the washingtonbased 
deputy chief of the justice departments organized crime and 
racketeering sections also is threatening traders with loss of 
their seats on the exchanges and confiscation of their homes cars 
and other possessions the suntimes said 
the government team proposed a deal to defense lawyers during 
weekend meetings that the traders plead guilty to alleged illegal 
trades and cooperate with prosecutors the newspaper reported 
but the newspaper said lawyers for the traders and brokers 
rejected the government offer while no specific promises were 
made the implication was that the defendants would get better 
treatment if they cooperated the newspaper said 
some defense attorneys said their clients would make restitution 
for the alleged illegal trades but the offers were turned down 
the newspaper reported the report said other lawyers offered to 
have their clients plead guilty to misdemeanors but the government 
insisted on felony charges 
a felony conviction could bar a trader from returning to the 
floor 
a 2year investigation in the case involved undercover federal 
agents placed in the merc and cbot armed with concealed 
microphones the agents focused on the swaggering types and 
people who displayed extravagant lifestyles an unidentified source

gte corp failed to tell home shopping 
network its telephone system couldnt handle an evergrowing number 
of calls costing the video retailer millions of dollars an hsn 
attorney told a jury monday 
attorney chester kamin contended in his final arguments that gte 
knew in 1986 that the situation had become so bad that 2500 calls 
every five minutes were not making it into hsns headquarters here 
in a 15 billion fraud suit filed in pinellas circuit court 
hsn claims it lost millions of calls and about 500 million in 
potential sales because the the gte equipment couldnt handle the 
call volume in 1986 and early 1987 
gte florida and its parent company gte corp of stamford 
conn in turn filed a slander suit against hsn claiming the 
losses were actually due to the electronic retailers unbridled 
growth and customer dissatisfaction 
the trial which has lasted six weeks was to resume tuesday 
morning with final arguments from the attorney for gte 
since presiding judge howard rives has already instructed the 
jury on laws pertaining to the case it could go into deliberation 
as soon as tuesday afternoon 
in a summation that lasted more than three hours kamin said gte 
is trying to muddle the case with its counterclaim he described 
gte as a giant octupus that squirts ink so you cant see it 
what you see in this courtroom is ink ink ink to keep you 
from seeing whats going on kamin said 
kamin accused gte of greed in declining to give hsn early notice 
of problems so steps could be taken to correct the situation he 
said gte only wanted to keep the money made by the telephone 
network 
kamin said the crux of the problem was that gte which knew 
early on of hsns plans to expand didnt put in enough lines to 
handle hsns calls we lost calls and thats all there is to it 
in one year hsns cable audience soared from 9 million to 465 
million

occidental petroleum corp said monday that 
it was again pumping north sea oil a year after 167 men died when 
its piper alpha platform exploded off scotland and half a year 
after it had hoped to resume production 
occidental oil from the alpha claymore and scapa fields in the 
british sector of the north sea had flowed through the huge alpha 
platform which exploded in flames on july 6 1988 and was 
destroyed 
the big oil company said last august that it hoped to resume 
north sea production by the end of the year but it was not until 
saturday that it began pumping oil from the scapa field through the 
claymore platform at about 17000 barrels per day according to the 
announcement monday 
occidental chairman armand hammer said production is expected to 
reach about 100000 barrels per day later this year 
the company said it had installed underwater emergency shutdown 
valves on all platforms leading to and from the claymore platform 
and had taken other safety measures in accordance with industry 
guidelines issued by the united kingdom department of energy 
occidental has offered 187 million in compensation to the 
families of the victims but negotiations continue with their 
attorneys 
occidentals secondquarter earnings announced last week fell 
to 26 million from 78 million in 1988 due in large part to 
exploration and production losses from the north sea disaster

declining production at prudhoe bay 
will mean a decrease of almost 10 percent in the next two years in 
oil flow through the transalaska pipeline state and industry 
officials say 
alyeska pipeline service co a consortium of the north slope 
oil producers said monday that some of the production slippage of 
100000 barrels a day this year is attributable to the spill by the 
exxon valdez 
the oil spill accounted for about 12 million barrels of lost 
opportunity reducing the average by 32000 barrels a day said 
alyeska spokesman tom brennan but 60000 barrels was due to 
field production decline and producer maintenance 
the average daily flow through the pipeline is expected to drop 
another 75000 barrels next year 
prudhoe bay accounts for threequarters of the production on the 
north slope which provides about onefourth of the nations 
domestic oil supply 
brennan said the average daily flow in the pipeline is expected 
to drop from 2 million barrels to 19 million this year and to 183 
million in 1990 
the prudhoe bay field the largest in the united states began 
producing in 1977 
chuck logsdon the states chief petroleum economist said that 
more than half of the estimated 10 billion barrels in the reservoir 
have been drained he said production is expected to drop 12 
percent to 15 percent a year 
logsdon said none of the other producing fields on the north 
slope is large enough to compensate for the prudhoe bay falloff 
the production decline will cost the state of alaska 175 
million in lost taxes and royalties over the next two years 
logsdon says the state gets about 85 percent of its revenue from 
oil
