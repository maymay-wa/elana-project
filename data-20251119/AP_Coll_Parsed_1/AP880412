a guyanese immigrant convicted of killing his 
girlfriend and four members of her family in a jealous rage lost 
appeals tuesday in state and federal courts in his lastminute bid 
to avoid the electric chair 
the louisiana supreme court and then us district judge peter 
beer refused to put off the execution of leslie lowenfield 34 
which is set for early wednesday 
lowenfields attorneys then went to the 5th us circuit court 
of appeals with the plea that he is mentally ill and therefore 
unable to understand the death penalty 
at the louisiana state penitentiary warden hilton butler said 
lowenfield was still hoping for a fifth delay of as many execution 
dates 
butler said lowenfield spurned the condemneds customary last 
meal and spent the evening with dale brown the head basketball 
coach from louisiana state university 
brown widely recognized as a motivational speaker had been 
corresponding with lowenfield since he took the lsu team on a tour 
of angolas death row in 1984 butler said 
a catholic priest and nun also were with lowenfield the warden 
said 
lowenfield a welder from guyana who came to the united states 
in 1981 on a work permit was convicted in 1984 in the august 1982 
slayings of his estranged girlfriend who was a jefferson parish 
sheriffs deputy and four others 
the case has already been appealed unsuccessfully to both the 
states highest court and the us supreme court lawyers based 
their latest appeal on a recent psychological study that found the 
prisoner to be a paranoid schizophrenic 
there is a serious question about leslies competency to be 
executed due to his mental illness said judith menadue attorney 
for the louisiana capital defense project 
she said the us supreme court has ruled that people who cannot 
understand what it means to be executed may not be put to death 
before the trial lowenfield was found competent and he refused 
to allow his lawyers to use insanity as a defense insisting 
instead that he was in florida at the time the family was killed 
but no witnesses backed up his story of being out of state 
the denial of the stay was issued without further comment from 
the state supreme court majority but the one member who backed the 
appeal issued a brief dissent 
the clinical psychologist who spent five hours with the 
defendant concluded lowenfield indicated that he is currently 
unable to understand the death penalty justice john a dixon 
wrote 
he noted that criminal law calls for halting prosecution when 
there are reasonable grounds to doubt a defendants sanity and for 
going ahead after that only when the defendant is found to have the 
mental capacity to do so 
prosecutors said lowenfield barged into his girlfriends house 
in marrero a new orleans suburb and shot everybody there 
the victims were the girlfriend sheila thomas 27 her 
daughter shantel osborne 4 her stepfather owen griffin 45 her 
mother myrtle griffin 44 and the little girls father carl 
osborne 33 
the prosecution said lowenfield was jealous of miss thomas they 
said the couple had lived together in a stormy relationship until 
earlier in the summer of 1982 when he set the house on fire and she 
moved out 
investigators found a notebook full of obscenities and threats 
in one place he wrote she have to go to the wormes she took all 
i work for then leave to go and be with carl but i just cannot take 
it eany more 
lowenfield was arrested two months later in new york 
parts of the evidence against him were letters he wrote miss 
thomas relatives while he was jailed in new york one said osborne 
had grabbed the child as a shield and lowenfield had shot both of 
them 
on trial lowenfield insisted on an alibi defense saying he was 
in jacksonville fla looking for work at the time of the murders 
after a separate trial to determine the penalty jurors came 
back three times saying they could not decide whether he should 
die prodded on by the judge they decided on the fourth try to 
condemn him to death

has moved to the pacific northwest and recently told the associated 
press through an intermediary that she did not want to be 
interviewed further about singleton 
the ledger said it obtained a copy of a 12page typewritten 
complaint in which singleton alleges vincent committed kidnap for

lowrent district in sacramento and never saw her again the

he allowed one of the hitchhikers to drive while he was drinking 
passed out then awoke to find vincent was gone but her clothes 
were still in the van 
the hitchhikers he has contended committed the crimes 
authorities however have maintained the two hitchhikers never 
existed 
singleton said in a telephone interview he mailed the complaint 
saturday to authorities in the two counties but court clerks in 
both counties said monday morning they had not received the 
complaints the ledger reported

soybean market prices are averaging the most 
in three years because of greater world demand and a tightening of 
available supplies an agriculture department analysis shows 
drought has damaged brazils soybean crop and the european 
economic community has increased its demand for the oilseed the 
departments economic research service said monday that has helped 
whittle down us soybean stockpiles and boost prices 
the supplyanddemand report said soybean prices now could 
average in the range of 550 to 580 per bushel in the marketing 
year that began last sept 1 up from 535 to 575 forecast in 
march prices averaged 478 per bushel in the 198687 season

soybean exports were forecast at 785 million bushels up from 
760 million indicated last month and the 757 million bushels 
shipped in 198687

agriculture department scientists are looking 
at the neem tree of asia and africa as a possible source of 
material to prevent the formation of aflatoxin a food toxin that 
occurs in nature 
aflatoxin can be produced by fungi that forms on some farm crops 
under certain conditions including corn and oilseeds laboratory 
tests with animals have shown that aflatoxin is among the most 
powerful cancercausing agents known and usda has called it a 
potential hazard to humans 
deepak bhatnagar said in a report released here that as a child 
in india his parents used to put leaves of the neem tree inside 
containers of wheat to keep insects from the grain now as a usda 
scientist he has found that the leaves may also block fungi from 
producing aflatoxin 
in tests at the departments agricultural research service 
center in new orleans la bhatnagar made solutions containing 
neem leaves he found that the solutions didnt kill the fungi but 
did block more than 98 percent of the aflatoxin they normally would 
have produced 
the fungi that produce the toxin are aspergillus flavus and a 
parasiticus 
bhatnagar said the results were promising but preliminary 
and that greenhouse studies with cotton are now being planned 
the ornamental neem is also known as margosa and nim more than 
80 insect pests including mexican bean beetles colorado potato 
beetles tobacco budworms and carpet beetles are repelled by neem 
extracts

millions of young americans are filling out 
federal tax returns for the first time as fridays filing deadline 
approaches and many of them are learning that you dont always get 
a refund 
several new provisions affecting students who work parttime and 
youngsters under the age of 14 took effect in 1987 and are being 
felt on returns filed this year the net effect is to complicate 
the finances of these people and in many cases of their parents 
the internal revenue service estimates 33 million people are 
having to file returns for the first time because a section of the 
1986 law denies a personal exemption worth 1900 for 1987 to 
those who can be claimed as a dependent by a parent or someone else 
in addition young people can lose a good portion of their 
2540 standard deduction by being claimed by a parent and 
thresholds for filing are lower than in the past 
two other new provisions 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
any child 5 or older who is claimed as a dependent must have a 
social security number which must be listed on the parents 
return the irs has waived the penalty for not listing the number 
on 1987 returns but its still required 
any investment income exceeding 1000 received by a child 
under 14 is now taxed at the parents higher rate assuming that is 
higher than the childs rate these calculations must be made on 
form 8615 which must be attached to the childs return 
congress imposed this requirement to block mainly higherincome 
parents from avoiding taxes by shifting incomeproducing property 
to a child under the old law a parent could have avoided 390 of 
tax on 1000 worth of interest that was credited to the childs 
account paying 110 instead of 500 
this kiddie tax provision has been a source of anguish for 
taxpayers experts say there is more confusion in trying to fill 
out the forms than there is surprise about so many minors having to 
file for the first time says vern martens senior tax attorney 
at merrill lynch headquarters in new york 
three other new forms are causing questions too although 
relatively few of the 107 million couples and individuals who are 
expected to file returns this year will have to face them they are 
8598 which fewer than 1 million people will have to file to 
calculate how much of their home mortgage interest is deductible 
it generally applies only to those whose outstanding mortgage and 
home equity loans total more than the purchase price of the home 
and any improvements 
8606 required mainly of middle and upperincome taxpayers who 
make nondeductible contributions to an ira 
8582 for calculating losses on rental operations and other 
passiveactivity investments 
if you dont feel ready to tackle any of these forms or the 
basic 1040 or 1040a you might consider filing form 4868 filing 
this form and your check for what you estimate you owe by 
midnight friday will give you an extra four months to file your 
return 
if you underestimate your taxes you will be liable for interest 
and penalty on the shortage but the fourmonth reprieve might keep 
you from rushing into a mistake 
the irs expects about 6 million couples and individuals to ask 
for the automatic delay about 1 million more than last year irs 
spokesman wilson fadely cautions if you wait until the last day 
to look at the library or post office for the form you may not 
find one 
the irs expects 37 million returns during the three weeks ending 
april 22 more than 58 million had been received by april 1 some 
of the remainder will be filed after the deadline some will come 
later from military personnel stationed abroad and some taxpayers 
have different deadlines 
the irs has processed 81 percent of the returns received so far 
down slightly from last year more than 77 percent are getting 
refunds compared with 78 percent at this time last year refunds 
are averaging 825 up from 806 
although tax rates were cut many people are paying more tax 
because all or parts of several deductions were lost these include 
sales taxes consumer interest medical expenses such 
miscellaneous itemized writeoffs as union dues the special 
deduction for twoearner couples and in many cases some or all 
the deduction for individual retirement account contributions

treasury secretary james a baker iii seems to 
be making progress in his drive to get the worlds top economic 
powers to use the price of gold and other commodities to help them 
coordinate economic policies 
baker took economic leaders by surprise when he advanced the 
idea last september with some countries openly skeptical 
but baker has demonstrated considerable skill as one of the 
administrations top negotiators and officials indicated monday 
that the worlds seven top industrial countries are likely to give 
formal approval to bakers commodityindex proposal on wednesday 
the seven nations the united states japan west germany 
britain france italy and canada will hold highlevel talks in 
washington as part of the spring meeting of the 151nation 
international monetary fund 
a senior treasury department official briefing reporters 
monday said the administration is hopeful there will be some 
agreement by the seven countries to adopt the commoditybasket 
proposal the official spoke on condition his name not be used 
baker has stressed that he is not proposing a return to the gold 
standard the system in use for 25 years after world war ii for 
most of that time the price of gold was fixed at 35 an ounce and 
the currencies of other countries were pegged at fixed exchange 
rates to the dollar 
that system broke down in the early 1970s under the weight of 
higher inflation and a rising flow of international capital between 
countries it was replaced with todays floating exchange rate 
system under which the value of each nations currency is set on 
the open market 
but the extreme volatility in floating rates especially for the 
us dollar has driven the big industrial countries in search of 
ways to stabilize exchange rates 
one method that baker has pushed since the tokyo economic summit 
in 1986 has been the use of a variety of economic indicators to 
monitor each countrys performance in helping to sustain worldwide 
growth this group of indicators includes individual growth rates 
inflation and trade balances 
bakers proposal would add gold and other commodity prices to 
the list of economic yardsticks the countries use to coordinate 
policies 
this approach would introduce a pricesensitive measure into the 
economic planning process in addition to gold other commodities 
which might be included are iron ore copper rubber cotton 
wheat rice corn coffee and tea 
if the price of these commodities rose in particular countries 
those nations would be encouraged to boost interest rates to fight 
inflation but if commodity prices were falling the countries 
would know they had room to cut interest rates and stimulate 
economic growth without danger of inflation 
some countries in particular west germany have opposed the 
commodity index because they see it as a device that would be used 
to goad them into achieving faster growth at the risk of sparking 
inflation 
but in a television interview monday baker said the seven top 
industrial countries were in basic agreement at present over the 
steps needed to stabilize exchange rates 
the major industrialized countries of the world obviously 
favor stability of exchange rates and we have been very pleased 
with the stability we have seen since our last meeting in 
december baker said on nbcs today program 
last dec 22 the seven countries pledged to support the dollar 
which at the time was under heavy selling pressure that commitment 
was backed up by massive intervention the process by which 
governments buy weak currencies such as the dollar to drive up the 
price

a decade of school reform has produced stacks of 
legislation higher teacher pay and tighter teaching requirements 
but has left unresolved whether teachers are fullfledged 
professionals a report says 
by sheer volume of legislation it is clear that teaching has 
been reformed said the 80page rand corp report the 
evolution of teacher policy released monday 
teaching policy is up for grabs and there are lots of people 
grabbing it said 
the net result of hundreds of educationrelated bills enacted 
during the past decade has been contradiction and confusion 
concluded the report by researchers linda darlinghammond and 
barnett barry 
school reform has yet to settle whether teachers are 
professionals possessing a body of knowledge and capable of dealing 
with the individual needs of students or whether they are merely 
semiskilled workers needing constant supervision the 
researchers said 
still the report found that average salaries rose 31 percent 
from 1981 to 1986 to 25240 and 19 states adopted minimum salary 
schedules more recent figures from the national education 
association estimate average salaries at 28000 this year 
starting salaries are also up but not enough to close the gap 
between teaching and other professions according to nea figures 
the average was 17500 in 1987 while beginning accountants 
chemists computer specialists and engineers for example all 
earned in excess of 20000 
overall the average teachers purchasing power is practically 
unchanged from 197172 levels according to the analysis 
nearly all states considered performancebased pay systems 
including merit pay from 1983 to 1986 but such programs often 
have encountered delays because of teacher opposition and lack of 
funds 
twentyseven states enacted tougher teacher training 
requirements including testing of academic ability and minimum 
gradepoint averages states are increasingly stressing liberal 
arts background over education courses 
paradoxically for a number of states improving teacher 
preparation seems to mean reducing the amount of time devoted to 
traditional teacher education the report said 
by 1986 46 states required teacher competency testing for 
admission to teacher education or certification or both but such 
testing has stalled in many states because of lack of funding or 
questions about the testss validity 
in a contradiction 46 states have cleared the way for 
substandard limited emergency certification twentyseven of those 
states issue certificates to people lacking even a bachelors 
degree to solve teacher shortages 
this practice undermines the tenet that only those who 
have mastered a specialized knowledge base will be admitted to 
practice the report said 
national education association president mary hatwood futrell 
called the rand report right on target 
bruce goldberg assistant director of educational issues for the 
american federation of teachers called the report obviously 
correct if teaching is to become a true profession then teachers 
will have to be granted the kind of autonomy required of any other 
profession 
the rand study is being published nearly five years after the 
reagan administration issued the report a nation at risk which 
blasted mediocrity in us schools 
while initial reform efforts aimed at boosting salaries and 
toughening teacher certification requirements a more recent wave 
of reforms has stressed freeing teachers from unnecessary 
regulations and boosting their status 
in effect reformers in the last two years have come to believe 
that there should be higher standards to enter teaching but fewer 
rules about what and how to teach 
this is in essence the bargain that all professions make 
with society the report said 
the next generation of teacher policy reform will need to 
focus on the content and nature of effective teaching its 
assessment and its deployment within schools to ensure that the 
longrange goals of the reformers are met the report concluded

americans are more willing than their 
representatives in congress to consider changes in the social 
security system but no single option for cutting costs has broad 
public support according to a survey 
the public also strongly favors pulling us troops out of 
europe as a way to reduce the federal budget deficit according to 
the survey by the league of concerned americans a charlotte 
ncbased nonprofit group 
the league commissioned the nationwide poll as part of a project 
called americas budget an effort to determine national 
spending priorities from a nonwashington perspective it planned 
to release a suggested budget today 
a lot of things that are perceptually true in washington 
are not that way across the country said scott rasmussen 
founder of the league 
for example an informal congressional survey showed 80 percent 
of the members favored leaving the social security system 
untouched only 34 percent favored that option in the nationwide 
poll 
however people differed over what changes should be made the 
poll showed 
from a list of options 21 percent favored making the system 
voluntary and 25 percent supported raising the retirement age to 
allow a drop in the social security tax only 6 percent favored 
cutting costofliving adjustments for retirees the most 
frequently mentioned option when washington considers cutbacks 
congress has been holding hearings this year on what lawmakers 
call burden sharing forcing us allies to take on more of 
the cost of defending against the soviet bloc 
the informal survey of congress showed only 12 percent said they 
would favor gradually withdrawing a substantial portion of us 
troops from western europe over the next 20 years however more 
than three out of four citizens polled supported the idea 
the poll was conducted for the league by marketwise inc the 
random sample of 519 respondents has a margin of error of 43 
percentage points 
despite the 1983 changes in the social security which included 
raising taxes to build up big surpluses over the next few years 
more than a fourth of the people polled still doubt whether their 
benefits will be there when they retire according to the survey 
i think there is a real temptation to spend the money if 
there are surpluses said rasmussen 
sen lawton chiles dfla chairman of the senate budget 
committee said monday he would propose a resolution to put 
congress on record opposing the current accounting system which 
allows social security surpluses to hide the true size of the 
governments operating deficit 
rasmussen a business entrepreneur who with his father founded 
the espn sports network in 1978 said he hoped the league would 
help prod the politicians to keep working toward a balanced budget 
the results were being presented to the new national commission on 
the deficit which will make recommendations for the next president 
and congress on ways to cut red ink he said

a new book offers some timely definitions in 
this season of taxes and politics including the observation that a 
frontrunner these days is someone who claims to be the 
underdog for fear of going the way of his predecessors 
or for example that the art of taxation has been defined as 
so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest amount of feathers 
with the least amount of hissing 
frontrunner is what all candidates want to be but dont want 
to be called says the recently published dorsey dictionary of 
american politics a product of chicagos dorsey press 
with 4000 entries the book compiled and written by jay m 
shafritz of the university of pittsburgh graduate school aims to 
capture in dictionary form the nuts and bolts of american 
constitutional government including the slang and stories of its 
199 years of existence it provides descriptions of government 
agencies court decisions people places things and states of 
mind 
a box charts the rise of the federal budget deficit from 28 
billion under president nixon in 1970 to 2207 billion under 
president reagan in 1986 
one entry recalls thomas jefferson asking george washington why 
the constitutional convention over which washington had presided 
had created a senate as well as a house 
why do you pour your coffee into your saucer washington is 
supposed to have asked jefferson 
to cool it jefferson replied 
even so concluded washington we pour legislation into 
the senatorial saucer to cool it 
flipping through the pages one finds that one possible origin 
of the word yankee to designate americans in general or new 
englanders in particular is from a corruption of jan kees an 
unkind dutch nickname meaning john cheese 
the dutch who first settled new york applied the name to the 
english who followed the dictionary says 
then there is stand pat 
it is described as a phrase originating in the game of poker 
that has been extended to mean one who accepts a present situation 
or stands by an existing policy 
nobody in american politics today is in favor of standing 
pat the dictionary maintains and adds 
there is a classic piece of film from the 1960 presidential 
campaign in which richard nixon with his wife pat seated behind 
him energetically tells an audience that we cant stand pat 
subsequently to mrs nixons presumed relief he changed that 
line to america cannot stand still 
as his term nears an end reagan is at times referred to as a 
lame duck 
the dictionary says the phrase originated in the early days of 
the london stock exchange which then operated out of exchange alley 
the dictionary a broker who went bankrupt would waddle out 
of the alley like a lame duck 
the expression has long since crossed the atlantic and expanded 
its meaning to any soontobeoutofoffice leader whose authority 
is consequently impaired 
most of the dictionarys topics involve serious subjects 
deregulation deterrence devaluation and dictators for example 
but it does have flashes of humor 
one such flash how to tell the difference between republicans 
and democrats 
the dictionary quotes from the anonymous wit whose musings were 
inserted in the congressional record some years ago by the late 
craig hosmer then a republican congressman from california 
to wit 
democrats buy most of the books that have been banned 
somewhere republicans form censorship committees and read them as 
a group 
democrats give their wornout clothes to those less fortunate 
republicans wear theirs

the united states western europe and other 
big grain producers should create a fund that would help develop 
farming in the third world french agriculture minister francois 
guillaume says 
guillaume says such a plan would help narrow the growing gap 
between rich and poor countries guillaume spoke monday at an open 
meeting with american officials and farm experts 
public opinion cannot understand that politicans in the 
developed countries are unable to put the grains stored in american 
and european silos into the stomachs of men and women in developing 
countries he said 
meanwhile both the united states and western europe are each 
spending about 30 billion a year to subsidize farmers he said 
during a news conference he described his proposal under which 
grain producers would fix a floor price for grain at a level that 
would not stimulate new production they would then contribute part 
of the difference between the floor price and actual selling prices 
to a fund that guillaume likened to the marshall plan which helped 
western europe recover from world war ii 
the fund would be used to improve farming in third world 
countries he estimated that it could furnish 18 billion to 4 
billion a year from exporters of grain amd could be increased by 
voluntary countributions from rich importers such as japan 
daniel g amstutz chief us negotiator for world farm issues 
came out strongly against any plan to set prices and limit 
production he said one reason it would not work is that all 
producers could not be included and those who did not join would 
increase their production 
the reagan administration has been pushing a plan to phase out 
by the end of the century all subsidies affecting world trade in 
farm products

the government on monday proposed a 
resumption of talks with rebels on details of a ceasefire plan 
after negotiations ended last week in disagreement over arms 
shipments 
the sandinista government suggested the technical discussions be 
resumed wednesday or thursday in managua the capital 
it also proposed that the rebels known as contras send an 
advance team to managua on tuesday to prepare for discussions 
sandinista and rebel political leaders are scheduled to hold on 
friday 
in washington contra spokesman bosco matamoros who is a member 
of the special negotiating commission released a statement late 
monday saying the technical talks should resume at noon on 
wednesday in the border village of sapoa 
the statement said the contras ranking political leaders would 
travel to managua on friday for negotiations based on progress at 
the sapoa talks there was no immediate response from the 
government 
matamoros statement said the contras would send an advance 
delegation to managua thursday to prepare for the political talks 
it said the contra representatives would include roberto ferrey 
secretary of the directorate of the contras umbrella nicaraguan 
resistance group and david stadhagen 
a preliminary peace plan signed march 23 in sapoa called for the 
two sides to hold technical discussions to work out details of a 
60day ceasefire that went into effect april 1 the talks between 
military commanders are to spell out how the contras are to gather 
in ceasefire zones 
during the truce the two sides are to hold negotiations leading 
to a permanent agreement to end more than six years of war between 
the usbacked contras and the government 
military leaders have held six days of technical talks since 
march 28 at sapoa 90 miles south of managua and beside the costa 
rican border 
they have agreed only on seven zones in which the contras are to 
gather but have failed to decide on security measures and how the 
rebels are to receive supplies in the zones 
the meetings ended friday after the contras asked for a recess 
of several days to discuss a 25point plan the government proposed 
the contras earlier offered a 34point plan 
last week the sandinistas suggested the technical talks be 
resumed friday when the political leaders are to hold their 
discussions 
paul reichler an american lawyer negotiating for the 
sandinistas said over the weekend that there were only two points 
of contention in the proposal presented by the contras 
the contra proposals would allow the rebels to receive arms 
ammunition and war materiel while in the zones it also would ban 
the sandinistas from receiving any military aid which is supplied 
by the soviet bloc 
reichler described those two points as absolutely 
unacceptable 
the original ceasefire plan would permit the contras to receive 
only food and basic supplies channeled through a neutral 
organization such as the international red cross 
political leaders of both sides had been scheduled to meet last 
wednesday in managua the rebels postponed them saying the 
technical talks had not advanced enough to move toward political 
issues 
the rebels also have said they will not participate in this 
weeks highlevel political talks unless they are free to meet with 
opposition leaders 
the government maintains that the peace agreement specifies 
contra representation in politics begins only after the rebels move 
into the ceasefire zones

vietnamese biologists reportedly have 
sighted a rare indochinese gray ox for the first time in nearly 20 
years raising hopes the endangered species can be saved from 
extinction 
a newspaper published monday by the world wildlife fund said the 
animal called a kouprey was seen last year by a vietnamese team 
in a densely forested area near the laotian border the sighting 
was revealed in january at an international conservation meeting in 
hanoi the fund said 
it was important because scientists had begun to fear the animal 
might be extinct at least in vietnam said elizabeth kemf who 
edits the newspaper 
experts are especially interested in the kouprey because it may 
be immune to rinderpest an often fatal infectious disease that 
afflicts cattle sheep and goats ms kemf told the associated 
press 
scientists want to study the possibility of crossbreeding 
kouprey with cattle to render them immune to the intestinal 
disease she said 
the kouprey is a migratory animal found chiefly in vietnam laos 
and cambodia and also in thailand

talks will extend at least to saturday and will focus on a variety 
of housekeeping details that must be settled before the two 
sides begin compliance inspections 
some of the topics on the plate include living quarters for 
inspectors call signs for aircraft traveling in each country the 
logistics of moving and putting in place the equipment well need 
and what equipment were planning to use and even how we deal with 
the news media said the source 
the united states and soviet union want to reach agreement on 
such details in advance of the senate vote on ratifying the new 
treaty to ensure a smooth start for the compliance inspections the 
official added

missiles in the two superpower arsenals with a range of roughly 300 
miles to 3500 miles be destroyed within three years

performing the same role inside the soviet union by visiting 
russian facilities and deployment sites

astronomers may have to change their ideas about 
the early universe because of the discovery of the oldest and most 
distant galaxy ever observed researchers said 
the galaxy about 10 times the size of the milky way was formed 
before the universe was a mere 2 billion years old said its 
discoverer simon lilly of the university of hawaii at manoa 
researchers have previously found indirect evidence of galaxies 
forming at extreme distances but this is the first clear 
observation of a mature galaxy at those distances lilly said 
monday in a telephone interview 
this pushes back the time at which galaxies formed in the 
early universe he said 
the discovery could force a revision in astronomers conception 
of the universe lilly said 
if we find more objects like this the colddarkmatter 
scenario will be in trouble he said 
that scenario says that most of the universe exists in the form 
of cold dark material that we cannot observe it also predicts 
that massive galaxies like the one discovered should not exist so 
early in the history of the universe lilly said 
in january richard elston and george and marcia rieke of the 
university of arizona reported the possible existence of even 
older more distant galaxies but those results are not yet 
confirmed george rieke said monday 
i would say he has claim to the most distant galaxy rieke 
said we have claim to having found candidates that may be even 
more distant but thats different from having it nailed down 
nevertheless rieke said the two lines of research mesh nicely 
because the existence of his galaxy implies that something like 
the galaxies that we have candidates for must exist 
harding smith a physicist at the university of california san 
diego who has studied distant galaxies said lilly has made a 
substantial jump and i do think its an important result 
it will help astronomers understand the processes that form 
galaxies smith said we dont understand when they form and how 
they form and both of these are very interesting questions because 
they may tell us more about what happened even earliier in the 
universe smith said 
a report of lillys work has been accepted for publication in 
the astrophysical journal he said 
to determine an objects distance and age astronomers observe 
the socalled redshift of light emitted by the object the higher 
the redshift the older and more distant the object 
lillys galaxy has a redshift of 34 he said the oldest and 
most distant galaxy observed before his had a redshift of 18 he 
said 
the arizona researchers are searching for evidence of new 
galaxies at redshifts of 6 to 25 rieke said 
the age of the universe cannot be precisely determined lilly 
said but the best estimates put it at between 10 billion and 20 
billion years 
if a figure of 15 billion years is arbitrarily chosen as a 
starting point then the redshift of lillys galaxy means the light 
that lilly observed left the galaxy when the universe was about 3 
billion years old 
observations of the galaxy itself indicate it was then 1 billion 
or 2 billion years old he said meaning it was formed when the 
universe was 1 billion to 2 billion years old 
lilly said his research involved identifying the source of a 
distant emission of radio waves that was recorded in 1981 
he used the canadafrancehawaii optical telescope and the 
united kingdom infrared telescope both located atop hawaiis 
mauna kea volcano to pick up light and infrared radiation from 
the precise point where the radio emission had been detected those 
observations allowed him to identify it as a mature galaxy

riding the jesse jackson press bus at times 
can be like attending a meeting of the united nations 
jackson has attracted intense interest by the international news 
media in part because of what one frenchman called his star 
quality news agencies from all over the world have sent writers 
and tv crews to cover his bid for the democratic presidential 
nomination 
the campaigns of the other candidates are so boring that jesse 
jackson is the only one to emerge said paris match correspondent 
oliver royant 
the foreign coverage is increasing in anticipation of the 
crucial new york primary on april 19 his aides say 
traveling with jacksons entourage last weekend were reporters 
from ecuador lebanon france japan great britain canada italy 
and west germany off and on the campaign also has seen 
representatives from news agencies of other nations including 
denmark and holland 
at one point campaign aides even considered having a news 
conference just for the foreign press because all wanted 
interviews with the candidate and their questions were of a 
different nature than those asked by us reporters said press 
secretary delmarie cobb 
the interest seems to center on jackson as a person and 
international celebrity his eloquence and flair and on the 
historical significance of his candidacy 
foreign reporters said they were looking for those kinds of 
stories more than at jacksons stance on issues 
cobb said the foreign press also asks a lot of questions about 
whether the united states is ready to elect a black president 
on the other hand raghida dergham of the londonbased lebanese 
magazine alhawadress said editors in the middle east are very 
interested in the foreign policies of jackson who enjoys 
considerable support in the arabamerican community 
british broadcasting corp correspondent kent barker said 
jackson was certainly the most interesting to foreign eyes hes 
the most colorful dramatic presidential candidate this year 
the bbcs audience is also interested in jacksons liberalism 
and sees him as aligned with the philosophies of the labor party in 
great britain he said 
in italy people are more aware of jackson than the other 
candidates even though rai television has done a profile on 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis said rai cameraman michele 
capasso he cited the style and excitement around him as 
reasons jackson makes a good story 
in france every us election people want to know two 
things said royant of paris match are we going to find a 
kennedy this year who is the star this year jesse jackson is 
the star 
paris match did a profile of jackson in october and royant is 
working on a second profile that will appear some time before the 
summer nominating conventions jackson has visited france in the 
past and is wellknown there said royant 
additionally there is interest in the candidacy of a black man 
20 years after the death of civil rights leader martin luther king 
royant said

the democratic presidential contenders are 
telling congress to disregard president reagans threat to veto a 
trade bill if it calls for mandatory advance layoff notices 
tennessee sen albert gore and jesse jackson sent letters over 
the weekend urging sen lloyd bentsen dtexas a key architect of 
the sweeping trade bill to resist further weakening of the 
laborsought notice provision 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis earlier had sent a similar 
letter to bentsen urging him to retain the notice provision 
regardless of the presidents intentions 
the letters arrived on capitol hill as gore jackson and dukakis 
are engaged in an intense competition for the 255 convention 
delegates at stake in the april 19 primary in new york a state 
where one in every three workers carries a union card 
i can only conclude that the real reason many companies oppose 
a notice requirement and the reason those same companies do not 
give advance notice now is that they do not care what happens to 
workers or their communities gore said in his letter 
jackson said his campaign speeches on the need for advance 
layoff notices have received enthusiastic responses and that it 
is difficult to believe that congress would not override such an 
illadvised veto 
the inclusion of the provision in the trade bill has been 
helpful in making working people aware that the congress is 
responding to some of their very fundamental concerns he said in 
his letter to bentsen 
the aflcio which has made the trade bill its top legislative 
priority for six years has threatened to withdraw its support for 
it entirely if the layoff notices are eliminated 
i could understand our socalled trading partners being 
opposed to the bill aflcio secretarytreasurer thomas r 
donahue said monday but hes reagan supposed to be the 
president of the united states 
under the provision companies with more than 100 employees 
would be required to give 60 days advance notice when they intend 
to close a plant or lay off onethird or more of its workforce 
however the layoffs would have to total at least 50 workers to 
trigger the mandatory notices 
bentsen and other senate and house superconferees are 
scheduled to start meeting today in hopes of getting a final 
version of the trade bill by thursday or friday for separate votes 
in each house on final passage 
without citing specific provisions reagan said in his weekend 
radio address saturday he still has very underline very 
serious reservations about the bill 
the bottom line is this i will veto a bad trade bill before i 
let a bad trade bill veto our economy 
while administration officials have outlined objections to 
several provisions congressional leaders describe most of the 
protests as padding for its vehement opposition to the 
mandatory layoff notices 
its a classic game of everybody trying to figure out what the 
other guys bottom line is said one legislative aide who 
acknowledged one purpose of the candidates letters is to counter 
administration veto threats 
just a week ago labor secretary ann mclaughlin wrote senate 
democratic leader robert byrd she would be forced to recommend 
that the president veto the bill if these protectionist 
mandatory plant closing and layoff requirements remain 
a labor department task force last year called advance notices 
an essential component of a readjustment program for helping 
laid off workers get new jobs but stopped short of saying the 
notices should be mandated 
according to the bureau of labor statistics two of every three 
workers laid off in the united states receive no advance notice 
the average notice according to a separate survey by the 
general accounting office is 14 days for whitecollar workers and 
seven days for bluecollar workers

glenn harringtons rhinoceros may be an 
unlikely cross between a bull and a buick but he says hell miss 
the lifesize metallic sculpture when it moves to a ripleys 
believe it or not museum 
the mountains are no place for an 8yearold rhinoceros 
harrington said its time he moved to a lower elevation and a 
warmer climate 
the rhino was made about eight years ago from old steel 
automobile bumpers by bumper sculpture artist jon bedford a 
former salida resident harrington bought it for display in front 
of his hardware business on us 50 
when the business closed a year ago the rhino moved to the 
front lawn of harringtons home 
we felt it didnt belong in a private yard harrington said 
it should be in a public place where people can see and 
appreciate it 
so harrington put the rhino up for sale advertising it at a 
gallery in taos nm where bedford now works last week word 
came that the rhino was sold to ripleys believe it or not museum 
in laguna beach calif 
still harrington says hell miss the old beast 
the rhino brought a lot of interesting comments and situations 
when we were at the store he said there was the old rancher 
from saguache for example he showed up one morning just as i was 
opening the store and he stood outside for a long time studying 
that rhinoceros 
when he finally came in he said i know where that came 
from its a cross between a brahma bull and a buick

a university of massachusetts student 
judiciary board agreed monday to settle a dispute over a 
communists election as copresident of the student body 
the threemember student supreme court heard a motion monday 
night that would declare the election invalid john sanchez the 
panels chief judge said a ruling on the motion would be issued 
wednesday prior to a scheduled meeting of the undergraduate student 
senate 
jason rabinowitz a member of the young communist league and 
his cocandidate noncommunist shari silkoff were elected march 
15 rabinowitz is believed to be the first ycl member elected 
campus president since the group was formed five years ago 
student attorney general william collins filed the motion asking 
the judiciary board to declare the rabinowitzsilkoff ticket 
invalid because the student government constitution allows only one 
person to hold the office of president 
i think im winning collins said after the session but 
the point is i cant just win i have to win convincingly 
monday nights hearing was mostly spent on arguments by a 
student lawyer representing rabinowitz and silkoff who attempted 
to show that the writers of the student constitution did not mean 
to prevent more than one person from serving 
conservatives on the 90member undergraduate student senate 
filibustered last week to keep the election from being ratified and 
stop rabinowitz and silkoff from taking office 
collins said his motion had nothing to do with the candidates 
political beliefs but rabinowitz contended otherwise 
hes more interested in petty factional politics than the 
wellbeing of the whole student government said rabinowitz a 
20yearold junior from new york city 
rabinowitz and silkoff also 20 won 1454 votes 391 more than 
conservative candidate aram hamparian at the 19000student campus

the investment banking firm shearson lehman 
hutton inc came under attack during a congressional hearing for 
what one senator said was its role as a corporate raider in a 
hostile takeover 
in effect what we have is a bank acting as a corporate 
raider sen jim sasser dtenn said monday at a hearing of the 
senate banking committee the committee met for three hours on the 
attempted takeover of pittsburghbased koppers by beazer plc of 
britain which is being advised by shearson lehman 
shearson is only the first to cross a line that wall street 
believes will be obliterated by others racing across it in the 
future said sen john heinz rpa referring to the distinction 
between banking and commerce 
steven b wolitzer managing director of shearson said the 
firms role was limited to providing shortterm or bridge 
financing for beazers tender offer and giving advice such 
financing is typical for investment banks in deals of this 
kind he said 
wolitzer acknowledged that shearson is contributing equity of 
its own 23 million to the bidding group but he said 
management and control of the group would be held by beazer plc 
but charles r pullin chairman and chief executive officer of 
koppers said shearson has dominated and actively guided every 
aspect of the planning and execution of the koppers takeover 
attempt since its secret initiation one year ago 
brian c beazer chairman and chief executive officer of the 
british company defended the takeover attempt saying his 
companys goal is not to make a quick buck by laying off 
employees and selling the companys operations piecemeal 
i am not a corporate raider beazer said he said koppers 
management has mounted a massive campaign of disinformation 
about his bid 
beazer led a group that made an unsolicited cash tender offer of 
45 a share for koppers on march 3 a deal that has since been 
sweetened to 60 per share or 17 billion koppers produces 
construction materials and chemicals 
from an american express co viewpoint not only do we think 
this to be a shearson transaction and activity in the normal course 
of its business but we also view the uproar by some allies of 
koppers as illinformed provocative and illadvised said harry 
l freeman executive vice president of american express 
shearsons parent 
he said it was illinformed because of the continued erroneous 
assertion that somehow shearson rather than beazer is trying to 
acquire koppers which is simply not true and strikes the 
management of american express co as a bizarre allegation 
beazers offer has been extended until april 15 while courts 
consider legal challenges by koppers that have slowed the takeover 
bid

the man who originally awarded kiviat his medals will present the

democrat michael dukakis celebrated his cousins 
academy award and with his eye on new yorks important 
presidential primary said i hope its an omen for next week 
dukakis talked to cousin olympia dukakis by telephone monday 
night shortly after she won an oscar for her supporting role in the 
movie moonstruck 
the massachusetts governor made his call from a greenwich 
village restaurant that figured in the movie and was decorated with 
photos and posters from it dining on pasta and lamb chops dukakis 
watched a videotaped replay of his cousins award and clapped when 
she waved her statuette and said ok michael lets go 
he had just seen the movie the night before 
youre fantastic youre unbelievable he gushed on the 
telephone youre radiant im so happy for you 
what are we doing here you and i just a couple of street 
kids he asked 
dukakis the frontrunner for the democratic nomination had 
been saying all afternoon as he campaigned around new york city 
that an oscar victory could be a harbinger for his presidential 
candidacy in next tuesdays primary 
i hope its an omen for next week he said i hope its a 
good sign for the dukaki all of them 
earlier in the day dukakis bid for jewish support and sided 
with israel in blaming arab leaders for violence in the west bank 
he found no fault with israels policies or use of force in dealing 
with palestinian uprisings but he also absolved the young arab 
protesters saying they have been misled by their leaders 
it is critically important that the world understand who is 
responsible for the turmoil and the violence he told the 
conference of presidents of major american jewish organizations 
it is not the generation of young palestinians who have grown 
up in uncertainty he said it is not a government in jerusalem 
that struggles to maintain order it is regrettably arab 
leaders themselves who have time and again rejected the chance to 
sit down with israel and negotiate a permanent peace in the middle 
east 
dukakis appearance before the group of leaders from 44 major 
national jewish organizations was an effort to attract support from 
jews who make up some onequarter of the democratic primary 
electorate in new york where the states huge delegate prize is at 
stake next tuesday 
rival albert gore jr appeared before the group earlier drawing 
a distinction with dukakis in opposing a letter signed by 30 
senators urging secretary of state george shultz to press israel to 
come to a peaceful resolution of the west bank and gaza violence 
leaders of the group said democrat jesse jackson who has drawn 
opposition from some jews for his 1984 reference to new york as 
hymietown declined an invitation 
dukakis faced questions that appeared to challenge him to go 
further in drawing distinctions between himself and jackson 
including one questioner who called jackson an antisemite 
others pressed him to state opposition to creation of an 
independent palestinian state which dukakis refused to do saying 
that was a matter for israel and its neighbors to negotiate 
he was also asked to state a position on the future of 
jerusalem dukakis initially said jerusalem too was subject to 
negotiation he later told reporters however that im for a 
united jerusalem under israeli control 
always have been he said 
he said jerusalem will remain the capital and should remain 
the capital of israel 
dukakis refused to be drawn into a personal characterization of 
jackson on the jewish issue but he cited several differences with 
jackson such as jacksons call for returning corporate taxes to 
1980 levels and in general on the middle east 
dukakis also spoke to a large gathering of supporters at an 
evening rally on staten island 
he urged them to ignore polls showing him ahead saying he lost 
his 1978 reelection bid despite a lead of as much as 50 points in 
polls ive learned from that experience he said

transporting stolen historic documents including letters from 
abraham lincoln and winston churchill 
charles merrill mount a brooklyn native who affects the accent 
and manners of a british gentleman says he will appeal mondays 
conviction for transporting goods belonging to the national 
archives and library of congress 
this was not a trial it was only a hearing of government 
allegations said mount a trial is when both sides present 
their case it did not happen here the government wanted a 
conviction and they got a conviction 
the 59yearold historian and author faces up to 10 years in 
prison and a 500000 fine when he is sentenced in us district 
court he was released on 50000 bail pending sentencing may 23 
charles mcginty mounts public defender said he will appeal on 
grounds that the court should have paid transportation costs for 
two irish men mount wanted as defense witnesses mount whose 
18400 in savings was seized by the government following the 
arrest claimed his status as indigent required prosecutors to pay 
to bring witnesses to boston 
at issue were 166 documents including letters by lincoln 
churchill artist james mcneill whistler and author henry james 
that allegedly belonged to the library of congress but were sold by 
mount to goodspeeds book shop in boston for about 20000 in july 
mount a respected art historian and former guggenheim 
foundation fellow said he owned the documents for years and 
showed some of them to the two irish men including the president 
of a national art academy in the 1960s in dublin 
the government said mount gained access to the documents last 
may and july goodspeeds officials had contacted the fbi after the 
first transaction with mount 
only one witness appeared for the defense during the threeweek 
trial a nebraska woman who met mount in a hotel in ireland in 1961 
and said she saw some documents she paid her fare to boston 
the jury deliberated four hours friday and met for 2 hours 
monday before returning the verdict 
mount also was indicted on possession of federal property 
charges by a grand jury in washington frank l mcnamara jr us 
attorney in boston said he did not know if federal prosecutors 
would pursue those possession charges 
claire rochefort a manuscript director at goodspeeds who 
purchased the documents from mount is pleased the documents may 
return to the national archives 
they are part of our national heritage said rochefort we 
would like to be reimbursed but to get the documents back is the 
most important thing 
mount who changed his name from stanley merrill suchow in the 
1950s said he will return to his room in a washington boarding

the air force says its decision against 
closing or consolidating 37 rotc units across the country also will 
mean a delay in its efforts to save more than 10 million a year on 
that program 
in a letter to sen lloyd bentsen dtexas the air force said 
that while the decision will delay anticipated savings the air 
force secretary is sensitive to the impact of the prior decision 
for closureconsolidation 
the decision to cut the programs would be reviewed again at the 
end of the spring term of 1990 but plans would go forward to 
reduce the number of afrotc commissioned officers by 15 percent 
over the next two years according to the letter from lt col 
timothy l titus a legislative liaison officer 
bentsen chairman of the finance committee wrote in january to 
air force secretary edward c aldridge jr to complain the closures 
would have a disproportionate impact on texas a state with a 
long and proud tradition of military service which has also 
welcomed military activities 
texas and north carolina stood to lose more rotc units than any 
other states if the air force had gone through with its plans 
announced in january to close 30 of its 151 rotc units and 
consolidate another seven with nearby schools both states would 
have lost four programs each 
the air force said in a letter monday to bentsen that the move 
would have cut 200 positions and saved more than 10 million 
annually the armed services are searching for 329 billion of 
spending cuts in fiscal 1989 which begins oct 1 to comply with 
budget limits established in november in a deficitreduction plan 
without a steady inflow of bright energetic younger officers 
particularly from the afrotc units the air force may lose some 
of its vigor and diversity bentsen said in his letter 
the air force had planned to phase in the closures over 18 
months to allow 1197 juniors and seniors in the 37 affected 
programs to complete their studies the affected units where young 
officers are groomed for active service have a current fouryear 
enrollment of 4448 
lt col jan dalby an air force spokesman said the air force 
withdrew its plans after determining the criteria to identify units 
targeted for closure or consolidation had not been spelled out to 
the schools involved 
they did not know the criteria they would be judged by 
dalby said the decision was unfair without knowing how they were 
being looked at the issue we dealt with was primarily fairness 
we believe a twoyear postponement of our efforts to close or 
consolidate afrotc units will provide sufficient notice to affected 
units as well as their host colleges and universities 
the air force released a statement saying that although many of 
the afrotc programs marked for closure were performing well under 
afrotc standards they were identified as being the least 
costeffective afrotc programs under new criteria developed for the 
closure plan

the senate is moving toward approval of a 11 
trillion federal budget for fiscal 1989 that some lawmakers say 
does more to mask the size of the governments enormous deficit 
than it does to slash it 
senate leaders predicted that despite those reservations the 
chamber could approve the spending plan as early as today the 
proposal which has received rare bipartisan support cleared its 
first procedural hurdle monday when senators voted 830 to begin 
debating the budget resolution 
the fiscal 1989 blueprint estimates a deficit of 136 billion 
precisely the target set by the grammrudman balanced budget law 
for the next fiscal year which begins oct 1 this years deficit 
is expected to reach 1467 billion 
but helping to keep the red ink down is a 46 billion surplus 
the social security system is expected to amass next year even 
though that money is being built up in anticipation of retirements 
by the baby boomers in the early 21st century and cannot be used 
for anything else the annual surpluses were included in the 
budgets arithmetic and make the deficit look smaller 
in addition the senate like the house relied on an optimistic 
administration economic forecast to arrive at its projected 
deficit had the lawmakers used the less cheerful projections of 
their own congressional budget office the red ink would have been 
35 billion higher 
we need to quit fooling ourselves in talking about a 136 
billion deficit sen lawton chiles chairman of the budget 
committee said during debate its just not correct 
chiles dfla planned to introduce an amendment that would 
urge congress to stop using social security surpluses in 
calculating the deficit 
other amendments were anticipated to shift money among several 
domestic programs 
but the main fights that normally dominate budget debates how 
to balance domestic and military spending and whether to raise 
taxes are not present this year those questions were settled 
last fall when president reagan and congressional leaders reached 
their socalled budget summit agreement 
the senate budget resolution obeys the summit agreements limits 
in calling for 294 billion in military spending next year 161 
billion for foreign assistance and 1692 billion for domestic 
programs in which spending is not set by automatic formulas 
in addition there will be no new taxes beyond the 14 billion 
called for in the summit and already enacted into law 
i dont think we can afford this year to breach the summit 
agreement said sen pete v domenici of new mexico ranking 
republican on the budget panel i think we ought to enforce it 
and i think weve done that rather well 
with the major fights out of the way the house passed its 
version of the budget resolution march 23 on a bipartisan 319102 
vote 
in that chamber as in the senate lawmakers have some 
significant differences with the domestic priorities reagan set in 
the budget he submitted to congress in february the senate 
proposal does not eliminate or severely slash a series of federal 
mass transit and economic development programs as reagan wanted 
it also calls for about 1 billion more than reagan did for 
medicare 
but in line with reagan recommendations it would increase 
spending for aids research education space science and drug 
enforcement 
the budget resolution does not require the presidents 
signature but the two chambers must agree on an identical version 
before it takes effect the document will be used later as a 
blueprint by congress when it passes bills that actually provide 
the money for federal agencies

no one should feel bad about my going im not 
worth it begins one of the 1200 suicide notes collected by a 
canadian psychologist who will be honored this week for his 
pioneering study of fatal last words 
the note was left by a middleaged los angeles man who shot 
himself after an unhappy love affair said dr antoons leenaars 
37 of windsor ontario 
collected from coroners offices and bereaved loved ones the 
notes provide the raw material the dutchborn psychotherapist is 
analyzing to determine why people take their own lives and how they 
might be saved 
were looking for the common factors so that we can predict 
suicide attempts and intervene in those cases where the person 
might want us to intervene he said in an interview a long 
time ago i learned that you can help some and not others 
on friday leenaars will become only the second nonamerican to 
receive the edwin shneidman award established by a former ucla 
professor to encourage research into suicide the award will be 
presented at a convention of the american association of 
suicidology in washington dc 
eight out of 10 people contemplate suicide but only those who 
cannot bear the pain go through with it leenaars said about 15 
percent leave a note the ultimate personal document 
with the help of a computer leenaars has identified eight 
classifications of suicides based on what people write in their 
notes they range from tunnel vision to paranoia failed 
interpersonal relations and explosive anger turned on themselves 
some hurt so bad they just want to stop consciousness while 
others use suicide to express a bewildering ambivalence about life 
not only do they hate and love someone but they want to live 
and not live 
the common stimulus in all suicides is unbearable 
psychological pain said leenaars who works with school boards 
and public groups on suicide prevention and has written a book 
suicide notes scheduled for august publication 
leenaars said a note left by a 75yearold woman in los angeles 
made him cry before death by suffocation she wrote martha im 
heartsick first grandma then bill then my home my car my 
eyesight now my apartment love mary thanks for everything to 
everyone 
a 13yearold boy disappointed in love left this note before 
ending his life i know what im doing annette i found out ask 
carol i love you all bill 
an 18yearold married man shot himself and told those left 
behind life isnt worth the bother 
one note said no one is to blame ps happy fathers day 
another man unable to control his obsessive perfectionism 
killed himself because his ferrari got scratched leenaars said 
the doctor believes suicides are underreported since many 
coroners require a note before making that ruling even so 
official rates in north america tripled in the third quarter of 
this century with the highest toll in the 18 to 25 age bracket 
in 1981 there were 129 suicides in canada and 127 in the

in 1960 in the 1959 awards the musical gigi also swept nine 
oscars out of nine nominations 
it was a night of few surprises but some awkwardness with the 
shadow of a strike by movie and tv writers falling heavily on the 
proceedings there were numerous references some joking some 
serious to the labor dispute and on several occasions performers 
appeared to stumble over their remarks

the move from the music center to the shrine meant far more 
limousines than usual pulling up before the six 24foot oscars 
guarding the auditorium entrance 
last year at the music center we had 3000 people said 
samuel goldwyn jr producer of the oscar show for the second year 
this year we have 6000 
but apparently there wasnt enough room for the oscarcast 
orcestra at the cavernous shrine the musicians were housed on a 
sound stage five miles away in hollywood and would offer their 
live fanfares and movie themes via phone lines to giant 
speakers in the auditorium 
producer goldwyn faced a special problem this year the strike 
by the writers guild of america against the motion picture and 
television producers much of the script had been written before 
the strike was called but the guild refused to grant a waiver for 
the work to be completed the guild had also warned that 
nonmembers who write for the show might face rejection if they 
ever wanted to join the wga 
the 60th awards marked a first in press coverage the ussr 
was represented photographer nikolai gnisyuk of the soviet screen 
magazine circulation 2 million was accredited to join the mass 
of media backstage 
we journalists and photographers in the soviet union are 
amazed that such a fuss is made over these awards said gnisyuk 
before the ceremonies that is we understand the importance of 
the awards to the industry but all this mania is just incredible 
its as if someone were running for national election 
one major award was already known billy wilder for the irving 
g thalberg award for consistent quality of production wilder has 
already received six oscars for his work as writer director and 
producer his films including the lost weekend sunset 
boulevard some like it hot and the apartment 
unlike alfred hitchcock john ford and other filmmakers with 
distinctive styles wilders films dont easily fit a pattern 
im just a storyteller wilder once remarked technique is 
secondary to me

applauded and cher was hugged by olympia dukakis who won the best

in 1983s silkwood answered from the audience by blowing 
kisses

im on my way cher said in closing she had been nominated in a 
supporting role for silkwood but did not win

gov carroll campbell southern chairman 
for vice president george bushs presidential campaign is likely 
to play a highly visible role at the republican national 
convention according to a published report 
a member of campbells administration said during the weekend 
that campbell is likely to either nominate bush or make one of the 
three seconding speeches the greenville news said in mondays 
editions 
its going to be one of those said the administration 
official who asked not to be identified 
lee atwater bushs national campaign chairman and campbells 
former campaign manager said he didnt want to discuss the 
republican governors specific role at the national convention in 
new orleans aug 1518 but hell have one atwater told the 
newspaper 
campbell who is both personally and politically close to bush 
also is considered a longshot vice presidential possibility but 
campbell has said he doesnt believe he will be chosen 
making a nominating or seconding speech would enhance the 
prestige of the governor who is expected to run for reelection 
beginning in 1990 and is widely perceived as having senate 
aspirations the news said 
bush has all but locked up the gop nomination with only pat 
robertson retaining some delegate commitments and an organization 
mainly to influence platform and party direction and to build for a 
1992 presidential campaign

a community activist who founded a city youth 
center and has been a foster parent to 21 children was charged with 
sexually assaulting two teenage boys in his care authorities said 
a grand jury on monday indicted the rev paul j hall 41 of 
suburban south holland on 16 counts of criminal sexual assault and 
eight counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse 
hall surrendered late monday and was released after posting 10 
percent of a 25000 bond said south holland police spokeswoman 
georgianna musket 
he will plead innocent to the charges said his attorney brent 
stratton 
hall a nondenominational clergyman attracted widespread 
attention through food giveaways and other community programs run 
out of a storefront headquarters on chicagos south side since 
beginning the giveaways in 1980 he has kept a 25day fast each 
christmas 
the assaults on the two boys now ages 15 and 16 occurred from 
mid1986 through last fall when hall was a foster parent to six 
children at his home said cook county states attorney richard m 
daley 
the evidence clearly shows that the reverend hall betrayed the 
trust of these two children daley said 
in january south holland police chief dennis smits said hall 
had called chicago police to report that a 15yearold foster child 
had run away 
the teenager found at ohare international airport made 
allegations of abuse smits said the six children living with hall 
were removed from his supervision 
hall has been a foster parent for the state department of 
children and family services since 1979 and has cared for 21 foster 
children said department spokeswoman jo warfield 
the agency had received no complaints about hall before said 
robert moore chief of internal investigations for the agency 
how did he slip through the cracks if we knew that we could 
solve the problem said moore you cant just stop every act 
we continue to look at and review what went wrong and hope we can 
close up that crack 
hall founded the paul hall boys club in the 1960s he later 
branched out into other youthoriented programs such as a 24hour 
hotline for gang members seeking to go straight 
hall also established dropoff centers for gang members who 
wanted to turn in weapons 
daley said the charges are not connected to halls youth center 
which admits girls and boys the club is not associated with the 
boys amp girls club of chicago or its national affiliate the boys 
clubs of america 
daley said allegations concerning other children in halls care 
are being investigated ms warfield said her agency is taking 
steps to lift halls license to be a foster parent 
hall is to be arraigned may 2 if convicted of all the charges 
he could be sentenced to 296 years in prison

a draft letter on women written by us roman 
catholic bishops suggests that the church be more responsive toward 
the large numbers of catholic women who practice artificial 
contraception despite a church ban 
the letter released monday reasserted church teachings that 
birth control by artificial means is wrong but it also said it 
is essential that we foster a dialogue between those who find 
prohibitions against artificial contraception unacceptable and 
those who find that the natural regulation of births has enriched 
and preserved their marriage 
the 164page letter breaks little new ground on womens role in 
the church but does condemn sexism and urges priests to be more 
sensitive to womens concerns 
the document recommended that women play more of a leadership 
role in the church and suggests further study of the possibility of 
installing women as permanent deacons 
it also said girls should be allowed to join altar boys in 
assisting priests saying that exclusion of girls seems to stand 
in contradiction to our call for womens more direct involvement in 
the life of the church 
however the bishops stopped short of recommending that women be 
ordained as priests 
on birth control the draft acknowledged that there is a wide 
gap between what the church teaches about artificial contraception 
and the actual practice of many catholic women 
consulting with women on matters pertaining to birth control 
will contribute to church teaching on sexuality the draft said 
womens experience will lead to the formulation of better 
policies and preparation for family planning that can be more 
widely communicated to engaged and married couples 
we especially encourage a spirit of compassion towards those 
who in good conscience who have not lived in accord with the ideals 
set forth by the church 
the draft of the pastoral letter titled partners in the 
mystery of redemption a pastoral response to womens concerns for 
church and society will be circulated among catholics in the 
united states with responses due dec 1 
a final draft is expected to be presented to the full body of 
us bishops in november 1989 and if approved would become part 
of catholic teachings the draft was issued more than five years 
after church authorities began a study of women in the church 
mary brabeck associate professor of educational psychology at 
boston college who helped prepare the draft letter said she 
thought the significance of the document was that women are being 
listened to their experiences are being listened to 
sister sara butler of the missionary servants of the most 
blessed trinity in philadelphia said that the letter was 
definitely trying to address male attitudes and particularly 
male clerical attitudes 
the pastoral letter in fact chastises some priests and 
counselors in the church who fail to show understanding for 
divorced women 
some of us as well as priests religious and laity need to 
overcome the fear or prejudice that causes them to shun those whose 
marriages have led to divorce or ended in annulment the letter 
said 
at another point the letter said a frequently voiced concern 
is that those to whom women turn for help do not have the training 
sensitivity or experience necessary to address concretely what it 
is like to be a mother pursue a career seek just wages and be 
vigilant in regard to sexual violence

i must say this is certainly an imperial evening for me 
bertolucci thanked china for allowing him to shoot there the 
director amazed the film industry by winning permission to shoot a 
movie with political overtones in china and to take cameras into 
the fabled forbidden city the shrine of chinese history 
the logistics of the films production included actors from six 
nations and 19000 extras who played the soldiers of the peoples 
liberation army

being for last tango in paris in 1973 he also received a 
writing nomination for his screenplay of the conformist in 1971

everything changed immediately he said 
asked backstage about the lack of acting nominations for the 
picture bertolucci said this is a democratic election so what

the first state law in the nation to ban 
the sale of cheap handguns known as saturday night specials cleared 
the general assembly and was sent to the governor who has promised 
to sign it 
despite a fierce lobbying effort by the national rifle 
association the bill was passed monday night with support from top 
state officials and sarah brady wife of james brady president 
reagans press secretary 
mrs brady told legislators at an earlier hearing that a 29 
handgun that would be banned under the maryland law was used by 
john hinckley in his 1981 assassination attempt that wounded the 
president and left husband partially disabled 
democratic house speaker r clayton mitchell said the 9541 vote 
in the house of delegates a few hours before the 1988 legislative 
session ended seems to be a first a giant step forward 
im hoping congress will look at what maryland did said 
attorney general j joseph curranthats where this action is 
needed 
its been a long time but unfortunately it seems like as the 
list of victims grows it becomes easier to pass gun control 
legislation he said 
gov william donald schaefer who helped move the bill through 
the legislature said he will sign it into law unless he finds some 
unexpected legal flaws 
nra lobbyists gave up their fight after watching the bill sail 
through the senate on a 3510 vote saturday but charles h 
cunningham state liaison for the association said he will be back 
to renew the fight next year 
i just hope its not a trendsetting thing where a lot of 
states start setting up boards cunningham said after the senate 
vote 
the bill directs the governor to create a state handgun roster 
board headed by the state police superintendent the ninemember 
board will prepare a list of guns that can be sold in maryland and 
will be required to withhold approval of 
guns that are inaccurate poorly made easily concealed and 
manufactured of cheap materials characteristics common to the 
saturday night specials said to be used by drug pushers and other 
smalltime criminals 
guns made mostly of plastic or ceramic materials that cant be 
readily detected by security systems at airports and public 
buildings 
guns in which the manufacturers serial number has been 
obliterated or altered 
the bill prohibits manufacturers dealers and private 
individuals from selling any guns not on the list and provides 
fines from 2500 to 10000 for violations it will only be 
illegal to sell the weapons not to own them 
we shifted the burden of proof we put the onus on gun 
merchants to justify their guns said state sen howard denis 
republican 
four states illinois hawaii south carolina and minnesota 
have laws that ban guns based on the melting point of the metal 
according to the lobbying group handgun control inc guns with 
lower melting points are of poorer quality and thus cheaper 
however both the nra and handgun control agreed that no state 
has a law regulating guns on the basis of inaccuracy ease of 
concealment plastic or ceramic construction or the other 
characteristics addressed by the maryland law 
clearly this is going to add some impetus to other states 
considering gun control laws this is an example well be taking to 
other states said michael beard executive director of the 
national coalition to ban handguns 
the ban on sale of saturday night specials wont take effect 
until jan 1 1990 the board will be required to prepare a list of 
approved guns by july 1 1989

here is the conclusion of the draft pastoral 
letter on women issued monday by us roman catholic bishops 
 
i give you a new commandment love one another as i have loved

today is a time of challenge and change for men and women each 
day more barriers to the full recognition of their equality before 
god fall more stereotypes crumble more doors open 
women value the churchs recognition that they are a vital force 
in the world they embrace the expanded roles open to them since 
vatican council ii they bring knowledge education skills and 
leadership to both society and the church 
for catholic women the church is home it is through the church 
that they worship god serve others and seek guidelines for how to 
live in society in keeping with the full dignity of their calling 
to be persons and partners to be the people of god in an unjust 
and imperfect world 
like mary women refuse to lose courage they will not give up 
hope they believe in the basic thrust of our heritage which holds 
that we are to preserve the unity of the spirit through the bond 
of peace one body and one spirit one lord one faith one 
baptism one god and father of all who is over all and through all 
and in all eph 435

to be faithful to our heritage scripturally and doctrinally 
means to respect the dignity of each human person male and female 
to follow jesus means to be committed to living out just 
relationships in the church and in the world to become the kind of 
church god invites us to be means to work in solidarity with the 
poor the rich the sinners with persons of distinction 
the mystery of partnership in the church is manifest in our 
baptismal call to faith and holiness as part of the little flock of 
christ cf lk 1232 to live in christ is the invitation all 
receive cf gal 328 to belong to christ is the central reality 
in life cf ph 3714 to refuse this vocation as coming from 
god is the most obstinate sin cf gn 3 
the call to partnership in the church is thus fundamental to our 
entire heritage we believe therefore that the cooperative 
mutuality of women and men by virtue of their baptism will more and 
more become a reality as our understanding of the grace and 
benefits of partnership grows only then can we be freed from the 
attitudes of fear anger and violence that divide and destrroy the 
christian community where all are challenged to abide in love cf

mary stands as a model for all christians of what it means to be 
a partner with god in the work of salvation in gods plan marys 
free consent was involved in accomplishing the mystery of the 
incarnation when mary said yes the word was made flesh by the 
power of gods spirit 
in her response of faith mary is the perfect model of a 
disciple who builds up the earthly and temporal city while being 
a diligent pilgrim towards the heavenly and eternal city the 
disciple who works for that justice which sets free the oppressed 
and for that charity which assists the needy women and men 
alike are called to emulate mary to imitate her charity and spirit 
of service like her all are called to hear the word of god and 
act on it lk 1128 
over and above this mary is a special symbol for women for 
only a woman was gods partner in the incarnation god entrusted 
himself to the free and active ministry of a woman giving to 
mary the word incarnate

pope john paul ii in his encyclical redemptoris mater affirms 
that women by looking at mary find in her the secret of living 
their feminity with dignity and of achieving their own true 
advancement 
mary keeps before the church the virtues women are known for 
the selfoffering totality of love the strength that is capable 
of bearing the greatest sorrows limitless fidelity and tireless 
devotion to work the ability to combine penetrating intuition with 
words of support and encouragement 
in our times there is a desire on the part of many to revise 
devotional representations that appear to propose mary as a 
paradigm of passivity and submission to male authority a woman 
valued chiefly for her virginity and maternity a woman confined to 
domestic and familial roles 
similarly some lament the fact that mary has often been 
presented as so uniquely exalted and gifted because of her 
privileges of grace that she is beyond emulation such images do 
not reflect the gains women have made in terms of equality and 
coresponsibility 
in the face of these concerns we are reminded by the church 
that mary is a woman whose decision led to an event of world 
importance a woman of courage who fearlessly entered into gods 
plan and who followed her son to the cross a woman who did not 
hesitate to challenge injustice announcing the downfall of the 
powerful and the vindication of the oppressed 
contemporary portraits celebrate marys bond with ordinary women 
and reflect on her condition as wife mother widow as refugee and 
displaced person as woman of an oppressed people as mother of a 
prisoner and victim of persecution mary is thus not only a model 
to emulate but an active presence in the life of the church 
as the first disciple a woman who entered into partnership with 
god in the fullest sense mary is a sign of hope to all who seek 
reconciliation with god and with one another

women not only continue to carry the bulk of everyday work in 
the parish they are also renewing the churchs traditions of 
feminine spirituality as a source of inspiration and growth women 
of scripture and recognized saints are important in their personal 
and spiritual renewal 
inspiration comes from myriad unnamed women ministering in 
homes parishes and communities engaged in numerous charitable 
works living contemplatively loving god and listening obediently 
to the promptings of the spirit 
women who love and serve the church call the church in turn to 
be more responsive to their requests to be involved to a much 
greater degree in the decisions that most affect their lives in the 
ecclesial community 
while we affirm that the church is neither a democracy nor a 
political organization we urge that every effort be made to 
implement legislation that encourages such involvement to appoint 
more women in administrative positions and in general to create an 
atmosphere in the church that welcomes womens gifts at every level 
of participation 
with this kind of cooperation the church will certainly go 
forward in its mission to enable women and men to be partners in 
the mystery of redemption

having written these words we must see to it that the church 
on the national diocesan and parochial level enables this letter 
to come to life the dialogue between women and men must continue 
to be expanded so that our recommendations become part of the 
living heritage of our catholic people and our institutions 
implementation is essential for ours must not be a counterfeit 
love of formal politeness impersonal tolerance or empty words 
like christ we must listen first to the will of god speaking in 
the deepest recesses of our hearts 
thus having heard the word we must respond with imagination and 
courage to eradicate the injustice which keeps us from the full 
stature of christ we see in this pastoral response only a 
beginning a reminder of ideals a contact with experience and 
reality yielding throughtful reflections and calls for action 
together we wait expectantly in hope for a tomorrow in which 
love will truly prevail in which with mary we can confidently 
pray from our hearts 
my soul proclaims the greatness of the lord 
my spirit rejoices in god my savior 
for you lord have looked with favor on your lowly servant 
from this day all generations will call me blessed 
you the almighty have done great things for me 
and holy is your name 
you have mercy on those who fear you 
from generation to generation 
you have shown strength with your arm 
and scattered the proud in their conceit 
casting down the mighty from their thrones 
and lifting up the lowly 
you have filled the hungry with good things 
and sent the rich away empty 
you have come to the aid of your servant israel 
to remember the promise of mercy 
the promise made to our forebears 
to abraham and his children for ever

its amazing that despite a writers strike 
the academy awards could still be so gaseous and wordy 
everybody talked nonstop during monday nights 60th annual 
oscars ceremony on abc the host the presenters and especially 
the winners 
there were frequent references to the strike by the writers 
guild of america and to the fact that some people had no scripts 
it didnt slow anyone down however the winners seemed to have 
carte blanche to blab on until there was no one left to thank 
even master storyteller billy wilder in accepting the irving 
thalberg award for lifetime achievement rambled before making a 
poignant statement about his permanent entry into this country 
it was an awards show that offered few surprises every front 
runner won as expected the only suspense was whether the last 
emperor would win in all nine nominated categories it did 
the biggest thrill was seeing cher win as best actress for 
moonstruck cher like sally field before her has come a long 
way after a start in music and television that gave little hint of 
her talent 
the awards show as it has in recent years got off to a fast 
promising start the opening number with the dancing gold oscars 
was original and rousing host chevy chase set an irreverent tone 
when he addressed the audience good evening hollywood phonies 
the presentation of the animated shorts award by mickey mouse 
with an assist from tom selleck was an inspired piece of casting 
last years most eloquent winner marlee matlin of children of 
a lesser god stole the show again the hearingimpaired actress 
spoke as she announced the nominees for best actor and named 
michael douglas as the winner 
robin williams a nominee for best actor and presenter of the 
oscar for best director also stole the show in his own inimitable 
way he was very funny and when he uttered a phrase that could 
have gotten on the air only on a live show he chortled at his own 
naughtiness the phones are lighting up folks he said the 
number is 1800robin 
bernardo bertolucci won as best director for the last 
emperor when he returned later to accept another award as 
cowriter of the screenplay he explained that the guards wouldnt 
let him back into the auditorium until he displayed his oscar 
the show scheduled to run three hours ran slightly more than 
3 hours not quite a record but wearily close

the merger of two black political groups 
that led the war to end whiteminority rule in zimbabwe then 
rhodesia virtually abolishes one of africas few multiparty states 
we have one zimbabwe one nation and one national army we 
will be stronger if we have one party president robert mugabe 
said at a weekend rally 
mugabe an avowed marxist led his party to victory in elections 
held after a britishsponsored peace conference ended years of 
guerrilla warfare and zimbabwe became independent in april 1980 
his chief rival in the balloting was joseph nkomo one of the 
countrys wealthiest men they had organized guerrilla armies in 
the 1960s to gain blackmajority rule and toward the end of the 
campaign joined forces but the alliance collapsed in 1980 after 
mugabes resounding victory and scattered clashes followed between 
the supporters of both sides 
mugabe head of the zimbabwe african national union advocated 
oneparty rule and was opposed by nkomo and his zimbabwe african 
peoples union 
but last week a peoples union convention endorsed a merger 
approved in december by mugabe and nkomo on saturday national 
union conference delegates approved the agreement 
it is expected that by the end of the year mugabes party will 
be by law the sole political party in this southern african nation 
opponents say mugabes party will turn capitalist zimbabwe into 
a socialist state with parliament becoming a rubberstamp 
legislature 
supporters claim the merger will bring unity to an area divided 
by tribal differences and with political structures too fragile to 
withstand the rigors of westernstyle multiparty politics 
the merger does not basically expand mugabes solid power base 
he has been in control since his party won 57 of parliaments 100 
seats in preindependence elections and has increased the number 
the number since then to 85 
but the merger will give him the support to revise the 
britishdrafted constitution that dictated a multiparty system for 
the first 10 years after independence the constitution can be 
changed during that period only by a unanimous parliemtary vote 
the new united party will control all but one legislative seat 
a businessman goodson sithole is the only representative of a 
small party that broke from the national union 
he could block the oneparty move with a negative vote but 
isnt expected to stand up against the combined weight of the two 
main parties 
for mugabe 64 his goal of creating a marxistleninist state 
has involved more rhetoric then reality in his eight years in 
power zimbabwe remains one of africas staunchest capitalist 
countries and whites internally and externally still control the 
economy 
but mugabe has made it clear he expects the countrys leaders to 
be socialists 
surely they his opponents cannot be allowed to walk our 
public path of socialism with us when at the same time they have 
charted for themselves their own private path of capitalism he 
said at the convention on saturday 
for 70yearold nkomo the merger is a chance for the old 
lion as his supporters call him to leave the political scene 
with some of his former glory 
nkomo had been dumped from a coalition government shortly after 
the 1980 elections but when the merger plans were announced in 
december after three years of negotiations he became one of three 
senior ministers in the cabinet in the new united party he will be 
second vicepresident the no 3 slot

omerta the mafia code of silence is 
crumbling as authorities find it easier to turn mobsters into 
witnesses according to top law enforcement officials and a former 
member of the sicilian mafia 
when the going gets tough the smart change sides john c 
keeney acting chief of the justice departments criminal division 
told a senate subcommittee on monday the number and stature of 
convicted mobsters flipping to the governments side in recent 
years is unprecedented 
before keeney testified at the most extensive senate organized 
crime hearings in a quartercentury former sicilian mobster 
tommaso buscetta helped prove keeneys point 
shielded by a screen to protect the public from seeing him 
buscetta said the mafia in italy has changed so drastically because 
of the drug trade that i no longer feel bound by the code of 
omerta 
he testified before the senate permanent subcommittee on 
investigations which held dramatic hearings on organized crime a 
quartercentury ago the chief witness then was joseph valachi who 
told the panel the inner workings of la cosa nostra 
sen sam nunn dga said he will hold three more hearings so 
the panel can assess the state of organized crime 25 years after 
valachis testimony 
mondays most dramatic testimony came from buscetta who spoke 
in italian and had his words translated for the committee buscetta 
has testified previously for the us and italian governments and 
helped convict nearly 500 mobsters most in italy nunn said 
fbi director william s sessions two of his top aides and 
keeney all told the senators that law enforcement officials have 
severely damaged organized crime in part through new statutes and 
partly because the code of silence is now often broken buscetta 
gave some insight on why this has happened 
over the years i have seen our organization change from 
within buscetta testified i have seen money drugs and greed 
corrupt and destroy the cosa nostra code of honor and loyalty to 
the families 
i began to realize that drugs had changed everything the 
family loyalties and codes of respect that i had known as a mafioso 
were quickly becoming things of the past 
sessions testified omerta has been broken in recent 
years the fbi has not only secured the cooperation and testimony 
of numerous individuals who have been utilized by the lcn la cosa 
nostra to promote their criminal activities but has elicited the 
cooperation of four lcn members whose knowledge and testimony 
has enabled the fbi to expand the attack on this national criminal 
enterprise 
he identified the four as aladena frattiano the former acting 
boss of the los angeles lcn family angelo lonardo the former 
underboss of the cleveland organized crime family and thomas del 
giorno and nicholas caramandi a capo lieutenant and soldier 
respectively in the philadelphia family 
fbi executive assistant director oliver b revell iii said mafia 
families in the united states have not taken over the drug trade 
although individual organizedcrime members are involved with 
narcotics 
theres a change in lcn membership said anthony e daniels 
deputy assistant fbi director in the criminal investigative 
division where there is money to be made members of lcn will 
become involved in anything 
revell also told the committee that the fbi believes it knows 
who is responsible for the disappearance of former teamsters union 
head jimmy hoffa on july 30 1975 
revell did not name them but said they are in prison on other 
charges revell said he doubted there would be enough evidence to 
bring them to trial 
the fbi on earlier occasions has asserted that it believed it 
knew who killed hoffa an fbi memo suggested hoffas disappearance 
was linked to anthony tony pro provenzano a former new jersey 
teamsters boss and reputed organized crime captain imprisoned on a 
racketeering conviction provenzano has denied he was involved

a hospital suspended its largely unsuccessful 
effort to harvest organs for transplants from infants born with 
most of their brains missing as doctors took the sixth such baby 
off life support 
tendayold hope lovette mount of knoxville tenn was removed 
from life support monday and will be allowed to die spokesman dick 
schafer said by telephone from loma linda university medical 
center 60 miles east of los angeles 
schaefer said that while loma linda plans to maintain five to 
seven more anencephalic babies on life support so they can be used 
as organ donors the hospital wont do so until it modifies its 
existing guidelines for use of such infants who are born with most 
of their brains missing 
the review will be completed within two weeks he said refusing 
to elaborate on the planned changes 
loma lindas program was aimed at maintaining anencephalic 
babies on respirators for seven days or until they were declared 
braindead whichever came first anencephalic babies inevitably 
die within days to weeks 
the idea was to maintain them on life support so their organs 
wouldnt deteriorate as they died the sevenday limit was 
established to counter criticism that the doomed babies were being 
kept alive and suffering indefinitely merely to save the lives 
of other babies needing donated organs 
a southern california infant identified only as baby john was 
the only one of the six anencephalic babies maintained on life 
support at loma linda to be declared braindead within the 
sevenday limit but a suitable recipient for his heart and other 
organs could not be found 
none of the five others were suitable for donations of major 
organs although heart valves and corneas were transplanted from 
some of them 
loma linda surgeons did transplant an anencephalics heart into 
paul holc the son of a british columbia couple last oct 16 but 
that heart came from a baby girl who was maintained on life support 
in london ontario not at loma linda 
paul who received his new heart three hours after his birth by 
caesarean section was the worlds youngest transplant recipient 
he has been released from the hospital and physicians said recently 
he was doing well 
loma linda triggered a major medical controversy in 1984 when 
dr leonard bailey implanted a baboons heart in a girl known as 
baby fae who was born with a fatally underdeveloped heart and died 
20 days after the transplant since then the hospital turned 
toward anencephalic babies as possible organ donors for infants 
with fatal heart defects

american television viewers welcome the 
improved picture quality of highresolution television but are 
unwilling to pay a premium for it according to initial audience 
testing studies 
one study presented monday at the national association of 
broadcasters convention here found that viewers usually preferred 
the clear and more brilliant picture produced by experimental 
highdefinition tv hdtv though the perceived improvement over 
conventional tv was subtle when watched on the size of sets found 
in most american homes 
screens would have to be two to three times larger to have a 
significant impact it concluded 
there will be hdtv most viewers most of the time prefer hdtv 
to conventional tv said w russell neuman associate professor 
at the media laboratory at the massachusetts institute of 
technology who conducted the study but with the wrong price and 
the wrong programming and at the wrong time hdtv could fail 
audience research conducted by home box office which provides 
programming to cable tv systems shows that viewers particularly 
young men prefer the improvedquality picture of hdtv but were 
resistant to paying significantly more for it 
consumers are going to have to be aggressively marketed and 
the price will have to be close to the price for existing tvs 
said robert maxwell hbo vice president for research 
maxwell said the companys testing found that viewers could 
recognize hdtvs better quality picture when comparing it 
sidebyside to a conventional tv picture but most could not tell 
the difference when alternately watching an hdtv picture separately 
from a conventional one 
two hundred sixtyeight viewers participated in hbos in 
sidebyside testing and 499 in an alternate viewing test both 
groups were watched 25inch conventional sets and 28inch hdtv sets 
maxwell said his results were preliminary and his research was 
not yet completed but he said when we have better equipment 
and material and tests i think the results will show consumers 
have high interest in hdtv though they arent going to pay a 
lot more for a tv set than they are now 
the hbo and media lab research indicates that the introduction 
of hdtv to american consumers could be slow especially considering 
that the first hdtv sets are estimated to cost more than 3500 as 
with most new technology prices would be expected to drop as sales 
increase 
neuman said his research contradicts the accepted wisdom of 
video professionals which posits that hdtv knocks the socks off 
everyone who sees it represents an entirely new medium for 
storing transmitting and displaying moving images and will 
replace older media just as color tv replaced black and white 
the media lab study admittedly an early experiment was 
conducted in a shopping mall in danvers mass in early december 
for 30 minutes 613 randomly selected shoppers in groups of five 
to 20 watched a variety of programs on conventional and hdtv sets 
sixtytwo percent said they preferred the quality of hdtv 
overall a figure neuman said shows the new technology will not be 
a revolutionary development 
he said he finds no basis for tv broadcasters fears that their 
very survival could be threatened if the japanese begin selling 
hdtv video cassette recorders and receivers in the united states 
before broadcasters settle on an hdtv transmission system for their 
overtheair signals 
the japanese plan to offer a satellitebased high definition tv 
system to homes in that country in 1990 the europeans are expected 
to introduce their own system a couple of years later but us 
research has lagged

nicaraguan rebels agreed to a call 
from the leftist sandinista government to resume technical talks on 
a ceasefire plan that had stalled over arms shipments to the 
ussupported contras 
in another development the opposition newspaper la prensa 
received a fresh supply of newsprint from the government on monday 
and said it would resume publication today for the first time since 
april 5 
cristiana chamorro la prensa assistant director said the paper 
received 42 tons of newsprint from the governmentowned monopoly at 
midday monday too late for la prensa editors to put out an 
afternoon edition 
la prensa had attributed the cutoff of newsprint to 
discrimination of the government it noted that barricada the 
sandinista party mouthpiece and the progovernment el nuevo diario 
continued to publish without interruption 
the nicaraguan resistance the main contra umbrella group on 
monday night said it will send a delegation to the southern town of 
sapoa on wednesday to resume the talks there was no immediate 
reaction from the government 
earlier monday the sandinistas proposed that the talks be held 
wednesday or thursday and suggested the contras send an advance 
team to managua to prepare for highranking political discussions 
scheduled for friday 
in washington dc contra spokesman bosco matamoros released a 
statement proposing the technical talks resume at noon wednesday in 
sapoa 
toplevel contra leaders will travel to managua on friday to 
continue the peace negotiations with the sandinistas based on 
progress at the sapoa talks the statement said the high level 
commission composed of members of the directorate will arrive in 
managua april 15 subject to the work of the special commission 
it said 
the statement added that roberto ferrey secretary of the 
resistance directorate and david stadhagen another contra 
representative will arrive in managua on thursday to work out the 
agenda for the highlevel meeting 
last friday military commanders of the two sides suspended 
negotiations on defining how the contras are to gather in 
ceasefire zones in nicaragua the meetings ended after the contras 
asked for a recess of several days to discuss a 25point government 
plan 
the talks are called for in the march 23 ceasefire agreement 
reached by sandinista and contra leaders in sapoa under terms of 
the plan contra guerrillas were to gather at the zones during the 
first 15 days of april a provisional 60day ceasefire went into 
effect april 1 
in six days of discussions both sides agreed on seven zones but 
failed to define the operating conditions and security measures 
a 34point contra proposal would allow the rebels to maintain 
munitions in the zones it also would prohibit the sandinistas from 
receiving any military aid from the soviet bloc 
paul reichler an american lawyer negotiating for the 
sandinistas described those two points as absolutely 
unacceptable 
the ceasefire plan would permit the contras to receive only 
food and basic supplies channeled through a neutral organization 
political leaders of both sides had been scheduled to meet last 
wednesday in managua but the rebels postponed the meeting saying 
the technical talks in sapoa had not advanced enough to move toward 
political issues 
the rebels also have said they will not continue the highlevel 
political talks unless they are free to meet with opposition 
leaders in managua 
the government maintains that the peace agreement specifies 
contra representation in politics begins only after the rebels move 
into the ceasefire zones

the us embassy applauded a 
decision by president jose napoleon duarte that revoked an amnesty 
for three men charged in the 1985 slaying of six americans 
duarte cited an international treaty as the legal basis for 
denying amnesty to the three suspects said rene valdivieso the 
secretary of the martial court who announced the decision monday 
on the issue of amnesty it has been the position of the us 
government that this attack on innocent unarmed persons should not 
go unpunished said us embassy spokesman joseph mcmanus we 
welcome president duartes decision to forward the case to the 
courts where evidence can be brought and a decision rendered 
thirteen people were killed on june 19 1985 when assailants 
wearing salvadoran ary uniforms opened fire with automatic weapons 
on patrons at two outdoor cafes in san salvador among the dead 
were four offduty marines and two us businessmen 
the marines who were guards at the us embassy wore civilian 
clothes and sat at two tables with other young people when the 
attackers drove up 
a littleknown leftist group the mardoqueo cruz urban guerrilla 
commandos claimed responsibility for the killings the group is an 
offshoot of one of the five guerrilla armies that form the 
farabundo marti national liberation front which has been fighting 
the usbacked salvadoran government for eight years 
juan garcia melendez and jose dimas aguilar are charged with 
helping plan the pink zone massacre named after the 
fashionable district of shops and restaurants where the killings 
occurred 
william rivas bolanos is the only one of the three the 
government alleges was among the gunmen 
none of the three has been tried eight other people who are 
fugitives allegedly took part in the crime 
duartes government decreed a broad amnesty in november 1987 as 
part of a regional peace accord about 450 people were freed under 
the measure which applied to those convicted or accused of 
politically motivated crimes 
when the martial court the countrys highest military tribunal 
ruled in january that the three men should receive amnesty the 
us government called the decision morally mistaken and 
politically damaging 
the us congress later approved a measure that calls for 
withholding 10 percent of appropriated economic aid to el salvador 
if the suspects are freed the three were kept in jail pending 
duartes review of the case 
a lower court military judge had ruled the three should be 
covered by the amnesty because their alleged crime was politically 
motivated duarte as commanderinchief of the armed forces is 
empowered to review the martial courts decision

the government says that it will immediately 
begin accepting applications for amnesty from illegal aliens who 
overstayed their student and tourist visas 
until further notice the immigration and naturalization service 
also announced monday that it will defer the fee for such 
applications and issue a temporary work authorization card in 
accordance with a court directive 
ins regulations originally stipulated that nonimmigrant aliens 
who overstayed their tourist or student visas must demonstrate that 
any violation of their immigration status had come to the attention 
of the ins before jan 1 1982 for them to qualify for the amnesty 
program 
in a ruling on a classaction suit us district judge stanley 
sporkin said the regulation was too restrictive and declared that 
congress intended the law to mean that any government record such 
as tax or social security documents could be used to document that 
an illegal alien was known to federal authorities as of jan 1 
1982 
immigration experts say the clarifications affect at least 
50000 people 
under the 1986 immigration law illegal aliens who have been in 
the country at least since jan 1 1982 may qualify for legalized 
status a 12month application period for the amnesty program is 
due to expire may 4

auditorium as inside drawing gasps from more than a thousand fans 
packed into street grandstands when she stepped from her limousine 
in a stunning seethrough gown 
go go go go go chanted fans on each side of a 
redcarpeted walkway leading to the cavernous hall as nominees 
arrived monday amid a hullabaloo that has become an annual rite of 
the academy awards ceremony 
cher who won best actress for moonstruck continued her 
tradition of outrageous outfits despite the seeming consensus among 
the stars this year for toneddown mostly black fashions in 
variations of long short strapless bodyhugging and 
blackonwhite or whiteonblack 
arriving fashionably late in the 90degree heat cher knocked 
the scream meter off the scale when she stepped from her limousine 
in a diaphanous outfit partly covered by a dark black cape and 
swept into the auditorium 
however for a time the oscar ritual of hasty introductions 
interviews and cheers for favorite stars gave way to a traffic jam 
perhaps caused by the shows move from its longtime home at the 
dorothy chandler pavilion in the los angeles music center 
please make room for the people outside to get in oscars 
greeter army archerd pleaded over a loudspeaker as arriving members 
of the academy of motion pictures arts and sciences and nominees 
backed up at the auditoriums doors as showtime neared 
we are working in very tight quarters said archerd the 
academy has decided to be here for three years so you better get 
used to it 
booooo shouted the crowd packed into bleachers alongside 
the walkway 
the 60th annual oscars marked the award shows first return to 
the shrine on the edge of an old neighborhood next to the 
university of southern california since 1947 
the traffic was so bad i was being asphyxiated in the limo 
said character actor peter mark richman who appears in tvs 
bonanza the next generation 
fans dressed in shorts sandals and tshirts watched a 10block 
procession of limousines and frequented a garden hose that was set 
up by the academy for curbside refreshment in the heat 
fifteen minutes before showtime actresses meryl streep and 
glenn close who is nine months pregnant were seen walking quickly 
up jefferson boulevard to the theater to make it on time 
fatal attraction costar anne archer wore a wideshouldered 
sleeveless black dress with a vcut back and a silvered midriff 
along with black gloves sally kirkland star of anna was 
elegant in a strapless black gown with a velvet bodice 
faye dunaway was sharp in a black skirt and a white jacket with 
a blackstripe design dirty dancing star jennifer grey came in 
a tight shoulderless longsleeve mini liza minnelli topped a 
long black dress with a red cape 
there were daring exceptions candice bergen arrived 
bareshouldered in a formfitting red dress marlee matlin stepped 
out in strapless kneelength purple dress with a large bow at her 
waist daryl hannah glittered in a whitegold kneelength dress 
and gold high heels 
and of course the perennial edie williams strutted back and 
forth in front of the cameras in a pale blue bikini top and mini 
skirt sporting a puppy on one shoulder

would not be a good approach to start at the table with the most 
extreme elements thats a formula for catastrophe

of your top jewishamerican and proisraeli leaders live we should 
begin to talk here to implore both sides to a higher level of 
security

meet again with arafat jackson has been widely criticized for 
meeting with arafat in 1979 
abdeen jabara president of the americanarab

principles in his quest for the presidency 
but james zogby executive director of the arabamerican 
institute said jackson has a nineyear record of commitment to 
palestinian rights and to justice for both israelis and 
palestinians 
nearly one quarter of the democrats expected to vote in new 
yorks april 19 primary are jewish and for many of them the 
future of israel is a critical issue 
while in new york jackson also continued his appeal to 
bluecollar voters some union leaders called jackson one of us 
at a labor rally on his behalf 
hes the only candidate who will get on the picket line and 
walk with the workers said karen lantz vice president of the 
independent federation of flight attendants after jackson 
addressed a crowd of 5000 labor leaders and union members monday 
night 
lantz who characterized jackson as one of us said the 
other candidates may support labor but you never see them 
jackson told the overflow crowd at the jacob k javits 
convention center that bluecollar workers will have a friend in 
the white house if he becomes president 
jackson reminded the crowd that he has stood with them numerous 
times on picket lines and asked them to stand with him now by 
supporting his candidacy 
jackson also campaigned north of the city monday addressing a 
rally at rockland community college and greeting workers at a 
general motors plant in north tarrytown 
at the gm plant and the labor rally he sounded his familiar 
theme of battling economic violence and told the workers we 
built our campaign at the plant gate

sonny bono whose exwife cher won best actress at the oscars 
vied for best candidate in a mayoral race with six opponents today 
in palm springs calif one of several elections in texas and 
california 
in texas rep beau boulter of amarillo opposed houston 
businessman wes gilbreath in a primary runoff for the republican 
nomination to challenge democratic sen lloyd bentsen 
in san francisco eight candidates were running in a special 
election to fill the state assembly seat vacated by mayor art 
agnos the top contenders were former us rep john burton 55 
and fellow liberal democrat roberta achtenberg 37 a lesbian 
rights lawyer whose election would make her the legislatures first 
openly gay member 
bono a 53yearold entertainer and restaurateur built a 
recording career with cher during more than the two decades and 
was the butt of her jokes during their tv variety show cher won 
the best actress at monday nights oscar ceremonies for her 
performance in the movie moonstruck 
bono said he has campaigned hard to convince voters his 
candidacy for the parttime 15000ayear mayors job was no 
publicity stunt they thought it was a joke he said recently 
now they take me seriously 
also running were vice mayor eli birer businesswoman deyna 
hodges accountant lloyd maryanov agua caliente indian tribe 
secretary ray patencio real estate agent neil beatty and retired 
dentist lewis friedman 
the texas runoff was required because no candidate received a 
majority in the march 8 fourway gop primary 
gilbreath who has spent about 1 million of his own money in 
the race was the top candidate with 37 percent of the vote 
boulter who received 30 percent later picked up endorsements from 
the third and fourthplace finishers as well as the majority of 
texas republican leaders 
rep jack kemp rny campaigned monday for boulter in several 
texas cities boulter a 46yearold twoterm congressman backed 
kemps failed bid for the gop presidential nomination 
the presidential race and gilbreaths money were the campaigns 
main issues gilbreath a 59yearold firsttime office seeker 
said boulters support of kemp would hurt texas if vice president 
george bush becomes president 
boulter said gilbreath supported former television evangelist 
pat robertsons unsuccessful bid for the gop presidential 
nomination gilbreath has declined to say he voted for in texas 
republican presidential primary 
the boulter campaign which spent about 250000 complained 
about gilbreaths deep pockets 
bentsen chairman of the senate finance committee breezed to 
renomination in march over a littleknown san antonio professor 
the incumbent has said he does not care which republican he faces 
in his november bid for a fourth term 
in san francisco achtenberg 37 campaigned monday at transit 
stations and a senior citizens home 
we are extremely optimistic she said it all depends on 
the voter turnout our polls indicate its a dead heat 
burton visited churches in the district on sunday reminding 
parishioners of his civil rights voting record and that of his late 
brother phillip and late sisterinlaw sala who also 
represented the city in congress 
burton who held the assembly seat between 1965 and 1975 was 
sidelined from politics in 1983 by a cocaine addiction 
the other candidates were republicans max woods and brian 
mavrogeorge libertarian george meyer peace and freedom candidate 
melissa ehman and independents hope joles and james schmitt 
the district is overwhelmingly democratic and candidates from 
other parties were given little chance of mounting serious 
opposition 
if no candidate wins a majority the top two votegetters will 
face each other in a runoff june 7 
agnos twoyear term ends this year and the democratic primary 
for the seat also will be held june 7

the hijackers of a kuwaiti jumbo jet 
today said they have named their aircraft the plane of martyrdom 
and death and claimed they have put on their death shrouds 
one of the hijackers made the declaration in a statement radioed 
to larnaca airport control tower he cited koranic verses usually 
read at funerals that said those killed in the name of god are 
always alive 
earlier today the hijackers of the kuwait airways 747 who shot 
and killed a second passenger on monday threatened the lives of 
the nearly 50 remaining hostages and again demanded fuel for the 
plane so they could leave cyprus for an unspecified neutral 
country 
the hijackers who are armed with grenades and handguns did not 
explain whether their statement today meant they planned to carry 
out their oftrepeated threat to blow up the plane 
however their statement revealed as had been suspected that 
the hijackers are fanatical shiite moslems 
the statement said hail the glory of imam mahdi the 
messiahlike holy person shiites believe will one day appear on 
earth only shiite moslems revere the imams or saints among the 
islamic sects before the statement it only was known for certain 
that the hijackers were arabspeaking 
the hijackers have demanded kuwait free 17 proiranian 
terrorists all but one of them shiites who were convicted in 1984 
for bombing the us and french embassies in kuwait the emirate 
has repeatedly refused to free them 
akis fantis cypriot government spokesman earlier today said no 
negotiations were under way as the hijacking entered its eighth 
day fantis added that the chances of storming the plane at larnaca 
airport were zero 
fiftytwo people including at least five or six hijackers 
were believed to be aboard the boeing 747 after the bloodstained 
body of a man was thrown through the jets door on monday his 
hands tied behind his back the hostages include three members of 
kuwaits extensive royal family a man and two women 
on monday kuwaiti foreign minister sheik sabah alahmed 
alsabah said his country is prepared to lose more hostages rather 
than give in to the hijackers 
we will try our utmost to protect our dear ones aboard the 
plane but we will not surrender to any blackmail even if we lose 
more of them he told reporters in kuwait this is not the 
decision of kuwaits government it is a decision of the people 
he added that the presence of three members of the ruling alsabah 
family aboard the jet will not influence our decision 
to complicate matters terrorist groups in lebanon have 
threatened to kill foreign hostages they are holding including 
three americans if security forces storm the plane in a bid to 
free the passengers 
in their statement today the hijackers declared in classical 
koranic arabic we have decided to call our plane the plane of 
martyrdom and death death with glory is better than life under 
humiliation we call on the kuwaiti people to revolt against the 
kuwaiti dictatorship wed like to point out were not against the 
people of kuwait but against the regime 
it continued we have decided to wear the death shrouds under 
our clothes and that either all our 17 brothers come back to us or 
else we shall meet in our shrouds in the heaven of eternal 
happiness 
the reference to wearing death shrouds under our clothes may 
have indicated the hijackers are not yet prepared to become 
martyrs but the tone of the statement and its repeated references 
to death appeared designed to put pressure on cypriot authorities 
to refuel the plane 
after the passenger was killed monday an unidentified hijacker 
told the tower we have executed a kuwaiti officer we also 
reconfirm the craft must be refueled immediately immediately 
before we take more dangerous steps 
fantis said the slain passenger had been shot twice in the head 
and that fingerprints were being sent to kuwait for identification 
doctors at the larnaca morgue said the side of his face was 
badly injured possibly because he had been beaten before he was 
killed when officials refused repeated demands by the hijackers to 
refuel the plane 
the hostage slain on monday was the second of three kuwaiti 
military men reported aboard the jet doctors said another military 
man a 24yearold border guard also was beaten 18 to 24 hours 
before he was shot three times in the head on saturday and dropped 
on the tarmac 
the reference to flying to a neutral country was the first 
time since landing at larnaca that the hijackers have given any 
inkling of where they want to go they did not name any country 
but kuwaits alqabas daily on monday reported that algerian 
officials have become involved in the negotiations 
the plane was hijacked on tuesday with 112 people aboard on a 
flight from bangkok to kuwait and forced down in mashhad northeast 
iran where 57 people were freed the plane left iran on friday 
after refueling 
after lebanon and syria refused to let it touch down at their 
airports the plane landed at larnaca after the pilot radioed he 
was running out of fuel 
another captive an ailing 32yearold kuwaiti was freed in 
larnaca on saturday apparently after plo intervention

has been replaced by robert griffin 
in an unusual arrangement circuit judges robert benson of kent 
county and maureen reilly of wayne county began taking testimony 
monday in a joint evidentiary hearing assistant prosecutors mark 
vander molen of kent county and paul bruno of wayne county are 
seeking decisions from the judges allowing use of electrophoresis 
tests as evidence in stabbing cases they are handling 
vander molen is prosecuting a case against robert tanner 26 
charged with two counts of assault with intent to murder bruno is 
prosecuting scott stoughton 21 charged with two counts of 
firstdegree murder in the deaths of two people in taylor 
we think the supreme court decision was a mistake and we 
hope to correct it vander molen said before mondays hearing 
began 
but bernard schaefer tanners attorney said he doesnt think 
the test has been accepted generally by scientists for use in 
criminal trials 
i think the prosecution and the prosecution community want to 
change the ruling he said theres been a change in the 
supreme court its not that there has been a scientific 
advancement 
electrophoresis is a process to separate molecules of a 
substance by their electrical charge it has been used in genetic 
testing identification of certain enzymes in a variety of organs 
and in analysis of dna which carries genetic characteristics 
the hearing is expected to last a week and should involve 
detailed scientific testimony about proteins enzymes and 
markers they leave in dried blood 
vander molen said use of the test in his case against tanner is 
not critical but he said weve got nearly 10 cases in which we 
need this test this kind of evidence is important in the most 
serious of cases

describing an ache may be easy to the sufferer 
but to pain researchers the feeling of hurt is complex almost 
beyond description 
researchers at a fourday international pain measurement 
conference that began monday are trying to develop a unified theory 
for the study of pain the conference is sponsored by the 
university of washington and funded by a grant from the national 
institutes of health 
one in three people in america suffers from chronic pain and 
millions are routinely incapacitated by it but medical science 
often can do little to to prevent or effectively treat recurrent 
pain because patients are suffering from something that cant be 
seen felt or observed by someone else 
the subjective and intangible nature of pain frustrates many 
people involved in its research 
the problem with the meaning of the word pain has been around 
since aristotle said dr john d loeser a neurosurgeon and 
director of the universitys multidisciplinary pain center 
how do you go about measuring pain loeser asks were not 
very far along in the clinical setting its too complex a 
phenomenon 
only within about the last two decades has the problem of pain 
gained serious attention in medical research in large part because 
of the pioneering efforts of dr john bonica chairman emeritus of 
the schools department of anesthesiology bonicas work on the 
management of pain which emphasizes a comprehensive approach 
rather than hitandmiss drug therapies paved the way for the 
serious study of pain 
everybody measures pain in a different way said c richard 
chapman a psychopharmacologist in pain research at the university 
and the independent fred hutchinson cancer research center 
we dont at present have a theory a single theory that 
everyone agrees upon said chapman 
pain measurement research generally relies on laboratory tests 
of animals lab tests on humans or studies of patient care each 
with its own accepted methods for measuring and defining pain none 
completely translates into an acceptable method for the other 
chapman said pain often is taken seriously by medical 
professionals only when tissue damage can be identified although a 
lot of chronic pain apparently exists without any identifiable 
tissue damage 
some researchers try to measure this kind of pain by analyzing 
behavior or looking at brain waves and other electrical signals 
those dealing with humans ask the sufferer to describe the hurt 
but how can you tell if an infant who cant yet speak is 
experiencing pain asked loeser 
university of washington researchers expect a good deal of 
argument and contention at the conference in fact they 
deliberately scheduled scientists with opposing views to speak in 
succession about 60 researchers are expected to attend 
its my belief that we can bring this all together if we can 
find a uniform theory for pain said chapman when we have 
reached it our power to solve the perplexities of pain 
scientifically and to control the human and animal suffering that 
it causes will be greatly increased

a convicted murderer has flown to israel after 
renouncing his citizenship under a special clemency agreement that 
allowed him to finish his prison term working on a kibbutz 
william shapiro 62 had served 13 years of a life term that 
carried a minimum 25year sentence when he boarded an el al jet 
monday night 
a notary public witnessed his renunciation after a federal judge 
said it did not fall under his authority 
i have researched the law thoroughly but i have found nothing 
in any federal law which gives me jurisdiction to accept such 
renunciation judge eugene p spellman told shapiro and defense 
attorney jan jacobowitz before calling a notary public to the 
courtroom 
shapiro was granted clemency under an agreement between the 
state board of executive clemency made up of gov bob martinez and 
his cabinet and the israeli government because of shapiros past 
ties to israels old haganah a secret military force that helped 
win israeli independence in 1948 
shapiro a miami businessman born in new york was accused of 
hiring two men to kill a business partner a dade county circuit 
jury convicted him in february 1976 of firstdegree murder and 
conspiracy to commit murder for the pipebeating death of burt 
dewitt 
but shapiros supporters have long pointed to his haganah 
background his world war ii and korean war service as a marine 
combat officer and his 12 years with israels police to support 
their claim that he couldnt have been been guilty 
elements of the haganah with about 10000 members by the 
mid1930s served with the british in defense of the middle east 
during world war ii after israel gained independence in 1948 the 
haganah became the core of israels army 
shapiros legal file shows he didnt participate directly in the 
pipebeating 
the evidence just wasnt very strong against shapiro said 
attorney alvin lodish who was asked to handle the case by israels 
consul general in miami rahamin timor it is highly unusual to 
have someone convicted of firstdegree murder on evidence like 
that 
clemency was granted last month under the deal shapiro had to 
renounce his us citizenship and relocate at kibbutz 
ayelethashar where he will work at least eight hours a day six 
days a week 
herut lapid director of the united kibbutz movement of which 
the collective farm is a member assured florida officials in a 
letter that a rehabilitation plan has been worked out for shapiro

despite us criticism israel today threatened 
to deport more palestinians from the occupied territories to break 
a 4monthold uprising on monday israel expelled eight arabs to 
neighboring lebanon 
in another development israeli soldiers killed two palestinians 
on monday during clashes in the occupied west bank eight arabs 
were wounded 
the deaths brought to 143 the number of arabs killed since 
rioting began dec 8 two israelis have been killed a teenage 
settler and a soldier 
israel on monday issued deportation orders for 12 other 
palestinians among them were six arabs from the west bank village 
of beita where an israeli settler girl and two palestinians were 
killed in a clash last week 
there are a list of others slated for deportation we will not 
hesitate to deport them if we find it necessary shmuel goren a 
defense official who administers the west bank told israel radio 
today 
israeli sources speaking on condition of anonymity said they 
drew up a list of 200 palestinians who were slated for expulsion in 
january but sharply reduced the number at the time following an 
appeal from the united states 
prime minister yitzhak shamir interviewed today by army radio 
said he hoped the expulsions would crush the wave of arab rioting 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip which were captured in 
the 1967 middle east war 
we know other countries and people in other countries are not 
happy with this but we have to take care of our security and not 
them shamir said 
critics on monday claimed the expulsions were aimed at appeasing 
jewish settlers who were angered by an army report saying the 
girl 15yearold tirza porat was accidentally killed by a bullet 
from a gun a settler used while guarding a group of jewish hikers 
settlers say the girl was killed by arabs 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman on 
monday said the expulsions only further inflame passions and 
violate international human rights agreements 
israeli troops killed two palestinians on monday after a patrol 
was attacked by dozens of protesters who threw stones and bottles 
in the west bank village of rai near nablus the army said 
arab doctors and hospital officials said israeli soldiers on 
monday wounded eight palestinians three in rai including an 
11yearold girl and a 14yearold boy four arabs in nablus and 
another in jenin 
also monday the army said 4800 arabs have been arrested since 
dec 8 of those 500 were convicted 3400 await trial and 900 are 
held in administrative detention which allows imprisonment without 
trial for six months 
the eight deportees five from the gaza strip and three from the 
west bank arrived in lebanons bekaa valley on monday night and 
asked to be handed over to the international red cross 
an army helicopter flew the men to israels selfproclaimed 
security zone in southern lebanon they were handed 50 each and 
led to two waiting taxis 
israel television showed some of the men carrying belongings in 
plastic bags as the taxis drove off one of the deportees made the 
v for victory sign with his fingers 
the army described the deportees as senior members of terror 
groups and said some were organizers and instigators of 
antiisraeli protests 
the most prominent is abed al aziz uda rafia 33 of gaza city 
described by the army as spiritual leader of islamic jihad in the 
gaza strip islamic jihad or islamic holy war is a moslem 
fundamentalist group pledged to destroying israel 
critics say such measures violate the geneva convention which 
bars deportation of civilians in times of war israeli officials 
maintain the convention only applies to mass expulsions 
palestinian leaders on monday denounced the expulsions as 
collective punishment and said they would fuel more unrest 
the army said the six beita residents ordered deported took part 
in a stoning attack on 16 israeli teenage hikers and two armed 
guards from the jewish west bank settlement of elon moreh 
a preliminary army report concluded that miss porat was struck 
by a bullet from the gun of romem al dubi one of two guards 
accompanying the hikers 
the report set off a sharp political debate along party lines 
with settlers and rightwing politicians denouncing it as onesided 
and hasty and demanding the resignation of the army chief of staff 
some hikers insist miss porat was shot by an arab that some saw 
pointing a sovietmade rifle from a rooftop

councilors the average age of the premier vice premiers and nine 
councilors dropped from 67 to 61

beijing mayor chen xitong and chen junsheng who also retained his 
post of secretary general of the state council

a cabinet minister said panama will 
be flexible with american companies caught between local law and 
us economic sanctions aimed at ousting the nations strongman 
gen manuel antonio noriega 
in another development hundreds of teachers peacefully 
demonstrated on monday chanting we dont want communism and 
pineappleface you must go a reference to noriegas jowly 
pockmarked face 
the teachers demonstrated more than two hours at the ministry of 
education monday demanding to be paid opposition leaders plan 
daily demonstrations throughout the week even though recent 
protests in the 10month campaign by the opposition to oust noriega 
have been poorly attended or blocked by police 
the problem faced by us companies was discussed monday by 
commerce and industries minister mario rognoni at a meeting with 30 
representatives of american companies 
the way the act has come out if they comply with the 
panamanian laws they are defying the american law and if they 
comply with the american law they are defying the panamanian law 
we hope to find a medium solution he said 
on friday president reagan invoked a law banning americans and 
us companies from making tax and other payments to the government 
noriega head of panamas 15000member defense forces and the 
power behind the civilian government is under separate indictments 
by two federal grand juries in florida on narcotics trafficking 
charges 
the united states recognizes eric arturo delvalle as panamas 
president reagan ordered the tax payments to be directed into an 
escrow account set up for delvalle who was deposed in february 
after trying to fire noriega 
the order was the latest in a string of economic sanctions 
enacted by the reagan administration in a bid to force noriega to 
step down 
rognoni said the government is looking for ways to keep american 
companies operating in panama where us investment totals about 
35 billion 
much depends on how washington interprets the law he said 
we are sad that the measures are going to affect american 
companies that have been traditionally friends of panama that have 
been part of our development rognoni said they have been with 
us many decades some of them from the start of our country 
fred denton executive director of the american chamber of 
commerce in panama city said rognoni made no threats against 
american companies 
the treasury department is expected to issue clearer guidelines 
and exceptions to the order soon 
the united states previously ordered 50 million in panamanian 
funds frozen in american banks provoking an economic crisis that 
has kept panamanian banks closed since march 3 
the government has failed to meet public payrolls for over a 
month panamanians with paychecks have been unable to cash them or 
gain access to their savings 
panamanian industry could be virtually paralyzed within two 
months because of the bank closures said carlos valencia 
president of the panama industrial association 
he said half the countrys industry already was idle and 
construction had halted the only industries that could expect to 
continue operating under current conditions were those that relied 
upon domestic raw materials or were producing essential food and 
beverage items valencia said 
noriegas departure as head of the military and the 
democratization of panama are essential conditions to solve the 
crisis he said

rescuers arrived said a friend who survived 
timothy daniels 19 describing the ordeal shared by him and 
jimmie lee thacker from his hospital bed in this gulf coast city on 
monday said he had daydreams about grape soda and ice cream while 
adrift 
daniels who was rescued saturday was in stable condition today 
after being moved out of the intensive care unit at seven rivers 
community hospital he was being treated for hypothermia sunburn 
starvation and dehydration said a nursing supervisor who asked 
that her name not be used 
thacker 25 died late friday or early saturday 
all i know is that he wanted to see his little girl again 
before he died said daniels a shrimper thacker was separated 
from his wife and 5yearold girl who live in virginia 
the ordeal began march 28 when daniels and thacker went to 
anclote key an island north of tarpon springs in a 14foot skiff 
with two friends 
at dusk daniels and thacker left the island to get matches and 
more soft drinks they never came back 
their friends got back to the mainland the next morning by 
hitching a ride from a passing fisherman and told family members 
about the disappearence prompting a coast guard search the next 
day the searchers gave up a week later 
daniels said the shore was out of sight when the boat lost 
power they drifted south and west and lost their bearings 
all he and thacker had to drink were two bottles of pepsi which 
they emptied the first night so they could use them to bail out the 
boat after it was drenched by 16foot waves 
i didnt use my head i freaked out daniels said i could 
have used the engine cover to bail 
desperate for water daniels daydreamed and used saltwater to 
rinse his mouth he said he spent much of his time praying 
on several occasions porpoises came to the boat and lifted 
their snouts apparently to see if the men had any fish for them 
seeing the porpoises made me feel better daniels said 
when they had been adrift for several days a big shrimp boat 
came into view 
believing help had finally come daniels picked up the engine 
box and began waving it frantically to get the other boats 
attention i was yelling and hollering at the top of my lungs and 
everything he said 
but the other boat didnt approach 
it just kept going daniels said one person on board 
raised his hand and waved as the boat pulled away 
daniels was rescued when a charter boat spotted him 14 miles 
west of crystal river 
despite his experience he said hes looking forward to getting 
back to work on the gulf 
its my home away from home daniels said its how i make 
my living

a mostly mormon jury will sit in judgment 
of four members of a renegade polygamist clan charged in the 
bombing of a mormon chapel and the subsequent 13day standoff with 
police 
federal prosecutors plan to call at least 150 witnesses 
including a mormon bishop neighbors of the defendants and 
reporters in the highprofile case beginning today 
defense lawyers however arent sure it can be judged fairly 
attorney fred metos asked if the 12 jurors seated friday truly 
were the defendants peers responded they have no peers 
a utah correction officer was killed in an exchange of gunfire 
at the end of the siege the utah attorney generals office plans 
to file homicide charges as soon as the federal trial ends said 
associate attorney general paul warner 
the trial will be one of the most closely followed in recent 
memory in a state with an estimated 30000 members of polygamist 
families most coexist peacefully with their mormon neighbors who 
make up nearly 70 percent of utahs population 
the mormon church renounced polygamy in 1890 and now 
excommunicates advocates and practitioners of multiplewife 
marriages 
the four defendants include vickie singer 44 mother of seven 
and widow of slain polygamist john singer who was gunned down in 
1979 by police serving a contempt citation at the same farm where 
his family held authorities at bay while awaiting the dead 
patriarchs resurrection 
law enforcement officers believe mrs singer was the brains 
behind the bombing and standoff while her soninlaw addam swapp 
provided the muscle 
according to mrs singers diary submitted as evidence during 
pretrial hearings swapp and two others planted the bomb at the 
kamas stake center in marion on jan 16 as the singer women prayed 
at the family home two miles away 
swapp 27 and mrs singer are charged with seven and eight 
counts respectively in a ninecount indictment that was handed up 
shortly after their arrests it was reduced last week to eight 
counts when us district judge bruce s jenkins dismissed a 
conspiracy charge 
charged with four counts each are jonathan swapp 21 addam 
swapps brother and john timothy singer mrs singers 21yearold 
wheelchairbound son singer is state authorities prime suspect in 
the slaying of the corrections officer 
all four defendants are charged with the attempted killing of 
fbi agents during the standoff assault on federal officers and two 
firearms violations 
mrs singer and swapp are charged additionally with using an 
explosive to damage the chapel use of a bomb and possession of a 
bomb mrs singer also faces one count of possession of a sawedoff 
shotgun 
in telephone calls to news organizations shortly after the 
bombing mrs singer and swapp said the blast was symbolic of the 
collapse of the church state and nation that would occur with 
the second coming of christ and the return of john singer 
clan members contend singers death was the result of a 
governmentchurch conspiracy and a long train of abuse 
against the family 
addam swapps attorneys asked that the trial be moved out of 
state arguing their client could not receive a fair hearing in 
mormondominated utah 
while jenkins has not ruled on the motion john bucher an 
attorney for swapp said monday the case probably would not be 
transferred once the trial begins 
bucher and metos representing john timothy singer said the 
pool of 170 prospective jurors that reported for possible court 
duty last week was 90 percent mormon

an investigator today ruled out the 
possibility that the hijackers of a kuwaiti airliner smuggled their 
weapons on board the plane in bangkok through a ramp area used by 
service personnel 
the possibility was raised on monday by rodney wallis head of 
security for the montrealbased international air transport 
association 
the kuwaiti jet was carrying 112 people when it was hijacked 
april 5 on a flight from bangkok to kuwait and forced down in iran 
the hijackers who are armed with grenades and handguns later 
forced the plane to larnaca cyprus where they have killed two of 
the approximately 50 passengers they are still holding hostage 
it is not possible group capt anake udit said today when 
asked about wallis theory anake a deputy managing director of 
the airports authority of thailand is a member of a team 
investigating what happened during the 15 hours the kuwait airways 
jumbo jet was on the ground in bangkok 
anyone going through the ramp area had to go through tough 
security clearance anake said in a telephone interview that 
is not easy 
on monday wallis said on the basis of discussions weve had 
so far the probability is that weapons were placed on board the 
aircraft through the coercion or collusion of staff on the ramp 
the international air transport association is an international 
association of commercial airlines 
anake said kuwait airways hires guards from the airport 
authority and from a private security firm to guard its planes 
while in bangkok the security men do not take their eyes off the 
plane once it landed he said 
anake said the airport authority has not discussed the origin of 
the weapons with the air transport association we expected 
suppositions like this and were saying the weapons didnt come 
from here 
thai investigators have theorized that the weapons were smuggled 
aboard before the plane reached bangkok on april 4 from kuwait 
they said the hijackers may have left the weapons on board during 
the stop 
on the possible coercion or collusion of staff on the ramp 
anake said it was more likely they the hijackers used their 
own people 
he said airport authority investigators were questioning about 
100 people including guards of the private security company and 
airport authority personnel including cleaners mechanics 
engineers and employees of the bangkok airport fuel service 
anake said he could not say when the probe would be completed 
a separate investigation team is headed by interior minister

housing subsidies and most free school meals have 
ended for needy britons under prime minister margaret thatchers 
revamping of britains 43yearold welfare system the latest 
target in her war against socialism 
pensioners presented a petition at mrs thatchers downing 
street office after the changes went into effect monday 
the legislation allowing the changes was approved 18 months ago 
but the implementation of the program has rekindled outcries among 
opposition legislators and social welfare groups 
legislators from mrs thatchers conservative party expected 
renewed opposition when parliament resumes today 
the changes affect 86 million people including 1 million of 
the poor whose housing subsidies will end but thatcher said monday 
that the plan would raise benefits for lowincome working families 
and give disabled people higher payments 
under the plan most free school meals are taken away and most 
grants with which the needy can buy beds and stoves have been 
changed to interestfree loans 
revamping of the welfare system is the third part of a thatcher 
government program that has curbed state spending and greatly 
reduced the power of labor unions 
for us the quality of life has just slipped a notch said 
reg white 73 a retired carpenter whose benefits drop by about 5 
a week 
he and his wife katherine live in a subsidized apartment in 
kingston outside london most of their 17350 weekly income is 
from state pensions which remain the same but cuts in housing 
subsidies leave the couple worse off 
critics in the socialist labor party accuse mrs thatcher of a 
fundamental attack on the welfare state established by a labor 
administration in 1945 and expanded by every government since 
mrs thatcher says she is not cutting the 86 billion welfare 
bill which represents is onetenth of the nations gross national 
product but refocusing it on the truly needy 
john moore secretary for social services says the idea is to 
wean britons from the dependency culture some may lose their 
free stoves and beds the argument goes but 750 million is 
reserved for those prepared to hold lowpaid jobs rather than 
depend only on welfare 
your targets are nonsense labor party leader neil kinnock 
declared in an angry exchange with the prime minister in the house 
of commons your reform is often a little extra to the very 
worstoff paid by those who are the next worstoff the result 
will inevitably be a spread of poverty 
while a poor family such as the whites loses about 5 a week 
taxes for an executive making the equivalent of 187000 a year 
fall by 65 a day 
mrs thatcher said welfare expenditure would rise next year by 
about 375 billion and added 
what youre saying is that you can never ever have a 
restructuring of social security if anyone loses thats an 
absolutely ridiculous thing to say 
bishop david jenkins of durham fourthranking prelate in the 
church of england described the welfare reform as verging on the 
wicked 
conflicting statistics abound mrs thatcher says only 12 
percent of claimants will be worse off but the governmentappointed 
social security advisory committee puts it at 43 percent with 38 
percent better off 
most of those affected about oneseventh of britains 56 
million people are individuals or families whose incomes are from 
welfare state pensions or weekly wages ranging from about 
150225 the average weekly wage in britain is 450 and basic 
welfare for a childless unemployed couple remains at 99 a week

a series of explosions and a fire at an oil 
field supply manufacturing plant early today forced the evacuations 
of nearby residents authorities said 
two plant employees suffered minor injuries and were treated 
and released at a fort worth hospital 
the explosion was at the owens tool co located between godley 
and cresson about 25 miles southwest of fort worth 
authorities said they ordered the evacuations of about 30 people 
from a square mile of the mostly rural area around the plant

stored in the area 
dean owens the plants owner said a charge being manufactured 
for use in oil drilling operations exploded triggering other 
explosions and a fire the plant was destroyed he said

gov rose mofford has joined those who 
want the may 17 recall election canceled on grounds she shouldnt 
have to risk removal when the recall was aimed at her predecessor 
the ousted evan mecham 
the arizona supreme court was scheduled to hear arguments today 
on a taxpayers lawsuit that seeks cancellation of the special vote 
holding the election would provide that governor mofford could 
be removed from office by virtue of recall petitions aimed against 
governor mecham according to a legal brief filed monday by mrs 
moffords attorney david campbell 
the constitution does not provide for removal of the governor 
by a recall aimed at her predecessor mrs moffords brief said 
mecham was removed from office april 4 after an impeachment 
conviction by the senate and mrs mofford was sworn in the next 
day 
attorney general bob corbin defending acting secretary of state 
karen osborne in the suit contended last week that nothing in the 
constitution permits the cancellation of a recall election once it 
has been scheduled 
democrat carolyn warners lawyer also filed a brief monday 
urging that the election be called off mrs warner who had been 
campaigning for the job has said she will ask that her name be 
removed from the ballot if mrs mofford is allowed to run 
but republican candidates john rhodes and jack londen and 
independent john oertle sr filed papers saying the recall should 
be held because the people who signed petitions indicated they want 
to choose their next governor 
mechams spokesman norman martin said the former governor was 
not filing papers in the case however he said that if the court 
rules the recall must be held mecham expects to file suit in an 
effort to get his name reinstated on the ballot ms osborne last 
week removed mechams name after corbin said he is not entitled to 
run because he is no longer governor 
mrs moffords brief contended she should not have to face 
removal from office so soon after taking over the governorship 
governor mofford has not been impeached campbells brief 
said neither has anyone circulated petitions demanding her 
recall indeed no such petitions could be circulated because she 
has held office for only one wweek 
the constitution requires a public official to be in office for 
at least six months before a recall petition campaign can be 
started 
mrs moffords name was put on the ballot following a draft 
campaign and she has thus far avoided declaring her own candidacy 
for fear of running afoul of arizonas resign to run law 
mrs warners petition said the recall should be canceled 
because those individuals who signed recall petitions were 
specifically petitioning to recall the thengov evan mecham from 
office she also noted that if the recall were held and mrs 
mofford were beaten by another candidate she would not be entitled 
to return to her former position as secretary of state 
a petition filed by rhodes attorney said it would be an abuse 
of discretion for ms osborne to cancel the recall election 
londens brief said he already had spent more than 200000 for 
his candidacy on billboards television ads literature and staff 
oertles brief said that canceling the vote would violate his 
constitutional right to hold office

a conservative party leader criticized prince 
charles outspokenness on social issues saying the 39yearold 
future monarchs problem is hes never been allowed to take 
responsibility for anything 
norman tebbit former chairman of the governing party and seen 
as a potential successor to prime minister margaret thatcher said 
the prince sympathizes with the jobless for example because in 
a way hes got no job 
tebbit made the remarks during a british broadcasting corp 
documentary called charles prince of conscience broadcast 
monday which outlined the controversy surrounding the princes 
forthright comments and his reported dissatisfaction with a life of 
protocol and polo 
the monarch is constitutionally barred from political 
involvement and other members of the royal family traditionally 
refrain from commenting on politically sensitive topics 
the eldest son of queen elizabeth ii however often has spoken 
out about innercity decay conditions of the poor and jobless and 
architecture his stands on stimulating inner cities have 
reportedly differed from the governments and irritated mrs 
thatcher 
opposition labor party politicians criticized tebbits remarks 
as foolish saying they indicated mrs thatchers government 
was trying to stifle criticism 
two major newspapers in editorials monday based on 
prebroadcast reports of the interview also defended charles 
in the bbc program tebbit said charles outspoken comments 
would be dangerous only if he went too far if he advocated a 
socialist solution a labor party solution 
but when asked if he saw a risk in charles outspokenness 
tebbit said perhaps it is a sign of his own impatience with his 
own life which is very restrictive in what he can do and say 
now whether his judgment is always right or not well we all 
have our opinions about that said tebbit who left the cabinet 
to care for his wife mrs tebbit was severely injured a 1985 irish 
republican army bombing 
he said any criticism by charles of the world as it is 
sounds like a criticism of the government 
i suppose the prince of wales naturally feels extra sympathy 
towards those whove got no job tebbit said because in a way 
hes got no job and hes prohibited from having a job until he 
inherits the throne 
although approaching middle age the prince has not been able 
to take responsibility and authority for anything he said i 
think that is really his problem 
charles in a bbc interview last year said it would be easier 
to lead a quieter life but that he was driven to try to help 
the poor 
i dont need to do this but i feel strongly about a lot of 
these things and i cannot do nothing about it said charles who 
heads several programs to help the poor and disadvantaged youths 
on architecture charles called one planned museum addition a 
monstrous carbuncle and dubbed another planned building a glass 
stump in both cases the plans were scrapped 
while many have applauded charless criticisms some architects 
have complained that as a man who is neither elected nor possessed 
of any architectural qualifications he has no right to make such 
attacks 
most recently he rekindled controversy surrounding his position 
by telling journalists he was determined not to be confined to 
cutting ribbons the new york times reported in february 
palace officials have stoutly denied that the 62yearold queen 
will abdicate to allow her son to become king 
jack cunningham labor party spokesman on the environment 
called tebbits comments clearly foolish and almost offensive 
he said he believed the public wanted their future monarch to 
understand their problems and the prince is demonstrating a real 
concern for the people of this country 
opposition lawmaker bruce grocott accused tebbit of trying to 
silence such voices of opposition as trade unions and local 
government and it seems now he is trying to intimidate the 
monarchy as well 
public opinion polls have shown support for the princes action 
and some desire even more outspokenness a february survey in the 
mail a london newspaper found 57 percent of the 1086 adults 
asked said charles should spend most of his time speaking out on 
controversial subjects

a reputed mexican drug king was ordered held 
without bail on a 1980 narcotics indictment while an indictment 
charging another alleged trafficker with heading a worldwide drug 
cartel was unsealed 
jose contreras subias appeared before us magistrate joseph 
reichmann on monday on an 8yearold indictment for allegedly 
selling cocaine to undercover narcotics agents 
contreras subias who had been a fugitive since escaping from a 
mexican jail in 1985 was captured april 1 in salt lake city 
authorities believe contreras subias was the righthand man to 
alleged mexican drug lord rafael caro quintero jailed in mexico on 
charges of murdering us drug enforcement administration agent 
enrique camarena in 1985 
also monday juan ramon matta ballesteros 42 who authorities 
say ordered camarenas murder was named in a 14count indictment

cocaine into the united states via mexico between may 1983 and june 
1985 
matta ballesteros was arrested by us marshals last week after 
he was expelled from his native honduras the expulsion led to 
student riots in honduras that included setting fire to a us 
embassy annex there 
contreras subias told reichmann monday that federal authorities 
have the wrong man he claimed he is actually jose gonzalez 
guillen but prosecutors presented evidence that his fingerprints 
matched those taken during a 1985 arrest in los angeles 
he was scheduled to be arraigned in los angeles on monday 
prosecutors said 
nine people have been indicted in the camarena slaying and 
three are in custody said assistant us attorney jimmy gurule 
matta ballesteros is considered one of four prime suspects said

of pounds of south american cocaine to mexico the narcotics were 
then flown to a remote air strip in young ariz and moved in 
recreational vehicles to several safe houses in the los angeles 
area the indictment said 
the drug ring owned four airplanes rented homes in new york 
city and southern california and set up several corporations the 
indictment charged 
the indictment also accused matta ballesteros of conspiracy 
possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and running a 
continuing criminal enterprise

the afghan accord to be signed this week 
represents a rare victory for un diplomacy in resolving regional 
conflicts it also indicates the limitations of the world body 
the united nations only is as good as its 159 members only as 
constructive as they allow it to be only effective when the 
superpowers embrace it 
nearly six years of intensive intricate and innovative un 
diplomacy concerning the 10year afghan civil war finally paid off 
because it was in every partys interest there were 12 rounds of 
geneva talks and nine shuttle missions since 1981 
pakistan and afghanistan have announced agreement on a package 
of measures providing for the withdrawal of the estimated 115000 
soviet troops from afghanistan the marxist government of president 
najib has been backed by soviet soldiers in afghanistan since 1979 
the guerrilla forces are based in pakistan and armed primarily 
by the united states the moslem guerrillas who were not part of 
the unmediated talks have rejected the accords and said they 
will press their fight to oust the kabul government 
the united nations and its mediator diego cordovez played the 
role of catalyst and broker the negotiated accord is to be signed 
thursday in geneva 
a respected neutral peacekeeper worldwide the united nations 
will monitor the political settlement and soviet withdrawal 
lastminute disagreement between the united states and soviet 
union on cutting off aid to the guerrillas and the kabul government 
threatened to wreck the pact 
a behindthescenes agreement between the superpowers 
guarantors of the afghan accord cleared the way for success 
diplomatic sources said the two powers tacitly agreed to cut off 
aid to both sides or to provide an equal amount of supplies 
the fundamental obstacle was cleared when the soviet union 
decided that afghan intervention was too costly in money lives 
domestic politics and international image moscow then announced it 
would withdraw its troops over a 10month period begining may 15 
no amount of un diplomacy could achieve a breakthrough until 
the soviet union was ready to leave diplomats said 
diplomatic success is possible only when the moment is ripe 
said robert g neumann former us ambassador to afghanistan and 
now director of middle east studies at the center for strategic and 
international studies in washington dc but statesmen like 
ambassador cordovez have acted with great patience to ripen the 
time neumann said on monday in a telephone interview 
neumann envoy in kabul from 1966 to 1973 said the united 
nations had been hobbled because its charter prevents it from 
interfering in domestic affairs soviet insistence on a coalition 
government after its pullout had been an obstacle to political 
settlement 
when that stance was abandoned the united nations could act 
neumann said cordovez provided a catalyst as the principal but 
not the only actor since he was free to talk to all sides 
cordovez says the complicated afghan accord which includes five 
separate documents could serve as a model for resolving other 
regional conflicts 
the united nations faces numerous conflicts where its 
resolutions and diplomatic missions have had little or no effect 
the middle east the persian gulf lebanon central america 
vietnam and cyprus 
the un is extremely useful as a central point to carry on 
these kinds of negotiations but it takes a lot of force from the 
outside to succeed said a former senior un official familiar 
with the afghan talks 
the un has constructed a vehicle for peace in the hopes that 
someone will use it said the official speaking on condition his 
name not be used 
the negotiating process itself is very valuable and keeps the 
conflict from spinning out of control this honest broker is 
extremely important 
because pakistan and afghanistan have no relations their 
representatives refused to meet facetoface cordovez shuttled not 
only between capitals but between rooms where the delegations met 
he continually briefed the united states and soviet union and also 
met with afghan guerrillas 
before the final round of talks cordovez told reporters 
i am convinced that the parties to this accord especially the 
soviet union are signing because they want to it is in their 
selfinterest and for that reason they also should honor it 
the soviet union could stay in afghanistan and they are not 
going to be pushed out cordovez said but a military solution 
is not possible and the soviets have agreed to a political solution 
because they wish to

the larnaca airport control tower say their accents indicate that 
two are lebanese who recite from the koran islams holy book 
with iranian inflections and one is an iraqi 
there appears to be between five and seven arab hijackers 
bahrain authorities say the bahraini passports carried by five 
people in boarding the jumbo jetliner are forgeries 
what they want the hijackers main demand is the release of 17 
terrorists imprisoned in kuwait for bombing the us and french 
embassies there in 1983 this is the same demand made by the 
proiranian shiite moslem islamic jihad which is holding american 
and french hostages in lebanon all but one of the 17 terrorists in 
kuwait are shiite moslems three have been sentenced to death 
their links with lebanon two of the proiranian extremist

former president richard m nixon said today 
that only secret and prolonged negotiations can bring about a 
change in us relations with israel and that george shultzs 
efforts will go for nought in an election year 
you have to recongize that we can do nothing about those 
relations in an election year said nixon israel too is 
holding elections in 1988 
in the secnd of three consecutive daily appearances on nbcs 
today program nixon suggested that the united states use a 
heavyweight negotiator whom he did not name today but on sunday 
on nbcs meet the press he suggested henry kissinger for that 
role 
the former president who is making public appearances to 
promote a new book 1999 also touched on these subjects 
on others global responsibility unless the europeans do 
more in their own defense you are going to find the congress is 
going to reduce the american presence without getting anything for 
it from the russians 
on the next president he is going to be urged the moment 
he gets in to go running over to moscow or have them come here it 
would be the greatest mistake he can make nixon suggested the 
first summit meeting should be without glamour or spouses and 
should go on for at least two weeks and we should develop a 
common strategy 
on china chinas first priority is progress at home 
theyve given up on expansion and aggression abroad mikhail 
gorbachev has to choose if he can get progress at home and give 
away aggression abroad we can have the same relations with him 
that we do with the chinese 
nixon said he gives secretary of state shultz high marks for his 
shuttle diplomacy in the middle east in recent weeks but there 
isnt enough time to do it this year and it cannot be done in an 
election year i dont want to say its going to fail because hes 
going to continue to try but i say that 1989 is the optimum year 
to do it in 
the israelis said nixon should make their deal now because 
they are going to find that time is not on the side of the 
israelis 
asked what he thinks might restrain the sometimes brutal 
behavior toward arabs in the west bank and gaza nixon said 
they must not ignore the problem they must not be blind to 
the fact that there are a million and a half palestinians there who 
dont have the right of selfgovernment and thats a time bomb 
thats going to explode they have to deal with that or they are 
going to have great problems in the future

windhoek southwest africa ap in a stinging rebuke to 
president pw botha archbishop desmond tutu today denied that he 
endorsed marxism and said his fight against apartheid was deeply 
rooted in christian tradition 
tutu the first black to lead the anglican church in southern 
africa released the text of a letter to botha defending his 
challenges of government policy in a churchstate confrontation 
that has intensified over the past two months 
the nobel peace prize laureate was responding to a march letter 
from botha in which the south african president suggested tutu was 
furthering the cause of the african national congress guerrilla 
movement and promoting a marxist dictatorship 
botha whose letter was quoted at length on south african 
television asked whether tutu was acting on behalf of the 
kingdom of god or the kingdom promised by the anc 
replied tutu i work for gods kingdom for whose kingdom 
with your apartheid policy do you work for 
i reject atheistic marxism and i reject apartheid which i 
find equally abhorrent said tutu he cited numerous scriptural 
passages to support his contention that south africas policy of 
racial separation is unbiblical unchristian immoral and evil 
referring to insinuations in bothas letter tutu said he had 
never listened to the ancs radio broadcasts or read its magazine 
my theological position derives from the bible and the 
teachings of the church tutu wrote the bible and the church 
predate marxism and the anc by several centuries 
tutu is presiding this week over a synod of anglican bishops in 
southwest africa south africa administers the territory also 
known as namibia in violation of a un resolution 
tutu also offered to debate the morality of apartheid with a 
theologian from bothas dutch reformed church apartheid 
establishes a racially segregated society in which the 265 million 
blacks have no vote in national affairs but the 5 million whites 
control the economy and maintain separate districts schools and 
health services 
my position in this is not one of which i am ashamed i 
know that i stand in the mainline christian tradition he added 
botha had chided tutu for getting arrested along with 25 other 
church leaders when they tried to march on parliament six weeks 
ago to protest the bannings of 17 major antiapartheid 
organizations and more than a dozen individuals 
the clergymen have been trying to fill the political void 
created by the crackdown 
tutu who leaves saturday on a fiveweek trip to europe and the 
united states asked botha to ensure that his reply to the 
president was covered as prominently by state television as bothas 
march 16 letter to tutu he also accused the president of falsely 
claiming that tutu once preached under a communist banner 
i pray for you as i do for your ministerial colleagues every 
day by name tutus letter concluded god bless you

random house is planning to publish a modern 
english translation of the talmud that it hopes will make the 
1500yearold collection of jewish law legend and philosophy more 
accessible to laymen 
the translator is adin steinsaltz an orthodox rabbi and noted 
talmud scholar the project will be published in stages with the 
first three volumes expected by 1990 
steinsaltz of the israel institute for talmudic publications in 
jerusalem said the effort may entail as many as 15 volumes and 
take 10 years to complete 
peter osnos the random house associate publisher who will edit 
the project said the volumes will probably cost 30 to 40 each 
we have now possibly a major part of the jewish people whose 
native tongue is english steinsaltz said and who really are 
not comfortable in any other language 
the translation will be of the babylonian talmud compiled in 
the sixth century after christ and considered more authoritative 
than the shorter jerusalem or palestinian talmud 
the university of chicago press has published 22 of a projected 
36 volumes of the jerusalem talmud in english

the dalai lama the selfexiled leader of 
the tibetan people said today that tibetans remain in constant 
fear of the chinese government which rules their homeland 
however he said he is increasingly hopeful that a solution to 
the tibetan problem can be found 
many things are changing particularly in china things are 
changing for the better and generally speaking things are becoming 
more humanized that is a positive and hopeful sign the dalai 
lama told the global forum of spiritual and parliamentary leaders 
on human survival a gathering to discuss the planets problems 
the dalai lama is the spiritual and temporal leader of the 
tibetan people he fled tibet in 1959 after an aborted uprising 
against chinese rule 
china claims that tibet has been part of china for at least the 
past 700 years many tibetans claim that tibet is an independent 
state 
following a british stipulation the dalai lamas 30minute 
speech eschewed politics but when the 52yearold tibetan sat 
down a questioner asked whether the 200 conference participants 
could help in any way to stop the suffering and restore tibets 
religious and cultural freedom 
the dalai lama thanked the questioner and said he was continuing 
negotiations with china 
china boycotted the conference in oxford because of the dalai 
lamas presence in a letter to the times of london published 
tuesday chinese ambassador ji chaozhu defended his countrys rule 
of tibet 
the letter welcomed the dalai lamas intention to continue 
such contacts our only condition is that he does not demand 
independence for tibet which we would never accept 
the unique gathering of 200 personalities from more than 60 
countries is trying to find ways of using their influence with 
national decision makers to tackle international issues like 
nuclear war population control violence pollution and 
conservation 
in the first keynote speech at the opening ceremony monday in 
oxford city hall archbishop of canterbury robert runcie admitted 
that religious differences were still the root cause of tensions 
and deep divisions between different human groups 
it is premature to presume that the age of holy wars is long 
past said runcie spiritual head of the state church of england 
and leader of the worlds 70 million anglicans including 3 million 
us episcopalians 
james lovelock a british scientist concerned with saving the 
natural environment said in a main theme speech prepared for 
delivery today we face the hard task of reintegrating creation 
of learning again to be part of the earth and not separate from 
it 
lovelock who with lynn margulis formulated the gaia theory that 
earth itself is alive to the extent that it can regulate its 
climate and chemical composition said tropical forests which 
helped to create the rain that sustains them are being removed

land along las gallinas creek 
the city council is bruiting a ban on cats

birds another endangered species

a soviet foreign ministry official told italian 
parliamentarians today that 50000 soviet soldiers will be 
withdrawn from afghanistan within three months beginning may 15 an 
italian source said 
the statement by first deputy foreign minister yuli vorontsov 
appeared to be the first time an official source gave any 
indication of the size of the soviet force in afghanistan 
under an accord to be signed thursday in geneva the soviet 
union will agree to remove all of its soldiers from afghanistan 
within nine months of may 15 the first half of them by aug 15 
the figure provided by vorontsov would make the size of the 
soviet force about 100000 soldiers western sources have estimated 
there are 115000 soviet soldiers in afghanistan but the soviets 
never have provided a figure 
the italian source attended the meeting but spoke on condition 
he not be further identified 
vorontsov told the group of eight italian lawmakers that half of 
the soviet force would leave afghanistan within three months and 
he mentioned 50000 soldiers the source said 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfilyev speaking at a 
regular news briefing today said he could not give a figure for 
the number of soviet soldiers in afghanistan 
perfilyev indicated that soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze and us secretary of state george p shultz who will 
sign agreements to guarantee the geneva accord also may meet 
separately to discuss other issues 
shultz will be in moscow a week later to continue negotiations 
for a 50 percent cut in strategic nuclear weapons but it cant 
be ruled out that there will be a meeting dealing with a broad 
range of topics in geneva perfilyev said 
the italian delegation that met with vorontsov was headed by 
christian democrat flaminio piccoli president of the foreign 
commission of the italian chamber of deputies 
vorontsov did not provide any further details on the soviet 
forces in afghanistan but said that the soldiers would begin 
taking up positions to begin withdrawing in a month the italian 
source said 
vorontsov reportedly said nothing about the arming of prosoviet 
afghan government forces and afghan guerrillas who are supplied by 
the united states and other countries 
ussoviet disagreement over the future of that aid held up the 
geneva talks for several weeks before the two sides agreed that 
they could continue supplying weapons 
the united states had sought a symmetrical elimination of aid to 
government forces and the moslem guerrillas but the soviets 
refused to go along saying the united states interjected the 
demand at the last minute and that soviet union could not violate 
agreements with the afghan government 
soviet soldiers entered afghanistan in december 1979 and 
replaced one prosoviet government with another they remained to 
help government forces fight anticommunist insurgents many of 
whom have bases in neighboring pakistan 
the guerrillas have rejected the accords and said they will 
continue to fight to oust the kabul government

teams from several state and federal 
agencies searched today for a whale that swam about 70 miles up the 
delaware river attracting flocks of boaters despite warnings it 
could damage small craft 
the 40foot whale first reported by a tugboat crew was last 
seen just before nightfall monday at the delaware memorial bridge 
which crosses the delaware river about 25 miles south of 
philadelphia officials said 
personnel from delaware marine police us coast guard and the 
state department of natural resources went out in boats after 
daybreak to try to find and identify the marine mammal said 
kathleen jamison a public information officer with the natural 
resources department 
its such a gray day here that its not going to be easy to 
spot it ms jamison said 
the search crews hoped to guide the whale of undetermined 
species back out to sea she said 
the last time a live whale was seen so far up the heavily 
industrialized delaware was in 1890 said bob schoelkopf a 
nationally recognized whale expert who directs the marine mammal 
stranding center in brigantine nj 
it could be sick it could be an old animal dying it could 
have been hit by a boat and dazed schoelkopf said 
the coast guard was concerned both with the safety of the public 
and the whale which was just swimming around in circles said 
chief warrant officer dick foy in gloucester city nj 
a large freighter could kill the whale he said and if a 
pleasure boat got too close he could swish his tail and really 
pose a hazard to small craft well just try to entice it coax it 
herd it whatever you do with a whale to try to get him back to 
deep water where he belongs 
when we reached the wilmington terminal area it came up right 
in front of the boat said joyce hennessey a state marine police 
officer we have a 28foot boat and it was bigger than that i 
would estimate it at 40 feet 
the coast guard is recommending that recreational and private 
vessels exercise extreme caution in transitting the delaware river 
in the vicinity of the delaware memorial bridge due to the size and 
temperament of the whale said coast guard petty officer keith 
ferguson the whale could inflict serious damage to a small 
boater 
boaters however ignored warnings and flocked to the river to 
catch sight of the whale 
ive never seen anything like this before in all my life 
said dave boyd 
we saw him first at 430 he broke water and jumped in the 
air said gerry cichocki youll know when hes coming up 
youll hear him snort and spray then come up

foreigners including businessmen 
sailors and us troops must obtain certificates showing they are 
free of the aids virus before they can stay in the philippines the 
government said today 
the order which takes effect monday requires all merchant 
sailors to present aidsfree certificates regardless of how long 
they plan to remain in the philippines 
other foreigners must prove they are free of the virus if they 
want to stay longer than six months the department of foreign 
affairs said 
it added that details of the regulation covering us troops and 
dependents would be worked out in talks with american authorities 
foreigners admitted for less than six months must obtain 
aidsfree certificates from governmentapproved hospitals if they 
want to extend their stay the department added 
the regulation was issued in compliance with an order by the 
commission on immigration and deportation banning foreigners with 
loathsome or dangerous and contagious diseases 
immigration officials said the order was issued to prevent the 
spread of the deadly disease in a country where prostitution is 
widespread 
some health officials have criticized the plan as ineffective 
they say foreigners admitted for short periods could spread aids 
because they would not be required to prove they are free of the 
disease 
they also noted that foreigners could purchase forged 
certificates immigration commissioner miriam defensorsantiago 
said she did not include shortterm residents or tourists in the 
order because the move could lead to reprisals against filipino 
tourists by other nations 
according to the department of health more than 50 people in 
the philippines have been identified as carrying the aids virus but 
most have not shown symptoms of the disease 
most of the infected people have been bar girls working near 
us military bases 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the 
bodys immune system and makes the victim susceptible to cancers 
and other fatal ailments there is no cure 
the virus is primarily spread by sexual contact use of 
contaminated needles and transfusions of contaminated blood the 
disease can be transferred from an infected mother to her unborn 
child

crude oil prices advanced again this morning 
after a oneday jump incited by speculation that opec will 
orchestrate a broad effort to constrict world supplies though some 
analysts called the rise unsustainable 
on the new york mercantile exchange the maydelivery contract 
for west texas intermediate crude rose 4 cents per barrel to 1793 
early today after closing up 101 monday at 1789 the highest 
close since middecember 
refined products traded on the exchange were mixed after large 
advances monday wholesale heating oil fell 026 cent a gallon 
after rising 242 cents during the previous session to 4788 cents 
wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 10 cent a gallon to 5105 cents 
after a 218cent rise the previous session 
elsewhere several major us oil companies reacting to the 
jump in crude prices announced 50cent increases in the price they 
pay for west texas intermediate 
traders attributed the jumps to a weekend meeting of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries pricemonitoring 
committee which stated it would enlist help from nonopec 
producers to restrain output 
a oneday surge in crudeoil prices does not necessarily mean 
higher retail prices later but if the market sustains the 
increase some analysts say american consumers could be paying an 
additional 10 to 12 cents a gallon for gasoline by the peak of the 
summer season 
this is not a flash in the pan this is the beginning of a 
bull move said peter beutel assistant director of elders 
futures inc a new york energy futures trading concern the real 
story is the oil market cycle has turned its ready to go higher 
others discounted the move as a temporary spike in a market that 
remains basically unchanged they attributed it to misinformed 
speculation about opecs strategy and influence 
i see the opec thing as a fairly empty public relations 
gesture said carol epstein analyst at petroleum analysis ltd 
a new york consulting and publishing concern i dont see any 
fundamental turning around here 
ms epstein said her view was based partly on efforts by some 
opec members notably key producer saudi arabia to move into the 
refining or downstream end of the oil business this suggests 
opec itself believes the surplus of crude oil on world markets will 
persist which makes refining more attractive 
nevertheless some analysts said the move by the opec price 
monitoring committee was significant because the idea for 
cooperation was initiated by eight nonopec exporters 
emissaries from mexico china oman angola colombia egypt 
brunei and malaysia who met last month concluded that 
coordination with opec could help combat weak prices and excessive 
supplies 
theres momentum to have detente between opec and nonopec 
producers said daniel yergen president of cambridge energy 
research associates a petroleum market consulting company in 
cambridge mass this would be a major shift in that direction 
its bullish for higher prices 
opecs 13 members produce about 175 million barrels daily 
production from the nonopec exporters interested in cooperating 
with opec totals about 8 million barrels daily an agreement 
between them would affect production that accounts for more than 
half the consumption in the noncommunist world 
but skepticism persists that opec could engineer an agreement to 
restrain production among countries outside its jurisdiction some 
analysts emphasize that opec has faced difficulty enforcing 
internal discipline 
controlling production with 21 or so players isnt easy 
said stephen smith a petroleum analyst with bear stearns cos in 
new york keeping 13 guys in line is tough enough 
others said opecs previously failed efforts to maintain prices 
had erased much of the oncemighty cartels credibility suggesting 
its move to enlist support from nonopec exporters also was doomed 
my attitude has been talk is cheap with that crowd said 
john odea manager of international energy futures at dean witter 
reynolds inc in new york i think in the final analysis they 
have to produce some viable kind of agreement and they havent 
been able to do it for the past year why should they do it now

prosecutors have rejected about half the 
cases brought so far following a giant weekend police sweep against 
gangs saying there is not enough evidence to proceed in court 
two nights of dusktodawn patrols last weekend by about 1000 
officers resulted in 1453 arrests officer joe mariani said 
charges have been filed so far in 32 of 60 cases taken to the 
los angeles county district attorneys office said deputy district 
attorney stephen kay the other 28 were rejected because of lack of 
evidence he said 
city attorneys spokesman mike qualls said half of the 41 cases 
taken to his agency were rejected because of insufficient evidence 
felony cases are normally prosecuted by the county while the city 
attorney takes misdemeanors 
other cases still must be reviewed 
police chief daryl gates called for the show of force after a 
rash of gangrelated shootings including a driveby attack good 
friday that killed one man and wounded a dozen other people 
the weekend sweep dubbed fly the flag won praise from most 
quarters but three people whose house was allegedly ransacked by 
police serving a search warrant called the show of force 
heavyhanded 
there were 387 gangrelated murders in los angeles county last 
year and more than 85 such homicides have been reported so far this 
year 
more than half of those arrested or 794 were alleged gang 
members mariani said offenses ranged from 171 arrested for 
investigation of drug peddling to 138 allegedly driving under the 
influence of alcohol of drugs he said 
we accomplished what we set out to do namely letting gangs 
know we mean to put them out of business said police spokeswoman 
margie reed but we arent saying when well hit again we dont 
particularly like to let them know were coming like we did this 
time 
gates urged officers to get tough with gang members while 
showing restraint in dealing with others living in gangdominated 
neighborhoods 
but two men and a pregnant woman said officers serving a search 
warrant sunday ransacked their home beat them and forced to lie on 
the floor while handcuffed 
i was just getting ready to watch the laker game on tv when i 
heard them kick in the front door and start breaking windows 
said oc baker 34 they strapped a plastic loop on my wrists 
real tight made me get down on the foor and kicked me in the 
ribs 
the plainclothes officers put guns to the heads of the three 
adults and repeatedly swore at them to obey orders baker said 
police lt dave hepburn who led the raid said a previous 
undercover drug purchase at the house prompted the raid but no 
drugs were found 
despite the citywide gang crackdown four people were killed in 
driveby shootings over the weekend and nine other people were 
injured in a similar attack in willowbrook authorities said

street was named best actor at monday nights 60thannual

category in which it was nominated including screenplay 
adaptation costumes original score art direction 
cinematography sound editing and the directing award to acclaimed

as an italian as a european the academy awards has always 
seemed to me like a distant ceremony said bertolucci 
something fascinating remote something i really didnt belong 
to then one day the last emperor got nine nominations and 
everything changed immediately 
the director who surprised the industry by winning permission 
from the chinese government to film a story with political 
overtones within beijings fabled forbidden city offered a 
chinese kowtow to the academy saying this is one of the 
strongest emotions of my life and i cant hide it 
the movies nine oscars marked the biggest haul since west 
side story took 10 in 1962 the alltime champ ben hur won 11 
in 1960 
moonstruck took three oscars but the critically acclaimed 
hope and glory and crowdpleasers good morning vietnam and 
broadcast news struck out despite having five one and seven 
nominations respectively

gentlemen friends and a few enemies 
connery said he assumed his award was for an accumulation of 
my different performances 
he also made a plea for an end to the 5weekold writers guild 
of america strike that caused some clumsiness in the script for the 
ceremony which is normally written by some of hollywoods best 
wordsmiths 
the award for song went to the time of my life from dirty 
dancing and the movies stars patrick swayze and jennifer grey 
appeared as presenters 
in a ceremony that rewards dramatic expertise there were many 
lumpinthe throat moments among them deaf actress marlee matlins 
presentation of the best actor oscar to douglas miss matlin who 
won last year as best actress abruptly abandoned her sign language 
to speak haltingly as she announced the nominees and exclaimed an 
exuberant good morning vietnam when she reached robin

caused logistical problems including a monumental traffic jam that 
forced some stars to leave their limousines and walk rather than 
miss the ceremonies best actress nominees meryl streep and glenn

companies using ozonedestroying chemicals to 
make plastic foam food packaging will switch to other compounds by 
the end of the year their trade association said today 
while such use accounts for only 15 percent to 2 percent of the 
us production of the chemicals in question chlorofluorocarbons 
or cfcs some environmentalists have targeted food packages as a 
highly visible and unessential use of the cfcs 
the environmentalists already had won pledges from fast food 
chains not to use cfcmade products 
about onethird of foam packages things like egg cartons and 
clamshell hamburger containers are made with cfcs said joseph 
bow president of the trade group the foodservice and packaging 
institute at a news conference 
most of the rest are manufactured with other compounds such as 
pentane but the cfcs in question are expected to be replaced by 
the 15 companies using them with a related compound called hcfc22 
the program is voluntary on the part of the companies but bow 
said none was expected to refuse to participate 
the replacement compound has only about 5 percent of the 
ozonedestroying potential of the cfcs it replaces jeffrey eves a 
vice president of the fort howard co the largest user of cfcs in 
making food packages said the cost of using the replacement would 
be about even with the old compounds 
three major environmental groups friends of the earth the 
environmental defense fund and the natural resources defense 
council praised the action and said they would join the institute 
in monitoring hcfc22 use and seeking an entirely benign 
replacement 
they also will use the action in pressuring companies with other 
cfc uses to find alternatives said david doniger an attorney for 
the natural resources defense council 
it doesnt solve all the problems posed by plastic packaging 
plastic packaging still poses a trash problem nevertheless the 
industry deserves support said doniger 
ozone at high altitudes protects the earth from the suns 
cancercausing ultraviolet rays but can be destroyed by chlorine 
liberated from the breakup of cfc compounds at those altitudes 
hcfc22 breaks up much lower down in the atmosphere 
last month the national aeronautics and space administration 
reported that cfcs appear to have been responsible for an average 
23 percent decline in the ozone shield at northern hemisphere 
midlatitudes from 1969 to 1986 
a treaty signed by 31 nations last fall requires a 50 percent 
cut in cfc production by 1998

the utah department of health has 
protested a plan to build a laboratory at dugway proving ground 
that would be capable of testing bacteria and viruses for which 
there are no known cures or vaccines 
the department also said monday that the armys draft 
environmental study on the biological test facility has serious 
deficiencies 
gov norm bangerter and some members of utahs congressional 
delegation also oppose the armys proposed 54 million biological 
aerosol test facility 
the lab would have the highest level of containment possible 
known as biosafety level 4 
the army said it does not plan to conduct tests requiring bl4 
containment but it has not ruled out such tests in the future 
dr suzanne dandoy executive director of the health department 
said the draft environmental study is totally inadequate in 
justifying the need or addressing the impacts of a biological 
levelfour facility 
we are opposed to the construction of a bl4 facility because 
there is no justification of need nor information that demonstrates 
that the public could be protected dandoy said in a letter 
monday to dugways commander col james tipton 
dandoy recommended that a citizen advisory board of state and 
national experts be created to evaluate the need for and potential 
risks associated with a bl4 facility

jetliner after it was forced to land in northeastern iran but 
kuwait rejected the offer iranian deputy foreign minister javad

said iran had no alternative but to refuel the aircraft and allow 
it to leave mashhad on friday it later landed at larnaca cyprus 
he said the kuwaiti authorities rejected the iranian offer to 
storm the boeing 747 saying they are not going to take 
responsibility for the outcome of that operation

and we were afraid that the airplane would be blown up so we were 
forced to refuel it it was against our wish but this was the only 
thing we could do

a reporter for the philadelphia inquirer whose 
pulitzer prize was challenged by a magazine that ran a similar 
story says he had no doubt his award would be upheld 
the pulitzer boards executive committee said monday it saw no 
reason to question the award to tim weiner who won the national 
reporting prize for a 1987 series on the defense departments 
black budget for secret projects 
the national journal last week asked the board to reconsider the 
inquirers prize 
the washingtonbased weekly magazine said weiners series was 
a blatant and egregious case of building a news story according 
to someone elses blueprint namely the magazines march 1 
1986 cover story about the black budget it contended that 
weiners story broke no new ground 
in philadelphia on monday weiner called the national journals 
challenge a false charge and a phony controversy 
i never had any doubts it would be resolved this way he 
said its been very instructive being on the other end of the 
telescope 
the committees decision shows its members are able to cut 
through baloney when they see it said james m naughton the 
inquirers deputy managing editor 
we appreciate the promptness with which the pulitzer board 
acted on our request for a review national journal publisher 
john fox sullivan said in a statement we raised the issue of 
recycled journalism in good faith and now consider the current 
matter closed 
the pulitzer board said in a statement that after careful 
consideration of the journals objections the executive committee 
found no reason to question the award 
three committee members met in new york on monday and two joined 
in on the phone from washington said board secretary robert 
christopher 
it was relatively brief and there wasnt any disagreement 
christopher said everybody was in accord on what should be done 
or should not be done 
the statement said the decision was reached by unanimous vote of 
the five executive committee members participating he said two 
members inquirer executive editor eugene roberts and david 
laventhol president of the times mirror co which owns the 
national journal did not take part 
those taking part included christopher roger w wilkins senior 
fellow at the washingtonbased institute for policy studies james 
f hoge jr publisher of the new york daily news charlotte 
saikowski washington bureau chief of the christian science 
monitor and columbia university president michael i sovern 
christopher said last week that prizewinning stories dont have 
to break new ground but only represent a distinguished example 
of reporting on national affairs 
our object was to publish the most complete thorough 
readable account of the black budget ever done and we are 
convinced we did it said roberts 
the inquirer said weiner broke new ground with his analysis of 
the defense department budget concluding that the department had 
35 billion in hidden programs 
weiner said he interviewed more than 100 people across the 
nation and was kneedeep in his work before he saw the 
journals story

democrats michael dukakis and albert gore jr tangled in a 
sometimes contentious debate in new york today while rival jesse 
jackson declared he was no longer the underdog but one of the top 
dogs and i just love it 
gore and dukakis engaged in exchanges over the middle east 
welfare and their own presidential race and the massachusetts 
governor upbraided the tennessee senator for attacking him as too 
soft on jackson 
dukakis the frontrunner said he would compete for delegates 
won by other candidates who have left the race and even maybe for 
al gores delegates 
dont lick your chops too soon governor dukakis gore shot 
back new yorks going to have a bigger say about that than you 
will 
the debate came one week before the new york primary with 255 
delegates at stake and was the first fullscale democratic debate 
since last months super tuesday campaign 
elsewhere in the empire state vice president george bush told a 
100aplate republican breakfast in schenectady today that despite 
his virtual lock on the gop nomination i still intend to 
campaign right through the end of the primary season 
i cant wait to take on whichever one of those three democrats 
wins the democratic nomination he said 
gore in the 90minute democratic debate claimed for himself 
the role of underdog a position supported by his standing in the 
polls but jackson whose candidacy has moved from a symbolic one 
four years ago to a contending one this year said new york doesnt 
necessarily favor the underdog 
i was an underdog for 45 years and 11 months and now im one 
of the top dogs and i just love it jackson said new york 
loves a winner and im a winner 
the democrats debate reflected the new york primarys focus on 
middle east issues 
gore cited disagreements with both jackson and dukakis on the 
issue of an independent state for palestinians saying dukakis had 
sounded a note of enthusiasm about such a prospect he said he 
disagreed with the way jesse jackson advocates a palestinian 
state 
gore trailing far behind his two rivals in polls in new york 
also said that dukakis the massachusetts governor recently 
recommended very very deep cuts in aid to welfare recipients 
and poor families as part of his new budget for massachusetts 
thats absolutely incorrect dukakis shot back youre 
wrong youre wrong 
the candidates met in an 90minute debate in new yorks felt 
forum the event sponsored by the new york daily news 
jackson who has drawn opposition from some jewish leaders said 
mutual recognition and security were goals in the occupied 
territories in the middle east while we can guarantee secure 
borders we cannot ensure tranquility so long as there is 
occupation he said 
gore calling the issue politically charged then said he 
had disagreements with jackson and dukakis 
dukakis said i think we can disagree without suggesting 
anyone is attacking anyone and al i think i heard you correctly 
when you were attacking me for not attacking jesse thats the 
first time thats happened in 25 years 
gore responded what i said was you were timid in not being 
willing to say why you believed you would make a better president 
than jesse jackson 
dukakis shot back no you said i was timid because i would 
not attack this man first time thats happend 
i didnt express enthusiasm for a palestinian state 
yesterday dukakis added i expressed enthusiasm for 
presidential leadership to persuade arab leaders to finally stand 
up and say they were prepared to commit themsevlves to saying 
israel has a right to exist 
monday night a little hollywood glitter rubbed off dukakis 
campaign as his cousin picked up an academy award 
ok michael lets go olympia dukakis called as she 
accepted her oscar for best supporting actress for her performance 
in the comedy moonstruck dukakis at a restaurant in new york 
that figured in the film called his cousin to congratulate her 
and said her triumph may be a sign of good things to come in new 
york 
bush touring an ibm plant in thornwood ny on monday called 
himself a good friend of israel and said american jews should 
vote for him and not a democrat 
dukakis speaking to jewish leaders said arab leaders are 
responsible for the violence in the israelioccupied territories 
he said neither the young stonethrowers nor the israeli government 
bear the blame 
jackson in a delicate position because he made comments in 1984 
that offended many jews continued to put distance between himself 
and palestine liberation organization chief yasser arafat with 
whom he once met 
jackson called the plo leader one of the most extreme 
elements in the conflict and urged jewish and arabamericans to 
hold talks themselves in an effort to find common ground 
his comment about arafat drew the ire of some arabamericans 
abdeen jabara president of the americanarab antidiscrimination 
committee sent a letter to jackson complaining your comments 
in new york have the appearance of tailoring your positions on 
critical issues to suit the narrow political views of powerful 
special interests 
gore on monday continued to stress his support for israel 
adding it would be possible to test some sort of limited autonomy 
for palestinians on the west bank but he said any such formula 
would have to include assurances of security for israel 
gore has been lagging behind dukakis and jackson in polls of new 
york voters as well as the national delegate count the latest ap 
count puts dukakis at 74505 jackson at 70955 gore at 3958 and 
uncommitted 51435 to nominate 2082 delegates are needed

president reagans wealthy friends who are 
buying a california estate for him to occupy probably could give it 
to him without violating conflictofinterest laws according to 
the office of government ethics 
the opinion confirms that industrialists holmes tuttle and earle 
jorgensen are among the 20 or so businessmen who purchased a 25 
million home for the reagans to live in when they leave the white 
house next year 
the july 31 1986 letter was written in response to a request 
from private attorneys who wanted to determine whether the 
arrangement would be ethically appropriate it was made available 
to the associated press today by a washington law firm 
the reagans began paying rent under a threeyear lease which 
took effect march 1 with an option to buy the house eventually the 
white house says reagan and his wife nancy will pay fairmarket 
rent for the property 
the opinion letter notes that criminal conflictofinterest laws 
dont apply to the president 
it says standards of conduct for the executive office of the 
president restrict an employees acceptance of any gift from a 
person who is doing business with the employees agency 
however the letter notes that an employee may accept a gift 
from a friend when the circumstances make it clear that the 
personal relationship is the motivating factor 
if your proposal was viewed as a favor or as something of 
monetary value there would be an exception that would permit the 
president to accept it said the letter by david martin the 
ethics offices former director 
the letter was requested by washington lawyers representing wall 
management services inc the company in which the reagans friends 
bought stock in order to raise the capital to buy the home for the 
reagans in 1986 
in a july 21 1986 request to the ethics office marked 
confidential the lawyers for wall management services said 
that a group of about 18 financially independent friends of the 
reagans proposed to buy and renovate the bel air home in an 
interview monday night wall managements chief financial officer 
ira revich said approximately 20 friends of the reagans had 
bought stock in the company 
the 1986 request didnt identify the businessmen and revich 
refused to name them under california law companies incorporated 
in that state dont have to identify stockholders 
tuttle and jorgensen are listed as directors and the 1986 
request to the ethics office describes their business activities 
and says they are stockholders 
the confidential request says that at least one of the 
investors had loaned money to the presidents inaugural committee 
and that about six had given the president or the first lady gifts 
in the previous six years a number of the investors had served as 
informal nongovernment advisers to the president but he has 
appointed some of them or their spouses or relatives to various 
commissions or federal posts said the request 
in an interview martin said he recalled that the ethics office 
had gotten the names of the investors after requesting them and 
that the office went through the whole conflicts of interest 
analysis 
the house is in the bel air section of los angeles about 12 
miles northwest of downtown los angeles and near the university of 
california it has three bedrooms and six bathrooms a formal 
living room a family room a sun room a butlers pantry and three 
servants rooms

farmers and ranchers cannot use strychnine 
above ground to control rodents and other pests if the poison would 
threaten protected wildlife a federal judge has ruled 
us district judge diana murphy said monday the environmental 
protection agency violated federal law in registering strychnine 
for aboveground pest control 
the ruling affects 62 species and subspecies of animals that are 
protected under federal law including grizzly bears salt marsh 
harvest mice canada geese wolves owls hawks california condors 
and bald and golden eagles 
it is the most broadranging opinion ever issued under the 
endangered species act both in the number of different animals it 
protects and the fact that it protects them almost across the 
entire united states said brian oneill a lawyer for three 
environmental groups that filed suit 
murphy said federal regulations require strychninelaced baits 
be set so that only targeted animals are likly to eat the poison 
however she noted strychnine is nonselective it kills 
anything which ingests a lethal dose mortality can occur to both 
target and nontarget species 
up to 500000 pounds of strychninelaced bait is used annually 
to kill pests such as prairie dogs ground squirrels meadow mice 
and nuisance birds that eat farm crops according to court 
documents the poison is used mainly in the west but also in some 
eastern states 
murphy said her injunction will remain in effect indefinitely 
unless the epa can demonstrate how it might allow use of the poison 
and still prevent the incidental deaths of protected wildlife 
murphy said the epa violated the endangered species act the 
migratory bird treaty act and the bald and golden eagle protection 
act in registering strychnine 
the decision did not specify geographical limits for the ban 
but said the poison cannot be used anywhere it would threaten an 
protected wildlife some protected species such as canada geese 
cover wide areas in their annual migrations 
charles shochey a justice department lawyer who represented the 
epa in the case said monday that he had not seen murphys decision 
and could not comment 
the lawsuit was filed against the epa in august 1986 by the 
sierra club defenders of wildlife and friends of animals and 
their environment 
the american farm bureau federation which represents more than 
3 million farmers and ranchers joined the case in support of the 
epa 
the environmentalists said that at least 24 states reported 
posioning of protected wildlife that had either eaten 
strychninelaced bait or the remains of other animals exposed to 
the bait 
documents given murphy showed five condors six peregrine 
falcons 15 golden eagles 31 bald eagles and 724 other birds and 
mammals had died after eating the bait 
in minnesota there were documented reports of deaths from 
strychnine poisoning from 1978 to 1983 involving mallard ducks 
snowy owls a redtailed hawk a gyrfalcon and a bald eagle the 
environmental groups said

wherever greekamericans have settled across the land they have 
settled on michael dukakis son of greek immigrants as their 
presidential candidate 
i think its wonderful a greek has come up this far said 
alexandra matheos a 62yearold retired luncheonette owner as she 
stood inside st basils after an easter service it means a lot 
to all ethnics when we were kids we never thought wed live to see 
a greek nominated 
dukakis candidacy for the democratic presidential nomination 
has caused a surge of excitement among those who came to america 
from greece like dukakis parents and among their 
firstgeneration children 
about 25 percent of the 15 million dukakis has raised in 
campaign contributions came from the greekamerican community 
believed to number about 1 million 
a lot about the dukakis candidacy stimulates 
greekamericans says elias vlanton information director of the 
american hellenic educational progressive association he invokes 
his greek heritage and the values that greeks hold dear love of 
family the need and importance of public service 
among the people of greek origin in troy a melting pot city of 
56000 overlooking the hudson river famous for its hot dogs and as 
the place where collars for arrow shirts were once made dukakis 
looms as large as the local legend samuel wilson 
wilson buried in troy cemetery was a meatpacker and patriot 
who supplied american troops during the war of 1812 with barrels of 
beef stamped with the letters us to identify them as property 
of the government he became known as uncle sam namesake of 
the patriotic symbol 
leaving st basils the other day roula aletrakis 53yearold 
native of greece was taken aback at the suggestion that she might 
vote for anyone other than dukakis 
sure yes were greek people she said when a visitor asked 
if she was voting for dukakis 
ive always voted republican but this time im voting 
democrat said her husband tony 66 a retired woodworker 
in new yorks primary on tuesday greekamerican voters are 
rallying to dukakis just as they have in earlier primary states 
even greekamericans who are republican assume that dukakis will 
be the democratic candidate and are ready to bolt the gop for their 
kinsman in november 
im republican said nick zembekis 50 a greek native who 
works at chriscraft industrial products inc sure im voting 
for dukakis because im greek thats why thats all if im not 
greek i dont vote for dukakis 
sitting on a stool next to zembekis in the famous lunch his 
friend john oureilidis a 40yearold bowling equipment supplier 
backed him up 
dukakis all the way said oureilidis i believe the things 
he says plus hes greek he talks sense nobody talks about poor 
people like he does i believe he can do it hes our boy so we 
have to vote for him 
occasionally there is a dissenter like nikolaos adamou 37 a 
native of greece and an economics teacher at rensselaer polytechnic 
institute who is a supporter of jesse jackson 
jackson is going to protect american interests more 
effectively in third world countries he said i like dukakis 
hes greek nothing personally 
just the same there is an outpouring of pride in dukakis 
especialy among older greekamericans 
i think theyve been very supportive and very important to the 
campaign says paul brountas dukakis national campaign chairman 
and a greekamerican himself whose ties to the massachusetts 
governor go back to their college days 
the thing you have to remember is that in the early stages of 
his campaign there were two principal sources of contributions one 
was a very strong base of support in massachusetts the second 
point was the greek support 
the rev emmanuel mantzouris pastor of st basils which has 
about 250 greekamericans in its congregation said i think a 
lot of greeks are very politically oriented just knowing hes 
greek draws their attention somebody being greek in the 
limelight

girls are not getting their fair share of 
national merit scholarships and would win more of the awards if 
high school grades as well as test scores were counted a group 
critical of standardized tests said tuesday 
boys generally outscore girls on the qualifying test to become 
national merit semifinalists just as they do on the scholastic 
aptitude test and other standardized exams 
but fairtest a group also known as the national center for fair 
amp open testing said girls perform better in class than boys it 
said high school grades should count just as much as the test 
scores when the 15000 national merit semifinalists are chosen each 
year 
the sponsor the national merit scholarship corp said that 
would drive up the cost of administering the prestigious award 
program and reduce the amount available for scholarships 
sarah stockwell of fairtest called the national merit 
scholarship corps reliance on the preliminary scholastic aptitude 
test to select semifinalists extraordinarily irresponsible and 
said it costs women millions of dollars each year 
marianne roderick a senior vice president of the national merit 
scholarship corp in evanston ill said 63 percent of this years 
national merit semifinalists are boys 
it has been true over a number of years that boys outnumber 
girls by about 6040 sometimes a little more sometimes a little 
less she said 
she defended the use of the standardized test to select 
semifinalists the merit program is open to more than a million 
youngsters who enter it each year and we have no quotas regarding 
boys or girls or ethnic origin or anything else 
using the test is the best method we have found to date to 
make entry to the program available at a relatively nominal 
fee she said adding that switching to some other method of 
selection would drive up administrative costs 
once the 15000 semifinalists are chosen the national merit 
scholarship corp does look at their high school grades 
extracurricular activities and achievements in whittling the field 
down to 6000 winners who receive scholarships ranging from 250 to 
8000 
last year among the 6146 who got scholarships 62 percent were 
boys and 38 percent were girls roderick said 
the activist group said it also suspects that minorities are 
underrepresented among the ranks of the national merit winners 
despite special awards earmarked for black students 
the organization sponsors a separate national achievement 
scholarship program for outstanding negro students that awards 
about 700 scholarships annually but roderick said it does not 
collect ethnic data from other contestants 
many colleges vie in recruiting national merit winners and some 
fund their own scholarships through the national merit program 
corporations and the national merit scholarship corp itself 
provide the other scholarships 
the preliminary scholastic aptitude test also called the 
national merit scholarship qualifying test is essentially the same 
as the scholastic aptitude test although it is scored on a 
different scale in selecting semifinalists the verbal score 
counts twice as much as the math score 
the overall qualifying score varies from state to state 
onehalf of one percent of each states graduating seniors are 
chosen 
last year when the national average for the class of 1987 was 
906 boys averaged 935 and girls 878 
the cambridge massbased fairtest said the tests multiple 
choice format seems to favor boys because research suggests they 
are more adept at guessing and male characters are featured more 
often in test questions than females making the questions more 
maleoriented 
fairtest also said sat scores underpredict womens actual grades 
in college 
fred moreno a spokesman for the college board in new york 
which sponsors the psat and sat said that charge is based on a 
college board research report which found women did a little bit 
better in college than predicted by their combined sats and 
grades 
but the difference is very very small said moreno the 
actual grades of the women studied were fourhundredths of one 
point higher than predicted he said theres no proof that the 
test is biased

workmen cleaning the dusty tomb of ramses 
iis beautiful queen nefertari found a fragment of beaten gold 
jewelry that grave robbers and tourists apparently overlooked for 
3250 years 
resins clinging to the etched fragment indicate it may have been 
attached originally to her missing mummy egyptian and american 
officials said tuesday in announcing the find 
if the fragment is determined to have belonged to the queen it 
would be rare indeed the only other surviving legacy of nefertari 
is the lid of her sarcophagus on exhibit at the turin egyptian 
museum in italy 
egyptian culture minister farouk hosni called the jewelry which 
is 1 inches long and an inch wide a significant discovery 
only the second object ever found that probably belonged to 
nefertari 
the piece resembles segments of armlets or bracelets surviving 
from ramses new kingdom era with golden pieces linked by chains 
and beads and decorated with flowers 
the fragile gold sheet was in an anteroom behind the queens 
burial chamber found during a project to stop the decay of 
nefertaris tomb in southern egypts valley of the queens 
sponsored by the egyptian antiquities organization and the getty 
conservation institute of marina del rey calif the project began 
18 months ago and is expected to last another 3 years 
with its splendid vividly colored wall paintings nefertaris is 
the greatest among 80 tombs in shallow valleys called the place 
of beauty royal wives and children were buried there in rockcut 
tombs opposite the ancient capital thebes now called luxor 450 
miles south of cairo 
luis monreal the getty institutes director said nobody 
believed anything of significance had escaped the attention of 
grave robbers or the thousands of tourists and conservators who 
visited the tomb since its discovery in 1904 
workmen inching across the floor of the tombs final chamber 
clearing away the centuries of dust by hand found the fragment on 
feb 8 monreal said 
it lay covered by dust then by broken bits of wall paintings 
which in themselves were covered by layers of dust he said 
another real bonus that we hadnt expected is that we 
recovered pieces of a complete segment of wall painting which 
will cover some 10 square feet when we reattach it to the rear 
wall he said 
although proof hasnt been found that the fragment was 
nefertaris there are indications including its hieroglyphic 
inscriptions monreal said 
los angelesbased british egyptologist helen strudwick who 
studied the piece for getty found significance in the ritual 
inscription true of voice a phrase ancient egyptians normally 
used after the name of the person who died 
she noted that the phrase had a feminine ending that plus the 
fragments discovery inside nefertaris tomb highly suggests 
that it was from the queens burial paraphernalia perhaps even 
torn from her mummified body 
the piece does not rank with the tutankhamun treasure in 
esthetic terms but it still has historical and sentimental value 
because the powerful nefertari simply vanished monreal said 
nefertari the beautiful and bold wife of warriorhero ramses 
ii is thought to have died about age 45 about 3250 years ago her 
tomb paintings and inscriptions depict her as a woman of great 
charm and exquisite taste adorned with magnificent jewelry and 
wearing fashionable gowns 
ramses favorite of 13 wives nefertari accompanied her husband 
in battle and helped negotiate the worlds first peace treaty 
ramses agreement with the troublesome hittites of asia minor in 
her famous temple at abu simbel nefertari is pictured begging 
ramses to be gentle with his captives 
nefertari was the worlds first first lady monreal said 
she was last seen accompanying her husband to consecrate the two 
temples at abu simbel in 1255 bc then we know nothing of her 
maybe this piece will tell us about her death

a former massachusetts institute of technology 
scientist testified today that he knew of fraud taking place in 
research at the institute but was reluctant to report it because he 
feared retribution 
dr charles maplethorpe who was conducting postdoctoral 
research at mit said he learned of what he considered fraudulent 
research by thereza imanishikari but was reluctant to report it 
until just before receiving his degree 
dr maplethorpe said he told an mit official that he suspected 
fraud and the officials only action was to give him a form to fill 
out 
i felt there was no question that if i made a formal charge of 
fraud it would not be taken seriously and i would be the person 
worst off for it he said 
appearing today under subpoena before the house energy and 
commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations maplethorpe 
said he was very reluctant to present the testimony and would not 
be there except for the legal compulsion 
there is a tremendous disincentive to come forward and once 
they come forward the instigators will pay a price he said 
the testimony came during hearings on practices of fraud in the 
governments 5billion biomedical research program 
in testimony before another subcommittee yesterday walter w 
stewart and dr ned feder two national institutes of health 
scientists said they have received unfavorable job ratings since 
they have acted as whistleblowers about false research data 
reported by nih grant recipients 
stewart and feder said they began investigating allegations of 
misconduct by grant recipients about four years ago 
although nih officially allows them to spend 20 percent of their 
time investigating scientific fraud stewart said he discovered in 
1985 that his laboratory equipment at the national institute of 
diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases had been removed and 
junked without notice 
stewart and feder whose work had always been judged 
satisfactory said they began getting unfavorable job evaluations 
which were reversed on appeal 
stewart said their troubles clearly stemmed from their inquiries 
into fraudulent practices by nih grant recipients 
another whistleblower who complained of mistreatment was dr 
jerome g jacobstein who said i have been ignored by my friends 
vilified by my enemies despised hated condemned and on a rare 
but satisfying occasion perhaps respected 
jacobstein alleged that dr jeffrey s borer a cardiologist and 
cornell university medical college professor attempted to induce a 
student to make numerous misrepresentations in a joint scientific 
study report he said borer ultimately got away with a mild rebuke 
jacobstein estimated that although extreme forms of research 
fraud such as wholesale fabrication of data were fairly rare 
an estimated 20 percent to 30 percent of research studies supported 
by nih grants contained unethically flawed data 
a scientist who cheats injures other scientists by misleading 
them and he injures the public by wasting their money and 
sometimes by falsely claiming discoveries that directly affect the 
public health and welfare stewart and feder said monday in a 
joint statement to the subcommittee 
rep ted weiss dny chairman of the house government 
operations panel expressed sympathy for a suggestion by rep john 
conyers dmich that congress should approve criminal penalties 
for scientific fraud or misconduct because of its threat of 
incredible harm and injury to the public 
the whistleblowers who also included professor robert l 
sprague of the university of illinois at urbanachampaign 
complained that criminal penalties would be excessively harsh and 
might create a damaging climate of fear among scientists 
the witnesses all expressed hope that the scientific community 
might find a way to improve internal safeguards against research 
abuses but weiss said no one neither the nih the universities 
receiving research grants nor professional scientific societies 
had shown willingness to solve the fraud problem

police chief billy prince under fire from top 
city officials for criticizing city council members and opposing 
police reforms resigned today 
prince said he is stepping down immediately and city manager 
richard knight appointed first assistant police chief louie c 
caudell as interim chief police sgt carol eberhardt said 
i dont want to be a lameduck leader or a lameduck chief 
said prince he said he will serve in an advisory role through the 
summer 
prince who has been chief for six years said he is tired of 
the battling between the community and his beleaguered department 
i made this decision after an 11day vacation on easter 
sunday prince said at a news conference i woke up easter 
sunday and just didnt feel good about returning i told my wife 
then i think its time for me to go 
it wasnt one event that led to his decision but i would not 
be totally truthful if i said i liked the atmosphere weve been 
working under its very trying and it wears you down 
prince said he was not forced out of the 87000 peryear job 
and said he will now concentrate on business interests 
im 45 years old and i feel im at a part of my life when if 
im going to change nows the time to do it he said 
prince a 24year dallas police veteran has discussed his 
resignation with knight and other associates several times in the 
last few weeks officials said 
his resignation comes at a time of tension between police and 
the minority community he has been caught between the demands of a 
majority of the city council including mayor annette strauss who 
want more police accountability and the dallas police union which 
opposes greater control 
some minority community leaders including city councilwoman 
diane ragsdale and county commissioner john wiley price have 
called for princes dismissal 
city councilman jerry rucker said he was angered by the reports 
and called prince a scapegoat for the mayor and the city 
manager 
what a horrible thing for dallas rucker said i think 
its a tragedy for a man to be hounded out of his office by 
demagogues 
rucker who has considered running for mayor predicted princes 
resignation would be an issue in the 1989 municipal elections 
i think the people will finally say this is the last straw 
rucker said 
prince has been at odds with the city council since late last 
year when knight rebuked prince for lobbying against police 
reforms recommended by mrs strauss advisory committee on crime 
the aftermath of the jan 23 slaying of officer john glenn chase 
by a vagrant in downtown parking lot put prince on a collision 
course with the citys elected leadership 
prince said some city council members shared blame for chases 
death because they had created an atmosphere of hostility toward 
police 
mrs strauss asked prince to retract his statements which she 
said heightened racial tensions but he refused to back down

for those who wont wait until death do them part 
divorce counselor sheila davis has a word or two to ease hard 
feelings 
she asks divorcing couples to join hands and tell each other 
something like goodbye thank you for the good times in our 
marriage i wish you luck in your new life our relationship will 
continue as mother and father of our children but not as husband 
and wife 
mrs davis works for the city of birmingham as a divorce courts 
welfare lawyer divorced and remarried herself she says she 
pioneered her ritual from personal experience 
the wording of the farewell varies depending on the 
personalities involved but the general idea is to help divorcing 
parents come to terms with the split and be nice to each other 
especially when waging child custody battles 
with 168100 marital breakups in 1986 or three per 1000 
people britain has the highest rate of divorce in western europe 
experts say onethird of british marriages are doomed to fail 
britains tough marital law was reformed in 1971 changing 
grounds for divorce from marital misconduct to irretrievable 
breakdown the divorce rate soared again after 1984 when the 
waiting period for a divorce was reduced from three years to one 
in britain communities provide free counseling to couples in 
the throes of divorce mrs davis said she and 19 other advisers 
under her command are all using her method 
what i do is listen to the language she said in a telephone 
interview from the birmingham office where she counsels estranged 
couples 
if im going to suggest the wording i want to be sure its 
appropriate to the couple she said 
often she and the couple link hands for the ritual nine 
times out of 10 we all end up in tears she said 
renata olins director of a counseling organization called 
london marriage guidance said it was a good idea 
when you get divorced you get a piece of paper through the 
post its pretty bleak so i think the idea of a ritual a rite of 
passage sounds quite therapeutic the paradox is that the 
qualities you need to make the ending good are the same as those 
you need to make a relationship good she said in an interview 
sandra boler editor of the marriage magazine brides was less 
sure of mrs daviss approach shes living in a charming 
paradise she told the independent newspaper 
in her experience she said most separating people are far 
too angry with each other for a ceremony like that often women 
have been ditched with young children and they certainly are not 
going to wish their partner good luck in a new life it really is 
rather unrealistic 
mrs davis said some people think im in cuckoo land of 
course you cant do it with every single couple not every single 
couple should go through it i decide on the basis of working with 
the couples 
she says the idea is catching on around the country and last 
year she lectured on it to marriage guidance counselors visiting 
from north america 
occasionally mrs davis says her ritual even can help rescue a 
marriage people can feel pretty silly saying the words 
sometimes it prompts them to think again

the army has more than 1000 leaking chemical 
weapons and the problem is likely to worsen in future years 
service officials said tuesday 
the leaking weapons are discovered by a complex series of 
sensors at the eight us sites where they are stored witnesses 
told the senate armed services strategic weapons subcommittee 
thats frightening 1000 leakers said sen john glenn 
dohio thats a serious problem the problem is not going to 
get less as the weapons get even older 
army brig gen david nydam estimated the number of leaking 
weapons at more than 1000 but added that the figure was only 
a small percentage of the total us arsenal he agreed with 
glenns assessment that the situation will worsen as the stockpile 
ages 
nydam said the exact size of the us chemical arsenal is 
classified published estimates have range from 25000 to 40000 
tons however 
when leaking weapons are discovered they are enclosed in larger 
containers and then stored separately from the other weapons nydam 
said 
the weapons are stored in closed bunkers and are periodically 
checked to see if any are leaking nydam said 
until recent months the united states hadnt built any chemical 
weapons since 1969 and the armys stockpile is now on average more 
than 25 years old unitary weapons include shells and bombs that 
are filled with a variety of nerve gases and chemicals 
as part of the armys program of building new weapons congress 
ordered the service to come up with a safe method for destruction 
of the existing stockpile 
the army has told congress that it prefers to build closed 
incinerators at the eight us sites because it is too dangerous to 
move the weapons 
the weapons are stored at the aberdeen proving ground md 
anniston army depot ala lexingtonblue grass army depot ky 
newport army ammunition plant ind pine bluff arsenal ark 
pueblo army depot colo tooele army depot utah and umatilla 
army depot ore 
the largest stockpile 42 percent of the total is stored at 
tooele the list does not include us weapons stationed in west 
germany or stored on johnston atoll a deserted island 400 miles 
south of hawaii 
john shannon assistant secretary of the army told the 
subcommittee that the service is pushing ahead with plans to build 
the incineration plants despite some strong local opposition 
shannon said the criticism has come from communities around the 
aberdeen newport and lexington plants the other five have 
expressed the desire that we get on with it he said 
sen dan quayle rind criticized the army for its approach to 
swaying public opinion at the newport site theres been some 
progress but weve got a long way to go he said 
we in the senate become involved when our constituency feels 
it is shortchanged and that is the situation in newport quayle 
said 
shannon agreed saying we did not do a good job in newport in 
the beginning well have to do better 
shannon estimated the total cost of destruction at 27 billion 
and said the job will be completed by 1997 if the plants go ahead 
now

makers of plastic foam food containers will 
stop using ozonedestroying chemicals in their products after this 
year the first industry to give up the compounds completely their 
trade association said tuesday 
major environmental groups and the environmental protection 
agency hailed the decision by members of the foodservice amp packing 
institute as an important symbolic step in persuading others to 
find substitutes for the chlorofluorocarbon or cfc compounds 
consumers will notice little impact because the the decision 
does not mean an end to foam containers valued for their lightness 
and insulating properties things like egg cartons and the 
clamshell hamburger containers used by fastfood chains twothirds 
of those foams currently are made without cfcs 
there are about 15 companies making the food packages said 
joseph w bow president of the institute and more than a third of 
them have signed a letter pledging to give up cfcs by the end of 
the year in 30 days we should have the rest of the industry 
signed up bow said 
about 15 percent to 2 percent of cfc use in the united states 
or 15 million pounds a year goes to foam blowing agents for food 
packages though 30 percent is used in blowing agents for other 
foams such as seat cushions and insulating panels gaseous cfcs are 
released into the atmosphere during the foam manufacturing process 
and some of the compounds also remain trapped in the foam where 
they may be released into the environment later 
for environmentalists though the food packages were a visible 
symbol of the threat to the earths protective ozone layer and 
they already had persuaded some fast food chains and the senate 
restaurant in washington not to use cfcderived containers 
ozone at high altitudes protects the earth from cancercausing 
ultraviolet rays of the sun but can be destroyed by chlorine 
liberated from the breakup of cfc compounds at those altitudes 
last month the national aeronautics and space administration 
reported that cfcs appear to have been responsible for an average 
23 percent decline in the ozone shield at northern hemisphere 
midlatitudes from 1969 to 1986 
a treaty signed by 31 nations last fall requires a 50 percent 
cut in cfc production by 1998 
most of the replacement for cfcs in foam packages is expected to 
be a related compound hcfc22 which has only 5 percent of the 
ozonedestroying ability of the chemicals being given up 
the natural resources defense council the environmental defense 
fund and friends of the earth agreed to work with the packing 
institute in finding an eventual replacement for hcfc22 
all three groups praised the industry and epa administrator lee 
m thomas issued a statement praising the welcome contribution 
of less cfc use as a model of cooperation between industry and 
the environmental community 
the environmental defense fund said the announcement was even 
more significant than the du pont cos announcement last month 
that it wanted to end cfc production because du pont did not commit 
itself to a deadline the way the institute did 
it is our intention to go to other sectors of the economy 
and say these guys did it so can you said david doniger 
attorney for the natural resources defense council 
current noncfc blowing agents mostly volatile hydrocarbons 
like pentane pose environmental threats of their own since these 
compounds help form ozone at low altitudes where it is a pollutant 
the substitute material costs 25 percent to 50 percent more than 
the compounds it replaces but lasts longer so costs will be 
increased little if at all bow said

the democratic presidential candidates stroll 
through harlem was unannounced but word swept the streets its 
jesse jackson 
children scampered up to touch him women in curlers called out 
from upperstory windows youths in jeans and basketball shoes 
hollered from the street and old men hobbled over to see him walk 
by 
it was an impromptu walk down adam clayton powell boulevard from 
the renowned abyssinian baptist church where he had preached on 
sunday morning to sylvias restaurant 15 minutes away 
go jesse the crowds shouted 
youve got my vote 
jesse i pray for you said one old lady 
it was an incongruous sight jackson tall and crisply attired 
in dark blue suit beamed as he walked hand in hand with his wife 
jacqueline their son jonathan astride the candidate all but 
disappeared except for his head as he was swallowed by a gaggle of 
reporters and cameras a phalanx of police officers and a team of 
secret service agents 
they walked a street lined with trash gutted buildings 
dilapidated stores and apartments beatup cars and broken 
sidewalks 
but the street came alive with harlem residents in their 
excitement over jackson they bumped into security agents running 
alongside and behind his entourage as if he were the pied piper 
there seemed to be a sense that jackson was on home turf here 
speaking at the abyssinian church earlier jackson called the 
churchs pastor sam proctor his mentor he recalled that proctor 
and he had many discussions about the missions of the late adam 
clayton powell the local congressman who gained fame as the 
eloquent pastor of the same church and about civil rights leader 
martin luther king 
jackson told the congregation there is still unfinished 
business in the agenda set by king that poor people are still 
hungry and peace is still elusive 
on his walk later jackson hugged passersby and lifted children 
how you doin brother he called out 
he approached a basketball court and some 15 young men raced to 
the chainlink fence around it he couldnt shake their hands 
through the fence but they pressed their palms against one side 
and he put his against the other they tossed him their ball and 
he threw it back over the fence as they cheered wildly 
im not going to wash my hand no more in my life one 
middleaged woman gushed after touching jackson 
a sidewalk bookseller told him i sold out of your book 
two young women called to his wife that she was so lucky to 
have such an attractive husband one of them shouted to jackson 
youre gonna win you handsome devil 
jackson laughed as a boy of about 10 took his hand and chattered 
about his family and point out where his relatives lived 
someone pointed out two tall palm trees in a deserted lot that 
were stripped of their fronds painted crazily and had basketball 
hoops suspended about 30 feet in the air 
aint no goal too high right jesse said a man following 
the candidate

chinese leaders on tuesday elected a new cabinet 
in a vote that indicates a general support for deng xiaopings 
economic reforms although several conservatives received key posts 
qian qichen 60 a career diplomat who has been chinas chief 
negotiator with the soviet union was elected as minister of 
foreign affairs succeeding wu xueqian 67 
gen qin jiwei 74 a member of the communist party politburo 
and commander of the beijing military region took over the defense 
ministry from ailing zhang aiping 78 
continuing an unprecedented movement started at the beginning of 
congress delegates at the national peoples congress actually 
voted against some of the cabinet candidates 
in congresses past all candidates were elected unanimously 
the congress which is chinas legislature also passed two 
amendments to the constitution one guarantees the rights of 
private businessmen while the other recognizes the transfer of 
landuse rights opening the way for the leasing of property 
in voting by 2859 delegates the congress approved three vice 
premiers nine state councillors and 41 ministers for the state 
council or cabinet the stress was on continuity with the large 
majority of ministers either keeping their jobs or turning them 
over to people within their organizations 
the state council is headed by li peng 59 who was formally 
endorsed as premier earlier in the congress annual session 
named as vice premiers were yao yilin and tian jiyun both 
returnees and the outgoing foreign minister wu 
the delegates were not given a choice in who they could pick for 
each office although they could oppose the candidate or abstain 
from voting 
the one surprise was the election of li guixian a 
soviettrained engineer and party boss in anhui province to be 
governor of the peoples bank of china the central bank 
li with no known financial background will be responsible for 
the major task of reforming chinas inflexible banking system to 
allow interest rates to replace central planning in the management 
of the bank 
according to new evening post a hong kong daily he received 404 
opposing votes and 29 abstentions more than any other candidate 
as head of the defense ministry qin one of dengs confidantes 
is expected to carry out dengs plan to mold the defense ministry 
into a more powerful body 
the ministry is now the weak sister to party and state military 
commissions both headed by deng 
qian the new foreign minister is expected to follow closely 
the policies laid down by wu foreign minister since 1982 
china in that period has steadily expanded economic and 
political ties with the west while gradually easing tensions with 
the soviet union 
the official news agency xinhua described the new government as

the government may move troops from a 
formerly embattled western province to mozambique where they would 
fight rightwing rebels the defense minister said tuesday 
the soldiers were sent to matabeleland province six years ago to 
hunt down armed dissidents 
however rebel activity has vanished there since president 
robert mugabe and former opposition leader joshua nkomo signed a 
unity accord dec 22 defense minister enos nkala told the zimbabwe 
interafrican news agency 
the dissidents battled for nkomo in the sevenyear war that 
transformed whiteruled rhodesia into blackgoverned zimbabwe on 
april 18 1980 however they left the army two years later to 
fight the new government killing hundreds of black peasants and 
more than 60 whites 
the parties of nkomo and mugabe last week approved a merger 
expected to lead to oneparty rule by mugabes zimbabwe african 
national union 
the defense chief said the government could plan for withdrawing 
soldiers from matabeleland and deploying them instead to assist the 
government of neighboring mozambique 
about 12000 of mugabes troops are in mozambique guarding trade 
routes and an oil pipeline vital to landlocked zimbabwes economy 
the military chief did not say how many troops might be moved 
the area is threatened by rebels fighting the government of 
marxist president joaquim chissano

exgov evan mechams brief administration 
has sparked the historical interest of both the smithsonian 
institution and the arizona historical society 
mecham a firstterm republican in office just over a year was 
removed from office april 4 when the state senate convicted him of 
two impeachment charges he also was the subject of recall drive 
and faces a may 19 trial on criminal charges accusing him of 
concealing a 350000 campaign loan 
the state societys central division is building an extensive 
collection of material relating to recall him andy masich 
division director said monday 
the smithsonians interest began about a month ago larry bird 
curator of the division of political history of the institutions 
national museum of american history asked a tucson museum official 
to send him a bumper sticker and a couple of campaign buttons 
commemorating the campaign against mecham 
normally our contemporary collection is limited to national 
politics bird said in a telephone interview but this is a 
relatively unusual event 
diane dittemore curator of the arizona state museum in tucson 
said she sent bird a bumper sticker reading king had a dream 
arizona has a nightmare and two buttons a redandwhite one 
saying mecham watchdog committee and a yellowandblack one 
reading recall ev 
edith richardson mechams campaign manager said of the 
smithsonians acquisitioni think its rather sad for an 
institution we all regard so highly to display such material 
bird who studied at the university of arizona said he wasnt 
sure that the recall material would become a part of the museums 
permanent collection 
we asked for the memorabilia as a matter of routine he 
said its not as if were making a federal case out of it any 
scholar who wants to study the phenomenon of the arizona recall is 
more likely to contact a museum there for material than the 
smithsonian 
masich said the society contacted the recall headquarters before 
it closed and got an extensive donation of campaign materials 
im sure well be collecting a lot more he added

white house spokesman marlin fitzwater today 
sharply criticized his predecessor larry speakes for falsely 
attributing remarks to president reagan and vowed that he would 
never follow such a practice himself 
its a damned outrage thats what it is fitzwater told 
reporters at his regular daily briefing 
when reporters bombarded fitzwater with questions about speakes 
statements made in his book speaking out the spokesman said 
the questions illustrated why i resent it so much 
to make up quotes casts aspersions on the presidency and on my 
position and the questions you just asked are the best reasons why 
its wrong why he shouldnt have done it and why i wont do it 
he said 
everyone is appalled that he made up quotes fitzwater added 
fitzwater said he takes notes during presidential meetings and 
if he didnt say it i wont say he said it i never have 
fitzwater said he had not talked to the president about the 
matter but i am sure he would be upset about it i am sure he 
is 
the spokesman also said he had not talked with mark weinberg an 
assistant press secretary who speakes said helped him make up 
quotations to attribute to reagan during his 1985 summit meeting 
with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev in geneva 
i dont know what his role was there he said of weinberg 
clearly he was doing what larry wanted and he would not do 
anything that i do not want him to do 
fitzwater was a deputy under speakes but had left the white 
house and was vice president george bushs press secretary at the 
time of the incidents described by the former spokesman 
speakes interviewed by telephone from new york had no reaction 
to fitzwaters statement id be better off not to comment he 
said 
but he offered no apoligies saying its an honest book 
state department spokesman charles e redman asked about the 
practice of making up quotes said i dont do it 
paul weyrich president of the free congress foundation talking 
to reporters after an hourlong meeting of conservatives with the 
president said i think that the president is illserved by all 
of these people who are in public service and then write books the 
minute they get out and reveal things that ought not to be 
revealed 
i dont condone the kind of selfserving i really was the 
president type attitude of mike deaver and speakes and all the 
rest weyrich said all theyre in it for is making a buck 
and frankly they ought to be ashamed of themselves 
speakes says in his book that after a korean air lines plane 
carrying 61 americans was shot down in 1983 he credited statements 
made by secretary of state george shultz to reagan 
and he says that during reagans summit meeting with gorbachev 
in geneva he attributed to reagan remarks that he and weinberg had 
manufactured 
speakes said today the two instances he mentions of manufactured 
quotes were the only two that i specifically recall that we did 
it was a case of knowing the president well and knowing how he felt 
about the events taking place and knowing what he would say 
the former spokesman also said he had informed reagan of the 
madeup quotes 
i generally told him you know what i had done you know and 
the reasons for doing it he never objected to you know these 
cases where i said you know ive gone ahead and done this 
speakes said 
speakes often boasted that he never lied to the press during his 
six years as reagans chief spokesman his book is scheduled for 
publication next month by charles scribners sons 
reagan met with the national security council and with 
congressional leaders after a soviet plane shot down the kal 
aircraft on aug 31 1983 
speakes says shultz declared during the congressional leaders 
meeting that the incident was not a problem between the united 
states and the soviet union but a soviet versus the world 
problem 
since the president had had almost nothing to say during the 
national security and congressional leadership meetings i made 
presidential quotes out of shultz comment about the incident 
pitting the whole world against the soviet union as well as some 
of shultz suggestions about what retaliatory steps we should 
take speakes writes 
my decision to put shultz words in reagans mouth played well 
and neither of them complained 
in his account ofthe geneva summit speakes says he felt that 
gorbachev was really getting the advantage over us in his 
giveandtake with reporters while reagan was very tentative and 
stilted in his comments 
fearing that reagan was losing the media version of star wars 
i instructed mark weinberg to draft some quotes for the 
president speakes says i polished the quotes and told the 
press that while the two leaders stood together at the end of one 
session the president said to gorbachev there is much that 
divides us but i believe the world breathes easier because we are 
talking here together 
speakes says that cbs used the quote in its evening television 
news and chris wallace of nbc reported the talks were frank the 
presidents best statement came off camera aides quoting him as 
saying the world breathes easier because we are talking 
together 
another reagan quote which we manufactured that received 
extensive play in the press was our differences are serious but 
so is our commitment to improving understanding speakes writes 
in retrospect it was clearly wrong to take such liberties 
the former spokesman says in his account of the geneva meeting 
certainly reagan would not have disavowed the words but the 
soviets could have said they never heard anything like that 
luckily the russians didnt dispute the quotes and i had been able 
to spruce up the presidents image by taking a bit of liberty with 
my pr mans license 
in an interview published today in the washington post speakes 
said that making up presidential quotes is not lying 
when youre a press secretary you develop a bond of 
understanding with the president so that you think like the 
president he said i knew those quotes were the way he felt

a sharply divided senate foreign relations 
committee refused to slap mexico on tuesday over its failings in 
the war on drugs leaving that decision to the full senate where 
it could come to a vote in the next few days 
the panel did approve a similar resolution condemning the 
bahamas for not doing enough to combat drug trafficking and moved 
to add haiti to the list of countries that should come under 
increased scrutiny as drug producing or transit points the vote on 
the bahamas issue was 106 and the haiti resolution passed on a 
voice vote 
the reagan admnistration last month certified that mexico and 
the bahamas are fully cooperating with us efforts to halt 
drug trafficking such a certification is required for any foreign 
country identified as a drug producing or transit point to continue 
to receive us aid and other benefits 
but sen pete wilson rcalif objected to the mexico 
certification pointing to continued high rates of marijuana and 
cocaine flowing into the united states from that country and 
problems with official corruption and lack of cooperation with us 
drug interdiction authorities 
wilson proposed a resolution to decertify mexico which could 
subject it to aid lending and trade sanctions under us law 
the foreign relations panel after lengthy debate over the 
effect of such a move on overall us relations with mexico 
defeated an effort to send the bill to the floor with a favorable 
recommendation the vote was an 88 tie which defeated the motion 
under committee rules 
in effect the action left the decision to the full senate 
since the bill has priority status and must go to the floor for 
final action in any case 
but sen john kerry dmass who has been holding hearings on 
latin american drug trafficking said the move represented a 
victory in the war on drugs it reflects the changing mood and 
dynamic in congress kerry said noting that several senators had 
switched sides on the issue in light of a growing awareness of the 
drug problem 
kerry predicted a hardfought debate when the measure comes to 
the floor later this week or next week and said he could not 
predict the outcome 
the measure is primarily symbolic in its impact on foreign aid 
since mexicos only current us aid is 145 million in money to 
combat drugs money which would be unaffected by any sanctions 
more important for mexico however could be a requirement that 
the united states oppose future loans from international 
development banks the united states has a weighted vote in 
decisions on such loans but not a majority 
decertification also could expose mexico to various trade 
sanctions at the discretion of the president 
arguing for the mexico resolution kerry noted that the 
administration itself had noted numerous failings by mexico when it 
certified full cooperation on march 1 noting that a higher 
level of cooperation was needed you cant have it both ways 
kerry said 
the point has really arrived where other countries are 
watching us he said noting that panamanian ruler gen manuel 
antonio noriega indicted in the united states on drug trafficking 
charges seems to be drawing strength from us confusion over its 
policy toward him 
but sen christopher dodd dconn said mexico already is 
devoting large proportions of its national budget to fighting drug 
trafficking and that decertification would destroy that cooperation 
theyre doing a great deal dodd said this is a slap in 
the face thats going to set us in the wrong direction if this 
resolution is adopted you can expect the worst kind of 
cooperation

the united states today recommended a massive 
unsponsored effort to help afghanistans estimated eight million 
refugees return in safety and honor as soviet troops withdraw 
state department spokesman charles e redman said the united 
states was prepared to help plan the return of the afghans most of 
whom fled to pakistan to escape soviet attacks but he said the 
united nations and its specialized agencies are the logical 
organizations to coordinate the job 
redman said that a constructive effort is taking place to work 
out an interim government and to help the refugees return in safety 
and honor 
he said there was no timetable for the return of the refugees 
and added 
this process has to be done in such a way that its done 
securly that these people are taken care of there is obviously 
going to be some social disorganization inside afghanistan as this 
proceeds we need to try to do this in a coordinated way 
the return of the afghan refugees and the withdrawal of soviet 
troops are envisioned in a fourpart accord that afghanistan 
pakistan and the afghan rebels are scheduled to sign on thursday 
although white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters 
at a briefing that reagans conservative supporters were very 
supportive and very happy with the afghan agreement a group of 
conservative leaders met with the president for an hour today and 
expressed concerns about the pact 
we think the administration is wellintentioned but we 
question the results paul weyrich president of the free 
congress foundation said afterwards 
secretary of state george p shultz acknowledged it will be 
difficult to end the fighting even after the soviets leave the 
country but he predicted the withdrawal will bring some stability 
to the wartorn nation 
i expect that the soviet union will withdraw fully from 
afghanistan and then the people of afghanistan have got to work 
things out shultz said thats their right and their problem 
the secretary met with reporters after president reagan 
announced on monday that he was dispatching shultz to geneva to 
sign the troopwithdrawal accords negotiated last week between 
afghanistan and pakistan 
reagan lauded the usbacked rebels who have battled the kabul 
regime since the 1979 soviet invasion 
this development would not have been possible had it not been 
for the valiant struggle of the afghan people to rid their country 
of foreign occupation reagan said we take great pride in 
having assisted the afghan people in this triumph and they can 
count on our continued support 
asked about charges from conservatives that the agreement is a 
sellout of the rebels reagan replied we are not 
under the agreement the united states and soviet union will 
guarantee a plan dictating the removal of the red armys 115000 
troops from afghanistan 
the plan has been worked out under the auspices of the united 
nations and is expected to be signed on thursday 
the pullout is set to begin may 15 only two weeks before reagan 
is scheduled to fly to moscow for his fourth summit session with 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
the rebels or mujahedeen were not part of the talks they have 
rejected the agreement and pledged to continue fighting to topple 
the kabul government 
yet under a compromise with moscow that is not a formal part of 
the accords the united states will continue sending weapons to the 
rebels while the kremlin continues providing arms to the marxist 
government 
asked if us pledges to continue supporting the rebels 
contradict the formal agreement shultz replied only im not 
going to step into that hole 
he said the united states would continue to aid the rebels as 
needed 
we have stood by the afghan people during this 8 years and 
were prepared to stand by them in the coming months to help 
afghans return home and begin rebuilding their lives and their 
country he added 
reagan called the agreement historic while shultz hailed it 
as a major international success 
this is the first time in the history of the soviet union that 
they have moved by aggression into another country and then had to 
withdraw shultz said 
the secretary acknowledged that the removal of soviet troops 
will not necessarily mean an end to the fighting between the kabul 
regime and the rebels he said he expected the un mediator diego 
cordovez to do everything he can to develop an interim 
government 
we know its not easy shultz said it will be hard 
but on capitol hill sen gordon humphrey rnh denounced the 
agreement as amounting to a slowmotion sellout of the 
resistance fighters 
its a poor deal a very bad deal he said the soviets 
are perfectly free under this agreement to resupply the communist 
puppet regime in kabul just as lavishly as they please 
the accord calls for the return to afghanistan of millions of 
afghan refugees most of whom moved to neighboring pakistan 
undoubtedly there will be a massive movement of refugees from 
outside afghanistan into afghanistan by the millions shultz 
said so there will be immense social dislocation and potential 
for suffering and we and others in the international community 
will want to do everything we can to ease that transition 
the united states has urged the appointment of a special un 
coordinator to oversee repatriation 
in our view the soviet union having inflicted so much 
suffering on the afghan people has a special obligation to provide 
resources for this resettlement shultz said 
under the accord some 50 percent of the soviet forces are to be 
removed over a threemonth period beginning in may all remaining 
soviet forces are to be out by feb 15 1989 
shultz said soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze has 
promised to complete the withdrawal by the end of the year ahead 
of the deadline he said the united states will push for that and 
expect that

the archdiocese of atlanta said tuesday it will 
not take disciplinary action against a priest at a suburban roman 
catholic parish who said pope john paul ii is dead wrong on the 
issue of celibacy 
the rev anthony curran was very gracious in acknowledging the 
inaccuracy of some of his statements during a meeting with 
monsignor john f mcdonough at the archdiocese offices said the 
rev peter dora 
dora communications director for the archdiocese said curran 
could have been suspended from his priestly functions as punishment 
curran a priest for 21 years told his parishioners at stone 
mountains corpus christi catholic church last weekend that the 
doctrine of priestly celibacy leads to alcoholism and other 
aberrant behavior 
dora said the archdiocese had received numerous complaints 
from parishioners about currans comments 
curran 46 is associate pastor at corpus christi which was 
rocked last week by the indictment of a former priest for child 
molestation and other offenses involving four altar boys 
dora said curran will draft a letter to his parishioners 
clarifying his statements and after mcdonough approves the letter 
it will be read at masses over the weekend 
the diocese had problems with a priest using the pulpit to 
address his own opinions and concerns that was the central issue 
as far as the diocese was concerned dora said the question of 
celibacy will continue to be discussed openly and seriously within 
the catholic church within the appropriate settings 
curran said monday in a telephone interview that his parishs 
crisis is of a much larger context than charges against one 
priest 
i think the real issue is when will the church deal with the 
truth of all the pain of celibacy as the clergy experience it

i hate them when you have two people inside to take over

frankfurt officials said today 
that mohammed ali hamadi charged with air piracy and murder in the 
1985 twa hijacking to beirut will be tried before a juvenile court 
the decision by the frankfurt state court means the 23yearold 
hamadi faces a maximum of 10 years imprisonment if convicted if 
tried as an adult hamadi could have received life imprisonment if 
found guilty 
hamadis trial had been expected to begin at the end of may 
officials said last week todays decision made no mention of a 
date although it indicated the start of the trial might be delayed 
the hesse state youth court will now need time to study the 
case files before it can decide on when mohammed hamadis trial 
will start the court statement said 
the statement telexed to news media said the state 
prosecutors office in frankfurt had listed hamadis birth date as 
june 13 1964 
however a possibility exists that the perpetration of the 
crime that he is accused of may have begun before june 13 1985 
and goes back to the time of his adolescence 
therefore the case has been turned over to the youth court 
the statement said 
a federal justice ministry spokesman said the juvenile court 
could decide to exclude the press from hamadis trial 
the press can be excluded from the trial if the court finds it 
is in the best interest of the accused said the spokesman who 
spoke on condition of anonymity he said the decision on whether to 
bar the press would not be made until the trial begins 
the charges against hamadi stem from a hijacking that began june 
15 1985 on that day shiite moslem gunmen seized a twa jetliner 
on an athenstorome flight and forced it to beirut lebanon one 
american a us navy diver was killed during the hijacking and 39

school teacher terry weeks has donned the garb 
of a terrorist to get his seventhgrade students in murfreesboro 
tenn to grapple with viewpoints diametrically opposed to their 
own 
he also has posed as andrew jackson and anwar sadat to bring 
history alive in his classroom 
on tuesday weeks assumed a new role that he will play for the 
next 12 months the 1988 national teacher of the year 
the 37yearold social studies instructor from central middle 
school in murfreesboro appeared on national television and held a 
news conference to kick off a celebratory week that includes a stop 
at the white house on thursday to receive a crystal apple from 
president reagan 
for weeks who makes 25000 after 15 years in the classroom it 
was a taste of adulation he said he wished all teachers could share 
i wish somehow i could bundle it all up and as i go across the 
country this next year just kind of spread it out to the 
teachers he said they need to know that there are news 
cameras waiting on the teacher of the year when he gets off of a 
plane people wanting to know how he teaches and what is it 
that keeps him in the classroom 
he also told reporters i cant do the moon walk i cant slam 
dunk a basketball im a teacher 
but weeks a director of the tennessee education association and 
former president of his union local also complained of low 
salaries and poor working conditions for public school teachers 
teachers by far represent the best bargain going for this 
country said weeks teachers need to have more control over 
what happens in the schools including the curriculum schedule 
and choice of textbooks 
we are secretaries we are filing clerks we are 
psychologists we have to be legal scholars we cant go to the 
bathroom every time we need to go because there are 30 children in 
the classroom he said 
weeks whose wife mary is a nurse said he has stayed in the 
classroom despite low pay because every day i know ive had the 
opportunity to make a difference in the lives of 150 students 
to me theres no more noble calling than teaching but again 
thats not to say im satisfied with the low salary 
weeks a carpenters son is a graduate of middle tennessee 
state university he has been the seventh grade social studies 
teacher at central middle school for 14 years 
he said his posing as a terrorist and other historical figures 
is all aimed at forcing his students to think and not just memorize 
things 
nothings simple any more theres no yesno answers any 
longer instead of just basic skills i want to get to the depth to 
help them compare contrast he said when im gone the 
problems we have today wont be the problems they will face but 
the skills will enable them to deal with the problems thats my 
main goal as a teacher 
the teacher of the year competition is sponsored by the council 
of chief state school officers the encylclopaedia britannica cos

who was put on the radio tuesday by the hijackers to beg for the 
release 17 proiranian bombers imprisoned in kuwait the 
terrorists main demand 
this is what were all waiting for he said plaintively 
we all want to go home 
the boeing landed at larnaca friday after a harrowing flight 
from mashhad in northeast iran the veteran iraqi pilot capt 
youssef subhi 53 frantically radioed he was running out of fuel 
after he was refused permission to touch down at beirut and 
damascus 
since then the shiite hijackers armed with guns and grenades 
have repeatedly demanded that the jumbo jet be refueled 
two captives their hands tied behind their backs have been 
shot in the head and their bodies pushed out of the jet onto the 
tarmac of the beachside runway 
the hostages inside the jet must be terrified wondering who 
will be next said a cypriot air traffic controller one of a 
team assigned to maintain contact with the hijackers he asked that 
his name not be used 
every time the hijackers set a new deadline each passenger 
must fear that maybe hell be the one the hijackers pick on when 
its not met 
passenger fadel khaled alsabah a businessman and cousin of 
kuwaits emir shieik jaber alahmed alsabah could barely talk 
when the hijackers put him on the radio to plead for fuel 
we depend on god for our fate he said in a strained voice 
after reciting a verse from the koran islams holy book 
when he suddenly broke off the tower asked what was wrong one 
of the hijackers snapped back in broken english he is sick he 
cannot hold his food he is vomiting 
the hijackers have reported that several other captives were 
ailing but given no details two nights ago one gunman requested 
maalox suspension an antacid medicine painstakingly spelling out 
the name so the tower got it right he did not say who it was for 
one of the four negotiators who was allowed to step inside the 
plane once said he briefly spoke to alsabahs sister ebtesam 
who with another sister anware are the only women aboard 
ebtesam had blood smeared under her nose asked how it got 
there the woman said i had a nosebleed its because im 
nervous and the air is so dry in here 
the 42yearold flight engineer ayed eid ali shamlan who was 
hijacked once before in 1984 reported the sky pirates have beaten 
some of the passengers 
doctors at larnaca morgue reported that both men who were killed 
had been badly beaten before they were shot by the hijackers who 
have threatened to continue a slow and quiet massacre of their 
captives 
the conditions inside the plane must be harrowing by now 
said the controller a veteran of several hijacks on this east 
mediterranean island that because of its location only 100 miles 
from lebanon has become a crossroads for terrorists in the middle 
east 
during the day it must be like a turkish bath 
the hijackers repeatedly demanded mobile generators to power the 
air conditioning system and reported tuesday that the temperature 
inside the main cabin soared to 104 degrees fahrenheit when a 
generator ran out of fuel 
hurry up hurry up one hijacker snapped to the tower as he 
waited for a new generator to be rolled up 
is is hot in there the tower asked 
yes it is the hijacker snarled its only 30 degrees 86 
fahrenheit outside 
the controller noted thats the first time ive heard him 
display any emotion usually theyre calm very matteroffact 
even when theyve just killed a hostage 
they rarely raise their voices they seem welleducated and at 
least one is wellversed technically theyre the coolest customers 
ive encountered 
the window shades are drawn 24 hours a day the hijackers open 
the doors to haul up plastic bags of food and refreshments when the 
delivery teams move away 
the passengers and flight crew along with their captors have 
eaten little since friday they got a hot meal of meat and 
vegetables friday night but since then have had daily deliveries 
of bread cakes cheese soft drinks and mineral water 
much of the radio chatter is about technical matters or 
housekeeping such as requests to empty the toilets that seem 
trivial as the deadly drama unfolds 
but the threat of violence is never far away despite the air of 
normality outside as other jets arrive filled with tourists for the 
beaches across the bay 
when a camouflaged c130 military transport landed tuesday one 
of the hijackers who was fearful it contained troops to storm the 
jet yelled into the radio we see a military plane identify it 
the controller explained it was a greek air force plane on a 
routine weekly flight supplying greek officers with the cyprus 
national guard and nothing to worry about 
the hijacker said my men were about to shoot at it

spring thaws have opened the mountain 
supply routes of moslem guerrillas and the seasonal surge of 
fighting in afghanistan has begun despite a unsponsored accord 
on soviet military withdrawal 
leaders of the insurgency which began after a communist coup in 
april 1978 were not parties to the geneva agreement announced last 
week and have said repeatedly they would continue the war 
western diplomats said tuesday there was a sharp increase of 
military activity in the past two weeks in eastern afghanistan near 
pakistan about 35 million afghan refugees live in camps and 
cities just inside pakistan that serve as bases and supply points 
for the guerrillas 
insurgents overran seven afghan army posts in logar province in 
the first week of april and on monday a 450unit soviet convoy 
including more than 100 armored vehicles headed south toward the 
province from kabul the diplomats reported they said the level of 
fighting appeared normal for early spring 
radio kabul reported that afghan guerrillas downed a 
sovietbuilt passenger plane near the soviet border on sunday 
killing all 29 people aboard 
increased fighting also was reported in kandahar and khost 
the withdrawal agreement is expected to be signed thursday in 
geneva by the the afghan government pakistan and the united states 
and soviet union as guarantors the guerrillas were not invited to 
the negotiations and pakistan acted as their representative 
in moscow an italian source said yuli vorontsov first deputy 
foreign minister told italian parliamentarians that 50000 soviet 
soldiers will be withdrawn in the first three months after may 15 
soviet soldiers entered afghanistan in december 1979 and 
vorontsovs reported statement was the first indication kremlin 
officials have given of how many were there 
under the accord to be signed in geneva the soviets agree to 
remove all the troops within nine months of may 15 half of them by 
aug 15 
based on the figure given by vorontsov the total soviet force 
in afghanistan would be about 100000 western sources have 
estimated it at 115000 
guerrilla leaders have said they would ignore any agreement 
reached without their direct participation and contend that the 
only real parties to the afghan conflict are themselves and the 
soviets 
they consider the government in kabul now led by najib to be 
a kremlin puppet 
diplomatic and other sources reported more fighting in kandahar 
afghanistans secondlargest city and said wounded government and 
soviet soldiers arrived in kabul last week all the sources spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
insurgents knocked out a government radio station in the city 
march 25 and later did the same to the television station 
diplomats said they said the radio station had not resumed 
broadcasting by the first week of april 
the sources also reported fighting at khost the eastern 
garrison town where sovietafghan forces lifted a guerrilla seige 
last january after weeks of combat 
diplomats reported a rise in convoy activity and air transport 
traffic at kabul airport which they say reflects a redeployment of 
soviet soldiers and efforts to build up supplies for the afghan 
military before the withdrawal 
they reported seeing twinengine soviet an72 aircraft or 
possibly an74s in afghanistan for the first time last week the 
shorttakeoffandlanding planes which have a fast rate of climb 
are less vulnerable than others to us supplied stinger 
antiaircraft missiles now used by the insurgents 
according to the diplomats the aircraft may be there to help 
deliver supplies within afghanistan rather than evacuate soviet 
personnel and equipment

mario cuomos promise not to accept a 
convention draft will prove most beneficial to michael dukakis 
campaign say prominent democrats who believe the new york 
governors vow will finally put an end to speculation over a cuomo 
candidacy 
the last holdouts the new york city press corps may now 
understand what the rest of the country understands the nominee 
is in the race robert beckel a political consultant and onetime 
adviser to former vice president walter mondale said monday 
cuomo said this weekend that democrats should interpret his 
earlier statements criticizing any draft efforts to mean he 
wouldnt accept a draft for the nomination 
dukakis who is battling jesse jackson for frontrunner status 
and a major share of the 255 delegates at stake in the april 19th 
new york primary is expected to reap the benefits from cuomos 
statement 
nathan landow a maryland developer and major democratic party 
fundraiser said cuomos decision certainly takes some doubt out 
of the peoples mind who were hoping for an alternative to dukakis 
i think it will unite the party much faster and bring the focus of 
november into a much earlier view 
landow who is advising tennesse sen albert gore jr said 
gore could benefit from this too gore becomes the clear 
alternative to dukakis 
the onetime cuomo supporter said there will be a lot of 
disappointed democrats around the country who had a certain glimmer 
of hope concerning his candidacy 
former democratic national committee chairman john white said he 
believed cuomo from the start when the new york governor said he 
was not a candidate but the statement clears the air 
white an adviser to jackson said whatever plus in cuomos 
announcement has to go to dukakis 
certainly in new york it helps dukakis because there was 
considerable reluctance for party leaders to get committed it 
frees them and a good many will go to dukakis he said i think 
thats marginal i dont think its enough to tip the race one way 
or another 
one possible delegate new york city mayor edward koch 
responded to cuomos vow with the announcement that he would soon 
endorse either dukakis or gore koch had been preparing to lead a 
draftcuomo move at the national convention 
and former new york rep richard ottinger a leader of the 
draftcuomo movement said he was suspending his effort 
a large number of the uncommitted a disproportionate share of 
those people felt that cuomo should run for president said lee 
miringoff director of the marist institute for public opinion a 
larger number of those were people who had indicated in previous 
polling they were supporting dukakis 
the most recent marist poll said 8 percent of likely new york 
democratic primary voters surveyed said they planned to support a 
procuomo uncommitted slate on the ballot next week 
while miringoff said the numbers werent large there should be 
a shift in light of cuomos latest statements that would create 
a slight enhancement of the dukakis advantage for the new york 
primary 
the latest marist poll conducted last week had dukakis the 
choice of 47 percent of the democrats surveyed jesse jackson was 
the choice of 31 percent and gore 6 percent 
cuomo insisted that his ruling out accepting a draft was really 
nothing more than what he has been saying for more than a year but 
he said he felt that he had to take extra steps to clarify it 
im trying with as much effort as ive ever expended on it to shut 
it down so theres absolutely no question so it doesnt get 
discussed 
white said the political necessity that forced cuomo to make a 
clarifying statement reflects the new york governors strength 
the more he says no the more we seem to court him and want 
him white said people are going to go ahead and accept his 
statement but theres going to be a lot of talk hes kind of 
like the girl who keeps turning you down

a state department official testified 
tuesday in the cocaine trial of carlos lehder rivas that he tried 
to alert the bahamas prime minister to illegal activity in the 
islands but was only asked the identity of his sources 
andrew f antippas former deputy director the us mission in 
nassau said he was removed from his post in 1983 after 
investigating complaints about the bahamian island of normans cay 
he is now stationed in south korea 
defense attorneys complained that testimony was going far beyond 
the original cocainesmuggling indictment and said they were 
planning to ask for a mistrial 
the errors that have previously been committed will be grossly 
compounded said defense attorney edward r shohat arguing 
against allowing antippas testimony 
in clear terms this is a hydraheaded case said shohat 
who added that much of the testimony in lehders trial has been 
outside the scope of the indictment which covers the period of 
1978 to 1980 
lehder 38 and codefendant jack carlton reed 57 are on trial 
on charges they conspired to smuggle some 33 tons of cocaine into 
the united states from normans cay in the bahamas 
this indictment has been stressed and mangled so much that is 
unrecognizable said jose quinon another defense attorney 
us attorney robert w merkle the chief prosecutor in the 
case however argued that shohat was incorrect 
mr shohat can shout from now to the cows come home but it 
is not going to make the sun come up in the west said merkle 
us district judge howell w melton allowed antippas to 
testify but limited hearsay testimony 
antippas testified he met with bahamian prime minister lynden o 
pindling in 1981 to discuss written complaints he had received from 
americans living on normans cay 
i raised this with the prime minister and he said he knew of 
no such complaints and problems on the island he asked me who 
these people were and i declined to tell him said antippas 
he said he also complained to clement maynard home affairs 
minister in the bahamas and asked that police be stationed on the 
island to protect americans and their property maynard agreed 
in january 1982 antippas said he went to the island and found 
that police there had no vehicles and were apparently doing nothing 
he returned in april 1983 and found the island nearly deserted 
he also collected telephone toll records and ledgers from the 
island and placed them in the embassy vault in nassau 
in december 1982 a new ambassador was appointed for the 
bahamas lev dobriansky and six months later antippas said the 
governor told him to find another job 
the items he had stored in the vault couldnt be found he said 
gorman bannister in earlier testimony had said his father 
nassau businessman everette bannister a close associate of 
pindling had complained that antippas was a thorn in his side and 
vowed to have him removed 
lehder is charged with conspiracy possession of cocaine with 
intent to distribute importation of cocaine and operating a 
continuing criminal enterprise 
reed of san pedro calif is charged with only being a member 
of the smuggling conspiracy

a new type of laboratory mouse broke legal 
ground tuesday as the federal government granted harvard university 
the first us patent on an animal 
a few minutes ago we issued a patent which for the first time 
in the history of the us patent and trademark office covers an 
animal patent commissioner donald j quigg announced shortly 
after noon 
this particular animal is a mouse which has been genetically 
engineered so as to make it more susceptible to cancer quigg 
said 
the patent no 4736866 named philip leder of chestnut hill 
mass and timothy a stewart of san francisco as inventors of the 
mouse which is to be used for research into cancer 
patents on forms of life are not new with both plants and types 
of bacteria having been patented in the past 
almost any type of animal except humans could be considered 
for a patent quigg said 
the patent office said last year that it was considering patents 
on animals following an appellate court ruling in a case involving 
a new type of oyster 
that ruling said that the agency could go beyond the plants and 
bacteria to which it had previously limited patents on life forms 
the oyster patent was never issued however with examiners 
concluding that the process was not original enough 
the only other animal case occurred in 1974 when the patent 
office refused to patent a dwarf chicken 
the question of patenting animals has raised some controversy in 
recent years however with opponents questioning the ethics of 
changing animals 
bills have been introduced in congress to place a moratorium on 
such patents until the ethical problems can be worked out and 
quigg said that congress and the scientific laboratory are the 
proper forum for such debates 
the patent application for the mouse which had been pending 
since june 22 1984 met the legal requirements for a patent and 
so one was issued he said 
there are 21 more animal patent applications pending for the 
agency quigg added federal law requires that the subject of 
applications be kept secret until a patent is issued he said 
however quigg said further animal patents are not expected to 
issue for some months 
according to the mouse patent a cancersusceptible gene is 
introduced to the mouse embryo when it is first formed at the 
stage of one or two cells 
the genetic material used to change the mice is spliced together 
from an activated version of the mouse cancer gene and a virus that 
causes mammary tumors in mice explained harvard spokeswoman 
lillian blacker 
having mice that are more sensitive to cancer can be a major 
benefit for researchers quigg said 
currently mice are often exposed to massive doses of chemicals 
to see if cancer results the altered mice could be exposed to 
chemical levels more like those encountered by humans perhaps 
making the experiments more easily related to human dangers quigg 
said 
the mice have been used in research since 1984 at harvard 
blacker said with the introduced traits remaining true through 
several generations 
the sensitive mice can be used both to test the causes of cancer 
and cancerfighting agents blacker and quigg both said 
the patent office announcement drew prompt reaction on both 
sides of the issue 
jeremy rifkin of the foundation on economic trends termed the 
action an arrogant abuse of power by the patent office rifkin 
who has opposed genetic engineering said a coalition of groups 
will seek to get congress to overturn the action 
rifkin also raised the possibility that an engineered mouse 
could escape and breed with wild mice perhaps posing a danger to 
the environment 
but the industrial biotechnology association hailed the action 
for providing researchers a new tool for cancer research 
legally a patent holder has the right to exclusive use of an 
invention for 17 years in practice most patent holders license 
their developments to others collecting a fee the idea is to 
encourage invention by protecting the rights of individuals who 
produce something new

and roughhousing and later everybody in the big family except for 
the very youngest had dinner together 
those mealtimes were school away from school but we loved 
them she said my father would toss questions at us about 
history if we knew the answers wed yell them out as though we 
were winning a big jackpot in a quiz show and if we drew blanks 
my father would say quietly you can do better than that that 
made us want to do better 
she remembered his telling the children take the hard course 
not the easy way make the tough decisions 
she said that around 830 pm all the children left their 
bedrooms at kennedys call and sat on the floor at the top of the 
stairs 
before the cross that hung there my father would read bible 
stories one each night from a childrens version of the old 
testament and wed sit in total silence which was unusual for us 
entranced 
i never forgot those evenings now we read the same bible 
stories every night to our children who are just as enchanted by 
them as we were

northeastern states with high levels of public 
spending have the most vital economies while low wage low tax 
states in the south plains and mountain regions have the worst a 
private research organization said tuesday 
the corporation for enterprise development seeking to counter 
business climate studies that give high marks to states with the 
least government spending released an economic report card that 
listed six states as leaders in the economic competition between 
the states all but one border on or include parts of the 
washingtonboston urban corridor 
the northeast is where todays economic action is said 
robert friedman president of the nonprofit research group 
getting grades of a or b in each of four areas economic 
performance business vitality economic capacity and policy 
strength were connecticut maryland massachusetts new jersey 
vermont and minnesota 
friedman said those states have in common a longstanding 
commitment to public investments 
states should not compete with third world countries for 
industries whose prime concern is cost friedman argued in 
todays economy we will compete not just by making more of 
something cheaper but by making it better or differently 
new jersey and vermont are new on the honor roll which was 
released for the first time last year 
california and new york which made it into the top group last 
year slipped friedman said that was largely because the 1988 
report more heavily weights the gap between rich and poor in those 
states 
the next group of states which did well overall in the 1988 
ranking and which friedman called the contenders were 
pennsylvania wisconsin washington california maine delaware 
and virginia 
states getting mostly ds and fs this year were idaho nevada 
south dakota and the southern states of alabama louisiana 
mississippi oklahoma and tennessee 
arkansas georgia north carolina and south carolina which had 
ranked near the bottom in 1987 moved out of the lowest group of 
states 
the report cautioned that the rankings are relative and that a 
states movement may not be due to any change within the state but 
could be caused by improvement or deterioration in other states 
the economic performance grade includes job growth pay levels 
the poverty rate the crime rate environmental quality and infant 
mortality 
business vitality refers to the competitiveness and diversity of 
current business and a states ability to spawn new businesses 
economic capacity covers a states financial resources its 
infrastructure such as roads and bridges and the education level of 
its workforce 
policy strength measures the effectiveness of government 
regulation education spending and support for research 
the 200000 study was paid for by grants 38 percent from 
private foundations 32 percent from businesses and 30 percent from 
labor unions friedman said 
grant thornton a chicago accounting firm which compiles one of 
the most wellknown business climate indexes has noted the union 
funding and has criticized the corporation for enterprise 
development for being too subjective it says its own rankings 
which assign greater weight to cost factors reflect the priorities 
of manufacturing firms

police arrested 35 jews on tuesday after a 
demonstration in central moscow in which the asked authorities to 
explain why they havent been allowed to emigrate a jewish 
activist said 
bella gulko said she and 45 other refuseniks those who have 
been denied permission to emigrate went to the reception office 
of the communist party central committee seeking promised 
explanations on why they have been unable to obtain exit visas no 
one would receive them she said 
the group of refuseniks had alerted the central committee on 
monday of their plan to visit citing a pledge given them by party 
and government officials at a march 1 meeting that they would be 
given a reply within 40 days she said 
when the refuseniks were denied a meeting with officials they 
went across the street from the central committee building and 
stood there some holding placards demanding exit visas said ms 
gulko 48 who has been seeking for nine years to emigrate 
three buses then pulled up to the group and 35 were arrested 
she said 
the police treated us roughly ripping up our signs and 
pulling us and twisting us by the arms ms gulko said none of 
the demonstrators was injured she said 
the jews were taken to two police stations where some were held 
for more than five hours she said a police complaint was filed 
against the refuseniks accusing them of holding an illegal 
demonstration she said 
two of the protesters were fined the equivalent of 16 by a 
moscow neighborhood court the others requested legal 
representation and were told they would go on trial later she 
said 
new regulations that went into effect last year require soviet 
authorities to tell applicants for emigration why their request has 
been rejected 
jewish activists however say the rules are ignored or that 
overly general reasons are given that dont tell applicants for an 
exit visa exactly why their request has been refused 
ms gulko formerly was employed as an engineer specializing in 
ventilation and air conditioning systems she said she has never 
been given a specific reason for why she has been unable to get an 
exit visa 
she also said she never engaged in secret work for the 
government which foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze has said 
is the sole legitimate reason that can cause rejection of an 
application to leave the soviet union 
last year as relations between the soviet union and the west 
improved more than 8000 soviet jews were permitted to emigrate 
nearly eight times as many as the year before and the highest total 
since 1981 
among those who have left in recent months are longtime jewish 
activists and refuseniks josef begun vladimir slepak and ida 
nudel jewish activists say thousands if not tens of thousands of 
jews want to emigrate but have been turned down

city planners thought they had the 
perfect solution when a developer sought to build homes next to a 
marsh where endangered species of mice and birds live ban all cats 
from the homes 
but that was before the cat lovers began phoning and one city 
council member says hell bring up the issue at next mondays 
council meeting 
its unconstitutional said city councilman gary frugoli 
well be the laughingstock of everybody 
its ridiculous that the citys trying to restrict people from 
having animals he said how do we enforce it are we going 
to have police officers out there checking to see if they have 
cats 
but its not so ridiculous countered city planning director 
anne moore who said the city imposed the ban at the suggestion of 
the us fish and wildlife service 
the homes are to be built near swampy grasslands by gallinas 
creek in this suburb about 20 miles north of san francisco the 
swampland is home to the salt marsh harvest mouse and the clapper 
rail bird both of which are on state and federal endangered 
species lists 
permits for the 224home development were issued march 29 after 
the city planning commission approved construction on condition 
that felines be banned 
theres definitely a logic to this ms moore said this 
is the mouse that has stopped development all over san francisco 
bay when it is found in an area where development is proposed 
ray royce chief of subdivisions in the california real estate 
department said the cat ban could be the first in the nation to 
affect private homes 
i dont know of a similar proposal he said 
the developer southwest diversified had no problems with the 
ban 
its a reasonable compromise between the environment and the 
need for housing said richard garlinghouse senior vice president 
of southwest diversified twenty years ago we would have simply 
gone in and bulldozed 
the executive said he has agreed that a section of land that 
lies between the housing project and the marsh will remain wild as 
sort of a buffer zone 
ms moore who acknowledges getting some irate phone calls from 
cat lovers praised the developer for being very sensitive to the 
environmental situation it was not an issue with the developer 
they said fine 
gail kobetich field supervisor of the federal wildlife 
services sacramento endangered species office said that cats 
are one of our major concerns theyre predators 
negotiations aimed at saving the endangered mouse are going on 
over several planned developments on the east and south sides of 
san francisco bay said kobetich 
we generally arrive at a reasonable solution he said

a marine guarding a petroleum storage area 
near a us military base in panama was shot and killed apparently 
by fellow marines while investigating an alleged intrusion by 
panamanian forces into the area a pentagon official said today 
this petroleum tank farm has been the site of a series of 
intrusions in the recent past which resulted in increased 
vigilance and patrol said pentagon spokesman dan howard 
the purpose of the intrusions and the exact identity of the 
intruders were not clear he said 
the facility stores fuel for us airplanes and vehicles at 
nearby howard air force base he said 
when one has intruders into the base perimeter who are in 
uniform and are camouflaged the assumption that one comes to is 
that of course they are pdf or members of the panamanian 
defense force said howard 
no intruders were apprehended in the confusion of the firing 
the intruders all escaped said us air force col ron sconyers 
a spokesman at us southern command 
the marine was identified as cpl ricardo m villahermosa 25 
of santurce puerto rico he was part of i company 3rd battalion 
4th marine regiment part of the 6th marine expeditionary brigade 
and was sent from camp lejeune nc to panama as part of a 
strengthened security force last week officials said 
villahermosa was struck by at least one shot in the abdomen and 
was pronounced dead at gorgas hospital in panama 
attempts to revive the marine with openheart massage were 
unsuccessful several major arteries were hit by the bullet and the 
marine suffered massive internal bleeding sconyers said 
describing the incident as a tragic accident howard told 
reporters at the pentagon that it occurred after an apparent 
intrusion by six or eight individuals into the tank farm area 
us security forces patrolling the area split up and were in 
the process of rejoining when a trip flare was set off sounding 
like gunfire he said 
in response two elements of the patrol fired seven rounds 
were discharged before the onthescene commander ordered a 
ceasefire initial indications are that the fatal gunshot wound was 
not the result of hostile gunfire but rather the result of a 
crossfire from the us shots fired he said 
details of the incident are sketchy at this time he said 
and the matter is under investigation 
in another accident two us army uh60a blackhawk helicopters 
carrying a total of eight soldiers collided during a night training 
exercise at an airstrip at fort sherman in panama howard said 
the soldiers were conducting routine training involving 
familiarization with nightvision devices immediately prior to the 
crash at about 1045 pm edt monday night said the spokesman 
the soldiers assigned to the first battalion 228 aviation 
regiment in panama were treated for minor injuries he said 
the accident came just over a month after two uh60 helicopters 
collided during a night training mission and crashed 250 feet to 
the ground killing 17 servicemen near fort campbell army air field 
in kentucky 
the blackhawk is one of the armys newest helicopters but has 
been grounded several times last summer officials said that about 
40 people had been killed in crashes of the helicopter since 1978

michael dukakis and albert gore jr traded barbs in a new york 
debate tuesday on the middle east welfare cuts and timidity in 
dealing with fellow democrat jesse jackson republican george bush 
said he cant wait to take on one of them in the fall campaign 
a week before the pivotal new york primary the democratic 
battle was turning into a bloodletting bush said as he moved 
sedately toward the gop nomination that is all but his 
were warming up for the fall race the vice president said 
before tossing out the first ball for a new york metsmontreal 
expos game at shea stadium 
i still intend to campaign right through the end of the 
primary season bush said in schenectady i cant wait to take 
on whichever one of those three democrats wins the democratic 
nomination 
the balloting in new york next tuesday is a foregone conclusion 
for the republicans but for the democrats the primary offers rich 
prizes and harsh judgments 
for jackson it offers another chance to prove he can attract 
white votes and continue the growth of a mainstream campaign 
i was an underdog for 45 years and 11 months and now im one 
of the top dogs and i just love it jackson said in the new york 
daily news debate new york loves a winner and im a winner 
vote for a winner vote for jackson action 
dukakis the frontrunner in the polls is hoping to make it 
three primary victories in a row and stretch out his delegate lead 
with the lions share of the 255 new york delegates at stake 
on tuesday in the ap delegate count dukakis has 75015 votes 
jackson 7131 gore 3968 and uncommitted 5067 
in search of the 2082 votes needed to win the nomination at the 
democratic national convention in july dukakis said he was seeking 
delegates who supported candidates who have dropped out and even 
maybe for al gores delegates 
dont lick your chops too soon gov dukakis gore fired 
back in the debate new yorks going to have a bigger say about 
that than you will 
gore trailing badly in the polls must do well in the april 19 
primary just to keep his campaign alive 
as he has in past debates the tennessee senator landed the 
first punches in the confrontation one of several scheduled before 
tuesdays balloting 
hitting on the middle east a key issue in new york gore said 
dukakis had sounded a note of enthusiasm about an independent 
palestinian state and he said he disagreed with the way jesse 
jackson advocates a palestinian state 
thats not a personal attack gore concluded 
dukakis retorted that gore was just wrong i didnt express 
enthusiasm for a palestinian state yesterday he said 
for his part jackson did not back down from his support for a 
palestinian homeland while we can guarantee secure borders we 
cannot insure tranquility so long as there is occupation 
then the massachusetts governor brought up gores attacks on him 
a week ago 
i think we can disagree without suggesting anyone is attacking 
anyone dukakis said and al i think i heard you correctly 
when you were attacking me for not attacking jesse thats the 
first time thats happened in 25 years 
with jackson watching the exchange gore retorted what i said 
was you were timid in not being willing to say why you believed you 
would make a better president than jesse jackson 
dukakis would not let gore have the last word no you said i 
was timid because i would not attack this man first time thats 
happened 
earlier this month gore attacked dukakis for being absolutely 
timid in his comments about jackson and said dukakis was afraid 
to say a single word about jesse jackson 
on welfare gore said dukakis recently recommended very very 
deep cuts in aid to welfare recipients in massachusetts youre 
wrong youre wrong dukakis said 
the massachusetts governor proposed a 55 percent increase in 
state spending next year for aid to families with dependent 
children only enough to keep up with inflation 
without a serious opponent for the gop nomination bush 
campaigned across new york saying he was running against the 
ghost of jimmy carter and saying there is little difference 
between the 1988 democratic contenders 
do you want americans to go back to those terrible days of 
malaise and darkness he asked in a speech at a syracuse shopping 
mall 
thats exactly what wed have if we ended up electing one of 
them bush told reporters 
pressed by reporters as to why he was attacking carter who has 
been out of office for more than seven years bush replied 
because the policies of the democrats will take us right back 
to the high interest rates and the doubledigit inflation of the 
carter years 
bush also made a pitch for black voters saying the gop offers 
more hope than some of those ageold democratic answers that have 
failed a lot of blacks have voted the straight lever voted 
automatically for democrats and whats it gotten them taken for 
granted over and over again

the reagan administration urged the united 
nations on tuesday to organize a multinational drive to help 
millions of afghan refugees return in safety and honor when 
soviet troops withdraw 
the united states is prepared to aid the effort but the 
united nations and its specialized agencies are the logical 
organizations to coordinate the job state department spokesman 
charles e redman said 
more than 5 million afghans have fled to neighboring countries 
mostly pakistan during the eightyear war that has pitted the 
afghan government and soviet troops against usbacked guerrilla 
forces 
now that soviet forces are to leave the country by early next 
year under an agreement to be signed in geneva on thursday the 
return of the displaced afghan population is emerging as one of the 
next difficult regional issues to be settled 
adding to the difficulty is the likelihood of continued fighting 
after the departure of soviet troops because both superpowers have 
reserved the right to keep aiding the warring factions 
redman referring to further settlement talks led by united 
nations mediator diego cordovez said a constructive effort is 
taking place to work out an interim government and to help the 
refugees return in safety and honor 
he said there was no timetable for the return of the refugees 
and added 
this process has to be done in such a way that its done 
securely that these people are taken care of there is obviously 
going to be some social disorganization inside afghanistan as this 
proceeds we need to try to do this in a coordinated way 
pakistan though which much of the us aid to the afghan 
resistance has been funneled is especially eager for the return of 
the refugees from border regions that have been made unstable by 
the war 
state department officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
said they hoped for the earliest possible return of the refugees 
but were concerned about the impact further fighting in the country 
would have on resettlement 
they also said the withdrawal of soviet forces from the country 
could touch off a massive desire among the refugees to trek home 
the likelihood of continued violence does not frighten the 
afghan people one official said what made them flee in the 
first place was not violence it was the magnitude of the violence 
namely attacks from the soviet air force napalm attacks 
helicopter raids on villages 
when that ends they will want to return the official said 
under the afghan accords the soviets will withdraw their troops 
by feb 15 1989 the refugees will return and afghanistan will 
become an independent nonaligned nation 
the united states and the soviet union have agreed between 
themselves nevertheless to continue aiding their clients in the 
country 
redman said that agreement has been clarified in private 
communications between secretary of state george p shultz and 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and will be 
reinforced in statements by the two when they attend the signing 
ceremony in geneva 
some us conservatives led by sen gordon j humphrey rnh 
have said they are concerned nonetheless that us acceptance of 
the afghan accord is a signal of flagging reagan administration 
support for the resistance forces 
a group of conservatives met the president tuesday to express 
those concerns 
we think the administration is well intentioned but we 
question the results paul weyrich president of the free 
congress foundation told reporters after the meeting 
weyrich said the conservatives told reagan that pakistan is 
going to have a very difficult time helping supply any new aid 
because the accord calls for noninterference by pakistan as well 
as the soviet union 
reagan reminded the group that he had received personal 
assurances from pakistani president mohammed zia ulhaq of their 
willingness to take the heat and the willingness to continue 
supplying the resistance forces weyrich said 
the president told us repeatedly and in very definitive terms 
that he is going to stand by the afghan freedom fighters no matter 
what weyrich said

senate majority leader robert c byrd 
announced today he will not run for the leadership post next year 
and will instead seek the chairmanship of the senate 
appropriations committee if he is reelected to a sixth term and 
the democrats retain control of the senate 
byrd dwva announced his intentions at a private meeting of 
senate democrats and in a twoway satellite hookup between 
washington and west virginia state college in institute 
the decision of byrd who has been either the senates majority 
or minority leader for the last 12 years opens up a race for the 
senates most powerful and influential post among the senates 54 
democrats assuming senate control remains in their hands 
byrd said that as appropriations committee chairman he would 
have an opportunity to help his state which he said has suffered 
under the reagan administrations economic policies 
now for the first time i have a new opportunity to have a 
more direct influence on the allocation of our nations scarce 
fiscal resources byrd said 
at this point in time i believe i can best serve the people 
of my state by becoming chairman of the appropriations committee 
he said 
since the democrats reclaimed control of the senate in 1986 and 
byrd reclaimed the title of majority leader it had been rumored 
that he would step down at the end of this term 
he said earlier that the appropriations chairmanship would put 
him in a better position to constantly see something that might 
be put into west virginia and to influence it going there 
several political leaders in west virginia had urged byrd this 
week to choose the powerful appropriations chairmanship saying he 
could do more for the state there than he could as majority leader 
three senators who are the leaders in the race to succeed byrd 
daniel inouye of hawaii j bennett johnston of louisiana and 
george mitchell of maine all confirmed that they are actively 
campaigning for the job and several members said there was no 
clear frontrunner 
this is senator byrds day said mitchell the emphasis 
ought to be on his contribution 
asked whether he was seeking the top job inouye said yes i 
will as to whether he had the votes to win the senator said 
they look good 
inouye said he did not believe any residual criticism of his 
performance as chairman of the senate irancontra investigating 
panel last summer would be a problem to his bid 
johnston said byrd had announced his retirement from the 
majority leader post in a very eloquent statement which 
received sustained applause from party members 
asked whether he believed he had the votes johnston said i 
hope to have them i do not now no one does i just became a 
candidate 
one who had been thought a possible candidate sen dale 
bumpers dark said he would not make the race im one of 54 
whos not running he said 
senate democrats will elect their leader late this year 
following the november elections that will determine whether they 
retain control of the senate 
sen frank lautenberg dnj said byrds retirement as 
democratic leader portends a new era 
lautenberg called byrd who has been known for his mastery of 
senate rules but somewhat dry leadership style a very effective 
leader but said he did not necessarily think a successor will 
follow in the same vein 
what well be looking for in the leader is perhaps someone 
with less knowledge of the process but hopefully able to do it 
differently the time for change i think is appropriate 
lautenberg said he did not believe seniority would be the key 
factor in the leadership race 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said i have all the respect 
for senator byrd over the period of time he has served as majority 
leader and minority leader he made this judgment for the best 
interests of the nation and the senate 
byrd will be 71 on nov 20 he came to the senate 30 years ago 
and cultivated a reputation as a master at the legislative game a 
courtly strategist who gained power by attending to his colleagues 
smallest wishes 
in 1971 byrd called in his favors and orchestrated a major coup 
by ousting kennedy for the no 2 party post of assistant leader or 
majority whip he was a loyal aide to majority leader mike 
mansfield and was easily elected to succeed him in 1976

attorney general edwin meese iii neglected to 
tell an fbi agent investigating the wedtech scandal of discussions 
about filling a key justice department post with meeses longtime 
friend wedtech consultant e robert wallach the attorney 
generals lawyer said tuesday 
meese was interviewed in the wedtech probe by the fbi on april 
17 1987 just over a week after being informed that wallach was 
under criminal investigation in the matter a week or so before 
being notified of wallachs status meese had asked wallach whether 
he was interested in becoming counselor to meese at the justice 
department 
meese lawyer james rocap said that an fbi agent on april 17 
asked meese a question that was broad enough to elicit the 
counselor job but meese at the time was focusing on an earlier 
period and perceived the question to relate to whether wallach 
considered taking a job during meeses early tenure as attorney 
general in 1985 
meese thought about the fbi interview over the weekend and the 
following week on his own initiative informed the agent of the 
counselor job discussions 
he didnt make a conscious decision during the fbi interview 
to withhold the information said rocap when he talked to the 
agent a second time meese also informed the fbi that he and 
wallach had discussed possibly creating an advisory commission in 
1986 on which wallach would serve to examine the administration of 
the justice department and to suggest possible changes the 
commission was never formed 
meese wanted wallach to join the justice department last spring 
despite the growing wedtech scandal that eventually led to 
wallachs indictment on racketeering charges 
the attorney general knew at the time that wallach was a witness 
in the wedtech case said rocap 
but it wasnt until april 8 1987 that the attorney general was 
notified formally under an administrative mechanism involving the 
fbi that wallach was a subject of the criminal investigation into 
wedtech corp by us attorney rudolph giuliani in manhattan the 
fbi interview of meese was part of giulianis probe wallach was 
indicted on racketeering charges in the wedtech scandal last 
december he has pleaded innocent

the bureau of land management said tuesday it 
is going to decide whether recent allegations of cruelty to animals 
should mean an end to its practice of giving away large numbers of 
wild horses 
were putting the largescale adoptions under an intensive 
review blm spokesman tim locke said but he declined to confirm 
a report that the nofee largeherd adoption program had been 
suspended 
since the mid1970s the bureau has offered for adoption the 
wild horses taken in its roundups from the western range on payment 
of 125 
use of the term adoption is really a marketing tool since 
after a year the bureau gives the foster parent title to the 
horse 
since 1984 the bureau has waived the fee for people willing to 
take 100 animals or more 
locke said the review was prompted by recent allegations of 
abuse including one at sheyenne nd where earlier this month 
bureau officials reclaimed what was left of a herd of 400 horses on 
a ranch there 
fortytwo horses were missing and 87 had died mostly of 
dehydration or starvation 
the grand forks nd herald last week quoted john boyles head 
of the bureaus wild horse and burro division as saying were 
not approving any more than those already approved 
both boyles and robert burford director of the bureau were 
traveling tuesday and unavailable for comment locke would say 
only the instruction memo has not been issued largescale 
adoptions are still in our regs 
locke said burford would take up the question when he returns 
last year the bureau transferred 8600 horses to private 
caretakers in largeherd nofee adoptions these are generally 
horses that no one has taken in individual adoptions and 
frequently undesirable because older horses are more difficult to 
break 
about 5000 horses a year are adopted by individuals 
the bureau has to round up horses to keep them from eating so 
much forage that cattle cannot graze on the range it previously 
killed the surplus animals but it abandoned that practice in 1982 
following protests by animal rights groups

former democratic presidential nominee george 
mcgovern told jewish voters in new york on tuesday that jesse 
jackson is neither antisemitic nor antiisrael and should not be 
judged on the indiscretions of an earlier time 
it is not worthy of the great traditions of judaism for its 
adherents to been seen as unforgiving toward a black man who is 
extending the hand of reconciliation and peace mcgovern said in 
a statement 
as the 1972 democratic presidential nominee called for 
peacemaking however leaders of two major jewish groups slammed 
jacksons campaign manager for saying they wanted to meet with 
jackson simply to harass him 
the statement by jackson aide gerald austin is false 
unfortunate and offensive said malcolm hoenlein executive 
director of the conference of presidents of major american jewish 
organizations 
in view of his theme of healing we are dismayed that the 
jackson campaign seems to have made a decision not to meet with the 
leadership of the new york jewish community said lester pollack 
president of the jewish community relations council of new york 
even as the invitation to speak was issued again 
jackson alone among the three remaining major democratic 
candidates has not accepted the invitation of the two groups to 
speak before the april 19 new york primary jewish voters usually 
account for up to onequarter of the democratic primary voters in 
the state 
the conference of presidents is made up of 44 national jewish 
groups the council is a coordinating body for 59 jewish 
organizations in the new york metropolitan area 
mcgovern sought to reduce some of the tensions by writing what 
he called an open letter to the jewish voters of new york he 
said he is not endorsing jackson 
i have no doubt that jesse jackson is free of antisemitism 
a bigotry totally at odds with his years of passionate devotion to 
civil rights mcgovern wrote i do not want to see this 
steadily improving political leader judged on the indiscretions of 
an earlier time rather than the more mature conduct he demonstrates 
today 
three items in particular were addressed by mcgovern jacksons 
views on the middle east his earlier association with the 
intemperate louis farrakhan and a slurring reference to new york 
city as hymietown 
i fully understand the concerns of jews on these matters 
indeed four years ago i took public issue with jesse because of 
this mcgovern said 
during his 1984 campaign jackson referred to new york as 
hymietown and jews as hymie in what he thought was a private 
conversation 
with reference to the hymietown slur jackson has long ago 
expressed his regrets over this unfortunate language mcgovern 
wrote he also clearly ended his association with farrakhan some 
years ago 
farrakhan the leader of the nation of islam referred to 
judaism as a gutter religion in 1984 when he was a jackson 
backer 
on the middle east mcgovern said that jacksons positions are 
not extreme that he can be a reconciling force in that 
hateridden region 
if i were a jew with special concerns for israel i would not 
be disturbed by jesse jacksons positions mcgovern said 
the 1972 nominee said that jacksons convictions are close to 
those of some israeli leaders he named abba eban eser weisman 
and shimon peres 
it is true that jackson has met with plo leader yasser arafat 
favors direct negotiations between palestinians and the israelis 
supports the concept of selfdetermination for palestinians and the 
exchange of israelioccupied territory for peace mcgovern said 
these position with which i agree do not threaten israel quite 
the contrary they are essential conditions of justice and a secure 
peace for israelis as well as palestinians

presidential press secretary james brady and 
his wife sarah asked congress on tuesday to expand home health care 
and other services vital to head injury victims describing vividly 
their own plight since brady was shot 
my name is jim brady i am a sevenyear survivor of a 
traumatic brain injury brady said evenly as a hush fell over the 
packed senate hearing room i know only too well the tragedy 
surrounding a head injury i am pleased that you are taking a keen 
look at our problems 
brady was shot during the 1981 assassination attempt on 
president reagan and at one point was reported dead he delivered 
his brief statement to the senate labor and human resources 
subcommittee on the handicapped from a wheelchair with little 
expression in his face or voice 
though clearly not fully recovered brady demonstrated during 
his wifes testimony that his famous sense of humor survives in 
some form 
speaking as a family member i can tell you that going through 
that initial trauma is surely difficult but somehow you do mrs 
brady said 
it was difficult for me too brady interjected dryly 
winning a roar of laughter from the audience which included many 
head trauma victims 
mrs brady said brady had received firstrate care even down to 
a 24hour secret service guard by his hospital room door that 
was so i couldnt sneak out brady interrupted 
the rude shock came when brady was released from the hospital 
and there was no support network his wife said she said she felt 
trepidation about facing the situation alone and had no one with 
whom to discuss the best way to handle bradys rehabilitation 
under questioning mrs brady said her familys no 1 need is 
for home care for her husband who cannot be left alone during a 
short shopping trip much less the many hours of a fulltime workday 
jim for example is not able to get out of a chair by himself 
and would not be able to leave our home in the event of a fire 
she said its very frustrating to see that home health care is 
not always covered by government or private insurance 
mrs brady said families and survivors also need support and 
counseling programs to cope with the tragedy that has shattered so 
many lives children parents spouses and the victims themselves 
she said the shooting has had a devastating impact on bradys 
elderly mother and his 9yearold son as for brady himself she 
said he laughs and keeps a sense of humor up but i know that he 
thinks daily of what he could have been doing

premierdesignate ciriaco de mita received final 
approval from coalition members tuesday to form italys 48th 
postworld war ii government and said he would present his cabinet 
list to the president 
the christian democrat leader told reporters all the problems 
are resolved in negotiations to form another fiveparty 
government 
de mita 60 indicated he would go to the quirinal palace on 
wednesday to present his list of cabinet ministers to president 
francesco cossiga thus formally ending the monthlong government 
crisis 
the coalition is to be made up of the same parties that have 
governed off and on since 1981 the christian democrats 
socialists social democrats republicans and liberals 
leaders of the parties gave their final endorsement of de mitas 
plan on tuesday 
crucial support came from the socialists the secondlargest 
party in the coalition and a frequent critic of the dominant 
christian democrats 
giovanni di michelis a socialist representative said the party 
will participate in a loyal and constructive way 
but the top socialist leader former premier bettino craxi 
predicted rough going for the new government 
he was asked if de mitas government could last through the end 
of the legislative term in 1992 and replied it would be a 
miracle 
craxi said the new coalition was based on the same foundation as 
that led by premier giovanni goria a christian democrat who 
resigned on march 11 after eight turbulent months in office 
goria said he would not join the new government as a minister 
christian democrat giulio andreotti is expected to remain as 
foreign minister and liberal valerio zanone as defense minister 
after presenting his cabinet list to cossiga de mita will seek 
a confidence vote in parliament where the coalition holds a 
comfortable majority in both houses the vote is expected next week 
de mita cleared the final hurdle when the parties agreed on 
proposed antitrust legislation for the italian media under the 
accord no individual or group can own or control both a newspaper 
and a television network 
if the legislation is passed private television magnate silvio 
berlusconi will have to give up his milan newspaper il giornale 
while the fiat automaking company will have to drop plans to expand 
into television 
fiat owns the newspaper la stampa of turin and controls the 
rizzoli publishing group that includes the corriere della sera 
newspaper of milan and the sports daily gazzetta dello sport 
the socialists had sought to gain equal management control of 
the staterun rai television network headed by a christian 
democrat but that was rejected by de mita 
on the issue of nuclear power the parties put off a final 
decision on the fate of the unfinished nuclear plant at montalto di 
castro near rome the socialists had insisted the plant be 
converted to another form of energy production the christian 
democrats favor completing the nuclear station

viewers tuning in to watch cher and her 
eyepopping dress helped the academy awards show reverse a ratings 
decline and rack up its biggest television audience in four years 
fans who stuck out the full three hour 33minute telecast 
monday night also saw the last emperor filmed amid the 
imperial splendor of beijings forbidden city sweep all nine 
awards for which it was nominated 
during prime time from 911 pm edt when the networks are 
competing against each other the 60th annual academy awards show 
on abc had a rating of 301 and a 47 share last year the show 
rated 275 and a 43 share the rating is a percentage of the 
nations 886 million homes with television the share is a 
percentage of sets in use 
it was the highestrated oscars since 1984 when the live 
hollywood extravaganza had a rating of 303 and a 50 share 
abc estimated that 80 million viewers saw all or part of this 
years show 
im staggered i dont know what to say about it producer 
samuel goldwyn jr said tuesday of the ratings 
goldwyn said despite the ratings success he is bowing out after 
two years as the oscar show producer 
there are a lot more people in this town more talented than i 
who should try he said i wish the next guy luck 
chers sheer sequined bob mackiedesigned dress left little to 
the imagination when she won the best actress oscar for 
moonstruck another bestactress nominee sally kirkland 
showed up in a black gown with a deep plunging neckline 
the other acting winners were michael douglas best actor for 
wall street sean connery best supporting actor for the 
untouchables and olympia dukakis best supporting actress for 
moonstruck 
the last emperor writerdirector bernardo bertoluccis 
story of chinas boy ruler won best picture best director and 
best adapted screenplay for the italian director and collaborator 
mark peploe 
goldwyn said tuesday he arranged the shows sequences on a hunch 
the last emperor might sweep the awards 
i knew the big thing was to program against it the sweep by 
giving entertainment for people while watching a rout he said 
when i saw it get the editing award i knew that was it 
oscar gold may translate into boxoffice silver for the last 
emperor ticket sales increased last weekend by 49 percent and 
columbia pictures added 74 screens to the movies distribution 
apparently in anticipation of oscar victories 
the movie so far has earned only 251 million in us box 
office compared with three men and a baby which has earned 
1567 million 
the oscar show directed by marty passetta came in the second 
month of a strike by the 9000 members of the writers guild of 
america a writing team led by exwga president mel shavelson 
stopped work on the script and never returned to it after the 
strike began march 7 
the relocation of the oscars to the cavernous shrine auditorium 
caused logistical problems including a monumental traffic jam that 
forced some stars to leave their limousines and walk rather than 
miss the show 
best actress nominees meryl streep and glenn close who is nine 
months pregnant were spotted hiking up jefferson boulevard in 
their oscar finery 
it was the first oscar show at the shrine in 40 years the site 
was chosen because of its 6300seat auditorium nearly double the 
number available in the dorothy chandler pavilion where the show 
has been staged for the past several years 
goldwyn said the bigger audience helped the ambiance of the 
awards 
the audience was very warm the standing ovations were a 
knockout we didnt expect that the audience was much looser than 
at the dorothy chandler 
the academy confirmed tuesday that another name should be added 
to the list of oscar winners 
set directors bruno cesari and osvaldo desideri shared as 
cowinners in set direction for the last emperor said academy 
spokeswoman marci blaze desideris name was inadvertently omitted 
from the original list of nominees

blacks and whites joined in 
paying tribute to alan paton the countrys most renowned author 
and an outspoken advocate of racial justice who died tuesday at the 
age of 85 
paton whose novel cry the beloved country became one of 
the worlds bestknown depictions of apartheid died of throat 
cancer at his estate outside the port city of durban a day after he 
was released from a hospital to spend his last hours at home 
he went peacefully happy to have been in his own bed said 
his wife anne 
with his passing an era has ended and our beloved country 
cries enos mabuza leader of the black homeland of kwangane 
said of the white author who was also a prison administrator 
commentator politician and public speaker 
paton was the champion of south africas oppressed a 
visionary who campaigned for peace for freedom within the rule of 
law and justice for all he said 
cry the beloved country published in 1948 tells the story 
of a zulu priest in search of his son who is being sought by 
police for the murder of a white man it has sold 15 million copies 
in 20 languages and was made into a musical lost in the stars 
by composer kurt weill and playwright maxwell anderson only the 
bible outsells his book in south africa 
i have one great fear in my heart says the main black 
character at the end of the book one day when they the whites 
have turned to loving they will find we are turned to hating 
that passage has been quoted often by anglican archbishop 
desmond tutu the prominent antiapartheid campaigner and nobel 
peace laureate 
president pw botha said of paton although he was a noted 
critic of the government he was respected for his sincerity never 
failing to temper his criticism with a recognition of positive 
developments and the realities of the situation 
paton wrote only four works of fiction but campaigned 
unrelentingly against apartheid under which the white minority 
excludes blacks from national politics and restricts them to 
segregated neighborhoods schools and hospitals 
paton vowed to keep silent after the 1968 banning of the 
multiracial liberal party he helped found but he began speaking 
out publicly again in the early 1980s 
prior to his first novel paton served for 13 years as principal 
of diepkloof reformatory a home for 650 delinquent black boys aged 
10 to 21 outside johannesburg

high walls no latrines and a staff that considered its main job to 
be guard duty 
when paton left diepkloof in 1948 the barbed wire was gone and 
it had the lowest escape rate in the country he became known as 
the man who pulled up the barbed wire and planted geraniums 
in his later years paton was regarded as the elder statesman of 
south africas liberals some antiapartheid groups considered him 
too conservative and he was tolerated by national party supporters 
who once considered him a traitor for his writings 
save the beloved country a compilation of some of his 
articles and speeches was published in january 
journey continued a sequel to his autobiography toward 
the mountain is due out at the end of april the sequel focuses 
on people with whom paton worked in the early days of the 
antiapartheid movement

democrat michael dukakis campaigned in a 
conservative jewish community tuesday declining to criticize rival 
jesse jackson despite shouted invitations from some in the crowd 
dukakis seeking jewish support in next tuesdays new york 
presidential primary met privately with jewish leaders in the 
borough park neighborhood of brooklyn and later spoke to hundreds 
of hassidic and orthodox jews who filled the street outside 
it was the second day of meetings with jewish leaders for the 
massachusetts governor who came to the neighborhood just hours 
after facing rivals albert gore jr and jackson in a locally 
televised debate 
gore earlier had said dukakis has shown enthusiasm for 
creation of a palestinian state in the middle east something some 
jewish leaders oppose dukakis denied that during the debate 
as dukakis took questions from reporters in brooklyn some young 
hassidic jews in the crowd shouted to him asking what he thought 
about jackson who has drawn the ire of some jews for his 
positions regarding palestinians in the occupied west bank and for 
his 1984 reference to new york as hymietown 
i have some disagreements with rev jackson i have some 
disagreements with sen gore dukakis said to reporters im 
going to run a strong campaign that puts my best foot forward 
in the hope i can win suppport of the people of new york 
dukakis referred to his own heritage as the son of greek 
immigrants and praised the largely jewish community as a model of 
what a caring community is all about a recognition that were all 
in this together 
new yorks primary campaign has focused on middle east issues 
reflecting the fact that jews generally make up close to 
onequarter of the democratic primary electorate 
dukakis said he also planned to campaign in black and hispanic 
communities and he went from brooklyn to a health clinic in a 
predominantly hispanic section of new york citys upper west side 
there he talked of his commitment to basic health insurance and day 
care addressing several dozen people most of them women who work 
at the clinic and their children 
in borough park he was strongly endorsed by the councils 
leader rabbi morris schmidman who said a palestinian state would 
be a dagger at the heart and soul of israel dukakis has said a 
palestinian state should be a matter of negotiations for israel and 
its neighbors 
also appearing with him was the areas congressman rep stephen 
solarz he praised the work of dukakis wife kitty as a member of a 
national commission working to honor victims and survivors of the 
holocaust of which there are more survivors here in borough park 
and brooklyn than any other city in america 
the rabbi called dukakis the best choice and said i urge 
my friends to follow me in voting for him 
some in the crowd however expressed reservations 
daniel cohen a hebrew teacher said he was very vague in 
regard to israel i find him hazy 
several said they liked gore who has taken a strongly 
proisrael stance recently but they voiced concern that votes for 
gore would have the effect of enhancing jacksons position in the 
threeway primary

trigger the downfall of church and state a federal prosecutor said 
tuesday 
us attorney brent wards opening statement began the trial of 
four clan members facing charges relating to the jan 16 chapel 
bombing and a 13day standoff that ended jan 28 in gunfire that 
killed a state corrections officer 
in addition to opening statements the first witnesses were 
called to testify 
and us district judge bruce jenkins denied a defense motion to 
move the trial out of utah 
ward for the first time officially identified john timothy 
singer as the clan member authorities believe killed corrections 
lt fred house when officers attempted to capture clan leader addam 
swapp and his brother with attack dogs 
singer 21 son of clan matriarch vickie singer has not been 
charged in the death state authorities say they will file murder 
charges following the federal trial 
vickie singer and addam swapp made it clear there would be no 
surrender and that the nation church and state would have to be 
destroyed first said ward who detailed the bombing of the kamas 
stake center and the standoff at the clans marion homestead 
evidence and witnesses will show the events were part of a 
pattern of criminal activity having a common purpose ward said 
evidence will show in this case that addam swapp was the bomber 
you will hear evidence that this was more than just a bombing 
that it was an invitation to a violent confrontation ward said

from vickie singer 
john timothy singers attorney fred metos urged the jury to 
look closely at the attempted murder charge and determine whether 
his client had the malice and intent to kill 
the government he said must show that john timothy singer 
or whoever did the shooting at these officers had the specific 
intent to cause their death 
except he will tell you that he had no intention of harming 
anyone he just wanted to keep the dogs off his brotherinlaw and 
jonathan swapp metos said 
attorneys for the swapp brothers reserved their opening 
statements for later 
the government called its first two witnesses a couple who live 
across the highway from the bombed church building they testified

officials said tuesday that a 
juvenile court will try a lebanese man charged in a twa hijacking 
in which a us sailor was killed 
if convicted in the youth court mohammed hamadi would face a 
maximum 10year term he had been scheduled to go on trial next 
month as an adult and could have drawn a maximum life sentence 
in west germany defendants under 21 are tried in youth court 
hamadis 21st birthday came two days before the hijacking on june 
15 1985 according to the frankfurt state court 
however a possibility exists that the perpetration of the 
crime that he is accused of may have begun before june 13 1985 
and goes back to the time of his adolescence a court statement 
said 
therefore the case has been turned over to the youth court 
it said 
hamadi was charged in february with murder hostagetaking and 
other crimes stemming from the 1985 hijacking of a twa jetliner to 
beirut during which us navy diver robert stethem was killed and 
39 us citizens were held hostage for 17 days 
moving the case to a youth court means the news media could be 
barred from hamadis trial and proceedings may not begin for 
months authorities said 
judicial sources in frankfurt said they believed hamadis trial 
was not likely to start before the end of the year 
the hesse state youth court will now need time to study the 
case files before it can decide on when mohammed hamadis trial 
will start the court statement said 
a federal justice ministry spokesman who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the youth court could decide to exclude the press 
from hamadis trial he said the decision would not be made until 
the trial begins 
hamadi was arrested at frankfurt airport on jan 13 1987 
carrying liquid explosives and false documents 
last year the united states asked for hamadis extradition on 
air piracy and murder charges 
the west german government refused the request after the 
kidnapping in beirut of west germans rudolf cordes and alfred 
schmidt in january 1987 it said he would be tried in west germany 
instead 
defense attorneys in duesseldorf gave their closing arguments 
tuesday in the case of hamadis brother abbas 
abbas hamadi is charged with kidnapping the two west germans in 
an attempt to force west german authorities to release his brother 
schmidt was released by his captors in september in what they 
said was a goodwill gesture but cordes is still being held

the leaders of oftenfeuding factions in 
american aviation joined forces tuesday to fight for more airports 
and air traffic control support to meet the needs of commercial and 
private air transportation 
unless we modernize the air traffic system quickly well 
choke off growth to the detriment of all said robert crandall 
chairman of american airlines 
crandall was among five airline chief executives and leaders of 
groups representing aircraft manufacturers business flyers 
private and commercial pilots and airport officials who called a 
news conference to announce a new organization to promote the 
expansion of airspace and airport capacity 
the group calling itself partnership for improved air travel 
envisions spending up to 15 million over the next two years to 
publicize the need for more airports and an improve air traffic 
control system 
the executives said they hoped to enlist the support of the 
traveling public to pressure congress into providing more funds for 
an expansion of aviation capacity although some modest 
increase in aviation taxes might be needed most of the additional 
money would come from funds now bottled up in the federal aviation 
trust fund the coalition leaders said 
the reagan administration has denied repeatedly that any money 
is being held back and has argued that the surplus in the 5 
billion aviation trust fund is only temporary 
the group listed as founding members all of the major us air 
carriers aircraft manufacturers and 16 other organizations from 
aviation labor unions to airport operators 
the nation has not yet made a commitment to create an 
aviation system that can efficiently meet todays demand and 
anticipate tomorrows said herbert kelleher chairman both of 
southwest airlines and of the new coalition 
he and other airline executives said that unless the airspace 
and ground capacity is expanded flight delays and congestion will 
not only continue but become more serious each year the result 
will be governmentimposed constraints that will translate into 
higher air fares the executives suggested 
the coalition voiced many of the same complaints heard before 
from the aviation industry too few air traffic controllers are 
being hired and trained federal efforts to modernize the air 
traffic control technology is way behind schedule there are too 
few airports and the federal aviation administration needs to be 
restructured because it is hamstrung by bureacratic restrictions 
theres not enough manpower there are too few facilities 
equipment is outdated and the the air traffic systems management 
structure is illsuited to its mission said american airlines 
crandall 
kellerer alluded to the unique alliance that is represented 
by the coalition which includes not only the largest air carriers 
but also groups representing aviation labor and the pilots of 
small general aviation aircraft 
we all share a common ground in wanting to modernize the 
aviation system added kellerer 
transportation secretary jim burnley briefly address the group 
and acknowledged that the federal government cannot keep up with 
the rapidly changing industry spawned by airline deregulation 
we are illequipped to that kind of dynamic he said 
burnley in the past has called for congress to enact legislation 
that would allow the faa to streamline its procurement procedures 
and personnel policies so that they may better react to sudden 
changes in the aviation industry

a weary police chief billy prince said tuesday he 
is quitting a department in turmoil over public accountability the 
treatment of minorities and slayings of officers in a city he 
claims breeds cophaters 
prince came into office six years ago a young reformer but left 
an entrenched insider he tried to curb the use of deadly force but 
presided over one of the bloodiest times in department history 
before deciding the tension was too much 
i woke up easter sunday and just didnt feel good about 
returning prince said at a news conference i told my wife 
then i think its time for me to go 
prince 45 said he was stepping down immediately but would 
serve in an advisory role through the summer city manager richard 
knight appointed first assistant police chief louie c caudell as 
interim chief in the nations seventhlargest city 
in recent months prince had come under fire for criticizing 
city council members and opposing efforts to increase the 
accountability of a department embattled over recent police 
shootings of black residents 
at the request of local minority groups the us house 
subcommittee on criminal justice held a daylong hearing in may 
1987 into the departments use of deadly force but did not issue a 
report 
within minutes of princes announcement black city council 
members who have been critics of the department called for a black 
chief and insisted the new chief be an outsider caudell is white 
police and city leaders say prince leaves a legacy of tension 
that will mark the search for a new chief the continuing struggle 
over a citizens review board and perhaps even the 1989 race for 
mayor 
supporters of prince including one lawandorder city 
councilman already talking about running for mayor criticized 
mayor annette strauss and called the retiring chief a scapegoat who 
was hounded out of office 
the mayor denied prince was forced out and the 24year dallas 
police veteran said his decision to resign was totally my own 
monica smith head of the dallas police association said prince 
was a casualty of the recent deaths of several officers not of 
political infighting she saw more trouble on the horizon over 
princes successor 
the chief angered many opponents with an outburst in january 
after a homeless black vagrant shot white officer john glenn chase 
in a downtown parking lot 
he went on television to proclaim that city leaders criticism 
of his department had created a public so hostile that such a death 
was inevitable he then refused to back down even after strauss 
demanded an apology 
knight who is black also warned prince against making public 
remarks about the council 
the department already had been facing criticism for the police 
shootings of two black people 
a 70yearold black woman was shot to death by an officer 
responding to a burglary call at her home in october 1986 after 
prince fired the officer the dallas police association passed a 
no confidence vote on the chief 
police also shot dead a teenage black girl during a drug raid 
at an apartment complex in november 1987 
prince sharpened his differences with the city council last year 
when he lobbied against an expansion of the powers of the review 
board to evaluate the use of police force and the creation of a 
special office to review minority hirings and promotions the 
council introduced both changes in december 
the feud with the city council and the chase shooting has 
produced a backlash of support for the police and the dpa is 
seeking to go over the heads of council members and force a 
referendum on the review board

the troubled ptl ministry tried tuesday to 
auction the home used by former leaders jim and tammy bakker but 
there were no bidders for the plush milliondollar mansion 
the auction of that home and eight other properties chiefly 
homes used by other ministry officials raised only a fraction of 
the 4 million that ministry officials had hoped for 
the ministry accepted bids on five of the nine properties 
raising about 596500 the bakker home attracted no bids bids on 
two other properties were deemed insufficient and a 425000 bid 
on former ptl president richard dortchs home is still being 
considered said ptl trustee david clark 
clark said the setback means the ministry based in nearby fort 
mill will have to reexamine its options for raising 53 million 
by a may 2 bankruptcy court deadline 
i believe that we will make it in one way or another clark 
said 
the 9300squarefoot lakeside house used by the bakker and his 
wife before he resigned a year ago amid a sex scandal boasts three 
kitchens four bedrooms and 5 bathrooms 
the grounds include a twostory heated and airconditioned 
playhouse a guardhouse boardwalks to a white sandy beach on 
nearby lake wylie and a large dock where the bakkers once kept 
their 58foot houseboat and a small power cruiser 
it was built in 1976 and enlarged four times after ptl bought it 
in 1981 to be used as a parsonage by the bakkers and their two 
children 
auctioneer rodney l robinson opened the sale of the bakkers 
house by asking for 900000 he stopped the auction when his 
asking price fell to 500000 without any takers the house was 
valued at about 1 million 
we didnt get an offer that i thought was substantial enough 
to open the bidding robinson said afterward about 40 bidders 
participated in the 30minute auction 
one of the rejected bids was 900000 for 33 acres of 
undeveloped land clark said that property and no official cause has been 
given for the explosions that ripped 
through the ammunition depot sending rockets showering across the 
cities 
the los angeles times reported tuesday that agents from the 
prosoviet government in afghanistan were apparently responsible 
according to the newspaper the blast was caused by three 
incendiary devices carried to the ammunition dump by trucks bearing 
afghan license plates and equipped with time fuses they were 
exploded in sequence the newspaper said 
the newspaper quoting unidentified sources said pakistani 
military experts had told us officials that this was the cause of 
the blast 
unidentified us sources told the newspaper the explosions 
wiped out a major source of ciasupplied tactical assault weapons 
for guerrillas battling the sovietbacked government in afghanistan 
the pakistani cabinet chaired by prime minister mohammad khan 
junejo and the senate met tuesday to review the situation 
pakistani television said that during the cabinet meeting it 
was decided that a committee investigating the explosion should 
submit its findings with recommendations within 10 days and that 
they will be made public

satanic and ritualistic practices and beliefs 
may be a motivating factor in a one form of child abuse a 
childrens welfare group said tuesday 
people have now moved to a new level of how to assault 
children said dr daniel saxton of childhelp usa just abusing 
the child in the home is not enough weve gotten into this very 
sadistic kind of stuff with children 
saxton who is director of a childhelp hotline based his 
remarks on initial findings of a national study to determine the 
extent of cult involvement in specific abuse cases the results 
represent 36 separate cases documented by 59 questionnaires from 
16 states 
he said 97 percent of children reported male and female abusers 
50 percent described six or more perpetrators and more than 30 
percent told of more than 11 persons involved 
sixty percent of the children responding to the questionnaires 
indicated the incidents lasted from seven months to two years 
seventyeight percent of the children said they were 
photographed in the nude while more than 60 percent said they were 
photographed during sexual activity 
in twothirds of cases sexton said the children said they were 
drugged saw or participated in rituals animal killings and 
mutilations as part of the incident about half said they were 
taken to cemeteries and curches for these rituals 
roughly 46 percent of the children were forced to eat or drink 
bodily waste while a little more than 40 percent were forced to 
ingest what they were told was human flesh or blood 
although sexton said it would be premature to say the figures 
represent a national trend he is receiving calls from therapists 
nationwide about adult patients exhibiting behavior or 
experienceing dreams similar to those of some sexually abused 
children 
sexton told of an incident in which a therapist had a patient 
who remembered having a baby when she was 13 but could not 
remember what happened to the child 
two days later i get a call from this therapist saying good 
god this woman remembers having to kill her child he said 
sexton also mentioned that one of his adult patients who had been 
a sexual abuse victim from ages 12 through 16 gave birth to five 
children all of whom disappeared in the same manner 
childhelp usa is californiabased nonprofit organization that 
assists child abuse victims and their families through public 
education clinical programs research and its 24hour child abuse 
hotline 
according to the information from hotlines 148452 calls last 
year the incidence of sexual and physical child abuse is more than 
double that of the nationally accepted figures national statistics 
indicate 11 percent of abuse reports are sexual while 36 percent 
of the hotline calls were for sexual abuse 
similarily national figures indicate 155 percent of reported 
abuse is physical but calls for physical abuse totaled 37 percent 
of the hotline calls last year 
randall silverston childhelp research director said many 
children are being exposed to the threat of aids as a result of 
sexual abuse the organization and the university of california 
irvine were asking the national institutes of health to fund a 
threeyear study of those children who are in the highrisk 
category

federal housing officials plan to 
significantly increase the number of people getting vouchers to 
help pay their rent housing and urban development secretary samuel 
r pierce said tuesday 
the voucher program the reagan administrations alternative to 
building more public housing now assists about 100000 lowincome 
families with another 34000 to be added by the fall pierce told 
a house appropriations subcommittee 
hud plans to add another 100000 families in 1989 he said 
rather than subsidizing housing units the program gives poor 
families a voucher which can be used to pay a portion of the rent 
on living space they choose for themselves the value of the 
voucher is fixed according to each familys income leaving the 
amount of additional rent flexible the program was made permanent 
by congress last year 
vouchers give families the dignity of choice offering them 
the opportunity to locate near family and friends schools 
churches and jobs rather than in public housing projects said 
pierce he appeared before the subcommittee on hudindependent 
agencies to discuss his 216 billion budget request for fiscal 
1989 huds 1988 budget is 186 billion 
pierce said the number of households to be assisted by various 
hud programs would increase from 43 million in 1988 to 44 million 
next year 
subcommittee chairman rep edward p boland dmass questioned 
pierces conclusion that the major problem for lowincome families 
is not the availability of houses but their affordability boland 
said some studies show a severe shortage of lowincome housing as 
units built in the 1960s are converted into more profitable uses 
pierce quoted commerce department statistics putting rental 
vacancy rates at their highest in 20 years with an 84 percent 
vacancy rate among apartments renting between 200 and 249 a month 
boland also questioned huds estimate last week that it would 
take between 75 billion and 92 billion to bring the nations 
13 million public housing units up to modern safety and sanitation 
standards he said other estimates put the cost as high as 20 
billion 
rep bill green rny asked pierce if he is concerned that 
many middleincome people are being priced out of the housing 
market 
im not as disturbed as you because i dont see that it is 
such a big problem the secretary said 
pierce who is the only cabinet member still in office from 
among president reagans original appointees noted record sales 
and record housing starts in recent years somebodys buying the 
homes he said 
thomas demery assistant secretary for housing told the 
subcommittee several factors have affected middleclass families 
ability to buy homes including a decline in savings brought about 
partly by increased education costs 
meanwhile former developer james rouse told a senate 
subcommittee that congress should appropriate another 34 billion 
a year to support a federal program to increase the supply of 
lowincome and rental housing by the year 2000 
rouse who chaired an ad hoc committee which studied housing 
needs in the united states told a senate banking subcommittee that 
the nation faces the worst housing crisis in the past 10 years 
rouse who headed his own development company and now is 
chairman and chief executive officer of the enterprise foundation 
said the 34 billion would be added to the 136 billion currently 
available 
half of the 34 billion would be allocated to the states which 
would be required to match the funds by various means providing 
land or distributing money to local authorities the other half 
would go directly to cities which would have wide discretion for 
use of the funds but would not be required to match the money

world bank president barber conable on tuesday 
announced the formation of a worldwide body to insure private 
investors against loss from war and other hostile actions 
the flow of private investment must be strengthened conable 
told a news conference while saying investors put 16 billion into 
third world countries in 1981 and only 10 billion in 1987 
the new multilateral investment guarantee agency has 29 
countries which formally have accepted membership nine of them are 
industrial nations including the united states and britain whose 
ratifications arrived tuesday another 34 governments of both 
industrial and third world countries have signed the agreement but 
not yet ratified it 
so far ecuador is the only latin american government to ratify 
others including brazil argentina and mexico have not signed 
some latin american countries have a strong tradition against 
allowing foreigners any share in settling disputes with their 
citizens as might have to be done under the agreement setting up 
the agency 
conable said the new bodys governing council will hold its 
first meeting in washington on june 8 to adopt bylaws and choose a 
board of directors he said he expects the new agency to be doing 
business by the end of the year 
he added that after it is in operation it can take up a proposal 
that originated with japanese financer minister kiichi miyazawa to 
enable it to guarantee bank loans as well such operations would 
greatly broaden its scope and probably require more capital 
the object of the new agency is to attract more direct 
investment into third world countries to help them build the 
industries they need so they can produce more goods create jobs 
and make more payments on their debts new investments also would 
reduce the need to add to their existing debt now over 1 trillion 
it will begin with 108 billion but only 10 percent of that 
will be paid in cash by the member governments conable will be its 
president as well as heading the bank 
the agencys immediate future was assured when congress voted 
44 million for us participation at the end of last year the 
us contribution will be the largest 
the united states already has its own agency to insure american 
investors the overseas private investment corp migas services 
will be available to investors from all member countries citizens 
of a host country also can be protected if they bring home assets 
from abroad 
that provision is designed to help solve a major problem in 
third world nations the flight of billions of dollars that their 
citizens have sent to the united states and other havens considered 
safer than their own territory 
in addition to protecting investors against war and civil 
disturbances the agencys insurance policies will cut a companys 
losses if the government of a country where the money is invested 
restricts the right to take money out of the country expropriates 
property or repudiates a contract 
other risks also can be covered by a decision of the agencys 
board of directors

lawyers for lt col oliver l north and three 
codefendants charged in the irancontra affair urged a federal 
judge on tuesday to put off their trial until next year to give 
them sufficient time to prepare a defense 
attorneys for north along with former national security adviser 
john m poindexter and two arms dealers retired air force maj 
gen richard v secord and albert hakim objected to the 
prosecutions proposal to begin the trial in july instead 
proposing a march 1989 date 
we have a million documents in the case evelyn wood could not 
read those documents between now and july said norths attorney 
brendan v sullivan jr referring to the founder of the famous 
speedreading course 
there is no conceivable way of disposing of the many 
pretrial issues before early next year said sullivan who proposed 
that the trial begin two months after president reagan leaves 
office 
im frightened to have a trial during a political election 
year sullivan told us district judge gerhard a gesell 
gesell who said he was concerned about having the trial under 
way while ballots were being cast and independent counsel 
lawrence e walsh both proposed starting the trial in july 
walsh said the trial could take three or four months but 
defense lawyers suggested it could take even longer this is a 
difficult case walsh said but its not going to be made any 
easier by just putting off the trial date 
the possibility of a presidential pardon for north and 
poindexter was not mentioned at the hearing but it is widely 
believed that the defense would want to take advantage of such a 
possibility 
the white house has said reagan has not considered pardons but 
the president has repeatedly said he thought the defendants did 
nothing illegal 
at the outset of the hearing gesell said this case is not 
going to be on a slow track there is no need for it to be on a 
slow track 
but a number of obstacles to a summer trial were raised during 
the 3hour hearing the first since the four defendants were 
arraigned on charges they conspired to illegally divert profits to 
the nicaraguan contra rebels from the usiran arms sales 
these include the issue of whether walsh obtained evidence 
against the defendants from their compelled testimony to congress 
as well as a complicated procedure for government review of 300000 
classified documents that gesell ruled should be given to the 
defense 
unless those procedures can be streamlined were talking about 
a trial next year at the earliest gesell said 
walsh said he could make 50000 pages available by months end 
following a review of the sensitive documents by an interagency 
task force for material that might compromise us intelligence 
operations 
gesell expressed frustration at the detailed review procedure 
and warned that the case would be dismissed if the government 
doesnt declassify the documents needed by both the prosecution and 
defense 
the classification system must be adjusted to the needs of 
this case or the case will collapse gesell said 
the defendants should have the documents the judge said 
because they are entitled to show to the jury what motivated 
them why they did it who told them to do it and what was going 
on 
i have to allow them that chance to give them a fair trial 
gesell also invited a challenge to the constitutionality of the 
classified information procedures act when barry simon one of 
norths attorneys complained that the security measures the law 
prescribes would hamper defense preparation for trial 
gesell scheduled an april 25 hearing at which walsh will outline 
procedures followed by his office to prevent his staff from being 
exposed to the congressional testimony of the defendants 
the defense will get an opportunity at that time to present 
evidence that at least one witness gave grand jury testimony that 
was influenced by what the defendants told the house and senate 
committees that investigated the irancontra affair 
the law prohibits walsh from using the compelled congressional 
testimony of north poindexter and hakim as evidence against them 
unlike his codefendants secord testified on capitol hill without 
a grant of limited immunity from prosecution 
gesell warned that he will not proceed to trial unless he is 
satisfied that walsh obtained his evidence against the defendants 
independently of their congressional testimony 
if we dont have a case to be tried we are not going to try 
it the judge said 
earlier gesell scolded the prosecution for playing a cat and 
mouse game by delaying the production of documents he had ordered 
turned over to the defense 
were not here to play games said walsh who added that the 
defense already has received more than 30000 documents including 
the records of swiss bank accounts through which the arms sales 
were brokered

a hijacked jet left cyprus for algeria on 
wednesday carrying more than 30 hostages held for over a week by 
moslem gunmen demanding freedom for terrorists jailed in kuwait 
the blueandwhite boeing 747 took off at 117 am wednesday 
617 pm edt tuesday after the hijackers freed 12 hostages 
forty people were believed on board the aircraft after the 
latest release including a halfdozen hijackers the plane was 
seized a week ago by gunmen demanding freedom for 17 proiranian 
terrorists held in kuwait 
the plane was refueled after repeated demands by the hijackers 
who have killed two hostages in larnaca 
the freed passengers were driven from the boeing 747 at around 
1025 pm 325 pm edt then taken to larnaca general hospital 
reporters at the scene and hospital officials said 
a hijacker told the tower the released included two palestinians 
with jordanian passports and 10 others who were sick poor or had 
numerous children 
they said the releases were a goodwill gesture but added 
also that the jordanian nationals were freed as a present to the 
uprising in palestine a reference to four months of antiisraeli 
violence in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the planes engines started shortly after the latest passengers 
were released and loud bangs rang out across the tarmac officials 
said the noise was caused by the engines 
plo and government negotiators held talks with the hijackers 
before the latest hostages were being freed 
the hijackers said earlier in the day that they had on death 
shrouds one hijacker in a statement radioed to the larnaca 
airport control tower cited koranic verses usually read at 
funerals that said those killed in the name of god are always 
alive 
plo chairman yasser arafat was quoted today as saying the 
hijackers want to fly to algeria and arrangements are being made 
to this end the kuwait news agency said arafat told reporters in 
kuwait he expected the hijacking to end tonight 
in london iranian deputy foreign minister javad larijana said 
iran had offered to take the jet by force after it was forced to 
land in iran last week but kuwait rejected the idea 
at one point today the hijackers radioed the control tower 
demanding the plane be refueled in 45 minutes the deadline passed 
without incident after two palestine liberation organization 
officials went out on the tarmac and spoke with the hijackers 
one hijacker later radioed that they had extended the deadline 
for a short time to permit the mediators to act in getting 
the plane refueled 
we are warning against false promises he said in broken 
english 
when a c130 military transport landed a short time later one 
of the hijackers screamed over the radio identify this plane 
the tower replied it was a greek air force plane carrying 
supplies 
the hijacker replied my men were about to shoot at it 
the hijackers of the kuwait airways boeing 747 shot and killed a 
second passenger monday the hijackers are demanding kuwait free 17 
convicted terrorists and have said they want to leave for an 
unspecified neutral country 
the hijackers are armed with grenades and handguns they have 
repeatedly threatened to blow up the plane since the hijacking 
began a week ago 
the hijackers statement today indicated as had been suspected 
that the gunmen are shiite moslems 
the statement said hail the glory of imam mahdi the 
messiahlike holy person shiites believe will one day appear on 
earth only shiite moslems revere the imams or saints among the 
islamic sects 
the 17 proiranian terrorists whose freedom is sought by the 
hijackers were convicted in 1984 of bombing the us and french 
embassies in kuwait the emirate has rejected the demand all but 
one of the 17 are shiites 
among those on the plane are three members of kuwaits royal 
family a man and two women 
foreign minister sheik sabah alahmed alsabah of kuwait said 
monday his country is prepared to lose more hostages rather than 
give in 
we will try our utmost to protect our dear ones aboard the 
plane but we will not surrender to any blackmail even if we lose 
more of them he said he added that the presence of three 
members of the ruling alsabah family aboard the jet will not 
influence our decision 
terrorist groups in lebanon have threatened to kill foreign 
hostages they are holding including three americans if security 
forces storm the plane two of the americans are held by a group 
that also has demanded freedom for the 17 terrorists jailed in 
kuwait 
in todays statement the hijackers declared in classical 
koranic arabic we have decided to call our plane the plane of 
greatest martyrdom and death death with glory is better than life 
under humiliation we call on the kuwaiti people to revolt 
against the kuwaiti dictatorship wed like to point out were not 
against the people of kuwait but against the regime 
they added we have decided to wear the death shrouds under 
our clothes and that either all our 17 brothers come back to us or 
else we shall meet in our shrouds in the heaven of eternal 
happiness 
the kuwait news agency identified the man killed monday as 
khalid ayyub ismail ayyub bandar a 20yearold worker for kuwaits 
fire brigade on saturday the hijackers killed another man also a 
kuwaiti 
the plane was hijacked april 5 with 112 people aboard on a 
flight from bangkok to kuwait and forced down in iran where 57 
people were freed the jet left iran on friday after refueling 
after lebanon and syria refused to let it land the plane flew

boeing co officials tuesday defended 
their widebody jets against complaints of serious quality control 
problems from at least three airlines 
phil condit executive vice president for boeing commerical 
airplanes said recent publicity about the complaints against its 
747s and 767s stemmed partly from the companys open way of dealing 
with its problems which has made many workers aware of items that 
need improving 
air transportation is the safest transportation mode there 
is and is getting even safer because airlines manufacturers and 
regulatory agencies work together to identify and correct problems 
condit said 
i could not be prouder than i am about the kind of employee we 
have in this country the people are dedicated and proud of 
what they build he told reporters at boeings everett plant 
where the widebodies are made 
one airline complained specifically that the aerospace companys 
workers seemed oblivious that defects could compromise an 
aircrafts safety 
boeings news conference came one day after the federal aviation 
administration confirmed it has issued 50 directives in the last 
two years telling airlines to fix various problems with boeing jets 
the most recent warning was issued friday concerning possible 
fuel leaks in the cargo area of boeings 747200 series of jets 
the leaks can be caused by a bolt giving way in a wing section and 
the faa ordered airlines to inspect them before returning the 
planes to service 
boeing officials said the order applied to 317 operating 
747200s 
airlines boeing and faa officials have said that none of the 
defects cited has been linked to a crash or other major damage 
however fridays directive warned fuel in this compartment 
could result in a fire and substantial damage 
nick wantiez of the seattle faa office said tuesday the 
directive came after reports of incidents by japan air lines 
northwest airlines lufthansa air india aerolineas argentinas and 
a leasing company starting nov 21 with a jal report in los 
angeles of a fuel leak 
condit said the recent publicity presented only a snapshot 
view of boeings continuing efforts to see how its planes can be 
improved 
he also said boeing has become more open with its workers and 
has shared letters of complaint from airline customers with top 
managers and their staffs that openness makes it more likely the 
public will hear about the complaints he said 
wantiez said the agency has expanded its normal monitoring of 
production at boeing to include recent complaints by airlines 
which range from wrong parts to incorrectly installed firefighting 
systems 
we are putting together a plan this week to deal with these 
complaints and to determine what actions must be taken to assure 
compliance with federal regulations wantiez said 
complaints have been sent to boeing by british airways japan 
air lines and all nippon airways a domestic japanese carrier 
gary reich an aerospace industry analyst for shearson lehman 
hutton inc in new york said airlines may be taking an opportunity 
to improve their leverage with boeing the worlds biggest maker of 
commercial aircraft 
i think that what the airlines are doing is holding boeings 
feet to the fire reich said they want an airplane with 
absolutely no defects now

the white house said tuesday that president 
reagan was upset and it was an outrage that former presidential 
spokesman larry speakes had made up quotes and given them to 
reporters as reagans words 
everyone is appalled that he made up quotes said spokesman 
marlin fitzwater who replaced speakes 14 months ago 
in a kissandtell book that has roiled white house officials 
speakes disclosed that he made up a widely reported statement that 
was attributed to reagan during his first summit with soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev in 1985 
in another instance when a korean air lines passenger jet was 
shot down by the soviets in 1983 the president had almost 
nothing to say during meetings with the cabinet and congressional 
leaders speakes said so he said he took statements made by 
secretary of state george p shultz and attributed them to reagan 
speakes said tuesday that he subsequently told the president 
what he had done and reagan never objected 
fitzwater at a news briefing dominated by questions about 
speakes revelation blasted his predecessor who in his six years 
as white house spokesman had boasted that he never lied to the 
press 
its a damned outrage thats what it is fitzwater said 
i resent it so much it casts asperions on the presidency and 
on my position its wrong he shouldnt have done it and 
i wont do it fitzwater said 
he said he had not talked to the president but im sure he 
would be upset about it im sure he is later after conferring 
with the president fitzwater said i stand by my comments 
and another white house official speaking anonymously said 
flatly the president is upset about the book 
james brady the white house spokesman shot during the 1981 
assassination attempt on reagan said the best writer for the 
president is the president himself 
no one talks for president reagan but president reagan said 
brady who still holds the title of white house press secretary and 
goes to the office about once a week we had a halfjoke around 
the office let reagan be reagan 
conservative leaders who met with reagan on tuesday also were 
angry i think larry speakes has done a disservice to the 
president said peter flaherty chairman of citizens for reagan 
paul weyrich head of the free congress foundation said the 
president is illserved by all of these people who are in public 
service and then write books the minute they get out and reveal 
things that ought not to be revealed 
all theyre in it for is making a buck and frankly they 
ought to be ashamed of themselves weyrich said 
speakes had no reaction to the white house statements id be 
better off not to comment he said in a telephone interview from 
new york where he is vice president for communications at merrill 
lynch corp 
however he offered no apologies saying its an honest book 
speakes said the two instances of phony quotes he cited were 
the only two that i specifically recall it was a case of 
knowing the president well and knowing how he felt about the events 
taking place and knowing what he would say 
he said he had told reagan about the quotes 
i generally told him you know what i had done you know and 
the reasons for doing it he never objected to you know these 
cases where i said you know ive gone ahead and done this 
speakes said 
in his book speaking out speakes recalled it was shultz 
who said the shooting down of the korean airliner was not a problem 
between the united states and the soviet union but a soviet vs 
the world problem 
however speakes told reporters the president had said those 
words he also attributed to reagan some of shultzs suggestions 
about retaliatory action 
my decision to put shultzs words in reagans mouth played 
well and neither of them complained speakes wrote 
discussing the summit speakes said he felt that gorbachev was 
really getting the advantage over us in his giveandtake with 
reporters while reagan was very tentative and stilted in his 
comments 
fearing that reagan was losing the media version of star wars 
i instructed mark weinberg a white house press aide to draft some 
quotes for the president speakes wrote 
i polished the quotes and told the press that while the two 
leaders stood together at the end of one session the president 
said to gorbachev there is much that divides us but i believe 
the world breathes easier because we are talking here together 
another reagan quote which we manufactured that received 
extensive play in the press was our differences are serious but 
so is our commitment to improving understanding speakes wrote 
in retrospect it was clearly wrong to take such liberties 
he added certainly reagan would not have disavowed the words 
but the soviets could have said they never heard anything like 
that luckily the russians didnt dispute the quotes and i had 
been able to spruce up the presidents image by taking a bit of 
liberty with my pr mans license 
fitzwater commenting on his policy said i dont make up 
quotes and i dont just write them and run them by the president 
on the other hand the whole business of communication is the 
drafting of material that the president may use in one form or 
another whether its a speech or a statement or quotes on a 
various issue that tell what the president thinks fitzwater said

order i am not concerned about this at all i will simply 
continue

an illegimate child to be his and makes a contract with the babys 
mother who is paid a fee to verify the claim the man then applies 
to a court for the child to be declared his legitimate offspring

newspapers that sell their issues and those that 
distribute free have greater rivals than each other ralph 
ingersoll chairman of ingersoll publications co said tuesday 
ingersolls company is the largest freecirculation publisher in 
the united states but publishes other newspapers with paid 
circulation he bought 10 regional british papers of both kinds in 
january 
in the united states there are still paid daily publishers 
who view free newspapers of any kind as a threatening phenomenon 
but we dont happen to feel that way ourselves he told a 
financial times conference on the newspaper industry 
free circulation and paid dont have to be pitched in mortal 
combat indeed both have more serious natural enemies several of 
which have yet to show their full strength in the uk britain 
he said the real rivals include development of local commercial 
broadcasting direct mail and outdoor advertising ingersoll said 
his company publishes freecirculation newspapers wherever it 
publishes paid papers in the united states 
also he said we publish freecirculation newspapers in 
markets in which other publishers paid or free have defaulted on 
their obligation to deliver dependable readership to local retail 
advertisers 
ingersoll publications is the first foreign company to invest in 
the british regional press where the free versus paid wars 
are relatively new the publisher said 
it acquired the birmingham post birmingham evening mail 
coventry evening telegraph and the regional sunday publication 
sunday mercury all paid newspapers and six free weeklies in the 
midlands region 
the privately held company publishes more than 40 daily papers 
including the trentonian and more than 200 weeklies it has annual 
revenues of 700 million and employs 11000 people 
it is arguable that the traditional paid daily no longer 
exists ingersoll said adding that papers rely on advertising 
and not circulation revenue for their profits 
he said daily newspaper circulation began deteriorating after 
world war ii because populations became more transient sprawling 
suburban markets developed and commerical broadcasting grew 
free papers moved into the gap ingersoll said

movie director bernardo bertolucci who was 
prosecuted in italy for last tango in paris was a national 
hero tuesday after the last emperor swept the academy awards 
it won nine oscars including best picture and best director 
congratulatory messages poured in from president francesco 
cossiga other politicians and figures in the italian movie 
industry hailing the victory as a great day for italy 
bertolucci said in an interview with staterun raitv from 
hollywood that he hoped the prizes would give a boost to italys 
flagging movie industry 
recalling his visit to the set in italy of the last emperor 
cossiga said the awards underlined yet again the great merit of 
italian cinema and its authors 
the film was an international production but five italians 
shared in the awards for art direction cinematography film 
editing and direction 
bertolucci 48 won acclaim for his 1970 film the conformist 
but ran into legal problems in italy two years later because of the 
sexual content of last tango in paris 
obscenity charges were filed against him and the stars marlon 
brando and maria schneider 
they were acquitted eventually but the movie was released for 
showing in italy only last year after an appeals court ruled that 
what once was considered obscene need no longer be classified that 
way 
at one point a judge ordered all copies of the movie destroyed 
but after bertolucci appealed to thenpresident giovanni leone the 
court allowed copies to be kept in the national cinema library 
my film has been spared execution and the verdict commuted to 
a life term in the archives the director said at the time 
the awards monday night brought the number of oscars won by 
italians to 31 two other italian directors federico fellini and 
vittorio de sica each won four oscars but in the foreign film 
category

the new york citybased museum of the american 
indian which has long been searching for a more spacious home 
would move and stay in the same place under a compromise plan 
revealed tuesday 
but as soon as the plan was announced objections were raised by 
the smithsonian institution which has a stake in the negotiations 
under the proposal the bulk of the museum collection would move 
into the custom house in lower manhattan while its current upper 
manhattan site remains open and sen daniel k inouye dhawaii 
pursues a plan for a national museum of the american indian in 
washington the national museum would be part of the smithsonian 
institution and have borrowing privileges from the new york indian 
museum 
instead of one museum we get three sen daniel p 
moynihan dny said in announcing the plan he was flanked by 
inouye who is chairman of the senate select committee on indian 
affairs and reps charles rangel and ted weiss both new york 
democrats 
however smithsonian secretary robert mcc adams later issued a 
statement calling the smithsonians association with the plan 
unwise and unworkable 
in a letter to inouye released late tuesday adams detailed his 
objections which include building a new museum to house borrowed 
objects placing undue financial burdens for the facility on the 
smithsonian and not giving the smithsonian sufficient authority 
over the new museum 
the museum of the american indian long has been starved for 
space visitors and funding the 15000squarefoot building in a 
decaying neighborhood is too small to display more than about 1 
percent of its millionartifact collection at a time so most of 
the objects have languished in a bronx warehouse 
the compromise was aimed at resolving a longstanding dispute 
over where to house the collection amassed by george gustav heye 
and established by his will the trust stipulates that the 
collection remain in new york state spurring new york officials to 
rebuff an offer in 1986 by texas tycoon h ross perot to move the 
museum to dallas 
adams suggested that the smithsonian stand aside at this time 
so that the possibility of making the new york custom house 
available to the heye foundation can be pursued

vice president george bush said tuesday he hoped 
former white house aides john poindexter and oliver north would be 
found innocent of any wrongdoing in the irancontra affair 
as to a possible pardon bush said he would deal with that issue 
only if he is forced to face it if elected president 
bush made the comments in interviews with new york reporters in 
a day in which he pitched the first ball in a baseball game called 
it warming up for the fall and defended his attacks against the 
ghost of jimmy carter 
bush was asked if he would pardon thennational security adviser 
poindexter and thenwhite house aide north if elected 
he called the question too hypothetical but then added i 
hope my own personal hope is theyre found innocent of any 
wrongdoing 
if i had to face that a pardon at some time then id keep 
my own counsel and make my own decision it was the first time 
the vice president had expressed a desire that the two indicted 
former officials be found innocent 
bush defended anew his refusal to disclose the advice he gave 
president reagan on the irancontra matter 
ive taken lots of shots on that but it doesnt bother me 
because i know im doing whats right bush told his interviewers 
on another subject bush told reporters that he did not think he 
was too aristocratic to build wide support 
if so why would i have cleaned them republican rivals up in 
the primaries he asked 
for you to suggest that some aristocratic bias makes it 
impossible for me to reach out just you watch bush declared 
bush campaigning in new york one week before the states 
primary elections threw out the ball for the start of a new york 
mets baseball game 
were warming up for the fall race he joked practicing by 
tossing an apple aboard air force two with rep guy molinari rny 
the vice president continued what aides depicted as a generic 
campaign against democrats in speeches taking aim at the policies 
of former president carter 
thats exactly what wed have if we ended up electing one of 
them bush told reporters at an airport news conference in 
syracuse 
he said he saw little difference among the three democratic 
contenders jesse jackson massachusetts gov michael dukakis and 
sen albert gore jr of tennessee all of whom were also in new 
york for a debate and for primary campaigning 
asked by reporters why we was campaigning against carter who 
left office in 1981 bush said because the policies of the 
democrats will take us right back to the high interest rates and 
the doubledigit inflation of the carter years 
at a later speech at a shopping mall in syracuse bush expanded 
upon the theme saying he had no problem running against the 
ghost of jimmy carter 
do you want americans to go back to those terrible days of 
malaise and darkness he asked 
bush attended a 1000aticket fundraising reception tuesday 
night sponsored by developer donald trump who endorsed the vice 
presidents candidacy hes a great gentleman said trump 
bush told the packed reception at new yorks plaza hotel that 
the democratic contenders want to set the clock back and bust 
the federal government 
bush has already raised the 27 million allowable by federal 
election law for direct campaign spending his current fundraising 
activities are designed to raise money for accounting expenses 
exempt from the limit and for party organizations 
at a fundraising breakfast tuesday in schenectady bush told 
supporters i cant wait to take on whichever one of those 
democrats win the democratic nomination

the williamsburg bridge was built in 1903 for 
bicycles and horsedrawn buggies but it has had to carry a much 
heavier load for most of its 85 years and now one of americas 
busiest commuter spans is falling apart 
the culprits are decades of rust and the daily rumblings of more 
than 100000 cars and 420 subway trains that ferry commuters over 
the east river between the williamsburg section of brooklyn and the 
lower east side of manhattan 
they did at least until tuesday when the city transportation 
department closed the bridge indefinitely to all traffic all but 
four of the williamsburgs eight traffic lanes had already been 
closed this week and service suspended on the two subway lines that 
cross the bridge 
it was decided it would serve the interests of safety to close 
the bridge until a further evaluation is made of the material 
submitted to us said transportation department spokesman victor 
ross after a meeting of city and state engineers and officials 
the city acted after inspectors discovered such extensive 
corrosion that they feared the bridge might collapse a team of 
more than 60 inspectors is being deployed to determine the extent 
of the problem 
were finding that yes there is corrosion yes the bridge 
is worse than what we imagined said chuck carlson deputy 
commissioner of the state department of transportation 
what has happened to the williamsburg is hardly unique the 
federal highway administration keeps track of 271300 bridges and 
of those 36000 have some kind of structural deficiency and 41000 
are considered functionally obsolete 
the government estimates it would cost more than 50 billion to 
bring all the nations bridges up to standard 
this is a real crisis in the infrastructure situation in this 
country that people arent focusing on said william d toohey 
jr a spokesman for the american road and transportation builders 
association its a national crisis and in new york state its a 
lot worse than in other places 
in new york city decay has forced the closing of two lanes of 
traffic on each of two other major bridges across the east river 
the manhattan and the queensboro 
but the williamsburg is certainly one of the worst bridges 
that we have said foster j beach iii regional director of the 
state department of transportation for 80 years the bridge 
really hasnt been maintained 
problems were built into the bridge most suspension bridges at 
the time were built with galvanized steel cables the williamsburg 
builders chose ungalvanized steel to cut costs 
the cables were coated with oil to protect them from corrosion 
but the protection didnt last and just at the time when the 
corrosion was beginning to cause serious damage the city became 
engulfed in the fiscal crisis of the 1970s bridge maintenance and 
inspections went by the wayside 
some steel strands within the cables already have snapped 
the williamsburg has always been the rodney dangerfield of new 
york city bridges it lacks the elegance of the george washington 
bridge the romance of the brooklyn bridge and the impressive span 
of the verrazanonarrows bridge 
stout and practical the williamsburg received a great deal of 
criticism for its lack of aesthetic consideration when it was 
finished according to engineer nils d olsson who wrote about the 
bridge in the municipal engineers journal 
at the time the williamsburg at 1600 feet was the longest 
suspension bridge in the world 
the city now must decide whether to repair the williamsburg or 
replace it just last month engineering firms from around the 
world presented 25 proposals for replacements this summer the 
city is to decide 
the cost of replacing the bridge has been estimated at 200 
million to 600 million the cost of renovating was estimated at 
250 million but that was before the latest damage was found 
in the meantime said samuel schwartz the city transportation 
departments chief engineer there has been yet another unexpected 
development were finding that thousands of people have returned 
to walking across the bridge he said 
ross said he did not know if pedestrians would be barred from 
the bridge

senate democratic leader robert c byrd 
announced tuesday he will not seek reelection to the party post he 
has held for a dozen years touching off a wideopen race to 
succeed him 
the 70yearold west virginian said he will run for a sixth 
senate term and if elected and the chamber remains under 
democratic control assume the chairmanship of the senate 
appropriations committee he also would likely become senate 
president pro tempore the post reserved for the most senior 
majority member 
i believe i have been fair firm and honest and i have done 
my best byrd told his fellow democrats i hope that you agree 
i have led my party from the ambivalence of the carter years 
through the extremes of the reagan administration 
some democratic senators privately have criticized byrds 
leadership style over the years saying he looked bad on television 
and did not project well when trying to present the partys 
position to the nation 
sen j bennett johnson of louisiana challenged byrd for his 
position in 1976 but dropped out when it became clear he did not 
have the votes to win he criticized byrd at that time for 
appearing to be out of step with the times 
there had been rumors that byrd told democratic senators in 1986 
that if reelected to the leadership post he would not seek it 
again those rumors were never confirmed 
byrd told reporters he had absolutely no doubt that he could 
have won again as leader had he chosen to run 
byrd said that as chairman of the appropriations committee 
which provides money for all federal programs he would be able to 
help his state of west virginia which he said has suffered under 
the administrations economic policies 
however west virginia gov arch moore criticized byrds 
decision saying byrd would have more influence as majority leader 
than as appropriations chairman and that the change was unlikely to 
benefit his state 
moving down to the chairmanship of the senate appropriations 
committee is very significant and i would be hardpressed to 
suggest that west virginians will notice any difference as a result 
of the change the republican governor said in a statement 
the majority leader of the senate is that chambers chief 
strategist and controlling party spokesman he sets the agenda 
byrds decision drew immediate announcements from three 
democratic senators george mitchell of maine daniel inouye of 
hawaii and johnston that they will seek the leadership post 
senate democrats will decide the issue in a party tally to be held 
after next novembers election 
several senators said there is no clear frontrunner 
this is senator byrds day said mitchell the emphasis 
ought to be on his contribution 
asked whether he will seek the top job inouye said yes i 
will and added that he believes his prospects are very good 
inouye said he did not believe lingering criticism over his 
performance as chairman of the senate irancontra investigating 
committee last summer would pose an obstacle to his bid some 
democratic senators have complained mostly privately that marine 
lt col oliver l north was permitted to steal the show 
one senator who had been thought a possible candidate sen dale 
bumpers dark said he would not make the race 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said byrd had earned 
a special place in history as the grand master of senate rules 
and procedure 
he is one tough ball carrier for his party dole said 
hes a senators senator 
sen john kerry dmass said that while byrd himself had 
provided solid leadership this institution will find new 
leaders there is a very competent group of people running 
sen john melcher dmont said the announcement was not 
unexpected the likelihood of his running again seemed to fade over 
the past year the democrats will seek a new leader now and go on 
from there 
byrds reign has been marked by his mastery of senate rule and a 
somewhat dry if verbose leadership style insider grumbling about 
his leadership qualities has grown over the years 
sen frank lautenberg dnj said byrd has been a very 
effective leader he added however that what well be looking 
for in the leader is perhaps someone with less knowledge of the 
process but hopefully able to do it differently the time for 
change i think is appropriate 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said i have all the respect 
for senator byrd over the time he has served as majority leader and 
minority leader he made this judgment for the best interests of 
the nation and the senate 
since he first entered the senate in 1958 byrd forged a 
reputation as a courtly master strategist who revered the senate 
and its history and gained power inchbyinch by attending to his 
colleagues smallest wishes 
orphaned at an early age byrd was raised by an aunt and uncle 
in the impoverished coal country of west virginia he graduated 
first in his class in high school but he had to work 12 years at 
such jobs as gas station attendant grocery store clerk and butcher 
before he could afford to attend college 
byrds prowess as a country fiddle player helped his campaign 
for the state legislature in 1946 and since then he has never lost 
an election 
after three house terms byrd won a senate seat rising in party 
ranks by using his posts to do legislative and personal favors 
in 1971 byrd called in those favors and ousted kennedy for the 
no 2 party post of assistant leader he became a loyal aide to 
majority leader mike mansfield and succeeded him in 1976 
with the 1980 loss of the senate to the republicans byrd lost 
his position and became minority leader 
in that role byrd led democratic opposition to a highly popular 
republican president 
but byrd returned in triumph when the democrats swept the 1986 
elections recapturing majority rule in the 100th congress

visiting italian government delegation that the kremlin will remove 
50000 troops from afghanistan during a threemonth period

appeared to be the first time an official source gave any 
indication of the size of the soviet force backing the afghan 
government 
official kabul radio said brig gen aqa shah was assaulted by 
extremist opposition elements a reference to the guerrillas 
in the town of pul mattak he later died of his wounds it said 
without giving a date 
he was buried tuesday along with several victims of a passenger 
plane shot down by guerrillas on sunday said kabul radio 
monitored in islamabad 
defense and interior ministry officials attended the funeral in 
kabul it said other victims of the crash in which 29 people were 
killed were buried in the northern province of faryab the 
sovietmade plane had been on a domestic flight in northern 
afghanistan 
the radio said the guerrillas who downed the plane were guided 
by leaders based in peshawar referring to the sevenparty 
guerrilla group which maintains headquarters in pakistan 
under an accord to be signed thursday in geneva the soviet 
union has agreed to remove all of its soldiers from afghanistan 
within nine months of may 15 the first half of them by aug 15 
the troop figure provided by vorontsov would make the size of 
the soviet force about 100000 soldiers western sources have 
estimated there are 115000 soviet soldiers in afghanistan but the 
soviets never have provided a figure 
the italian source attended the meeting but spoke on condition 
he not be further identified 
vorontsov told the group of eight italian lawmakers that half of 
the soviet force would leave afghanistan within three months and 
he mentioned 50000 soldiers the source said 
vorontsov did not provide any further details 
the italian delegation that met with vorontsov was headed by 
christian democrat flaminio piccoli president of the foreign

in the dry dusty south african outback an 
elderly woman creates an outdoor sculpture garden filled with 
strange and wondrous things camels wise men owls pyramids a 
buddha mermaids peacocks even a mosque made of beer bottles 
she calls it her mecca and it is the catalyst for the 
road to mecca athol fugards astonishing and affecting new play 
which opened tuesday at offbroadways promenade theater 
fugard is the south african playwright best known for such works 
as blood knot and master harold and the boys they 
deal with the pervasiveness of apartheid as well as the necessity 
and inevitability of seeing everything in south africa in terms of 
black and white 
the road to mecca with its three white characters touches 
on an apartheid of a different sort it concerns an adventurous 
artist named miss helen at odds with and cut off from the rigid 
and unyielding afrikaners around her its her eccentric art work 
that severs her from society 
miss helen stands at the center of a battle between marius a 
staid minister and elsa an embittered frustrated english 
teacher marius feels miss helen should move to a retirement home 
while the teacher champions the womans right to remain where she 
is and create her exotic statues 
the fight for control of miss helens life and artistic spirit 
takes a while to develop fugard doesnt rush his story he 
examines each member of this trio with sensitivity and care 
act 1 focuses on the two women their relationship is the most 
interesting aspect of the play the younger woman admires miss 
helens independence her ability to pursue what she wants 
regardless of the consequences the older woman relishes the 
companionship of the young teacher whose enthusiasm she admires 
the minister comes between them in the second act a powerful 
explosion of drama that leads to a heartfelt and hopeful 
conclusion fugards mastery of language is never more evident than 
near the end of act 2 when miss helen explains how she came back to 
life after a loveless marriage ended 
yvonne bryceland who plays miss helen is a revelation the 
south africanborn actress originally was rejected by actors equity 
from performing in the united states because it felt she wasnt an 
actress of international stature her performance confirms how 
wrong the union was 
the actress dressed in a gray gunnysack of a dress commands 
the stage with her ingratiating smile and honeycombed voice at 
first she projects a childlike enthusiasm but the demeanor is 
deceptive gradually the womans crisis of faith is revealed and 
the iron will behind her infectious laugh comes through 
fugard who also directed in a careful deliberate manner 
offers a controlled performance as the rigid clergyman he has a 
difficult task to portray a sympathetic antagonist who is as much 
a victim as he is a villain 
amy irving starts on too strong a note as the volatile teacher 
and then has nowhere to go its an emotional showy role but the 
part demands more shading than the actress gives it 
miss helens mecca is never actually seen on stage but a glimpse 
of its glories is offered in designer john lee beattys 
approximation of the womans living room her home literally 
glitters with the artists handiwork lighted by dennis parichy 
the play ends on a reaffirmation of life a reaffirmation by the 
aging artist that recognizes the darkness while celebrating the 
light with miss bryceland as a most entrancing free spirit the 
road to mecca soars above every other play in new york

the development of high definition tv 
offers us industry a chance to improve the trade imbalance for 
consumer electronics products according to a government report 
released tuesday 
the report by the national telecommunications and information 
administration a commerce department agency estimates the total 
potential us sales of high definition tv equipment at more than 
150 billion by the year 2010 
the message of the report is that there is a huge amount of 
money at stake and the strength of the consumer electronics 
industry as well said alfred c sikes head of ntia in 
releasing the report on the final day of the fourday national 
association of broadcasters annual convention here 
advanced television technology including high definition tv 
was a hot topic at this years convention and most of the dozen or 
so competing systems under development were demonstrated the 
technology produces clearer images with more brilliant colors on a 
wider tv screen 
broadcasters are concerned that a japanese lead in developing a 
high definition technology could put them at a competitive 
disadvantage to cable tv video cassette recorders and satellite 
distribution systems if the japanese system which is not 
compatible with existing us television sets takes hold in the 
united states 
sikes said he anticipates that hdtv will follow the same path as 
color television sets and video cassette recorders though he said 
he could not predict how fast sales of hdtv equipment will grow 
that will turn on general economic conditions prices of 
equipment and the availability of software he said 
the report however says that if hdtv sales grow as fast as 
color receivers and vcrs the new products would find their way 
into about 1 percent of american households by 1997 and grow to 
939 percent in 2008 when total sales of hdtv equipment would 
reach 144 billion 
the potential sales are immense the report said and 
substantial participation by us manufacturers in this 
developing market could help restore balance in the trade and 
federal budget deficits 
the debate over hdtv development in the united states has been 
over deciding on an industry transmission standard sikes said he 
believes a standard can be agreed upon by 1991

amtrak train no 392 left carbondale at 
midafternoon as usual but when it pulled into chicagos union 
station about seven hours later five people were dead after two 
collisions with the locomotive authorities said tuesday 
a young southern illinois couple and two of their children died 
monday when their car turned off a parallel road near effingham and 
crossed the track in front of the train about 90 minutes into its 
run police and amtrak officials said 
about 3 hours later a 20yearold woman was killed when her 
car skirted horizontal crossing gates and struck the train near 
kankakee about 60 miles south of chicago officials said 
you dont forget things like this you get the shakes 
said engineer tb parker who was operating the train when the 
second crash occurred 
none of the trains more than 50 passengers was injured said 
amtrak spokeswoman debbie marciniak 
she said the two train drivers were not responsible for the 
deaths they were powerless to avoid the accidents and no 
disciplinary action is planned she said 
ms marciniak said the federal railroad administration had 
contacted amtrak operations personnel tuesday about the accidents 
bill loftus a spokesman for the agency in washington said he was 
unaware of any investigation but that his agency might have called 
to make sure no federal railroad laws had been violated 
the victims of the first accident were identified as cecil ray 
chandler 26 of la clede his wife brenda 25 their 4yearold 
daughter kerry and 3yearold son carl said state police sgt 
don boldrey 
parker said fireman william white 55 was driving when the run 
began they both saw the chandler car turn off a parallel road and 
head slowly toward the track 
parker said he did not believe the family saw the train at the 
crossing marked with a crossing symbol but no gate or lights 
i could see the female occupant of the car and she never 
looked at us i thought i saw the woman holding a child 
mr white had already applied the brakes parker said he 
started blowing the whistle then we put the brakes in emergency 
but it was too late 
he said the engine had been traveling about 76 mph and came to a 
halt onethird of a mile down the track ms marciniak said she did 
not know what the authorized speed limit was in that area but said 
the train was traveling within it 
there was nothing the guy could have done to stop it ms 
marciniak said of the trains driver she said the car exploded on 
impact 
chandler an unemployed sawmill worker and his wife had three 
other children said ronald pagel owner of pagel funeral home in 
edgewood 
the train was delayed about an hour and then headed north again 
with parker taking the controls about halfway through the 300 mile 
run a routine switch 
the train passed through kankakee after dark at the maximum 79 
mph when the railway men saw a car approach rapidly from the west 
parker said 
the crossing signals were working the gates were down and we 
were blowing the whistle he said 
but the car moved into the left lane as if to bypass the gates 
parker said the vehicle struck the trains front wheels causing 
what he described as a minor jolt that destroyed the compact 
car 
annette hanshew who lived outside bourbonnais died in the 
crash said deputy kankakee county coroner robert gessner 
last year illinois ranked second in the nation with 481 
accidents at rail crossings ms marciniak said behind texas with

a federal judge refused tuesday to overrule a 
ban ordered by the agriculture department last month on the use of 
padded shoes on tennessee walking horses 
us district court judge oliver gasch denied breeders and 
displayers of the highgait show horses a temporary restraining 
order to lay aside agriculture secretary richard e lyngs order 
prohibiting the use of the 4inchthick pads on the horses front 
hooves 
lyng issued the order on march 25 after gasch had ruled four 
days earlier that the departments present regulations allowing use 
of the pads to accent the breeds high gait violated the 1970 horse 
protection act 
the 1970 law was intended to eliminate the practice of 
soring using chemicals or devices to accent a horses gait 
through the infliction of pain to the animal in the tennessee 
walker industry 
whether the 4inch pads sometimes called stacks sore or 
cause pain to a horse has been a legal dispute in gaschs court for 
the past four years through a suit by the american horse protection 
association 
gasch described the pads which effectively elevate the front of 
a horse and thus shift its weight to its rear legs as being 
similar to highheeled shoes that a women might decide to quit 
wearing because they hurt her feet 
the horses however dont seem to have a choice he added 
the tennessee walking horse breeders association and a new 
group called friends of the show horse formed in response to lyngs 
ruling had petitioned gasch for the restraining order 
john harmon an attorney for the latter group argued that lyng 
had overstepped the judges march 25 ruling by immediately 
implementing the ban instead of going through the normal lengthy 
process of rewriting the regulations after first holding hearings 
and seeking comments 
the agriculture department which had defended its present 
regulations and agreed with the breeders that the pads were legal 
has started that process of redrafting them but in the interim it 
is prohibiting the padded shoes 
harmon said lyngs action caused the immediate cancellation of 
11 tennessee walking horse shows and threatens another 24 scheduled 
between now and the end of april around the country 
its like pearl harbor to shelbyville said rep jim cooper 
dtenn whose district includes the town that is site to the 
annual tennessee walking horse national celebration the industrys 
largest show 
cooper estimated that the show held each year just prior to 
labor day pumps about 35 million into the shelbyville areas 
economy 
its the flashy fastgaited horses that draw the crowds he 
said people in the business tell me the horses without pads are 
not as exciting 
however sharon rice who owns a small stable of tennessee 
walkers in fairfax va said she is now showing five horses that 
have never had pads put on their hooves 
they dont need to use them she said of the devices it 
just makes it easier and quicker to train them and for people 
running large farms that means they can just run that many more 
horses through

former white house spokesman larry speakes 
says he attributed remarks on major foreign policy issues to

speakes says that after a korean air lines plane carrying 61 
americans was shot down in 1983 he credited statements made by

businessmen holmes tuttle and earle jorgensen 
are among the 20 or so wealthy friends of president reagan who 
chipped in at least 156000 apiece to buy a california estate for 
the reagans to occupy when they leave the white house according to 
documents released tuesday 
the documents include a 1986 opinion from the office of 
government ethics which concludes that even if the group of 
businessmen decided to give the 25 million los angeles estate to 
the reagans free of charge the president probably would not be 
violating any federal ethics regulations by accepting it 
the informal opinion letter notes that criminal 
conflictofinterest laws dont apply to the president nor do the 
standards of conduct for the executive branch of government set out

edgar and arthur simionescu lived the 
simplest of lives in the most complex of times quiet men in a 
quiet town measuring their wealth in their devotion to each other 
few people noted the passing of edgar and arthur two years ago 
three months apart in the brown shingled house where they spent 90 
years they outlived almost everyone who ever knew them 
they might have faded away completely side by side in 
hackensack cemetery the fragments of their lives preserved only in 
bits of paper in the bergen county courthouse but for the matter 
of their will hackensack high school and a pile of money 
that bit of paper turned the simple story of edgar and arthur 
into hackensack legend 
the sons of a romanian head waiter at a wall street restaurant 
arrived in hackensack in 1896 the family moved to a large frame 
house on sussex street not far from the site of the first 
hackensack high school built a year later for 12000 
edgar the eldest attended the school for a year in 1904 by 
the time his brother arthur entered in 1909 the brick building 
was already bursting with students and plans were in the works for 
a new high school 
arthur left two years later and max the family baby was the 
only simionescu to attend the new school completed in 1918 and the 
only brother to graduate 
max became an accountant and married kathleen ryan a girl he 
met while working summers at an uncles ice cream stand at the 
connecticut shore 
arthur was stricken with polio at age 17 and the paralysis left 
him wheelchairbound for the rest of his life 
edgar became a machinist and was drafted into the armys horse 
cavalry in world war i he had served only a couple of months when 
the war ended and he never again ventured far from the house on 
sussex street or from arthurs side 
for years edgar had arthur and arthur had his stamp collection 
and they both had max who always called them the boys even 
though he was at least 10 years younger and even after they were 
all over 70 
in the summer max and kathleen invited the boys to their home 
for picnics edgar was the cutup the extrovert always looking 
for attention arthur was more serious more thoughtful 
they were very close whatever arthur said edgar went 
along said matthew oconnor assistant vice president in the 
trust department at united jersey bank who came to love the 
brothers like uncles i never heard one raise their voice to the 
other 
they lived contentedly undisturbed every day edgar helped his 
brother dress eased him in and out of his wheelchair and assisted 
with his stamp orders edgar cooked their meals as long as he was 
able and maintained the house even into his 80s he was fixing 
things painting or repairing this or that he didnt believe in 
bringing in outsiders 
for years they had a weekly poker game with another pair of 
brothers plumbers dealers choice nickel stakes 
they never watched television all the news worth learning was 
in the newspaper edgar believed and he would sit in his mothers 
chair and read it aloud to arthur who couldnt turn the pages or 
hed lay the paper in front of arthur and turn the pages for him 
the city shifted and grew around them public housing projects 
sprang up on the site of the hackensack high school they had 
attended and businesses and warehouses cropped up around their 
home their sisterinlaw begged them to move but they refused 
the more hackensack changed the more edgar and arthur stayed the 
same 
they were happy the way they lived oconnor said to our 
standards they probably lived frugal lives to them they did not 
they had enough to eat clothing a roof over their heads they 
paid their bills 
money meant little to the boys dignity was everything arthurs 
last wish was that edgar whose health and mind were deteriorating 
never be placed in a nursing home the night arthur died at 90 
the men from the funeral home almost took away the sleeping edgar 
not yet oconnor told them 
on their doctors advice edgar was never told of arthurs 
death but those around him were sure he sensed it he died three 
months later at 93 
they had some investments stocks and bonds purchased years ago 
most of the certificates were so old they were handwritten and 
some of the companies no longer existed having long since been 
swallowed up by others 
they never changed securities that was their philosophy but 
the value of their investments changed radically in the last 10 
years 
by the time edgar and arthur died their estate was worth more 
than 15 million 
the money was left in trust for hackensack high school with 
direction that the 120000 or so in annual interest be given in 
college scholarships to its students based on need administrators 
hope to award the first batch this spring 
if you or i had a million and a half 2 million bucks would 
you not consider moving into some kind of condo where you had the 
elevators where you had all the services where you could have the 
sunshine wondered harold bloom principal at hackensack high 
these men were not frightened men why did they stay they must 
have loved their community or their home 
what they loved most perhaps was growing old in a place where 
they didnt have to open the door when change came knocking a 
place where two bachelor brothers could turn quiet lives into an 
eloquent gift of hope for other peoples children 
were the family of the simionescus bloom said in 
perpetuity for generations thats a nice memorial isnt it

the lighting is soft the food and wine 
exquisite the conversation witty and sophisticated ingredients 
for a perfect evening 
but the men and women at the elegant restaurant are more 
interested in salmon mousse than sizzling amour dalliance though 
welcome is not the goal of the single gourmet a less romantic 
but frequently more satisfying pleasure lies behind the 
organization with about 10000 members in north america 
its probably the best way to meet people said art fischer 
who began the club in new york in 1982 its not a dating agency 
its not a matrimonial agency its a dining club we try to bring 
people together for good food and congenial conversation 
the organizations recipe stirred by changes in courtship and 
fascination with the arts of the kitchen has been successful the 
new york branch has grown to 2600 members and 14 independent 
chapters have opened in the united states and canada fischer said 
in a telephone interview 
members pay up to 75 a year to join the single gourmet and 
2550 not including wine for meals at restaurants or on other 
outings most are uppermiddleclass professionals lawyers 
business executives stockbrokers and doctors fischer said 
in keeping with the classy lowkey approach members are not 
afflicted with name tags but are identified discreetly at tables 
of six to 10 with placecards bearing only first names 
in san francisco about 35 members of the single gourmet 
recently enjoyed salmon tortellini pear and parsnip soup lamb 
with couscous and other specialities of california cuisine at cafe 
majestic a popular restaurant in a restored victorian hotel 
ive wanted to come to this restaurant ever since it opened 
but i never dared come by myself said jenny 49 a medical 
secretary so this is a real option for me 
the chapter about 18 months old has about 270 members in the 
bay area one member travels from nevada to attend its dinners 
winery tours and other functions which occur about twice a month 
some regulars simply find the single gourmet a way to fit a 
social life into their busy schedules 
it forces you to go out for instance i would not on a 
tuesday night go out to cafe majestic or someplace like it said 
louis sclafani a designer in his 30s 
it gives you a nice experience trying different restaurants 
and lets you experiment without as a single man having to go out 
on a date he said 
others like gary sternitzke first used the club as a way to 
learn about good restaurants and find friends in a new city he was 
hooked when he ended up belly dancing at a moroccan restaurant at 
the first single gourmet dinner he attended a year and a half ago 
sternitzke 35 credits the club for introducing him a native 
of the midwest raised on meatandpotatoes stuff to culinary 
adventure 
ive tasted food i cant even say he said and ive tried 
food when ive asked them not to tell me what it is until ive 
eaten it 
but all the diners agreed they hadnt joined the single gourmet 
as a singles club or dating service 
i just enjoy meeting people if it was single and married 
people id probably join then too said jeanne swift who began 
attending dinners six months ago 
jenny who declined to give her last name said sex wasnt a 
factor in the civilized pleasure of enjoying food with others 
when youre eating lovely food you want to look across the 
table and say this is wonderful you must have a taste she 
said i dont care if its with men or women 
but changing sexual behavior has definitely helped the single 
gourmet members and coordinators said 
it just seemed like an idea that came at the right time 
fischer said it was the time the novel and movie looking for 
mr goodbar was giving singles bars and discos a bad name you 
almost had to make up your mind about someone on eye contact 
thats hardly the way to get to know somebody 
but while people may not be looking for love when they join 
sometimes they find it anyway the new york chapter has seen 28 
marriages of club members in six years fischer said 
fischer a retired film importer owns the single gourmet name 
and sells licenses for branches which operate independently 
although members may attend dinners and other single gourmet events 
in other cities

us bishops making obligatory treks to rome are 
finding that pope john paul ii is happier with their church than 
some had supposed 
nevertheless their representatives have been summoned for a 
special meeting next year with him about the whole situation 
indications had arisen in several recent diciplinary cases of 
strains between the vatican and this countrys catholicism 
including john pauls rebuke to dissent on his visit last year 
but as the bishops began their onceeveryfive years ad 
limina visits the pope was said to seem highly upbeat about the 
state of the american church 
he seems to have a very strong postitive estimate of the 
church in the united states since his trip says archbishop john 
may of st louis president of the national conference of catholic 
bishops 
i got the impression he was a little irked by people who had 
filled him with all kinds of warnings and apprehensions may said 
he said the bishops welcome a special meeting with the pope next 
year an unusual summit session john paul announced last month to 
21 midwestern bishops at the close of their groups visit 
they were the first a series of such callers to continue through 
october in which all the us bishops in rotation visit the pope 
in interviews with the initial returning group from kansas 
missouri iowa and nebraska the national catholic reporter said 
they were elated by the open and warm atmosphere of the 
meetings 
several said they were apprehensive going in but left with a 
far greater sense that the pontiff supports the thrust and 
direction of us catholicism the paper summarized 
they said the pope left them with the distinct impression he 
thought he had been illserved by some in rome who had painted a 
dire image of catholic life in the united states 
to the contrary john paul said he found an energetic and 
faithful church committed to serving the needs of the poor 
his announcement of the 1989 meeting came as no surprise as it 
had been suggested by us bishops last spring 
at the time various concerns about relations with the vatican 
had been brewing including its ouster of a washington dc 
theologian the rev charles curran and restrictions later 
lifted on seattle archbishop raymond hunthausen 
those issues have quieted however and may said the summit 
meeting was not focused on any crisis in the church as have been 
some such sessions with bishops in brazil and holland 
he said the pope never mentioned the rift that has developed 
among us bishops over a statement issued in december by their 
50member administrative board on aids but that it was discussed 
with vatican doctrinal officials 
they expressed concern about the apparent disagreement among 
bishops about the document he said the document emphasized 
premarital chastity and fidelity in marriage but some bishops 
objected to its tolerating information about condoms in public 
education about aids 
meanwhile with the number of active us cardinals down to 
three speculation rose that the pope may soon appoint new ones in 
this country and elsewhere worldwide there are only 98 cadinals 
younger than 80 the maximum age for eligibility to vote for a 
pope while the minimum number set for that task is 120 
among the leading prospects for red hats in this country are 
archbishops james hickey of washington dc roger mahoney of los 
angeles edmund szoka of detroit and may 
however retired cardinals still are living in detroit st 
louis and los angeles and the usual custom is not to name another 
in their sees in their lifetimes 
philadelphia also has a retired cardinal john krol but he 
stepped down only last year and his replacement archbishop 
anthony j bevilacqua is likely considered too new on the job for 
elevation now 
other possibilities are minneapolis archbishop john r roach and 
baltimore archbishop william d borders although their progressive 
leanings may be against them and archbishop patrick flores of san 
antonio

the luck child borrows elements from the lucky child and 
marco the rich and vasily the luckless in a collection by 
alexander afanasev a russian ethnographer and lawyer he published 
more than 600 native folk tales in the mid1800s becoming the 
russian counterpart to the brothers grimm of germany 
the luck child also contains elements of grimms the 
griffin and the devil with three golden hairs a peasant 
child is born and according to a prophecy he will one day rule 
the land whose current leader tries to do away with him but the 
luck child survives after tricking the griffin 
the sponsors hope viewers will look for more stories like the 
luck child in books one of the shows sponsors clorox also is 
a sponsor of the national nonprofit literacy organization 
reading is fundamental which has distributed 78 million books to 
children since 1966 its a rare event a primetime network 
sponsor hoping youll read more books 
one such book could be folk tales of the amur abrams 
which includes 31 stories from the russian far east another is 
afanasevs collection russian fairy tales random house 
the afanasev book is a standard according to alex alexander 
head of the slavic department at hunter college in new york and an 
expert on russian folklore it includes russian versions of 
universal fairytale figures as well as the firebird the witch 
baba yaga and ivan the terrible 
ironically russian tales like these apparently first appeared 
in written form not in their homeland in their native tongue but 
in england in the 1600s after being brought out and translated by 
foreign travelers this was mainly because russian written 
literature was almost entirely based on church teachings and folk 
tales were passed by word of mouth 
the tradition of borrowing and retelling to suit different 
nations and storytellers continued when authors such as gogol 
dostoevski and tolstoy incorporated folklore into their works 
for example although pushkin knew russian folk tales and 
recorded them he wrote story poems based for the most part on 
french translations of the arabian nights grimm or washington 
irving pushkins tale of the golden cockerel is simply a 
retelling of irvings legend of the arabian astrologer yet 
russian and american readers think its russian folklore

israel turns 40 this week beset by a rebellion 
among palestinians who have spent more than half that time under 
occupation and a wrenching debate on the young nations future 
the arab uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip has 
drained much of the joy from a yearlong birthday celebration that 
climaxes april 22 which coincides on the the hebrew calendar this 
year with may 14 1948 the date israel was founded 
a poetry festival and a 10 million rock music extravaganza in 
the negev desert are going ahead but plans to bring singer barbra 
streisand tennis star chris evert and the rock group pink floyd 
collapsed 
officials had hoped to demonstrate israels achievements and 
acceptance during the anniversary year instead canceled plans and 
the absence of foreign heads of state underline its vulnerability 
much of israels success has been in developing military power 
the result of five wars with neighboring arab states for example 
it ranks sixth in the world in arms exports which bring in about 
1 billion a year 
there also is a flourishing cultural life especially in a range 
of music from hebrew punkrock to that great national cultural 
achievement the israeli philharmonic 
since dec 8 when the violence began israel has been consumed 
by the question of what to do with the territories captured from 
jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war for the first time 
the issue is likely to be the focus of elections now scheduled for 
november 
liberal politicians say 20 years of occupation has had a 
corrosive effect on morality and does not square with being a 
light unto nations the goal declared by israels first prime 
minister the late david bengurion 
abba eban elder statesman of the labor party said growth of 
character has not matched the countrys growth in material wealth 
and military power 
we anticipated that within a period of 40 years we would have 
outlived the rhetoric of struggle and resistance and would be 
moving into some kind of drama and romance in social creativity 
the former foreign minister said 
modern israel does not owe the same allegiance debt or 
devotion to its traditional jewish character and it very rarely 
compares its actions to criteria that come from the jewish ethical 
tradition 
he said democracy was being undermined by the emergency measures 
of occupation and the cooperative spirit of pioneer days was being 
supplanted by materialism 
such misgivings are not shared by the rising star of the 
conservative likud bloc benyamin netanyahu who recently resigned 
as ambassador to the united nations he said israels success 
borders on the miraculous 
half a century ago netanyahu said the jewish people had 
crawled from the holocaust and the possibility of building a 
national life seemed hopelessly remote 
yet in a few years the jews recovered their homeland fought 
off armies that assaulted them liberated their ancient capital 
built a modern economy theaters universities and concert halls 
and revived an ancient tongue he declared 
netanyahu whose brother yonathan was killed leading the daring 
1976 rescue of hijacked airline hostages at entebbe uganda said 
the arab threat is undiminished 
the grim truth remains that the majority of the arab world 
still refuses to accept israels right to exist and still seeks to 
wage war against it war by different means including the present 
means of mass violence and media stampede netanyahu said 
in the former ambassadors view withdrawal from the occupied 
lands would shrink israels waist to a 10milewide strip against 
the sea with thousands of young palestinians holding rockets 
instead of stones 
the left believes israel is strong and secure enough to risk 
trading land for peace and that greater danger lies in keeping the 
occupied territories and trying to rule the hostile and rapidly 
growing popuatlion of 15 million arabs 
palestinian intellectuals attribute the sudden explosion of 
anger and violence dec 8 to three factors 
the palestinian question was ignored by the ussoviet summit 
last december and given secondary priority to the iraniraq war at 
the arab summit in november 
prime minister yitzhak shamir expressed satisfaction with the 
status quo and a desire to make the occupied land a permanent part 
of greater israel 
daily frustrations about army rule radicalized younger arabs 
a generation of palestinians has been born and grown to 
adulthood since 1967 resentful of occupation and less intimidated 
by the might of the israeli military many also have been attracted 
to the moslem fundamentalism spreading through the arab world 
one result of these forces has been a young underground 
leadership of the palestine liberation organization that has taken 
charge of the rebellion and is directing it 
saeb erakat a political science professor at an najah 
university in the west bank said the uprising is a message to 
the israelis the americans and the arabs we dont want to become 
israeli we are not a minority but a people and therefore we 
demand our right to selfdetermination 
many israelis say the arabs fail to comprehend or accept the 
historical connection jews feel to the land 
yehuda avni immigrated from chicago in 1949 and built the vered 
hagalil ranch near the sea of galilee with his wife yona across 
the road from his stable of purebred arabian horses is the ruin of 
the home of an israelite who lived about 200 bc 
we both picked this site with its beautiful view for our 
farms said avni 60 i feel a kind of kinship with him i feel 
i am part of a chain the sense of continuity is something vivid 
and it gives depth to my life 
in efrat a jewish settlement eight miles south of jerusalem 
rabbi shlomo riskin showed a reporter the rocky hills on which he 
has founded a community of 300 mostly religious jews 
seeking to dispel the image of settler as fanatic riskin 
stresses his desire for coexistence with arabs 
the difficulty of achieving it is illustrated by his experience 
with majid a palestinian handyman who taught riskin arabic 
i studied with him a few times a week the rabbi said he 
had gefilte fish at my home on friday evening a number of times we 
had what i thought were very good relations 
then one day a bomb was planted just outside efrat and one of 
the prime suspects was majid who disappeared 
i teach my children and myself to respect every human being as 
innocent until proven guilty riskin said at the same time i 
have to make sure that i protect myself 
the arabisraeli conflict touches almost every aspect of life 
even the 110piece israel philharmonic 
ely eban 38 a clarinetist and son of abba eban said the 
unseen impact was brought home to him when he returned from 
studying in the united states in israel the tempo of life was 
rapid 
whenever i would hear myself playing something here it always 
seemed a little fast a little strident a little more nervous 
he said when you live here there is this rhythm that you take 
on and it does affect the music making

palestinians say a feeling they have been 
neglected by the world and other arabs tough statements from 
israel and daybyday frustrations of occupation led to the 
rebellion in the west bank and gaza strip 
the spark was a traffic accident dec 8 in which an israeli army 
truck killed four arabs near the jabaliya refugee camp in the gaza 
strip 
tensions were such that arabs saw it not as an accident but as 
revenge for the stabbing death in gaza city two days earlier of 
shlomo sakel an israeli businessman 
anger had been building among palestinians because they felt 
abandoned by arab nations and the world community the arab summit 
at amman jordan in november and the ussoviet summit in 
washington in december did not give priority to the palestinian 
issue 
it was clear to us that we had been put on the shelf said 
saeb erakat a political science professor at an najah university 
in the west bank 
the message of the uprising is that we dont wish to become 
israelis we are not a mere community or a minority living in 
greater israel we are a people and we demand our liberty and 
our right to selfdetermination 
prime minister yitzhak shamir rubbed salt in the wound by noting 
publicly that the arab summit put the iraniraq war ahead of the 
palestinian issue 
he and other rightwing leaders suggested the status quo could 
continue indefinitely and israel had a right to keep the lands it 
captured in the 1967 middle east war 
this deepened the bitterness palestinian statements became 
extreme in rejecting negotiations for a peaceful settlement 
an example of the harder line could be found in the poetry of 
mahmoud darwish an israeli arab living in paris who had favored 
israelipalestinian dialogue 
many saw his poem those who pass between fleeting words as a 
demand for all of israel not just the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip 
about the israelis it says 
o those who pass between fleeting words 
carry your names and be gone 
rid our time of your hours and be gone 
steal what you will from the blueness of the sea and the sand 
of memory 
sari nusseibeh a palestinian intellectual who advocates a 
negotiated settlement said many want all israel included in a 
palestinian state just as some israelis want all the land for the 
jewish state 
the question is whether both sides are ready to settle for 
less than what they want he said are they prepared to settle 
for some kind of partition of this land 
he said most palestinians are ready for a twostate solution 
but this feeling is like a comet that comes close to the earth 
if one wants to use it one has to grab it while it is there 
he also cited the cumulative affects of 20 years of occupation 
on the new generation noting that half the people of the west bank 
and gaza strip are under 20 years old and 77 percent under 28 
for them he said leadership status is determined by how many 
times you have been in jail how bad was the interrogation and has 
anybody in your family died fighting 
the more yeses to such questions the more of a leader you 
became within your neighborhood or community he added 
as palestinian militancy grew the deterrent power of israels 
army was weakened 
palestinians saw shiite moslem guerrillas drive the israelis out 
of south lebanon in 1985 with a determined guerrilla campaign 
then in late november 1987 a palestinian guerrilla sailed over 
israels welldefended northern border with a hang glider and 
killed six soldiers israeli analysts said the attack encouraged 
palestinians to challenge the army in the occupied territories

consumer operations manufacturers hanover said it would remain a 
strong player in the consumer market through its branch banking 
division a new york area regional bank and its nationwide credit 
card operation 
manufacturers hanovers decision to sell its consumer finance 
unit which is based in huntingdon valley pa came as no surprise 
as it tries to recover from heavy losses absorbed last year when it 
boosted its loan loss reserve 
the bank holding company posted a 114 billion loss in 1987 as 
it boosted its loanloss reserve by 17 billion in anticipation of 
problems with some of its third world loans 
manufacturers hanover expected a pretax gain of about 300 
million from the proposed sale 
we are realizing a substantial premium over book value on this 
wellmanaged company said john f mcgillicuddy chairman and 
chief executive of manufacturers hanover 
manufacturers hanovers common stock rose 12 cents to 26 a 
share and american general was off 50 cents a share to 3250 on 
the new york stock exchange 
american general would make the acquisition through its 
credithrift financial corp based in evansville ind 
the purchase would boost credithrifts assets to more than 6 
billion from 33 billion and give it a total of 1400 branch 
offices in 42 states puerto rico and the virgin islands 
both credithrift and manufacturers hanover consumer services 
market consumer and home equity loans and retail financing 
services and have insurance subsidiaries that provide 
creditrelated coverage 
lawrence cohn who follows the banking business for merrill 
lynch amp co said manufacturers hanover appeared to have gotten a 
good price for the unit and that the sale should not hurt its 
overall profitability 
manufacturers hanover said the consumer finance unit earned 
552 million in 1987 cohn said the company should be able to earn 
that much in interest on proceeds from the sale 
cohn also said the sale will help manufacturers hanover toward 
its goal of boosting the ratio between shareholders equity and its 
assets a key indicator monitored by federal regulators 
manufacturers hanover had told shareholders earlier this year 
that it intended to boost that ratio to 4 percent by the end of 
1988 through a combination of stronger operating earnings 400 
million in pretax gains on the sale of undervalued assets and use 
of tax benefits 
manufacturers hanover said the consumer finance sale would add 
about 275 million to shareholders equity and reduce total assets 
by about 3 billion from 733 billion at the end of 1987 
cohn figured the sale would boost the equitytoassets ratio to 
about 332 percent from 281 percent at the end of 1987 
american general posted a profit of 555 million in 1987 and had 
28 billion in assets its credithrift subsidiary earned 689 
million in 1987 
harold s hook chairman and chief executive of american 
general said the purchase should not dilute american generals 
earnings and there were no plans to alter the companys previously 
announced stock repurchase plan 
american general said it would change the name of its consumer 
credit segment to american general financial services upon 
completion of the deal 
in addition to purchase price manufacturers hanover said it 
also would receive a cash dividend of 20 million representing the 
consumer finance units earnings between jan 1 and the closing of 
the transaction

jp stevens amp co remains the hub of a frenzied 
bidding contest with rival suitors odyssey partners and west 
pointpepperell inc each sweetening their buyout offers a third 
time for the textile giant 
odyssey ended the latest round in the lengthy auction late 
monday by raising to 122 billion or 6850 a share the price it 
is willing to pay under its march 29 agreement to acquire stevens 
the sweetened offer by the investment firm came hours after 
pepperell had raised its cash tender offer for new yorkbased 
stevens to 119 billion or 67 a share for each of stevens 178 
million common shares outstanding 
in trading on the new york stock exchange stevens stock rose 50 
cents a share to close at 6650 indicating speculators were 
unsure that the heated bidding would move much higher 
odysseys latest bid which topped its previous 64ashare 
offer worth about 114 billion will expire at midnight edt april 
22 unless extended 
in addition to sweetening its rival bid pepperell said it 
removed major antitrust concerns about its proposal by agreeing 
with the federal trade commission to sell certain stevens assets if 
its offer succeeds 
analysts had predicted further bidding in the battle for 
stevens a leading maker of home textiles such as sheets and 
towels but they said the bidding was reaching the upper limits of 
a reasonable price for the 175yearold company 
based on my expectations for stevens cash flow this year and 
assuming some overheadand capital spending could be cut some it 
supports a bid of 65 a share and not significantly above that 
said deborah bronston an analyst at prudentialbache securities co 
joseph l lanier jr pepperells chairman and chief executive 
officer said in an interview that he considered 119 billion a 
fair price but he said the company would have to consider our 
options if odyssey increased its bid 
pepperell had no comment late monday on whether it would 
initiate yet another round of bidding the companys offer which 
is not conditioned on financing expires at midnight edt april 22 
odyssey had charged that a pepperellstevens merger would 
violate antitrust laws but pepperell said it reached agreement 
with the ftc on friday over divestitures to ease those concerns 
the ftc would permit pepperells previously announced plans to 
sell half of stevens bath lines and 20 percent of its sheet lines 
for about 170 million to ntc group parent of the textile 
manufacturer bibb co pepperell said 
the ftc also waived waiting requirements under federal 
disclosure laws but might require pepperell to sell a sheeting 
mill a yarn plant certain designer licenses and a brand name if 
the deal was consummated pepperell stated 
the ftc has six months to decide whether pepperell must divest 
those stevens assets 
prudentialbaches bronston said the sheeting mill generates 
annual sales of between 30 million to 40 million while the yarn 
plant is relatively small 
among the designer licenses the ftc has identified as potential 
problems are ralph lauren gloria vanderbilt eileen west and perry 
ellis bronston said 
pepperells lanier said that while he would prefer not to sell 
those assets it would have no significant impact if we had to 
bronston said that given its situation pepperell might be 
forced to sell the licenses at prices lower than what the company 
paid for them 
stevens also has licenses for the designers laura ashley pierre 
cardin and givenchy among others pepperells brands include 
arrow martex lady pepperell and burberry 
bidding for stevens began after it received a leveraged buyout 
offer earlier this year from a group led by its own senior 
management including chairman whitney stevens a fifthgeneration 
member of the family that founded the company in 1813 
pepperell which is based in west point ga launched a 
6250ashare tender offer last month after stevens agreed to a 
buyout by odyssey at 6150 a share 
odyssey subsequently sweetened its offer to 64 and announced 
last week that it had commitments in place to finance the 114 
billion bid 
under terms of its agreement with odyssey stevens board said it 
would pay the firm up to 8 million if the textile company was 
acquired by a third party for more than 64 a share

a lawsuit seeking to force citibank to 
obey iowa consumer credit laws potentially could affect other 
companies that like citibank offer credit cards in iowa but base 
their card operations elsewhere the states attorney general says 
attorney general tom miller filed a federal lawsuit monday 
seeking to sto citibank the nations biggest credit card issuer 
from applying the less stringent credit laws of south dakota where 
its credit card operation is based to other states 
the suit contended that although the courts consistently have 
allowed credit card issuers to use the laws of their home state in 
setting interest rates wherever they operate that power should not 
apply to other consumer credit issues 
we are challenging the assumption that they can export the 
laws of states which have few consumer protections into states like 
iowa that have stronger protections for their citizens miller 
said at a news conference announcing the suit 
the suit could affect every bank that has a national credit 
card operation he said 
miller said other states had indicated interest in joining the 
action 
citibanks sioux falls sd office referred reporters calls to 
its new york headquarters spokesman bill mcquire in new york said 
that while the company had not seen the suit it did comply with 
federal law 
citibank is the banking subsidiary of the new yorkbased 
citicorp the nations largest bank holding company it is accused 
of collecting late charges and other fees that are allowed under 
south dakota law but are banned in iowa 
the company has issued about 15 million credit cards nationwide 
but insists that south dakotas consumer laws govern its cards 
wherever they are issued there are 36000 citibank mastercard and 
visa cards issued in iowa 
miller said although iowa has deregulated credit card interest 
rates it also has banned late payment fees and insufficient funds 
check charges iowa also requires companies give three months 
notice before changing the terms of a credit card contract 
the banks argue that iowa law doesnt apply in this 
situation miller said we say our state law does protect 
iowans 
miller also said the south dakota law gave citibank a 
competitive advantage over iowabased issuers who had to follow 
their states stricter credit rules 
millers suit seeks a ban on collection of the late payment 
fees plus unspecified civil penalties and a refund of any payments 
which have been collected 
the state targeted citibank for the suit because it is the 
biggest card issuer although other companies may be sued as well 
miller said the state failed to reach an outofcourt settlement 
over the issue with citibank he said 
the nations top 10 credit card companies have about 64 million 
cards outstanding representing accounts of more than 32 billion

secret contract talks between eastern airlines and 
its pilots union to reach a labor agreement before a possible 
machinists strike have broken off according to company and union 
officials 
the talks which were kept secret by a gentlemans agreement 
of confidentiality lasted a couple of months said union 
spokesman ron cole 
they ended april 1 according to an april 8 letter from the 
airline that warned pilots a settlement with the company is the 
least preferred alternative of union leaders 
facing a possible machinists strike eastern has been seeking 
to guarantee pilot stability and cooperation 
it made sense to reach an agreement now than start all 
over again with the pilots after the machinists negotiations the 
time was right to reach an agreement because the company needed the 
pilots said the letter to pilots from tom matthews easterns 
senior vice president for human resources and don breeding vice 
president for flight operations 
the pilots contract officially becomes open for amendment july 
1 and the latest talks were not official negotiations cole said 
eastern has been negotiating a new contract with the machinists 
the largest of the three unions at the financially troubled 
carrier since last fall

nissan motor co japans no 2 automaker will 
reduce car exports to the united states to ease pressure from 
mounting inventories nissan officials said tuesday 
they wouldnt specify the scale of the planned reduction but 
japanese press reports which nissan officials called speculative 
said the company will cut shipments of passenger cars by about 30 
percent to 200000 in the aprilseptember period from 283000 a 
year earlier 
nissan dealers in the united states are flooded with unsold 
cars an autoindustry analyst in tokyo said 
according to us industry estimates nissan had about 155 days 
worth of inventories in the us at the beginning of march well 
above the 70day average for japanese carmakers as a whole 
nissan attributes its sales slump in the united states to 
complete model changes planned later this year for some of its 
popular cars such as 200sx coupes and maxima sedans consumers 
tend to refrain from buying cars that are slated for restyling and 
other major changes nissan officials explained 
industry watchers said nissans newly styled models in the 
domestic market are proving popular among consumers however 
because of the scale of the company which sells about 27 million 
units of motor vehicles worldwide annually it takes about four 
years to carry out a full companywide model changeover 
nissan began restraining usbound car shipments late last year 
as a result of a sales slowdown following price hikes forced under 
the yens prolonged strength 
mainly because of nissans slower exports japans car shipments 
to the united states in the year ended march 31 fell short of the 
23 millionunit limit for the first time since the restraints were 
imposed by the japanese government in 1980 
according to unofficial industry figures japanese car exports 
to the us fell about 86000 units short of the limit last year 
japan decided it would continue the ceiling at 23 million units 
a year for the new year beginning april 1

a change in the structure of japans economy 
contributed to the first decline in japans fiscalyear trade 
surplus in eight years government and private analysts said 
tuesday 
the finance ministry announced monday that japans overall trade 
surplus dropped 153 percent in the fiscal year ended march 31 to 
76 billion from 897 billion in the previous fiscal year 
it was the first decline since 1979 when japans oil import 
bill soared because of the second oil crisis 
japans trade surplus with the united states posted its first 
annual decline since 1982 dropping 22 percent to 509 billion 
from a record 52 billion the year before 
a shift toward the direction of a decline in trade surplus is 
taking place at a steady pace said nobuo murakami deputy 
director of the finance ministrys export division 
the yens rapid appreciation against the dollar the past two 
years and the government policy to promote domestic demand were 
major factors in the decline in the surplus murakami said 
the yen has roughly doubled in value against the dollar since 
its most recent low in february 1985 in september 1985 monetary 
authorities from seven major industrialized countries agreed to 
drive down the dollars value to help reduce the huge us trade 
deficit 
a higher yen makes japanese exports more expensive abroad and 
less competitive while imported products are cheaper in japan 
japan sent 358 percent of its exports to the united states in 
fiscal year 1987 down from 38 percent the previous year its 
exports to the european economic community increased to 167 
percent from 154 percent and to southeast asian countries to 237 
percent from 206 percent 
it is clear that some major japanese products including 
automobiles are losing their competiveness on the us market 
though personal computers and other office equipment remain in high 
demand said taku hiramatsu assistant manager of the research 
department of bank of tokyo 
hiramatsu said japans auto exports to the united states which 
accounted for about 30 percent of the nations total exports to the 
united states will be getting further squeezed in the future 
because several japanese automakers will be making car in the 
united states in 1990s 
japanese automakers have fallen short of the governmentset 
export quota of 23 million passenger cars during the year the 
first such shortfall since japan began limting its auto exports to 
the us market in 1981 local news reports said tuesday 
an official of the japan automobile manufacturers association 
said the figures for japans car exports to the united states would 
be announced late this month and the volume would be far below 
the 23 million vehicles sent to america the previous year 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity blamed the 
shortfall on the higher yen and the slowerthanexpected increase 
in the us car market 
japanese car makers have raised their export prices to the 
united states by more than 20 percent on the average over the past 
two years to make up for losses stemming from the dollars 
depreciation 
more significant results in the reduction of japans trade 
surplus with the united states will surely come in years to come 
murakami said its just two years since the yens appreciation 
began

six months after the stock market crash of 1987 
a sense of shock and confusion still pervades wall street 
as the days weeks and months have passed since black monday on 
oct 19 many industry leaders market analysts and investors have 
been relieved to see the damage extensive as it was apparently 
contained 
stock prices have since recovered some of their losses several 
reforms are being made in the mechanism of the marketplace itself 
and perhaps most important of all the economy has endured the 
experience with hardly any sign of significant damage 
but the crash still weighs heavily on just about any financial 
decision or economic forecast these days by all accounts it has 
severely dampened the enthusiasm of both professional money 
managers and the american public for stock investments 
trading volume in all the major stock markets so far in 1988 is 
running behind the pace it set a year ago through april 8 volume 
was down 41 percent at the new york stock stock exchange and 167 
percent in the overthecounter market 
the nyse decline would be much bigger were it not for heavy 
trading in stocks of companies targeted for takeovers and 
highyielding issues with impending dividend payments 
veteran observers caution that it will take still more time to 
assess the crashs ultimate effects even with the advantage of 
hindsight it is clear that the crash was many different things to 
many different people 
at one extreme some analysts will tell you black monday was 
just the first stage of a severe bear market that will usher in a 
recession or worse in the nations economy 
at the other some insist it was nothing more than an 
exaggerated correction that drove excessive enthusiasm out of 
the marketplace setting the stage for new rallies in stock prices 
and helping to prevent a recession that might otherwise be in 
progress today 
while there isnt yet and may never be a widely accepted 
consensus on what precisely caused the crash a good many analysts 
have come to agree that it stemmed in large measure from a change 
in the credit policies of the federal reserve and central banks of 
other prominent industrialized countries 
in this view these powerful institutions created a financial 
boom in the mid1980s by fostering the growth of a vast pool of 
liquidity or money looking for a place to go to work 
starting in early 1987 they began to shut off the flow 
prompted by fears of inflation and a long decline in the value of 
the dollar against leading foreign currencies 
economist albert wojnilower a managing director at the wall 
street firm of first boston corp said in a recent appraisal 
as 1987 wore on it became more and more evident so that 
ultimately even the stock markets had to accept the fact that 
us monetary policy was on a course leading to an eventual 
recession 
that recession didnt arrive on schedule wojnilower added 
because restrictive monetary policies were immediately abandoned in 
the aftermath of the crash 
he says a business slump is still in the offing probably in 
1989 but it need not be severe the end of the world is not at 
hand 
with all the studies investigations and reports by blueribbon 
panels that have been done since the crash major steps to reform 
and fortify the markets have come slowly or not at all 
the presidential commission headed by nicholas f brady of 
dillon read amp co promoted the idea that the nations financial 
markets the stock market and the futures market where contracts 
on stock indexes are traded could be set up and managed as one 
market 
the brady plan called for coordinating the regulation of the 
markets and installing circuit breakers that would prevent a 
crisis from erupting in one market and spreading to the other 
those who blame computerdriven program trading for contributing 
to the october debacle point out that such techniques are triggered 
by discrepancies in the prices of stock index futures and the 
underlying equities but the two markets have long operated under 
significantly different rules and have resisted regulatory changes 
that might threaten their franchises 
bradys superregulatory proposal has been bogged down by 
haggling over who would be the super regulator although the brady 
panel favored the federal reserve the central bank appears 
reluctant to take on the job 
the securities and exchange commission is more willing to fill 
the void but regulators of the futures markets have resisted the 
idea of turning over a measure of their authority to the sec 
to help sort out the competing interests the white house has 
appointed yet another committee comprised of representatives of 
the various regulatory agencies which is expected to report still 
more recommendations later this spring 
the new york stock exchange has adopted one notable new rule a 
constraint known as a collar that bars use of its main 
orderprocessing system for one method of program trading should 
the dow jones industrial average rise or fall on any given day by 
as much as 50 points 
in addition the nyse has announced a sharp increase in the 
amount of capital that must be held by its specialists the brokers 
who act as meeting points for buy and sell orders on the trading 
floor 
separately the national association of securities dealers has 
moved to try to strengthen the overthecounter market for unlisted 
stocks which it oversees 
by summer nasd procedures are scheduled to be in effect to 
decrease the markets dependency on voice communication by 
telephone and to punish dealers who back away from fastmoving 
markets without a specialcase excuse 
the aim of such measures is to increase the markets strength 
and accessibility in times of stress so that the machinery doesnt 
break down altogether and turn an already bad situation into a 
disaster 
still many regulators and securities industry officials say it 
would be pointless and quite possibly dangerous to attempt to 
legislate away the threat of any future crashes 
if the fed were standing by with its enormous resources as a 
buyer of last resort in times of crisis presumably the stock 
market would be less susceptible if not immune to panics but 
something like that would also cost the market what joseph 
hardiman president of the nasd calls the discipline of risk 
if investors believed they could rely indefinitely on an 
institution like the fed to support the market they might well go 
on a speculative binge that would create stresses not even the fed 
could deal with 
under this line of reasoning the quickest way to set the stage 
for the next market crash would be to create a system to assure 
everybody that it could never happen again

the strength of the us economy since the oct 
19 stock market crash has demolished the belief that history 
invariably repeats itself 
generations of schoolchildren learned that the stock market 
crashed in october 1929 and the nation then slid into a depression 
from which it did not fully recover until world war ii 
last years crash was even bigger than 1929s half a trillion 
dollars of stock wealth was wiped out in a single day as the dow 
jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 508 points a record 
226 percent 
yet six months later the unemployment rate is at a nineyear 
low and industries such as steel paper and chemicals are straining 
to keep up with booming demand 
in fact many economists now believe the crash helped keep the 
economic expansion alive by throwing cold water on inflation fears 
and bringing about lower interest rates 
suddenly the idea of a crashing stock market doesnt seem so 
frightening especially to the 80 percent of households that dont 
own stock 
of course fearful chart watchers point out that even though the 
dow average is rebounding now it also rebounded after the 1929 
crash 
they note that while president reagan is optimistic in april 
1988 president herbert hoover was optimistic in april 1930 
by extension the pessimists conclude that history may yet 
repeat itself poverty they say may be just around the corner 
the attempt to draw parallels falls short however 
people who argue that history will repeat itself simply dont 
understand history said richard day an economist at the 
university of southern california 
history shows that stock indexes may repeat previous patterns 
for a few months but inevitably go off in different directions day 
said 
the economy of 1988 is far healthier and more resistant to 
shocks than the economy of 1930 was for example 
the rise of service jobs means americans are more insulated 
from the ups and downs of farming and manufacturing two sectors 
that led the way into the great depression 
unemployment insurance social security and other programs 
protect americans and the economy as a whole from sudden drops in 
income 
the 1929 crash came against the backdrop of recession 
industrial production had fallen at an annual rate of 20 percent 
since august of that year prices and incomes fell too this time 
production prices and incomes have all been rising 
world trade spiraled downward in the late 1920s and early 1930s 
because of slumping economies and protectionism this time world 
trade is expanding and the crash helped dissuade congress from 
enacting a replay of the infamous smoothawley tariff act of 1930 
finally new deal regulatory reforms instituted in the 1930s 
such as federal deposit insurance helped keep wall streets fear 
from infecting the banking system this time the federal reserve 
which bungled its job after the 1929 crash acted quickly to quell 
panic 
money is not disappearing into mattresses said brent 
erensel senior banking analyst at donaldson lufkin amp jenrette 
securities corp consumer confidence rebounded to precrash levels 
within months 
economists worried last fall that wall street was a canary in a 
coal mine sending an early warning of disaster now many believe 
the signal was false 
these sudden drops caused by this kind of stampede 
behavior you just kind of ignore that it doesnt give you much 
information said william brock a university of wisconsin 
economist 
to be sure the us economy is not glowingly healthy last 
year 184 banks failed the most since the depression but the 
closings were orderly not triggered by bank runs in the 1930s 
panics forced thousands of banks to close annually 
depositors assume correctly that regulators will not allow 
major banks to fail said christopher mahoney an associate 
director at moodys investors service inc 
there are other problems the trade deficit the budget deficit 
the third world debt bomb unemployment and poverty persist in an 
underclass of disadvantaged minorities 
but the problems while worrisome dont point to a 1930sstyle 
depression most economists say 
right after the monday massacre people said oh my god here 
we go again but now no one is quite certain why the crash 
occurred or what it means wisconsins brock said 
as one jokester said if we could have another one of these 
maybe we could settle this debate

the japanese stock markets unrelenting climb to 
new heights since black monday has made the land of the rising sun 
and its booming economy the envy of every market struggling to 
regain lost momentum 
unlike the crash when markets from brussels belgium to 
singapore plummeted in reaction to wall streets collapse the 
recovery of world markets since oct 19 has been relatively uneven 
markets have followed the pace of their own economies and 
investors who once roamed the globe in search of equities have 
returned to the backyard markets they know best 
i dont think i could describe any spillover effects said 
robert brusca chief economist at nikko securities co 
international inc its more the case that stock markets seem to 
be tracking economic growth internally 
so far this year major stock markets outside the united states 
are up about 135 percent according to an index compiled by morgan 
stanley amp co while the us market is up about 45 percent 
european markets have turned in a mixed performance since the 
crash the brussels exchange is up on takeover activity west 
germanys market is sluggish and a slowgrowing french economy is 
taking its toll on the bourse 
but if those markets show glimmers of life the advance has been 
blinding in japan home of the worlds biggest equities market 
while the dow jones industrial average has sputtered to and fro 
beneath precrash levels japans key market barometer has reached 
stunning alltime highs with ease 
the key nikkei 100share index breezed its way into record 
territory in early april 
the story this year really is mostly a story about japan 
said mark sladkus a vice president at morgan stanley but he 
noted the markets momentum isnt due to its magnetic attraction 
for investors outside the island nation 
its totally due to domestic considerations sladkus said 
spurred by a roaring financial boom japans stock market is 
reaping the benefits of a surge in corporate profits a sharp 
increase in consumption and tax reforms that are likely to prompt 
consumers to move their money out of savings accounts and into 
equities 
while the quick aboutface isnt causing japanese investors to 
lose any sleep some on the other side of the ocean watch with 
furrowed brows 
theres concern that with the market going up so strongly and 
with the economy growing that maybe the bank of japan is not going 
to be as accommodative brusca said noting that some fear 
japans central bank could take away one important underpinning 
of the market the liquidity that helped spur the growth in the 
first place 
nobody is quite comfortable that a country the size of 
california and with half the population of the united states has 
the biggest stock market even though the japanese seem to do 
everything right said byron wien managing director and us 
investment strategist at morgan stanley 
in london the financial timesstock exchange 100share index 
remains about 25 percent below its level just prior to the crash 
despite the fact that the market has been extremely volatile 
analysts arent too concerned about the speed of its recovery 
the equity market was overvalued before the crash said 
randal goldsmith a market strategist with the london investment 
firm james capel amp co theres no reason to go right back up to 
that level yet 
the market has been supported by an increase in the number of 
companies buying back their own shares heightened takeover 
activity betterthanexpected corporate profits and relief that 
the economy wasnt hit harder by the crash 
thanks to the takeover battle for societe generale de belgique 
the largest belgian corporation the brussels bourse has put in the 
best performance among the european exchanges 
in hong kong where the stock exchange shut down for four days 
following black monday trading volume stalled and investor 
confidence had to be rebuilt from the ground up but the market is 
enjoying some spillover enthusiasm from japan since the asian 
investment community is linked together brusca noted 
west germany on the other hand is a dog if you will its a 
real barker brusca said theyve been experiencing sluggish 
growth their monetary policy remains restrictive and their 
currency is appreciating which makes it difficult for german firms 
to sell their products overseas for a profit he said 
trading volume throughout the world has been relatively light 
which analysts say is a sign of confusion among investors 
to alleviate fears of the unknown international investors went 
home 
people were operating in markets overseas that they didnt 
understand that well and so they brought their money home these 
markets may not be doing so well but at least investors understand 
them brusca said

the federal aviation administration is 
investigating safety complaints from airlines about boeing 747 and 
767 widebody jets and has issued a safety inspection directive for 
one of the aerospace companys jetliner models 
faa officials revealed monday that an airworthiness 
directive on the 747200 was issued friday because of reports 
that fuel leaking into cargo compartments 
boeing commercial airplanes officials refused monday to respond 
to the airline complaints or comment on the faa action but said 
they would hold a news conference later 
however phil a condit executive vice president of boeing 
commercial airplanes was quoted in todays editions of the wall 
street journal as saying letters from the airlines represent 
communications that go on between us and airlines all the time 
thats how we make our products better 
airline boeing and faa officials have noted that none of the 
defects cited to date has been linked to a crash or other major 
damage but the directive warned fuel in this cargo 
compartment could result in a fire and substantial damage 
the directive said the leaks were caused by loose or broken 
bolts that attach fuel tanks to the wings and called for repairs 
before further flight boeing officials said the order applied 
to 317 operating 747200s 
nick wantiez of the local faa office said monday the 
investigation also would cover airline complaints ranging from 
wrong parts to incorrectly installed firefighting systems 
we are putting together a plan this week to deal with these 
complaints and to determine what actions must be taken to assure 
compliance with federal regulations wantiez said 
he said the inspection order followed reports of incidents by 
japan air lines northwest airlines lufthansa air india 
aerolineas argentinas and a leasing company starting nov 21 with 
a jal report in los angeles of a fuel leak involving a bold that 
had broken from corrosion 
david jimenez of boeing confirmed monday that letters citing 
problems in 767s and 747s had been received from japan air lines 
all nippon airways british airways and american airlines 
problems cited by all nippon included a wing flap disintegrating 
in flight on the first day of service smoke from a misassembled 
power unit that caused an emergency landing and problems in a fire 
extinguisher system 
bob baker americans senior vice president for operations said 
his companys maintenance crews found three 767200s with faulty 
pipelines that carry firefighting chemicals to the forward and rear 
cargo compartments 
the pipes were misrouted baker said if you light them 
off for the forward belly system they go off in the rear 
baker said that after being informed by american boeing found 
one faulty system on its production line and all nippon and jal 
found several in their planes

for richard s locke ef hutton group incs 
postcrash demise derailed a 13year career at the onceproud 
investment giant leaving him jobless 
dean thompson scrambled to start his own company after huttons 
new parent shearson lehman brothers inc fired him jack clevenger 
was among the luckier ones shearson invited him to stay 
hutton was the biggest wall street casualty in the aftermath of 
the oct 19 collapse in stock prices already reeling from 
management struggles excessive expenses declining profits and the 
legacy of an embarassing checkkiting scandal the crash sent the 
company into a desperate search for a buyer 
the new shearson lehman hutton inc describes itself as one of 
the strongest and biggest brokerages but the marriage has left at 
least 6000 people out of work 
i was concerned long before the crash that the end was near 
locke said in an interview nothing lasts forever wed had a 
bull market for five years the compensation had gotten out of 
hand 
locke former senior executive vice president and managing 
director of huttons public finance unit had at one time been in 
charge of more than 80 investment bankers and earned a 700000 
salary 
when shearson acquired hutton in december locke said he was at 
first invited to say but quickly discovered there was no place for 
him in the merged operation i felt redundant we parted 
friends he said 
now the 50yearold veteran spends his time visiting potential 
job contacts and using a borrowed office and telephone to arrange 
interviews he is considering moving to the west coast and might 
start his own consulting firm 
i dont know what october 19th was a signal or an accident 
he said but i think wall street faces much more consolidation 
locke said his only hutton memento is an antique he and his wife 
bought a carvedout pig from a butchers shop with the 
inscription huttons for pork 
but locke said he harbored no bitterness toward hutton ive 
been in this business too long to get angry he said 
for thompson who had worked at shearsons parent american 
express co before he quit and went to hutton four years ago as 
vice president in charge of its inhouse financial video unit 
there was a bitter irony in the acquisition in a roundabout way 
i was hoist by my own petard said thompson 41 dad came back 
and sucked us up 
thompson said he earned nearly 100000 at hutton producing an 
internal monthly news show sales promotions and advertising like 
everybody else at hutton he was well aware of the companys 
problems but wasnt prepared for the sudden finale 
the big shock was the speed with which it took place he 
said of the merger announcement twelve days later we were 
fired 
with a halfdozen other people in his department thompson 
negotiated to acquire huttons video production facilities housed 
in a secondfloor office building in manhattans wholesale 
merchandise district north of wall street 
thompson started metro production group inc which has since 
received video production assignments from several financial 
service companies 
dressed in casual clothes behind a simple black desk in his 
office thompson was philosophical about the sudden change and said 
he expected to do as well if not better 
nevertheless he said lets face it when i saw the movie 
broadcast news i loved the line where the fired executive told 
the boss i hope you die real soon 
for clevenger who started with hutton in 1969 the shearson 
acquisition injected stability and relief as a first vice 
president in huttons consulting services unit in kansas city 
clevenger had long been worried because of client concerns about 
huttons health 
i was pleased that the merger happened said the 42yearold 
father of two 
he wouldnt disclose his salary but as one of the senior people 
in huttons nationwide network he was among the highest paid 
although his postcrash business is down 20 percent clevenger 
said im guessing that when the years over ill be in 
approximately the same position with the combined firm 
nevertheless he said he had some regrets about huttons 
collapse 
im remorseful because of what it did to a group of people 
that i relate to particularly the 600 or 700 people who are part 
of our division some of the closeness has gone because some of 
these people have left he said

when recruiters for accounting giant touche ross 
amp co visited graduate business schools earlier this year students 
scrambled to get interviews at the same time the venerable 
investment banking firm goldman sachs amp co had trouble finding 
good candidates 
the contrast illustrates what students school officials and 
campus recruiters agree is a disillusionment with wall street 
careers in the aftermath of the october stock market crash and a 
corresponding surge of interest in highpaying consulting and 
accounting professions 
we found here that the presentations investment banks made 
were not attended well at all said joyce watts director of 
career counseling and placement at northwestern universitys jl 
kellogg graduate school of management thats very different than 
in the last five years when you could hardly get in the door of a 
presentation 
graduate business students participating in a recent conference 
at northwestern said that consulting positions which offer 
starting salaries ranging from 50000 to 100000 are a lot more 
attractive than investment banking careers now because of the 
employment uncertainty raised by the crash 
a good part of my class had pegged hopes on wall street 
said mark sheridan a 28yearold cornell university business 
student at the conference you see a lot of chameleons out there 
suddenly theyre all into consulting 
several schools have projected sharp reductions in the number of 
students who will go into investment banking this year at kellogg 
for example only about 12 percent will accept wall street offers 
down from 17 percent last year columbia university expects about 
15 percent down from 28 percent and pennsylvanias wharton school 
expects about 15 percent down from 25 percent 
wall street firms themselves have been curtailing campus 
recruitment drives this year partly because they are undergoing 
their own postcrash retrenchment but many have found the pool of 
mba talent has shrunk 
this year weve had more people turn down jobs than in the 
past five years said james p gorter a goldman sachs partner 
who spoke at the northwestern conference 
roy cohen manager of professional recruiting at merrill lynch

new york city the epicenter of last octobers 
stock market quake remains jumpy at any aftershocks and watches 
warily for warning signs of future trouble 
so far so good is the opinion of samuel ehrenhalt the 
regional commissioner of the federal bureau of labor statistics 
the economy has held up better than most expected but we still 
havent got the situation fully in focus 
among the fuzzy images six months later 
the city whose financial worries faded during the bull market 
has scaled back its plans for growth the goal of a 30000member 
police department is on hold two firehouses are closed and 
museums and libraries found their budgets cut 
the real estate market though still inflated by standards of 
most american cities has lost some steam with office vacancy 
rates up several construction projects on hold and condos no 
longer guaranteed to skyrocket in value 
unemployment figures remain stable overall but layoffs in the 
financial sector may show up in the statistics later as severance 
pay runs out for some and as businesses that depend on wall street 
are forced to follow suit 
the city adopted a cautious stance almost immediately after the 
crash within 10 days mayor edward i koch had ordered a 90day 
hiring freeze 
we needed the three months to evaluate what the crash meant 
said anthony shorris deputy director of the city office of 
management and budget the city recalculated its projections for 
fiscal 1989 july 1 to june 30 1989 and figured its tax 
revenues would be about 270 million less than expected 
a lot of people were doomsayers taking terrible grim 
positions after the crash shorris said in context 270 
million out of a tax base of 14 billion is hardly a major change 
but there was a reduction of growth 
the slowdown in the local economy will force the city to keep a 
tight rein on spending plans to expand the sanitation department 
were cut by 260 positions the department of cultural affairs saw 
its fiscal 1989 budget cut by 56 million libraries will get 77 
million less than originally expected which will probably result 
in shorter hours and other cuts in services 
yet shorris said the true effect of the crash shows up not so 
much in the data about the city that pours into his office but in 
conversations and attitudes across the nation 
more than the crash itself it was reevaluation of nations 
economy that was the most important byproduct shorris said 
that has a very important effect on us new york city has been 
more affected than almost any other city or state because of the 
high concentration of security and finance activity 
one obvious casualty of the crash was a twotower office complex 
planned for the southwest corner of central park with the 
investment firm salomon brothers as the prime tenant though the 
firm gave a variety of reasons for pulling out of the project the 
crash and subsequent cutbacks contributed 
that also hurt the city which was counting on selling the 
property for 455 million including 40 million in subway 
improvements 
theres really been a reassessment of new construction 
several projects have been put on hold as a result of black 
monday said lloyd lynford a real estate market analyst and 
publisher of an industry newsletter 
the office vacancy rate was at 9 percent in october and may be 
in the 14 percent range by the end of this year lynford said 
noting that one percentage point represents 35 million square feet 
or more than half of one of the world trade center towers 
in the residential market he said unless youre talking 
about the premier residential units in the city there has been and 
will be a comparatively more sluggish market than it has been the 
last couple of years with slower rates of appreciation 
much of the shifting in the real estate market both office and 
residential can be traced to job cuts in the financial services 
industry he said from 1982 to 1987 25 percent of the citys job 
growth was in financial services 
new york city is making a new transition into an economic 
environment characterized by uncertainty risk and vulnerability in 
its dependence for growth on wall street and the financial 
industry said ehrenhalt 
were not out of the woods yet

the stock market was mixed in light trading 
today as the market its digested recent gains and investors waited 
for fresh economic data to be released later in the week 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials was up 232 at 209831 
by midafternoon 
losers slightly outnumbered gainers by about 10 to 9 in the 
overall tally of new york stock exchangelisted issues with 722 
down 681 up and 519 unchanged 
volume on the big board came to 9548 million shares at 2 pm 
on wall street 
the volume is very light and what it shows is that theres no 
enthusiasm said ronald daino a technical analyst at smith 
barney harris upham amp co 
analysts were not surprised that the market was little changed 
noting that the impressive 10213point rise the dow posted last 
week had to be digested while the market appeared to be staying 
put throughout the session most analysts agreed there are positive 
underpinnings for equities 
the market went up a long way and we expect it to 
retrench said hidegarde zagorski vice president of 
prudentialbache securities inc but once the selling is over 
it will move into higher ground 
meanwhile many investors remain on the sidelines as they await 
the release of new economic data while they are certain to focus 
on februarys merchandise trade report due out on thursday the 
release of retail sales figures and a meeting of the group of seven 
major industrial countries both scheduled for wednesday are 
likely to attract attention 
a lot of people are going to play it close to the vest until 
they see some direction from the numbers coming out said peter 
vandenberg a vice president at shearson lehman hutton inc 
analysts also noted that investors are once again confronting 
what has become a psychological barrier at the 2100level on the 
dow indeed the key market barometer touched 2101 shortly after 
noon but then eased back 
the dow has bumped its head against that level so many times 
so there is some hesitation when it approaches the mark zagorski 
said 
honda motor was the shining star in an otherwise dull auto 
sector rising 3 to 146 aircraft issues were lower with boeing 
falling to 46 the federal aviation administration said it would 
conduct an investigation into alleged defects in the some of the

government participants in airbus industrie 
approved guidelines tuesday to overhaul management of the european 
aircraft consortium and make it more accountable financially 
the approval came against a background of intense competition 
between airbus and us aircraft makers who complain that the 
company sells planes more cheaply because of unfair government aid 
airbus denies the accusations but has been under increased internal 
pressure to become more efficient 
british trade and industry minister kenneth clarke spanish 
industry minister luis carlos croissier german economy ministry 
state secretary erich riedl and french transport minister jacques 
douffiagues approved the guidelines contained in a report 
presented by four consultants one from each country calling for 
fundamental management changes 
clarke told a news conference the ministers reached what he 
called surprisingly speedy agreement on the need for a management 
restructuring aimed at cutting costs clarifying costs and 
expenses accelerating decisionmaking and running the operation 
on clear commercial lines 
the report asserts that despite an increase in production and 
sales airbus industrie had failed to reduce costs and increase 
efficiency 
based in toulouse france airbus was created in 1970 by the 
french firm aerospatiale british aerospace plc 
messerschmittboelkowblohm gmbh of west germany and construcciones 
aeronauticas sa casa of spain with the aid of the governments 
of britain west germany france and spain 
aerospatiale and mbb gmbh each own 379 percent of airbus while 
british aerospace owns 20 percent and casa 42 percent combined 
assets of the consortium exceed 12 billion 
riedl called the general agreement tueday among the officials 
a giant step forward 
airbus industries pioneer stage is now something weve 
definitely left behind airbus has come of age he said 
the officials called for airbus and its industrial partners to 
present detailed plans of action to implement the recommendations 
at a meeting may 5 in hannover west germany 
croissier said the officials did not discuss us officials 
accusations of unfair government subsidies to airbus in the tuesday 
meeting but said recent talks between european economic community 
officials and us trade officials had led to a better climate 
clarke said the four governments aimed to revamp airbus 
management structure so that government support is reduced 
airbus has received orders for more than 1000 aircraft 
including from five of the top 10 us airlines and carved out an 
estimated 20 percent share of the world jetliner business 
competing against us builders boeing co and mcdonnell douglas 
corp which dominate the industry 
the treasuries of britain france and west germany financed 
development of two new airbus models but now the governments 
believe it is time the consortium begins to function like a public 
company 
clarke said the importance of the accord to overhaul airbus 
management structure is that airbus will have to become a project 
economically feasible on its own 
croissier called airbus industrie by far the most succesful 
european industrial cooperation project 
the socalled four wise mens report the officials approved 
tuesday called for turning the airbus consortium into a public 
limited company by 1992 revamping the supervisory board to 
increase policy control and creating a financial director post to 
account for program costs profits and losses

shareholders of societe generale de 
belgique sa meet thursday to seal the fate of the company that is 
older than belgium and controls a third of its economy 
the meeting also will decide the fate of the 3monthold hostile 
bid of italian industrialistfinancier carlo de benedetti which 
has bogged down in a swamp of legal political and managerial 
conflicts 
de benedettis offer rocked the company long home to the 
blueblooded cream of belgiums business leaders and one in which 
belgian royalty and the roman catholic church are said to have 
shares 
de benedetti head of italys olivetti spa claims he and his 
allies own as much as 49 percent of shares in 166yearold societe 
generale 
his bid has spawned a rival alliance led by cie financiere de 
suez of france and groupe ag belgiums biggest insurer that 
claims a 507 percent stake 
after months of conflicting statements and claims the 
extraordinary shareholders meeting which de benedetti called must 
show who owns what exactly 
analysts say the meeting may turn into a peace conference or a 
showdown anything is possible said maurice lippens head of 
groupe ag 
some 1000 shareholders and 200 journalists are to attend the 
meeting in a specially built tent at the companys headoffice 
lippens has said de benedetti must agree to share in management 
of societe generale not run it 
but de benedetti has said he seeks a free hand in societe 
generale which has stakes in some 1300 companies around the globe 
active in just about every field of industrial endeavor 
he wants to turn the company into a paneuropean holding before 
1992 when the european economic community is to remove borders 
within the eec and with it a thicket of regulatory restrictions 
his search for control is entirely in character 
early in his career de benedetti 53 left the board of fiat 
spa when it was too slow in adopting his ideas for change he went 
to olivetti whose fortunes he turned around after taking control of 
the italian office automation giant 
the battle for societe generale has drawn companies from eight 
nations into the fray in a hodgepodge of coalitions 
frances suez has a stake of 30 percent of the shares 
its main partner is belgiums groupe ag which only has a share 
of 378 percent in all the agsuez camp totals a dozen or so 
belgian french luxembourg and swiss firms 
de benedettis allies include shearson lehman hutton inc of the 
united states and other us swiss and australian finance companies 
he has created a holding company for some of the shares in his 
stable to attract major european companies the swiss food giant 
nestle sa has agreed to buy into it and philips the dutch 
communications and electronics company may follow suit 
the confrontation over societe generale is more than just 
counting heads 
for one thing the target was long considered untouchable 
societe generale was founded 1822 by king william i of the 
netherlands eight years before belgium became independent of dutch 
rule and for years was belgiums central bank 
today its interests extend to mining energy financial 
services chemicals and engineering and its estimated worth is 3 
billion 
de benedettis bid led societe generale to isse 12 million new 
shares this has sparked several court cases which will likely take 
years to produce a final settlement and adding confusion to a 
takeover bid already riddled with complex alliances 
andre leysen head of belgiums gevaert group a onetime rival 
but now an ally of de benedetti has called the saga dallas 
but without women referring to the popular american television 
series

soybean futures closed lower tuesday on the 
chicago board of trade as profittaking erased some of last weeks 
dramatic gains corn futures also retreated while wheat advanced 
soybeans started the session on a weak note and slipped even 
lower during the day but firmed near the end of trading to finish 
down only a few cents 
they came up fairly good on commercial buying said joel 
karlin a research analyst for research department inc in chicago 
corn futures retreated in sympathy with soybeans dim prospects 
for corn exports and indications that the agriculture department 
may move to make more surplus corn available on the open market 
pressured corn futures karlin said 
wheat was supported by reports that china had bid for 500000 
metric tons of us wheat offered under the usdas subsidized 
export sales program and by indications that india is seeking to 
buy us wheat he said 
at the close wheat was unchanged to 2 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in may at 319 a bushel corn was cent to 
1 cents lower with may at 206 a bushel oats were cent to 1

harvard university was granted a patent for a 
genetically altered mouse today the first time a us patent has 
been issued for an animal 
the laboratory mice were altered to make them more susceptible 
to cancer and have been in use in experiments at harvard since 
1984 said university spokeswoman lilliam blacker 
patent commissioner donald j quigg said using the animal will 
simplify cancer research and make it easier to test both 
cancercausing substances and chemicals that fight cancer 
the action drew fire from jeremy rifkin who heads a coalition 
of groups opposed to genetic engineering 
he termed the action a usurpation of power by the patent office 
noting that there have been discussions in congress of imposing a 
moratorium on such patents until ethical questions can be worked 
out 
quigg however said that the patent application which was 
filed in 1984 met the legal criteria for a patent and so one was 
issued ethical questions he said need to be settled in congress 
and the medical laboratories not the patent office 
while this was the first patent on an animal plants and forms 
of bacteria have been patented previously 
the supreme court in 1980 ruled that manmade life organisms 
could be patented but the harvard patent is the first to protect a 
genetic change in a higher life form 
the patent was issued to harvard university with the inventors 
listed as philip leder and timothy a stewart 
quigg said his office has 21 other applications for animal 
patents pending details could not be disclosed however he said 
he said that virtually any changed animal could be patented 
except humans 
patents allow the inventor the exclusive right to use a product 
for 17 years although in practice the patent holder usually 
licenses use of the product for a fee 
this opens the floodgates for a whole range of patents from 
fish to house pets said jack doyle of the environmental policy 
institute which supports a moratorium on animal patents 
but geoffrey karny a washington patent attorney said the 
action was not a radical departure from existing policy 
granting a patent on animals is an entirely logical 
application of existing patent law principles and in many respects 
is nothing different from what society has been doing with regard 
to the commercial ownership of animals for thousands of years

entertainerbusinessman merv griffin stepped 
up the pressure tuesday in his attempt to gain control of resorts 
international inc announcing he will make a 105 million tender 
offer for a majority of the companys stock 
new york investor donald trump who controls 88 percent of the 
hotelcasino operators voting power rejected the offer out of 
hand calling it a feeble and futile attempt to recast his prior 
offers to further confuse the marketplace 
the 36pershare offer to stockholders to be initiated within 
the next five days follows griffins march 30 offer to management 
to acquire all of resorts class a common shares the earlier offer 
also is for 36 a share 
our new tender offer would effectively give resorts class a 
shareholders the opportunity to vote on griffins march 30 bid 
now said michael nigris president of the griffin co 
the offer would carry the condition that at least 29 million 
shares be offered a majority of the 57 million shares of class a 
other conditions are that resorts board approve the merger and 
that it agree to sell griffin 12 million newly issued shares of 
class b stock for 36 a share the class b stock carries 100 votes 
per share while the class a carries one vote per share 
the last condition also part of griffins original offer would 
require the company to issue additional class b stock and would 
give him more voting strength than trump trump owns 95 percent of 
the 572000 class b shares that presently exist 
in his response trump again made clear he has no intention of 
sharing control of the company with griffin the former talk show 
host who has built a private entertainment and real estate empire 
mr trump explained that mr griffins latest offer contained 
nothing new and is still contingent upn mr trumps aproval an 
approval which will never be granted his news release said 
a special committee of resorts management met with a griffin 
representative friday to discuss his efforts to buy the company 
but resolved nothing said harvey freeman executive vice president 
of the trump organization and a director of resorts

the chairman of batus inc told the 
nations third largest home and auto insurer tuesday his company is 
ready to open friendly merger talks and boost its 435 billion 
takeover offer 
patrick sheehy made the proposal in a letter sent to 
representatives of the farmers group inc which is based in los 
angeles on monday farmers group had indicated that it is willing 
to open talks with batus under certain conditions 
in overthecounter trading farmers group edged up 12 cents a 
share to close at 65 a share 
sheehy said the louisvillebased batus a subsidiary of the

outstanding as of april 1 batus already owns 696000 shares of 
farmers stock putting the value of its offer for the stock it does 
not own at 435 billion 
sheehy also said batus would like to receive the same 
confidential information that farmers had made available to other 
parties 
sheehy asked however that the confidentiality agreement be 
modified to ensure that there would be no unreasonable 
restrictions on the freedom of batus to pursue its offer if 
negotiations failed and that a fully level playing field would be 
established between batus and any other potential acquirer 
tom welch director of corporate investments for farmers said 
the next step will be for our attorneys to look over their 
request for a modification of the agreement then we will respond 
to them but i dont know when that will be

the company has been resisting overtures from batus overtures 
but altered its position monday in a letter from leo e denlea jr

batus only if you are prepared to state unequivocally that batus 
is in fact prepared to offer a higher price and if so what that 
price is i am requesting hereby that you advise us without delay 
of any higher offer you are prepared to make 
denleas letter also offered to share confidential information 
disclosed to other potential suitors if batus agreed to 
confidentiality guidelines 
you should be aware that at this point farmers board of 
directors has made no decision to pursue a sale of the company

continuous review depending on your response to the request made 
herein and other circumstances the board of directors may or may 
not revise its decision

foreign exchange markets waited for a key finance ministers 
meeting and the release of us trade deficit figures 
gold prices were mixed republic national bank of new york 
quoted a late bid of 45020 for a troy ounce of gold down 50 
cents from 45070 monday 
traders said there was little foreign exchange activity in 
advance of wednesdays meeting of finance ministers from the seven 
major industrialized countries and the release of us trade 
figures for february on thursday 
in the meantime the dollar was holding up very well going 
nowhere said ted wolicki a trader with continental illinois 
national bank amp trust co in chicago 
the finance ministers are expected to discuss the dollar west 
german finance minister gerhard stoltenberg has said they are 
likely to reaffirm decembers agreement on economicpolicy 
cooperation and the stabilization of exchange rates

the stock market hit a postcrash high tuesday 
in its sixth straight advance helped by a late wave of 
computerized buying 
the dow jones industrial average surged to close firmly above 
the 2100 mark for the first time since the stock market collapsed 
almost six months ago computertriggered buy programs a firmer 
dollar and rebounding bond prices all were credited with spurring 
the advance 
the dow average of 30 industrials jumped 1409 points to 
211008 bringing its gain in the weekold rally to a total of 
about 130 points broader market gauges also moved upward 
gaining issues outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 on the new 
york stock exchange with 879 up 621 down and 471 unchanged 
big board volume totaled 14040 million shares against 14637 
million shares in the previous session the nyses composite index 
gained 072 to 15319 
analysts noted that volume remained extremely light initially 
indicating a lack of investor enthusiasm but then serving to 
accentuate the move upward once buyers stepped in 
stocks were mixed early in the session and the market appeared 
to lack direction 
the dow average tentatively touched 2100 around noon but 
quickly retreated it was not until the key market barometer held 
above that level in midafternoon that investors discarded their 
inhibitions over equities 
when the dow went above 2100 decisively it attracted new 
buyers said michael metz a vice president and technical analyst 
with oppenheimer amp co 
the 2100 mark had become somewhat of a psychological barrier 
the dow average flirted with that level on several recent 
occasions but investors seemed reluctant to make it stick 
a lot of market watchers are getting nervous that they missed 
something on the upside metz said referring to the many 
investors who sat on the sidelines awaiting fresh economic data due 
out later this week 
a lot of people have missed this move he said 
some inactive investors hoped the commerce departments release 
of februarys merchandise trade data on thursday would lend clues 
to the state of the economy 
many were playing it close to the vest until they see some 
direction from the numbers coming out said peter vandenberg a 
vice president at smith barney harris upham amp co 
besides the trade figures retail sales figures were due out 
wednesday the same day the socalled group of seven industrialized 
nations was set to hold a meeting that could have implications for 
the dollar

a former top salesman for us sprint 
communications co told stockholders of one of the companys parent 
corporations tuesday that us sprint is rife with mismanagement and 
he should become its president 
paul walton who last year received a 174 million settlement 
from us sprint over unpaid commissions said us sprints management 
is totally out of touch with the telecommunications industry 
managements thinking is years behind the times walton said 
in an interview following the annual meeting of united 
telecommunications inc of westwood a suburb of kansas city mo 
united telecom is joint owner of us sprint with gte corp of 
stamford conn 
walton a 32yearold former school teacher from san diego has 
campaigned from college campuses to wall street in an attempt to 
oust robert snedaker as president of us sprint hes also calling 
attention to billing problems that have plagued the company since 
its formation in 1986 
because us sprints president is not elected but is chosen by a 
sixmember partnership committee of united telecom and gte walton 
wants shareholders to pressure company officials to put him in 
charge 
walton got a cool reception from the approximately 200 people 
attending the meeting 
i think he means well but sprint is showing signs of coming 
around said marvin bell of lenexa kan a shareholder what 
hes saying really isnt an issue any more 
us sprint based in kansas city mo is the nations 
thirdlargest longdistance telephone company behind american 
telephone amp telegraph co and mci communications corp 
us sprint lost 11 billion last year on revenues of 31 
billion analysts have predicted that the company would lose from 
115 million to 140 million in the quarter that ended march 31 
william t esrey united telecoms president and chief executive 
officer conceded tuesday that us sprints losses for the first 
quarter of 1988 likely would be more than the 116 million loss in 
the last quarter of 1987 
us sprint probably wont turn a profit in 1988 but its losses 
should decline in 1988 esrey said he told stockholders that us 
sprints fiberoptic longdistance telephone network and other 
technological advancements would boost its share of the market and 
help trim losses 
esrey also said the billing problems some customers werent 
billed for months or have been charged for calls they didnt make 
have been cleared up 
however walton who was fired in july 1986 after sending a 
letter to esrey complaining about customer service and not 
receiving commissions on some of the 600000 sprint accounts he had 
signed up challenged esreys remarks 
everywhere i go people come up to me and tell me horror 
stories about us sprint he said their service hasnt been 
connected they dont receive bills theyre billed for calls they 
dont make or a collection agency is after them because of 
companycaused errors theres just no excuse 
esrey declined to comment on waltons charges but agreed with 
walton that the price of the companys stock should be higher 
walton said he also will appear at gtes stockholders meeting 
april 20 
walton and his supporters have handed out tshirts buttons and 
bumper stickers promoting his candidacy which he expects to cost 
60000 
its clear that they dont know the best ways of running the 
company he said im willing to roll up my sleeves and work 
18hour days seven days a week like i once did for this company 
we need a change in management change in direction and an 
entrepreneurial approach

the fiscal 1989 budget hides the true size of 
the federal deficit because it factors in huge surpluses from the 
social security system and other programs senators said tuesday 
while considering the 11 trillion spending plan 
by an 858 vote the senate gave preliminary approval to an 
amendment to the budget urging the lawmakers to discount the 
surpluses amassed by two funds set aside for highway and aviation 
projects when calculating the federal deficit 
the two funds have a combined projected surplus of 2 billion 
for next year 
the senate budget blueprint officially predicts the deficit 
problem is easing 
but under an amendment offered by sen lawton chiles dfla 
chairman of the budget committee the mammoth surplus the social 
security program accumulates each year would no longer be counted 
when figuring the federal deficit that amendment could be voted on 
as early as wednesday 
the deficit is heading up not down said chiles 
the senate budget which chiles helped write predicts the red 
ink will shrink to 136 billion in the fiscal year beginning oct 
1 a drop of more than 10 billion from the amount anticipated in 
the current fiscal year 
however that counts a 46 billion surplus in social security 
which is expected to grow even larger through the beginning of the 
next century the funds then would be expended when the baby boom 
generation reaches retirement age 
sen john heinz rpa said that even if the congress and 
president meet their promise under the grammrudman law for a 
balanced budget by fiscal 1993 the deficit that year actually 
would be more than 100 billion if the social security surplus 
isnt counted 
sen dan evans rwash said he thought the amendment was an 
inadequate gesture and that major revisions of the federal 
accounting system were needed not just nonbinding legislative 
language 
there was less debate about the substance of the budget which 
would carry out the mandate of last falls deficitreduction 
agreement between president reagan and congressional leaders 
the spending plan like the agreement calls for 294 billion in 
military spending 161 billion for foreign assistance and 1692 
billion for domestic agencies outside of entitlements and other 
programs set by automatic formulas 
the senate plan features a 27 percent increase in spending on 
the space program and big boosts in aids research both requested 
by reagan education would receive 12 billion a 74 percent 
boost 
like the presidents plan the budget doesnt call for new taxes 
beyond the 14 billion for fiscal 1988 which was enacted last 
december 
the senate plan also calls for 
a 43 percent pay increase for the military and 2 percent for 
civilian federal workers reagan had requested the different pay 
boosts but the house voted for 3 percent across the board 
500 million for more farm commodities for the poor to replace 
exhausted surplus stocks 
expansion of medicaid health program and enactment of medicare 
catastrophic illness insurance assuming fees raised to pay for 
them 
an 11 percent increase for national science foundation for its 
research programs and a 25 percent increase in energy department 
nuclear physics program toward development of the superconducting 
super collider project 
a 3 percent cut in rural housing assistance along with 
reductions in elderly housing and community and regional 
development 
aviation safety increase of 19 percent from 55 billion this 
year to hire 900 more air traffic controllers and modernize the 
system 
the house budget approved last month also follows the overall 
budget guidelines of last fall but it differs in detail from the 
senate plan for example the house voted to spend more on aid to 
local communities and less on space than the senate plan 
the two chambers must agree on a single spending plan after 
which it serves as a guide for regular fiscal legislation the 
budget is a congressional resolution that does not require the 
presidents signature 
the official deadline for completing the budget is friday 
although congress is unlikely to meet that target this years 
budget action is coming at the earliest dates in years

the hazards of deregulated banking on a 
global scale demand that banks increase their reserves federal 
reserve chairman alan greenspan said tuesday 
greenspan said the need for bigger bank reserves was underscored 
last year when major banks took big losses because of reserves set 
aside to cover bad loans to latin america for some banks those 
moves erased most of a decades worth of growth in their capital 
reserves 
such losses might be digested by healthy banks in a stable 
domestic economy greenspan said but the volatile nature of 
international lending and increasing bank involvement in real 
estate insurance and securities brokering demanded a bigger safety 
net he told the conference of state bank supervisors 
last december federal banking officials and supervisory 
officials from the 10 largest industrialized nations jointly 
proposed establishing uniform international capital requirements 
the plan would set an internationally accepted minimum equity 
capital requirement and a menu of acceptable nontraditional assets 
that could supplement a banks equity base 
greenspan said the plan should be viewed as a crude first step 
in focusing attention on the need for additional reserves 
some revisions may be required over time but it provides an 
important base to allow bank organizations to adapt in years 
ahead greenspan said
