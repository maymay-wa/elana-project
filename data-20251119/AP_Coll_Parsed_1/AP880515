doubting shinns willingness to provide upfront cash in his bid 
is seeking a group of buyers more to their liking the group

at an advertising agency for shimon 
peres labor party imagemakers showed off a new brochure 
picturing a checkered arab headdress a symbol of palestinan 
nationalism with a black slash across it 
on the same day prime minister yitzhak shamir of the rival 
likud bloc worked a crowd of jewish settlers in the west bank 
telling them the israelioccupied land was thirsty for jewish 
settlements 
the campaign for israels november general elections is getting 
into gear and the main battleground for the leftofcenter labor 
party and the rightist likud is the arabisraeli conflict brought 
to a boiling point by the palestinian uprising 
both shamir and peres have told voters the outcome of the 
balloting will be crucial for the survival of the jewish state 
peres foreign minister in a strangebedfellows coalition with 
shamir has warned that likuds refusal to withdraw from any part 
of the occupied west bank and gaza strip will cost israel its 
jewish majority and democratic values 
shamir has charged that labors willingness to exchange some 
land for peace will deliver israel into the hands of its arab 
enemies 
its the first time since the 1973 middle east war that the 
peace process is a major issue in an election campaign said 
political scientist peter medding of hebrew university 
pollsters say labor is in a more difficult spot noting that 
many voters have adopted more hardline views because they feel 
threatened by the violent arab uprising in which more than 180 
palestinians and two israelis have died since dec 8 
a survey of 1200 jewish voters at the end of march showed labor 
has lost 3 percent to 4 percent to likud since december with labor 
now at 35 percent of the vote and likud at 30 percent said 
pollster hanoch smith 
the rest of the vote is divided among more than a dozen smaller 
parties that are potential coalition partners for either labor or 
likud 
if elections were held tomorrow smith said the two camps each 
would get roughly the same number of seats a repeat of the 
stalemate in the 1984 elections that forced labor and likud into 
shared rule 
their coalition always fragile has all but disintegrated since 
the uprising but neither labor nor likud has formally ruled out 
joining another mixed government in case of a stalemate 
labors campaign run under the slogan move with strength and 
brains is aimed at winning rightofcenter voters without 
alienating the left 
as a first step strategists have softened the peres peace plan 
by assuring voters they will have a final say before concessions 
are made to the palestinians 
we will emphasize the idea that there will be a plebiscite 
before any major move such as returning territory said ruth 
ofir of the kesher barel advertising agency hired by labor 
labors peace program also contains a list of nos such as 
no to a palestinian state no to talks with the palestine 
liberation organization no to a return to the 1967 borders 
the new brochure with its crossedout arab headdress is meant to 
illustrate the point it also pictures an israeli soldier guarding 
the jordan river which labor says will remain israels security 
border 
political scientist yitzhak galnoor of hebrew university 
predicted the strategy would backfire 
they are going to fall between the chairs and lose on both 
sides said galnoor the idea that you can compete with the 
hardliners of the likud proved unsuccessful in the campaigns of 
1977 1981 and 1984 
the likud is thought to be in an easier position because its 
stance for holding on to the occupied lands doesnt ask voters to 
take any immediate risks 
likud parliamentary chairman chaim kaufman said his party will 
drive home the message that we can only negotiate after we break 
arab terrorism both in the territories and outside 
kaufman acknowledged that the arab uprising has given a boost to 
his party the problem has become much clearer and people are 
now aware of what they are facing he said 
in the nov 1 election all 120 seats in the parliament are up 
for grabs israels 288 million eligible voters select the 
legislators indirectly by voting for a party slate 
each party forms a list of candidates in ranked order and the 
number of votes a party receives determines how many of its people 
make it into the knesset

inmates at an overcrowded state prison 
held three guards hostage saturday following a fiery uprising that 
left one dormitory gutted and two others damaged officials said 
one guard and one inmate were injured 
eight guards were grabbed by 10 prisoners when the disturbance 
began but five hostages were released unharmed saturday and the 
others were reported in good condition said officials at the 
mediumsecurity mack alford correctional center 
the inmates believed to be armed with crude knives threatened 
to kill their hostages if authorities attempted a rescue said 
jerry massie spokesman for the state department of corrections 
one inmate is keeping it going said prison spokeswoman 
anita trammell i think the inmates are tired we have one 
leader i think if it wasnt for the leader things would have been 
closed up 
the uprising began late friday after some inmates accused others 
of theft and threatened retaliation authorities said a group of 
the inmates was being prepared for transfer to a maximumsecurity 
prison when they seized hostages 
they released the fifth hostage in return for getting to 
talk to two specific negotiators said massie he would not 
identify the negotiators 
officials said the inmates had a short list of specific 
demands but refused to disclose what they were 
i think their primary concern is for their safety and their 
wellbeing massie said its just real nonspecific its not 
like a list of we want better food or better water 
were fine theyre feeding us theyre taking care of us 
one hostage was quoted as saying when inmates permitted him to make 
a telephone call 
the 33yearold redbrick prison was surrounded by oklahoma 
highway patrol tactical teams in camouflage clothing rifletoting 
corrections department officers and firetrucks that were used to 
battle blazes in three buildings 
officers carrying teargas launchers donned bulletproof vests in 
a parking lot and huddled around blueprints of the prison but 
officials wouldnt say if that activity signaled any impending 
action 
thats what you call contingency planning said patrol 
spokesman lt stewart meyer 
a spokesman said gov henry bellmon had no plans to call in the 
national guard to assist the law officers already on hand 
the inmates started a fire that destroyed the east dormitory at 
the mack alford correctional center then moved to another 
dormitory with their hostages massie said 
if we were to rebuild the dormitory that was destroyed similar 
to one we have at our lexington facility it would cost about 25 
million massie said adding that it was too early to estimate 
damage to the other dormitories or other prison areas 
smoke was still rising from the roof of the torched dormitory 
saturday fires in two other dormitories were doused 
authorities sealed off a section of the prison that held 82 
inmates 
ten of the 82 are participating in the hostage situation 
the others just got caught inside said ms trammell thirty to 
35 of the uninvolved inmates locked themselves in their cells she 
said 
trammell said one guard was treated after apparently being hit 
on the hand with a rock and one prisoner suffered a minor stab 
wound to the shoulder 
officers were preparing to transfer five inmates to the oklahoma 
state penitentiary in mcalester about 40 miles away when the 
disturbance began the five had reportedly threatened other inmates 
who allegedly had stolen from them 
apparently during that period of time an officer was taken 
hostage massie said other officers then were seized 
more than 500 inmates were evacuated from the prisons 
dormitories and held in a yard behind a fence topped with razor 
wire many were being transferred to other facilities throughout 
the state 
an offer to transport the inmates involved in the uprising to 
the federal prison at el reno okla apparently was rejected late 
saturday ms trammell said 
family members of some of the hostages gathered at a secluded 
area outside the facility in rural southeastern oklahoma near the 
texas border 130 miles southeast of oklahoma city 
mack alford with 652 inmates has the sixthlargest prison 
population in oklahoma but has an operational capacity of 492 
massie said the prison opened in 1955 he said

new york gov mario cuomo said saturday it 
appears michael dukakis will win the democratic presidential 
nomination but the party will need the aid of jesse jackson and 
his supporters to win in november 
a jesse jackson who is an impassioned part of the effort to 
support mike dukakis if mike wins and thats the way it looks 
that would be helpful absolutely cuomo said at a news 
conference following a speech to the world affairs council of 
oregon 
cuomo stopped short of endorsing dukakis although he promised 
to come out in favor of the races frontrunner before the 
convention 
i have great respect for this process he said i will not 
treat this as a makebelieve race 
at the news conference and during a questionandanswer session 
with the audience after his speech cuomo said the people who are 
supporting jacksons campaign need to be convinced that jackson is 
not the only politician who shares their concerns 
he said he met with jackson for more than an hour friday in 
california to discuss that issue 
the democratic party must assure jackson supporters that jesse 
isnt the only one who is concerned about the drug problem 
concerned about education concerned about corporations that leave 
this country to manufacture in foreign lands using cheap labor 
we have to prove to his constituency that were concerned 
about a deteriorating infrastructure and that we have a way to 
raise up funds to deal with it were concerned about a society 
where rich people have gone from a 70 percent tax down to a 28 
percent tax at the same time that you have the largest deficit 
known in the history of the nation 
during his questionandanswer session with the world affairs 
council audience he spent several minutes explaining why he 
decided not to seek the presidency mainly he said he couldnt 
run for president and continue as governor of new york 
explaining why dukakis the massachusetts governor could find 
time to run cuomo said in his state people are baptized 
democrats he can go out and campaign and his agenda will be taken 
care of 
if i leave new york for very long somebody will steal my 
desk he said 
later saturday at a gop fundraiser in seattle cuomo taunted 
bush for keeping quiet during the reagan administration and called 
on the vice president to explain his plans for the federal budget 
republicans would like us to think they have chosen george 
bush so early because they want to speak in one voice i think its 
because they have nothing to say cuomo said when the vice 
president finally does decide to use that voice i hope he tells us 
why he hasnt used that voice for eight years

vermont lawmakers approved controversial 
legislation saturday designed to preserve open land and give the 
state more control over development 
the socalled growth bill topped the legislative agenda for 
gov madeleine kunin and democrats who control both the house and 
senate its passage was expected to pave the way to the 
legislatures adjournment for the year originally targeted for 
midapril 
a conference committees compromise version of the proposal was 
approved by the senate 1713 and the house 7765 that sealed the 
success of a shaky coalition of lawmakers who favored more support 
for vermonts farmers and those who favored stronger development 
planning 
if ever there was a team effort this bill was it said rep 
stephen reynes a democrat and strong backer of the growth 
legislation 
the growth bill was the legislatures response to a report 
produced by a special governors commission on vermonts future 
formed last year and headed by vermont law school dean douglas 
costle 
the bill provides 75 million in direct subsidies to dairy 
farmers for one year a 50cent per hundredweight offsetting of a 
recent federal milk price support cut of the same size 
if dairy farmers want relief next year they must join other 
farmers in signing up for an abatement program that will pay most 
of their property taxes in exchange for a promise not to sell out 
to developers 
with backers of the growth bill citing sharply rising real 
estate prices as another of developments dangers the legislature 
set aside about a third of this years surplus 20 million for 
the housing and land conservation trust fund 
the fund is designed to help provide affordable housing by 
enabling tenants to buy their apartment complexes and through other 
means it also is to be used to buy development rights on valuable 
open land 
a third part of the growth bill calls for stronger local 
regional and state planning kunin introduced it in her state of 
the state address in january by asking that may be changed to 
shall in several passages of state law on planning 
in the compromise the planning sections will not take effect 
for a year to give time for bugs to be worked out

indian rebels and government officials 
ended six days of talks saturday without reaching the peace 
agreement they had sought for the countrys atlantic coast region 
uriel vanegas an indian military leader said the two sides had 
reached a gentlemans agreement to continue the conversations 
soon 
the hope is in the future he said 
but jose gonzalez one of the government delegates blamed the 
lack of progress on what he said were the unyielding positions of 
brooklyn rivera a leader of yatama the organization of miskito 
sumo and rama indians that met with the government 
the organization which claims to have 2000 guerrillas is not 
allied with the nicaraguan resistance the umbrella group for most 
of the usbacked rebels fighting since 1981 to overthrow the 
sandinista government 
the indian group wants to maintain its traditional tribal 
boundaries elect its own officials and preserve its customs 
during the negotiations rivera maintained his positions on 
boundaries autonomy for the atlantic coast a permanent ceasefire 
and food assistance for 256 indian communities in the region each 
side accused the other of refusing to compromise 
rivera was quoted by local newspapers friday as saying the 
government was requiring a permanent ceasefire as a condition for 
allowing the rebel leaders to visit the coast and called it 
blackmail 
he said the trip was needed to confirm signatures on documents 
by some yatama commanders 
steadman fagoth muller another leader in the rebel delegation 
said any agreement with the government must be based on a 
legitimate genuine and true autonomy that effectively contemplates 
the historic revindications and emancipation of the indian people 
before the talks began rivera said yatama sought the dialogue 
because of a cut in us aid and a hostile attitude by honduras 
which borders nicaragua 
the atlantic coast indians began fighting in 1981 after the 
leftist government tried to impose authority on the isolated 
traditionally independent region

sunday after negotiators failed to reach a tentative agreement on a 
contract settlement 
they did not meet the pattern settlement negotiated with 
goodyear said urw president milan stone after the 1201 am 
sunday deadline stone confirmed the strike was under way 
stone was referring to a tentative agreement reached by the 
urws international committee with goodyear tire amp rubber co the 
union intended for the agreement to serve as a pattern for other 
rubber companies 
stone said firestones latest proposal did not match the pattern 
settlement in the areas of pension costofliving increases and 
health insurance 
these are the three issues that are very dear to our hearts 
and we will fight to keep those and thats why were on strike 
but firestone officials had a different view of the proposal 
we are deeply distressed that the union has taken this 
action george w aucott firestones executive vice president 
said in a statement we believe that our proposal contains a 
number of improvements and in terms of firestones position in the 
industry is equal in value and in cost to the urw settlement

about 125 sikh men left the golden temple 
and surrendered to indian security forces sunday after police 
unleashed a barrage of gunfire on the holy shrine 
one of the militants who surrendered told reporters that between 
40 and 45 sikhs remained holed up in the temple complex which has 
been under siege by india government forces since monday 
the surrender came after the 2800 police and paramilitary 
troops around the shrine fired on the temple for an hour then 
announced a ceasefire at 11 am 1 30 am edt 
using bullhorns they urged the militants to give themselves up 
some militants fired sporadically as the sikhs walked out of the 
besieged temple but no one was injured in the shooting police 
said 
punjab police chief kps gill said some of those who 
surrendered where seen throwing weapons into debris scattered 
inside the temple complex before emerging 
until proof to the contrary everyone will be treated as a 
terrorist or an associate gill said 
security sources who insisted on anonymity said that surjit 
singh penta who is wanted in connection with the shooting deaths 
of more than 30 people in new delhi last year was believed to be 
among those who surrendered 
the united news of india news agency reported that penta was 
hospitalized in critical condition after he apparently took a 
cyanide capsule following his surrender the militants have in the 
past taken poison to escape capture 
at least 30 people most of them sikhs have been killed since 
the siege began monday when sikh separatists inside the temple 
complex opened fire and wounded five officers of the central 
reserve police force 
the golden temple is the spiritual center of sikhism and its 
holiest shrine 
sikhs comprise 2 percent of indias 800 million people but they 
are a majority in punjab state and are fighting for an independent 
punjab homeland 
the radicals have killed about 960 people so far this year in 
punjab compared with 1030 for all of 1987 the victims include 
moderate sikhs as well as hindus

about 1200 soviet troops lumbered 
into kabul in tanks and armored personnel carriers sunday in the 
first troop movement of the retreat from the afghan war 
after a daylong ride through guerrillainfested mountains the 
soldiers in the 300vehicle convoy were greeted by cheering afghans 
who lined the streets of kabul turning the military movement into 
a parade afghan president najib was on hand to review the 
departing troops 
the convoy had pulled up stakes in jalalabad early sunday and 
covered the 88mile distance to the capital by evening 
the convoy had pulled up stakes in jalalabad in eastern 
afghanistan early sunday and covered the 60mile distance to the 
capital by evening 
soviet col alexander zubrilin told reporters that there had 
been no casualties during the trek through among the rough terrain 
that is within the reach of usbacked rebels fighting najibs 
communist government 
information about the start of the withdrawal was provided by a 
reuters news agency pool report the associated press was barred 
from covering the event and soviet officials said the exclusion 
was the result of questions asked by the ap during a previous trip 
to kabul 
edmund mcwilliams deputy chiefofmission at the us embassy 
in kabul told the associated press by telephone that the rebels 
have moved in closer to the capital and stepped up attacks on the 
city 
weve had as you may know this past week quite a bit of 
rocketing of the city and were expecting possibly some more 
rocketing tonight mcwilliams said it does not appear though 
at this point that the attacks will be affecting the pullout 
the jalalabad convoy was to head north on monday along the route 
that passes through the salang tunnel under the hindu kush 
mountains to the border with soviet uzbekistan 
about 115000 soviet troops are in afghanistan to bolster 
najibs forces but all must pull back to soviet territory within 
the next nine months to comply with unmediated peace accords 
signed in geneva last month 
half of the troops must leave by aug 15 under the agreement 
lt gen boris gromov told reporters saturday that about one 
quarter of the soldiers would be home before president reagan 
visits moscow on may 29 
the communist party leadership in moscow headed by mikhail s 
gorbachev addressed the departing troops with words of thanks and a 
call for the ir help in improving soviet life once they are back on 
native ground 
days of severe trials lie behind you said the party central 
committee address printed on the front page of the party daily 
pravda your profound faith in the noble cause of assistance to 
the friendly people braced you up in those trials you have 
fulfilled the order of your homeland 
after stating that those killed in afghanistan would never be 
forgotten pravda turned to the soldiers tasks for the future 
your energy is needed today for perestroika for the cause of 
renovating socialism for the protection of its achievements the 
address continued the party believes in you and calls you into 
the forefront of the drive for revolutionary transformations of 
soviet society 
perestroika or rebuilding is gorbachevs drive to shape the 
nation into a more democratic and economically viable society 
the official tass news agency announced early sunday that the 
pullout had begun from jalalabad with the departure of a motorized 
rifle regiment 
tass also reported that najib sent a message of thanks to 
gorbachev on sunday praising the heroic feat of the soviets in 
helping defe nd his government 
in a joint sovietafghan statement carried by tass the allied 
governments said the pivotal issue in ending the civil war that 
has gripped afghanistan for a decade would be ensuring an end to 
interference from the outside in the home affairs of the 
afghans 
soviet and afghan officials have accused the united states and 
pakistan of exacerbating the war by delivering arms to the rebels 
it was not clear whether other soviet units also left their 
bases on sunday or when the first troops would cross the border 
into the soviet union 
soviet troops and tanks moved into afghanistan on dec 27 1979

the federal reserve which ratcheted interest 
rates up a notch last week is standing ready to tighten further if 
inflation shows signs of getting out of control economists believe 
the central banks credit tightening moves have already prompted 
the first increase in the prime rate in seven months and economists 
said they look for a variety of interest rates including mortgage 
rates to head higher in the weeks ahead 
fed policymakers will meet behind closed doors tuesday to 
review current monetary policy economists said this session of the 
federal open market committee has already been overshadowed by the 
move the central bank took last week to boost interest rates 
while the fed as usual made no public announcement of the 
action the closely watched federal funds rate moved up onefourth 
of a percentage point to 7 percent last week this rate which is 
the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans is the 
most sensitive to moves by the central bank to make cash more or 
less readily available to the banking system 
major banks followed suit announcing wednesday a boost in their 
prime lending rate from 85 percent to 9 percent the first 
increase in this benchmark lending rate since the stock market 
crash jolted wall street 
the prime rate is used to calculate loans to businesses as well 
as to determine many types of consumer loans including the popular 
home equity loans 
the credit tightening by the fed followed a report that the 
unemployment rate had fallen to a 14year low of 54 percent in 
april it was the second move by the central bank in less than two 
months to tighten up on credit conditions as a way of dampening 
economic activity to prevent a surge in inflation 
the fed had also been tightening credit right before the october 
stock market crash but switched quickly to an easiermoney policy 
to keep the country from slipping into a recession 
but reports so far this year indicate that the economy suffered 
few ill effects from the crash the overall economy grew at a 
surprisingly robust 23 percent annual rate from january through 
march 
many analysts believe the current jobless level means the 
country is nearing the range of full employment when tight labor 
markets can start pushing up wages 
allen sinai chief economist for the boston co said he 
believes a variety of signs shows the country is on the brink of a 
round of higher inflation in which too many dollars are chasing 
too few goods 
we have a strong economy pressing against capacity in both the 
labor and production markets he said but it is early in the 
process which suggests that there is perhaps still time for the 
fed to nip it in the bud 
other economists are not so sure that inflationary pressures 
have begun to build they note that wage demands have still 
remained moderate and industry is operating at 823 percent of 
capacity still below the 85 percent range thought to trigger 
inflation problems 
but analysts generally agreed that interest rates are headed 
higher pushed up not only by credit tightening by the central bank 
but concern among banks and financial market investors that they 
need to demand a higher premium as a hedge against inflation 
mortgage rates have been rising in recent weeks and now stand at 
104 percent for a fixedrate 30year mortgage up from 982 
percent just two months ago 
david wyss an economist with data resources inc predicted 
that mortgage rates would hit 1075 percent by midsummer 
inflation is accelerating he said no one knows for sure 
where full employment is but almost everybody would agree that 54 
percent is getting close 
michael evans head of a washington forecasting firm said he 
expected the central bank would like to keep policy unchanged to 
avoid drawing attention to its actions during a presidential 
campaign but he said renewed pressure on the dollar would force 
the central bank to tighten further 
the fed tightened slightly a month ago when an unexpectedly high 
us trade deficit sent the dollar tumbling on foreign currency 
markets the government is due to report the march trade report on 
tuesday 
if a bad trade report sends the dollar down the fed would 
have to send another signal to the markets that it will defend the 
us currency evans said

the monkeys at paignton zoological and botanical 
gardens are soon to get new improved housing thanks to a 750000 
bequest from a woman who loved their company 
for decades elderly women have been leaving their fortunes to 
animal charities like the cats protection league the donkey 
sanctuary or zoos like paignton in southwest england 
this week the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to 
animals received the largest gift in its 164year history 515 
million from an 80yearold widow who lived with her cat pussy 
even in a nation of pet owners charities say such women shine 
feeling alone in the world except for their pets elderly women 
are the lifeblood of britains multimilliondollar animal charities 
animal charities are on the crest of a demographic boom 
says jonathan clark appeals officer for 91yearold pet charity 
blue cross which in 1986 received more than half its 465 million 
of income from bequests 
most of our supporters are of a generation whose husbands or 
potential husbands went off to two world wars and never came back 
the last thing in their lives was a cat or a dog and theyve got 
no one to leave everything to he said 
women usually live longer than men says paul wright legacy 
officer for the peoples dispensary for sick animals founded in 
1917 to treat poor peoples pets very often they are simply left 
with an animal 
often the only condition is that the charity care for their 
cat dog even chicken the rspca has received 20 cats this year 
and the dispensary was left money to subsidize a tortoise in what 
wright chuckles will be a longterm arrangement given their 
lifespans 
the most spectacular bequests usually fall to the rspca 
britains 10th largest charity and the countrys largest 
animalsonly cause last year it depended on posthumous gifts for 
nearly 70 percent of its 342 million income 
without that source we wouldnt be able to function said 
spokeswoman amanda aviss 
in 1985 its secondlargest windfall came from an elderly woman 
who gave 245 million provided it was spent on the societys 240 
inspectors who investigate cases of cruelty 
dorothy walkers bequest to the rspca was unconditional and did 
not even mention pussy whom the society is resettling 
she often said she preferred animals to people and she was 
determined to prove it to the last londons today newspaper 
quoted mrs walkers former housekeeper as saying 
ivy warr an elderly woman who said she was mrs walkers 
sister said she was shocked and disgusted by the will but 
couldnt afford to contest 
with large bequests youll often find relatives pop up and 
try to get the money acknowledges ms aviss saying the society 
can only abide by the law 
but most benefactors dont hate people charities say 
clark says he sometimes receives a letter saying ive lost 
faith in human nature all my money can go to the animals 
many elderly women have ample estates because the value of their 
house has skyrocketed over the years charities say 
some charities worry about depending on bequest while human 
causes also depend on them most have far fewer bequests in 
proportion to their total income 
you need good live donators says elizabeth svendsen whose 
donkey sanctuary depends on legacies for more than half its 
voluntary income 
i love the legacies but i think its a healthy sign to have 
other donors she says 
still some animal lovers bypass charities leaving money to 
their own animals or to those they call their own 
marie lefevre an 84yearold widow who died two years ago left 
754000 to the apes she visited regularly for 20 years at paignton 
mary rosevear a zoo official said the money is expected this 
fall and will be used to build new ape houses and refurbish others 
she spelled out what she wanted said mrs rosevear

the government calls it zero tolerance 
but industry and civil liberties groups have begun to question 
whether overkill isnt an equally accurate description of the 
policy under which luxury yachts and other private property is 
being seized in the battle against drugs 
in the latest episode the us coast guard confiscated on 
saturay the yacht monkey business the charter vessel that once 
ferried presidential contender gary hart and model donna rice to 
the bahamas after officers said they found 1 gram or one 
twentyeighth of an ounce of marijuana aboard 
only days earlier the coast guard seized the 25 million 
yacht ark royal on grounds that onetenth of an ounce of 
marijuana was aboard no one was arrested in either case 
even rental cars and leased boats and trucks are being seized by 
us customs service agents and the coast guard triggering 
complaints from owners who argue that they shouldnt be penalized 
for the acts of their customers 
richard schwartz president of the boat owners association of 
the united states personally protested to the commandant of the 
coast guard that the seizure of the 25 million yacht ark royal 
was overkill 
the association which has 265000 members estimates that there 
are 15 million boat owners across the country 
were concerned about the drug problem in america but there 
has to be a rule of reasonableness here michael sciulla the 
associations vice president said friday 
in the case of the ark royal the owner of the boat was not on 
board no one was arrested as far as we can tell there were no 
large amounts of drugs found on the boat sciulla said it just 
doesnt seem fair that the absent owner would face forfeiture on 
those grounds 
three days after the controversial yacht seizure the coast 
guard released the ark royal when the irvine calif owner of the 
133foot yacht paid a 1000 fine and 600 in seizure fees some 
marijuana seeds and two stems had been found in a dresser drawer 
and a trash can aboard the boat 
this type of action presents an unreasonable danger to all 
boat owners for the isolated actions of passengers and crew said 
michael rogerson president of tomima corp the ark royals owner 
the government shows no signs of backing away from its new 
policy last week the coast guard seized another yacht off the 
florida coast after a search turned up a dollar bill with traces of 
cocaine and a bag with marijuana residue it also seized a 55foot 
fishing boat off san diego after finding less than an ounce of 
marijuana and a small amount of what appeared to be methamphetamine 
since april 11 the coast guard has confiscated 27 boats under 
the zero tolerance campaign the customs service is stepping up 
its program and since march 21 agents have seized 700 vehicles 
containing drugs 
they are not deterring bad guys but they are punishing the 
innocent guy with a program in which a number of rental vehicles 
are being seized and held for lengthy periods said alan kay 
outside general counsel to the the american car rental association 
one of the problems with seizure is that under any 
circumstances it takes sometimes eight or nine months for the 
return of the vehicle to a rental agency which pays storage 
costs to get it back kay said 
mary coombs a miami representative of the american civil 
liberties union agrees that it is excessive to take somebodys 
property from them for something they probably couldnt control 
its putting people at enormous risk with no very effective way 
of protecting themselves 
the term zero tolerance originated last year when us 
attorney peter nunez of san diego calif and us customs service 
agents began arresting motorists carrying even tiny amounts of 
drugs across the border the customs agents and nunez were 
embarking on an effort that has become a model for the federal 
governments current war on drug users 
under the san diego operation an average of 15 people a week 
are charged with drug possession many of whom are firsttime 
offenders who wind up on probation for one year 
i encourage federal prosecutors nationwide to emulate the 
program in san diego with all available prosecution resources 
attorney general edwin meese iii said in a march 30 memo to all 
us attorneys 
meese noted that the antidrug abuse act of 1986 includes a 
1000 mandatory minimum fine for possession and that federal civil 
asset forfeiture provisions permit law enforcement officers to 
confiscate any vehicle carrying drugs even in trace amounts 
when used judiciously meese said in the memo these 
sanctions send present and potential users a clear signal about the 
unacceptability of drug use 
the reagan administrations view is that possession is a very 
serious thing and that its the possession of the drug which needs 
to be dealt with if were ever going to address with the drug 
problem in a serious way said justice department spokesman terry 
eastland what puts bite into our entire user prosecution 
initiative is this forfeiture aspect 
drug traffickers frequently are the target of asset forfeiture 
proceedings while users seldom have been but under federal law on 
civil asset forfeiture there is no distinction between the 
property of drug users and drug traffickers forfeiture does not 
depend on the quantity of drugs involved nor is it a legal defense 
under the forfeiture law to claim that the contraband was intended 
for personal use rather than commercial trafficking 
meese noted in his march 30 memo that our primary narcotics 
enforcement focus at the federal level has been and will continue 
to be on supply reduction 
but it is becoming increasingly apparent that a more 
consistent enforcement presence on the demand side is vital to the 
success of our national antidrug program meese said in the memo

one week after voters swept socialist president 
francois mitterrand to a second sevenyear term they face yet more 
campaign pledges political decisions and two new rounds of voting 
mitterrands announcement saturday that he had decided to 
dissolve the 577seat national assembly and hold elections june 5 
and june 12 set off a flurry of justifications denunciations and 
scrambling for unity among conservative parties 
socialist leaders called the move inevitable to conservatives 
it was proof that mitterrand had bamboozled voters with campaign 
vows to form a centerleft government of national unity 
mr francois mitterrand has just demonstrated that the 
position he himself had defined on this subject during the 
presidential campaign was only aimed at putting the french 
people to sleep said jeanclaude gaudin he leads the outgoing 
assembly contingent of the centerright union for french democracy 
one of two leading rightist parties that hope to defeat the 
socialists in the upcoming elections 
after campaigning on the theme of national unity and pledging to 
try to work with the existing assembly and its threeseat 
centerright majority mitterrand changed his mind he said he 
would seek a new assembly to try to win a majority of his own 
the outgoing assembly was controlled by former premier jacques 
chiracs conservative rally for the republic party and the union 
for french democracy mitterrand won 54 percent of the vote in the 
may 8 presidential runoff against chirac 
the president named michel rocard a popular socialist with wide 
appeal to the center of the political spectrum as his new premier 
but rocard was unable to find more than token nonsocialist 
representation for his government 
mr mitterrand ceded to double pressure that of the socialist 
party which dreams of regaining an absolute majority in the 
national assembly and that of michel rocard who did not have the 
courage to present himself before parliament said gaudin 
in his nationally televised address saturday night the 
president said the opening to the center he had sought could not 
be brought about to the extent i wished therefore it was my duty 
to draw the appropriate conclusions 
pierre mehaignerie a centrist political leader who represented 
a key to any alliance with the socialists said he was firmly 
opposed to a governing agreement with the socialists but he also 
opposed the dissolution 
the centrists had said they would not automatically submit a 
censure motion against a rocard government but would instead judge 
each socialist bill on its merits 
jeanmarie le pen leader of the extreme right national front 
called the new elections a socialist ambush le pen who scored 
a surprisingly high 14 percent in the first round of the 
presidential election proposed a united front against the 
hegemony of the socialist party 
however jacques toubon secretarygeneral of the rally for the 
republic rejected that idea he called for his party to join the 
union for french democracy and present single candidates in each 
district to strengthen their possibilities 
the official campaign for the first round of voting opens may 22 
and closes june 3 
according to an opinion poll published sunday in the journal du 
dimanche socialists would win 41 percent of the vote 24 percent 
would go to the rally and 15 percent to the union the rest would 
go to minor parties

a chinese airline official demanded that taiwan 
severely punish two men who were granted political asylum after 
they hijacked a chinese jet to taiwan an official report said 
sunday 
however wu rongnan director general of xiamen aviation co 
which operated the plane did not comment on taiwans refusal to 
return the hijackers to china as communist authorities had 
requested 
the two men former air force radar operators hijacked a boeing 
737 with 118 people on board thursday night and forced it to fly to 
taiwan threatening the crew with what later turned out to be a toy 
gun and fake explosives 
taiwan governed since 1949 by the anticommunist nationalist 
party returned the plane crew and other passengers within hours 
it gave the hijackers asylum but the taiwan military has 
recommended they be prosecuted for endangering flight safety 
the peoples daily on sunday quoted wu as telling a news 
conference in coastal xiamen where the hijacked flight originated 
that the hijackers use of force warranted severe punishment 
without regard to the safety of the chinese and foreign 
passengers the two hijackers used force to threaten the planes 
crew and passengers and caused the plane to exceed its speed limit 
triggering violent shaking of the plane body the newspaper 
quoted him as saying 
in order to protect the safety of the plane and passengers 
the pilot had no choice but to fly as the hijackers directed he 
was quoted as saying 
accounts in chinas official media have said the hijackers 
zhang qingguo 27 and long guiyun 26 covered the heads of 
several crew members with plastic bags and wrapped two stewardesses 
in cotton curtains to stop them from signaling for help 
the pilot yang yongling said the hijackers told him they had 
guns and knives 
the peoples daily said in view of the hijackers violent 
actions wu demanded the taiwanese side severely punish the two 
hijackers according to aviation practice 
taiwan military officials have refused comment on whether zhang 
and long will be charged with hijacking 
if charged and convicted of the lesser crime of endangering 
flight safety they could receive a maximum of seven years in jail 
however the presiding judge of the court in taiwans capital 
taipei said the hijackers could expect leniency 
taiwan officials are torn between their desire to avoid 
appearing to encourage hijacking and their sympathy for the 
hijackers motives zhang said they acted because they detested 
the brutality of communism 
while the hijacking was in progress the civil aviation 
administration of china parent company of the xiamen aviation co 
asked taiwan to return the hijackers china has not repeated this 
request or commented on taiwans refusal to comply 
in 1986 when the pilot of a taiwan airliner diverted his plane 
to canton and defected to china mainland officials returned the 
plane and crew but not the pilot and did not charge him 
that incident led to the first direct talks between mainland and 
taiwan officials since 1949

just two years ago the congressional budget 
offices economic forecasts ruled capitol hill and its decisions 
could force the president to cut billions of dollars in federal 
spending 
but the congress has stripped the office of important powers 
left it without a permanent director for more than a year and 
exposed the officially nonpartisan agency to charges of political 
tampering 
cbo is disintegrating said rep william h gray iii dpa 
chairman of the house budget committee 
congress set up its own budget office a dozen years ago to 
counter the power of the presidents office of management and 
budget in the following decade the agency established a 
reputation for nonbiased and unvarnished assessments of the 
federal budget and its workings in the economy 
in december 1985 its power peaked with passage of the emergency 
deficit reduction amendment known as grammrudman the cbo was 
charged with making deficit estimates that once averaged with 
white house figures launched automatic spending cuts across the 
government 
in 1986 however the supreme court found the law defective in 
rewriting the statute congress relegated the cbo to advisory 
status 
a housesenate search committee meantime was unable to agree 
on a replacement for cbo director rudolph g penner whose 
threeyear term was expiring at years end penner stayed on until 
march 1987 
the two sides appear farther apart than ever over choosing a 
successor although there are many qualified candidates each 
chamber is fighting for its own choice 
personal honor is at stake said one house aide involved in 
the process who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
rep leon panetta dcalif who is expected to take over the 
budget committee next year said he was concerned congress was 
ceding back to the executive branch the economic decisionmaking 
prowess it has fought to gain 
i think congress has to be very concerned when it begins to 
lose what has been an objective eye in dealing with budget 
issues he said without an officiallyappointed leader to carry 
the flag the agency is an easier target for those who dont like 
cbos opinions he said 
the agency is already embroiled in a dispute between house 
republicans and democrats over a bill raising the federal minimum 
wage and it has been criticized by both sides 
the democraticcontrolled house education and labor committee 
asked the cbo for an official estimate of the bills cost to the 
federal and local governments republicans opponents meanwhile 
requested a broader assessment including effects on the nations 
economy 
the cbo at first answered both requests in its report to the 
committee but the democrats ordered the cbo to delete the 
nationwide assessment which concluded that 500000 jobs would be 
lost 
republicans charged partisan tampering while the democrats 
accused the cbo of failing to follow strictly the committee request 
we were being used as a pawn to fight the minimum wage 
legislation said jim blum the acting director of the agency 
i am very much concerned about what appears to be a growing 
perception that were losing our nonpartisanship 
sen pete v domenici of new mexico senior republican on the 
senate budget committee said he was beginning to become concerned 
also he has suggested that blum interim director since the 
beginning of this year be made the permanent director 
there must be a leader at cbo to maintain its credibility 
agreed gray but the house leadership has favored other candidates 
with neither chamber giving ground in whose prerogative it is to 
choose the director some of those involved expect the decision 
will be postponed until next year both the house and senate will 
have new budget committee chairman then but panetta the future 
house chairman said waiting could hurt 
every day that we dont have a director there at cbo makes 
it that much tougher for whoevers appointed to restore its 
credibility he said

the parliament on sunday approved 
economic reforms to freeze wages and open yugoslavia to world 
markets a day after the countrys two most westernized republics 
tried to topple the government 
both chambers of parliament backed the reforms which premier 
branko mikulic worked out with the international monetary fund 
mikulic outlined the economic reforms in general terms on 
saturday when he survived calls for his governments ouster from 
slovenia and croatia yugoslavia will curb its import restrictions 
open itself to world markets and give its national bank a stronger 
monetary role he said 
mikulic also talked of allowing citizens to buy stock in firms 
and of increasing the role of profit in production 
he said the new measures would be harsh but warned that more 
drastic reductions in real wages lay ahead if inflation exceeded 
the 90 percent target yugoslavias current inflation rate is 170 
percent and it has a foreign debt of 20 billion 
slovenia and croatia the most advanced of yugoslavias six 
republics blame mikulics government for the nations economic 
crisis and urged a vote of noconfidence in the government 
parliament on saturday decided against voting on the motion 
during saturdays discussion closed to the public but reported 
in detail by the staterun media even mikulics supporters noted 
the government had failed to master the economic crisis 
the governments failure has eroded support for the communist 
party which has governed this nation since world war ii 
serbian intellectuals and slovenians have even begun calling 
openly for a multiparty western democracy 
mikulic blamed what he termed the antiquity lack of 
flexibility and inefficiency of the current economic system for 
the crisis but rejected any immediate need for political reform 
yugoslavias six constituent republics and two autonomous 
provinces are currently battling over how to reform the countrys 
awkward 1974 constitution bequeathed by the late josip broz tito 
in what he said was an attempt to avoid ethnic conflict 
mikulic said saturday he wanted the constitutional reform pushed 
through by early fall 
the constitution has proved unworkable because of its 
requirement that each republic and province approve all key 
political decisions and because of its mandatory annual rotation of 
all state and communist party offices 
the ritual of rotating the presidency took place on sunday with 
former foreign minister raif dizdarevic a bosnian taking over 
from lazar mojsov a macedonian 
yugoslavia is hoping to get 2 billion of debt payments 
rescheduled and to receive another 14 billion from the imf later 
this month 
agreement with the imf had been expected last week but the fund 
apparently delayed approval pending this weekends confidence vote 
on the mikulic government 
yugoslavia is also expected to secure 300 million in bridging 
loans needed to stave off bankruptcy before the imf accord takes 
effect 
failure to secure the emergency loans last week led mikulics 
government to delay the lifting of a sixmonth wage and price 
freeze imposed last november 
yugoslavs have been on a mass shopping spree in anticipation 
that prices will jump sharply higher after lifting of the ban 
which only partially limited inflation 
living standards which have already fallen by onethird since 
1980 are expected to drop further making strikes and social 
unrest likely 
the gap between the poor south and richer north of yugoslavia is 
also likely to increase provoking more calls from wealthy slovenia 
and croatia for a marketoriented economy with closer ties to 
western europe

government scientists will take to the sea and 
air in july to measure the chemicals contributing to acid rain off 
the midatlantic coast 
a research ship and aircraft will study chemicals in the air and 
water between norfolk va and bermuda the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration announced 
dr joe boatman of the noaa air resources laboratory in boulder 
colo said that the scientists will measure concentrations of 
sulfur nitrogen and other chemicals in an effort to track 
pollution as it travels off the coast 
acidic rain believed to result from the chemical reaction 
between water in the air and chemical pollution from factories has 
been blamed for environmental damage in the northeast and canada 
among other areas 
in addition the environmental defense fund recently charged 
that this acid precipitation could be partly to blame for declines 
in marine life in coastal areas including the chesapeake and 
delaware bays and long island and pamlico sounds 
boatman said the noaa ship mt mitchell and an agency aircraft 
will make several trips between bermuda and the east coast to 
measure the chemicals determine their direction of travel and 
predict how much reaches bermuda and beyond

the government declared a state of 
emergency in the wartorn northern provinces of eritrea and tigre 
and ordered border areas evacuated government radio reported 
sunday 
western diplomats said the action raised fears that president 
mengistu haile mariams communist government will use harsh tactics 
to suppress marxist separatists in the north where the war has 
made it difficult to get relief supplies to 32 million drought 
victims 
addis ababa radio said the decree issued saturday gave 
security forces and administrators sweeping powers to fight the 
eritrean and tigrean rebels in this east african nation 
it said people and their property will be evacuated within 15 
days from 6milewide strips along ethiopias 1500mile border 
with sudan and along the 600mile red sea coastline excluding the 
eritrean port of massawa 
the report did not indicate how many people would be affected 
but the areas are sparsely populated 
the decree issued by the council of state and signed by 
mengistu establishes military and security councils to direct all 
military and civilian activities and empowers them to transfer or 
expel people and sequester private property for public service 
western diplomats said they were particularly concerned about a 
section of the decree giving the councils power to declare any area 
prohibited 
it smacks of freefire zones presumably the intention is 
to say you get out of the area and if not youre dead meat said 
one western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity 
president reagan said last month that starvation and scorched 
earth are being considered as weapons to defeat the rebellion 
rebels of the secessionist eritrean peoples liberation front 
have been fighting for 27 years in africas oldest civil war and 
guerrillas of the tigre peoples liberation front took up arms 14 
years ago to demand more autonomy they have won major victories 
this year and captured several towns since february 
mengistu on march 31 said his government is starting a huge 
counteroffensive in his first acknowledgment of the war mengistu 
said his troops were fighting a grim struggle against rebels in 
the countrys northernmost provinces 
a week later his government expelled from eritrea and tigre 
about 60 foreign relief workers citing personnel risks 
the action has crippled a massive western relief operation 
government officials have said indigenous organizations will 
continue relief efforts but insist that military objectives must 
take priority over humanitarian needs 
in congress last month chester crocker us assistant 
secretary of state accused mengistu of banning relief workers to 
hide the fighting 
he doesnt want anyone to see whats going on up there 
because its going to be bloody crocker told the africa and 
human rights subcommittees of the house foreign affairs committee 
mengistu inherited the insurgencies in 1974 when with a clique 
of fellow army officers he helped overthrow emperor haile selassie

sinhalese extremists sunday shot and 
killed five people in a raid on the home of an official in 
president junius r jayewardenes governing united national party 
military officers who briefed reporters on condition of 
anonymity said the extremists attacked the home of b abeywickrene 
in the town of akuressa 80 miles south of colombo 
abeywickrene secretary to the districts chief minister was 
not home at the time the officers said 
the victims were two police constables a bodyguard assigned to 
abeywickrene and two civilians the officers said 
on saturday the extremists shot to death serasinghe nandapala 
a candidate from jayewardenes party in upcoming local council 
elections police said 
both attacks were blamed on the peoples liberation front made 
up of extremists from the ethnic sinhalese majority opposed to 
making concessions to the minority tamils 
the government announced tuesday that it signed an accord with 
the front to end its bloody attacks which have taken the lives of 
more than 260 politicians and government officials since last july 
but on wednesday the underground leader of the group denounced the 
pact and said he had not signed it 
the front has vowed to kill anyone who supports the 
indianbrokered peace accord signed last july 29 and aimed at 
ending a fiveyear tamil separatist war 
tamils who are mostly hindus make up 18 percent of sri lankas 
16 million population they say they are discriminated against by 
the sinhalese buddhists who control the government and military 
sinhalese make up about 75 percent of the population the rest 
are christian descendants of colonial settlers and moslem 
descendants of early arab traders 
india has sent more than 50000 troops to the island to try to 
enforce the accord most of the troops are in the north and east 
where the liberation tigers of tamil eelam militia has continued 
its insurgency despite the peace pact 
india is involved because it is a regional power and because it 
has 60 million ethnic tamils in its southern states who are 
sympathetic to their sri lankan brethren

while others lands desperately fight 
overpopulation mainly roman catholic quebec is trying to ignite a 
new baby boom to safeguard the continents only frenchspeaking 
society 
a generation ago quebec had the highest birthrate in the free 
world it was common for frenchspeaking couples in the province to 
have five or more children 
however in a dramatic shift to fastpaced urban life quebecers 
now have one of the lowest rates in the west down from an average 
of 45 children to just 14 
concerned that any decline in its 66 million population will 
eventually doom the continents only french society the government 
has announced a package of incentives to encourage a new baby boom 
to begin with the province will hand out 405 for a couples 
first child and 405 for a second child for a third child and each 
subsequent child parents will get 2430 in quarterly installments 
over two years 
the bonuses apply to both married and single parents 
premier robert bourassas liberal government has promised 60000 
new day care spaces over the next seven years no more taxes on 
family allowances and an interestfree loan of 5670 to help 
families with two or more children buy their first home 
if all that doesnt work there could be more bourassa said in 
an interview well see in the next budget he said 
as the leader of the only frenchspeaking organized society in 
north america i have a responsibility weve had a spectacular 
decline in demography 
the aim is to boost the birth rate to 18 in the next five years 
france guerette and her husband pierre blouin new parents of 
quadruplets were among the first couples to reap the benefits of 
last weeks handout with six children in all they will get 9720 
in bonuses alone 
we are so very happy it will certainly help said guerette 
but some people doubt the policy can reverse a trend that began 
with quebecs socalled quiet revolution in the 1960s a cultural 
awakening led by the urbanbased liberal party that spawned 
economic reforms and a new emphasis on education church influence 
declined as young people left rural areas for the cities 
power shifted from the english minority to the 81percent french 
majority during the 1970s a tumultuous decade of separatist 
sentiment that subsided when voters rejected a sovereignty 
referendum in 1980 
since then quebecers have focused on improved living standards 
and competitiveness the province boasted 5 percent real growth 
last year and produced 40 percent of canadas business 
administration students 
in one generation quebec women became the biggest consumers 
of the pill said montreal mayor jean dore who says the island 
core of his city has 19 million inhabitants but could sustain 35 
million 
quebec was also the first canadian province to permit abortion 
on demand 
sociologist morton weinfeld of montreals mcgill university 
warned that the handouts could backfire by creating more 
welfaredependent poor children while failing to encourage upwardly 
mobile couples to have babies 
then the problem is that society is going to have to provide 
adequate social services and education to give these children an 
equal opportunity weinfeld said 
indeed montrealers fred and sylvie bush who earn 60750 a 
year between them and just bought a new house said the baby boom 
policy wont influence them 
were not going to start making babies tomorrow said bush 
30 we want to keep our lifestyle his wife added 
university of montreal demographer jacques henripin suggested 
longer paid maternity leave and better parttime job opportunities 
as the longterm solution nobody is going to have a child just 
to get 405 he said 
the government has one other tool to boost population growth 
quebec will welcome 27000 immigrants this year and is eager to 
take more provided they remain in the province and educate their 
children in french

about 125 men most of them sikh 
extremists surrendered to police sunday after indian security 
forces fired hundreds of rounds from machine guns and automatic 
rifles into the besieged golden temple complex 
punjab police chief kps gill said 40 to 50 sikh extremists 
were still holed up in the temple sikhisms holiest shrine 
police said 18 women and eight children all believed to be 
relatives of the militants also walked from the temple compound 
which has been surrounded for a week by 2800 security forces 
among those who surrendered was surjit singh penta 24 a 
fugitive wanted for killing more than 150 people including 30 in 
attacks in new delhi last year 
police said that when recognized by security officers penta 
asked for a glass of water and used it to down poison he died 
later at a local hospital 
gill said police prevented pentas brother harcharan singh 
from similarly committing suicide pentas wife and their 
5yearold son were among the women and children who surrendered 
police said 
sikh radicals who launched their guerrilla campaign for a 
separate homeland in 1982 have been blamed for killing more than 
960 people in punjab state since the start of the year they 
allegedly killed more than 1030 last year 
a government official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
sunday that the golden temples jailed head priest jasbir singh 
rode has been asked to urge the remaining militants to surrender 
rode and three of the other four high priests were jailed 
thursday after they attempted to lead a procession to the golden 
temple to restore their authority and resume religious rites rode 
was out of the temple may 9 when the confrontation began 
four bodies were carried out of the temple sunday raising to at 
least 35 the number of people who have died since the siege began 
all but five of the victims are believed to be militants 
the police chief said some of the men who surrendered where seen 
throwing weapons into debris scattered inside the temple complex 
before emerging 
till proof to the contrary everyone will be treated as a 
terrorist or an associate gill said 
earlier sunday security forces fired incendiary shells at the 
clock tower overlooking the northern entrance to the complex and 
set the tower ablaze 
black smoke billowed from the 50foot tower over the north 
entrance to the temple complex after police hit it with a barrage 
of bullets about 930 am 
despite the fire militants later went back into the tower and 
fired on the police cordon the militants also remained in control 
of at least one interior tower near the center of the complex 
the siege on the temple was launched may 9 after militants 
inside opened fire on a group of security force commanders who were 
making an inspection outside the temple five people were injured 
about 800 people most of them sikh pilgrims were evacuated 
from the temple complex last tuesday a handful of sikh men crept 
out of the complex saturday night and surrendered police said 
sunday 
on saturday ss ray the federally appointed governor of 
punjab state issued what he termed a last warning to the 
militants to surrender 
if the terrorists refuse to see reason then no one should 
blame us for our action he said in a statement from the state 
capital at chandigarh 
ray did not give any deadline for the surrender 
the government is hesitant to enter the shrine because it

the late cia director william j casey 
successfully maneuvered to weaken white house oversight of us 
foreign intelligence operations while the irancontra affair was 
taking shape according to a book by a former aide to president 
reagan 
the book revolution by martin anderson published by 
harcourt brace jovanovich also says that former white house chief 
of staff donald t regan abetted casey in his move although he was 
uneasy about it 
anderson who was reagans chief domestic policy adviser during 
part of his first term and became a member of the presidents 
foreign intelligence advisory board in his second term describes 
steps leading up to a reorganization of the board in november 1985 
the board originally 21 members was reduced to 14 by firing 11 
members and adding four new ones making it what anderson called a 
celebrity board 
when the 21memberstrong pfiab that used to probe widely and 
deeply without caution was transformed into a much smaller board 
dominated by famous very busy people one of the last effective 
potential checks on casey and the intelligence community was 
gone anderson wrote 
it is impossible to say for certain that if the old pfiab was 
in place the irancontra affair would not have happened he said 
but a large vigorous board would have made it more likely that 
the skullduggery would have been discovered much much earlier 
according to andersons account the initial complaints about 
the boards size came from anne armstrong its chairman he wrote 
that casey however did not like the old pfiab and 
graciously allowed mrs armstrong to be his stalking horse 
he wrote in the book that robert c mcfarlane then the 
presidents national security adviser supported casey and mrs 
armstrong although he later told anderson in an interview that he 
regretted this 
mcfarlane had an aide kenneth de graffenreid draft a letter 
reorganizing the board which was sent to the president for his 
consideration and signature bypassing regan 
reagan telephoned his chief of staff according to an account 
that regan gave anderson in an interview and said don why are 
we firing all of these people 
regan caught by surprise called mrs armstrong who told him 
the board was so large it was unwieldy 
regan still felt uneasy wrote anderson this was not 
something he wanted responsibility for 
so he arranged a meeting for mrs armstrong to make the case 
directly to the president 
reagan approved the firings which were announced on nov 4 
1985

two conservation groups are involved in a 
project to help the poor in the himalayan mountain kingdom of 
nepal while at the same time protecting the birds and the beasts 
there 
as part of the project the groups have encouraged the nepalese 
to sell kerosene to the thousands of americans and mountain lovers 
from other lands who trek to annapurna in nepal and use up wood on 
the mountainside the nepalese also are getting training in growing 
vegetables running lodges and developing hot springs for the 
mountain visitors 
william k reilly president of the us branch of the world 
wildlife fund and the affiliated conservation foundation announced 
the project last week at a news conference 
it is similar to more than 20 projects that have been started 
over the past two years from mexico to thailand with a grant from 
the agency for international development aid the conservation 
groups have held off publicizing them until they could report some 
success 
annapurna is one of the worlds highest most fragile and most 
beautiful areas it also is also one of the worlds poorest areas 
the average citizen of nepal earns about 160 dollars a year 
less than 1 percent of the average us income 
it is poverty that causes degradation of the environment more 
than anything else reilly said 
russell e train chairman of their joint board of directors 
said the program has had a modest success and is on the right track 
it has taken first steps but they are important satisfying 
first steps he said 
the projects still have plenty of problems 
the groups expect to cooperate with the world bank the major 
international source of aid which lends about 17 billion a year 
to raise living standards in the third world 
in recent months it has greatly enlarged its staff that deals 
with the environment and paid increasing attention to environmental 
issues after much prodding from the us government and private 
environmental organizations 
it is owned by 151 countries with the united states the biggest 
stockholder 
reilly said he thought the bank with its new interest in the 
environment and the conservationists with new interest in people 
are moving toward one another 
thats fine as long as they dont forget to drop some money 
as they go by us he added

pope john paul iis scheduled visit to 
paraguay has magnified a split between the 34yearold 
authoritarian government of gen alfredo stroessner and the 
increasingly critical roman catholic clergy 
the pontiff was scheduled to arrive monday for a 57hour visit 
to this overwhelmingly catholic country the last stop on a 12day 
pilgrimage that has taken him to uruguay bolivia and peru 
perhaps the most politically sensitive stop the visit has 
spotlighted deteriorating ties between the church and the rightist 
government whose members often describe clerical critics as 
communists and subversives 
in turn clerics 19 of whom have been expelled by the 
government since 1969 frequently attack alleged government 
corruption election fraud and human and civil rights violations 
although the government and the church collaborated in drawing 
up papal activities each has accused the other of attempting to 
manipulate the popes visit for political purposes 
a furor arose last week when the government abruptly canceled 
for security reasons a tuesday night meeting of the pontiff and 
the builders of society a civic group that includes members of 
opposition political parties not recognized by the government 
vatican pressure and two days of talks finally won a reversal 
the government agreed to allow the meeting in a staterun sports 
arena but said it would hold the church responsible for ensuring 
its religious nature 
jose maria troche of the episcopal conference said 3800 people 
had been invited to the meeting 
but only 140 members of the government president stroessners 
ruling colorado party and the armed forces were included 
although the party whose official newspaper patria earlier 
described the meeting as a corrupt assembly made no official 
comment party spokesmen told asuncion newspapers sunday that 
members would boycott the meeting 
party spokesmen said invitations were disproportionate with a 
february national election that gave the party and stroessner 
reelected to eight straight terms after a 1954 coup 89 precent 
of the vote the opposition claims the election was fraudulent 
stroessner controls the government with his colorado party 
though paraguay has elections in which some recognized opposition 
candidates are elected twothirds of congress belong to the 
colorado party 
the church has criticized the decision to allow only 
statecontrolled radio and television to cover papal activities in 
this nation of 38 million where about 97 percent of the 
population is catholic 
while radio caritas the church station that often airs 
interviews with opposition leaders announced it would refrain from 
government criticism during the papal visit all stations 
including caritas are obliged to relay official coverage 
how can those who describe our bishops priest and laymen as 
communists hope to explain to our people the feelings of the 
church said monsignor pastor cuquejo auxiliary bishop of 
asuncion and coordinator of the paraguay portion of the visit 
public reaction to the papal visit was mixed although elaborate 
preparations were nearing completion in this capital of 800000 and 
the four interior cities to be visited by the pontiff 
sure there is a lot of enthusiasm just look at that said 
a taxi driver as he pointed to a huge altar built near asuncions 
international airport hundreds of army conscripts were cutting 
grass with machetes around the city 
asuncion streets were freshly scrubbed and decorated with 
welcoming banners 
yet there were signs of ennui i think the people are plain 
tired of the pope said a paraguayan journalist who requested 
anonymity dont forget this is his last stop and people have 
been following his trip since may 7 
he said his newspaper had received numerous calls from mothers 
who complained that their children had lost too much class time in 
practicing for papal events

an afghan guerrilla leader said sunday 
his fighters will attack the key afghan city of jalalabad as soon 
as it is free of red army troops 
mahmood a commander in the radical hezbiislami guerrilla 
faction made the claim as the first of an estimated 6000 soviet 
soldiers left jalalabad a strategic city in northeastern 
afghanistan 45 miles west of the pakistan border 
the soviet troops are reportedly being replaced by up to 12000 
soldiers from the afghan army 
there will be a lot of army there it will need a lot of 
pressure mahmood said 
he said he had 10000 men under his command near the city but 
could not predict when jalalabad the heavily fortified capital of 
nangarhar province would be in rebel hands 
he explained that the city is surrounded by land mines canals 
and rivers 
some mujahedeen cannot swim mahmood said with a sheepish 
grin 
mujahedeen or holy warrior is a term the rebels use to 
describe themselves they have been fighting the sovietbacked 
communist government in kabul for 10 years 
mahmood said his fighters would make full use of antiaircraft 
weapons to shoot down soviet and afghan helicopters as they 
evacuate soviet troops or resupply kabul troops 
the rebels claimed they shot down two soviet mi24 helicopter 
gunships over jalalabad on friday 
accompanied by district commander zurabgul khomainy mahmood 
said his fighters in coordination with three other parties of 
rebel fighters would concentrate first on the security posts 
surrounding jalalabad then work on clearing mines 
the united states a major arms supplier to the guerrillas has 
recently sent them sophisticated mineclearing devices as with 
other commanders mahmood would not be specific about which weapons 
his men possess but described their supply situation as less than 
we wish 
over the past month the rebels reportedly have overrun dozens 
of security posts in eastern afghanistan as soviet forces handed 
them over to kabul troops 
the morale of the mujahedeen is very good but the morale of 
the kabul army is weak now said mahmood 
the rebel forces recently proposed a limited amnesty to afghan 
regulars saying that any troops who surrender within four weeks of 
the soviets withdrawal will not be tried for war crimes 
the fall of jalalabad would be a major blow to afghan president 
najib in his effort to keep his marxist government in power after 
the soviet withdrawal 
under terms of an accord signed in geneva in april all soviet 
troops must be out of afghanistan in nine months 
pakistan is a conduit of arms to the guerrillas and serves as 
their headquarters it also shelters about 35 million war refugees

chinas government concerned about its growing 
foreign debt is setting up a debt management office to ensure that 
borrowing does not exceed its ability to pay an official report 
said sunday 
the englishlanguage newspaper china daily said the state 
council chinas cabinet is expected to approve plans to establish 
the office in the ministry of finance according to an unidentified 
source in the ministry 
it said the department will supervise all of chinas foreign 
and domestic debts and set up a buffer fund to ensure 
availability of cash to pay interest 
it also will play a role in drafting the national budget and 
debt policies and establishing accounting systems the report said 
it did not specify if the department will have authority to veto 
loans it considers unwise 
chinas foreign debt totaled about 168 billion at the end of 
last year the report said up from zero 10 years ago when the 
country began its drive to open its markets and absorb foreign 
technology 
although international debt experts still consider china a good 
risk chinese economists have expressed concern over the lack of 
central control over borrowing 
three ministries including the ministry of finance two banks 
and 10 provinces have independent authority to borrow money 
directly from foreign banks and issue bonds in foreign currencies 
in an effort to stimulate development the government has given 
increasing autonomy to coastal cities and provinces to make their 
own economic decisions including foreign loans 
several companies have been unable to repay loans from foreign 
banks and have sought government assistance 
the china daily indicated the government is not seeking to cut 
back on foreign borrowing only to supervise it more closely 
it quoted the ministry of finance source as saying china expects 
to increase its foreign debt through 1990 but will borrow only to 
build key state projects 
communist party general secretary zhao ziyang was quoted as 
telling visiting irish president patrick hillery last week that 
chinas slow growth in past decades was due to reluctance to borrow 
he said chinas principles are to borrow only for potentially 
profitable projects and to take careful account of the borrowers 
debtservicing ability the newspaper said

call this a gold rush town and no one 
will argue the window displays of miners picks and gold pans the 
restored bawdy houses and the cancan dancers all say klondike 
but since the cars of the white pass amp yukon railroad rolled out 
of town thursday and up the trail of 98 for the first time in more 
than five years skagways gotten back what locals consider its 
real image 
it gives us our identity back skagways always been a 
railroad town says gary danielson a train man turned city 
tourism director 
for 82 years after its completion in 1900 the white pass amp 
yukon was the life of skagway it carried freight miners and 
tourists from this seaport town up through the white pass of the 
coast mountains to the yukon territory of canada while other gold 
rush boom towns died and disappeared skagway prospered with its 
railroad 
the bust came in june 1982 with closure of the yukons 
cyprusanvil lead and zinc mine the railroad lost its cargo and 
threequarters of its revenues it closed a few months later 
the town of 800 people lost 150 jobs and in the decline that 
followed nearly half its population 
for a lot of people it was face it if youre going to live 
in skagway youre going to draw unemployment recalls lee 
hartson one of those suddenly left jobless 
hartson left town to work on the alaska railroad in anchorage 
at us customs and a few other jobs 
many railroad families stayed in skagway but the town lost its 
pride says dawn nelson an 11year resident 
up until the train quit running we could say we were a 
railroad town and that has a different connotation than being just 
a tourist town nelson says 
now she listens for the shrill whistle of engine no 73 as it 
rolls down the tracks a few blocks from the dress shop where she 
works the sound that says alls well again in skagway 
hearing that steam whistle blow was a part of our lives part 
of every day she says it sounds wonderful 
hartsons living by the whistle as well back as conductor since 
the white pass amp yukon was reborn as a tourist attraction 
at least twice a day hell be loading passengers at the cruise 
ship docks for a threehour ride along the tracks that shadow the 
deadhorse trail the path that once wore out men and killed their 
horses 
the white pass steams at a steady 15 mph up the gorge of the 
skagway river past the grave of soapy smith legendary badman 
of the gold rush barrooms and past the white pass ghost town where 
thousands once rested before their final assent to the summit and 
the canadian border 204 miles and 2865 vertical feet from the 
seaside depot 
from the snowpacked cliff above the summits deadhorse gulch 
where the train turns around theres little to see but much to 
sense 
trail of 98 says the marker the only break in a landscape 
of snow and rock and stunted spruce the snow headhigh in may 
shrouds the bones of more than 3000 pack animals driven to death 
by the klondikebound in the winter of 1897 and 1898 
theres a sense of the dead and the desperate in the rock walls 
of white pass but its a living history that steve hites is 
peddling as he sashays through the cars of the white pass amp yukon 
in turnofthecentury garb 
these wooden parlor cars theyre works of art theyre museum 
pieces says hites who started as a baggage handler in 1972 and 
now is the railroads promotion man 
as other narrowgauge railroads were abandoned throughout north 
america white pass collected cars dating to 1883 the gypsywagon 
roof shapes turtlebacks and clerestories to railroad buffs 
cover art deco interiors complete with ornate stoves 
the first white pass coaches four flatbeds with benches 
carried local celebrities to the end of the line then four miles 
from town on july 21 1898 
miners immediately began buying rides along the halfbuilt line 
to escape the brutal path below but granite weather and an 
unsteady work force delayed the lines completion two more years 
miners laid iron whenever they were broke then abandoned the 
tracks when they got enough pay to make a run for the gold fields 
there was the old joke about the white pass having three 
crews the crew that had left the crew that was thinking of 
leaving and the crew that was being brought in hites says 
the last spike on the white pass was driven in carcrosse yukon 
on july 29 1900 
by 1901 the white pass was in the tourism business selling 
eightday luxury excursions from seattle to dawson yukon by 
steamship railway and riverboat 
the future hites says is still uncertain the line needs 
50000 passengers a year at 67 a head to stay in business hites 
wont know until next year if thats realistic 
in skagway they arent worried 
the populations topping 700 again almost 250000 tourists are 
expected this year and danielson says two more cruise ships have 
promised to come in 1989 because of the railroad 
it gives us the anchor that we need danielson said it 
seems like we have everything back again

democratic frontrunner michael dukakis 
continued to gain steam among iowa democrats winning the bulk of 
delegates selected at congressional district conventions this 
weekend 
dukakis won 12 of the 34 delegates at stake while backers of 
missouri rep richard gephardt were able to elect nine delegates 
who are technically uncommitted 
gephardt won the states feb 8 precinct caucuses but has since 
dropped out of the race many of the nine uncommitted delegates are 
expected to endorse dukakis 
that group remained together to make it easier to elect their 
leaders to cherished national delegate posts at the convention in 
atlanta july 1821 party leaders list them as neutral although 
some insisted on carrying gephardts banner 
jesse jackson dukakis sole remaining active opponent won 
seven delegates while illinois sen paul simon collected six 
simon has put his campaign on hold but is still technically an 
active candidate and eligible for delegates 
dukakis backers said they were satisfied with the outcome of the 
six district conventions and party officials said the results 
showed iowa joining the rest of the nation in handing the 
massachusetts governor the frontrunners mantle 
i think certainly nobody should be surprised said iowa 
democratic party spokesman phil roeder dukakis came out on top 
which is what he should have done 
he predicted dukakis margin would grow during the month leading 
to the partys state convention on june 25 when 18 more delegates 
will be selected the state convention is the final step in iowas 
fourstep process of choosing delegates the early round precinct 
caucuses pushed iowa into the national spotlight because it was the 
nations first contest but no delegates were picked 
in addition to the delegates elected at saturdays conventions 
iowa will send nine super delegates party leaders and elected 
officials whose titles won them seats as delegates to the 
national convention 
two super delegates have already endorsed dukakis including 
state chairwoman bonnie campbell who came under criticism saturday 
at some of the conventions for her endorsement some activists 
introduced resolutions calling for her to drop her support 
if she had it to do all over again shed do the same thing 
roeder said arguing that her endorsement was important in currying 
favor with dukakis in hopes of retaining the states early place in 
the nominating battle

after outlining legislative programs 
designed to pay off louisianas ballooning deficit gov buddy 
roemer has conceded that hes going to have to scale down some of 
his proposals 
during the first three weeks of the annual session legislators 
have grilled the new governors budget officials and questioned 
whether his budget is balanced the house also watered down one of 
the governors key legislative programs tightening up campaign 
finance laws 
roemer has proposed a 78 billion state budget for the new 
fiscal year down from the 81 billion plan approved for the 
198788 fiscal year 
during his campaign roemer had ambitious plans for economic 
development for revamping the states tax system and for improving 
education and the environment 
he believed then that the state faced a 150 million shortfall 
however when he took office two months ago he found he had 
inherited a 2 billion crisis 
shortly before his inauguration he said his role as governor 
would have to combine the two roles of crisis manager and longterm 
planner 
they legislators know weve got a lot of work to do and it 
cant be all my way i dont expect that roemer said but i 
wanted us to get off the mark and get to work on these problems 
together 
one of the trickiest issues facing the new governor is how to 
reach his goal of weaning local governments and school boards from 
state subsidies that now total more than 400 million a year 
during louisianas populist history the state has appropriated 
money for supplemental pay for police and firefighters and parish 
road funds it has also paid for school bus drivers and school 
cafeteria workers 
following meetings with mayors demonstrations at the capitol by 
school employees and criticism from lawmakers roemer said last 
week that some type of bridge funding would be provided for the 
next fiscal year 
however he didnt say how much the funding would total or 
where it would come from 
roemer added about 95 million to his budget last week to 
restore a planned 10 percent pay cut for state employees and keep a 
charity hospital open as a clinic 
to make up part of the difference most state agencies would 
take an additional 3 percent acrosstheboard cut in administrative 
costs and patients at state charity hospitals would have to pay a 
small fee for each visit 
although the roemer administration has maintained that the 
proposed budget is in balance it has acknowledged that the budget 
overlooks a projected 260 million loss in state sales taxes 
rep raymond laborde a former floor leader for gov edwin 
edwards who was ousted last fall by roemer said i dont think 
this budget is balanced i dont think the governor thinks this 
budget is balanced i dont think the governors people think this 
budget is balanced 
last week the house refused to go along with many of roemers 
proposals to tighten up campaign finance laws although it did 
approve some restrictions on contributions 
the governor wants a law in which all cash contributions are 
outlawed and candidates must report 10 days in advance the amount 
of money theyll be doling out for getoutthevote efforts on 
election day and who will receive that cash the house refused to 
go along with those proposals 
during his campaign roemer limited individual contributors to 
1000 and took no money from political action committees 
under the measure that finally emerged from the house no 
candidate for statewide office could receive more than 5000 from 
any individual or from any political action committee 
they put some limits on individual contributions they limited 
pacs which you know is important to me roemer said theyve 
got some things i wish werent in there but theyve made a step 
forward

democrats and republicans have yet to 
nominate their parties standardbearers this november but 15 
modernday betsy rosses are embroidering the flags that will 
accompany the new president who will take office next january 
in the basement of building 13 of the defense departments 
supply center below the gymnasiumsized rooms where huge spools of 
olive drab thread turn into acres of us army fatigues the women 
of the embroidering room serve the next president with needles in 
hand and thimbles on fingers 
beyond the whine of sewing machines behind the cinder block 
walls the basement of building 13 is the only place in the country 
where the presidents flags are made 
tiny spots of chalk dust outline the eagle and stars that make 
up the presidents coat of arms as the women gently poke 19 colors 
of silk and synthetic threads through the navy blue rayon banner 
held taut across a wooden rack 
for the women in the embroidery room who spend most of their 
time embroidering detail on military units flags the opportunity 
to work on a flag for the president holds a special thrill 
when he talks on television i look at the seal said maria 
t negron who learned embroidery as a hobby while growing up in 
puerto rico 
the women embroider hundreds of flags each year for various 
military units cabinet members and congress but the presidential 
flag is most important the workers said 
we make sure all the employees get a chance to work on a 
presidential flag its one of the best morale builders said 
frank bennett production chief at the centers manufacturing 
directorate 
one worker can embroider both sides of a 4foot 4inch by 
5foot 6inch presidential flag in nine weeks bennett said 
however if a deadline is looming two or more women will embroider 
the same flag he said 
two or three flags are made for the president in most years but 
with a new president taking office seven new flags are being 
created 
this flag symbolizes the most powerful office in the world 
and wherever he goes the flag goes with him bennett said 
at least five are always in use one at the oval office one 
aboard air force one one at the white house portico for outdoor 
speeches and receptions for heads of state one with the 
presidents honor guard and one as backup said col victor m 
hernandez chief of the manufacturing directorate at the supply 
center 
laden with symbolism the coat of arms features an american 
eagle clasping an olive branch in one talon and a bundle of 13 
arrows in the other a constellation of 13 stars runs through a 
series of rays coming from the eagles shoulders the rays shoot 
through an arc of thirteen cloud puffs 
the coat of arms also appears on the presidents seal which is 
most often seen attached to the front of a lectern 
the embroidery room is staffed by middleaged women who 
recognize that few members of the younger generation are interested 
in hand embroidery 
both sides have to be the same no machine can ever do that 
said connnie martins who brought her skill to philadelphia from 
portugal about 18 years ago my daughter she doesnt like it 
each stitch is matched on each side of the flag so the eagle 
looking to his right on one side is looking to its left on the 
other the only part that doesnt appear backward on the flags 
opposite side are the words e pluribus unum latin for out of 
many one 
when the embroidery is finished a synthetic goldtone fringe is 
stitched to three sides of the flag

dusty border town agreed that sunday was a great day because soviet 
troops were starting to leave afghanistan but they also agreed 
that peace was still far away 
yes i am happy this is a great day but only god knows when 
there will be peace and i can go home said khaled an afghan 
refugee from kabul 
he now runs a shop selling jewelry afghan carpets and war 
souvenirs in peshawars squalid saddar bazaar 
there were no celebrations in this city headquarters of moslem 
anticommunist guerrillas or in its sunbaked environs that are 
temporary home to about 35 million refugees of the afghan war 
it was business as usual although things were moving a bit 
slowly as the local moslems endured 104degree heat compounded by 
the religious month ramadan which forbids eating from sunrise to 
sunset 
horse and bullock carts hauling sugar cane and fruits plodded 
through the narrow smelly streets of the old city threewheeled 
taxis droned in and out of traffic fouling the air with pungent 
white exhaust 
the only relief was a brief afternoon dust storm which added 
grime to sweaty brows 
at the offices of the seven main guerrilla parties the bearded 
turbaned men alternately slept or continued to plan their 
anticommunist war effort 
mahmood a member of the hezbiislami faction and the chief 
guerrilla commander of afghanistans eastern nangarhar province 
said may 15 was no special day 
for us its the same we havent just started fighting he 
said well continue our holy war 
the idea as so frequently explained by the guerrillas is that 
afghanistan should be ruled by moslems and not by the promoscow 
peoples democratic party of afghanistan which they consider 
atheist 
in the moneychanging market of the old city business seemed 
slow 
people are fasting they dont have the energy to trade 
said shabir a pakistani 
manshi a pakistani driver of a battered toyota taxi said he 
was glad the red army was leaving afghanistan because it would mean 
the return of the refugees 
they take our jobs because they work cheap he said as he 
swerved to avoid an oncoming truck covered in chrome and painted 
in a kaleidescope of colors 
i know its hard for them but they cost us many many money 
for peshawar described by un officials as the refugee capital 
of the world sunday was the start of a new chapter in history 
but the general feeling seemed to be that it wouldnt be printed 
in ink until all soviet troops leave afghanistan and its marxist 
government falls

orchestras for decades have been playing the wrong 
version of anton dvoraks new world symphony and at least five 
of his other symphonies a conductor who analyzed his original 
manuscripts said sunday 
denis vaughan who spent two weeks examining the manuscripts in 
czechoslovakia said he found hundreds of differences between six 
of dvoraks original scores and the versions that were published in 
the last century 
they include differences in phrasing nuance accent dynamics 
and the way various instruments are blended he told the associated 
press 
the differences are audible to everyone and will enthrall 
listeners the world over he said 
vaughan said dvoraks wit and composing skills were beyond his 
early editors who took out his idiosyncrasies and wrote straight 
versions of what they thought he meant 
in for instance the eighth symphony theres some tricky 
delightful way in which each time he repeats a phrase he does it 
differently in a way which no conductor that ive met would have 
dreamed possible of dvorak vaughan said its just witty and 
fresh and playful 
the variations were taken out and the phrases standardized 
before the score was published he said 
vaughan said dvorak wrote his ninth symphony the new world 
symphony one of the most popular classical pieces in the united 
states in 1893 dvorak mailed the score to his german publishers 
but since he was so far away it was sent to vienna where johannes 
brahms his contemporary and admirer corrected the proofs 
vaughan said he has been deputy conductor for the royal 
philharmonic orchestra in london conductor at the munich opera 
house and musical director of the state opera of south australia 
and now is a freelance conductor 
he said he has previously uncovered discrepancies between the 
original scores and published works of franz schubert giuseppe 
verdi and giacomo puccini 
vaughan said he hopes to record the six dvorak symphonies for 
which the original manuscripts are available he said it will take 
him about a year to prepare the scores for an orchestra

red army troops lumbered into kabul on 
sunday after a daylong journey through mountains teeming with 
guerrillas as the soviet union began its retreat from more than 
eight years of war in afghanistan 
the 300vehicle convoy set out at 730 am for the 88mile trip 
from jalalabad passing through crowds of afghan children who threw 
flowers and an occasional clod of dirt or dung 
as the motorized rifle unit crossed the towering mountains 
separating jalalabad from kabul shots rang out from distant hills 
and the procession backed up in spots along the rough oneway road 
no casualties were reported 
at 330 pm the convoy reached kabul about 2000 afghans 
lined four miles of highway leading into the city said a western 
photographer 
many of them were soldiers or members of communist youth 
organizations dressed in red shirts with white scarves 
today the soviets are leaving im happy for them said abdu 
samir a 20yearold soldier as he watched the procession move 
into kabul 
samir said he hoped the afghan army would be strong enough to 
withstand attacks from anticommunist guerrillas 
long live friendship between afghanistan and the soviet 
union read a white banner flapping along the highway stenciled 
posters of a waving soviet soldier were tacked up nearby 
the soviets planned to spend the night in kabul before starting 
the 200mile trip to the soviet border monday 
the convoy out of jalalabad was the first of four that will 
leave the northeastern city near the pakistan border as it made 
its way toward kabul a guerrilla leader vowed that his men would 
attack jalalabad 
mahmood a commander in the hezbiislami guerrilla faction 
said his 10000 men would invade the city as soon as the red army 
was out 
lt gen vladimir bogdanov said the convoys would leave on 
alternate days to allow traffic in the opposite direction to use 
the road but that all soviets based in jalalabad would be withdrawn 
within two weeks 
anticommunist rebels fighting the sovietbacked government of 
president najib control some of the mountainous regions through 
which the convoy passed 
twenty western journalists were brought to jalalabad to ride 
with the convoy to kabul and during the night spent in the 
garrison city they heard heavy bombardment and felt the impact of a 
surfacetosurface missile that landed 90 feet from their hotel 
information about the start of the withdrawal was provided by a 
reuters news agency pool report associated press reporters were 
barred from covering the event soviet officials said the exclusion 
was the result of questions asked by the ap during a previous trip 
to kabul 
edmund mcwilliams deputy chiefofmission at the us embassy 
in kabul said the rebels have moved in closer to the capital and 
stepped up attacks 
weve had as you may know this past week quite a bit of 
rocketing of the city and were expecting possibly some more 
rocketing tonight mcwilliams said sunday it does not appear 
though at this point that the attacks will be affecting the 
pullout 
soviet troops and tanks moved into afghanistan on dec 27 1979 
to fight the anticommunist insurgency and replace one prosoviet 
government with another 
about 115000 soviet troops are in afghanistan to bolster 
najibs forces but all must pull back to soviet territory within 
the next nine months to comply with unmediated peace accords 
signed in geneva last month 
half the troops must leave by aug 15 under the agreement lt 
gen boris gromov told reporters saturday that about one quarter of 
the soldiers would be home before president reagan visits moscow on 
may 29 
the soviets departure will leave najibs army of 50000 alone 
in its battle against about 200000 moslem insurgents the 
guerrillas have vowed to fight on to topple the marxist government 
guerrillas and western observers estimate that about 15 million 
afghans have died in the war 
the us state department estimates soviet casualties since 1979 
at 3300038000 more than onethird of whom were killed 
on sunday the communist party leadership in moscow addressed 
the departing troops with words of thanks and a call for their help 
in improving soviet life once they return home 
days of severe trials lie behind you said the party central 
committee address printed on the front page of the party daily 
pravda you have fulfilled the order of your homeland 
tass reported that najib sent a message of thanks to soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev on sunday praising the heroic feat 
of the soviets in helping defend his government 
in a joint sovietafghan statement carried by the official 
soviet news agency the allied governments said the pivotal 
issue in ending the civil war that has gripped afghanistan for a 
decade would be ensuring an end to interference from the outside 
in the home affairs of the afghans 
soviet and afghan officials have accused the united states and 
pakistan of exacerbating the war by delivering arms to the rebels

solidarity leader lech walesa told tens of 
thousands of worshipers at an outdoor mass on sunday that poles 
will give their all for the country only when their rights are 
ensured 
it was the biggest public appearance by walesa since he and 
about 1000 followers emerged from the lenin shipyard in gdansk on 
tuesday to end a 9day sitin 
the strikers gave up without winning concessions on pay or 
recognition of solidarity the trade union federation outlawed 
after the imposition of martial law in 1981 
the mass was celebrated in walesas home city of gdansk where 
pope john paul ii praised solidarity during a visit to poland 11 
months ago 
workers and students keep solidarity young and understand that 
only solidarity of people and social groups can be the key to 
overcoming the crisis in our homeland said walesa who spoke for 
about 10 minutes at the end of the mass 
people are willing to give their all for the common good only 
when their full rights are safeguarded he said 
aides to walesa estimated the crowd at 50000 while western 
journalists said there were at least 30000 people 
the mass was celebrated by wroclaw bishop cardinal henryk 
gulbinowicz who has special responsibility for workers within the 
polish church it was attended by 30 bishops 
the service culminated a series of devotions nationwide in honor 
of the black madonna the medieval painting that is polands most 
revered icon 
we thank you mother of god for the strength to survive the 
past eight years walesa said referring to the martial law 
period of 198183 and polands current economic crisis he said 
poles still have the courage to say there is no freedom without 
solidarity 
walesa was the final speaker among several people representing 
various social groups 
the gathering was predominantly religious with almost no 
solidarity banners in evidence afterwards people dispersed 
peacefully 
walesa aide bogdan olszewski said in a telephone interview that 
there has been no police harassment of people who took part in the 
shipyard strike which occurred during two weeks of labor unrest 
polands worst since strikes swept the nation in 1980 
the official pap news service reported absenteeism only slightly 
higher than normal at the 10800worker shipyard thursday 
all but six of 38 people arrested when police broke up a strike 
at the lenin steelworks in nowa huta in southern poland on may 5 
have been ordered freed said jan rokita a krakowarea solidarity 
activist 
the six still under arrest were strike committee members said 
rokita he said they are accused of leading an illegal strike 
punishable by up to three years in prison

the air forces planned stealth bomber has 
risen in cost to an estimated 450 million per plane making it the 
most expensive aircraft ever built the washington post reported in 
its sunday editions 
the newspaper quoting unidentified us officials said the air 
force has told a few members of congress that its fleet of 132 
stealth bombers will cost at least 20 percent more than projected 
the northrop corp is building the planes 
at the same time the stealth fighter which is flying has been 
kept in production under a secret deal worked out by sen sam nunn 
dga chairman of the senate armed services committee the post 
said 
a defense department spokesman lt col keith schneider had no 
comment on the report 
the bomber fleets advertised price tag in fiscal 1981 dollars 
has jumped from 366 billion to 43 billion when expressed in 
1989 dollars which accounts for inflation since 1981 the cost has 
risen from 506 billion to 595 billion 
the stealth bomber is designed with a curvy shape and an 
absorbent skin which should enable it to evade soviet radar for a 
longer period than conventional aircraft giving defenders less 
time to react and knock the invader down 
the bombers estimated 450 million price tag which some 
analysts expect to go higher in the future compares with the 
estimated 278 million for the b1b bomber and 136 million for the 
c5b giant transport 
the stealth fighters now in operation have some of the same 
characteristics as the stealth bomber but cannot fly as far or 
carry as many weapons the lockheed corp which builds the stealth 
fighter has been lobbying congress to build a second group of the 
planes to help fill the arms gap to be left in europe when 
mediumrange nuclear weapons are eliminated under the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces inf treaty according to 
congressional officials who spoke to the newspaper 
nunn in negotiations on the fiscal 1988 military procurement 
bill late last year persuaded his colleagues to authorize extra 
millions to buy additional lockheed stealth fighters to replace 
some that crashed the paper said but the money added to the 
secret socalled black budget was for less than six of the 
stealth fighters and not for the new group of planes lockheed 
sought the officials told the post

a 77yearold merchant marine retiree has 
been charged with manslaughter in the death of a longtime neighbor 
who died when she tried to free one of her pet dogs from the mans 
electrified fence 
he had put up the fence to ward off a marauding pack of dogs 
but it was not installed properly and contained a lethal strength 
of electric current police said 
the victim 73yearold bertha augusta brittingham was buried 
friday although a neighbor managed to free her from the fence ms 
brittingham was dead on arrival tuesday at a hospital in cambridge 
james joseph kahl who for many years had lived next door to ms 
brittingham in a rural dorchester county area is free on his own 
recognizance pending a court hearing on a date to be set 
he declined friday to discuss the death other than to say it 
was a difficult experience and that he has removed the electric 
fence 
police said that when kahl put up the 20footlong electric 
fence he failed to install a regulator that would have sent 
pulsating current through the wire instead of a steady flow of 110 
volts that killed the elderly woman 
that amount of voltage could kill anyone its like grabbing a 
metal lamp with a frayed wire and not being able to let go of it

some are angry others are sorry but all of the 
people caught up in the zero tolerance crackdown at the 
uscanada border walk away without their car or truck 
many also have had to pay onthespot fines ranging up to 1000 
as their cost of the new attitude of the us customs service 
toward drugs even small amounts at the border crossing 
since march 21 103 people have been arrested 244 vehicles 
seized and one boat taken because any amount of drugs were found 
dan holland district us customs service director for washington 
state said last week 
every thursday the victims of the crackdown can be found at us 
district court hoping to reclaim their vehicles 
one canadian citizen complained that customs inspectors laughed 
as they seized his 45000 1988 porsche at blaine wash inside the 
car was a gram of marijuana enough to fit in the palm of a hand 
another said customs inspectors used tweezers to remove the 1 
of a gram of marijuana enough to fit on the end of a finger 
discovered at the bottom of her purse 
a third held for six hours after his arrest said the only 
people they stopped and inspected were people wearing jeans and 
jean jackets no one wearing a suit was stopped 
all three commented after the court session thursday only on 
condition that they not be named 
its down to almost the ridiculous said michael martin a 
federal public defender representing some zero tolerance 
victims in the northwest 
i spent all day doing zero tolerance cases i have serious 
felony cases pending and this takes away from my ability to handle 
those cases the impact in time is enormous but the impact on 
these individuals defendants is horrendous 
lawrence ladage chief customs agent in seattle says theres no 
room for flexibility 
were hoping the word will get out leave your dope at home or 
knock it off said ladage 
there is a lot of remorse a lot of amazement the 
realization that maybe this is serious after all ladage said 
mostly it is utter disbelief you have a brand new trans am 
and all of a sudden you are walking 
approximately 60 cases have gone through the federal court in 
seattle each involved a misdemeanor count of possession of a 
controlled substance mostly marijuana and one felony count of 
importing a controlled substance 
in each case the defendant pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor 
count and was placed on a years probation the felony count was 
dismissed said peter voelker criminal supervisor at the court 
in a minority of cases to date customs has assessed owners of

the syrian army warned sunday that it 
will move into beiruts devastated southern slums with 
shoottokill orders and demanded that warring shiite moslem 
militias halt their 10dayold bloodbath 
more than 7500 syrian troops and about 500 tanks and armored 
vehicles massed around the labyrinthine slums where 18 western 
hostages including nine americans are believed held by factions 
linked to the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god 
the syrian troops include two battalions of elite special forces 
commandoes syrian and lebanese military sources said 
brig gen ghazi kenaan syrias military intelligence commander 
in lebanon told the prosyrian amal militia and hezbollah to lay 
down their arms 
asked when the syrians would make their move into the 
16squaremile warren of narrow alleyways and cementblock houses 
kenaan said this is our decision well decide the right 
moment 
he warned our forces will shoot without hesitation any gunman 
on the street or in buildings 
as syrian troops surrounded the slums dozens of families were 
seen fleeing in convoys of bulletscarred cars packed with clothes 
and blankets 
since intense fighting broke out may 6 between amal and 
hezbollah police say most of the slums 250000 residents have 
fled at least 211 people have been killed and 586 wounded 
lebanons interior minister abdulla rassi told the associated 
press that the syrians are going to enter the suburbs in a day or 
two but im not setting deadlines 
hezbollahs spiritual guide sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah 
branded syrias military buildup an act of intimidation 
he said all the suburbs will be destroyed if the syrians 
attempt to enter by force indicating that hezbollah which has 
fielded around 3000 hardcore fighters would resist the syrians 
shell blasts echoed across the capital as kenaan spoke at a news 
conference in west beirut 
police said hezbollah and amal militiamen were locked in 
artillery duels but they had no reports of overall casualties 
in one incident police said a shell hit the fourth floor of a 
10story building crowded with palestinians in west beiruts 
sanayeh district killing a baby and two adults and wounding four 
other people 
it was imperative for syria to take the decision to rescue the 
people from this bloodbath kenaan declared 
so orders have been issued to the syrian arab forces to enter 
the southern suburbs and enforce security in the enclave 
he added we call on the gunmen in the suburbs to lay down 
their arms and warn them without exception of the 
consequences of firing a single bullet at our forces 
kenaan cut off a reporter who asked whether the syrians would 
seek to free the foreign hostages there is a disaster in the 
area people are suffering distress that we will try to end he 
said without elaboration 
the syrian decision to commit its troops into what could 
deteriorate into housetohouse fighting underlined the failure of 
amal the syrians strongest lebanese ally to crush hezbollah 
hezbollahs fighters have seized control of the slums in 10 days 
of savage fighting with amal which is led by justice minister 
nabih berri 
when the fighting began hezbollah held about onethird of the 
district that borders beirut airport 
kenaan declined to say whether the syrian decision to move into 
the slums was taken in coordination with iran 
syria is irans main arab ally in the 7yearold gulf war 
against iraq 
but that alliance which is increasingly crucial to iran after a 
string of military setbacks and growing political isolation has 
come under strain in recent months 
syria considers neighboring lebanon its sphere of influence it 
has been alarmed by hezbollahs drive with tehrans blessing and 
financing to dominate lebanons 12 million shiites the largest 
single sect in the country 
the syrians moved 25000 troops into north and east lebanon 
under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping mandate 
they also deployed 7500 troops in west beirut in february 1987 
in an effort to end three years of militia anarchy but despite 
bombings and kidnappings they have not until now sought to move 
into south beirut 
the christianrun voice of lebanon radio said without naming a 
source that the hostages are now held in the basement of the 
iranian embassy in a seaside neighborhood outside the battle zone 
this report is untrue its absolutely baseless an embassy 
spokesman said he declined to be named 
the weekly ashshiraa magazine reported earlier that the 
captives were moved during the fighting from an exposed hezbollah 
barracks to the home of hezbollah spokesman sheik ibrahim alamin 
in the less vulnerable haret hreik neighborhood the report could 
not be verified 
police said most of the 250000 people who lived in the slums 
mostly poor shiites have fled since the fighting erupted

yannash scott was having a hard time 
staying awake but the 15yearold was keeping a vigil with his 
mother and other relatives of hostages held 300 yards away in mack 
alford correctional center 
ill beat you mom if i keep this up he said he showed 
his mother his watch to make the point that by early sunday morning 
hed already been up 26 hours his father is one of the three 
prison guards held hostage by about 20 inmates since late friday 
night 
the teen didnt flinch when his mother said hed have to keep it 
up at least another day to beat her personal record set some time 
ago of 56 hours without sleep 
ill make it 57 just to show you he said playfully 
but its a bet hed gladly lose if he could just see his father 
and return home 
i never thought this would happen to dad not my dad the 
boy said i wish theyd let him go 
there had been little word for relatives of prison guard ronnie 
scott or fellow hostages harold yoder and lewis mcgee prison 
officials have said the three are in good health and have not been 
injured but little else is known 
its really aggravating sitting here waiting yannash said 
yoders wife carolyn yoder was also among those keeping the 
vigil on the lawn outside where the hostages were held six family 
members of hostages waited through the early morning sitting on 
lawn chairs blankets and cushions 
when they had anything to tell us during the day they would 
come over with it mrs yoder said referring to prison 
officials behavior saturday ive got no complaints about that 
later however mrs yoder would joke to a friend after not 
hearing from prison officials until several hours after sunrise 
sunday that i knew id have to read the paper to find out what 
was going on in there 
tempers flared a bit as the group talked among themselves 
through the predawn hours rick oumstead a nephew of one of the 
hostages couldnt believe the prisons warden ted wallman hadnt 
met with some of the women in the group 
i dont know the warden i never met him mrs yoder said 
i know the chaplain hes the one who comes out here to talk to 
us 
what they ought to do is go in there with that special swat 
team she said those boys are smart enough to know what 
theyre doing id feel a lot safer with them going in there to 
take my husband 
the suggestion of the hostile prisoners being allowed to 
transfer to a federal prison in el reno angered the group the 
transfer idea was later rejected by the inmates 
why should they get to go to a federal prison mrs yoder 
asked i suppose so they can play tennis and have a swimming 
pool 
my way of thinking the ringleader ought not to be allowed to 
walk away from this oumstead said

very important for me and i was in the neighborhood

land

soviet and western intelligence agencies knew 
of kurt waldheims world war ii past but did not block his 
selection as un secretarygeneral in hopes of using him for 
political gains a us jewish leader said sunday 
edgar bronfman president of the new yorkbased world jewish 
congress also said his organization gave the soviets a list of 
50000 names of nazi war criminals that were obtained from us 
files 
bronfman made his comments at a news conference after flying to 
jerusalem from moscow where he said he met with soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze 
it has become inreasingly clear that every secret service 
including the americans knew of waldheims war record bronfman 
said 
waldheim president of austria since his election in june 1986 
served as un secretarygeneral from 19721982 he has denied 
allegations that he was involved in war crimes while serving as a 
lieutenant in the german army in the balkans during world war ii 
everybody felt that they had something on waldheim so he would 
behave bronfman said so it was agreed to let waldheim become 
secretary general of the united nations 
bronfman declined to say how he knew western and soviet 
intelligence knew of waldheims war past and did not explain how 
walheim may have been pressured while un secretarygeneral 
an austrianappointed international panel of six historians 
concluded in february that waldheim knew about nazi wartime 
atrocities while serving in the balkans in 194245 but the 
committee found no evidence that waldheim committed war crimes 
in 1947 the yugoslav government included waldheims name on a 
list of suspected war criminals but soon dropped a request to 
austria for his extradition without explanation 
a british newspaper the sunday express asserted last year the 
yugoslav information left waldheim open to soviet bloc blackmail 
the paper said it had a dec 12 1947 memo from uros n 
djaelic then chief of yugoslavias legal bureau that detailed 
what it called waldheims involvement in war crimes 
the sunday exparess quoted the memo as saying waldheim who 
was responsible for hostages and contacts with collaborators 
can be of value to the interests of yugoslavia 
it quoted anon kolendic the senior intelligence officer for 
yugoslavia in 1948 as saying he gave information on waldheim to 
the soviet secret service 
the paper reported a spokesman for waldheim denied the 
allegations 
another world jewish congress official ilan steinberg said 
private investigators are now looking into waldheims activities on 
the russian front in 1941 
bronfman said his group gave the soviets a list of 50000 names 
of suspected nazi war criminals that were found in newly 
declassified us government files he said the information was 
passed on directly to soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev

two gunmen entered a pub as 
diners were finishing lunch sunday and opened fire on the crowd 
killing three people and wounding six before fleeing in a 
commandeered taxi police and witnesses said 
ten people were taken to hospitals six with gunshot wounds and 
four suffering from shock according to police 
an anonymous telephone caller told the british broadcasting 
corp that the attack on the tavern patronized by roman catholics 
was carried out by the protestant action force 
but a spokesman at bbcs belfast office said the caller did not 
give a recognized code used by the extremist protestant action 
force and the assertion could not be confirmed 
sinn fein the legal political wing of the outlawed and 
predominantly catholic irish republican army blamed the attack on 
protestant militants 
the avenue bar on union street was preparing to close at 230 
pm when the gunmen rang the bell and were admitted through the 
electronically operated door police said 
witnesses speaking on condition of anonymity said there were 
about 20 people in the bar when the gunmen entered and appeared to 
be looking for someone 
a guy came in and took his time looking around and then 
started shooting one witness said then the other one came in 
behind him and started shooting at people it was just 
indiscriminate people were trying to dive for cover but they had 
no chance 
police said two people died at the scene and the third was 
pronounced dead on arrival at a hospital moments after the 
shooting three priests arrived to administer last rites to the 
dead 
the gunmen had hijacked a taxi in the protestant shankill road 
area just before the attack and afterward drove off in the 
direction of shankill road 
police and troops rushed into the area around the pub and set up 
roadblocks an army helicopter hovered above 
local people said the victims were from unity flats ballymurphy 
and north queen street all catholic districts 
the attack the first of its kind in years in belfast fueled 
fears of reprisals in the sectarian warfare that has ravaged this 
predominantly protestant british province 
tom king britains secreatry for northern ireland called the 
killings a revolting outrage sinn fein president gerry adams 
said the attack was an attempt at mass murder 
both men appealed for calm 
there is no place in a civilized society for people as 
depraved as these killers and that holds true for anybody who has 
ever raised a gun in northern ireland in pursuit of sectarian or 
political ends king said 
one thing northern ireland does not need now is talk of 
retaliation and revenge good sense and restraint are what is 
needed 
adams said the area is very tense and local people are very 
angry i appeal for calm and discipline 
the protestant action force is an offshoot of the ulster 
volunteer force both organizations are illegal 
the ira is fighting to unite northern ireland where protestants 
outnumber catholics 32 with the overwhelmingly catholic republic 
of ireland

more than a hundred bird watchers spotted 
a record number of species in the fifth annual world series of 
birding despite the adverse effects of a cold wet spring on 
migrations 
the zeiss team a new jersey group led by peter dunne of 
bernardsville spotted 200 species to beat 27 other teams from the 
united states and great britain and capture the silver urnerstone 
cup 
the bird watchers covered prime spots throughout the new 
jerseys marshes woodlands and shores from midnight friday to 
midnight saturday 
some teams traveled more than 400 miles during the contest 
which started at the pequannock watershed about 40 miles northwest 
of new york city and ending in the cape may region in the south 
the states best spot for night watching said paul kerlinger 
director of the cape may bird observatory 
dunne who created the competition and was a member of the first 
winning team said this years event was marred by a blustery 
spring that slowed migrating patterns last years winning team 
spotted 205 species 
there were no birds dunne said sunday it was silent 
spring it was cold and wet and birds just dont like those 
conditions 
dunne said the key to his teams success was that it just got 
the meat and potatoes birds including clutches of warblers and 
kingfishers 
despite the poor spring kerlinger said contestants spotted a 
combined total of 254 species the best ever the most striking 
sighting was that of a sooty shearwater an ocean bird rarely seen 
from land spotted off cape may he said 
the obstacles werent all natural this years runnerup the 
woolrichinternational council for bird preservation from britain 
sat through a twohour delay on the new jersey turnpike during the 
competition they managed to spot 194 species 
the event raised nearly 80000 in pledges to conservation 
groups said tom gilmore director of the new jersey audobon

county councils refusal to grant a testdrilling permit for the 
area near ashdown forest

however there never can be a total victory while it is 
government policy to drill for oil regardless of what lies on the 
surface 
they will drill anywhere except possibly under buckingham

democratic presidential candidate jesse 
jackson called on graduating students to keep hope alive as he 
paid tribute to his motherinlaw who received her college diploma 
here sunday at the age of 61 
jackson also used the occasion to make an emotional pledge to 
press on with his flagging campaign 
i want to talk today about the challenge to keep hope alive 
of making it on broken pieces he told students at commencement 
ceremonies for predominantly black hampton university 
among the graduates was gertrude brown whose life of struggle 
was movingly related by her soninlaw jackson 
mrs brown who was an unwed mother as a teenager worked full 
time as she raised five children including daughter jacqueline 
the girl who would grow up to become jacksons wife 
three of her children went on to receive advanced degrees when 
she was 49 mrs brown decided her own time had come she went back 
to get her high school diploma and began her college education 
still working full time she painstakingly took one or two classes 
a semester 
a dozen years later she reached her goal 
she is of strong character and she never surrendered against 
all odds she is graduating today that is what this graduation 
is all about jackson said 
calling up images of determination and pride jackson invoked 
the fight for civil rights 
we worked through blood and smiled through our tears to get to 
this juncture in the road the struggle must continue he told 
the crowd we must not surrender 
jackson urged redefinition of the nations priorities to help 
the poor homeless and powerless he called for more taxes on the 
wealthy and for us allies to assume a greater share of defense 
burdens 
jackson said he would remember his motherinlaws example as he 
campaigned for the democratic presidential nomination 
i will never surrender to the odds said jackson who lags 
far behind the democratic frontrunner michael dukakis he led the 
audience in a chant keep hope alive 
jackson challenged the graduates to help care for those who 
could not help themselves 
i challenge our nation to do justice and to love mercy we 
must keep america strong and make america better how we relate to 
the least of these the children in the dawn of life poor people 
in the pit of life old folks in the sunset of life is a 
measurement of our character jackson told the audience of more 
than 11000 at hampton coliseum 
jackson said as president he would double the federal dollars 
spent on education 
it makes more sense to invest in public education day care 
and prenatal care on the front side of life rather than jail care 
welfare and despair on the back side of life he said 
he also called for raising the minimum wage working to bring 
womens wages in line with those of men and providing universal 
health insurance 
later sunday jackson addressed new jersey democrats who were 
holding their state convention new jerseys primary is june 7 the

about 4700 united rubber workers members 
struck firestone inc plants in six states sunday and another 
15000 union members are poised to strike goodyear tire amp rubber 
co at noon tuesday 
the firestone employees walked out after negotiators in 
cleveland failed to reach an agreement prior to a 1201 am sunday 
deadline 
there are no talks scheduled at this point and there is no 
indication of when new talks could occur firestone spokesman jim 
strandberg said sunday 
the disabled firestone facilities are in akron ohio 
noblesville ind des moines iowa decatur ill russellville 
ark and oklahoma city the des moines decatur and oklahoma city 
plants make tires the nobelesville plant makes molded rubber 
products and the russellville plant makes innertubes 
in des moines about 20 firestone employees picketed the plants 
five gates sunday afternoon even though no work shifts were 
scheduled until 11 pm said bill winslow a production worker and 
picket captain 
there wont be any vulgar language no open drinking no 
harassing the people who want to cross the picket line no throwing 
things winslow said weve got a good image and we want to 
keep it he said firestone has already got their image dont 
they 
at firestones tire plant in oklahoma city about 10 workers 
were on a picket line said don adams vice president of local 998 
as the firestone strike began a vote sunday by a local in 
danville va threatened to produce an even larger nationwide 
strike tuesday against goodyear 
the goodyear pact was negotiated as an agreement to serve as a 
pattern for other rubber companies but goodyears 15000 urw 
members rejected the tentative contract by a 31 ratio on may 1 
fewer than half of the 1668 members of local 831 turned out for 
the secret ballot sunday on whether to take another look at the 
proposal the vote was 476339 against reconsidering union 
officials said 
if nothing changes if the union and the company dont get 
back together at 12 oclock tuesday high noon there will be a 
strike said linwood saunders president of the local 
six of the 11 goodyear locals approved the pact but did not 
represent a majority of the goodyear membership in the urw under 
urw bylaws ratification must be made by a majority of the locals 
representing a majority of the membership 
urw president milan stone said firestones latest proposal did 
not match the pattern settlement 
firestone did not present us with anywhere near a pension 
offer that was negotiated with goodyear they did not present to 
us the cost of living allowance provisions goodyear granted and 
there was no provision in there for fully paid hospital 
insurance stone said 
these are the three issues that are very dear to our hearts 
and we will fight to keep those and thats why were on strike 
he said 
were willing to meet at anytimethe next move is up to them 
when they want to get back together stone said 
firestone officials defended their proposal as fair 
we are deeply distressed that the union has taken this 
action george w aucott firestones executive vice president 
said in a statement we believe that our proposal contains a 
number of improvements and in terms of firestones position in the 
industry is equal in value and in cost to the urw settlement 
proposal 
we are hopeful that the union and company negotiators will be 
able to resolve their differences quickly allowing the plants to 
get back into operation he said

pope john paul ii celebrated the largest mass 
of his south american tour sunday with security provided by 20000 
soldiers and police after rebels set off explosions that plunged 
parts of lima into darkness 
the pope later denounced the violence poverty and other ills 
that he said made peruvian society seem like it was mined from 
within 
an estimated 15 million people gathered in a park on the 
outskirts of lima the nations capital for the outdoor mass 
hundreds of armed soldiers in full battle dress patrolled just 
below the altar while helicopters flew overhead 
the multitude chanted its welcome to the pontiff greeting him 
with a sea of yellowandwhite papal flags 
john paul wearing white and gold vestments appealed in his 
homily for the building of a civilization of love 
a civilization which resting on this foundation of love for 
the person who is near us our neighbor will transform the 
whole world he said 
in an altar ceremony before the mass john paul officially 
closed the fifth marian eucharistic congress a weeklong meeting 
of leading clergy from venezuela colombia panama ecuador peru 
and bolivia 
the government news agency andina reported that 3327 people 
were picked up by security forces in lima in connection with the 
popes visit it said they were detained on suspicion but gave 
no other details 
officials said insurgents were responsible for four dynamite 
blasts in lima saturday night shortly after john paul flew in from 
bolivia 
no one was injured in the explosions one was set off close to a 
bullfighting ring near a central square where the pope consecrated 
a statue of the virgin mary 
rebels also bombed towers and powerrelay stations in the andes 
mountains east of lima saturday night causing brief blackouts in 
the capital 
guerrilla violence by leftist groups has claimed more than 
10000 lives in the 1980s 
after the mass the pope addressed perus roman catholic 
bishops he said peruvian society often seemed mined from within 
by an unjustified eclipse in the required respect for human 
dignity 
he spoke of a blind and insensitive violence to repeated calls 
to reconciliation widening poverty drug trafficking and the 
growth of sects and persistence of doctrines that create 
confusion among the faithful and attack the unity of the church 
before retiring for the night in the vatican embassy the pope 
spoke to a group of intellectuals and businessmen he told the 
intellectuals not to confuse the churchs mission with mere 
earthly goals or political action 
he admonished businessmen to improve their workers living 
standards but also defended them saying often it is forgotten 
that you are men who confront risks and contribute to 
technological advance 
although the pope did not directly mention the problem of 
guerrilla activity at the mass he did refer to a bloody prison 
uprising by the maoist shining path rebel group in a taped message 
to inmates broadcast by peruvian radio sunday 
the army killed more than 250 guerrillas in putting down the 
revolt two years ago and john paul said i know of the painful 
tensions which have cost lamentable blood quotas and i know of 
your sufferings and needs which in spite of noble and generous 
efforts on the part of authorities have not been overcome 
troops and police in riot gear sealed off downtown lima and 
guarded public buildings and hotels 
heavy security was particularly evident when the pope paid a 
morning call on president alan garcia in the government palace 
as garcia a populist who has halted virtually all payment of 
perus 15 million dollar foreign debt led john paul through a 
garden they passed two armored personnel carriers soldiers 
carrying israelimade uzi submachine guns and a special 
antiterrorist team in red berets 
from the palace john paul traveled in his vehicle known as the 
popemobile to the campo san miquel mass site passing thousands of 
cheering and waving people along the sixmile motorcade route 
the pope was scheduled to leave peru on monday morning and fly 
to paraguay last stop on his south american tour that began in 
uruguay may 7 he was due to return to rome on thursday

the new york city ballets threeweek 35 
million american music festival which concluded sunday presented 
an array of new works of remarkably high quality any of which 
could enter the companys repertoire 
the festival with old ballets and 21 new ones by 18 
choreographers all danced to american music has been a smashing 
success surely greater than the company expected the new york 
state theater has been full for most performances and audiences 
have been enthusiastic 
the orchestras playing has not always been top drawer of 
course they had 21 unfamiliar pieces of music five of them 
commissioned for the festival to perform in three weeks and much 
of the music was modern and difficult 
dancers have looked outstanding throughout even in pieces that 
might have been allowed to slide through like george balanchines 
1954 western symphony 
the quality of the new ballets has been remarkably high since 
balanchines death in 1983 it has been obvious the company needs to 
add new works by a variety of choreographers a festival bringing 
in a lot of new works in a short time has proved a splendid idea 
even choreographers who used balanchines neoclassic dance 
vocabulary didnt create balanchine clones 
no premiere that we have seen couldnt enter the repertoire 
barber violin concerto by peter martins which used a couple 
from the new york city ballet and two guest artists from the world 
of modern dance was our favorite martins who directs the company 
along with jerome robbins choreographed four of the new ballets 
of the five dances we saw for the first time on the final 
weekend we most liked behind the china dogs a highly original 
ballet with distinctive elliptical lighting choreographed by 
william forsythe artistic director of the frankfurt ballet since 
1984 forsythe chose wellmuscled dancers solos looked crafted 
specially for each soloist 
music was composed by leslie stuck on an electronic emulator 
which allowed a pack of dogs to jam with two string quartets and 
a bowling ball some of the music and movement was jazzy and 
amusing unlike that of most of the other new ballets which were 
very serious 
violette verdy ballerina in the company from 1958 to 1977 
choreographed set of seven to 19th century romanticstyle piano 
music by mary jean van appledorn head of the music department at 
texas tech university we liked the music better than the dance 
miriam mahdaviani who joined the new york city ballet in 1980 
created a notable dance the newcomers to music by david 
diamond its in neoclassic style and keeps a charming sense of 
balance even when patterns arent actually symmetrical five 
soloists are introduced at unpredictable intervals through the 
ballet instead of making the usual measured entrances holly hynes 
used striking colors for the soloists leotards contrasting with 
the corps de ballet in white 
martins choreographed tearose in flowing balletic ballroom 
style to five george gershwin melodies that have never had lyrics 
michael tilson thomas played piano and conducted the final tune 
promenade sounds familiar because fred astaire and ginger 
rogers danced to it in shall we dance 
martins also choreographed black amp white to music by michel 
torke in which eccentric hand gestures looked gimmicky but then 
this perception may have been caused by the viewers ballet burnout

the navy had officially called off the search for the helicopter 
and declared the men killed in action memorial services later were 
held for the two americans in jacksonville nc where their unit 
was based 
the wreckage was located by a chartered salvage tugboat said

wreckage was found in the general location where the raids 
occurred they said 
the helicopter was on an evening patrol serving as backup for 
us combat ships the day it disappeared it was dispatched from 
the cruiser uss wainwright 
in their last dispatch the pilots radioed that they had 
detected hostile radar tracking their aircraft 
the iranians on april 23 claimed on their staterun radio that 
their revolutionary guards retrieved the some of the wreckage of 
the helicopter and brought it ashore 
the death of the two men brought to 46 the number of americans 
killed in and near the persian gulf in the past year the figure 
includes 37 killed in an erroneous iraqi missile strike on the 
frigate stark may 17 last year the others were killed in

members of congress are alarmed that a recent 
court ruling will strip away two centuries of legal protection for 
their official activities exposing them to lawsuits for monetary

the house legal staff notes that courts have previously chipped 
away at the immunity lawmakers were granted in the constitution to 
protect them from suits resulting from their activities on the 
floor and in committee 
but in a ruling involving rep don sundquist the legal experts 
say an appellate court has now left members of congress without a

pope john paul iis scheduled visit to

the pontiff was scheduled to arrive monday for a 57hour visit 
to this overwhelmingly catholic country the last stop on a 12day 
pilgrimage that has taken him to uruguay bolivia and peru 
perhaps the most politically sensitive stop the visit has

the steel industrys hardearned rebound 
is reviving the taconite mines of the mesabi iron range where 
skilled workers who were banished by layoffs years ago are suddenly 
in short supply 
the rare labor shortage has emerged as a call for help goes out 
to extaconite workers who fled as far away as arizona and florida 
during the industrys sevenyear recession 
they often are torn between remaining in their new jobs or 
returning to northeastern minnesota where family ties run as deep 
as the mine pits that helped fight two world wars by supplying ore 
to the nations steelmakers 
people want to come back home said tom gilpin placement 
interviewer for the minnesota department of jobs and training in 
virginia minn but i guess weve been burned so many times up 
here some of them just dont believe its going to last 
gilpin who is taking applications for jobs at ltv steel mining 
co in hoyt lakes said some former employees who were called back 
to work rejected the opportunity because they are secure in their 
new jobs but most miners some laid off for up to five years 
have returned 
im glad to see it said ed logan 32 of palo who was 
called back to work at ltv after being laid off nearly five years 
i didnt think id ever get called back but i guess i just kept 
hanging in 
logan said he eked out a living on the iron range working a 
variety of jobs during his extended layoff being single helped him 
avoid the fate of some of his married friends many of whom were 
forced to leave the area he said 
the decline of the taconite mines in recent years followed the 
slide in steel production taconite is a flintlike rock containing 
a lowgrade iron ore that is extracted and converted into pellets 
the pellets are then shipped to steel plants for smelting 
iron range taconite production peaked at 56 million tons in 
1979 and fell as low as 23 million tons in 1982 industry experts 
estimate 40 percent of the 25 billion worth of mining equipment 
in minnesota the nations largest producer of iron ore was idle 
in recent years 
taconite production in 1988 is projected at about 40 million 
tons up from 31 million tons in 1987 
al france executive director of the lake superior industrial 
bureau in duluth said the six working taconite plants on the iron 
range currently employ about 5000 people about 500 more than a 
year ago but well below the 1979 high of 15000 
eldon kirsch district 33 president of the united steelworkers 
of america in duluth said the rebound has been made possible by 
wage concessions and job consolidation 
its better now than it has been since 1980 kirsch said 
but that doesnt mean we have all our people back 
plants that operated with 500 in the past are operating with 
300 he added where there were 2000 workers now 1300 are 
employed 
most of the current hiring is taking place at the ltv plant in 
hoyt lakes where three shifts aim to produce 82 million tons of 
taconite pellets this year and at eveleth mines where a second 
production line is scheduled to begin july 1 after being idle since 
1982 
were wide open right now for the first time since 1976 
said jim kozar of ltv president of local 4108 of the united 
steelworkers of america 
kozar kirsch gilpin and others say there is an abundance of 
unskilled labor but a shortage of electricians with mining 
experience most iron range taconite producers ended apprenticeship 
programs for electricians in the downturn and many of the laidoff 
electricians have landed secure jobs in other places that they are 
afraid to leave they said 
were losing a certain number of them said bob raich 
personnel director at eveleth the supply of technical and craft 
people would be very very short right now if you were to start up 
a mining operation here 
kozar said the scaledback mining wage for electricians of about 
1150 an hour isnt helping to attract the top unexperienced 
electricians 
gilpin the state labor official said he has taken 3200 
applications for jobs at ltv mostly from unskilled workers he 
said he has placed about 200 applicants 
the offthestreet hiring is rare because it means the 
company has exhausted its reserve of laidoff workers gilpin said 
this is the first time they have come to us and said we need 
your help gilpin said 
stan daniels president of local 6860 of the united steelworkers 
of america in eveleth said its a shock to see the mining 
companies advertising in newspapers for workers and hiring 
unskilled workers off the street but its a welcome sight because 
it means that laidoff miners have had their shot at returning to 
work he said 
some of them have moved out sold their places and they are 
staying where theyre at daniels said but to others theres 
no place like home

after drifting through the shoal water of the 
1980s and sometimes running aground american steelmakers are happy 
to have deep water finally under the bow 
but where economic currents will carry them in the coming 
quarters is an open question 
business is booming said industry analyst charles bradford 
of the investment firm merrill lynch amp co nobody sees anything 
in their business that shows any sign of weakness but theyre all 
worried about it because of what they hear from their economists 
the industrys prospects will dominate discussions at the 
american iron and steel institute annual convention on wednesday 
and thursday in washington dc 
a combination of excess production capacity and slack orders 
hammered the industry between 1981 and 1987 steelmakers closed 
plants capable of making 30 million tons of steel per year 
eliminated about 220000 jobs and sustained losses totaling about 
12 billion 
in the process they modernized remaining plants and bargained 
new contracts two steps which by some estimates halved the labor 
needed to make an average ton of steel the industry also persuaded 
the reagan administration to limit steel imports through quotas 
negotiated with 31 countries 
now some plants are turning away orders because they dont 
want to stretch out delivery times too long your customers tend to 
get aggravated said wayne atwell an analyst for goldman sachs 
march shipments of 77 million tons were the most since june 
1981 and were up 21 percent from march 1986 previous estimates 
that 1988 shipments would total 70 million tons could be 
outstripped by 10 million tons 
some users cant buy enough metal 
just about everybody i talk to says they could sell more steel 
if they could get it atwell said 
usx chairman david roderick claims his company the largest us 
steel producer is now so competitive it could export more if we 
had more product available 
bradford doubts export opportunities are that bright but none 
of the analysts suggest that too many plants have been closed or 
that the approximately 170000 blue and whitecollar steelworkers 
left on the job are not enough 
if anything people think there still should be more 
production capacity cut bradford said 
the steel industrylost an absolute fortune over the last 
four or five or six years atwell said they had to raise 
prices to make a reasonable profit if part of that means shutting 
down capacityto meet normal demand but giving up some business 
at peak demand then thats realistic 
atwell said prices fell 15 percent over the five years after 
their 1981 peak various estimates say prices now recovered from a 
third to half of the decline and atwell expects prices to climb 
another 4 percent to 5 percent this year 
the industry turnaround bolstered by the weakening of the 
dollar helped bethlehem steel corp for example post a 1987 
profit of 174 million its first annual profit since 1981 
the thirdlargest producer had lost more than 2 billion in the 
interim and warned investors it might join secondranked ltv corp 
and smaller wheelingpittsburgh steel corp and sharon steel corp 
in chapter 11 reorganization 
ltv after losing 45 billion from 1983 to 1986 showed a 
profit of 502 million last year and 163 million in the 1988 first 
quarter this month the company unveiled a tentative plan for 
settling its 6 billion in debts and emerging from bankruptcy 
protection 
i see no reason at this point for this upturn in steel 
producing fortunes to change in the months and the quarters 
ahead roderick told usx shareholders this month 
a general economic recession seems to be the industrys largest 
worry many economists expect a downturn by late 1988 or in the 
next year or so 
several analysts also are concerned large steel inventories 
could lead to a drop in orders weaker prices and profit problems 
peter f marcus of the investment firm painewebber says the 
extraordinarily high production levels cited by national 
association of purchasing managers surveys are overwhelming 
evidence that steel users are building inventory 
bradford cites the steel service center institutes recent 
report of a record 68 million tons in inventory in march the 
institutes 400 members handle onethird of the nations steel 
but andrew sharkey president of the institute noted that daily 
shipping rats also were at record levels 
the market fundamentals are still pretty solid he said

britains three leading sunday newspapers reported 
a serious split between prime minister margaret thatcher and her 
two most senior ministers over economic policy and said mrs 
thatcher was under party pressure to heal the reported rift 
aides to mrs thatcher deny there is a split and insist the 
prime minister has no plans to reorganize her cabinet the domestic 
news agency press association reported after the sunday telegraph 
sunday times and observer all headlined the alleged dispute 
the papers said mrs thatcher was in dispute with nigel lawson 
chancellor of the exchequer and foreign secretary sir geoffrey 
howe a former treasury chief over the strengthening british pound 
the pound has risen strongly since march arousing concern that 
the resulting higher prices of british exports would damage british 
business and industry 
the prime minister is opposed to further intervention to curb 
the pound on the grounds that it is inflationary lawson advocates 
a stable exchange rate interest rate manipulation and central bank 
intervention howe made clear last week that he favors british 
participation in the exchangerate stabilization of the european 
monetary system 
mrs thatcher is facing mounting pressure to move sir geoffrey 
howe from the post of foreign secretary if she cannot resolve her 
seemingly intractable dispute with him and mr lawsonover 
exchange rate policy said the sunday telegraph 
the sunday times which like the sunday telegraph usually 
supports the thatcher administration said senior members of the 
governing conservative party were pressing mrs thatcher and lawson 
to issue a statement denying there was a rift 
no formal statement emerged but press association quoted 
unidentified aides as expressing mrs thatchers determination to 
discount the reports of friction 
it also quoted unidentified government officials as saying any 
clear statement by the prime minister on exchange rate policy 
likely would help speculators and that government policy was to 
keep the speculators guessing 
the liberal observer said mrs thatcher was facing a damaging 
public row with howe and lawson it also said the dispute had 
renewed speculation that the cabinet may undergo a shakeup this 
fall and that lawson might resign before the next budget is 
unveiled also in the fall 
the telegraph took the unusual step of running a frontpage 
editorial saying the dispute was not a crisis or a conspiracy but a 
case of mismanagement that lies with mrs thatchers insensitive 
behavior 
it said she had a tendency to antagonize senior ministers and 
appealed to her to forget about being the iron lady for a change 
and start showing the human touch 
none of the papers attributed their reports but aides to senior 
ministers are known to brief the mass circulation sunday press 
extensively 
the telegraphs assistant editor bruce anderson wrote in his 
column that mrs thatcher and lawson have managed to heal their 
differences but that howe remained on the outside 
the newspaper cited howes comments last week suggesting britain 
should reconsider its reluctance to join the european monetary 
system a mechanism for stabilizing exchange rates mrs thatcher 
is known to oppose british membership 
last week howe reiterated britains intention to join the 
monetary system when the time is right but added we cannot 
forever go on adding that qualification to the underlying 
commitment 
anderson said that remark was bound to bring howe straight 
into controversy and said howe and mrs thatcher often were at 
odds on other foreign policy matters

a growing pack of sellers for every car buyer has 
auto finance companies elbowing for advantage 
among the strategies being employed by the big three automakers 
are speedy loan approvals via computer and special incentives for 
new buyers such as college students 
home equity loans popular for home improvements are being 
offered to improve a house the auto companys way parking a new 
car in front of it 
and in some cases loan terms are being extended with one 
european company offering a 10year financing plan 
financing and pricing are the name of the game for about five 
years said charles l shillingburg analyst with the auto market 
research firm of jd power and associates 
general motors dealers are among those installing computers to 
get quick loan reviews from their credit subsidiaries 
you almost get an instantaneous response the dealer does 
from us said john andrews a spokesman for general motors 
acceptance corp gms financing arm 
the system spits back approval or disapproval and alternatives 
such as different terms for different length loans or lease 
possibilities 
i think it makes a lot of difference youve got a customer on 
the premises the dealer has given his best sales pitch you strike 
while the iron is hot andrews said 
ford motor credit corp is about halfway to its goal of 
installing computers in 3000 dealerships said executive vice 
president don cook 
for homeowners gmac says it will make credit available based on 
customers home equity interest on such a loan is tax deductible 
subject to restrictions relating to the original cost of the home 
and improvements that have been made said sarah wreford internal 
revenue service spokeswoman in detroit 
chrysler credit is trying home equity loans on a test basis but 
adoption is uncertain and numbers are really negligible at this 
point spokesman bob heath said 
the financing scramble can only intensify said analyst 
shillingburg with japanese makers stepping up us production and 
other manufacturers entering the market the number of car models 
available in the united states is expected to increase from the 163 
available in 1985 to as many as 235 in 1992 shillingburg said 
predicting japanese companies will form credit subsidiaries 
but the population only grows about 2 percent a year and the 
number of people owning three or more cars cannot be expected to 
increase greatly shillingburg said 
the markets maturity is one reason the big three are targeting 
the college crowd to attract new buyers gmac for example is 
offering graduates 400 in addition to rebates a model already 
carries and up to 90day deferral of first payments 
cutrate interest promotions are fading somewhat because of the 
cost to companies of absorbing the difference between low 
promotional rates and the going rates for capital but the impact 
of those programs has set up a scenario of continuing 
promotions shillingburg said 
european makers fighting price penalties that increased with 
the falling dollar are adopting that approach to push back into 
the market peugeot motors of america offered a 3000 tradein 
allowance for peugeot owners buying new 1988 peugeot 505 models in 
march the company expanded the offer to anyone owning or leasing 
any make of vehicle 
volvo announced in february it was cooperating with chase 
manhattan bank in new york to offer up to 10year financing through 
volvo dealers at rates from 1125 percent to 12 percent depending 
on locality 
by tuesday there were still only about 100 takers on the 
10year loans volvo spokesman bob austin said 
austin said they are designed for buyers wanting to keep monthly 
payments down though theyll pay substantially higher total 
interest over the term of the loan a buyer might plan to make the 
lower payments for a time and then sell the car for enough to pay 
off the remainder of the loan which carries no prepayment penalty 
austin said 
mercedes benz credit corp headquartered in norwalk conn 
began a program of nodownpayment four and fiveyear leases in 
the last week of march mercedes spokesman ab shuman said in new 
york 
more dramatic are the free roundtrip lufthansa or pan am 
airline tickets to stuttgart that mercedes offers buyers who take 
european delivery of their cars 
that offer is an attempt to revive the european delivery program 
that dropped from 2080 overseas deliveries in 1986 to 914 in 1987 
as terrorist scares cut tourism shuman said 
the customer pays a 2 percent import duty but tax currency 
exchange and other savings can amount to 3000 to 8000 
depending on the model shuman said

the manufacturing site for the saturn 
car lies between the towns of spring hill and columbia obscured 
from view by a manmade rolling hillside bordered by a bright white 
picket fence 
after saturn arrived both towns annexed land as close to the 
plant as possible to take advantage of the housing and commercial 
development that will follow the completion of a new parkway to the 
plant 
despite their neighborly proximity townspeople know little 
about what goes on inside the compound saturn officials say the 
town wanted them to place the plant out of view while their 
neighbors occasionally grumble that they are being intentionally 
shut out 
but saturn is intended to be a mystery a successful topsecret 
weapon against import cars general motors corp which funds 
saturn as a subsidiary rather than a division of the company 
expects the plant to turn a profit immediately said laurie kay a 
spokeswoman for saturn 
almost a fourth of the plant has been completed since 
construction began in june 1987 saturn plans to offer a family of 
saturn cars subcompact and compacts in 1990 for the 1991 model 
year ms kay said 
state legislators who visited the sprawling site in march viewed 
the halfcompleted powertrain building where car engines and 
transmissions will be built construction also has begun on three 
other buildings where cars will be assembled and painted before 
rolling off the line 
part of the plan to make saturn competitive with imports 
involves approaching production work differently and saturn 
officials along with their partners in the venture 
representatives of the united auto workers union are adopting 
management techniques developed by the japanese said ms kay 
employees will be involved in all aspects of production from 
understanding the cost of supplies to sales she said 
they will be on salaries rather than the traditional hourly wage 
rates with 20 percent of their pay based on the performance of the 
company ms kay said 
saturn jobs will first be offered to the estimated 300000 uaw 
members who have been laid off around the united states by gm said 
ms kay about 6000 people have applied for the 3000 jobs that 
are to be filled by mid1989 
the plant is designed to produce 250000 cars a year initially 
gm plans to increase production depending on the autos reception 
by car buyers 
saturn has begun reviewing about 1700 applications for a 
network of dealerships which are expected to reach 123 cities by 
the end of the first model year 
saturn has sent employees to japan to study japanese automaking 
procedures as well as to germany said ms kay 
were looking very hard at everything were not inventing 
everything she said 
we are taking a fresh look at what we do
