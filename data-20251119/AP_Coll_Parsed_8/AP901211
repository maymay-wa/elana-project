three irishmen were convicted 
tuesday of conspiring to buy a stinger missile for the irish 
republican army after a trial that prompted criticism from jurors 
of federal sting operations 
kevin mckinley of riviera beach seamus moley of toronto and 
joseph mccolgan of dundalk ireland were found guilty of two of 
five charges in us district court 
they were convicted of a conspiracy count that they attempted to 
obtain military weapons to use against british forces in northern 
ireland and attempting to obtain a stinger surfacetoair missile 
each was acquitted of three remaining charges attempting to 
transport an explosive in foreign commerce attempting to export 
defense articles without a license and violating the neutrality 
act 
the men who have been held without bond since january each 
face a maximum sentence of 15 years sentencing was set for feb 
22 1991 
jurors said they felt their hands were tied when us district 
judge jose gonzalez ruled they could not consider entrapment as a 
defense 
its a shame that the government spent tons of money to entrap 
these three guys who really werent looking for any trouble said 
juror fabio majia 
defense attorney fred haddad added if the judge had allowed 
them to consider entrapment these men would be on their way to the 
airport boarding a plane for ireland right now 
the governments case was based on the trios attempts to buy a 
stinger missile from undercover agents posing as arms dealers 
the defendants claimed they were with the ira and wanted to use 
the stinger to shoot down a british helicopter in northern ireland 
the government said 
federal agents showed them a realistic model of the stinger to 
see if they were serious about the deal the missile had a genuine 
infrared guidance system but no rocket fuel or explosives in the 
warhead 
the defendants then produced 50000 to buy the missile agents 
arrested all three jan 12 in palm beach county after mccolgan 
placed the missile in a car so he could ride away with it 
robert j creighton special agent in charge of the miami 
district for us bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms praised 
the conviction 
this will strike a significant blow against the irish 
republican army operations within the united states he said 
defense attorneys argued during the monthlong trial that 
government destroyed key tape recordings entrapped their clients 
and used a psychopathic gun nut as an informant 
prosecutors warned jurors to set aside any personal feelings 
about the historic conflict in ireland and consider violations of 
us law 
the ira is fighting to drive the british out of northern ireland 
and unite the protestantdominated province with the overwhelmingly 
roman catholic irish republic under a leftist administration more 
than 2800 people have been killed in political and sectarian 
violence in the province since 1969

crawl space in his apartment for 23 days beginning on oct 6 he 
said he ate only dry spaghetti 
kreuzman said he used a cordless phone to stay in touch with a 
network of about 100 people in hiding in kuwait through this

mention reactivating the military draft to 
lawmakers and they treat the term like a fourletter word 
the last thing we need is a draft said rep gv sonny 
montgomery dmiss chairman of the house veterans affairs 
committee and a senior member of the armed services committee 
the possibility of reinstituting the draft after a 17year 
absence has been raised in recent congressional hearings and 
editorial columns 
former military officials have suggested that if president bush 
decides to use military force to oust iraq from kuwait draft 
notices should go out immediately to avoid troop shortages 
lawmakers have questioned whether the pentagons decision to put 
a rotation policy on hold and wait before transferring forces in 
and out of the gulf region would require a draft 
by january us troops in the area will total more than 440000 
of the nearly 21 million active duty forces worldwide 
the selective service system remains in operation and all men 
must register with it within 30 days of their 18th birthdays but 
actual conscription ended in 1973 with the us withdrawal from 
vietnam 
members of congress with a powerful say on the issue however 
said in interviews last week that there is little or no support for 
a draft among their constituents at home or lawmakers on capitol 
hill 
it wouldnt fly anywhere it wouldnt get off the ground 
said montgomery a decorated army veteran of world war ii and the 
korean war 
montgomery best known as the father of the latest gi bill that 
expanded health education and housing benefits for military 
personnel said the allvolunteer force is doing the job 
the last thing we need is a draft there are still a lot of 
units to call up it would really put the country in uproar its 
really not necessary at all montgomery said 
two weeks ago the united nations backed a uscrafted 
resolution that authorized the use of military force to drive iraq 
from kuwait if president saddam hussein fails to withdraw his 
troops by jan 15 
sen john mccain of arizona ranking republican on the senate 
armed services subcommittee on manpower and personnel suggested 
that those mentioning a draft are using the issue to undercut 
bushs poliy 
people who are the opponents of action in the persian gulf are 
raising it as a straw man said mccain who believes the present 
us force is sufficient i dont think the american people want 
reinstitution of a draft and the specter would contribute to their 
reluctance to support the presidents policy in the persian gulf 
sen john glenn dohio chairman of the manpower and personnel 
subcommittee said he opposes a draft for now but that the united 
states must keep its options open if the crisis persists 
if bush finds it difficult to sustain a force of more than 
440000 in the gulf after a year either you cut a force of that 
size or rotate people glenn said if you dont want to cut at 
that point go to a draft either a major recruiting campaign or a 
draft 
rep norman dicks dwash a member of the house appropriations 
defense subcommittee said another situation a drawnout war in 
the gulf might require reactivation of the draft 
should hostilities break out and go on for a while i see a 
scenario where people start saying consider a draft dicks said 
he said the country does not have a large enough volunteer force 
to support a prolonged military operation the call for a draft 
then would come from congress not the military dicks said 
mccain contended however that reactivation of the draft would 
be an indictment of the volunteer force 
if this crisis drives us back to reinstitution of the draft 
and this is a midsize crisis then an allvolunteer force will 
have been a failure he said

the highly publicized soviet food shortage is most 
acute in big russian cities and seems milder in the countryside 
smaller cities and in nonrussian republics a survey indicates 
the situation is better here than in russia said povilas 
klimas deputy mayor of vilnius capital of the baltic republic of 
lithuania which declared independence in march were ready to 
go ahead on our own 
officials from the 12 cities surveyed by the associated press 
said there was more food in farmers markets than in state stores 
although prices were higher they blamed shortages on panicbuying 
and the collapse of the centralized distribution system which is 
not getting the harvest into cities 
president mikhail s gorbachev has appealed to the west for food 
to prevent winter unrest that he says may jeopardize his reforms 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze carried the plea monday to 
secretary of state james a baker iii 
gorbachev has said that much of this years harvest has been 
diverted from the state distribution system and sold privately he 
has called upon the kgb security police to make sure that western 
food aid is not siphoned off 
an ap telephone survey found that food was plentiful in the 
baltic republics and central asia and scarce in russia and two 
republics hit by ethnic unrest armenia and moldavia 
the survey found little fear of starvation in keeping with more 
thorough public opinion polls conducted by soviet sociologists 
in a poll published this week in the weekly newspaper moscow 
news 27 percentbelieved that mass famine would commence this 
winter compared with 57 percent who thought it unlikely 
the poll of 1363 people by the union center for public opinion 
and market research found that 58 percent expected widespread 
strikes which could aggravate the food shortage 
the ap survey found that several soviet cities have rationed 
food but it appeared to do little good where supplies were scarce 
as in leningrad the secondlargest russian city 
leningrad officials are trying to bypass the state distribution 
system and buy directly from bettersupplied regions said 
lyudmilla smirnova a city government spokeswoman 
food is plentiful but rationed in nearby tallinn capital of 
estonia another breakaway baltic republic said mikhtel pilving 
head of the city council secretariat 
the monthly ration for butter is 11 pounds and 44 pounds each 
for sugar and grains pilving said 
yes we have ration cards for vodka and other alcoholic 
beverages he said 
food supplies are better than last year in the central asian 
republic of uzbekistan said yuri kukarin editor of the uzbek 
information agency 
there is a shortage of meat in state shops but a wide variety 
in the markets and there is no problem with dairy products and 
butter he said 
although uzbekistan has one of the lowest per capita incomes in 
the soviet union there has been no need to introduce rationing 
kukarin said 
we pray that the ration card infection does not spread to 
us he said the situation is definitely much better than 
in other regions in the countryside there are more fruits and 
vegetables 
food was also reported to be plentiful in the european republics 
of byelorussia and the ukraine and the caucasian republic of 
georgia 
officials in the ukrainian capital of kiev have prevented 
panicbuying by paying 70 percent of salaries in coupons that can 
be redeemed for specific products said mikhail derimov editor of 
the newspaper pravda ukraini 
but the situation sounded grim in armenia which has yet to 
recover from the earthquake of december 1988 and a civil war with 
azerbaijan 
how can you ration something when there is nothing to 
ration said karen mikaelyan aide to the yerevan city council 
member responsible for commerce in the armenian capital ration 
cards have been introduced for butter cereals sugar cheese 
tobacco and coffee 
food supplies were fair but prices were four times 1989 levels 
in kishinev the capital of moldavia which was hit by ethnic 
unrest last month said valery rinitse deputy editor of the 
vechernaya kishinev newspaper 
the city committee against sabotage has found that food 
supplies sent to state stores mysteriously disappear he said 
it is sold to speculators then taken out of the city to other 
regions or to other republics where they sell it at higher 
prices 
besides cracking down on theft moldavian officials have been 
trying to buy food from bettersupplied neighbors 
this year well be eating potatoes from poland said 
rinitse

some of the electric cooperatives that are a 
mainstay of rural america are having trouble repaying billions in 
lowinterest government loans according to the head of the agency 
that issues the loans 
gary c byrne who has run the rural electrification 
administration since march said monday that the agencys lending 
program must be tightened to make it more responsible the rea 
part of the agriculture department has lent billions of dollars to 
rural electric cooperatives 
we have some difficult credit situations byrne said in his 
first meeting with reporters however he added im reasonably 
confident that were through the worst of the credit problems 
eight rural electric cooperatives are in default on 23 billion 
in loans from the rea four of the eight are in chapter 11 
bankruptcy reorganization the eight also owe 125 billion to 
private creditors 
only a few of the nations nearly 1000 electric coops are in 
serious trouble but the money problems have made some experts 
fearful of the reas financial health nearly all the coops 
nationwide have received lowinterest federal loans or federal 
guarantees for bank loans 
the financial troubles gripping some electric coops and their 
potential impact on the federal loan program were disclosed in an 
article by the associated press 
byrne the first banker to be appointed rea administrator said 
the outlook for coops will depend on the health of the economy and 
on the weather if the economy is weak or the weather is warmer 
than usual this winter he said demand for electricity and 
consequently the coops revenue would decrease 
byrne said the rea has adopted a strategy that includes steering 
financially healthy coops toward the private market for their 
loans and weaning them away from federal aid the agency plans to 
reduce the number of lowinterest loans it grants and replace them 
with loan guarantees 
in addition he said the rea needs to revise its lending 
policies to better distinguish between the coops with the greatest 
financial need and those less in need of federal funds 
the new approach does assure the american taxpayers that if 
the money is loaned out that money will be returned byrne said 
the rural electrification program set up in the mid1930s 
radically changed us agriculture by providing the cheap electric 
power that enabled farmers to modernize but critics complain that 
the program no longer serves a useful purpose and is a waste of 
taxpayers money 
the bush administration looking for ways to reduce the swelling 
federal budget deficit has mounted a quiet attack on the rea 
subsidies the office of management and budget in a recent memo to 
the energy department proposed phasing out all rea subsidies over 
10 years 
i think were going to be battling for funds over the next 
several years byrne said you keep the program strong by 
making the program financially responsible 
the biggest losses have been posted by big cooperatives that 
generate their own electricity most of the smaller coops which 
are members of the generating coops and only distribute 
electricity are in sound financial shape 
the rea has proposed new administrative rules that would among 
other things require the smaller distribution coops to guarantee 
loans made to their parent cooperatives 
byrne who was appointed by president bush to a 10year term 
formerly was chairman of the bank of alex brown in sacramento 
calif before byrne rea administrators had come from a farming or 
ranching background

the arrival of 1991 has been postponed 
the new year will be a second late to accommodate a leap 
second that will be inserted dec 31 to keep clocks in time with 
the earth 
the problem is that modern atomic clocks are too darn accurate 
they hardly vary at all being accurate to within a billionth of 
a second a day according to the us naval observatory the 
government office in charge of keeping track of what time it is 
the rotation of the earth on the other hand isnt nearly that 
consistent 
it speeds up a bit sometimes slows down other times 
our original clock the rotation of the earth is consistent to 
only about onethousandth of a second a day says the national 
institute of standards and technology the agency in charge of 
measuring units of time 
in the past slight irregularities in the earths rotation 
didnt matter 
but now the really accurate clocks get out of time with the 
slightly wobbly world and since the planet cant be adjusted the 
clocks must be 
because the earth as slowed a bit the clocks have been getting 
ahead of it they must be slowed down to keep them on time 
this years leap second will occur at 235959 universal 
coordinated time thats 659 pm and 59 seconds eastern standard 
time 
normally 65959 pm est is followed by 70000 but on dec 
31 of this year it will be followed by 65960 and that will be 
followed by 7 pm 
universal coordinated time formerly known as greenwich mean 
time is the international time standard 
the international agreement calling for the insertion of a leap 
second when needed was signed in 1972 this will be the 16th leap 
second added since then

british aid agencies say millions of people in the 
four corners of africa face starvation as early as january and 
some compare the situation to the ethiopian famine that shocked the 
world five years ago 
john magrath a spokesman for the oxfam charity said monday he 
had received a telex from a worker just back from the ethiopian 
province of eritrea 
terrible drought it said animals dying people already 
on the move 
oxfam has joined with six other agencies to form the british 
disaster emergency committee which is launching an appeal in the 
new year for funds to assist ethiopia the sudan mozambique 
angola and liberia 
the requests for help for africa come at a time when the 
european community is pulling together a 2 billion food aid 
program for the soviet union oxfam spokesman tony vaux noted 
a problem is building while the world is looking elsewhere 
he said 
the other participating agencies are the british red cross 
action aid christian aid the catholic fund for overseas 
development the save the children fund and help the aged 
announcing the appeal on monday the groups set no financial 
target but said they were appealing on behalf of victims of a 
major famine now threatening millions of people in many parts of 
africa 
the un food and agriculture organization has appealed for 13 
million tons of food aid for sudan 1 million tons for relief and 
the rest to replenish depleted stocks it said major and immediate 
relief is needed to avert calamitous famine 
mozambiques government says half of its 163 million people 
face deprivation or death because of food shortages aggravated by a 
15yearold civil war 
liberia is suffering food shortage compounded by the disruption 
of war in angola an estimated 19 million people are affected by 
food shortages 
oxfam workers john wilding and trish silkin said monday that 
they had found a neartotal crop failure in eritrea and severe crop 
failures in another civil warravaged ethiopian province tigre 
there will be a food crisis in eritrea as early as january 
unless there is an expanded program of relief said wilding who 
estimated that 25 million eritreans are at risk of death from 
hunger or thirst 
in eritrea wilding said there were no crops to assess there 
is an almost complete lack of grazing and livestock is in an 
extremely poor condition water levels are falling below the 
bottoms of many wells 
the situation is less severe in neighboring tigre wilding said 
but 22 million people need food aid he said 
ms silkin said the conditions in ethiopia were similar to that 
preceding the disastrous famine of 198485 when about 2 million 
africans died of starvation or faminerelated ailments about half 
of them in ethiopia 
the potential for the same situation is there she said but 
added that now there is an effective distribution system for food 
relief 
a report prepared for a world bank meeting in paris on monday 
said mozambique would need more than 1 million tons of food aid 
next year to stave off mass starvation 
massive direct emergency assistance is required now the 
report says 
the fao has promised 25000 tons of wheat 19000 of which have 
been delivered no other donors have made any commitments 
it is the second consecutive year of severe food deficits in 
sudan because of lack of rain 
the harvest also has been hindered in the south by a civil war 
that has killed hundreds of thousands of people in eight years and 
displaced many more 
estimates of the number of people at risk in the sudan vary from 
3 million to 11 million 
adam kellettlong of the british disasters emergency committee 
said the civil war in liberia was causing widespread famine and 
making it difficult to distributed aid 
reports we have say people are already starving there and some 
say up to 80 percent of the inhabitants have malnutrition he 
said 
a un relief program for angola began early in november after 
the government and rebels of the national union for the total 
independence of angola agreed to let the convoys pass

senior bush administration officials are 
considering suggestions ranging from a stiff gasoline tax to eased 
environmental rules as part of a blueprint for dealing with the 
nations future energy needs 
the national energy strategy has been in the works at the energy 
department for 18 months but it attracted increased attention 
after americas dependence on foreign oil was highlighted by the 
persian gulf crisis 
the department has put together 67 options for consideration by 
an interagency task force at the white house with a pareddown 
selection of proposals to be given president bush before christmas 
a draft energy plan is to be announced early next year 
many of the options already are under attack from 
environmentalists who say the administration is paying too little 
attention to energy conservation and too much attention to 
production at times at the risk of harming the environment 
theres no vision there is simply a long list of options 
christopher flavin an energy specialist at the worldwatch 
institute said of the proposals leaked so far 
all signs point to a policy that will reward and placate 
entrenched energy interests at the expense of conservation and 
development of renewable energy such as wind and solar said edwin 
rothschild energy policy director for citizen action a 
washingtonbased consumer advocacy group 
linda stuntz assistant undersecretary for policy and planning 
at the energy department said she expects the final plan to 
provide a balanced menu of both supply and demand proposals 
the energy strategy is hoped to allow bush to break the logjam 
for new energy initiatives in congress as he did in the area of new 
clean air legislation she suggested 
among proposals almost certain to be included in a final package 
are those aimed at streamlining regulations to ease the 
construction of nuclear power plants and the building of new 
natural gas pipelines officials say 
but some of the other proposals are thought less likely to 
survive 
these include a suggestion that congress impose a 
50centagallon gasoline tax set federal energy efficiency 
standards for new houses and require automakers to increase fuel 
economy of new cars to as much as 365 miles per gallon by the end 
of the decade 
to increase domestic energy production the proposals include 
tax credits for oil and gas drilling and opening federal lands 
including wilderness areas the arctic national wildlife refuge and 
parts of the outer continental shelf to energy exploration 
while those approaches have the administrations ear they are 
likely to meet strong opposition from environmentalists and 
lawmakers 
energy secretary james watkins made the national energy policy a 
priority when he took office in march 1989 the plan gained a fresh 
momentum after the iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
but ms stuntz expressed concern recently that public interest 
and political support for an energy program may wane once the gulf 
crisis and oil prices subside will the publics interest in a 
national energy policy remain the same if gasoline prices are back 
at 1 or so a gallon next summer she asked 
she and other energy department officials declined to discuss 
specific proposals although senior officials such as white house 
chief of staff john sununu have emphasized that the focus must be 
on measures driven by market forces and not new government 
regulations 
some of the options under consideration would require regulators 
to formally take energy impact into account whenever an agency 
considers new environmental regulations that may be viewed as 
attempts to bypass environmental requirements and reduce public 
oversight an energy department document 
among other proposals are 
an expansion of the gasguzzler tax on cars combined with a 
system of tax credits for buying fuelefficient vehicles 
incentives to promote alternative fuel vehicles including the 
government buying 60000 such vehicles and spending 10 billion 
over 10 years to establish 70000 retail alternative fuel outlets 
restructuring the utility industry to reduce the cost of 
electricity through increased competition

the federal railroad administration 
responding to a stream of sharp criticism from congressional 
investigators is redesigning its inspection system in an effort to 
assure the safety of us railways 
acknowledging deficiencies in the current inspection system fra 
administrator gilbert e carmichael said the changes will help 
assure continued public confidence in the safety of rail travel as 
the nation plans and builds a highspeed rail system 
the railroad administration has been the subject of four 
critical reports this year by the general accounting office the 
investigative arm of congress 
the reports requested by rep john dingell dmich chairman 
of the house energy and commerce committee concluded that the fra 
did not have enough hazardousmaterials inspectors and probably was 
deficient in other inspection areas 
these include inspections of track locomotive power and 
equipment operating practices and signal and train control 
in july the gao said the transportation department agency was 
not using available data to target routine inspections toward 
highrisk locations and toward railroads with poor safety records 
it said fra inspectors independently schedule their safety 
inspections without analyzing safety or accident data 
as a result railroads with increasing numbers of accidents 
did not receive additional inspection activity the gao said 
we found in many cases inspections decreased for railroads with 
increasing number of accidents 
the most recent gao report issued late last month took the 
review of the agency one step further 
fra does not know how many inspectors it needs to adequately 
cover the railroad industry the gao said fra does not 
know whether it has a sufficient number of safety inspectors to 
carry out its safety mission because fra has not developed 
inspection coverage standards 
carmichaels response is to redesign the inspection system a 
process he says will take 12 to 15 months 
at the end of that time id like to be able to say to the gao 
weve got the system in place go check it so congress will be 
comfortable and the public will be comfortable carmichael said 
at briefing last week 
dingell said that so far he is encouraged by the changes in a 
letter to transportation secretary samuel skinner he said i 
applaud the initiatives that you and gil carmichael have 
undertaken thus far to implement the recommendations 
carmichael said the changes are designed to improve the training 
of the 361 authorized federal inspectors and the 110 inspectors 
employed by state governments 
he said it also is aimed at ensuring that the inspectors are 
properly deployed that key areas such as the transport of 
hazardous materials are not neglected and that the statistics 
gathered to support the inspection system are timely complete and 
accurate 
carmichael said that when he became head of the fra at the 
beginning of the bush administration statistics were so poor that 
we didnt know exactly how many railroads there were in this 
country 
recordkeeping has improved and now he does there were 580 
railroads then now there are 605 an increase caused in part by 
large railroads spinning off their lines to small carriers 
perry rivkind carmichaels deputy said that when accidents at 
rail grade crossings and those involving trespassers on railroad 
property are discounted some 40 people a year lose their lives in 
railroad accidents 
compared with the 45500 killed in highway accidents in 1989 
alone it is obvious that railroads are an incredibly safe mode 
of transportation he said 
carmichael promised that statistics will be improved a 
comprehensive teaching and operations manual written for 
inspectors a training academy established standards for 
inspectors raised and the inspection staff kept at full strength 
through aggressive recruitment and hiring 
furthermore he said inspectors will be allocated to problem 
areas on a national basis previously he said the fra had a 
regional inspection plan with little uniformity on the national 
level or in the way the system dealt with problem areas 
carmichael said the transport of hazardous materials will get 
special priority although he stressed there has been no fatal 
accident in that area since 1980 
i live with a bhopal in the back of my mind he said 
referring to the december 1984 chemical leak at a union carbide 
pesticide plant at bhopal india that killed 3403 people and 
injured 20000

president bush does not plan to raise taxes to 
pay for operation desert shield and will ask congress next month 
for 12 billion to 20 billion to cover the troop deployment 
congressional officials say 
bush believes the overall costs of keeping more than 400000 
us troops in the persian gulf area for a possible confrontation 
with iraq will be as much as 30 billion in fiscal 1991 which runs 
through next sept 30 the officials said monday 
but the administration is counting on receiving at least 7 
billion from us allies to defray those expenses said the 
sources who asked not to be identified 
those figures would not cover the dramatically more expensive 
costs that would be incurred should war break out by one estimate 
fighting could cost 1 billion to 2 billion a day 
one congressional aide said the administration planned to send 
the detailed request to congress in late january 
under the fiveyear budget bill enacted last month possible 
expenditures for desert shield were left unlimited the government 
also was authorized to pay the expenses by simply borrowing the 
money 
some democrats in congress have said a temporary surcharge on 
income taxes might be necessary if fighting breaks out and costs 
soar 
according to the defense department kuwait has committed itself 
to contribute 25 billion the united arab emirates 1 billion 
japan 2 billion germany 11 billion south korea 95 million 
and saudi arabia an unspecified amount of food fuel water 
facilities and transportation assistance 
in september defense secretary dick cheney said he expected the 
years bill for keeping just more than 200000 troops in the gulf 
to not exceed 15 billion since bushs nov 8 announcement that he 
would double the deployment the administration has not publicly 
estimated the additional cost 
congressional aides said they were unsure whether the costs 
would double if the number of troops also doubled 
pentagon spending is increasing because of reservists who have 
been called up and because desert shield troops are receiving 110 
per month in hazardousduty pay they said 
however they noted many of the new troops are being sent to 
the middle east from bases in europe a shorter and cheaper trip 
than the journey from the united states many of the first soldiers 
made in addition the pentagon is not hurrying the extra troops to 
the gulf as it did the first wave 
if theres no rush to get there you can put them on ships 
that will take two weeks to get there but cost a lot less money 
than flying them one aide said 
last week robert reischauer director of the congressional 
budget office told lawmakers that it would cost about 12 billion 
for the 400000troop force to remain in the gulf for a year 
excluding contributions from allies 
house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif has said 
war with iraq could cost 1 billion to 2 billion daily 
but republican congressional aides have said they believe that 
figure is too high at a hearing last week reischauer told panetta 
that a 1billionperday price tag was wildly too high

third world countries foreign debt rose to 
1096 trillion this year up from 1051 trillion last year and 
from 786 billion in 1984 the central intelligence agency reports 
the figure does not include the soviet union china and other 
countries either still under communist rule or emerging from it 
such as those in eastern europe those countries add at least 
another 210 billion according to earlier estimates by the cia and 
the world bank 
the money is owed to more affluent governments including the 
united states japan and west germany to their private commercial 
banks and to intergovernmental bodies like the world bank another 
29 billion owed to the international monetary fund is listed 
separately 
although the cia reported a rise of 45 billion in the debt 
since last year it showed that payments dropped to 122 billion 
from the 126 billion of 1989 
for the debtors the payment level is more important than debt 
itself each dollar they save on payments to their creditors is a 
dollar they can spend on new foreign goods 
they can use foreign goods either to raise their peoples living 
standards or to invest in new equipment that will produce more 
goods and jobs for their rapidly rising work force 
the cia handbook includes information compiled from the world 
bank and the international monetary fund in washington the 
organization for economic cooperation and development in paris and 
the bank for international settlements in basel switzerland 
the book consists only of tables and does not explain the rise 
and fall of figures 
of the 113 countries listed the heaviest debt is reported for 
brazil 115341 billion up from 11215 billion in 1989 brazil 
also owes about 8 billion in back interest but the cia does not 
include such arrears in its figures they show brazil as paying 
101 billion on its debt this year compared with 119 billion 
last year and 161 billion the year before 
the new government of president fernando collor de mello is deep 
in negotiations with private banks to which it owes the bulk of 
its debt they are urging at least some payments on the back 
interest 
mexicos debt of 8802 billion is the second largest reduced 
under the plan of treasury secretary nicholas f brady last year 
it was 90789 billion mexicos payments also have dropped due to 
the new arrangement to 1006 billion this year from last years 
13104 billion

the navys a12 stealth aircraft program 
already under attack for cost overruns and schedule delays now is 
the focus of a criminal probe the defense department says 
the us attorney for the eastern district of missouri 
presently is conducting and directing a criminal investigation into 
the overpayment of progress payments the pentagons inspector 
general susan crawford said monday 
crawford made the disclosure at a house armed services committee 
hearing on the attack plane designed to replace the navys aging 
fleet of a6 intruders aboard aircraft carriers starting in 1995 
both the defense criminal investigative service which works 
for me and the naval investigative service are working in a joint 
fashion under the direction of the us attorney she said 
the planes contractors mcdonnell douglas corp and general 
dynamics corp are based in st louis 
the navy announced last week that it was removing three top 
overseers of the a12 program including two admirals for failing 
to disclose serious flaws in the aircrafts development 
five weeks after defense secretary dick cheney told congress in 
april that the program was on track it was disclosed that the a12 
was 18 months behind schedule and more than 1 billion over the 
planned 47 billion cost 
navy secretary h lawrence garrett told cheney last week that he 
was forcing vice adm richard c gentz commander of the naval air 
systems command to retire by feb 1 
garrett also said he was reassigning rear adm john f calvert 
the program executive officer for tactical aircraft programs and 
capt lawrence s elberfeld a12 program manager and writing each 
a letter of censure 
but garrett said he would not stop elberfelds scheduled 
promotion to rear admiral 
garrett testifying before the house panel monday faced 
criticism for that decision from rep andy ireland rfla 
i wonder what message you send when you include censure and a 
promotion as well ireland asked 
the message is already clear garrett responded 
that you can be promoted ireland interrupted 
the navy secretary argued that the promotion of elberfeld was 
based on his 20 years of service and the censure even with the 
promotion would be embarrassing and debilitating to elberfelds 
future career 
an internal navy report and the pentagon inspector generals 
investigation indicated last week that the government did not 
sufficiently challenge overly optimistic cost and schedule 
estimates of the contractors 
the navy report said mcdonnell douglas and general dynamics 
contract officials failed to tell the navy of cost and schedule 
problems 
garrett testified that briefings from the navys management team 
on the a12 program gave no indication of risk that the contract 
would not be completed within its ceiling price nor any risk that 
first flight and the followon test program would not be 
achieved 
the navy secretary blamed human errors in judgment for 
problems with the aircraft that were never reported he added that 
although the current procurement system works individuals find 
it very hard to push bad news up to the top

when nasa looks back to 1990 no one will sing 
it was a very good year but hey theres always 1991 
the space shuttle columbia which set records for giving trouble 
on the ground before the launch and in orbit afterward is home 
aftr encountering what nasa administrator richard truly called 
unbelievable difficulties 
launch crews and mission planners have a rest of more than two 
months before the next flight the first of seven scheduled for 
1991 that mission is to deploy unclassified payloads for the air 
force and the strategic defense organization 
columbias mission was the sixth and last for a shuttle in 1990 
a year of embarrassments for the national aeronautics and space 
administration 
in april the hubble space telescope was launched with fanfare 
but it later was found to be not nearly as sharpeyed as promised 
in may the first of five tries to launch columbia found the 
shuttle to be leaking dangerously that was fixed but during the 
mission science computers had to be shut down and so was the 
toilet then the threat of bad weather at edwards air force base 
forced the landing to be moved up by a day 
if we were in the business of constantly trying to make 
ourselves look good we would plan to achieve very little and then 
surprise everybody because we achieved twice as much truly said 
on monday as the astronauts were packing up a committee formed 
to make recommendations for nasa said the space agency should use 
the shuttle only when human presence is required in space the 
agency should put most of its efforts on science the panel said 
the space science program ranks above space stations 
aerospace planes manned missions to the planets and many other 
major pursuits which often receive greater visibility said the 
governments advisory committee on the future of the us space 
program 
the committee wants nasa to forego a fifth shuttle after the 
ship endeavour joins the fleet using the money saved to develop a 
heavylift rocket to use on all missions except those requiring 
astronauts 
it would add a mission from planet earth to explore space to 
the currently planned mission to planet earth which is planned as 
an allencompassing environmental study and the committee 
recommends a downsized cheaper space station devoted to life 
sciences and microgravity research 
the committee was formed as nasas embarrassments piled up 
earlier this year but norman augustine chairman of the 12member 
panel told reporters that nasa is neither as troubled as some 
suggest nor as good as it will have to be to carry out the program 
we have recommended 
he and truly differed on whether another shuttle should be 
built the agency boss said we should not give up the ability to 
build one if for any reason we need to build another one 
augustine however said its only a matter of time until the 
shuttle program has another disaster like the one that destroyed 
challenger and its crew of seven in 1986 
the planned 1991 missions include an april trip in which the 
gamma ray observatory is to be carried into orbit and in may a 
space life sciences laboratory is to ride aboard columbia 
discovery is to fly in july with another in a series of tracking 
and data relay satellites which gather information from other 
satellites and space shuttles and send it to the ground 
atlantis is to fly in august with several defense department 
payloads on a mission lasting 10 days discovery is scheduled again 
in november with the upper atmosphere research satellite and the 
final launch is that of atlantis in december carrying a manned 
scientific laboratory in its cargo bay

lithuanias president says the soviets have 
informed his government they will cut off shipments of food and raw 
materials to the breakaway republic beginning jan 1 
president vytautas landsbergis who met with president bush at 
the white house on monday told the associated press afterward the 
soviets are not characterizing the step as a renewal of the 
blockade imposed after lithuania declared its independence from 
soviet rule last march 11 
they are saying we have nothing for you landsbergis said 
in an interview and everything we would have gotten our 
portion is going to be divided up for everyone else nothing will 
be left for us 
he said the present dispute is over lithuanias refusal to go 
along with an economic plan that he said would return the republic 
to the control of soviet central planners and impose a soviet 
budget financial and tax system the kremlin also is demanding 
nearly all of lithuanias foreign currency revenues he said 
the soviets have given us an ultimatum he said since we 
are determined not to capitulate to the demands of that ultimatum 
we dont know what consequences await us after the end of this 
year 
the leader of the tiny baltic republic said lithuania is not as 
short of food as other soviet republics but that it could be very 
bad in the winter if the soviets cut all the supplies including 
the grain heating oil sugar as they did during the blockade 
he said he hoped his meeting with bush the first between a us 
and lithuanian president would result in the united states issuing 
a statement that will stay the hand of the soviets or even result 
in a pledge from the soviets that they are not going to use 
military or economic violence against us 
bush spokesman marlin fitzwater issued a statement monday 
calling for peaceful settlement of disputes between the soviets and 
the baltic republics 
the statement said bush expressed his hope that the soviet 
government would work constructively with baltic leaders without 
resorting to threats intimidation or the use of force 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze was scheduled to 
meet with bush in washington today and landsbergis said he was 
confident the subject would be raised 
the lithuanians export meat to their neighboring soviet 
republics but landsbergis said the threatened cutoff of feed 
grains would destroy our agricultural system in months 
he quoted a highlevel soviet official as boasting you will 
slaughter your animals this winter 
landsbergis said it was not clear whether heating oil and other 
petroleum products also would be cut off 
lithuania was practically brought to its knees earlier this year 
when the kremlin imposed a tough economic embargo in an effort to 
force the republic to halt setting up its own border controls and 
taking other steps to establish its independence from the soviet 
union 
the embargo was halted when lithuania agreed to suspend steps it 
was taking unilaterally and enter into negotiations with the soviet 
union toward establishing the republics eventual independence 
little progress has been reported in getting the talks underway

scientists say pictures of the far side 
of the moon taken by the spacecraft galileo will help fill a blank 
spot on the map of the planet 
the pictures taken as galileo sped past the moon and earth on 
its sixyear voyage to jupiter also should reveal more about the 
mineral content of the moons crust scientists said monday 
were actually doing some new observation said james head 
a member of galileos imaging team at nasas jet propulsion 
laboratory 
the national aeronautics and space administration displayed 
black and white photos of the full moon that provided a sharp image 
of the orientale basin as well as portions of both the near and far 
sides of the moon 
the spacecraft swung into the earths gravitational field 
saturday hurtling 597 miles above the western atlantic at the 
point of its closest approach 
by sweeping near earth galileo was able to use gravitational 
pull like a slingshot to increase its speed by 11600 mph boosting 
its velocity to 79000 mph in relation to the sun 
galileos approach allowed scientists to focus the crafts 
cameras on the far side of the moon for the first exploration of 
the region since nasas apollo missions in the 1970s 
the cameras photographed a wedge of moonscape near the south 
pole on the far side that somehow was missed by previous us and 
soviet mapping missions said project scientist torrence johnson 
thats interesting its got craters just like the rest of the 
moon but theres no great scientific surprise in that johnson 
said 
a subsequent journey through the earths magnetic field gave 
scientists their first measurements of a solar storm in which 
magnetically charged ions take on higher energy levels 
the data could reveal whether the majority of these ions which 
trigger colorful auroras near earths magnetic poles come from the 
sun or earth said lou frank chairman of galileos magnetic field

prepared for congress 
the post office cut back some overnight delivery areas in july 
saying the changes would save money and improve efficiency the 
agency said the changes would slow delivery of only about 5 percent 
of firstclass mail 
the change could slow delivery of as many as 43 billion pieces 
of mail over a year according to the report by the house 
government operations committee and titled just say slow 
in 1989 the post office carried 858 billion pieces of 
firstclass mail five percent of that would be 43 billion 
the report issued monday said the postal service implemented the 
change without demonstrating that it would lead to any improvement 
for the public

standards rep bob wise dw va said in a statement

a federal safety official wants a national 
campaign to persuade 21 states to pass laws to confiscate the 
licenses of drivers who fail or refuse drunkendriving tests 
james l kolstad chairman of the national transportation safety 
board told a meeting of the national commission on drunk driving 
that license confiscation is a simple direct and inexpensive 
way to attack a problem blamed for 60 deaths a day or nearly 22000 
fatalities a year 
such laws already have been passed by 29 states and the district 
of columbia and kolstad said monday they have resulted in 
substantial decreases of drunken driving 
kolstads proposal recently listed as one of the safety boards 
mostwanted safety changes would require the immediate 
confiscation of a license if a driver either fails a sobriety test

a woman whose surgeon later died of aids has 
filed a 32 million lawsuit against the doctors estate and johns 
hopkins hospital 
the lawsuit filed monday in baltimore circuit court claims that 
dr rudolph almaraz was obligated to tell patients of his disease 
and that the hospital should have known he had the fatal virus 
an identical claim was filed with the state health claims 
arbitration office which handles malpractice cases 
the lawsuit is the first filed against almaraz estate and the 
hospital since it was disclosed 1 weeks ago that he died nov 16 
of acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
perry mahoney rossi and her husband dennis t rossi seek a 
total of 32 million in compensatory and punitive damages 
in november 1989 almaraz removed a nonmalignant lump from mrs 
rossis breast she said she felt panic horror and fear when 
she learned the surgeon died of aids 
i wish dr almaraz had told me and i could have had the option 
of walking out the door mrs rossi said thats not the option 
i was given he took that choice away from me 
mrs rossi has had an aids test but does not know the results 
the hospitals attorney paul rosenberg refused to comment on 
the lawsuit saying he had not seen it 
almarazs worked at the hospital for six years and performed 
surgery on about 1800 patients 
the rossis lawyer jonathan schochor said the law requires 
informed consent from a patient 
the man was operating at this institution for years 
schochor said in our opinion they should have known that he 
had aids 
almaraz closed his practice last march and resigned from the 
hospital june 30 
his lawyer said almaraz apparently contracted aids from one of 
his patients 
almarazs widow betty said her husband took precautions to 
avoid infecting his patients 
experts say the risk of doctors passing the virus on to their 
patients is small

a florida man trapped in kuwait by iraqi 
invaders hid for 23 days with his dog in a tiny crawl space eating 
only uncooked spaghetti a new mexico man defended his hideout 
with a machete killing an intruder 
a freed baltimore man told of watching a kuwaiti man gunned down 
by a platoon of iraqi soldiers the family of a missouri man who 
endured four months in hiding plans to burn his passport so he 
cant leave the united states again 
tales of captivity ranged from those who cringed inside darkened 
apartments in terror to a hostage held in a kuwaiti royal palace 
who ate off fine china and drank from goldrimmed crystal goblets 
tom kreuzman of holiday fla hid with his yorkshire terrier 
chu chu in an apartment airconditioning duct about 8 feet long 
and 3 feet wide for more than three weeks before kuwaiti friends 
moved him to a safe house 
kreuzmans homecoming joy monday was tempered by sadness for the 
dog that didnt make the flight home 
its a tragedy he said she went through a lot with me 
over there 
he had crated his pet and put her on the plane in kuwait at 
baghdad i wanted to go down to cargo and give her some water but 
was told no said kreuzman 38 we got to frankfurt the box 
was smashed and no dog was in sight 
master and dog descended from the crawl space for only about 
five minutes a day kreuzman never cooked fearing the smell might 
alert occupying troops he said the dog never barked or made a fuss 
that might give them away 
donald latham 50 of albuquerque returned home with his 
stepfather eugene hughes 69 after a harrowing stay in kuwait 
marked by the slaying of a burglar 
we had a palestinian break into our house and i killed him 
with a machete latham said 
he said marauding iraqi troops had entered the apartment earlier 
but did not find the men they stole our television the blender 
one watermelon and about half our food he said 
the captives returned home after iraqi leader saddam hussein 
decided to release the many foreigners held since his forces 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 
one man hiding in kuwait experienced the carnage of war 
firsthand 
the worst thing i personally witnessed was a kuwaiti being 
shot by probably 20 iraqi soldiers said ed werner of baltimore 
the guy was crawling on the ground across the street he fired a 
shot and about 20 iraqi soldiers just opened up on him 
stories of iraqi soldiers torturing and murdering kuwaitis were 
common 
im a veteran of vietnam but theres nothing in vietnam that 
scared me the way this did said robert morris a dentist from 
milton mass who returned home monday night these people that 
came down were barbarians 
they took everything they pillaged the country they raped 
the women constantly they are killing the doctors morris 
said 
jack rinehart of stover mo who took refuge in the us 
embassy in kuwait wasnt likely to travel abroad anytime soon 
were definitely going to have a passportburning party hes 
not going to leave the good old usa again said rineharts 
sister sue iliff of stover 
robert vinton 58 of santa fe nm was held as a human shield 
at a petroleum refinery south of baghdad and said conditions there 
were like a prison camp including barbed wire 
we really couldnt leave vinton said basically we were 
in a total prison with bars on the windows they locked the doors 
at night 
in a stark contrast to that isolated deprivation dave lammel 
42 of orinda calif was held at a kuwaiti royal family palace 
using the limoges china and crystal glassware kept there 
i had the irony of living in these ungodly opulent 
conditions he said it was bizarre it was like a fellini 
movie

third world countries foreign debt rose to 
1096 trillion this year up from 1051 trillion last year and 
from 786 billion in 1984 the central intelligence agency reports 
the figure does not include the soviet union china and other 
countries either still under communist rule or emerging from it 
such as those in eastern europe those countries add at least 
another 210 billion according to earlier estimates by the cia and 
the world bank 
the money is owed to more affluent governments including the 
united states japan and west germany to their private commercial 
banks and to intergovernmental bodies like the world bank another 
29 billion owed to the international monetary fund is listed 
separately 
although the cia reported a rise of 45 billion in the debt 
since last year it showed that payments dropped to 122 billion 
from the 126 billion of 1989 
for the debtors the payment level is more important than debt 
itself each dollar they save on payments to their creditors is a 
dollar they can spend on new foreign goods 
they can use foreign goods either to raise their peoples living 
standards or to invest in new equipment that will produce more 
goods and jobs for their rapidly rising work force 
the cia handbook includes information compiled from the world 
bank and the international monetary fund in washington the 
organization for economic cooperation and development in paris and 
the bank for international settlements in basel switzerland 
the book consists only of tables and does not explain the rise 
and fall of figures 
of the 113 countries listed the heaviest debt is reported for 
brazil 115341 billion up from 11215 billion in 1989 brazil 
also owes about 8 billion in back interest but the cia does not 
include such arrears in its figures they show brazil as paying 
101 billion on its debt this year compared with 119 billion 
last year and 161 billion the year before 
the new government of president fernando collor de mello is deep 
in negotiations with private banks to which it owes the bulk of 
its debt they are urging at least some payments on the back 
interest 
mexicos debt of 8802 billion is the second largest reduced 
under the plan of treasury secretary nicholas f brady last year 
it was 90789 billion mexicos payments also have dropped due to 
the new arrangement to 1006 billion this year from last years 
13104 billion

the international team of editors deciphering the dead sea 
scrolls has voted to remove the projects chief editor who has 
been criticized for the slowness of the work to publish the ancient 
documents a team member said 
the dismissal of john strugnell of harvards divinity school 
comes just a month after the scholars appointed a cochief editor 
to share strugnells duties 
the scholars voted last week to dismiss strugnell because of 
health problems for which he recently was hospitalized frank cross 
said friday 
cross of harvards near eastern languages and civilizations 
department belongs to the original group of eight scholars who 
were given exclusive publishing rights to the scrolls in the 1950s 
the group has since been expanded to between 10 and 15 scholars 
worldwide 
the dead sea scrolls discovered in 1947 in a cave in what is 
now the israelioccupied west bank contain the oldest known copies 
of the old testament other biblical writings ancient literature 
and poetry they are kept at the rockefeller museum in jerusalem 
between 35 percent and 45 percent of the documents remain 
unpublished strugnell said in a november interview 
strugnell has been ineffective as chief editor because he has 
not pushed researchers to work faster so the scrolls can be 
published in their entirety cross said in a telephone interview 
last month 
there has been criticism both inside the team and out 
cross said in november it is not by chance that this move is 
being made 
cross said friday that strugnell has been hospitalized but was 
unsure where 
a harvard spokesman monday refused to disclose strugnells 
whereabouts saying strugnell had instructed him not to speak to 
anyone spokesman peter costa also said he didnt know if strugnell 
was aware of the vote to dismiss him 
i cant confirm or deny anything costa said at the 
university we consider this to be private he declined to 
elaborate 
cross said strugnell will remain in the group researching the 
scrolls but will no longer have administrative responsibilities 
three scholars in the team will replace strugnell as general 
editors and emmanuel tov of jerusalems hebrew university will 
handle the projects administrative work cross said 
the scholars in october chose tov to become coeditor in chief 
of the group deciphering the scrolls hoping to speed up the work

columbia glided to a rare 
night landing a day early after a stargazing mission plagued by 
computer problems clogged plumbing and finally the threat of rain 
the shuttle touched down monday night its signature twin sonic 
booms heralding its arrival over the mojave desert the landing 
seen by about 600 spectators was moved up to avoid rain in todays 
forecast 
nasa officials focused on the missions accomplishments despite 
repeated problems aiming the 150 million astro observatory 
besides the telescope troubles the crew had to repair a clog in 
the shuttles waste collection system 
i think weve had a resounding success on the mission said 
william lenoir nasa associate administrator 
it was the fourth shuttle landing at night 
columbia carried astro made up of three ultraviolet telescopes 
and a separate xray telescope in its payload bay 
problems with an automatic pointing system had forced astronauts 
and ground crew to manipulate the ultraviolet telescopes by hand 
drastically slowing the process 
during the nineday mission the crew succeeded in pointing the 
ultraviolet telescopes at only 135 of 250 targets including a 
comet heading out of the solar system 
the mission originally scheduled for 1986 was delayed by the 
challenger explosion and later by repeated hydrogen fuel leaks 
the landing came the same day the space agency received a 
critical review by a government panel that said nasa should end its 
dependence on the troubled space shuttle fleet and completely 
redesign a planned space station 
the advisory committee on the future of the us space program 
also said nasa could improve by streamlining management 
nasa assembled the outside review at the request of the bush 
administration after a rash of embarrassments that included the 
grounding of the shuttle fleet because of hydrogen leaks and a 
mirror flaw in the hubble space telescope 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze toured the 
johnson space center in houston space center on monday with 
secretary of state james a baker iii and spoke to the columbia 
crew in remarks translated from russian 
what you are doing in space is very important you are paving 
new roads in space and i very much believe that you are paving 
those roads for the benefit and for the happiness of all of us on 
earth shevardnadze said 
astronaut jeffrey hoffman responded with a few russian phrases 
then said in english we agree with your sentiments that space 
travel is important for the future of all mankind 
nasa said it was the first communication between a soviet 
official and a shuttle crew in space 
after the smooth landing the seven columbia astronauts were to 
stay overnight at edwards before traveling to houston today 
more than 1000 telescope photographs were made during the 
flight the first photographs should be ready for viewing in late 
december or january 
nasa scientists were encouraged by the final observation made by 
the ultraviolet telscopes a study of comet levy the comet could 
not be studied earlier in the flight because it was too close to 
the sun 
what a thrilling way to go out astronomer paul feldman of 
johns hopkins university said mission scientist ted gull said 
it brought tears to my eyes

for four months the priority has been freedom those trapped in 
kuwait and iraq have above all focused on escaping with their 
lives 
but in the months to come some of the 900 newly freed us 
hostages will have to start over without the homes jobs and in 
some cases friends they lost to saddam husseins invading troops 
its not easy to pick up and start over like this patricia 
hammer said monday from denver im 42 years old and living with 
my mother 
ms hammer fled kuwait five weeks after iraq invaded aug2 but 
her exhusband refused to let her take their two children after 
eight years building a life and family away from the united states 
she now feels very much alone 
theres a lot of problems coming out ms hammer said 
youre physically weak emotionally upset these people will be 
traumatized 
for many former hostages the journey back to normalcy will not 
end when theyve arrived safely in america 
my life is still not back together and it wont be for a 
while said miles hoffman who was released last month after 
being wounded by iraqi troops 
hoffman has been in a perpetual rush since returning to 
columbus ga his injured arm needed medical attention the media 
needed interviews worried friends and relatives needed reassuring 
and kuwait still needs to be liberated 
hoffman and his british fiance nikki murgatroyd initially put 
off their wedding until all saddam husseins hostages were 
released 
now she tells me she wont marry me as long as im married to 
the free kuwait effort said hoffman a financial analyst for 
the kuwaiti government i need time to catch up 
hoffman however figures he may have it better than some of the 
american hostages that were headed out of iraq and kuwait on 
monday less than a week after saddam decided to free his foreign 
guests 
i have a sense of purpose and my job hoffman said 
you just have to put your life in order and get on with it the 
thing is some hostages are going to have a hard time doing that 
some people lost it all when iraq invaded kuwait bob peek his 
wife and children like many of those who had established lives in 
kuwait have had to start over from scratch 
its hard to imagine that all i had was my suitcase 
said peek 37 who worked for the defense ministry in kuwait left 
behind were his family car their entire household souvenirs 
snapshots and a lot of arab friends 
also left behind was their bank account 
getting back into the swing of the states isnt bad said 
peek who has moved his family to midland texas and started work 
for a small oil company the problem is that with the economy 
being what it is today its hard to find something 
after these people come home after theyve spent some time 
with family and adjusted to their freedom theyre going to hit the 
job market he said and i just wonder what theyll find 
since fleeing kuwait with her three young children ruthie 
alqallaf has traveled around the nation giving speeches on behalf 
of washingtonbased citizens for a free kuwait 
she is doing it to keep her mind occupied to stave off her 
despair at having lost everything and she is doing it for her 
husband a kuwaiti air force major iraqi troops had shot seven 
members of his family by the time her husband who is now in saudi 
arabia escaped in october 
im bitter im angry i feel sad mrs alqallaf said from 
memphis tenn but ive only lost my home the kuwaitis have 
lost so much more

for years people erroneously thought 
billionaire armand hammer was connected to the company that makes 
arm amp hammer baking soda 
irked by the constant questions hammer finally worked out a 
deal in 1986 that gave his occidental petroleum corp a 5 percent 
stake in the baking soda company and him a seat on its board 
hammer often said he was named after armand duval the hero in 
camille a play by alexandre dumas that was one of his fathers 
favorites

perpich was tagged governor goofy about a year ago when he 
responded to news media accounts of his lifestyle by proposing to 
sell the governors mansion dismiss his state patrol driver and 
give up his luxury car 
the governor lashed out at carlson for his suggestion that 
perpich solve a projected 197 million state budget shortfall and 
help ease a projected 12 billion deficit in the next twoyear 
budget 
you have hired only one staff person and are relying on 
lameduck administrators to make your decisions perpich wrote in 
one of three letters to carlson thats not the type of 
leadership most minnesotans were looking for during the recent 
election 
perpich missed the swearingin ceremony for supreme court chief 
justice am sandy keith on nov 30 his absence was striking 
because he had named keith a longtime friend to the high court 
and last summer selected him to become chief justice 
keith said the governor had called him shortly after the 
election to complain about a supreme court decision perpich said 
led to his defeat 
the 52 ruling with keith in the majority cleared the way five 
days before the election for carlson to replace jon grunseth as the 
gop candidate on the ballot sexual impropriety allegations forced 
grunseth from the race 
perpich spokesman ray bohn said the governor missed keiths 
swearingin ceremony because he had previous commitments 
some perpich allies said the governor is handling his defeat 
well retiring minnesota aflcio president dan gustafson said hes 
spoken with perpich a couple of times since the election 
he hasnt been bitter gustafson said hes been a little 
hurt and naturally so this is a real tender guy and hes never 
been vindictive that doesnt mean he cant get mad and angry

the tamil tiger rebel group has 
accused government troops and members of a rival tamil group of 
dragging 76 tamil men out of their cars and homes and massacring 
them in eastern sri lanka 
military officials and a spokesman for the rival group denied 
the allegation today but residents of a nearby town said they had 
heard reports of a massacre from people who fled the area 
the residents speaking on condition of anonymity said they 
were told some people had been shot to death while others were 
burned alive with blazing tires around their necks 
in another development military officials said the tigers had 
ambushed a military patrol today near the northeastern port of 
trincomalee killing five ethnic sinhalese soldiers 
some rebels were thought to have died in the 90minute gunbattle 
that followed the ambush the officials said they gave no numbers 
the tigers in a statement issued by their office in london late 
monday night claimed a terrible massacre was carried out 
friday by sri lankan army troops from an army camp at neelavenai 
the tigers accused a rival group the tamil eelam liberation 
organization of collaborating in the alleged massacre 
military officials in colombo denied their men were responsible 
for any such killings 
the officials said the tigers often made such statements in an 
attempt to justify upcoming attacks on the army or sinhalese 
civilians 
tamil guerrillas launched a violent separatist campaign against 
the countrys sinhalese ethnic majority and sinhalesecontrolled 
government in 1983 more than 14000 people have died during the 
insurgency 
the tigers statement claimed 76 tamil men were killed at 
neelavenai 9 miles south of the eastern coastal town of 
batticaloa the statement listed names and ages of 14 purported 
victims but gave no details of the others it alleged were killed 
senathirajah lawrence spokesman for the tamil eeelam liberation 
organization denied his group had anything to do with a massacre 
lawrences group was once allied with the tigers but says its 
men have given up armed struggle in favor of a political solution 
we dont operate anywhere near the neelavenai village 
lawrence said when contacted by telephone in colombo this is a 
canard spread by the tigers 
residents of batticaloa 135 miles east of colombo said tamils 
who fled neelavenai reported that about 70 people were killed the 
residents contacted by telephone said they were not sure who was 
responsible 
the tigers broke a ceasefire with the government six months 
ago after several offensives the government controls batticaloa 
and other major towns in the east the tigers still operate in the 
jungles and are in control of the northern jaffna peninsula 
the tigers say sri lankas tamil minority needs a separate 
homeland to protect it from discrimination by the sinhalese in jobs 
and education sinhalese make up 75 percent of the island nations 
16 million people

after suffering a bruising defeat in 
national elections the leadership of the opposition social 
democrats has unanimously chosen the premier of a northern state to 
be the partys new chairman 
the nomination of bjoern engholm ended a weeklong search for a 
new leader to renew the party which has been dealt three 
successive electoral defeats at the hands of chancellor helmut 
kohls christian democrats 
both chancellor candidate oskar lafontaine and current party 
chief hansjochen vogel had declined to lead the social democrats 
after the defeat in the dec 2 parliamentary vote 
the social democrats are the countrys second largest political 
force and the oldest political party in germany 
but with lafontaine as chancellor candidate and vogel at the 
head of the party they won just 335 percent of the vote 
nationwide in the first free elections in united germany in 58 
years 
the leftleaning party fared poorly winning about 23 percent 
in the five new eastern states that were carved out of east germany 
following unity on oct 3 
the cautious 51yearold engholm dubbed the beautiful 
bjoern for his dapper dressing is a study in contrast with the 
harsh outspoken lafontaine 
as kohls push for speedy german unity accelerated this year 
lafontaine alienated voters by issuing negative statements about 
unity engholm said he found lafontaines style offputting 
engholm told zdf television his task would be to bring the 
social democrats back to the center of society he said that he 
would consult with leading artists and intellectuals on the partys 
future course 
engholm indicated he would retain his elected office as premier 
of germanys northernmost state largely rural schleswigholstein 
vogel said the party leadership had unanimously agreed on 
engholms nomination as chairman the candidacy must be formally 
approved at a party congress scheduled for may lafontaine has 
remained out of view since losing the election 
engholm said he wanted to bring a new generation of social 
democratic politicians to the forefront in time for 1994 
parliamentary elections 
an education minister under the former west german government of 
helmut schmidt he has already proven his own electoral resilience 
in 1987 engholm was the victim of a smear campaign while 
running for premier of schleswigholstein 
christian democrat uwe barschel won the vote but resigned 12 
days later after an aide revealed he was ordered to leak claims 
that engholm cheated on his taxes and was bisexual 
a day before barschel was to have appeared before an 
investigatory panel he was found dead in a geneva hotel an 
apparent suicide 
engholm was elected state premier in new elections on may 1988

the citys board of supervisors has given 
initial approval to what could become the nations only active law 
regulating video display terminals in the workplace 
the measure tentatively approved monday would require employers 
with 15 or more employees to provide adjustable work stations 
mandatory 15 minute breaks and safety education for workers 
private and government offices would have two years to comply 
with the vdt safety rules if the ordinance is approved a second 
time by the supervisors and signed by mayor art agnos 
this is the new age of safety and health legislation said 
supervisor nancy walker 
she compared the vdt safety ordinance to landmark laws at the 
turn of the century that set work standards such as eighthour days 
and compensation for overtime 
we are once again on the cutting edge of something that others 
have been unable to do she added and were taking heat from 
that 
the only other such ordinance in suffolk county ny was 
successfully challenged by business owners who said only the state 
could impose such rules 
the san francisco ordinance passed 81 supervisor tom hsieh 
cast the lone dissenting vote saying it was too costly and more 
information on vdt problems should be gathered 
the national institute for occupational safety and health said 
vdt workers often suffer headaches general malaise eye strain and 
musculoskeletal problems caused by poor work station design that 
results in awkward hand head and limb positions 
pacific bell operator becky hogue who wears wrist braces said 
repetitive strain injuries cause debilitating pain 
its been frustrating because my bosses basically dont believe 
im hurting said hogue 30 maybe this ordinance will force 
people to do something they should be doing anyway 
under the ordinance vdt operators would get a 15minute break 
every two hours work stations would have to have proper artificial 
lighting and be out of direct sunlight adjustable swivel chairs 
and document holders must be provided computer terminals would 
have to have detachable keyboards and adjustable nonglare 
screens among other safety features 
additionally businesses would have to provide workers at their 
request with arm wrist and foot rests that aid in proper 
placement of limbs and joints while working on a vdt 
jim lazarus vice president of the san francisco chamber of 
commerce said the business group opposes the ordinance because it 
would cost too much to comply especially during an economic 
downturn 
city budget analysts estimate it would cost san francisco about 
16 million to retrofit vdt work stations private businesses 
would probably pay some 36 million to comply with the ordinance 
they said

cigarette smoking appears to increase the 
risk of developing leukemia and kicking the habit may not be 
enough to dodge the dreaded blood disease a study says 
paul k mills a professor at loma linda university and the 
principal author of the study said research suggests that even 
former smokers are at high risk 
its very discouraging mills said monday we saw a strong 
association between prior cigarette smoking and the risk of 
developing leukemia 
the studys results are being published this month in the 
journal of the national cancer institute 
cigarette smoking also has been linked to cancers of the lung 
bladder pancreas esophagus throat and cervix 
the study is part of the adventist health study a major 
epidemiological investigation of the causes of various cancers 
among california members of the seventhday adventist church about 
34000 adventists responded to the study 
although the vast majority of adventists do not smoke by church 
proscription many are adult converts to the religion who smoked 
cigarettes prior to their baptism into the church 
the researchers found that the exsmokers had twice the risk of 
developing leukemia than nonsmokers 
for people who regularly smoked more than 25 cigarettes a day 
the risk of developing leukemia increased threefold the adventists 
who had smoked for more than 15 years had a 2fold increased 
leukemia risk 
leukemia is a bone marrow cancer in which the marrow is replaced 
by immature abnormal white blood cells the disease kills 18000 
people a year in the united states 
dr clark heath jr of the american cancer society said the 
causes of leukemia are largely unknown 
but several studies in recent years including a large study of 
us military veterans have suggested smoking as a cause he said 
the loma linda study estimates that about 20 percent of leukemia 
cases were linked to smoking

president corazon aquinos efforts to 
cope with rising oil costs have produced bizarre flipflops on 
price policy street protests and calls for her resignation from 
former supporters 
the increases which raised fuel prices more than 45 percent 
stunned the middle class which had been a pillar of her support 
her handling also reinforced an image of a detached president 
unsure of power after nearly five years in office 
on monday militant transport workers staged a oneday strike in 
manila cebu and other major cities about 6000 people rallied in 
manila against the increases and smaller protests took place in 
many provincial cities 
hundreds of commuters were stranded in the southern philippines 
today as transport workers continued a strike to protest the 
increase in fuel prices 
protest leaders included several former aquino government 
appointees and veterans of the struggle that toppled the late 
president ferdinand marcos and propelled mrs aquino to power in 
february 1986 
many of them demanded she resign 
it all started wednesday when the energy regulatory board raised 
prices for all grades of petroleum including a more than 70 
percent hike for gasoline 
board chairman marcello fernando said the government could no 
longer subsidize consumer prices due to the rise in crude oil 
prices that occurred after iraq invaded kuwait 
the increases had been expected for weeks but their magnitude 
stunned filipinos already coping with 12 percent inflation 
within hours of the announcement mrs aquino went on national 
television to ask the board to reduce the increase for kerosene and 
cooking fuel widely used by the poor 
the following day the board dutifully complied but boosted 
prices again for gasoline premium prices soared by more than 130 
percent over the level of the previous week 
that effectively priced gasoline beyond the budgets of many 
teachers government employees and managers of small businesses 
the decision to raise fuel pricesstarts the process of 
pauperizing the middle class wrote commentator amando doronila 
in the manila chronicle a government installed by middle class 
disenchantment is in danger of losing its legitimacy 
government officials then launched a campaign of leaks and 
offtherecord briefings in an effort to persuade the public that 
mrs aquino was unaware of the size of the increases 
they blamed her executive secretary catalino macaraig for not 
informing the president on monday the government announced that 
macaraig had been replaced by the youthful popular transport 
secretary oscar orbos who was said to have opposed the increases 
critics said that if mrs aquino was unaware of the increases 
she was derelict in her duty if she was informed then she 
deceived the public 
four of the 23 senators called for her resignation or shortening 
her term through rewriting the constitution three of the four were 
elected in 1987 on the administration ticket 
as criticism mounted mrs aquino appeared again on television 
sunday and suggested that gasoline prices be reduced to wednesdays 
level 
the board then canceled the second gasoline increase fixing the 
price at 57 cents a liter 217 per gallon for premium and 54 
cents a liter for regular 
although the government blames the increase on the persian gulf 
crisis pressure has been mounting for more than a year to end 
price subsidies on fuel 
in march 1989 the government promised the international 
monetary fund that it would raise fuel prices regularly to curb the 
deficit in the oil price stabilization fund which subsidized 
consumer prices 
but the government fearful of domestic unrest if prices rose 
continued subsidizing the fund whose deficit grew to 393 million 
last month the government promised the imf again that it would 
reduce the deficit in hopes of receiving new loans it hoped to 
eliminate the stabilization fund deficit in one bold move 
they tried to correct two years of procrastination 
overnight wrote columnist pedro chanco in the newspaper malaya 
that simply cant be done without causing massive disruptions in 
the lives of people

president slobodan milosevic and his 
renamed communists today swept toward a resounding victory in 
elections that placed serbia squarely at odds with the two other 
leading yugoslav republics 
the opposition conceded defeat monday in yugoslavias most 
populous republic as milosevic took a nearly 4to1 lead over vuk 
draskovic leader of the nationalist serbian renewal movement 
serbia chose bolshevism and darkness instead of democracy and 
light thundered draskovic a shaggybearded procapitalist 
novelist who described the campaign as a contest between the forces 
of good and evil 
i dont want and i dont belong to that kind of serbia he 
said 
opposition parties accused the ruling socialists of vote fraud 
and foreign observers said they were concerned that the republics 
communistcontrolled media may have unfairly influenced the outcome 
of sundays vote 
in the neighboring republic of montenegro yugoslavias 
smallest the communists were also celebrating victory 
by contrast the nationalist vmro party won a plurality over the 
communists in a third and final round of voting in the poorest 
southern state of macedonia the party which advocates macedonias 
full sovereignty won 37 seats and their closest rivals the 
reformed communists 30 seats in the 120seat macedonian 
parliament according to final results made public today 
the future shape of macedonias government is still unclear 
milosevics victory in serbia threatened to deepen rifts between 
it and the westernminded republics of croatia and slovenia which 
ousted communists from power in elections this spring 
the croats and slovenes want to transform yugoslavia into a 
loose confederation from what they claim is a serbiandominated 
federation 
milosevic has slapped duties on slovenian and croatian goods in 
reprisal for their steps toward independence 
if croatia secedes milosevic says he will expand serbias 
borders to protect about 500000 ethnic serbs living there 
the state news agency tanjug said based on a partial count 
milosevics socialists formerly communists won about 60 percent 
of the 250 assembly seats in the republic 
with about 25 percent of the vote counted milosevic had 62 
percent to 17 percent for draskovic milosevics socialists had 43 
percent in the race for the parliament to 15 percent for 
draskovics party 
the opposition accused the government of rigging the vote but 
acknowledged on monday that milosevic would have won anyway 
state television and newspapers in belgrade the national as 
well as serbian capital were unabashedly promilosevic opposition 
figures were given little coverage or portrayed as traitors whose 
victory could lead to civil war 
in terms of procedures at individual voting places the 
elections passed fairly well said robert hand a monitor from 
the conference on security and cooperation in europe our main 
concern is what happened before the elections 
there was little voting in the republics troubled kosovo 
province where the ethnic albanian majority staged a boycott to 
protest serbian measures that have deprived the region of 
selfrule 
there has been no parliament government or albanianlanguage 
media operating in kosovo since july 5 
milosevics actions there drew the repudiation of leaders from 
the rest of the republic as did a bill he pushed through 
parliament stipulating prison sentences for people slandering the 
president 
yugoslavia was founded as a kingdom of serbs croats and 
slovenes in 1918 and reformed as a communist republic during world 
war ii 
it has traditionally been a volatile amalgam of squabbling 
nationalities and ethnic groups the split between the politically 
centerright north and the lessdeveloped communist south now 
threatens to break the country apart 
slovenia the most westernleaning of the yugoslav republics 
lying on the italian border will vote in a referendum dec 23 on 
whether to become fully independent

the parley and criticized seoul for jailing three dissidents 
the three were arrested nov 30 after they returned home from 
meeting north koreans in berlin to discuss korean unification the 
seoul government maintains that dialogue on unification must be 
conducted through official channels 
the time when discussion of unification is monopolized by 
certain people is over said an byong su a north korean 
spokesman we are concerned about the reality in which civilians 
cannot meet in their own land or travel to an alien land for 
meeting 
issues which do not fall within the purview of the talks 
should not be raised countered kim hyunggi of south koreas 
unification board 
the talks to conclude thursday are the third round since 
october and the highestlevel meetings between the koreas since the 
peninsula was divided in 1945 and the border tightly sealed 
in neither of the two countries is the premier the

leader roh tae woo the elected president of the south 
south korean premier kang younghoon greeted north korean 
premier yon at a seoul hotel kang denied news reports that he was 
planning to retire after the talks finish

southnorth dialogue properly kang told yon i think i can 
stay in this position only with your help

afterward the delegates stood and sang a song which begins our 
wish is unification 
the talks will deal with visitor exchanges and easing political 
and military tensions between the two countries north korea seeks 
a nonaggression pact but the south claims confidencebuilding 
agreements are needed first 
no major agreement is expected but the talks are seen as one 
more step in the lengthy process of drawing the two nations closer 
north korea is one of the worlds few remaining tightly 
controlled communist states with everything revolving kim il sung 
south korea while still emerging from decades of military control 
has a functioning democracy 
small steady efforts and finally little gains will lead 
to quantitative change said limb dongwon a diplomat and 
spokesman for the souths delegation 
we will positively study any north korean proposals he told 
a news briefing 
roh is flying to moscow this week for a summit with president 
mikhail s gorbachev and says he will discuss improving relations 
on the peninsula 
north korea has bitterly criticized rohs visit claiming it 
would sabotage the dialogue between two koreas north korea was a 
close soviet ally before the end of the cold war

police said today they had orders to 
arrest ousted president hussain muhammad ershad and a dozen senior 
officials from his government were being sought by authorities one 
was put under house arrest 
a senior police official said he expected ershad to be detained 
by wednesday other officials said the order could be carried out 
today 
the police official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the former home minister mahmudul hassan had been put under house 
arrest the police official said policemen raided a dozen other 
homes looking for senior officials of ershads ousted government 
as home minister mahmudul was in charge of the police and the 
paramilitary bangladesh rifles which were held responsible for the 
deaths of about 100 people during the seven weeks of unrest aimed 
at forcing ershad to resign 
ershad facing unrelenting public pressure and the refusal of 
his army to support him any longer handed over power last week to 
the supreme court chief justice shahabuddin ahmed as acting 
president 
in another development the caretaker administration moved today 
to drastically toughen the punishment for illegal possession of 
weapons raising the maximum sentence from three years to life in 
prison 
the order signaled that the interim government intends to act 
harshly against anyone trying to disrupt parliamentary elections 
which are to be held within three months 
opposition parties under pressure from radical university 
students who spearheaded the antiershad campaign have urged that 
the ousted president be tried on charges of corruption and abuse of 
power during his eightyear rule 
the opposition has called for three days of demonstrations to 
back up their demand for his arrest and trial 
ershad seized power in a bloodless coup in 1982 and ruled under 
martial law for four years he was widely accused of fixing two 
parliamentary elections and won a presidential election in 1986 
against token opposition 
shahabuddin the acting president has sounded out the 
opposition parties on the possibility of allowing ershad to flee 
the country to avoid a trial 
for the most part the parties publicly opposed the idea but 
sheik hasina leader of one of the antiershad alliances left the 
door open for exile 
we want a bangladesh without ershad i dont mind if that is 
achieved by his arrest and trial or by throwing him out of the 
country she told reporters today 
on monday a mob attacked the home of ershads vice president 
moudad ahmed with crude bombs causing some damage moudud was not 
home and no one was injured moudud has denied any wrongdoing and 
said ershads jatiya party intended to contest the parliamentary 
elections 
shahabuddin meanwhile told the military not to interfere in 
the elections the nation expects law enforcing agencies 
including the armed forces to exercise complete neutrality in 
helping conduct free and fair polls united news of bangladsh 
quoted him as telling army officers 
the army traditionally plays a strong role in politics in 
bangladesh most of the presidents bangladesh has had since 
independence in 1971 were former generals or were installed by the 
military

sen paul sarbanes has admitted borrowing some 
remarks from pulitzer prizewinning historian arthur schlesinger 
while challenging the bush administrations persian gulf policies 
sarbanes dmd said monday he should have credited 
schlesinger a former white house adviser to president kennedy 
last wednesday when he disputed president bushs conclusion that he 
alone had the anguish of deciding whether to send young soldiers to 
battle 
both sarbanes and schlesinger spoke on the subject at senate 
foreign relations committee hearings last week schlesinger on 
tuesday and sarbanes a day later 
a review of transcripts of their remarks shows sarbanes a 
committee member borrowed schlesingers comments without crediting 
him 
in his statement schlesinger said 
i notice the president in his moving remarks last friday about 
the anguish of sending young kids to war said its only the 
president that should be asked to make the decision i hope he 
will reconsider that remark if anything is clear about the 
original intent of the constitution it is that as abraham lincoln 
said the constitution was written precisely to ensure that no one 
man should hold the power of bringing this oppression upon us 
the following day in questioning secretary of state james baker 
iii before the same committee sarbanes said 
the president in fact said in a moving statement when he 
spoke about his concern about committing american men to war said 
and i quote him its only the president that should be asked to 
make the decision i would hope the president would reconsider 
that remark because i think if anything is clear about the 
constitution it is that as abraham lincoln said the 
constitution was written precisely to ensure that no one man should 
hold the power of bringing this oppression on us 
i should have probably said as dr schlesinger pointed out 
to our committee yesterday sarbanes said monday 
im perfectly happy to accede to the fact that what i used 
came from dr schlesinger sarbanes said 
sarbanes said he delivered his remarks without a prepared text 
and drew in part from other congressional testimony that he had 
heard or read

the soviet union is backing secretary of state 
james a baker iiis timetable for his mission to baghdad and a 
ussoviet agreement may be near for both powers to end weapons 
shipments to rival factions in afghanistan 
the two cooperative moves surfaced as baker and soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze resume their drive for a new treaty 
to trim us and soviet nuclear weapons stocks 
bridges are being built a soviet official said monday night 
after baker and shevardnadze discussed the unsettled issues for 3 
hours 
neither side claimed real headway on completing the strategic 
arms reduction treaty which would require a cut of about 30 
percent in longrange nuclear bombers missiles and submarines 
baker and shevardnadze fly to washington tonight and will report 
the results of their talks to president bush on wednesday 
once the treaty is completed bush and soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev are expected to set the date for a treatysigning at a 
summit meeting in moscow 
on three other fronts there was marked progress toward closer 
ties 
baker offered sympathetic consideration monday to any soviet 
request for emergency food and medical supplies 
shevardnadze his country staggering on the edge of economic 
disintegration said we would appreciate it 
also the soviet foreign minister appeared to credit reports 
that his government would suspend weapons shipments to the 
promoscow regime in afghanistan while the bush administration 
ceases arming a coalition of rebels 
that could end the decadeold war in the southwest asian 
country 
well reach agreement on afghanistan tomorrow shevardnadze 
told reporters 
on iraq the soviet foreign minister backed bakers stand on 
going to baghdad for talks with iraqi president saddam hussein 
baker has rejected an iraqi proposal that he go to baghdad on 
jan 12 only three days before the united nations security 
councils deadline for iraq to leave kuwait or face a forcible 
eviction 
baker said sunday he wont be a party to playing games that 
back us up to that deadline he proposed going to baghdad to see 
saddam either dec 2022 or on jan 3 
at bakers meeting monday with shevardnadze a senior soviet 
official said the foreign minister reiterated his support his 
understanding of that schedule 
the soviets who sent yevgeny primakov their top expert on the 
persian gulf to baghdad on two futile missions do not plan to 
send an emissary there for the time being the soviet official 
said 
shevardnadzes support and deferral of any new soviet overtures 
to saddam strengthens the united stand taken by the two 
superpowers against iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the washington post today quoted soviet sources as saying baker 
asked shevardnadze to commit a token soviet military force to the 
gulf but that shevardnadze refused a us official disputed the 
account saying that while baker and shevardnadze had discussed 
sending such a force in past meetings the subject had not come up 
in their talks here 
bakers trip to iraq could be the last opportunity for iraq to 
yield to international demands for a pullout before facing an 
attack 
meanwhile a us official who also spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the iraqi government had not responded to bakers 
rejection of the jan 12 proposal

vice president dan quayle said today that 
congressional inaction on the persian gulf crisis sends a message 
of support for president bushs policy against iraq but he accused 
some democrats of playing politics with the situation 
they passed resolutions before they left and theyve done 
nothing to change those resolutions so therefore our 
interpretation is support quayle told reporters at the 
republican governors conference 
he said the white house would like congress now in recess to 
adopt a favorable resolution but thats not likely he did not 
call for a special session saying that is for congressional 
leaders to decide 
lacking a new endorsement measure he said silence equals 
support 
the resolutions he cited were adopted by the house and senate in 
october endorsing administration policy at that time that 
preceded bushs decision to double the american force deployed 
against iraq and open the possibility of offensive action to drive 
saddam hussein out of kuwait 
quayle said congressional hearings on the crisis permitted 
democrats the luxury of criticism without the burden of 
accountability 
he would not identify democrats he said had attempted to use the 
crisis for partisan political advantage 
im not getting into names at all he said today when asked 
whether he was criticizing sen sam nunn dga chairman of the 
senate armed services committee the panel that held the initial 
hearings hearings he criticized 
congress has not even sworn in its new members yet already 
its playing politics he told republican governors on monday 
the gop governors conference was winding up today with an appraisal 
of the nov 6 elections and a look at the next campaign by 
pollsters and party leaders 
the vice president told the governors he is confident 
republicans will be united behind bush in 1992 
when the president unveils our agenda i am certain it will 
rally our troops and unify our growing yet at times contentious 
republican party quayle said in a reference to inhouse gop 
debate over the best way to shape and deliver future government 
programs 
once the president decides it will not be republicans vs 
republicans but republicans vs democrats quayle said the 
election cycle of 1992 is already upon us the battle for this 
decades political agenda has certainly begun 
quayle complained that the first three witnesses before the 
senate armed services committee early this month all were critical 
of bush policy nunn chairman of that committee is a fixture on 
the list of potential democratic challengers for the white house 
sen albert gore jr dtenn who sought the nomination in 1988 
and says he is considering it again is a committee member 
they have been among the critics of bushs decision to double 
the us force arrayed against iraq opening the possibility of 
offensive action to drive saddam hussein out of occupied kuwait 
democratic congressional leaders decided on hearings instead of 
calling congress back into session to consider legislation on us 
policy bush had said that was alright with him he also has said 
he would welcome congressional backing for his course quayle told 
the governors the prospect of recalling congress posed a dilemma 
because there is no perceived consensus 
i cannot predict with any certainty what they will do when 
they get back in january he said 
retired military and government officials at the armed services 
committee hearings and at companion hearings of the senate foreign 
relations committee recommended a goslow course in the gulf 
crisis one in which the usled alliance against saddam hussein 
would wait for economic sanctions to take their full toll on iraq 
but quayle said waiting 12 to 18 months would be unacceptable 
patience at any price would be a failed policy he said 
amounting to appeasement of saddam quayle said the iraqi president 
is trying to use congress and american public opinion in a 
political war to deprive the administration of its option to use 
force 
it wont work he said because despite the efforts of some in 
congress the fact of the matter is that the american people 
support the president quayle added that in the end when 
americas vital interests are on the line the majority of congress 
can rise above partisan politics 
but he argued that is not happening now 
a congress solidly united behind the president would 
strengthen the chances for peace quayle said 
unfortunately by portraying themselves as the party of peace 
and the administration as the party of war some congressional 
democrats but by no means all congressional democrats seem to 
have placed partisanship above statesmanship he said

polish authorities said today that 
stanislaw tyminski the defeated presidential contender will 
probably be allowed to go home to canada if he guarantees he will 
return to face a slander investigation 
meanwhile the man who defeated him presidentelect lech 
walesa went to polands holiest catholic shrine in czestochowa 
today to pay homage to the black madonna icon at the jasna gora 
monastery 
later walesa was returning to warsaw to mull over his choice 
for prime minister walesa won a landslide victory over tyminski in 
sundays presidential runoff election and is to be sworn in for a 
fiveyear term later this month 
tyminski an emigre businessman says he needs to go home to 
canada to gather evidence to defend himself against the slander 
charges 
the justice ministry said tyminski was to be questioned today 
and might be allowed to leave wednesday if he makes a sufficient 
guarantee he will return for legal proceedings 
tyminski and his peruvianborn wife planed to leave for toronto 
on wednesday morning he said he only wanted to leave the country 
for three days and that he was prepared to put up 100000 to 
guarantee his return 
a prosecutor in nowy sacz in southern poland began a slander 
investigation after tyminski accused prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki of treason during a nov 17 campaign rally 
the prosecutors office in warsaw said on monday that tyminski 
had to stay in the country and answer a dec 17 summons in nowy 
sacz 
tyminski said mazowiecki who lost in the first round of the 
presidential election on nov 25 had betrayed the nation by 
creating chaos through economic reform after taking office in 
august 1989 
there has been speculation that tyminski hounded by polands 
highly partisan press could return for good to canada where he 
lived many of the past 21 years after leaving poland to seek his 
fortune 
he has said he wants to remain active in polish politics 
my duty and responsibility is to stay here because i received 
very strong suport tyminski said at a news conference today 
but he said he was unsure whether he would found an opposition 
political party 
tyminski a 42yearold computer company owner who also brought 
cable tv to the peruvian jungle portrayed his saga as a 
ragstoriches story and tapped into the polish mythology of the 
rich uncle in america 
but his firstround election success was derailed before 
sundays runoff by questions about his connections with former 
communist operatives and the vagueness of his promises for quick 
economic recovery 
tyminski who also has canadian and peruvian citizenship had 
lied with his children near toronto until this fall when he 
returned to poland 
in making his request to leave poland tyminski said he wanted 
to see his children for the first time in more than two months 
he also said he needed to prepare his defense using videotapes 
of the nov 17 campaign rally that were taken to canada he said 
the tapes will prove he did not slander mazowiecki

at least 35 people were killed today 
as rival black factions battled with guns knives and axes setting 
fire to shacks and chasing terrified people through the streets 
dozens of homes were burned and hundreds of residents fled as 
rival groups battled for several hours during the morning in tokoza 
black township and in a surrounding industrial area hacked and 
mutilated bodies lay outside houses that had been burned and 
pillaged 
the fighting pitted mostly xhosas loyal to the african national 
congress against zulus of the inkatha freedom party in what 
increasingly appeared to be a tribal confrontation the xhosas live 
in a squatter camp while the zulus live in adjoining hostels 
at least 53 people have died in factional fighting in tokoza 
since the latest fighting began on the weekend 
inkatha came they were burning the shacks they are trying to 
drive us out said a terrified xhosa man wearing only trousers 
and holding a club 
xhosa squatters armed with clubs spears and knives gathered for 
safety at one end of the township while hundreds of armed zulus in 
white headbands were waiting in a migrant workerss hostel at the 
other end of tokoza 
we want revenge we want to fight some zulus chanted 
police in armored vehicles roared through the dusty township on 
the eastern outskirts of johannesburg police patrols hovered on 
the edges of the township but rarely ventured into the narrow 
lanes leading to its densely packed shacks 
xhosa and zulu residents accused each other of starting the 
violence both sides accused the police of collaborating with their 
opponents 
a number of zulu women armed with clubs and knives their faces 
painted white were helping guard the zulu hostels they claimed 
the police had fired on them 
the police dont help us said one angry woman the xhosas 
started the fighting they better leave this place this is for 
zulus only 
enraged xhosas at the other end of town yelled insults at the 
police saying they were inkatha 
police spokesman capt eugene opperman denied police were 
involved in the fighting we side with no one he said 
opperman said the fighting apparently started today when xhosas 
attacked a zulu hostel and the zulus mounted a revenge attack 
police were fired on by men in a vehicle and fired back killing 
one man and wounding two others opperman said no police were 
hurt 
more than 1000 people have been killed in the factional riots 
in the johannesburg area since august the anc and inkatha both 
oppose apartheid but both want to lead a nonapartheid south 
africa 
inkatha favors a conservative policy including free enterprise 
while the anc leans more to leftist economic policies 
president fw de klerk who has promised to end apartheid is 
expected to begin talks next year on ending whiteminority rule

president mikhail s gorbachev today sent 
condolences to the family of armand hammer citing the late 
industrialist for his prominent role in sovietamerican relations 
mr hammer was associated with one of the most remarkable 
pages of our relationship with the united states the message 
said he met with lenin and was very close in many ways to the 
soviet union and to russia 
gorbachevs message was read by his spokesman vitaly ignatenko 
hammer died in los angeles on monday after a brief illness he 
was 92 
foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh said hammer will be 
remembered in the soviet union for his tireless efforts to maintain 
good relations with the kremlin even during the cold war 
armand hammer was not only an observer a witness to the 
decades in the history of sovietamerican relations but also a man 
who actively participated in the building of those relations 
gremitskikh said 
his constructive activity was especially appreciable and 
fruitful in the periods of coolness in the relations between the 
ussr and the united states gremitskikh said he always 
raised his voice and in addressing leaders of both superpowers 
spoke out in favor of overcoming difficulties and for fruitful 
cooperation in all spheres 
hammers involvement in the soviet union began in 1921 as a 
young doctor just out of medical school who came to the country to 
help in famine relief 
he met with vladimir lenin and sought his help in 
reestablishing trade between the communist regime and the west he 
worked out a deal to trade surplus us grain for soviet products 
at one point hammer was sole representative for 38 us 
companies in the soviet union and also owned and operated an 
asbestos mine and founded the first pencil factory in the nation 
during one visit to the soviet union he said ill never 
forget what lenin told me during one of our meetings he said dr 
hammer we dont need doctors we need business people who can do 
things that was the end of my promising medical career 
hammer maintained his ties to the soviet union from the lenin 
years to the era of perestroika initiated by gorbachev he met with 
every soviet leader since lenin 
he always raised his voice and in addressing leaders of both 
superpowers spoke out in favor of overcoming difficulties and for 
fruitful cooperation in all spheres gremitskikh said 
one of his largest developments in moscow is the huge 
mezhdunarodnaya hotel and sovincenter exhibition complex built on 
the banks of the moscow river it is known in the city as the 
hammer center

the parliament of the russian federation and the 
president of the kazakh republic today rejected soviet president 
mikhail gorbachevs proposal to retain central control over the 
economy 
gorbachev has proposed a new union treaty to keep the 15 soviet 
republics together and to maintain central government control over 
key natural resources and major industries 
but the russian republics congress of peoples deputies and 
nursultan nazarbayev president of kazakhstan the thirdlargest 
soviet republic each said they would sign the proposed treaty only 
if it gives them control over their own economies 
we stand for the treaty nazarbayev said but attempts 
from the top to organize the treaty will not succeed 
boris yeltsin president of the russian federation the largest 
soviet republic has taken the same stand and repeated it on 
monday as the russian parliament voted to appoint a commission to 
negotiate the union treaty the state news agency tass reported 
the legislatures of the secondlargest soviet republic the 
ukraine and all but one of the remaining republics have declared 
economic and political sovereignty the 15th kirgizia was 
reportedly debating the issue this week 
nazarbayev said at a news conference he thought at least 11 
soviet republics would sign the treaty the three baltic republics 
and moldavia he said were boycotting the negotiations 
the economic integration of the republics will not allow us to 
get out of this crisis separately we must do it together 
nazarbayev said 
he said the balance of ownership must change 
now central authorities own 93 percent of businesses in 
kazakhstan and turn over less than 1 percent of the profits 
nazarbayev said that under his republics sovereignty 
declaration passed oct 25 his central asian republic would take 
control of those businesses including substantial coal reserves in 
the eastern part of the republic and a huge oil and natural gas 
field now being explored in western kazakhstan 
moreover kazakhstan plans to sign a contract with a us 
consortium in january to exploit an oil field and kazakhstan plans 
to reap its share of the profits from that deal rather than send 
them to the central government he said 
the vote by the russian federation congress of peoples deputies 
marked a small victory for gorbachev because it commits russia to 
be a fullfledged subject of the renewed ussr on the basis of 
a new union treaty 
but it also gives yeltsin strong leverage in negotiations with 
gorbachev by asserting the right of each republic for 
selfdetermination and gives the central government responsibility 
only for defense state security and foreign policy 
the draft proposed by gorbachev would retain broader powers for 
the central government including control over transportation and 
energy supplies 
the russian parliament decided to appoint a commission of 
lawmakers to work with representatives of the central government 
and other republics to work on the draft union treaty no date has

a conservative party member 
apologized today to a black parliamentary candidate for racist 
remarks that had been condemned by local and national party 
leaders 
william galbraith issued his apology on the day the cheltenham 
conservative party association was scheduled to vote on expelling 
him galbraiths remarks had been condemned by prime minister john 
major and other tory leaders 
cheltenham police were investigating complaints that galbraiths 
remarks about john taylor who hopes to be the first black 
conservative in the house of commons were an incitement to racial 
hatred 
after taylor had been selected as the local candidate for the 
next national election galbraith was quoted in a national 
newspaper as calling taylor a bloody nigger galbraith repeated 
the slur in broadcast interviews 
galbraith also said he was unhappy that taylor was not a 
resident of cheltenham an almost totally white heavily 
middleclass town although it is common in british politics for 
parliamentary candidates to be outsiders 
major declared in the house of commons that the remarks had no 
place within the conservative party and galbraith has been banned 
from the local conservative club and from two of his favorite pubs 
on tuesday galbraith issued a statement supporting taylor 
mr galbraith acknowledges that mr taylors color and ethnic 
origins are utterly irrelevant in the circumstances galbraith 
said in the statement released by his lawyers 
taylor said he was pleased with the apology 
i have never made race and color an electoral issue he 
said i have always remained at arms length from all this all i 
wanted to do was to get on with the pleasant task of getting to 
know the people of cheltenham all this has been a diversion 
taylor 38 was selected two weeks ago as the conservative 
candidate for cheltenham a picturesque town 120 miles northwest of 
london 
he has run previously as a conservative candidate in solihull 
his home town in central england typically aspiring politicians 
have to run one or more hopeless campaigns before being selected in 
a district where they have a chance of winning 
taylor the son of a west indian cricket player is a barrister 
a lawyer qualified to argue cases in court and a member of the 
local council solihull 
there are only four blacks in the 650seat house of commons all 
members of the labor party 
about 5 percent of britains population is classified as 
nonwhite a broad label that includes west indians 
pakistanis indians chinese and persons of mixed race

six members of an elite narcotics squad were 
convicted of stealing thousands of dollars in drug money in a 
scandal that rocked the los angeles county sheriffs department 
a seventh deputy was convicted of money laundering monday in the 
case which led to the disbanding of whole sheriffs units and 
imperiled dozens of criminal cases 
federal prosecutors portrayed the deputies as corrupt lawmen who 
skimmed money taken in drug raids to buy boats homes cars and 
vacations 
the jury convicted the deputies on 24 criminal charges 
we trust these people and now theyre doing things they 
shouldnt be doing things that they arrest people for doing 
juror dawn hurtt said 
the defendants were members of an antidrug unit that was 
responsible for some of the departments largest cocaine and drug 
money seizures the deputies had up to 23 years of experience with 
the sheriffs department 
the verdicts handed down today are not an occasion to 
celebrate they are not a victory sheriff sherman block said in 
a statement they are the just conclusion to the unlawful actions 
of a few who sought to hide their crimes behind a badge of honor 
the us district court jury also convicted six of the deputies 
for conspiracy and theft five were found guilty of lying on their 
tax returns 
the jury deadlocked on 26 other counts which judge edward 
rafeedie dismissed three deputies were acquitted of charges 
related to the theft of 527000 
the deputies remained free on bail 
im sure this jury did the best job they could said 
defendant james r bauder but were disappointed 
the scandal broke in february when federal prosecutors filed a 
27count indictment accusing the deputies of stealing 14 million 
in drug cash 
however the jury only found the deputies guilty of taking 
48000 in a 1989 incident videotaped during an fbi sting 
operation 
the scandal led to an investigation of the nations largest 
sheriffs department block disbanded four narcotics teams and set 
a fiveyear limit on the time a deputy can spend working in the 
narcotics bureau 
dozens of narcotics officers were transferred and more than 30 
criminal cases were dismissed became subject to plea bargains or 
came under review 
a federal grand jury continues to investigate the department and 
some narcotics officers in the los angeles police department 
prosecutors accused the deputies of seizing cash during raids 
and obtaining statements from alleged traffickers disowning the 
cash the deputies then allegedly stole some of the money and 
distributed it among themselves 
prosecutors pointed to evidence of thousands of dollars stashed 
in shoe boxes at deputies homes and alleged shopping sprees that 
showed the men were living well beyond their 40000 to 60000 
salaries 
the deputies said they got the extra cash through babysitting 
gambling or inheritance 
two other narcotics deputies are scheduled to stand trial next 
year in the case

where they could legally destroy the unions force a strike so 
they could legally shut down the paper don singleton a daily 
news reporter and bargaining team member told the crowd 
we hope we can convince the tribune not to shut the place 
down stop wasting the millions of dollars they have been spending 
to bust the unions 
don turner of the chicago federation of labor said the company 
tries to kill unions but we know in the end the workers are 
going to be victorious as they always are

questioning the morality of the daily news exercising its lawful 
rights to employ replacement workers we would not have done so 
unless the very survival of the business was not threatened after

its distribution has been curtailed by violence against delivery 
drivers threats against newsstand vendors and a unionled boycott 
which also crippled advertising sales

552000 as of last week 
the news says that by the end of this year its losses over the 
past decade will have mounted to about 200 million and that it 
must have major concessions to operate profitably

a decadelong study of possible links between oral 
contraceptive use and cancer found the evidence too inconclusive to 
warrant changes in prescribing the pill the world health 
organization said tuesday 
an expert panel said that family planning programs based on the 
pill do not need to be changed 
the agency reported on studies in eight developing and three 
industrialized countries that explored whether using the pill 
increases the risk of cancer 
experts from 11 countries met privately at who headquarters in 
geneva to review the studies and other evidence according to a 
statement issued by the agency 
their findings included 
most studies suggest no general link between the pill and 
cervical or breast cancer more research is needed because some 
studies have found connections between longterm oral contraceptive 
use and the risk of either cancer among some groups of women but 
the link could also be due to better disease detection or special 
characteristics of women using the pill 
oral contraceptives increase the risk of benign liver tumors 
but this is a very rare complication 
the pill can reduce the risk of ovarian cancer cancer of the 
innerlining of the uterus and benign breast diseases 
the general conclusion was that evidence about the association 
between oral contraceptives and various types of tumors does not 
indicate there is any need for a change in policy in prescribing 
the contraceptive pill said dr olof meirik an official in 
whos human reproduction program 
more than 60 million women are believed to use the pill 
worldwide nearly twothirds of them in developing countries who

a chinese zoos first artificially conceived 
panda twins passed their threemonth birthday in good health 
making panda history an official report said tuesday 
the xinhua news agency quoted zhang anju vice president of the 
china zoo society as saying that the twins one male and one 
female are sure to survive at this point 
most giant pandas born in captivity die in their first weks 
and scientists are not sure why 
zhang said the problem was especially acute with pandas 
conceived through artificial insemination as the twins were it 
also is rare for both twin pandas to survive because mother pandas 
frequently take care of one and neglect the other 
zhang said the female cubs weight had increased from 53 ounces 
when it was born aug 24 to more than 13 pounds as of monday the 
males weight increased from 5 ounces to 13 pounds 
they were born at the chengdu zoo in southwestern china which 
has an active program of inseminating captive pandas the procedure 
is controversial among scientists many foreign wildlife experts 
argue that it would be better to reproduce conditions in the wild 
to encourage mating and natural pregnancies 
xinhua said only 24 of the 1155 pandas born worldwide as a 
result of artificial insemination have survived the twins mother 
qingqing was herself the product of artificial insemination 
china has the worlds only wild panda population but its 
numbers have plummeted in recent decades to between 1100 and 1500 
due to poaching and human encroachment on its habitat about 100 
pandas live in chinese zoos

l jay oliva a scholar in russian history and 
chancellor of new york university was named tuesday to succeed 
john brademas as president of nyu 
oliva 57 will assume the presidency of the nations largest 
private university in january 1992 
brademas a former 11term indiana congressman who served as 
nyus president since 1981 will become president emeritus in 1992 
he had said last summer he would step down as president when he 
turned 65 
olivas appointment by nyus board of trustees came as no 
surprise a trustee committee decided to forgo a national search 
when it became clear oliva had overwhelming support from all 
constituencies 
oliva will be the first faculty member to lead the 
44000student university in its 159year history said laurence a 
tisch chairman of nyus board of trustees 
in dr oliva we have not only a great teacher and outstanding 
scholar but someone who understands the way a university functions 
on every level tisch said 
oliva has a reputation as an easygoing approachable 
administrator who lives in a student dormitory with his wife mary 
ellen 
in an interview tuesday oliva said he planned to remain in that 
dorm room as president and to continue teaching 
ive been waiting all my life to say this is the age of the 
teacher he said 
asked if russian history held any lessons for someone about to 
assume a college presidency oliva singled out czar peter the 
great the subject of one of olivas books 
peter the great felt it was totally unproductive to be daunted 
by big problems peter never brooked the idea that a big challenge 
was impossible he said 
brademas greatly increased nyus stature aided by his 
formidable fundraising abilities since 1981 nyu raised more than 
800 million dorm space was greatly expanded and the university 
moved to the front ranks nationally in fields including business 
fine arts and accounting 
the cost has risen with the reputation tuition fees room and 
board for entering students this fall were 21400 among the 
nations highest 
oliva said one of his priorities will be to make it easier for 
students to cross departmental lines in their studies to 
encourage law students to take courses in the business school or 
the school of public administration for example 
weve got our buildings now what i want to see is a community 
of scholars he said

israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
today he and president bush have smoothed relations between their 
two countries strained by the us partnership with arab leaders 
against iraq 
the president issued a warm welcome to shamir at the outset 
of their oval office talks this morning but he rebuffed questions 
from reporters about the middle east situation 
we have been delighted to express our full support for the 
leadership of the president for the policy of the united states in 
this recent crisis of the gulf shamir told reporters after 
spending nearly two hours with bush at the white house 
and the president also expresses his support for our behavior 
for our policy in the crisis shamir added 
israeli officials said before the meeting that shamir would tell 
bush that israel does not intend to launch any preemptive strikes 
against iraq 
assistant secretary of state john kelly said that shamir didnt 
talk about potential israeli actions but that bush thanked him 
for keeping a low profile in the crisis 
there was a strong expression of identity of views on seeing 
iraqi aggression rebuffed kelly told reporters 
but he also said there was no attempt to duck the tough 
issues of jewish settlements in the occupied territories and 
israels use of force against palestinian protests in those areas 
kelly did not elaborate 
the administration has been concerned in recent days by 
suggestions from senior israeli officials that if the united states 
doesnt dismantle iraqs military machine israel might 
we have reached general understanding more or less on all 
the moves in the gulf and on israels position shamir told 
reporters the meeting will enhance the special relationship between 
the 
united states and israel shamir said 
israel has been torn between its promise to the united states to 
lay low in the persian gulf crisis and fears that the 
administration is moving toward a diplomatic solution that will 
leave intact iraqs stores of chemical and biological weapons 
administration officials have been discussing arms control 
measures that might be used to prevent iraq from menacing its 
neighbors once the current crisis is resolved 
israel looks to the united states to provide the leadership 
and resolve that will rid the middle east of such dangers in the 
future shamir said in a statement issued in new york on monday 
but he added saddam hussein of iraq knows that israel will 
not remain passive if he tries to harm us 
saddam has threatened israel with chemical weapons and israels 
air force has been on high alert since his aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
bush and shamir also discussed the shape of the middle east 
after the crisis with iraq is resolved shamir said they agreed 
that substantive peace moves would have to await resolution of the 
gulf crisis 
israelis are worried that some us allies in the gulf crisis 
especially syria and saudi arabia will demand payment for their 
support in the form of us pressure on israel to relinquish lands 
it captured from the arabs in the 1967 mideast war 
but shamir said he had been assured by bush this would not 
happen i trust the president he said that there wont be 
any deal at the expense of israel 
we trust the american governments determined stand not to 
permit saddam hussein to link the gulf crisis with the arabisrael 
conflict and the palestinian issue shamir said in his new york 
remarks 
the administration while rejecting attempts by iraq and its 
allies to link the two issues in a united nations security council 
resolution under debate in new york is keen on reviving stalled 
mideast peace moves 
dennis ross a senior aide to secretary of state james a baker 
iii will head for israel next week to discuss how to move toward 
talks on arabisraeli peace 
us attempts until now have focused on getting israelis to sit 
down with palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
but the palestinians fervent support for iraq in the gulf crisis 
has changed that equation 
the israeli government which has balked at the us attempts 
hopes to seize the opportunity to press for a changed peace 
formula 
israeli officials said shamir was stressing that the shape of 
future mideast talks will depend on the outcome of the 
confrontation with iraq if the us side emerges victorious 
members of the coalition like syria and saudi arabia might be 
willing to talk peace with israel 
but a perception that iraq has gained the upper hand would 
scuttle all hopes for peace by strengthening the arab hardliners 
israeli officials say 
israel also is seeking additional us help in absorbing the 
flood of jews 1000 to 2000 a day immigrating from the soviet 
union 
shamir said israels population of 45 million could grow by 1 
million in the next three to five years and the cost could reach 
40 billion israeli officials said shamir wasnt making a specific 
aid request but that israel is looking for the type of guarantees 
the administration provided this year to finance the construction 
of 400 million in new homes 
shamir said bush had promised that israels request would be 
debated

sale of shortterm notes to help the city remain solvent until 
major tax payments come due in february and march 
the treasurers refusal to join the note sale was a blow to the 
goode administration which also is asking the city pension fund 
state teachers pension fund local banks and private investors to 
buy about 300 million in notes this month 
the mayor believes this is an important ingredient to the 
shortterm note sale goodes press secretary karen warrington 
said it provides ability to have the state pay directly to a 
third party and it increases the security for any shortterm 
monies that we would want to borrow 
heyison said he did not know how much money the city would 
receive or how soon as a result of the directive 
it all depends on what request they send over from various 
agencies he said 
philadelphias requests would be handled with the same review 
measures as they would normally he added 
were not doing anything differently than we normally do for 
voucher transmittals other than expediting the processing he 
said 
city workers and pensioners widely oppose risking part of their 
15 billion in pension funds to help philadelphia meet its 
shortterm obligations said charles johnson a municipal printer 
who serves on the city board of pensions and retirement 
the board meets thursday and friday but a vote may be delayed 
no formal proposal had been made by the city as of monday and the 
board has hired washington attorney ian lanoff to advise them on 
whatever proposal is made 
the citys credit rating has dropped to junkbond levels during 
its fiscal crisis this year making its notes too risky for the 
pension boards normal investment guidelines 
but goode recently signed a law that allows the board to invest 
until july 1 in any philadelphia obligation regardless of quality 
sluggish tax revenues and arbitrationawarded pay increases have 
added to past budget imbalances to create a projected 2295 
million deficit for the fiscal year that started july 1 
a 375 million note issue flopped in september leading to a 
cash crisis until major tax payments come due in february and 
march the city risks having to survive on daily receipts of less 
than onefourth its average 9 million daily bills

more than 50 pilot whales were found 
beached today on squaw island near the kennedy family compound on 
cape cod and volunteers rushed to try to rescue them 
they are still alive at this moment said james ellis 
spokesman for the center for coastal studies in provincetown 
fiftyfour whales measuring up to 20 feet in length were 
spotted around midmorning near the island and a single whale was 
found on the capes bay side ellis said 
ian mcmillan associate director of the cape cod aquarium said 
rescuers would try to determine which whales are in the best shape 
to be returned to the water the tide had already gone out leaving 
some of the whales in shallow pools 
it was the first mass beaching in the area since 70 pilot whales 
beached themselves at several spots four years ago most of those 
whales died but three young whales beached on the cape three years 
ago were rescued and returned to the sea 
experts disagree on the cause of the beachings theories include 
that the pod or school of whales follows a sick leader ashore or 
that the marine mammals are disoriented by magnetic variations 
along geological faults 
the rescue effort being coordinated by the new england 
aquarium included the centers for coastal studies the 
international wildlife coalition and the international fund for 
animal welfare said kathy shorr a spokesman for the center for 
coastal studies

an aide to california sen alan cranston today 
denied she pressured or asked federal regulators to reverse their 
decision tightening controls on charles h keating jrs troubled 
lincoln savings and loan 
testifying at the senate ethics committees keating five 
hearings carolyn jordan said she talked by telephone with two 
staff regulators in may 1988 but did not make a request to go easy 
on lincoln 
jordan cranstons staff assistant on the senate banking 
committee underwent friendly questioning by cranstons defense 
attorney william taylor 
did you put any kind of pressure on the regulators in any 
way to change their ways and ease pressure taylor asked 
i did not say anything no i did not jordan said 
jordan spent all morning on the witness stand and her sometimes 
spotty memory provoked a sharp complaint by the ranking republican 
on the ethics panel sen warren rudman of new hampshire 
id like to get more specific rudman said interrupting the 
questioning 
the witness obviously has very good recollection about some 
things and very poor recollection about others i think weve got 
to guard against just getting totally meaningless answers he 
said 
jordan was questioned about her contacts with thrift examiners 
on behalf of keating around the time of a key regulatory decision 
in may 1988 
the panel heard testimony last week that she called the federal 
home loan bank board to complain about a may 5 1988 plan to 
impose new regulatory controls on lincoln 
she acknowledged making the call and mentioning her contacts 
with keatings lobbyist jim grogan 
two weeks later the board eased its regulatory grip on lincoln 
the result of the boards change was that eventual takeover of 
lincoln was delayed and the cost of the taxpayers bailout of 
insured deposits was increased according to federal regulator 
william k black 
earlier she testified she found nothing unusual about 
cranstons meeting with regulators on behalf of keating 
she said she did not know until months later about the april 2 
1987 meeting that four of the senators including cranston held 
with then top thrift regulator edwin j gray on behalf of 
keatings lincoln savings and loan but she contended i didnt 
think it was unusual 
she testified that she was aware of a second meeting a week 
later that all five of the senators under investigation held with 
san franciscobased regulators she said she asked if she should 
plan to attend and cranston said the senators did not want aides 
present 
it didnt really strike me as unusual when he said it was 
about lincoln she said just in the back of my mind i assumed 
they were going to talk about some of the background information 
about the examination regulators were conducting at lincoln 
those meetings have emerged as crucial in the ethics panels 
investigation of allegations the five senators improperly 
intervened with regulators on behalf of keating 
jordan acknowledged visiting keatings american continental 
corp parent company in phoenix in late 1986 where she gave a 
speach to management and toured its facilities her trip was paid 
for by a californiabased thrift industry association she said 
and keatings company paid for her lodging 
that visit was just a few months before cranston attended the 
meetings on behalf of lincoln 
the ethics panel is investigating allegations the five senators 
improperly intervened with regulators on behalf of keating who 
contributed 13 million to the lawmakers and their causes 
in addition to cranston those under investigation are sens 
john mccain rariz sen dennis deconcini dariz john glenn 
dohio and donald riegle dmich 
keating has been charged in california with fraud stemming from 
the sale of junk bonds largely to elderly investors who became 
victims of the lincoln collapse

around kuwait in the past week expanding the iraqi armed force in 
the area to more than half a million soldiers the pentagon 
announced today 
the united states buildup also is continuing pentagon spokesman 
pete williams said today that an additional 10000 us troops have 
arrived in the persian gulf area since last week increasing the 
total us force there to 260000 
williams also said that more than 220000 ground sea and air

last week the pentagon said iraq had sent 480000 troops to 
kuwait and southern iraq that represented an increase of 30000 
from the week before 
williams described the latest additions to the iraqi force as 
a rounding out of existing brigades committed to the occupation 
of kuwait rather than the arrival there of newly activated 
brigades he said us intelligence sources had not detected any 
increase in the 4000 iraqi tanks in the area 
bush administration officials have cited the continuing buildup 
of iraqi forces in kuwait and southern iraq as a sign that 
president saddam hussein does not intend to comply with un 
resolutions demanding his withdrawal from kuwait 
defense secretary dick cheney said in a speech monday that 
saddam hussein has given us absolutely no indication whatsoever 
of any intention of withdrawing from kuwait and allowing the 
restoration of the exiled kuwaiti monarchy 
williams also disclosed today that the administration planned to 
ask allied nations such as germany japan and korea for additional 
financial contributions to help defray the cost of operation desert 
shield he said he could not say when the requests would be made 
nor by which member of the administration 
the pentagon meanwhile is continuing to add air and ground 
forces to operation desert shield 
the air force is sending more f15 eagle fighter jets to the 
persian gulf to expand us offensive capabilities against iraq 
and the army is ordering more national guard and reserve soldiers 
to active duty 
the pentagon announced on monday that elements of the 36th 
tactical fighter wing at bitburg germany will deploy to the middle 
east starting dec 28 officials declined to say how many of the 72 
planes based at bitburg are being sent 
the air force in recent days has disclosed deployments of a 
variety of additional aircraft to the gulf including f117a 
stealth fighterbombers f111 mediumrange bombers a10 tank 
killers and oa10 observation planes 
the additional aircraft are part of a broadbased reinforcement 
of us deployments in and around saudi arabia including more than 
100000 extra ground forces more than 30000 extra marines and 
three additional aircraft carrier battle groups tens of thousands 
of reservists are being called up to support the reinforcement 
the f15s from bitburg will give the united states greater 
airtoair combat capability in the event of war with iraq the 
aircraft are armed with sidewinder and sparrow missiles and a 20mm 
gatling gun 
an undisclosed number of f15s were dispatched to the gulf in 
august from the 1st tactical fighter wing at langley air force 
base va and from the 4th tactical fighter wing at seymour 
johnson air force base nc 
in its announcement the army said it ordered to active duty 
1457 members of national guard and reserve units in 20 states to 
provide a variety of support services including cargo transport 
medical service and civil affairs 
the army activations brought to 121940 the number of reservists 
called to active duty in all four services of that total 90186

americans 
two british chartered iraqi airways boeing 707s brought 240 
foreigners mostly britons from kuwait to the iraqi capital a 
third american charter returned to the iraqi capitial with only one 
irishman and two canadians aboard there were no americans on any 
of the flights from kuwait 
we must have gotten them all said one american consular 
official referring to earlier evacuation flights from the emirate 
and speaking on condition of anonymity

the white house said today that thursdays evacuation flight of 
americans from iraq and kuwait is likely to be the last and

been able to get out that we would remove the entire staff of the 
embassy said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
ambassador nathaniel howell and members of his staff had long 
defied iraqs orders following its aug 2 seizure of kuwait that 
they abandon the compound they and the british have had to cope

all americans have been evacuated 
not all of the estimated 600 us citizens left in iraq and 
kuwait were expected to leave diplomats said about 400 were 
expected to remain in iraq mainly people with dual usiraqi 
citizenship or american spouses of iraqi citizens 
british embassy officials said about 150 britons in iraq and 
kuwait intended to stay for various reasons

investigators removed a body from a paupers 
cemetery in a southern suburb today and plan to examine it to 
determine if it is that of candy heiress helen brach who 
disappeared 13 years ago 
federal state and county authorities were on the scene in 
willow springs but officials refused to comment immediately 
they were looking for the body of a woman found dead in woods in 
south suburban calumet city in 1978 according to reports in the 
chicago tribune 
it was not immediately clear whether authorities had exhumed the 
correct body 
we developed additional information which we felt significant 
enough to warrant a reexamination of the body jerry singer a 
spokesman for the us bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms 
said monday 
he declined to describe the new information 
mrs brach heiress to the brach candy co fortune disappeared 
at age 65 in 1977 in rochester minn 
her net worth then was estimated at 17 million her estate is 
now valued at more than 50 million after she was declared dead in 
1984 most of her money went to the helen brach foundation a 
charitable trust 
authorities want to conduct genetic testing on the body 
although cook county medical examiner robert j stein concluded in 
1978 that the body was not mrs brachs the unidentified body was 
then buried in a paupers cemetery 
the tribune citing unidentified sources said the dead woman 
was missing her hands and part of her face including her teeth 
that made it impossible to compare mrs brachs dental records with 
those of the body 
although singer declined to describe the new evidence the 
tribune reported the renewed interest in the case stemmed from a 
federal investigation in chicago into horse traders suspected of 
defrauding wealthy people the newspaper said a former boyfriend of 
mrs brachs figures in the probe 
one theory suggests that mrs brach was slain after she 
repeatedly complained to authorities that she had been defrauded in 
the purchase of horses the newspaper said 
mrs brach was the widow of frank v brach former head of the 
brach candy co he died in 1970

a new contraceptive touted by family planning 
experts as the most effective reversible method of birth control 
will soon be available to american women 
the food and drug administration approved norplant on monday 
clearing the way for wyethayerst laboratories to begin training 
health practitioners how to insert the implant that can prevent 
pregnancy for up to five years 
its going to be interesting to watch what kind of reaction 
norplant gets among the public and physicians said jeannie 
rosoff president of the alan guttmacher institute a research and 
policy group that focuses on reproductive health issues 
there are going to be some women for whom this is a godsend 
the numbers we dont know yet she said but any new addition 
that is safe is desirable 
susan dauley who underwent a test implant six years ago told a 
news conference in new york today she decided to do it again it 
just took a few minutes mrs dauley said you hardly feel 
anything 
family planning experts say norplant is the first major new 
contraceptive available to american women in three decades since 
the birth control pill was approved in 1960 and a new generation of 
intrauterine devices or iuds became available around that same 
time 
norplant was approved in finland in 1983 and has been approved 
in 15 countries since then half a million women in those countries 
have used it according to the population council which developed 
the device 
norplant consists of six thin flexible capsules each about an 
inch and a third long they are inserted in a fanlike arrangement 
under the skin of a womans inner arm above the elbow the minor 
surgical procedure is done in 10 to 15 minutes with local 
anesthesia in a doctors office or a clinic 
the capsules contain a hormone that is released slowly over five 
years the implants can be removed any time and fertility is 
quickly restored 
norplant is 99 percent effective for women weighing less than 
150 pounds it may be less effective in heavier women according to 
the council 
it will be marketed by wyethayerst laboratories of philadelphia 
and company officials expect the drug to be available commercially 
in february 
dr marc w deitch medical director at wyethayerst said the 
company wont discuss the cost of norplant until it goes on the 
market probably in february but he said it will cost less than 
five years worth of birth control pills 
thats the controlling factor said dr amy pollack 
associate medical director for the planned parenthood federation 
c wayne bardin vice president and director of medical research 
for the population council said last week he had been told the 
price would be in the range of 200 to 300 not including the cost 
of implanting the device 
one group for whom norplant is likely to be popular is women who 
have had all the children they want but arent sure they want to be 
sterilized 
sterilization is the leading method of birth control for married 
couples in the united states in 1988 in nearly 40 percent of 
married couples in which the woman was between 15 and 44 
sterilization was used according to the national center for health 
statistics 
many make that decision to be sterilized for lack of another 
choice pollack said 
some however may not like norplants side effect the major 
one is menstrual irregularities including prolonged periods and 
spotting between periods about 15 percent of the women who have 
the implant have it removed because of bleeding according to the 
councils studies 
other side effects include occasional headaches mood changes 
nausea and acne the fda said

the white house could unveil an economic 
assistance package for the soviet union as early as wednesday when 
president bush meets with soviet foreign secretary eduard a 
shevardnadze administration officials said today 
meanwhile a us study indicates there is no widespread hunger 
in the soviet union and adequate food supplies exist if 
authorities can just get it distributed 
administration officials speaking on the condition of 
anonymity said that an aid proposal that could include emergency 
food shipments was on bushs desk awaiting his final approval 
it is likely that bush will want to announce the steps on 
wednesday when the soviet official is here the sources said 
it was not immediately clear what the package would entail but 
bush has been considering lifting trade restrictions in place since 
1974 as well as a separate proposal to grant moscow 2 billion in 
loan guarantees to buy us food 
furthermore the package was expected to include emergency 
medical supplies and possibly direct food shipments particularly 
in light of shevardnadzes request in houston on monday for food 
an aid package for moscow is being discussed presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
fitzwater noted that baker and shevardnadze planned to hold a 
joint news conference later today and i dont want to prejudge 
any announcements 
however other officials said that while the package might be 
alluded to at the bakershevardnadze news conference specific 
details most likely would not be laid out until wednesday 
the administration said monday it is considering several ways to 
help the beleaguered soviets get through the winter including 
direct humanitarian aid as well as waiving longstanding trade 
restrictions to loosen up credit 
shevardnadze bluntly appealed for us aid before a meeting 
monday with baker 
we would appreciate if possible some food supplies he 
said in reply to a question from a reporter that is the most 
acute problem 
baker pledged a sympathetic response as far as humanitarian 
assistance medical assistance food and that sort of thing i know 
the president will be forthcoming with respect to trying to help 
the secretary said 
fitzwater said monday that bush is considering waiving trade 
restrictions imposed by the jacksonvanik amendment which was 
designed to punish the soviets for refusing to permit free 
emigration of jews 
bush had pledged to hold up granting the soviets 
mostfavorednation trade status until the soviet legislature 
passes new emigration legislation but the measure has been tied up 
for months partly due to concern among some soviets that it would 
lead to a brain drain a mass exodus of the troubled countrys 
besttrained people nonetheless jews are being permitted to leave 
in record numbers 
fitzwater said the administration was motivated by the soviets 
cooperation in the persian gulf crisis and by a very serious need 
in terms of their economy and in terms of their ability to get food 
supplies distributed to moscow and other major cities 
meanwhile a top state department official speaking on 
condition of anonymity said a us study of the soviet consumer 
goods shortage confirms there is no widespread hunger in the 
country and that adequate food is available if authorities can get 
it distributed 
the medical supply problem is deeper the official said 
and were looking at working with private groups to help relieve 
that situation americares a private relief agency recently 
announced it was dispatching 40 tons of medical supplies to the 
soviet union japan also has promised medical assistance 
although germany and several other western european countries 
are organizing food aid programs the us government still sees no 
immediate need for such relief the official said 
several european countries following the lead of the germans 
are shipping food to the soviets despite transportation logjams 
that have left many tons of supplies sitting on rail sidings with 
no place to unload 
several leaders have said the aid program is necessary to shore 
up soviet president mikhail gorbachev whose popularity and 
authority have been battered by the deepening crisis 
us observers say the europeans appear to be motivated at least 
partly by the fear that severe shortages coupled with the soviets 
easing of travel restrictions could cause a mass exodus of people 
fleeing the soviet union for the more prosperous countries of 
western europe 
gorbachev has pledged to crack down on black marketeering and 
boost food imports to ease the food crisis 
he installed a longtime kgb officer and an army general at the 
top of the interior ministry to tighten domestic control in the 
face of deteriorating order and growing squabbles with the 
countrys 15 republics and he announced formation of vigilante 
committees to crack down on theft and diversion of food supplies 
from established channels

hundreds of foreigners including about a dozen americans left 
iraq today as the exodus of hostages drew to a close but tensions 
remained high in the persian gulf as iraq and the united states 
both bolstered their forces 
earlier today two iraqi airways boeing 707s chartered by 
britain brought 240 foreigners mostly britons from kuwait to the 
iraqi capital 
a third american charter returned to the iraqi capitial with 
only one irishman and two canadians aboard there were no americans

in another development today the pentagon announced that iraq 
has placed 20000 more troops in and around kuwait in the past 
week expanding the iraqi armed force in the area to more than half 
a million soldiers 
the united states buildup also is continuing 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said today that an additional 
10000 us troops have arrived in the persian gulf area since last 
week increasing the total us force there to 260000 
williams also said that more than 220000 ground sea and air 
forces of other allied nations are arrayed against iraq these 
include forces from britain france egypt syria and several gulf 
nations including saudi arabia 
on monday president bush lashed out at saddam in a speech 
clearly aimed at limiting the iraqi presidents publicity gains 
from releasing foreign hostages 
what has happened to kuwait is more than an invasion bush 
said it is a systematic assault on the soul of a nation 
for months after his troops seized kuwait saddam prevented many 
foreigners from leaving iraq and kuwait sometimes freeing 
westerners only after receiving prominent emissaries from abroad 
last week he said all those who wanted to leave could do so 
iraqi information minister latif jassim meanwhile denied news 
reports that baghdad might withdraw from kuwait if it can keep the 
southern tip of the rumailah oil field which extends for two miles 
into kuwait before iraq overran kuwait on aug 2 saddam accused 
kuwait of overexploiting the field 
kuwait is iraqi whether in the past present or future and we 
will not compromise one iota on kuwaiti territory jassim said 
in his condemnation of iraqi atrocities bush drew on the 
reports of some of the hundreds of foreigners who have left iraq 
and kuwait 
they included hostages held as human shields at strategic 
sites and men who hid out in kuwait after the invasion 
more than 150 americans arrived at andrews air force base 
outside washington on monday and more than 500 other former 
hostages flew into london other flights carried foreigners to 
italy and jordan 
the experiences related by the hostages ranged from terrifying 
to unpleasant to tedious 
for the most part it was boring said gale rogers a 
consular officer at the us embassy in kuwait 
with fresh water and electricity cut off by the iraqis the 
americans were without air conditioning in the summer the air was 
hot with flies in the summer and cold with flies in the 
winter rogers said 
for tom kreuzman 38 of holiday fla the fourmonth period 
included 23 days hiding in a crawl space and eating dry spaghetti 
his scottish terrier chu chu accompanied kreuzman through the 
ordeal but was lost at baghdad airport on sunday he said 
its a tragedy said the former us air force serviceman 
who worked for the kuwaiti defense ministry as a technician on 
their hawk missile system she made it that far she went through 
a lot with me over there 
while iraq says the hostage release does not mean it will leave 
kuwait iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz said compromise could be 
reached on the dates for upcoming talks with the united states 
aziz was quoted by the new york times today as saying saddam was 
reconsidering his demand that secretary of state james a baker iii 
visit on jan 12 
us officials have said jan 12 would be too late because it 
falls three days before the deadline established by the un 
security council for iraq to quit kuwait or face the likelihood of 
being attacked 
president bush proposed the talks on nov 30 a day after the 
un resolution was approved and aziz is to travel to washington 
this month for talks with bush 
bush plans to have at least 400000 troops in the persian gulf 
region by midjanuary the multinational force arrayed against iraq

congressional investigators accused auditors 
at the environmental protection agency on tuesday of not 
aggressively pursuing potential fraud by private contractors 
involved in millions of dollars in environmental cleanup programs 
but the epas inspector general john martin 
told a house subcommittee he stands by his offices work and 
said its investigations have led to 250 indictments since 1984 as 
well as the recovery of 16 million in fines through administrative 
actions 
investigators for both the house energy and commerce committee 
and for the general accounting office testified that hundreds of 
epa contracts have not been audited because of backlogs and in 
some cases they said questions of possible fraud have not been 
pursued adequately 
three subcommittee investigators acknowledged however that 
their yearlong investigation uncovered no actual proof of fraud or 
evidence of deliberate wrongdoing by epa auditors 
this subcommittee is concerned that the public is not getting 
its moneys worth in environmental protection from these large 
contract expenditures said rep john dingell dmich chairman 
of the energy and commerce committee 
the panels subcommittee on oversight and investigation has been 
examining complaints about the work of the epas inspector 
generals office for more than a year 
a subcommittee report said the findings indicate that the igs 
office has failed to effectively pursue waste fraud and abuse 
that may be occurring by the agencys major private contractors 
the epa has contracts with private firms valued at more than 86 
billion many of them involving toxic waste cleanup under the 
superfund program 
the gao report said that most of epas contracts dating back 
four years have yet to be audited because of a backlog both within 
the epa and at the defense contract audit agency which handles may 
of the contract reviews for the agency 
the defense audit agency has 273 outstanding requests for 
contract audits from the epa as of the end of last month with 40 
percent of them made more than two years ago said the gao 
investigators 
of the more than 1 billion in contracts between the epa and six 
major private contractors between 1983 and 1990 only a small 
number have ever been audited said gao investigator richard 
hembra 
martin who has been the epas inspector general since late 
1983 said the congressional investigators have not found fraud 
they have not found anything wrong that we did not find 
already they found it in our files 
he strongly defended the agencys office of investigations 
saying they have no objective other than putting the bad guys in 
jail

police said tuesday they were ordered 
to arrest hussain muhammad ershad the president who was ousted 
last week in a popular uprising against what opponents called his 
corrupt government 
police put former home minister mahmudul hassan a close aide of 
ershad under house arrest and sought other former cabinet 
ministers and top officials in ershads government said a senior 
police officer 
most of ershads close associates went into hiding for fear of 
mob violence at least 12 homes were raided by police searching for 
them the officer said speaking on condition of anonymity 
another ranking officer said he expected ershad to be arrested 
early wednesday it was not clear whether he would be jailed or 
kept under guard at his exclusive home in the cantonment a 
restricted military area of dhaka 
ershad who has been in seclusion would not accept telephone 
calls from reporters tuesday 
the former general who seized power in a 1982 coup could face 
charges of subverting the constitution in connection with alleged 
vote rigging in two parliamentary elections and a presidential 
election he may also be accused of unlawful business deals 
according to opposition politicians who have pressed for his 
arrest 
as home minister mahmudul was in charge of the police and the 
paramilitary forces that tried to suppress seven weeks of often 
violent demonstrations seeking ershads resignation 
a member of ershads inner circle mahmudul was on the crisis 
team that advised ershad to decree a state of emergency on nov 27 
the measure failed to quell the street protests and ershad quit 
when the army also deserted him 
diplomatic sources estimated 60 people were killed in dhaka and 
another 40 in other trouble spots around the country most were 
shot by mahmuduls security forces 
five policemen armed with rifles tuesday stood inside the gate 
of mahmuduls enclosed home in the luxurious gulshan district in 
the capital other policemen were on patrol on the street 
the caretaker government headed by supreme court chief justice 
shahabuddin ahmed has been under intense pressure from political 
parties and university students to try ershad on charges of 
corruption and abusing power during his eightyear rule 
but a trial could involve tricky legal questions about 
presidential immunity and rake up emotions at a time when the 
country should prepare for its first free election in a decade the 
interim government is committed to holding a vote within three 
months 
shahabuddin privately discussed sending ershad into exile but 
the idea met a cool reception from most political parties which 
demanded a trial 
sheik hasina leader of the powerful awami league left the 
possibility open 
we want a bangladesh without ershad she said tuesday i 
dont mind if that is achieved by his arrest and trial or by 
throwing him out of the country 
the interim administration has removed civic leaders heads of 
public companies and at least three top army officers who were 
appointed by ershad or considered close to him

the chairman of the kgb security police said in a 
nationally televised speech today that foreign powers are backing 
radicals in the soviet union and he vowed to restore law and 
order 
forces are striving to achieve power kgb chairman vladimir 
kryuchkov said in an address that appeared to be the sharpest 
warning yet that president mikhail s gorbachev was planning a 
major crackdown 
democracy and glasnost will just remain beautiful words 
unless there is law and order in society said kryuchkov 
outlining part of gorbachevs campaign to curtail corruption and 
economic crimes 
gorbachev has ordered the kgb and other state security agencies 
to stem the flow of food and consumer goods from the centralized 
state distribution system 
authorities claim that the goods are showing up on the black 
market and that speculation is responsible for food shortages 
in the country 
despite the declared end to the cold war kryuchkov seemed to 
revert to th rhetoric of an earlier era in warning that foreign 
governments were encouraging radical elements in soviet society 
the growing of some ultraradical movements is not at all 
accidental but deliberate some of them have material and financial 
support from abroad he said without saying which foreign 
countries he was referring to

the british museums celebrated domed reading 
room where marx lenin and gandhi pondered ways to change the 
world will remain the hushed preserve of readers and thinkers the 
museum said tuesday 
the announcement ended half a century of argument over the fate 
of the reading room beloved by generations of scholars for its 
cerebral but cozy atmosphere 
the reading rooms 18 million books will be moved to the new 
british library in the next three years museum director sir david 
wilson announced 
but the circular chamber with its cathedralstyle windows and 
concentric rings of referencebook shelves will remain a reading 
room 
the room built in 1857 will even be redecorated in its 
original 19thcetury style 
i hope this will settle the argument wilson said 
the reading rooms fate had been uncertain since just after 
world war ii when the museum proposed to knock down 7 acres of 
surrounding historic bloomsbury for a new library and modern 
reading room 
the plan was quashed by the government in 1967 after objections 
from residents and conservationists 
in 1978 when the government approved building the new british 
library scheduled for completion in the mid1990s there was fresh 
uproar about the potential loss of the reading room 
devotees feared it would become just another display area in the 
museum or even face eventual demolition 
academics and writers set up a committee to keep the room as a 
library and prevent a considerable loss of amenity and historic 
connection 
karl marx and lenin used the reading room lenins application 
for a readers ticket needed to use the room is on display 
signed under his alias jacob richter 
the reading room was also a haunt of indian independence leader 
mohandas k gandhi playwright george bernard shaw historian 
thomas carlyle and novelist thomas hardy 
poet algernon swinburne once fainted in the reading room on 
being overcome by the close atmosphere an official recorded 
wilson made his announcement about the reading rooms future in 
unveiling an 155 million plan for using the new space the museum 
will acquire when the books are moved to the new national library 
half a mile away 
the redecoration of the room will also include a glass entrance 
for the public to see in he said 
after the reading rooms collection of books is moved wilson 
said some of the 100000 volumes belonging to the museums 
ethnography department would be housed there 
he also said books on one or two other subjects which are in 
demand would be available in the reading room and it will be 
open for study of any of the 8 million objects in the british 
museum he said 
the room is shaped like a bicycle wheel with a circular inquiry 
desk at the hub lines of reading desks radiate outward like 
spokes with 300 places for readers 
the circular interior wall under huge windows has three tiers 
of books with galleries running around them 
out of sight behind the walls are the 12 million books available 
to readers another 6 million books in the reading rooms 
collection are housed in 16 separate locations in london all 18 
million volumes will be united in the new library being built at a 
cost of 953 million

eight americans boarded a us chartered 
aircraft today in iraq leaving just three remaining to be 
evacuated so far as is known state department officials said 
the officials said they believe all other americans who wanted 
to leave iraq and kuwait have done so but another flight is 
scheduled for thursday to pick up any who may not have made their 
presence known to us officials 
that flight is likely to be the last said white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
we would anticipate that once all americans who want out have 
been able to get out that we would remove the entire staff of the 
embassy said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
other officials asking not to be identified said the three 
americans yet to be evacuated all were used as human shields 
and have not yet been allowed to leave because of visa problems 
no americans boarded the boeing 707 in kuwait today and eight 
got on in baghdad the officials said the flight then departed for 
frankfurt 
meanwhile those who came back to the united states on monday 
said they were relieved to be free after more than four 
frightening boring and unpleasant months as captives 
it feels absolutely great jack rinehart 37 of stover 
mo said several hours after he and more than 150 americans landed 
at nearby andrews air force base md on a chartered pan am jumbo 
jet 
its great to be back said dwight durmon of fayetteville 
tenn as he clutched the hand of his wife cathy 
at the white house today fitzwater noted that the second plane 
load of americans had left iraq about noon he said that those 
americans would be flown back to the united states on wednesday by 
military charter 
the final evacuation flight now scheduled for thursday is 
likely to be the last and it is also likely to be the one to 
evacuate us embassy personnel from kuwait fitzwater said 
while he adhered to a us policy of not revealing the number 
inside the besieged embassy in kuwait city fitzwater said 
suffice it to say its a small group 
he said that the united states technically would consider the 
embassy an active and open embassy available for work whenever we 
should want to do that 
but from a practical matter we wont have anyone there to 
raise the flag he added 
while the president is very happy to see the individual 
hostages being released he has watched some of it on television 
the president shares what im sure is everyones concern and 
disgust with some of the stories that are being told of harassment 
and deprivation during their captivity fitzwater said 
we watch this process with a certain amount of caution in the 
sense that its not completed yet and we wont be happy until 
everyone is out he added 
the first group of former hostages some of whom had been held 
as human shields at strategic sites in iraq left baghdad on 
sunday 
they spent the night in frankfurt germany before coming to the 
united states last week the iraqi parliament voted to allow the 
8000 american european and japanese hostages to go free 
mondays flight carried 156 people including four canadians 
fitzwater refused to say how many americans remained in iraq and 
kuwait 
ivan selin the state departments undersecretary for 
management greeted the evacuees they then were whisked away out 
of sight of hordes of reporters for private reunions with their 
families 
the exhostages spent the night in the capital and some said 
they expected to be debriefed by us officials 
rinehart an electrical engineer who was on a sales trip to 
kuwait when iraqi troops invaded the country aug 2 was holed up 
at the embassy compound for his entire stay 
i was the camp plumber said rinehart explaining how the 
embassy staff and the private citizens inside kept themselves 
occupied during the siege some people cooked cleaned and guarded 
the complex rinehart said he helped dig a 14foot water well 
for the most part it was boring said gale rogers a 
consular officer at the kuwait embassy 
life at the embassy also was uncomfortable without fresh water 
and electricity the americans were without air conditioning in the 
summer the air was hot with flies in the summer and cold 
with flies in the winter rogers said 
the americans ate mainly rice and tuna fish with different 
sauces a diet that caused rinehart to lose 25 pounds he said 
rogers of arlington va said the americans were afraid at 
times particularly right after the invasion the threat is there 
all the time if you cant go home and you cant leave he said 
but private citizens hiding in kuwait were even more frightened 
because they were subject to arrest and could be picked up in 
housetohouse searches many are afraid to sleep at night 
rogers said 
durmon said that in iraq people are afraid of the secret 
police the secret police there are surveilling you he said 
durmon said he was in kuwait but later was moved to iraq he 
declined to say what his job was 
those who left kuwait on sunday said the country is in chaos 
with roads destroyed street lights knocked out and wrecked cars 
everywhere everything is broken rogers said

the new chairman of the house science 
committee said tuesday that americas space station will be pushed 
into the next century if the broad changes sought by the 
administrations space advisory panel are implemented 
rep george brown dcalif called mondays recommendations of 
the advisory committee on the future of the us space program a 
reasoned balanced report both brown and his senate counterpart 
al gore dtenn plan hearings in january on the study 
commissioned by nasa and the white house 
the report recommended that reliance on the space shuttle be 
reduced and that plans for space station freedom be scaled down 
both in scope and mission it said too that nasa should 
concentrate on science not engineering spectaculars 
nasa already had switched orbital delivery of some cargoes from 
the space shuttle to unmanned singleuse rockets and most of the 
future shuttle missions are dedicated to science 
the sixth and last flight of 1990 landed in california early 
tuesday after nine days of astronomical observations with four 
telescopes it was the 13th mission since flight resumed in 1988 
nasa has scheduled seven flights in 1991 
brown elected by the house democratic caucus last week as 
chairman of the committee on science space and technology said 
that while the space future report is a good approach i lament 
that we are still in stage of going through reports 
reevaluations and redirections when the space program deserves 
stability and adequate resources 
in passing the nasa budget for 1991 congress also demanded that 
the space station be made smaller and less costly a move also 
recommended by the space future panel nasa is in the midst of a 
90day period of drawing up new designs 
another restructuring of the space station is going to make it 
impossible to maintain the present schedule brown said it 
probably means we wont even get started on building the station 
until the latter years of the 90s and there will be no occupancy 
until the 21st century 
the first shuttle flight to put hardware for the station into 
orbit had been scheduled for 1995 and the station was to have been 
permanently manned well before the year 2000 
this further complicates relationships with our partners in 
the station the japanese europeans and canadians who need to be 
fully involved and have to modify their own participation as a 
result of any changes we make brown said 
the next shuttle mission to deploy unclassified payloads for 
the air force and the strategic defense organization is planned 
for late february or early march a welcome hiatus to crews that 
had to handle three flights in as many months 
after these three i think christmas is going to be a real 
nice break said flight director bob castle well come back 
from christmas and be ready to go 
the planned 1991 missions include an april trip in which the 
gamma ray observatory is to be carried into orbit and in may a 
space life sciences laboratory is to ride aboard columbia 
discovery is to fly in july with another in a series of tracking 
and data relay satellites which gather information from other 
satellites and space shuttles and send it to the ground 
atlantis is to fly in august with several defense department 
payloads on a mission lasting 10 days discovery is scheduled again 
in november with the upper atmosphere research satellite and the 
final launch is that of atlantis in december carrying a manned 
scientific laboratory in its cargo bay 
the space future committee was headed by norman r augustine a 
veteran aerospace executive who is chairman and ceo of the martin 
marietta company 
commenting on the report nasa administrator richard truly 
pointed out that despite leaks that grounded the shuttle and flaws 
in the hubble space telescope nasa has averaged one launch in 
every two months since shuttles returned to flight in 1988 
he said it will not be difficult to adopt many of the 
recommendations in the report 
frankly i believe we are exactly in line with the augustine 
report and with congress he said

the national endowment for the arts has a 
special responsibility to protect freedom of artistic expression 
and should support promising new works that might prove risky or 
unpopular a nonpartisan forum affiliated with columbia university 
said tuesday 
the report by the american assembly also said the arts community 
was illequipped to deal with the recent controversy over alleged 
federal support for obscene and blasphemous works that once 
threatened the neas existence 
the public affairs forums report summarized a fourday 
conference of more than 70 business government foundation and 
arts leaders last month at arden house in harriman ny a copy was 
made available in washington 
the assembly was directed by stephen benedict former director 
of columbia universitys graduate program in arts administration 
and steven lavine president of the california institute of the 
arts at valencia participants included nea chairman john e 
frohnmayer john brademas president of new york university and 
andrew heiskell chairman of the new york public library and former 
chairman of time inc 
since the recent battle in congress over imposing antiobscenity 
restrictions on federal arts grants the forum said the nea has 
a specially compelling responsibility to protect freedom of 
expression not only for the artists it supports but for every 
artist 
the assembly leaders added that government policies and 
private actions that threaten to curb artistic speech or to 
constrict in any way the marketplace of ideas for the arts have no 
place in american society and must be vigorously opposed 
the report noted that the nea controversy was triggered by its 
grants for exhibitions of sexually explicit photographs by the late 
robert mapplethorpe and works by artist andres serrano that were 
accused of being antireligious 
government arts programs should support new work of promise 
that may prove risky or unpopular the forum said some art has 
always been controversial and will continue to be especially as 
cultures and art forms become more diverse and the boundaries of 
art continue to expand 
the assembly leaders said government grants must be administered 
on the principle that no artists work may be compromised 
suppressed or unrecognized because of race ethnicity gender 
sexual preference or political or religious beliefs 
the forum said the arts community must overcome its differences 
and develop new ways to build the case for public support of the 
arts it recommended a coalition with corporate executives willing 
to serve as arts advocates with all levels of government 
arts advocacy can only succeed if all participants in the 
process refrain from asserting their interests at the expense of 
others the forum said 
in october congress repealed strict antiobscenity curbs on the 
nea and voted instead to penalize grant recipients whose federally 
subsidized works are ruled obscene by the courts 
legislation extending the neas statutory authority for three 
years with a firstyear budget of 174 million also required the 
nea chairman to ensure that grant awards take into account 
general standards of decency 
members of the national council on the arts the presidentially 
appointed advisory body to the nea will confer informally this 
weekend to discuss how the new decency guideline will affect 
the endowments grantmaking decisions

the communist victory in serbias 
first free vote since 1938 creates a new crisis for yugoslavias 
unity 
the nations fate hinges on whether the republics hardline 
president chooses dialogue or conflict with his political 
adversaries in croatia and slovenia 
the two northern republics moves for more independence or even 
secession have angered slobodan milosevic who defeated 
centerright candidates in serbias presidential elections sunday 
he is a leader of serbias communists who renamed themselves the 
socialist party 
the socialists also were leading in serbias parliamentary 
ballot 
milosevics victory seems certain to widen the political gap 
between north and south speeding the drive for independence in the 
westernminded republics it is also likely to keep ethnic 
albanians living in the once semiautonomous kosovo province under 
direct serbian rule 
we now consider serbia a sort of foreign partner for 
negotiation said slaven letica a chief adviser to croatias 
centerright president franjo tudjman 
we are willing to discuss to try and resolve the yugoslav 
crisis and we now consider milosevic a democratically elected 
president but we dont know if he will negotiate with us letica 
said 
tudjmans nationalistoriented croatian democratic union ousted 
communists in spring elections in croatia he has allied against 
milosevic with slovenia where centerright government parties also 
defeated communists at the polls 
the northerners parliaments have flouted federal laws and 
proposed transforming yugoslavia into a loose conferedation with a 
common market serbia favors keeping power centralized in belgrade 
the federal and serbian capital 
before years end croatia is to adopt a new constitution that 
would pave the way for independence 
slovenia holds a plebiscite dec 23 on whether to stay in the 
federation the vote is seen as a last bargaining card to force 
serbia to negotiate on decentralization 
a survey published in slovenias leading daily delo following 
serbias sunday election indicated that 90 percent of slovenians 
plan to vote in the referendum only 1 percent said they opposed 
independence 
people here invested a lot of hope in those elections hoping 
things would change zoran thaler slovenias deputy foreign 
minister said of the serbian balloting now we see it wont be 
different 
yugoslavia was formed from the wreckage of the hapsburg and 
ottoman empires in 1918 as the kingdom of serbs croats and 
slovenes it held its last free elections in 1938 
the nation was reassembled during world war ii as a communist 
republic only singleparty elections were held after 1943 
like the rest of the balkans yugoslavia is plagued by ancient 
unresolved ethnic conflicts exacerbated by historic and economic 
divisions 
milosevic has ruled serbia the largest of yugoslavias six 
republics with a firm hand since late 1987 
before sundays election he refused to publicly acknowledge the 
possibility of the federations breakup or discuss the issue with 
slovenia and croatia its unclear whether he will talk now with 
tudjman or slovenias president milan kucan 
we dont know if milosevic after the elections will be the 
same milosevic as before the elections said one central european 
diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity 
western diplomats say serbia might agree to slovenian secession 
to deprive croatia of a political ally 
it would be possible for tiny alpine slovenia whose 2 million 
people are ethnically homogeneous to make a clean break without 
raising the countrys ethnic tensions to a boiling point 
but croatia home to 500000 ethnic serbs could not a 
secession attempt could push the southern slavs into civil war 
milosevic has said any attempts by croatia to pull out of the 
federation would force serbia to redraw its borders to protect its 
minorities 
the central republic of bosniahercegovina whose patchwork 
population of serbs croats and moslems make it a miniature 
yugoslavia likely would split along national lines in an armed 
conflict 
yugoslavia has always seemed able to pull itself back from the 
brink of selfdestruction but maybe not this time said a 
western diplomat 
the federal army whose officer corps is dominated by serbs and 
their traditional allies from montenegro has indicated it could 
intervene in slovenia to preserve federal unity 
slovenias government controls only a small local militia and 
plans to appeal for western diplomatic assistance if that happens 
but anything other than symbolic help is unlikely 
if soviet president mikhail gorbachev sent troops into the 
baltics the west wouldnt lift a finger so why should they help

lithuanias president said tuesday that moscow 
will try to bring his rebellious republic to its knees this winter 
by cutting off all supplies of food and raw materials 
president vytautas landsbergis told a news conference that 
soviet officials have informed his government that food fodder 
energy and material shipments to lithuania will end on jan 1 
ostensibly because of shortages in the soviet union 
all forces and all measures are going to be used to 
destabilize the situation in lithuania and force it to remain part 
of the soviet union they hope general winter will be on their 
sidelandsbergis said 
he said citizens in his baltic state have begun storing reserves 
for expected shortages and i am convinced this winter is going to 
be a decisive one in our struggle 
landsbergis met monday with president bush and was meeting vice 
president dan quayle on tuesday to appeal for us support in 
lithuanias drive to cast off soviet rule and become an independent 
state 
bush restated us policy urging selfdetermination for the 
baltic states and a peaceful settlement to their differences with 
moscow landsbergis said he was confident bush would not sacrifice 
lithuania to keep soviet leader mikhail gorbachev in power 
asked if washington might overlook the soviet use of force 
against lithuania in its eagerness to hold together the antiiraq 
coalition he said especially after my meeting with president 
bush i have absolutely no basis to think that way 
but landsbergis also criticized the west in general for failing 
to see soviet pressure against lithuania as an act of aggression 
he said the west gave in to the soviets in not allowing the three 
baltic republics of lithuania estonia and latvia to send 
representatives to a 35nation european conference in paris two 
weeks ago 
he compared the situation in lithuania which was invaded and 
annexed by stalin in 1940 with that of occupied kuwait no one 
believes saddam hussein when he says kuwait is eternally going to 
be part of iraq he said 
last march the lithuanian parliament voted to declare 
independence from moscow which followed by imposing an economic 
embargo on lithuania that lasted about three months 
the latest dispute erupted in november when the three baltic 
states rejected a soviet plan that would give moscow control over 
budgetary financial and tax matters and require that almost all 
foreign currency earnings be turned over to the central government 
landsbergis said the dispute is behind the latest boycott threat 
there is no question that people will suffer if another 
blockade is enforced he said adding he hoped assistance from 
the west will not be limited to the sending of medicine 
landsbergis also expressed concern about gorbachevs appointment 
earlier this month of former kgb general boris pugo to the interior 
ministers post 
he said pugo considered a hardliner represents a group of 
people for whom the survival of the empire is much more important 
than social and economic reforms 
landsbergis said he planned to meet soviet prime minister 
nikolai ryzhkov in moscow thursday he said he would discuss the 
threatened economic blockade but that his primary purpose would be 
to lay the groundwork for stalled negotiations with moscow on the 
republics eventual independence

soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
will meet in washington with israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir 
a move that could enhance relations between the two countries us 
officials said here today 
shevardnadze is winding up two days of meetings here with 
secretary of state james a baker iii one of the main topics is 
the crisis in the persian gulf 
the soviets have held out the prospect of resuming normal 
relations with israel after a 23year break they have exchanged 
diplomats but formal ties remain broken since the 1967 mideast war 
the session will give shevardnadze a chance to try to persuade 
shamir to agree at least in principle to a mideast peace 
conference the prime minister objects arguing that the soviets 
might line up with the arabs and try to impose unacceptable terms 
on israel 
shevardnadze and baker changing plans decided to head back to 
washington tuesday night instead of wednesday morning one reason 
said the us officials who demanded anonymity was to give 
shevardnadze more time to get to see shamir who visited president 
bush today 
baker will meet with shamir thursday 
the bush administration has stood alongside israel in trying to 
forestall a drive by arab and neutral governments to hold a peace 
conference in which the palestinians complaints against israeli 
occupation of the west bank and gaza could be considered 
baker has said a conference would be useful only at an 
appropriate time and properly structured he said those 
circumstances were not right at this point 
also baker wants to avoid linking the israelipalestinian 
dispute with the usled drive to force iraq to leave kuwait

against arab nations contributing to the mutinational force 
deployed in saudi arabia

the nations foreign trade deficit hurt by 
higher oil prices and increased military spending from the persian 
gulf crisis widened a sharp 139 percent in the julyseptember 
quarter the government said tuesday 
the commerce department said the 256 billion third quarter 
deficit was up from a second quarter deficit of 225 billion it 
was the largest quarterly imbalance since a 267 billion gap in 
the final three months of 1989 
the new report covered the current account which is considered 
the most important yardstick of the countrys international 
performance because it measures not only trade in merchandise but 
also trade in services and investment flows between countries 
the higher deficit in the julyseptember quarter was viewed as 
especially ominous because an improving trade balance had been the 
only bright spot in a lackluster economy this year 
a rising trade deficit would make the recession many economists 
believe has already started even steeper by removing the strength 
that export growth has provided to the manufacturing sector over 
the past several years 
a lot of people are looking to exports as the key to 
moderating the severity of the recession and helping to pull the 
country out of the downturn said howard lewis a trade expert at 
the national association of manufacturers 
cynthia latta an economist with drimcgraw hill predicted the 
trade deficit for this year would hover around 100 billion and 
would remain stuck at that level in 1991 as well 
before iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait sent oil prices soaring 
some analysts had forecast that the trade deficit for this year 
could drop as low as 90 billion which would have been the 
smallest imbalance since 1983 
for the third quarter the primary weakness came from a 29 
percent jump in the merchandise trade deficit which rose to 2975 
billion as imports hit an alltime high more than half of the 
increase in imports reflected higher petroleum prices 
another factor contributing to the increase in the third quarter 
deficit was a rise in direct spending for us military operations 
overseas which climbed to 431 billion a 17 percent increase 
reflecting the troop buildup in the middle east 
that increase lowered the overall services balance to 58 
billion in the third quarter 
in one bright spot in the report the balance on investment 
earnings shifted into a surplus of 246 billion reflecting 
improved earnings by americans on their overseas investments that 
had been in deficit by 1 billion in the second quarter 
the other component of the current account unilateral transfer 
payments primarily foreign aid payments and government pension 
payments to americans living overseas increased the deficit by 
411 billion in the third quarter 
the current account trade deficit is closely watched because it 
translates directly into the amount of money america must borrow 
from overseas to cover the shortfall between what the united states 
exports in goods and services and what it imports 
a decade ago america was the largest creditor nation it ran 
surpluses in its current account as the earnings from its overseas 
investments were enough to offset perennial deficits in merchandise 
trade 
but as americans handed over billions of dollars to foreigners 
to pay for imported merchandise the investment cushion eroded and 
disappeared altogether in 1985 when the united states became a net 
debtor for the first time in 71 years 
that means foreigners now own more in us assets than americans 
own overseas at the end of 1989 the countrys net debtor position 
was put at 6637 billion and economists believe that figure will 
grow by another 100 billion this year

the treasury department said tuesday that 
despite progress in canada and europe in easing barriers to us 
financial institutions serious obstacles remain in japan and some 
other asian and latin american countries 
progress in reducing barriers abroad is occurring at a varied 
pace but generally not as rapidly as the treasury would like 
secretary nicholas f brady said in a report to congress on foreign 
treatment of us financial institutions 
the 506page national treatment study describes how us firms 
are permitted to operate overseas particularly whether they are 
able to operate on equal grounds with their domestic competitors 
significant progress has been made in canada and most european 
countries and within the european community treasury 
undersecretary david c mulford told reporters at a briefing 
but he said that while theres been some progress in japan it 
has been disappointingly slow and incomplete as of this time and 
fundamental problems still remain 
in other asian countries such as korea and taiwan progress 
has been inadequate and serious barriers to us financial firms 
exist he continued we are concerned about denials of national 
treatment in latin america 
the study describes national treatment as equality of 
competitive opportunity it notes the united states long has been 
a strong advocate of the principal and thefree international

the murder trial of marlon brandos 
son was scheduled for january although a defense lawyer said key 
prosecution witness is confined under a suicide watch in a tahiti 
hospital 
christian brando made a brief court appearance tuesday and 
answered yes when superior court judge robert thomas asked if 
he agreed to have his murder trial postponed to jan 14 the trial 
was first set for nov 5 
a hearing is expected later this month to determine whether 
another judge will request for french assistance in returning 
christian brandos 20yearold sister from the polynesian territory 
to testify in his trial 
defense attorney robert shapiro told reporters tuesday that 
cheyenne brando who was with her brother in the hours before he 
shot her tahitian lover has been placed in isolation 
the trial date was set after miss brandos mother was named as 
her guardian 
she is being confined in an isolated unit because another 
suicide is contemplated shapiro said shes a danger to 
herself this is a person i couldnt anticipate would be a 
competent witness in this or any other proceeding 
prosecutors however said they have learned that miss brando 
was declared incapacitated rather than incompetent by the 
tahitian court that appointed her guardian they indicated this 
signals a temporary condition rather than a permanent one 
miss brandos family has said she took a drug overdose and 
recovered but two weeks later hanged herself only to be saved by 
her mother before she died 
christian brando 32 told police he accidentally shot dag 
drollet 26 during a struggle may 16 at the actors mansion 
miss brando fled to tahiti a month after drollets death and 
gave birth to his child she has refused to return to california to 
testify 
authorities in tahiti also have barred her exit charging her as 
an accomplice in drollets slaying 
miss brandos version of events has never been clear she has 
given at least five depositions in the united states and tahiti 
but shapiro says they have contained conflicting accounts

a former bolivian interior minister organized his 
country as a forprofit cocaine haven federal prosecutors said 
tuesday as they opened their drug trafficking case against luis 
arce gomez 
attorneys for arce gomez countered that he was hard on drugs 
and had made powerful enemies for his anticorruption efforts 
arce gomez a colonel in the bolivian army in the early 1980s 
and minister of the interior in what was then the countrys 
military government was indicted on drugtrafficking charges in 
1983 
prosecutor michael p sullivan told the jurors that arce gomez 
and others in bolivia and the united states conspired in 1980 to 
import and distribute cocaine into the united states with bolivian 
government figures being paid for protecting trafficking 
sullivan said testimony would come from arce gomez codefendant 
and former lieutenant herland echeverria barrancos 39 who pleaded 
guilty monday in a plea bargain to one count of conspiracy to 
import drugs 
echeverrias job was to arrange protection and collect money 
from traffickers prosecutors said 
defense attorney stephen finta described arce gomez 52 as a 
very popular leader dedicated to his country but arce gomez made 
enemies when he became interior minister because he fought 
corruption after his predecessors regarded the ministry as their 
own private piggybank finta said 
arce gomez was also tough on drug traffickers finta said and 
advocated the death penalty for them 
arce gomez was extradited to the united states last december on 
the 1983 drugtrafficking indictment but the case was quickly 
overshadowed by the invasion of panama and the arrest of former 
panamanian leader manuel noriega 
arce gomez is also charged with human rights violations in 
bolivia allegedly organizing death squads with the help of klaus 
barbie the nazi butcher of lyon later extradited to france as 
a war criminal 
the first prosecution witness called was alex pacheco a 
confessed drug dealer who allegedly plotted with arce gomez and 
others to bring about the 1980 military coup that overthrew 
bolivias civilian government 
pacheco said his job was to arrange for protection payments from 
cocaine traffickers 
in the indictment arce gomez echeverria and 17 others were 
accused of accepting as much as 75000 every two weeks to look the 
other way as drug traffickers moved in and out of bolivia a prime 
source of coca 
they also allegedly seized cocaine from uncooperative 
traffickers and once took 15 million for releasing confiscated 
cocaine held in bolivian government vaults investigators say 
arce gomez was forced out of the military government in 1981 
under us pressure and fled to argentina he left that country 
after its military government fell and was arrested on a ranch at 
santa cruz bolivia bolivian authorities immediately flew him to 
the united states

a connecticut woman whose assault by her 
husband generated a landmark damage award said tuesday that hes 
going to find me when he is released from prison perhaps as 
early as next year 
i fear most of all that by being in prison this long its 
only made him more of an animal and more angry tracey motuzick 
of torrington conn told the senate judiciary committee while 
testifying on behalf of legislation designed to stiffen protections 
against domestic violence 
because of what ive experienced with him i know hes going 
to find me said motuzick 
motuzick formerly tracey thurman won a 26 million judgment 
with her theninfant son after claiming in 1985 that torrington 
police violated her rights by failing to protect her from her 
estranged husband charles 
she was left partially paralyzed after he stabbed her 13 times 
on june 10 1983 and kicked her in the head the damage award was 
reduced to 197 million in negotiations after the police officers 
appealed said her attorney burton weinstein 
thurmans attorney said during a parental rights dispute a few 
years ago that the defendant had no intention of harming his former 
wife after his release 
the case was the subject of a 1989 television movie called a 
cry for help the tracey thurman story the original verdict was 
heralded as a landmark for battered women by the national 
organization for women and was considered by attorneys to be the 
first time a federal court allowed a wife to sue police for damages 
in a domestic dispute 
charles thurman was sentenced to 15 years in prison for the 
assault but with time off for good behavior his release date is 
listed as december 1991 by state corrections officials he may also 
face at least several months more for a 1981 probation violation 
officials said 
weinstein said in telephone interview tuesday that im going 
to do my best to build the tightest fence possible and appropriate 
security measures will be taken we will take every precaution 
motuzick testified on behalf of a bill drafted by sen joseph 
biden ddel which would make it a federal crime to cross state 
lines to continue spousal abuse provide new funding for battered 
women shelters and make stayaway orders enforceable in states 
other than the one where the order originated 
her voice quavered when motuzick told the panel my son and i 
will always be affected by what happened to us but this was 
preventable if the police had taken my calls seriously 
motuzick sat at a witness table next to charlotte fedders whose 
spousal abuse case was also the subject of a television movie as 
well a book herhhusband john is the former enforcement chief of 
the securities and exchange commission 
fedders said she endured 17 years of black eyes bruises and a 
broken ear drum domestic violence occurs in all economic 
cultural racial and religious groups she said

from politicians in chartered planes to 
peasants on horseback thousands have converged on this village 
deep in the amazon for a murder trial that some say could shape the 
future of the worlds largest rain forest 
two cattle ranchers accused of killing union leader and renowned 
amazon defender chico mendes are expected to go on trial beginning 
wednesday nearly two years after mendes was gunned down 
but already the village of pastelcolored wood cabins about 
2650 miles miles northwest of rio de janeiro is buzzing with 
speculation and a sense of fear over the final judgment 
local residents many of whom survive by harvesting rubber and 
nuts from the forest see the trial as symbolizing the battle 
between the poor seeking collective use of the rain forest against 
landowners and ranchers who want to cut it down 
private and government development efforts in the amazon region 
have intensified since 1980 and estimates on deforestation range 
from from about 5 percent to 12 percent the rain forest about 
twice the size of alaska is the only habitat for many of the 
worlds plant and animal species 
this is a historic trial not only in brazil but in the 
world said chief prosecution lawyer marcio thomaz bastos in 
brazil it is a test case of reckless lawlessness and for the 
whole world it is an indicator of whether or not man will allow 
the amazon to be destroyed 
mendes a 44yearold rubber tapper who led a movement to stop 
destruction of the rain forest was killed by a shotgun blast on 
dec 22 1988 as he stepped out of the back door of his humble 
wood house in xapuri 
rancher darly alves da silva and his 23yearold son darci are 
charged with planning and executing the crime they were being held 
in the acre state prison in rio branco the capital of this far 
western amazon state 
the two were to be flown to xapuri by helicopter under heavy 
guard 
about 2000 peasants from all over the region are descending on 
this town in canoes muledrawn carts on horseback and on foot 
people are setting up tents hammocks and mattresses in the spare 
rooms or porches of relatives or friends 
rubber tappers traveled up the acre river more than 50 miles to 
attend the trial 
if darly and darci are found not guilty only god will be able 
to save our town in the rain forest said raimundo da silva maia 
a 51yearold tapper 
hundreds of politicians including some government officials and 
many representatives of leftist workers party of which mendes was a 
member began to arrive late tuesday aboard chartered planes and 
buses from rio branco 110 miles away 
more than 100 state troopers were flown in to prevent violence 
between ranchers residents and rubber tappers roadblocks of 
heavily armed police were set up along the muddy rutted road that 
connects xapuri to rio branco 
judge adair longhini said at least a dozen heavily armed 
troopers would surround the small wooden courthouse near the main 
square 
but many residents doubted the security measures would be enough 
to guarantee a violencefree trial 
were worried the trial will trigger violence not stop it 
said ilzamar mendes the widow of chico mendes 
darly has had messages sent to us saying he would take his 
revenge whether he was released or not she said 
in the meantime the town is bustling to accommodate the crush 
of visitors brandnew public telephones are sprouting on street 
corners sidewalk curbs park benches and trees trunks are getting 
fresh coats of green and white paint 
banners are strung over the brick streets reading justice for 
all and save the amazon 
we are waiting to see if justice will finally be served 
said amini de carvalho santana 26 a drugstore clerk the forest 
and the people who live in it will be destroyed without justice

its safe enough to ski on but authorities 
say its not a good idea to eat any of the snow from vails 
snowmaking operations which use water that is partly from treated 
sewage 
water intakes for snowmaking in the rocky mountains resort 70 
miles west of denver are less than 100 yards downstream from a 
sewage plants outflow into gore creek 
when the creek runs low regulators let vails snowmaking crews 
take only the same amount of water from the creek that the sewage 
plant is pumping in 
as a result state officials say onethird to twothirds of 
vails manmade snow is water from the sewage plant 
would i eat that snow knowing what i know probably not 
said jay skinner a colorado division of wildlife official who 
monitors resort snowmaking and its effect on streams i know it 
should be treated ok but i wouldnt drink whats coming out the 
effluent pipe either 
if it was a problem youd think someone in government would 
have told us said joe macy vails ski mountain planner but 
the state accepted this agreement 
the vail sewage plant actually is one of the states cleanest 
because it uses tertiary treatment the most stringent method 
health officials said 
but last winter it still released up to 368 parts per million 
of fecal coliform bacteria and up to 11 ppm of ammonia far in 
excess of drinking water standards

defeated presidential challenger stanislaw 
tyminski got permission tuesday to leave poland presidentelect 
lech walesa paid homage at the countrys holiest shrine and 
incumbent president gen wojciech jaruzelski bade the nation 
farewell 
tyminski 42 had been ordered to remain in poland pending 
investigation of slander charges against him but he told reporters 
tuesday night he had obtained permission to return temporarily to 
his children and home in canada after posting a 100000 bond 
tyminski said he would depart wednesday morning but he pledged 
to return to poland by jan 5 
i would like to see my children tyminski said and i 
would like to rest after the campaign 
jaruzelski in a farewell speech broadcast on nationwide 
television tuesday night apologized for each harm pain and 
injustice during his nine years in power apparently referring 
to his 1981 decision to impose martial law to quash solidarity and 
the years of repression that followed 
the word of sorry may sound all too casual jaruzelski 
said but i cannot find another one 
he said however that he was guided by the good of the 
country and by a will to spare poland a tragedy and its people 
excessive suffering 
jaruzelski as head of the communist party was polands leader 
from october 1981 until july 1989 when he was elected president 
an office whose powers he used only passively his term will end 
when walesa is sworn in expected dec 21 
the announcement that tyminski could leave followed a 
threehour 25minute meeting in warsaw with two prosecutors from 
the southern province of nowy sacz tyminski said he had not 
retracted his allegation against the government of treason and 
of betraying the citizens by creating economic chaos 
i do not regret what i said tyminski said tuesday and i 
am ready to bear all the consequences 
he added i cannot change what i said 
prosecutors on monday ordered the emigre businessman be barred 
from leaving the country pending a dec 17 hearing 
polish law provides for jail terms of six months to eight years 
for those who demean the top state authorities prosecutors 
have said 
tyminski said he and his peruvianborn wife planned to leave 
wednesday morning for the toronto home where they lived until this 
fall when tyminski returned to his native poland and decided to 
run for president 
tyminski said he would go for three days to see his children 
and to prepare his defense using videotapes of the nov 17 speech 
that are in canada 
meanwhile walesa the election victor made an emotional 
pilgrimage to the 14thcentury jasna gora monastery in czestochowa 
135 miles southwest of warsaw 
queen of poland in this historic moment i stand before you at 
the very sources of my faith walesa said before the black 
madonna the jewel encrusted icon whose image the solidarity chief 
always wears on his lapel 
assuming the office of president of the fair republic of 
poland conscious of my responsibilities to god the nation 
history and my conscience he pledged to protect the dignity 
sovereignty and security of poland and devote myself 
entirely to the nation 
his homage recalled the sanctuary provided by churches 
nationwide to solidarity activism when the union was banned by the 
communists 
in rome polishborn pope john paul ii sent his congratulations 
to walesa and pleaded for unity during polands difficult 
postcommunist transition 
at solidaritys gdansk headquarters the unions national 
commission considered the procedure to name a new chairman an 
special nationwide congress was proposed for as early as 
midjanuary 
after a campaign that strained polands new democracy and 
registered discontent with its difficult course toward economic 
reform walesa received 7425 percent of the vote sunday to 2575 
percent for his darkhorse challenger in the presidential runoff 
election 
walesa who has already started consulting with advisers on 
naming a new prime minister is to be sworn in for a fiveyear term 
by parliament 
tyminski said on tuesday that he would not contest the results 
despite allegations sunday night that supporters had been 
intimidated and some people had their dogs poisoned 
tyminski who has canadian peruvian and polish citizenships 
said he was unsure whether he will found a political party 
the leader of the fringe libertarian party of canada and owner 
of computer businesses tyminski portrayed himself as a 
ragstoriches story but his firstround success was derailed 
before sundays runoff by questions about his connections with 
former communist operatives and his vagueness of his promises for 
quick economic recovery

hartz mountain corp will pay 45000 to 
settle charges that it failed to report pet illnesses and deaths 
from a topselling flea and tick repellent the environmental 
protection agency said tuesday 
the pet product giant agreed to pay half the original 90000 in 
penalties but admitted no liability according to a statement 
epa said the fines stemmed from a 1987 investigation into 
complaints from veterinarians and consumers about blockade sprays 
for dogs and cats 
agency spokesman al heier said the animals were absorbing the 
pesticides into their skins and suffered tremors vomiting and 
convulsions young kittens and old cats were the most susceptible 
but often recovered if they were bathed he said 
the illinoisbased national animal poison information network 
told epa that by the end of 1987 the year the product went on the 
market it had reports of 496 incidents including 75 deaths 
heier said 
harrison njbased hartz mountain placed warnings on its 
labels in 1987 then voluntarily removed the product in 1988 to 
conduct more extensive testing heier said blockade was 
reintroduced in 1989 
epa did not bring its formal 18count complaint until jan 31 
hartz spokesman william pearlberg said the company was most 
surprised at the complaint believing it had reported all 
required information in a timely manner 
registered pesticide producers must pass on health complaints to 
epa within a reasonable period epa defined that as a month in 
the blockade case epa attorney scott garrison said 
we did not consider it to be reporting when we had to send 
inspectors out to get it garrison said 
heier said blockade flea and tick repellents contain a 
combination of the pesticides deet and fenvalerate 
there is some danger in the product heier said however 
from our information it shows the risks of using blockade is no 
greater than using any other pet product 
according to heier the revised label directs consumers not to 
use blockade on cats less than a year old on pregnant cats or on 
puppies younger than 3 months 
hartz mountain maintains the formula is effective in preventing 
insectborne diseases

of international piracy for airlifting hundreds of libyan 
prisoners of war out of chad 
us troops evacuated about 600 libyan pows held by the former 
chadian government on friday and saturday as victorious rebels 
consolidated their control of chad 
the united states has said the evacuation was part of a 
humnitarian gesture with international backing 
in another development libya said tuesday it has asked iraq to 
hand over some american hostages to be held in exchange for the 
former libyan prisoners of war taken from chad the report came 
from libyas official jana news agency monitored in rome 
but iraqs information minister has said iraq will not hand over 
any americans us and other foreign hostages were freed under a 
blanket decree by iraqi president saddam hussein and have been 
leaving the iraqi capital on evacuation flights 
in the evacuation of the pows libya said us troops threatened 
to kill any libyan who refused to go 
the libyans were flown to nigeria that countrys foreign 
minister confirmed on tuesday other former pows returned to libya 
which helped arm the rebels 
libya has accused the united states of training the pows to 
destabilize col moammar gadhafis libyan government and called 
for an emergency meeting of the security council to discuss the 
matter 
yemen currently holds the presidency of the council yemeni 
ambassador abdalla saleh alashtal said the council may meet on the 
request wednesday 
libyan foreign minister ibrahim bashari said the libyans were 
put on a us air force plane against their will and against 
their wishes under the protection of the french forces stationed 
at ndjamena chads capital 
in his letter to secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
which was released tuesday bashari said the prisoners were 
forcibly removed having been threatened subject to the use of 
weapons by united states agents and with the cooperation of the 
french forces that whoever refused to leave would be killed and 
his body thrown onto the road 
this act of international piracy by the united states 
constitutes a violation of the sovereignty of an independent 
state bashari said 
his letter gave no indication of how he learned the alleged 
details of the evacuation 
the us mission to the united nations has had no comment on the 
libyan accusations the french mission had no immediate comment 
chadian forces captured the libyan fighters in clashes in 1983 
and 1987 chad and libya have battled on and off in a border 
dispute for more than 20 years 
the international committee of the red cross complained monday 
in geneva that it was not allowed to supervise the airlift and said 
it wanted to interview the prisoners to make sure they left 
voluntarily 
the icrc has not been able to carry out protection work on 
their behalf as it would have wished it said in a statement 
the red cross said it was never allowed to visit libyan 
prisoners captured during the long conflict between chad and libya 
despite repeated requests to chads former government led by 
president hissene habre 
idriss debys rebel forces toppled habre this month deby is now 
interim president 
nigerias foreign minister gen ike nwachukwo told reporters 
tuesday that the red cross had asked his country to take in the

the operator of the savannah river nuclear 
arms plant has not decided when to ask federal permission to 
restart a reactor despite a published report the request will be 
made this summer a company spokesman said 
specific recommendations are far from being finalized said 
jack n herrmann public relations spokesman for the westinghouse 
savannah river co 
the augusta chronicle reported tuesday that westinghouse said in 
a 250page report to be submitted to the department of energy that 
it plans to request permission to begin fullpower operation for 
the kreactor between june 30 and july 9 
the newspaper did not report when westinghouse wants to start 
the reactor but said testing could begin as early as june 3 
savannah river sites three aging reactors are the nations sole 
source of tritium a key element in the production of nuclear 
weapons 
tritium a radioactive gas used to boost the explosive power of 
nuclear weapons decays about 55 percent annually and must be 
replenished periodically in warheads 
the kreactor was shut down in the summer of 1988 amid charges 
of unsafe practices 
in may energy secretary james watkins told a senate 
subcommittee that the kreactor would begin operations in late 
december or early january and that all three reactors would be up 
and running by the end of 1991 
but deputy energy secretary henson moore said last month the 
agency didnt know when the reactors would restart improved us 
relations with the soviet union had reduced the need to try to meet 
the december restart schedule moore said

armand hammers nearly 70 years of contact with 
the soviet union left an indelible mark on this country from 
memorabilia enshrined in vladimir lenins apartment to a modern 
capitalist trade center in moscow 
hammer 92 who died monday in los angeles received official 
adulation in the soviet union while bringing him some scorn in his 
native united states for dealing with the nations former cold war 
enemy 
president mikhail s gorbachev sent a message of condolence to 
the hammers family and said he was associated with one of the 
most remarkable pages in ussoviet relations 
foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh said the charismatic 
entrepreneur will be remembered for his tireless efforts to 
maintain good relations with the kremlin 
it is a big loss said dr matt shatz a producer at armand 
hammer productions a moscow filmmaking company hammer founded 12 
years ago 
he put all his strength into this company shatz said 
hammer made many trips to the soviet union the first in 1921 as 
a 23yearold doctor just out of columbia university medical 
school hammer the son of a russianborn father arrived as the 
soviet union suffered famine exacerbated by world war i 
he met lenin the soviet founder and was enlisted to help 
reestablish trade between the communist government and the west 
hammers first deal was us grain for soviet products 
hammer stayed in the country until 1930 becoming an executive 
of the amalgamated american co which the state news agency tass 
said was founded with lenins personal approval tass said 
during a later visit to the soviet union he said ill never 
forget what lenin told me during one of our meetings he said dr 
hammer we dont need doctors we need business people who can do 
things that was the end of my promising medical career 
hammer chairman of occidental petroleum corp became a 
representative of 38 foreign companies in the soviet union he 
owned and operated an asbestos mine and founded the first pencil 
factory in the ussr 
visitors to lenins meticulously preserved apartment in the 
kremlin can see four of the pencils standing in a holder on lenins 
desk 
guides also point proudly to a black leather chair where hammer 
sat during his meetings with the revolutionary leader and to a 
small stature of monkey sitting contemplatively on charles darwins 
book origin of the species hammer had given the sculpture to 
lenin as a gift 
hammer met with dictator josef stalin but the two could not 
work together and hammer ended up selling his enterprises to the 
soviet government after stalins death hammer resumed his efforts 
that melded business and politics 
he will live in history as well as in peoples memories as 
an entrepreneur who made cooperation by his country with the soviet 
union possible in the years when nobody dared to even think about 
it read an unsigned obituary in the government newspaper 
izvestia 
in 1978 thensoviet leader leonid brezhnev awarded hammer the 
order of friendship between peoples in honor of his 80th birthday 
and help in establishing better ussoviet relations 
at the same time hammer was wrapping up a deal to split the 
cost of a huge new international trade center in moscow the 
center built for the 1980 moscow olympic games houses the huge 
mezhdunarodnaya hotel and sovincenter exhibition complex it is 
known as the hammer center and is one of the citys most modern 
office complexes 
after the chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion in 1986 
hammer personally helped bring a bone marrow specialist dr robert 
gale to the soviet union along with costly medicine and equipment 
for operations 
throughout the 1970s and 1980s hammer cultivated his passion 
for art and presided over the opening of several exhibits and 
galleries he handed over historical relics including letters by 
lenin to the soviets

global wheat stockpiles continue at record 
high levels putting a damper on us exports and market prices an 
agriculture department report showed tuesday 
overall 199091 wheat production forecasts increased from a 
month ago with gains in canada china and mexico more than 
offsetting reduced prospects in brazil the european community and 
south africa 
the projected average us market price was reduced 5 cents a 
bushel from november to a range of 250 to 270 for the 
marketing year that began june 1 in the previous two years the 
farm price of wheat was 372 per bushel 
according to the new supplyanddemand report exports are still 
expected to be 1075 billion bushels in 199091 down from 1233 
billion last year 
the us wheat stockpile carried over next june 1 into the new 
harvest and marketing year was projected at 937 million bushels 
down slightly from the november outlook but still much larger than 
the 536 million bushels carried forward last june 1 
looking at corn and other coarse grains the report showed 
global production in 199091 and the yearending stockpile to be up 
slightly from last month 
although prolonged dry conditions have cut corn planting in 
south africa gains in the ec canada and turkey are more than 
offsetting the report said the smaller crop likely will 
eliminate corn exports by south africa during their 199091 
marketing year 
as with wheat farmers harvested a bumper corn crop this year 
however unlike wheat total corn use is expected to exceed output 
meaning some reduction in the stockpile during the 199091 
marketing year that began on sept 1 
consequently corn prices at the farm are projected to average 
220 to 250 per bushel this season compared with 236 in 
198990 
the corn stockpile next sept 1 was projected at 1236 billion 
bushels down from 1344 billion estimated this sept 1 
world oilseed production including us soybeans also is 
forecast at a record level in 199091 up 2 percent from last year 
the us soybean carryover next sept 1 was projected at 265 
million bushels up 10 million from the november forecast the 
soybean inventory this sept 1 was 239 million bushels 
farm prices of soybeans were projected to average 525 to 625 
per bushel in 199091 down 10 cents on both ends of the range from 
november last season soybeans averaged 570 per bushel 
nationally at the farm

more than 500 americans a majority of them 
children will remain in kuwait and iraq after this weeks 
evacuation flights although the number who are doing so 
voluntarily is unclear the state department said tuesday 
spokesman richard boucher said some families with one or more 
americans are staying because they have roots in iraq or kuwait in 
other cases the nonamerican head of household has been unable to 
obtain permission from iraqi authorities to leave 
just how many there are in each category could not be 
determined 
the evacuation of americans appeared all but over tuesday as 
only eight boarded a governmentchartered boeing 707 in baghdad a 
department official said when the same plane had left kuwait en 
route to baghdad there were no americans aboard 
with the exception of three americans who have had visa 
problems boucher said all americans who wish to leave iraq and 
kuwait apparently have left so far as is known 
on the chance that some americans appear who have not yet made 
their presence known to us officials an additional charter 
flight is planned for thursday white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said that flight is likely to be the last there are five 
us diplomats working at the embassy in kuwait and all will be 
brought home soon but it has not yet been decided whether they 
will be aboard the thursday flight 
the three other americans who have been left behind had been 
among those used by iraqi authorities as human shields to deter a 
potential us military strike boucher said 
he said that as many as 510 americans will remain in kuwait and 
iraq permanently that is more than half the number who were in the 
two countries when president saddam hussein announced last week 
that all foreign hostages were free to go home 
as of today we believe that as many as 310 americans have 
chosen to stay in kuwait boucher said this includes 60 women 
215 children and 35 males with dual kuwaitiamerican citizenship 
as many as 200 more americans have chosen to stay in iraq of these 
40 are women 79 are children and 80 are men with dual 
iraqiamerican citizenship 
obviously the decision to leave is a deeply personal one but 
we have made every effort to offer our best advice as well as the 
means to depart he said 
the embassy has made an effort to ensure that there was not 
the slightest possibility that any american was unwillingly left 
behind boucher said 
he said us officials have received information about 30 
persons said to be americans living in kuwait but have had no luck 
in locating them 
it is not known whether these individuals are still in kuwait 
whether they have ever been in kuwait whether they are american 
citizens or even whether many of them exist boucher said

factional rivalries erupted in 
warfare tuesday in tokoza where zulus and xhosas slashed and shot 
37 people to death and burned scores of homes before black 
officials held peace talks 
in the afternoon when the violence had died down women piled 
household belongings on their heads and fled in the rain to seek 
shelter in a nearby township 
armed men stayed behind guarding their shacks in the 
impoverished township and the workers hostels that have become a 
flashpoint of factional unrest 
representatives of the african national congress and the inkatha 
freedom party whose supporters are at the center of the clashes 
met later and said they would appeal to their followers to stop 
fighting 
past appeals from leaders of the rival groups have made little 
difference the death toll in johannesburg townships has exceeded 
1000 since august and anc leader nelson mandela and inkatha 
leader mangosuthu buthelezi have yet to sit down to talk 
buthelezi citing a tight schedule and late notice rejected an 
invitation to tour tokoza on wednesday with mandela and other black 
leaders he said he instead would visit tokoza separately with 
national law and order minister adriaan vlok and said mandela 
declined an invitation to join them 
xhosas loyal to the anc and zulus who back inkatha battled for 
hours with guns knives and axes and chased terrified people 
through the alleys of the phola park squatter camp within tokoza 
east of johannesburg 
hacked and mutilated bodies lay outside shacks that were reduced 
to smoldering piles 
fighting also raged in a nearby workers hostel where zulus 
live and in a surrounding industrial area 
we want revenge we want to fight some zulus chanted as 
they congregated at the hostel later 
both sides blamed each other for the violence and accused 
government security forces of helping their opponents police in 
armored vehicles roamed the township but rarely ventured into the 
narrow lanes of shacks making up phola park 
helicopters hovered above and the government said police and 
army reinforcements would be deployed in tokoza 
in the late afternoon zulus wearing white headbands and 
carrying iron bars stared out from the broken windows of their 
hostel or stood guard outside one woman carried a large saw 
others held rocks in addition to their bars 
down the road in the squatter camp a few xhosas were on guard 
outside their shacks draped in blankets in the heavy rain 
police spokesman capt eugene opperman said reports indicated 
fighting flared before dawn when xhosas attacked the zulu hostel 
and the zulus mounted a revenge attack 
he denied police took sides in the fighting he said officers 
were fired on several times but were not injured 
hostels have been a frequent target of township unrest because 
they generally house zulus who come from the zulu homeland to take 
jobs at mines or in other industry 
at least 53 people have died in factional battles in tokoza 
since the latest fighting began over the weekend 
inkatha and the anc are south africas largest black political 
movements while both oppose apartheid they disagree strongly on 
how best to fight it and on their vision of a future south africa 
inkatha favors a conservative policy including free enterprise 
while the anc leans more to leftist economic policies inkatha has 
opposed sanctions which the anc supports and inkatha condemned 
the ancs armed struggle against the whiteled government 
anc national executive committee member penuell maduna and 
inkatha youth league chairman themba khoza represented their groups 
at the peace meeting tuesday they said in a joint statement that 
they would try to persuade their members to be more tolerant of 
other political groups 
buthelezi the inkatha leader released a statement later 
deploring the violence but also alleging there was a deliberate 
effort to keep him from taking part in the highprofile township 
tour wednesday with mandela and other black leaders 
buthelezi said he received his invitation from the south african 
council of churches only monday 
i am very troubled that i am given this kind of overnight 
warning of very important matters he said

columbia the oldest space 
shuttle came back from its 10th mission in good condition but with 
no quick answers to its lint and plumbing woes a nasa official 
said tuesday 
columbia dropped out of orbit a day early to beat rainy weather 
forecast for the mojave desert landing site and touched down at 
954 pm monday ending its astronomy mission after nine days on 
tuesday there was no sign of the rain 
the origin of lint that fouled cooling systems for two computers 
needed investigation but it likely was inside the devices before 
launch and not from the shuttle interior said columbia flow 
director bascom murrah 
the orbiter cooling system looked clean he said these 
panels were given to us by the payload community so if there was 
debris in there we think that that probably came with the 
panel when it was given to us to install in the orbiter 
shuttle cleaning procedures were reviewed and everything was 
up to snuff murrah said 
the lint was suspected to have caused failure of two computer 
terminals for controlling the 150 million astro observatory a 
group of ultraviolet and xray telescopes in columbias payload 
bay 
much of the aiming of the telescopes had to be done by the 
crews astronaut astronomers using a joystick and keyboard only 
135 of 250 planned targets were observed although that still 
amounted to a wealth of data about stars galaxies quasars 
supernovas and a comet 
ultraviolet and xray radiation from such objects is blocked by 
the earths atmosphere 
no brake problems were observed when columbia landed and the 
thermal tiles that protect it from the heat of reentry into the 
atmosphere were in good to excellent condition murrah said damage 
to tiles from impacts with debris either during launch reentry or 
landing was minimal he said 
television pictures of columbia on the runway showed blotches on 
its underside but murrah said the shuttle was just showing its 
age 
columbia is an old bird and weve got a lot of pockmarks on it 
that weve repaired but a lot of that you were seeing was old 
repairs and not damage from this flight he said 
there was no immediate answer to the question of why the 
shuttles system for collecting and dumping liquid waste into space 
had clogged 
the clog caused a collection tank to fill up and threatened to 
force an early end to the mission the astronauts however became 
plumbers and were able to drain the tank into urine collection 
bags 
the system will be examined after the shuttle is flown back to 
kennedy space center in florida 
we had had a problem previously with clogging in that system 
and we changed out a line and a dump valve and evidently theres 
more debris upstream of those components but that orifice is very 
very small and it doesnt take much to clog it murrah said 
the opening is tiny to compress the stream into a spray so it 
will fan out and not freeze solid on the outside of the craft 
one of the science instruments in the cargo hold the 
ultraviolet imaging telescope stored its pictures on film the 
film will be removed friday and sent to goddard space flight center 
in greenbelt md for processing the pictures will be ready later 
this month or in january 
murrah said columbia should be mounted aboard nasas boeing 747 
ferry plane in time to begin its return trip sunday the flight to 
florida will take two days

pfizer inc will conduct an unprecedented 
search to warn about 23000 patients about rare but often fatal 
fractures of an implanted heart valve officials said tuesday 
the food and drug administration said it had accepted pfizers 
plan to locate patients who have the bjorkshiley 60degree 
convexoconcave heart valve 
valve fractures have occurred in about seven of every 10000 
patients per year the fda said 
the valve was implanted in about 82000 people worldwide between 
1979 and november 1986 when it was removed from the market about 
23000 of the patients who are still alive are in the united states 
and canada 
about 295 fractures of the valve were reported to the fda with 
178 deaths resulting 
when a valve fractures a patients life can be saved if the 
valve is replaced quickly 
thats why it is important for cc valve patients to ask their 
doctors how to recognize early signs of valve fracture and what to 
do should it occur fda deputy commissioner james benson said 
public citizen health research group a ralph naderfounded 
advocacy group has been pressing the fda and pfizer for years to 
notify patients about the danger 
the fdas procedure has been for companies recalling medical 
devices to contact physicians who then would speak to their 
patients but that policy is being reviewed said fda spokeswoman 
susan cruzan 
also the agency is developing a plan to work with foreign 
governments to notify patients overseas she said about 59000 
patients with the valve live outside north america 
the company last week sent letters to about 19000 heart 
specialists telling them of the program and asking them to contact 
patients who have the shiley valve about 450 hospitals are also 
being contacted 
on thursday the company will announce plans for a patient 
registry that will include a tollfree telephone number for 
patients to identify themselves 
the program will be run by medic alert a nonprofit foundation 
which will send letters to patients through their doctors or 
directly if their doctor cant be located said pfizer spokesman 
rick honey 
those patients will be sent information about their valve 
implant as well as an identification card and a bracelet or neck 
chain identifying them as having a cc heart valve 
medic alert has set up a telephone number where patients can get 
further information the number is 18002451492

a man who makes execution devices used 
around the country appeared in court trial tuesday on charges of 
practicing engineering without a license 
outside the courtroom fred leuchter jr was also on trial for 
his views that the systematic extermination of jews by gas chamber 
during world war ii did not occur 
you liar you liar i watched my family go to the gas 
chamber yelled anton segure a 63yearold holocaust survivor 
who came from albany ny to protest leuchters view i was 
there fortyfive years ago my whole family was gassed 
leuchters case on charges he is not a licensed engineer was 
continued until jan 22 with no argument 
he complained that the charges which include a maximum three 
months in jail and 500 fine have thwarted his lucrative business 
as an expert witness about execution technology in capital 
punishment trials and consultant on execution machines leuchter 
acknowledges he is not a statecertified engineer but asserts it 
is not required for his consulting work 
he has designed and built capital punishment equipment 
primarily electric chairs for prisons in a number states of where 
the death penalty is legal 
the state filed the charges against leuchter at the urging of 
several of the groups protesting his beliefs 
and jewish activists seized the occasion of the hearing to 
protest leuchters revisionist theories and they flew in nazi 
hunter beate klarsfeld from paris to join them in this suburb north 
of boston 
he is a very dangerous man he denies the death of 6 million 
people said klarsfeld who helped convict former gestapo chief 
klaus barbie we are determined not to let him go on with this 
denial 
leuchter refused to acknowledge protesters who also crashed a 
news conference he held a few hours after the pretrial hearing 
tuesday but when asked several times what he thought of eyewitness 
accounts of the mass murders of jews in concentration camps in the 
1940s he said there are no eyewitnesses there are none 
leuchter asserts in published reports and interviews that gas 
chambers at at least three death camps were not technically 
equipped to kill thousands of prisoners 
meyer hack rolled up his coat sleeve to reveal the 73684 
tattooed on his arm in the camp at birkenau and said he wished 
leuchter had been with him in 1942 and 1943 when he escaped the 
chamber by faking his own death 
i talk with my heart the 73yearold hack said trembling 
and clutching the woman next to him the brute will never know 
but leuchter who boasts he is the only true expert on execution 
technology in the united states said the issue is free speech 
because certain groups and individuals did not like my report 
these groups or individuals have formed an international cabal to 
destroy the report he said 
a texas lawyer who has addressed the aryan nations congress has 
volunteered to take leuchters case for free the attorney kirk 
lyons said they are considering a civil defamation suit 
leuchter claims he is a scientist who has disproved the 
existence of an event long accepted as part of history 
im sure columbus galileo and copernicus caused emotional 
harm to those who promoted the flatearth theory but that did not 
stop the earth from being a sphere he said 
leonard zakim executive director of the new england 
antidefamation league of bnai brith said it would be giving 
leuchter too much credit to engage in an intellectual debate over 
the authenticity of the holocaust 
its as ridiculous as saying world war ii never happened 
zakim said wouldnt it be great if what he said was true

contradicting a regulators testimony sen 
alan cranstons banking aide denied on tuesday that she pressured 
us officials to weaken their hardnosed enforcement of charles h 
keating jrs savings and loan 
carolyn d jordan told the senate ethics committee that if she 
had tried to pressure regulators to go easy on keatings thrift 
they would have clearly understood i did not say that 
a senior career regulator testified last week that pressure from 
ms jordan caused thrift officials to weaken their enforcement of 
keatings lincoln savings and loan the official william k black 
said her action was a factor in delaying government seizure of the 
irvine calif sampl and inflating the taxpayer bailout cost 
ms jordan repeatedly testified she could not recall specifics 
of meetings she attended with keating or his executives 
at one point an annoyed committee vice chairman warren rudman 
rnh remarked the witness has very good recall of some things 
and very poor recall about some others 
ms jordan counsel to the senate banking committee said she 
called two officials of the federal home loan bank board after the 
regulators proposed close supervision of keatings savings and loan 
on may 5 1988 
she testified that cranston dcalif one of five senators 
under investigation by the ethics committee did not ask her to 
make the call ms jordan said the impetus came from keating 
executive james grogan who called her immediately after the bank 
board met to complain about its action 
ms jordan said she found it unusual that the board would take 
tough enforcement action when lincoln officials were disputing 
regulators findings that the thrift was failing lincoln was 
seized april 14 1989 and the cost to taxpayers is expected to 
exceed 2 billion 
last week black told the committee that pressure by ms jordan 
caused the board to modify its enforcement program several weeks 
later and that the changes permitted lincoln to continue making 
risky direct investments and to expand its junk bond business 
also the regulator contended ms jordans call helped delay 
government seizure 
the hearing adjourned for the day after ms jordan completed her 
testimony an executive session is scheduled for wednesday so the 
committee can privately question grogan 
the committee now in its 16th day of hearings is investigating 
the relationship of cranston and four other senators to keating 
john mccain rariz dennis deconcini dariz john glenn 
dohio and donald w riegle jr dmich 
keating and associates raised 13 million for the campaigns and 
causes of the five all of whom intervened with regulators on 
behalf of lincoln the committee is trying to decide whether their 
assistance was related to the contributions 
a number of committee documents show that in contacts with 
keating or his executives cranston and his chief fundraiser joy 
jacobson often linked the subjects of contributions and lincolns 
battle with the bank board 
cranston received 850000 from keating for three voter 
registration projects the senator strongly supported 
former bank board chairman m danny wall has testified that 
cranston made an unusual number of calls to him on behalf of 
lincoln but wall said he did not believe the calls were improper 
ms jordan was questioned about a memo she wrote to cranston on 
may 6 1988 in which she discussed grogans account of the bank 
boards tough enforcement stance the previous day 
she said the board wanted a supervisory agreement that would 
trigger public reports on lincolns condition 
it can affect the value of lincoln stock and will depress 
prices and affect liquidity ms jordan wrote in the memo to the 
senator 
she then wrote cranston i told them you were very concerned 
that the board would choose the supervisory approach after all that 
had come out about the behavior of ed grays people at the fhlbb of 
san francisco and additionally when lincoln had over 6 percent net 
worth and was not losing any money 
edwin j gray is the former chairman of the bank board both 
cranston and keating argued with him over regulators tough 
supervision of lincoln 
ms jordan also testified that she not cranston was 
responsible for the insertion in the congressional record in 1987 
of a cranston statement that was helpful to keating 
she said cranston never approved the statement an assertion 
that produced skepticism from sen jesse helms rnc a committee 
member 
helms said now what is the story did he approve that going 
in the record 
jordan responded no he did not 
helms so just staff members put it in without his 
knowledge 
jordan that is correct 
cranstons statement in the record said he opposed expanding 
authority of the bank board to limit risky investments and was 
glad sponsors withdrew such a proposal from pending legislation 
the statement was cited by keating in his lawsuit challenging a 
rule already approved by the board which limited risky 
investments 
a week after the statement was placed in the record cranston 
deconcini mccain and glenn attended a crucial meeting with gray 
gray testified that at the meeting deconcini cited keatings 
legal challenge and asked that the risky investment rule be waived 
for lincoln until the court case was resolved 
deconcini has denied such negotiation took place

the soviet union has received 1272 metric tons of 
food aid from abroad since the start of a campaign to stave off 
shortages that president mikhail s gorbachev has said threaten his 
reforms 
we welcome the hand offered to us and will not push it away 
presidential spokesman vitaly ignatenko said at a briefing tuesday 
according to the state news agency tass 
more shipments were expected wednesday and they would be 
distributed to byelorussia the ukraine and parts of russia 
ignatenko said 
the shortages have grown more acute in recent months 
exacerbated by distribution problems black market pilfering and 
panic buying officials have said an associated press survey of 
major cities across the country indicated shortages were worst in 
urban areas 
the baltic republic of estonia however apparently was having 
few problems estonian prime minister edgar savisaar told soviet 
officials tuesday by telegram that his republic does not need food 
aid from the west the independent interfax news agency reported 
but it would accept medicine for children and the elderly he 
said 
estonia like the other baltic republics latvia and lithuania 
traditionally have been welloff compared to other republics 
because of their own food resources and proximity to sympathetic 
scandinavian countries

president bush and israeli prime minister 
yitzhak shamir put a positive face tuesday on relations strained by 
new us ties to israels arab foes bush promised to keep israels 
qualitative edge in weaponry an american official said 
the two leaders in a friendly and good exchange of views on 
the persian gulf crisis and other subjects also discussed 
prospects for increased us aid to ease israels immigration 
burden said assistant secretary of state john kelly 
but bush voiced us concerns about treatment of palestinians 
living in the israeli occupied territory kelly said though the 
president did not bring up the touchy matter of the slaying of 17 
palestinians by israeli police during an october riot at a 
jerusalem holy site 
nor did bush press shamir to cooperate with a planned united 
nations investigation of that incident because their discussion 
evolved that way without that subject coming up kelly said 
shamir told reporters he felt assured by bush that the united 
states would not accept a deal with iraq that would threaten 
israel especially in light of israels increasing edginess over 
new us alliances in the region 
i trust the president what he said he has said it several 
times and he said it to me now again that there will not be any 
deal at the expense of israel shamir said after spending nearly 
two hours with bush and his aides 
having promised the united states it will lie low in the persian 
gulf crisis israeli leaders have indicated fear that the 
administration would accept a diplomatic solution that would leave 
intact iraqs stores of chemical and biological weapons 
israel also is worried about bushs plans to sell saudi arabia 
some 20 billion in sophisticated arms and has asked for an 
increase in us military aid to offset the unprecedented sale 
the prime minister was assured by the president that we will 
maintain a qualitative edge in armaments for israel but at the 
same time we want to help out with the legitimate selfdefense 
needs of our arab friends in the region kelly told reporters 
after the meeting 
on immigration shamir told bush that israel would be looking 
for additional help to cope with influx of jewish immigrants from 
the soviet union and ethiopia 
shamir did not ask for a specific amount and bush was generally 
supportive kelly said but he said the administration was waiting 
to see the impact of its current loan program under which the 
united states has guaranteed 400 million in loans for new 
immigrant housing on condition that the homes not be built in the 
occupied territories 
after the meeting both shamir and kelly stressed the nations 
common opposition to iraqi aggression in the gulf area 
we have been delighted to express our full support for the 
leadership of the president for the policy of the united states in 
this recent crisis of the gulf shamir said 
and the president also expresses his support for our behavior 
for our policy in the crisis shamir added 
israeli officials had said shamir would assure bush israel would 
not launch any preemptive strikes against iraq 
but when asked about that kelly said shamir didnt talk about 
potential israeli actions he said bush thanked him for keeping 
a low profile in the crisis 
israel got praised several times for its position said 
shamirs adviser avi pazner there is no willingness on our part 
to change that position he told reporters 
as delicate diplomatic aspects of the gulf crisis proceed 
senior israeli officials have suggested that israel might go after 
iraqs military machine if the united states does not 
there was a strong expression of identity of views on seeing 
iraqi aggression rebuffed kelly told reporters 
shamir said that he and bush reached a general understanding 
more or less on all the moves in the gulf and on israels 
position 
a meeting between shamir and soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze was being arranged for wednesday in washington 
israeli sources said 
shevardnadze was traveling to washington to meet with bush 
following two days of talks with secretary of state james a baker 
iii in houston israels cool relationship with the soviet union 
has begun to thaw somewhat under the policies of soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev 
kelly said that it was understood by the administration that the 
peace process involving israel and the palestinians was more or 
less on hold until the gulf crisis is resolved 
israel is worried that some arab nations backing bush in the 
gulf crisis will demand us pressure on israel to relinquish the 
occupied lands 
the administration while rejecting attempts by iraq and its 
allies to link the two issues in a un security council 
resolution hopes to revive stalled mideast peace moves 
previous us efforts focused on getting israelis to sit down 
with palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza strip but the 
palestinians fervent support for iraq in the gulf crisis has made 
that even less likely

a uschartered iraqi airways 
jetliner ferrying seven americans and other former hostages to 
freedom arrived in frankfurt late tuesday from baghdad 
on board the boeing 707 along with the americans were two 
canadians two britons an irishman an italian and an australian 
said craig springer us consulate spokesman in frankfurt 
before departure diplomats said six britons were on board and 
did not mention an australian or italian there was no immediate 
explanation for the discrepancy 
us officials had originally planned to charter a boeing 747 
jumbo jet to frankfurt and it was to have two state department 
doctors aboard to deal with people coming out of hiding in kuwait 
who have experienced a lot of stress 
just one of the doctors was on the flight said springer 
springer said the former hostages would stay in a hotel outside 
frankfurt overnight and fly to their final destinations the 
following day on regular commercial flights 
the boeing 707 was one of three chartered jetliners delivering 
former hostages out of iraq on tuesday 
two others left for bangkok and london 
diplomats said 14 americans were on the charter flights from 
baghdad 
seven were among the 310 people most of them britons on the 
flight that left for london 
seven more were on the flight to frankfurt 
a japanesechartered iraqi airways 707 left baghdad for bangkok 
with 159 people aboard including 14 japanese diplomats from kuwait 
and the rest mostly former japanese hostages 
the white house said tuesday that a scheduled thursday 
evacuation flight of americans is likely to be the last and 
will probably also carry home the remaining staff of the us 
embassy in kuwait 
iraqi president saddam hussein last week announced the blanket 
release of all westerners and the first specially chartered 
freedom flights began sunday 
earlier tuesday diplomats said about 600 us citizens remain 
in iraq and kuwait they also said about 400 were expected to 
remain in iraq mostly people with dual usiraqi citizenship or 
american spouses of iraqi citizens

the army said tuesday it will press for tougher 
sentences for convicted arab stonethrowers who have received jail 
terms ranging from six months to 10 years in the past 
officials said the move was part of a new campaign to quell the 
3yearold palestinian uprising 
on monday the army began posting snipers at key intersections 
in the occupied lands with orders to shoot arabs pelting israeli 
vehicles at least four palestinians have been wounded in ambushes 
in the occupied west bank the army said 
in bethlehem meanwhile troops began erecting barbed wire 
barriers across some roads leading into the city on tuesday but 
the area around the site believed to be christs birthplace 
remained open to visitors 
on sunday a soldier was killed and two others wounded by a 
roadside bomb blast the towns 40000 palestinian residents 
remained under a curfew 
a few tourists visited the church of the nativity and christs 
birthplace normally bethlehem is crowded with christian pilgrims 
during the christmas season 
army prosecutors will ask for harsher sentences for stone 
throwers in the military courts in the west bank and gaza strip an 
army official said but he would not specify what sentences would 
be requested 
the policy is to deal with rock throwing in a much firmer 
way said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
israel army radio suggested the army hoped to halt rock throwing 
at jewish settlers who have complained of an increase in stonings 
in the past year 
the maximum sentence for stonethrowing is 20 years the same as 
for manslaughter but it has never been imposed 
until now sentences have ranged from about six months for first 
offenders who didnt cause damage to a year for those who caused 
some damage sentences of 10 years have been made for those who 
injured someone 
palestinian lawyer jonathan kuttab who has defended hundreds of 
clients against stonethrowing charges said military court judges 
usually follow the requests of prosecutors 
kuttab claimed there are different standards of justice between 
the military and civilian courts where jewish settlers are tried 
he cited the case of settler leader moshe levinger who served 
three months in prison after shooting to death a palestinian shoe 
salesman levinger was convicted of firing into stores after 
soldiers ignored his complaint that his car was stoned 
because israel makes the claim that it does have all the 
trappings of justice it must be noted that this is not the case 
kuttab said the military courts are part of the mechanism of 
control and punishment 
the army official rejected kuttabs charges of unfair treatment 
of palestinians but acknowledged that sentences in military trials 
were imposed for deterrence as well as punishment 
army officials have said stone throwing made up about 90 percent 
of the violent incidents during the uprising they estimate 100000 
cases of stone throwing since december 1987 
during the uprising israeli soldiers and civilians have killed 
777 palestinians while 54 israelis have been slain by 
palestinians at least 316 palestinians have been killed by fellow 
arabs most as suspected collaborators

allow all foreigners to leave he had barred many foreigners from 
departing and some were detained at strategic sites to ward off a 
possible attack 
an undisclosed number of americans chose to stay 
we will continue to provide all services we possibly can to 
all americans left in iraq and kuwait a senior us diplomat 
said speaking on condition of anonymity 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
final evacuation flight for americans now scheduled for thursday 
is likely to be the last and it is also likely to be the one to 
evacuate us embassy personnel from kuwait

evacuate as have british diplomats 
but on tuesday british foreign secretary douglas hurd indicated 
the two remaining british diplomats might soon leave the occupied 
emirate 
he said in london that once all british hostages have left we 
will work out with these two brave men how long they should stay

many of the 150000 soviet jewish emigres used 
the beginning of hanukkah on tuesday to celebrate their new lives 
while learning the centuriesold traditions of their faith 
while the soviet jews knew of the eightday festival of lights 
many of the immigrants are secular jews and know little of jewish 
history 
either they are totally confused or talk nonsense because they 
have been cut off from judaism for generations said alexander 
ilyin 27 an immigrant who gives religious instructions to 
newcomers 
other soviets who immigrated earlier as well as government 
ministries and organizations have arranged special seminars and 
trips to help new immigrants understand the meaning of hanukkah 
i never knew what hanukkah or even judaism was in the soviet 
union said binyamin kletzel 58 an artist who arrived five days 
ago from kuibyshev on the volga river the only thing being a jew 
meant to me was that we got beat up 
hanna yeruslusky who immigrated from kuibyshev three years ago 
helped kletzel look for an apartment before the holiday began at 
sundown 
she said she hoped the joy of hanukkah would make the immigrants 
forget their troubles adjusting to a new country the many 
immigrants have strained israels housing and job markets as well 
as the government budget 
more than 1000 jews have been arriving in israel daily as a 
result of the soviet union easing its emigration policies 
hanukkah marks the victory of the jews over the grecosyrian 
kingdom in 165 bc the kingdom had tried to impose its culture on 
the jews and desecrated the holy temple in jerusalem with statues 
of greek gods 
jews rose in revolt and drove the syrians out of the country 
according to legend when the jews entered jerusalem and tried 
to rekindle the temples eternal flame they found only enough oil 
for one day but the oil miraculously lasted eight days 
to commemorate the miracle jews light candles at sunset for 
eight consecutive days the candles are placed in a candelabra 
called a menorah 
the festival is celebrated by religious and secular jews as a 
holiday that not only marks the ancient jewish victory but also 
reminds israelis of their desire to perpetuate national jewish 
identity

the twisted burnedout wreckage from the 75vehicle pileup rescue 
workers stepped over spilled cargo from trucks as well as scattered 
luggage and clothing thrown from cars 
and the survivors marveled at their own good fortune amid the 
carnage that surrounded them 
mary youness 55 of cleveland and her family were next to a 
propane tanker truck when the accident began they heard crashes 
all around in the fog she said but their car managed to slide 
onto the shoulder unscathed 
we feel terribly lucky this truck was on the other side of 
us and a car was smashed between this truck and another truck 
mrs youness said 
and the truck driver said that if the car had not been between 
them a girl was killed in the car that was between if the other 
truck had hit him this explosion of propane would have wiped 
everything out she said 
officials feared the death toll the worst since the state began 
keeping records 20 years ago still could mount as rescue workers 
searched the remains of some of the vehicles 
but there were also tales of heroism 
bill johnson 45 was headed south on interstate 75 about 930 
am when his citizens band radio started crackling that there was 
trouble ahead on the fogshrouded highway 
everybody was hollering on the cbs set it down johnson 
said i stopped because i could see the tail lights of the truck 
ahead but when i stopped another one hit me in the back 
johnson said he got out of his pickup and rushed to check on the 
two people in the vehicle behind him a fourwheel drive truck the 
driver was shaken up he said 
i said are you all right and he said buddy i dont 
know i said will you please just get out of your truck he 
said i dont know i said please get out of your truck 
johnson said 
both people got out and johnson and the driver walked around 
back of the fourwheel drive vehicle seconds later a rental truck 
rushed out of the fog and crashed into the rear of the second 
vehicle turning it into an unrecognizable heap of metal 
thats how quick it hit johnson said shaking his head 
we got right by that before he hit this is the worst thing

the publisher of the new york daily news on 
tuesday claimed progress in regaining circulation lost in a nearly 
7weekold strike and said the tabloid isnt ready to cut losses 
and sell 
publisher james hoge met with the board of directors of the 
tribune co which owns the daily news to discuss the strike as 
about 100 prounion pickets marched outside the landmark tribune 
tower 
the strike is costly but not as expensive as trying to run the 
paper with all the excess costs and contract abuses that we had 
in the old contract hoge told a news conference 
a spokesman for nine striking unions said the daily news cant 
hope to survive without a settlement or sale of the newspaper 
our rule is that we are plowing ahead as long as we can show 
that we are making significant progress hoge said of putting out 
the newspaper under strike conditions it is the opinion of 
everyone involved in this process that we are making significant 
progress and we are going forward 
the newspaper has published every day since the strike began 
oct 25 but circulation dropped from 109 million hoge said net 
paid circulation was up this week to 580000 copies from 552000 a 
week ago 
hoge attributed the increase to a network of news dealers and 
hawkers that now total nearly half the prestrike number of 12000 
outlets 
hoge said he was confident that advertisers who bailed out of 
the daily news would return to the newspaper as circulation 
increases 
the striking unions representing 2100 workers claim unfair 
labor practices the daily news has hired replacement workers to 
put out the newspaper 
on wednesday negotiations switch for the first time to 
washington before the federal mediation and conciliation service 
the two sides were to meet separately with a mediator 
theodore kheel a legal adviser to the striking unions and their 
frequent spokesman called the decision to keep publishing a form 
of sheer masochism 
the news has no hope of survival whatsoever in the absence of 
a settlement or sale kheel said the sooner the board realizes 
that the better everyone including the tribune co will be 
george mcdonald president of the allied printing trades 
council the umbrella of striking unions said tribune co 
president charles brumback was hellbent on a course of financial 
bankruptcy 
mcdonald urged tribune co stockholders to call for brumbacks 
immediate resignation 
about 100 people most of them from chicago union locals 
picketed the tribune tower led by several striking daily news 
workers the demonstration was peaceful 
gov mario cuomo the rev jesse jackson and cardinal john 
oconnor addressed an estimated 6500 people at a prounion rally 
monday in front of the daily news offices

in a season of selfconsciously serious films mermaids is a 
refreshing breather a bittersweet reminiscence of one familys 
chaotic comingofage in the 1960s 
the holiday treat in mermaids is the addition of another 
memorable portrait by cher in the gallery of women shes portrayed 
on screen the entertainer who once had trouble being accepted as 
a serious actress has matured into a powerful movie presence with 
a gift for showing the soft center of tough women without getting 
gooey about it 
in mermaids cher is mrs flax a woman on the run from her 
own personal demons who takes her two young daughters along for the 
ride she wears tight dresses tends to bed the wrong men and when 
it all falls apart as it does every few months she packs up her 
girls and hits the road choosing a new town by poking her finger 
at a map 
for teenage daughter charlotte who narrates this story these 
moves are a recurring nightmare although not catholic she 
retreats into fantasies about being a nun charlotte portrayed by 
the ubiquitous winona ryder who seems to be in every movie 
requiring a teenager this season fashions a shrine in her room 
and sees all events as signs from god 
her young halfsister kate christina ricci is obsessed with 
competitive swimming and seems unfazed by the upheavals as long as 
theres a swimming pool in their new town 
we meet the fatherless flax family as mother is breaking up with 
another beau and moving on this time they settle in a picturesque 
new england village where the local shoe salesman bob hoskins 
takes a fancy to mrs flax charlotte meanwhile becomes smitten 
with the young handsome caretaker at the nearby convent 
challenging her vow to become a nun 
relationships develop and careen toward an unexpected crisis 
which seems too clearly a filmmakers technique for bringing the 
movie to a conclusion suspension of disbelief is essential here 
director richard benjamin deftly uses the splendid new england 
scenery and the 60s backdrop to draw mrs flaxs world the songs 
of the era are sprinkled throughout and a segment recalling the 
john f kennedy assassination is poignantly evocative of a calamity 
seen through the eyes of a teenager 
it seemed there were no adults alive anymore charlotte 
muses as she walks the empty leafstrewn streets in that autumn of 
1963 
winona ryders earnestness is appealing and hoskins exuding 
warmth and normalcy is the perfect foil for chers brassy mrs 
flax 
some will be reminded of chers tough but caring mother in 
mask but mrs flax is her own woman cher knows her well and 
insists that we like her how can we resist 
mermaids is rated pg13 with a nonexplicit sex scene and

the people who deserve the greatest admiration are the 
kuwaitis who sheltered us despite the fact that they could be 
executed on the spot if they were found helping us ken emsden 
61 a freed british hostage 
 
we have reached general understanding more or less on all 
the moves in the gulf and on israels position israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir after meeting with president bush 
 
as of today we believe that as many as 310 americans have 
chosen to stay in kuwait as many as 200 more americans have 
chosen to stay in iraq obviously the decision to leave is a 
deeply personal one but we have made every effort to offer our 
best advice as well as the means to depart state department 
spokesman richard boucher 
 
i listened to president bush and senators and congressmen 
stand up on television and say america will not tolerate the 
holding of its citizens and my brother has been chained to a wall

a 16yearold on tuesday became the first 
defendant convicted of attempted murder in the gang rape of the 
central park jogger a second youth was acquitted of the same 
charge and convicted of lesser charges 
spectators erupted in anger and shock when the verdicts were 
returned against kevin richardson and kharey wise after 12 days of 
jury deliberation 
richardsons mother grace cuffey fainted and the courtroom was 
cleared while she was treated with oxygen at her seat 
youre going to pay for this jesus is going to get you you 
made this up wise told prosecutor elizabeth lederer as he 
was led from the courtroom in handcuffs 
richardson 16 was convicted of attempted murder rape sodomy 
robbery assault and riot wise 18 loudly cursed lederer after he 
was acquitted of 10 of 13 counts against him including attempted 
murder rape and sodomy he was convicted of firstdegree assault 
sexual abuse and riot 
three other teenagers were convicted in august of rape and 
assault in the case 
richardson and wise were jailed without bail pending a jan 9 
sentencing 
richardson charged as a minor faces a maximum prison term of 
five to 10 years wise charged as an adult could receive nearly 
nine to 26 years in prison if the judge orders him to serve the 
terms concurrently 
wise admitted in a videotapd statement that the april 19 1989 
attack on a woman investment broker was my first rape and it 
will be my last 
wises lawyer colin moore argued that police coerced the 
statement from his client manhattan district attorney robert 
morgenthau said he was pleased the jury had rejected that 
allegation 
a jury has rejected spurious claims that the police 
manufactured evidence and used coercive tactics to obtain 
confessions morgenthau said 
the woman was not widely identified because she was a sexual 
assault victim her case generated enormous public interest and 
debate 
critics of the national media attention attributed it to her 
status as a white investment banker in a city where minority crime 
victims get less attention others cited her dramatic fight for 
life her recovery and return to work and her quiet bravery 
the verdicts came in the second trial stemming from the attack 
on the woman now 30 along a jogging path in central park she 
still suffers vision balance and olfactory problems 
wise and richardson wept and hugged each other when the verdicts 
were read 
i am obviously shattered very very disappointed said 
richardsons attorney howard diller im really dismayed the 
jury found him guilty on every single count its shocking 
moore said a fair and just verdict would have been an 
acquittal on all counts 
both attorneys said they would appeal 
supporters of the defendants yelled at the judge and the 
prosecutors 
the woman found about four hours after the attack lost 
threefourths of her blood her skull was broken her left 
cheekbone was crushed and she had bruises all over her body 
antron mccray yusef salaam and raymond santana all 16 were 
cnnvicted aug 18 of rape assault and other charges in the case 
all were sentenced in september to five to 10 years in prison 
steven lopez 16 will be the last to face charges during a 
trial scheduled for early next year 
the second trial began much as the first had with lederer 
saying the defendants own words would convict them defense 
lawyers charged videotaped statements were coerced by racist police 
looking for black and hispanic suspects 
the statements were the prosecutions chief evidence 
wise described how the victim screamed kicked and struggled 
violently until she was struck unconscious with a rock 
lederer asked wise whether he thought they had left the woman 
dead 
thats the way i looked at it he said 
wise later said police hit and tricked him into fabricating the

federal authorities unsealed a 42count 
indictment tuesday charging six men with operating a 21 million 
investment and insurance scam that left more than 1300 families 
with no health insurance coverage 
the grand jury indictment resulted from a twoyear investigation 
by the fbi the internal revenue service and inspectors from the 
us postal service and the department of labor 
what is especially frightening is that we all can be 
victimized by this type of criminal enterprise because each of us 
has a very fundamental need for a health insurance policy that will 
assure us and our families that we can afford the health care we 
may need said julian de la rosa inspector general with the 
labor department 
he spoke at a news conference at the federal courthouse in 
charlotte 
there are more than 1350 victims that have been identified in 
this one investigation de la rosa said but the tragedy is not 
confined to these 1350 unfortunate people 
the indictment describes allegations of fraud by the nowdefunct 
cap staffing of charlotte a firm which leased employees to more 
than 120 firms the company was to use fees paid by the firms to 
provide health insurance and other benefits to the workers 
but the indictment said the companys managers used the funds 
for themselves 
the companies that used cap staffing are in north carolina 
south carolina georgia virginia kentucky ohio pennsylvania and 
illinois the indictment said 
the issue of such health insurance scams was the subject of a 
hearing last spring in the us senate and de la rosa said his 
office is investigating about three dzen similar schemes 
the victims number in the tens of thousands with unpaid 
medical claims totaling in the tens of millions of dollars he 
said 
six men were arrested tuesday robert w long victor s 
blackwell and jerry m wolicki of charlotte david r harris of 
greenville sc michael a krebser of stuart fla and michael 
h spieles of palm city fla 
in an accompanying civil action officials also seized seven 
homes 26 vehicles and business and personal bank accounts from the 
men the property was worth 3 million officials said 
long and blackwell made short court appearances tuesday morning 
where they were released on bond said us attorney tom ashcraft 
ashcraft said the seized assets would be used to help the 
victims of the scam but it would be a mistake to think there is 
a big pot of gold out there 
de la rosa said the biggest tragedy was that many of the victims 
were left uninsurable 
this has had a catastrophic effect on many of these people who 
have been refused expensive and medically necessary care because 
they lack health insurance and they may never be able to obtain it 
for any preexisting conditions de la rosa said 
the charges listed in the indictment include mail fraud money 
laundering embezzlement and conspiracy

the ruling communist party in albania 
the last country practicing stalinism in europe on tuesday decided 
to allow the formation of other political parties the state news 
agency ata said 
the surprise announcement in the country of 31 million 
residents was made in a communique released after a meeting of the 
partys policysetting central committee in the capital of tirana 
the plenum was of the opinion that the creation of independent 
political organizations according to the law in force is to the 
good of the further democratization of the life of the country and 
pluralism the ata report said 
the balkan nation which opened its borders slightly this year 
after decades of isolationism under the late enver hoxha would be 
the last country in europe to introduce a multiparty system 
albania broke relations with the soviet union in 1961 over 
hoxhas stalinist and prochinese policies sixteen years later 
albania severed ties with the chinese 
albania has scheduled elections for feb 10 they are seen as a 
test of the governments willingness to live up to pledges of 
gradual reform and of the peoples ability to exercise a measure of 
political freedom after decades of authoritarian rule 
but it was not immediately clear if there will be enough time 
for new political parties to form and compete in the elections 
the central committee meeting was held following student unrest 
that started this weekend and continued tuesday with a protest of 
between 2000 and 3000 students 
ata said the central committee also fired five full members and 
two candidate members of the politburo and called on premier adil 
carcani to make the necessary changes in his government 
yugoslav and other observers believed the politburo reshuffle 
and the call for the creation of independent parties amounted to a 
defeat of the hardliners led by nexhmie hoxha 69 widow of hoxha 
who died five years ago 
it scheduled an party congress for june 1991 and a national 
party meeting on dec 26 to define the electoral platform of the 
party and endorse the list of its candidates for deputies to the 
peoples assembly 
earlier tuesday students demanded communist authorities provide 
more heat and light for their dormitories 
president ramiz alia has conceded albanias economy was on the 
brink of a state of emergency a severe drought has curbed power 
supplies most of albanias power comes from hydroelectric plants 
the students gathered outside their rooms in tirana and stayed 
away from classes on tirana universitys campus on the edge of the 
city diplomats in tirana said 
the diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said police 
were out in force apparently to keep the students away from the 
public no violence or arrests were reported 
on sunday several students were hurt and detained in clashes 
with clubwielding police diplomats said 
ata monitored in vienna took the unusual step of reporting 
unrest on sunday and monday 
alia met with student representatives late tuesday and urged 
them to return to classes or else incidents which nobody desires 
could occur 
according to radio tirana monitored in london alia told the 
students that top national leaders had followed the protests and 
from the beginning had expressed themselves in favor of dialogue 
the students told alia their idea of creating an independent 
political organization of students and young intellectuals and 
alia said they could submit their demand for registration to the 
ministry of justice 
the government acted relatively swiftly to defuse a political 
crisis in july when thousands of albanians streamed into foreign 
embassies in tirana taking refuge until being allowed to emigrate 
since then the communist leadership which has tinkered with 
economic and political reform following eastern europes 1989 
revolutions has come under further pressure with the defection of 
ismail kadare the countrys greatest writer he fled in october 
saying his hopes that alia could become albanias mikhail gorbachev 
had been dashed

the soviet unions top diplomat will meet here 
on wednesday with the leader of the angolan rebel group which has 
been fighting the sovietbacked government for more than 15 years 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze told a news 
conference in houston where he was winding up discussions with 
secretary of state james a baker iii that he has agreed to meet 
with jonas savimbi whose unita rebels have been fighting the 
leftist government in luanda since shortly after it seized power 
it is the first meeting between shevardnadze and savimbi 
at the same time the state department announced that angolan 
foreign minister pedro de castro van dunem will meet separately 
with baker on wednesday baker met with angolan president jose 
eduardo dos santos last march in namibia 
the united states and the soviet union have been supporting 
rival factions in angolas civil war but lately have been 
encouraging the two sides to reach a negotiated settlement 
we are trying to do what we can to help bring the parties 
closer together so the next round of negotiations set for january 
in lisbon will be successful a state department official said 
this is a major development that demonstrates continued 
sovietamerican efforts to cooperate on these issues said the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the official said the savimbishevardnadze meeting was 95 per 
cent nailed down before baker opened talks with the soviet 
diplomat on monday in houston 
savimbi spent part of the day in washington conferring with 
state department officials 
in lisbon an angolan government spokesman said the foreign 
minister or other angolan officials would not see savimbi in 
washington 
a joint statement of baker and shevardnadze issued late in the 
day tuesday said the meetings will discuss such issues as a 
ceasefire free participation of unita and other parties in 
angolas political process and the convening of free elections with 
monitoring by neutral observers 
also on the agenda will be the termination of deliveries of all 
lethal material to angola after agreement on a ceasefire 
according to official us estimates the soviet union has 
continued to send hundreds of millions of dollars worth of weapons 
into angola last fall congress approved legislation that would 
halt the 60 million a year aid to the angolan rebels if the 
angolan government agrees to a free election and the soviets halt 
arms deliveries to government forces 
angola was a portuguese colony until 1974 when the withdrawal 
of the colonial government set off a scramble for power won by a 
marxist group 
during the following years of the cold war angola was a 
divisive issue for the superpowers and according to angolan 
government figures 350000 people lost their lives in the 
fighting 
cuba first sent troops to support angolas marxist government in 
1975 and not long thereafter congress forbade us support for 
government opponents during the reagan administration congress 
lifted the prohibition and covert us aid to unita began in 1986 
in december 1988 president fidel castro agreed to a phased 
withdrawal of his forces a process that is scheduled to end next 
july the agreement was brokered by the united states and received 
strong encouragement from the soviets 
but progress toward a settlement in angola has been halting a 
ceasefire agreed to last year broke down quickly and government 
forces launched an offsensive a year ago against unita 
on the plus side the angolas ruling party agreed this past 
weekend to open the way to a multiparty system which has long 
been a key savimbi demand

nearly 500 more foreigners flew out of iraq and occupied kuwait 
on tuesday ending four months captivity following the iraqi 
invasion of the oilrich emirate 
one freed british hostage said he saw bodies on the street 
outside his kuwait hideout tuesday morning 
three chartered flights brought 243 foreigners from kuwait to 
baghdad to join hundreds of other hostages on three chartered 
jetliners that left iraq for bangkok london and frankfurt 
callum strachan dressed in a traditional kilt from his native 
scotland saluted the other hostages by playing his bagpipes as the 
foreigners cleared iraqi passport control 
the people who deserve the greatest admiration are the 
kuwaitis who sheltered us despite the fact that they could be 
executed on the spot if they were found helping us said 
61yearold briton ken emsden 
he said there still was gunfire every night in kuwait and that 
he saw the bodies of four civilians in the street tuesday morning 
were just happy its finally over said sid hatcher 35 of 
knoxville tenn who was held at an industrial site in iraq 
diplomats said just 14 americans were on the flights from 
baghdad seven headed to frankfurt and seven to london there were 
no americans on the flight from kuwait to baghdad 
we must have gotten them all said one american consular 
official referring to earlier evacuation flights from the persian 
gulf emirate he spoke on condition of anonymity 
in washington the bush administration said a planned evacuation 
flight thursday is likely to be the last for americans and will 
probably also carry home the remaining staff of the us embassy in 
kuwait 
we would anticipate that once all americans who want out have 
been able to get out that we would remove the entire staff of the 
embassy said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
in frankfurt germany us consulate spokesman craig springer 
said seven americans two canadians two britons an irishman an 
italian and an australian were on the uschartered iraqi airways 
boeing 707 that landed there late tuesday from baghdad 
before departure diplomats said six britons were aboard and did 
not mention an australian or italian the discrepancy was not 
explained immediately 
springer said the former hostages would stay overnight and fly 
to their final destinations wednesday on regular commercial 
flights 
the flight to london carried about 310 people nearly all of 
them britons but including seven americans they arrived late 
tuesday at gatwick airport outside london 
a japanesechartered jetliner left baghdad for bangkok with 159 
people aboard including 14 japanese diplomats from kuwait nearly 
all the others were former japanese hostages 
state department spokesman richard boucher said in washington 
that more than 500 americans most of them children are remaining 
in kuwait and iraq some because of roots there in other cases 
because the nonamerican head of household could not get iraqi 
permission to leave 
boucher said that except for three americans with visa problems 
all americans wanting to leave apparently have left so far as is 
known 
after his troops seized kuwait on aug 2 iraqi president saddam 
hussein barred many foreigners from leaving and detained some 
foreigners at strategic sites to ward off a possible attack last 
week saddam said all foreigners who wanted to leave could do so 
the united nations has authorized the use of force to liberate 
kuwait unless iraq withdraws by jan 15 by that date the usled 
multinational force assembled in the gulf and saudi arabia after 
the invasion will include more than 500000 troops about the same 
size as the iraqi force in and around kuwait 
in other developments tuesday 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir said he and president 
bush have smoothed relations between their two countries we have 
reached general understanding more or less on all the moves in 
the gulf and on israels position shamir told reporters after 
meeting with bush in washington he did not provide details 
libyas official news agency jana said libya has asked iraq 
to hand over some american hostages to libya the agency said libya 
wants to exchange the americans for former libyan prisoners of war 
who were taken from chad the report did not give any numbers 
france said it will send nearly 4000 more soldiers to saudi 
arabia by jan 15 boosting its deployment there to about 10000 
the first of 170 czechoslovak chemical decontamination experts 
left for saudi arabia czechoslovakias ctk news agency said all 
the volunteers will be in the gulf region by weeks end

imported oil and spending for overseas military operations helped 
boost the deficit in the broadest measure of foreign trade to 
2559 billion in the third quarter up 139 percent

fouryearold falah saah too weak from 
starvation to cry out could only murmur listlessly as he lay in 
his mothers lap 
i want drink drink drink he said softly nearly drowned 
out by the moans from other sick children in the ward at island 
hospital one of only two hospitals still operating in monrovia 
the capital of warwrecked liberia 
his mother maita solui said he is one of only three of her 
seven children to survive the west african countrys yearlong civil 
war 
hundreds of children have died of starvation and doctors say 
that unless a huge food aid program is launched thousands more 
will succumb 
other youngsters brutalized by seeing mothers raped and 
fathers brothers and sisters killed became child soldiers in the 
rebel armies falahs eldest brother joined up and was killed 
the physical and mental condition of the surviving children has 
raised fears about the future generation of this west african 
nation relief workers say the degree of starvation has been so 
great that many children who live will suffer brain damage 
the child soldiers suffer in other ways at the rebel base in 
caldwell outside the capital a young boy played with a 
remotecontrol toy car draped over his shoulder was a machine gun 
a real one 
im a man i have killed like a man boasted another little 
boy he looked 6 or 7 years old with a gun nearly as tall as he 
was but refused to give his age 
for orphans who have watched their parents killed by liberian 
troops the rebel camp offered a substitute family food and an 
opportunity for revenge 
they are still little children but how are we going to 
convince them of that when its all over said myrtle gibson a 
real estate agent who turned to relief work how are we going to 
make them real people again 
after this war were going to have a lot more wars to 
fight 
hunger is the most immediate problem starving monrovians ate 
the citys pet dogs and cats months ago they ate zoo animals 
including chimpanzees then they turned to the vegetation eating 
weeds and slashing down palm trees to eat the filling but 
nonnutritious fiber under the bark 
a little food is on sale bunches of green leaves and weeds 
some stolen tinned goods a few oranges looted rice but few can 
afford it 
the belgian branch of the international aid group doctors 
without borders started supplementary feeding now reaching 3000 
children with help from newly arrived united nations workers 
un representative michael heyn said the relief workers hoped 
to soon feed 25000 children but he said 90000 children in 
monrovia alone need a special diet to recover 
the world community has focused mainly on the political and 
military aspects of the crisis but does not realize yet that the 
liberian people are literally starving and dying particularly the 
children he said 
island hospital has become a center for orphans of the war 
children who have lost their parents in panicked rushes away from 
the fighting then there are the wounded like a little girl whose 
leg had to be amputated a boy who lost an eye 
ellen james a nurse at the hospital goes out on the streets 
with other health workers to bring in starving children but they 
can only help a few 
we pick up 10 maybe 12 meanwhile they are dying in their 
hundreds she said 
it is difficult to find a child who is not suffering from 
severe malnutrition said dr richard ndamse one of six 
volunteers working at the hospital for a token payment of six cups 
of rice a month 
the hospital has no running water and little electricity a 
generator was turned on only for emergency operations because of a 
fuel shortage monrovia has been without running water electricity 
and regular food supplies for six months 
the victims in the war have been mostly civilians it is not 
known how many have died certainly more than the 10000 killed in 
the fighting that began last dec 23 
monrovia was once a city of about 425000 people about 
onequarter of whom remain according to the united nations more 
than 750000 liberians have fled to neighboring countries 
the war began a rebellion against the corrupt and oppressive 
government of the late president samuel doe and turned into a 
tribal conflict with three warring armies 
they agreed to a ceasefire on nov 28 but an interim 
government and other provisions still remain to be negotiated

the georgian legislature tuesday abolished the 
autonomy of a separatist minority in the southern republic news 
reports said the vote could set up a new confrontation in the 
region 
also tuesday the kirgiz legislature elected a new speaker 
during a session expected to take up a sovereignty declaration the 
central asian republic is the only one of 15 republics that has not 
declared some form of autonomy or sovereignty 
the law by the recently elected georgian supreme soviet 
legislature would end 68 years of autonomy for ossetia a small 
enclave in the northern part of the republic that has demanded 
greater selfrule 
ossetia is one of 20 autonomous areas in the soviet union which 
have limited jurisdiction over their affairs a handful have 
declared themselves full republics like other ethnic groups they 
fear rising nationalism by republic leaders 
ossetians last week elected their own legislature but ethnic 
georgians living in the region boycotted the vote according to the 
independent news agency interfax 
the state news agency tass quoted observers as saying soviet 
interior ministry troops would be necessary if the georgian 
parliament imposes a curfew and a state of emergency in ossentia 
soviet troops have been deployed in georgia and other republics 
following ethnic tension although some hardliners have demanded 
more soldiers to stop all secessionist drives 
president mikhail s gorbachev replaced his moderate interior 
minister vadim bakatin last week with former latvian kgb chief 
boris pugo hardliners welcomed the appointment and predicted a 
crackdown to stop fragmentation of the union 
tuesday in kirgizia the legislature elected medetkan 
shermikulov 51 as speaker of their chamber tass said he will 
replace absamat masaliev who resigned monday to concentrate on his 
duties as kirgiz communist party chief 
the kirgiz legislature also planned to consider resolutions on 
republic sovereignty and its stance on gorbachevs proposed 
national union treaty 
tass did not say whether the legislature took the measures

the government unveiled its 3 billion green 
plan on tuesday promising to create five new national parks by 
1996 and to set aside 12 percent of canadian territory to safeguard 
wildlife and ecosystems 
environment minister robert de cotrets plan includes more than 
100 measures to protect canadas land water soil forests and 
wildlife over the next five years 
three billion dollars is a lot of money de cotret said at a 
news conference thats three thousand million dollars its all 
fresh new money the only thing recycled in the green plan is the 
paper its written on 
however opposition spokesmen and environmentalists criticized 
the plan calling it vague and lacking emphasis on enforcement of 
pollution regulations 
this document will do nothing to help the canadian 
ecosystem said dan mcdermott a spokesman for greenpeace it 
is neither green nor a plan 
the plan includes a commitment to put aside oneeighth of 
canadian territory as protected space for wildlife and 
ecosystems almost double the existing 69 percent 
however that goal will require the cooperation of the 
provinces and some have already indicated they dont support it 
said lee clark parliamentary secretary to de cotret 
the green plan promises the virtual elimination of toxic 
pollution and reduction of emissions that cause groundlevel ozone 
the major ingredient in urban smog 
it sets aside 100 million for an environmental initiative in 
the arctic but offers few details on the strategy the plan also 
sets a goal of cutting canadas garbage production in half by 2000 
it promises new legislation on the safety of drinking water 
protection of wild animals and plants promotion of energy 
efficiency and dumping of waste in the oceans 
the plan promises to establish at least five new national parks 
within six years

candles towboat lights and truck horns 
briefly united residents of dozens of midwest cities along the ohio 
and mississippi rivers tuesday night in a tribute to soldiers in 
operation desert shield 
residents in at least 47 cities in six states most of them 
small towns along the ohio river took part in the candlelight 
ceremonies at 645 pm said organizer marvin peter of evansville 
my son is over there and the only way i can help him is to 
show people i am patriotic and support him doing his duty whatever 
it is said lee wright who held a candle in a gathering of more 
than 1000 people at evansvilles riverfront 
some of the ceremonies were sponsored by chambers of commerce 
and others were organized by support groups for soldiers families 
the tribute lasted about a half an hour 
vietnam veteran russell abrams was one of several hundred people 
who heard the national anthem and watched as candles were lit in 
owensboro ky 
abrams said he wished a similar ceremony had replaced the 
protests during his three years at war it would have done my 
heart a lot of good to know this was going on at home instead of 
what was he said 
in louisville ky about more than 200 people sang america 
the beautiful and other patriotic songs about 150 people in 
cincinnati sang let their be peace on earth and a passing 
barge blew its horn and flashed a light skyward 
residents of cities in pennsylvania illinois virginia and 
tennessee also took part peter said 
trucks on the interstate passed the word by cb radio to honk 
their horns for five minutes at 645 and churches rang their bells 
peter said some of the cities were pretty far inland like 
jackson tenn and some places in central indiana 
evansville and two other ohio river cities henderson and 
owensboro in kentucky were the first to plan the event after 
that the idea spread up and down the river and along the 
mississippi river peter said 
its just mushroomed like crazy he said you look at the 
whole thing and thats thousands and thousands of people 
the event was meant to signal support for the soldiers and their 
families but made no statement about the us military buildup in 
the persian gulf prompted by iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
peter said 
you hear lots about the little groups of antiwar 
demonstrators he said but this is midamerica very quietly 
doing their thing 
almost 90 towboats operated by american commercial barge line 
co were instructed to shine their lights into the air at 645 pm 
and blow their whistles vice president chris brinkop said from the 
companys jeffersonville ind headquarters 
most of the boats were on the ohio river he said with some on 
the mississippi river as well 
i cant say that i remember anything like this happening 
before brinkop said 
he said the towboat crews were sympathetic with the plight of 
soldiers and their families who are separated by operation desert 
shield 
we have crews out at christmas and we know thats a terrible 
hard time to be away from home he said 
peter said the ceremony began with united we stand a support 
group he formed in august for evansville familes of soldiers 
serving in operation desert shield 
peters son 21yearold pfc eric peter is stationed in saudi 
arabia with the armys 82nd airborne division out of fort bragg 
nc 
what you have here i think is a major show of support for the 
troops and the families peter said everyone hopes for 
peace

a worker in charge of a bungee jump 
that ended in death was sentenced wednesday to 200 hours of 
community service after being convicted of manslaughter 
high court justice thomas thorp said jailing 19yearold jason 
john collett would achieve nothing 
collett was in charge of an amusement park bungee jump on feb 
10 when thomas wayne hemi 19 died of multiple injuries after 
hitting the ground 
participants in the thrillseeking support jump from a bridge or 
other high place with an elasticized bungee cord attached to their 
ankles that is designed to stop their fall just above the surface 
hemis cord had not been properly secured to the tower from which 
he plunged 
the judge said hemi was colletts friend and the memory of what 
happened would stay with him throughout his life 
collett had clearly been unacceptably lackadaisical on the 
bungee tower thorp said the jury had however added a strong 
plea for mercy with its verdict

the truck stops here says vincent 
gramuglia at least until he can figure out his next move 
gramuglias controversial tractortrailer truck sign was pulled 
monday from its 50foot perch alongside the new york state thruway 
and became lodged against the same storage tank it was ordered 
removed from by a judge 
weve got a unique problem gramuglia said the truck is 
stuck 
gramuglias 55foot rig sat atop an empty oil storage tank and 
served as a huge billboard to advertise the three truck stops 
four motels and seven restaurants available off the highway in 
fultonville about 40 miles west of albany 
after a yearlong battle with thruway authority officials who 
said the sign was a distraction to motorists gramuglia agreed in 
state supreme court last week to take the sign down on monday 
with about 75 people and three television news crews on hand he 
tried to do just that 
gramuglia owner of the countryside fuel stop said he used 
torches to cut where the truck was welded to a huge steel ibeam 
he placed rollers under the ibeam greased the whole operation 
with italian olive oil and used a tow trucks winch to pull the 
truck off 
when the 12ton truck fell its back end wedged itself 4 to 6 
feet into the ground with the cab leaning on the storage tank 
gramuglia said further attempts to winch the truck off resulted in 
two broken steel cables he said 
they cant say we didnt comply with the supreme court 
ruling said gramuglia who admitted he was having a good laugh 
over the problem well take it off eventually but well leave 
it like that for a few days 
its more of distraction now than it was when it was sitting 
on top of the tank he said

the bush administration plans to ask us 
allies to chip in more money to offset the enormous cost of sending 
and sustaining more than 400000 american troops in the persian 
gulf the pentagon said tuesday 
the pentagon also announced that iraq now has more than half a 
million troops in and around kuwait 50000 more than us 
intelligence estimates of a week ago and five times the size of the 
army that invaded kuwait on aug 2 
defense secretary dick cheney on monday said a continuing iraqi 
buildup indicated that president saddam hussein has no intention of 
giving up kuwait despite the optimism generated by saddams 
release of american and other hostages 
in an interview tuesay night on cnns larry king live 
program white house chief of staff john sununu was asked if 
hussein would pull out of kuwait i think right now its 5050 
and its hard to give a better answer than that sununu replied 
as a second planeload of americans left iraq on tuesday bound 
for frankfurt germany and then the united states the white house 
said an evacuation flight scheduled for thursday probably will be 
the last to leave iraq and probably will carry the remaining staff 
of the us embassy in kuwait 
we would anticipate that once all americans who want out have 
been able to get out that we would remove the entire staff of the 
embassy said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
fitzwater said that for diplomatic and political purposes bush 
would like to leave the american flag flying above the embassy to 
signify that it is an active us outpost 
from a practical matter we wont have anyone there to raise 
the flag so thatll just play itself out fitzwater said 
the evacuation of us civilians coincided with a further 
buildup of us troops in the area 
pete williams a pentagon spokesman said american air sea and 
ground forces in the gulf area have risen by 10000 since last 
week to 260000 the latest arrivals apparently are the lead 
elements of a huge us reinforcement that president bush ordered 
nov 8 to strengthen the us offensive capability 
by late january about 430000 us army navy air force and 
marine corps personnel are expected to be in the area the largest 
us expeditionary force since the vietnam war 
williams also announced that ground sea and air forces 
dispatched to the gulf area from britain france and 24 other 
allied nations now total more than 220000 he said he could not 
disclose how many forces were sent by each country 
bushs decision to expand operation desert shield deployments 
beyond the 240000 originally planned in august threw a monkey 
wrench into the pentagons efforts to estimate future costs and it 
added urgency to determining how much more money and materials 
allied nations may be willing to contribute 
williams said allies have offered 65 billion in assistance 
through dec 31 
we will probably seek additional support from other nations to 
continue their share of the responsibility for desert shield 
williams said adding that the pentagon has not yet determined how 
much the operation will cost next year 
the pentagons original estimate of 15 billion for the budget 
year that began oct 1 is no longer valid williams said because 
it was made before bush ordered the us reinforcements 
pentagon and congressional sources said monday the 1991 cost of 
the operation could be about 30 billion but they stressed that 
estimates are uncertain because of fluctuations in fuel prices and 
other changing circumstances the biggest unknown is whether the 
us forces will go to war 
williams didnt say which allies would be asked to increase 
their contributions or when 
the leading contributors to the us military operation since it 
began aug 7 are kuwait saudi arabia japan germany and the 
united arab emirates williams said 
williams said kuwait has provided the most aid so far 25 
billion in cash saudi arabia has provided services and materials 
such as transportation food and fuel valued at 987 million 
through oct 31 williams said he said the saudis unlike other 
allies have made an openended offer of assistance for the 
duration of the standoff with iraq 
japan has provided 376 million in cash and 50 million in 
materials or services and germany has given 272 million in cash 
and 65 million in support williams said neither of those 
countries has sent military forces to the gulf 
williams said congress in passing a supplemental appropriation 
of 19 billion for desert shield expenses for august and 
september established a defense cooperation account into which all 
allied financial aid is being deposited the balance in the account 
as of nov 30 was 39 billion williams said

a millionaire who underwrote auburn 
universitys hiring of a controversial catholic theologian says he 
will give no more to the school that denied tenure to the rev 
charles curran 
i understand theyre taking it out on him because hes a 
catholic some of my best friends are catholic jw goodwin 
owner of a birmingham engineering firm said monday in a story 
tuesday in the montgomery advertiser 
goodwin backed away from the comment tuesday saying he didnt 
know if curran was denied tenure because of his religion 
goodwin told the associated press on tuesday he wrote his alma 
mater out of his will because of a personal matter but would 
not elaborate 
it didnt have anything to do with that preacher goodwin 
said 
auburn university president james martin has refused to make 
public the reason he gave curran a oneyear contract rather than 
the security of a tenured position when curran was named 
goodwinphilpott eminent scholar in religion beginning with the 
1990 fall term 
goodwin 86 who donated 600000 to set up the chair at auburn 
said it did not bother him that curran has been censured by the 
vatican for arguing that in some circumstances homosexual acts and 
abortion might not be sinful 
martin met privately friday with the 13member 
facultycontrolled promotions and tenure committee but his reason 
for denying curran tenure remained secret while the committee that 
had overwhelmingly recommended last may that curran be given tenure 
issued a statement in support of martins action some faculty 
leaders said the problem had been aggravated 
i am fully anticipating some rather strong reaction from the 
faculty if they cannot fathom the meaning of all this said 
auburn faculty senate president gary mullen 
the university senate is expected to address the issue jan 8 
ronald henry an auburn vice president who is chairman of the 
tenure committee said he would never disclose martins 
nonacademic reasons for denying tenure 
curran replied if they admit its a nonacademic judgment 
they have admitted its a violation of academic freedom 
goodwin said martin and former auburn president harry philpott 
told him that curran was the man they thought would be good for 
the job and i said if its all right with you its all right 
with me 
some faculty members had speculated earlier that martin was 
under pressure from catholic quarters not to give curran a 
longterm post but goodwin said he was convinced martin was 
persuaded by an unnamed member of the board of trustees not to make 
currans hiring permanent because the trustee objected to the fact 
that curran was catholic 
curran was added to a twomember religion department that 
already has a tenured catholic professor 
goodwins 600000 donation was part of some 8 million he has 
contributed to his alma mater over the years 
goodwin a 1929 engineering graduate first let his displeasure 
be known in a letter to martin informing him that he had stopped 
bids on a new veterinary building he was bankrolling until this 
curran thing is cleared up 
auburns college of veterinary medicine was planning to use a 
large contribution from goodwin to build a 750000 laboratory for 
the artificial breeding of horses 
id be glad to reconsider said goodwin but theyre going 
to have to get some people off that board of trustees im not 
going to let them play hankypanky with the money i worked like 
hell for

pilots to help them bomb installations of a subcontractor for the 
american company mobil oil corp in a northern jungle region a 
leftist senator said tuesday 
sen edmundo murugarra said about 150 members of the tupac amaru 
revolutionary movement hit drilling operations monday in the upper 
huallaga river valley 
he said the rebels forced the pilots to fly over the site while 
the guerrillas dynamited the installations from the air 
the minister of energy and mines fernando sanchez albavera 
said tuesday the attack caused 3 million in damage he said it was 
important to stress mobils decision to continue to work in 
peru despite the raid 
mobil and us embassy officials refused to comment on the 
attack 
the upper huallaga is a cocarich jungle area 200 miles 
northeast of lima it also contains most of perus oil reserves

of coca leaf the raw material for cocaine 
hundreds of guerrillas from both of perus main rebel groups 
operate in the area providing protection for drug traffickers in 
exchange for arms and cash 
tupac amaru a smaller and less dangerous rebel organization 
than the maoistoriented shining path movement started attacks in 
1984 
guerrillas thought to belong to shining path on tuesday tried to 
assassinate a district attorney in cuzco 350 miles southeast of 
lima police said 
cuzco the ancient inca capital and gateway to the inca citadel 
machu picchu is one of perus principal tourist attractions the 
city has been relatively free of guerrilla attacks except for a 
car bomb three months ago 
shining path rebels on monday bombed state electricity company 
offices in the northern mountain city of huaraz police said 
tuesday 
huaraz 175 miles north of lima is a popular area for 
backpackers and mountain climbers guerrilla violence has increased 
in the area since the shining path killed a british backpacker 
outside huaraz in may 1989 
more than 21000 people have died in political violence since

two chain reaction crashes in dense fog on 
a highway in southeastern tennessee killed 15 people tuesday 
injured more than 50 and left the roadway looking like a war zone 
a morning fog covered interstate 75 over the hiwassee river 
about 40 miles north of chattanooga when the 75vehicle pileup 
began about 930 am said cecil whaley director of the tennessee 
emergency management agency 
people involved in the accident which covered more than a mile 
of the interstate described hearing booms in the fog as dozens of 
tractortrailers collided with each other and with cars 
traveling salesman ralph fisher of cleveland tenn was headed 
north when he hit the fog patch he said he noticed traffic slowing 
down so he pulled to the roadside 
after that i started hearing bangs and booms from everywhere 
immediately after that there was a truck on fire from across the 
road we stared hearing them banging and booming from over there 
then all of a sudden you started hearing them from everywhere 
said fisher 43 
whaley confirmed 15 dead but said the number could rise as 
crews searched the burned shells of vehicles in some cases only 
nameplates distinguished the wreckage of a car smashed into the 
side of a truck 
this is one of the worst accidents that anyone can remember 
happening in tennessee in terms of the number of vehicles and 
fatalities involved said whaley who followed rescue efforts 
from his nashville office 
names of the victims would not be immediately released because 
some of the bodies were burned beyond recognition whaley said 
authorities believe an initial accident occurred in the 
southbound lane and cars jumping the median or people 
rubbernecking to see the southbound crash may have caused the 
second pileup in the northbound lane 
from there authorities say it was a ghastly chain reaction 
russell newman eastern district regional director of the 
tennessee emergency medical agency says no one is really sure what 
happened 
its just a conjecture as to what caused it but it was just 
one of those damn chain reaction collisions that happen in this 
kind of situation very heavy fog and probably too much speed 
newman said 
in washington the national transportation safety board said it 
was dispatching a sixperson team of experts in highway and 
hazardous material investigations 
one northbound lane of the interstate was reopened to traffic 
tuesday afternoon tema official gary beazley said he didnt know 
when the other lanes would be reopened 
efforts earlier in the day to remove the injured to hospitals in 
athens and cleveland were hampered because of wreckage helicopters 
from knoxville and chattanooga helped with the evacuation 
joe wilson spokesman for the bradley county emergency 
management agency said the worst of the accident was centered at a 
bridge over the hiwassee river where the worst of the accident was 
centered 
bradley memorial treated 24 people and athens community hospital 
received 20 people people were treated for lacerations multiple 
trauma burns fractures contusions and smoke inhalation 
at least six seriously injured people were airlifted to 
chattanoogas erlanger hospital and one was transported to the 
university of tennessee medical center in knoxville whaley said 
he said about 20 of the 51 injured had been released from 
hospitals 
some troopers were overcome by fumes shortly after the accident 
but officials said the danger had dissipated by midday a propane 
tanker involved in the wreck was not damaged officials said

race relations will suffer if the 
university of alabama plays in the fiesta bowl in arizona where 
voters rejected a holiday honoring martin luther king jr a black 
leader said tuesday 
state rep alvin holmes alabama naacp president lillian jackson 
and several other black leaders met with university president roger 
sayers to discuss their concerns over the planned trip to the jan 
1 college football bowl in tempe ariz 
the fact that alabama one of the states major institutions is 
planning to participate in the event is particularly significant 
holmes said 
here in the state of alabama was where dr martin luther king 
was thrust into international leadership he said it was here 
in the state of alabama where martin luther king received his 
greatest resistance to the civil rights movement and it was here in 
the state of alabama where former gov george wallace stood in 
the schoolhouse door 
of all universities in the nation the university of alabama 
should be the last one to play in a state where they refuse to 
honor dr king holmes said 
holmes said he wants the team to pull out of the game against 
louisville 
the black leaders presented a list of demands to sayers which 
included hiring a black university vice president and establishing 
a scholarship for black students 
sayers said the university will consider the proposals and come 
up with a package next week 
kings daughter yolanda king canceled an acting performance in 
a musical play in arizona on sunday because she felt her presence

montgomery on tuesday evening 
hunts press secretary terry abbott said the governor told 
lowery he respectfully disagreed with his stance and that hunt 
knows well that university officials are very sensitive to the 
issues 
i understand his position and i hope he understands mine

north korea said wednesday that peace 
on the divided korean peninsula must be achieved without 
interference from outsiders and it indirectly attacked seouls 
alliances with both washington and moscow 
we only wonder when this dependence on outside forces and 
flunkylike way of thinking impairing national dignity and 
interests will disappear premier yon hyong muk of north korea 
said 
he spoke at the opening of the third round of talks between 
himself and south korean premier kang younghoon 
if we depend upon foreign forces we cannot but be subjected 
to their interference cannot but be worried about their 
attitude yon said you are entreating foreign countries for 
intervention and interference in an endeavor to force your will 
the talks are meant to ease political and military tensions on 
the peninsula 
south korean president roh taewoo flies to moscow thursday for 
a summit with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev moscow a 
longtime ally of the communist north established diplomatic 
relations with seoul two months ago rohs trip has been bitterly 
critized by the north as an attempt to sabotage the talks 
the opening day session lasted about two hours and both sides 
offered proposals which were little changed in substance from past 
talks no major agreement is expected but the talks are seen as 
one more step in the lengthy process of drawing the two nations 
closer 
the talks to conclude thursday are the third round since 
september and the highestlevel meetings between the koreas since 
the peninsula was divided in 1945 and the border tightly sealed 
yon demanded immediate withdrawal of 43000 us troops based in 
south korea withdrawal of us nuclear weapons he claims are 
stored in the south and a halt to the annual ussouth korean 
military maneuver called team spirit 
he asked direct talks between north korea and washington on 
replacing the 1953 armistice agreement which ended the 195053 
korean war with a peace treaty south korea refused to sign the 
armistice 
south korea urged the north to sign a basic agreement aimed at 
easing 45 years of confrontation and to accept two ideological 
systems pending unification 
south korea warned the north to cease what it said was its 
slandering of roh and to end contacts with south korean dissidents 
your side has continued to slander and revile our side even 
though you have agreed to talk peace and reconciliation said 
kang 
your side is inciting and encouraging certain dissidents in 
the south to conduct illegal activities 
north korea has demanded the release of dissidents jailed for 
unauthorized contact with the north a matter the seoul government 
calls meddling in domestic affairs 
on tuesday hours after the north korean premier crossed the

the school but were driven back by 500 students yonhap said

city officials sought tuesday to close a 
nightclub owned by rap singer luther campbell of 2 live crew after 
one man was killed and another wounded in a weekend gunfight there 
city attorney alex vilarello filed papers tuesday in dade 
circuit court seeking an injunction closing the strawberry too 
club he said a hearing on the request was not expected before 
friday 
campbell who has owned the club for two years was acquitted of 
obscenity charges in floridas broward county in october that 
stemmed from a concert featuring songs from his groups album as 
nasty as they wanna be also acquitted were 2 live crew members 
mark brother marquis ross and chris fresh kid ice wongwon 
the hialeah city council meeting in emergency session monday 
ordered vilarello to seek the injunction after saturday mornings 
gunfight terrorized an estimated 200 patrons of the club 
police said the shooting was the latest violent outburst at the 
club where two people were wounded in another gunfight in the 
parking lot last july 
forty to 60 percent of available manpower is being expended at 
this location continuously said police chief rolando bolanos 
police say they have been summoned to the club 128 times this 
year including five times for shootings 
campbell said police were to blame for not controlling crowds 
outside the club 
i think the city of hialeah is full of it personally because 
every club in the city of miami miami beach all over the county 
has police outside of the club campbell said 
police said saturdays incident began about 4 am when 
campbells bodyguard robert mulkey poked timothy taylor 22 in 
the head and told him he couldnt enter the club which was being 
used for a private party 
taylor allegedly hit mulkey over the head with a portable 
telephone and fled police said mulkey then hit taylor over the

norway which already has the worlds most 
expensive cigarettes is trying to stop smoking everywhere indoors 
and wipe out the habit in a decade 
even a smokers home may not be his castle for long schools and 
daycare centers tell children about the dangers of passive smoking 
and encourage them to tell their parents to quit or smoke outside 
norwegians with tobacco habits are responding by rolling their 
own cigarettes using butts over again taking snuff and smoking on 
balconies 
tore sanner a professor at the oslo cancer institute and head 
of the smokefree campaign granted that the number of smokers has 
remained constant for 10 years despite increasingly aggressive 
measures 
about 12 million norwegians smoke or 37 percent of the 
population but fewer young people are starting tobacco 
consumption has dropped only marginally to 6700 metric tons a 
year from 6800 in 1980 
sanner in no mood to give up declared you saw what happened 
to the berlin wall nobody thought it would fall 
tobacco advertising has been prohibited since 1975 smoking is 
forbidden in all public transportation in terminals museums and 
other indoor public places 
a 2yearold law bans smoking in any office where there is more 
than one person 
because 85 percent of the price is taxes and fees a pack of 20 
cigarettes costs 31 kroner or 540 the government proposes to 
raise the price by another 10 percent next year 
some norwegians are as stubborn about smoking as sanner is about 
getting them to quit 
on a snowy day in downtown oslo bjoerne ulvaes 28 took a last 
deep drag before his streetcar arrived he put the cigarette out 
and slid it back into the pack his fingers shaking with cold 
before getting aboard 
you do cut down ulvaes said but added he did not intend to 
quit 
many people doubt they will see a smokefree society in norway 
taxes of 250 percent and numerous restrictions did not stop people 
from drinking alcohol but did lead to widespread bootlegging and 
home distilling 
customers at the manhattan pub laughed shook their heads at the 
idea and continued smoking a saleswoman in a tobacco store said 
trying to end smoking in 10 years was ridiculous and out of touch 
with reality 
nonetheless new restrictions are planned in two years 
restaurants will be required to keep onethird of their space 
smokefree plans are being made to raise the age limit for buying 
tobacco from 16 to 18 
hightar brands probably will be banned and cigarette prices 
will continue going up 
sanner said his campaign alliance which includes the norwegian 
sports association is lobbying to have the price raised 20 percent 
each year 
annemarie mueller of the governments national council on 
tobacco unhealth said new regulations are needed to stem the 
increase in handrolling and the use of snuff 
scandinavians squeeze snuff into a small ball and put it between 
the gum and inner side of the lip more people use it as smoking 
becomes more expensive and restricted 
ms mueller said her council wants prices of all tobacco 
products raised because price is our most important weapon 
smokers have begun organizing against what they call the ban 
mentality 
it is a matter of freedom of choice said thor petter 
krosby a nonsmoker who heads the 2yearold smokers organization 
smokepeace 
there is an air of fanaticism about antismoking activists 
he said in remarks about proposals to ban smoking entirely at oslo 
university indoors or out 
krosby said smokepeace does not encourage people to smoke but 
that most of its 300 members are smokers 
antismokers are trying to soften their image with the help of 
nrk the statecontrolled television network it carries no product 
commercials but does broadcast antismoking advertisements 
some recent ads have a touch of humor in one dracula sinks his 
teeth into the throat of a young chain smoker then staggers away 
coughing smoke pouring from his mouth

david lodge is on his first american publicity 
tour and the english author seems a little dazed 
blame some of it on jet lag the rest on culture shock when his 
first novel came out in 1962 writers didnt give interviews in 
fact lodge waited years before he even had a public reading 
but hell have to adjust this mildmannered author is now 
somewhat a celebrity his claim to fame is such gently mischievous 
novels as changing places small world and nice work 
which has just been issued in paperback 
these stories always have two sides men vs women religion 
vs secularism america vs england and lodge is the referee 
laying down the rules and calmly watching from the sidelines as 
characters collide and opinions crumble 
the very first novel i published the picturegoers is about 
an agnostic boy and a catholic girl and as a result of their 
relationship she becomes agnostic and he becomes religious lodge 
said relaxing in an armchair in his manhattan hotel room 
because i dont have very strong political or idealistic ideas 
to put forth myself i find it easy to put forth novels of 
contrasting views i also find it humorous working on a level 
where everybody understands the rules and obeys them 
lodge born in 1935 grew up in southeast london his childhood 
was often grim and as he writes in the introduction to out of 
the shelter an autobiographical novel his irreverent sense of 
humor was shaped by air raids and postwar austerity 
in nice work the author toys with the stuffy victor wilcox 
and the overeducated robyn penrose throwing them together in an 
uneasy merger of the smokestack and the ivory tower 
wilcox is the manager of an engineering firm his quest for 
identity reaching no further than his resume penrose who teaches 
classes on 19th century industrial novels would rather read about 
factories than actually visit them 
lodge takes these imaginary creatures and sets them in a cage 
called rummidge an english city that occupies for fictional 
purposes the space where birmingham is to be found on maps of 
the socalled real world 
the year is 1986 the government has proclaimed it industry 
year and a university panel has developed an industry year 
shadow scheme a faculty member is to shadow a senior 
management employee in local manufacturing robyn gets the 
assignment her subject naturally is victor 
heres a boymeetsgirl story set against the background of a 
citys crumbling economy victor pompous and materialistic finds 
himself falling in love with this attractive independent woman 
robyn is horrified by her initial exposure to the luecollar 
world but slowly realizes machines and assembly lines are no less 
important than analyses of jane austen 
an encounter is inevitible and lodge keeping the sex safe 
writes with the detached amusement of a nosy neighbor whose ear is 
pressed against the wall 
robyns mood is blythe she feels mildly wanton but not 
wicked she sees herself as not seducing vic but as putting him out 
of his misery perhaps she feels a certain sense of triumph at 
her conquest the captain of industry at the feet of the feminist 
literary critic a pleasing tableau 
for vic the event is indefinitely more momentous his mood 
infinitely more perturbed the prospect of going to bed with robyn 
penrose is the secret dream of weeks come true he regards 
himself with wonderment led by the hand by this handsome young 
woman toward her bedroom as if his soul is stumbling along out of 
step behind his body 
the scene where they actually go to bed together i must have 
written about 10 times it took a lot of thinking explained 
lodge who in 1987 retired as a professor at the university of 
birmingham 
robyn is far more serious even questioning the very idea of 
novels which she attacks as capitalist tools the message of the 
novel is clear she states the alienation of work under 
industrial capitalism can be overcome by an infusion of loving 
kindness and imaginative play 
thats going too far for lodge feminism is up for grabs so are 
religion and politics but the author doesnt mind sounding a 
little dogmatic about writing the only time hes willing to 
solemnly bow his head and offers thanks to a power greater than his 
own 
we learn how to negotiate our lives through novels lodge 
said we learn about experiences beyond our own a novel is not 
the only form that does that but i still think its the most 
versatile of all forms you dont need much money all you need as 
a writer is a pad and a pen 
when you get to my stage of life you dont ask yourself why 
you write its sort of what youve become youre a novelist its 
like being a professional golfer

many people find it easy to support the idea of 
wildlife conservation and the environment until it gets 
uncomfortable until choices and distinctions become difficult to 
make 
thats the tacit message of arctic wars a onehour pbs 
special tonight on alaskas arctic national wildlife refuge which 
already is staked out as the environmental battleground of the 
1990s 
its also the message of africa playing god with nature a 
national geographic explorer special on tbs sunday that shows three 
african nations different approaches to wildlife conservation 
take the tundra at the northeast boundary of alaska beside the 
yukon territory is the 19 millionacre arctic national wildlife 
refuge a wilderness area created by congress in 1980 
under the congressional acts section 1002 the refuges 15 
millionacre coastal plain is exempted from the wilderness 
designation why the oil industry figures the socalled 
tenohtwo lands sit on more than 2 billion barrels of oil 
the 1002 lands are core calving grounds for the porcupine 
caribou and prime habitat for the wolf and grizzly bear 
unfortunately porcupine caribou arent cute grizzlies are scary 
and wolves have suffered from bad press 
its also the homeland of native indians and eskimos who rely on 
the caribou for their subsistence and yet there are alaskans who 
also need jobs in an economy that derives 85 percent of its 
revenues from the oil industry 
what will become of the lands the oil companies insist the 
adjoining oil fields at prudhoe bay are in decline that theyll 
need the oil and that they can get it out and return the wilderness 
to useful tundra 
useful tundra 
the official position of the bush administration concerning 
anwr and other areas is that well go forward with exploration and 
drilling if we can do it in an environmentally sound manner says 
assisant interior secretary david oneil 
arctic wars makes it all too clear that the 1002 lands 
probably would be open to oil exploration and development today if 
it werent for the exxon valdez oil spill of 1989 
as one oil executive argues if you perceive that the 
aesthetics of a drilling rig destroy wilderness then weve reduced 
the argument to one of aesthetics which is a very difficult 
argument 
what arctic wars doesnt make clear is that oil development 
or even extensive recreational use threatens species plants 
animals insects and microscopic life we know nothing about once 
gone it is gone for good 
the other side of conservation is in africa where kenya 
zimbabwe and south africa have taken three fundamentally different 
tacks in managing wildlife 
the problem is most critical in kenya where the worlds highest 
birth rate and endemic poverty have decimated wildlife and habitat 
where humans compete with animals for food and space animals 
always lose 
disastrous policies by kenyas government in the 70s literally 
destroyed one game preserve by overpopulating it with elephants 
and created enormous ill will among its people by denying them 
access to game during famine 
kenyas war on poachers and a worldwide ban on ivory have helped 
save the dwindling elephant herd tourism is kenyas largest source 
of hard currency and that also may help the elephant 
this is small consolation to a kenyan farmer trying to eke out a 
living on lands adjoining unfenced game preserves to him the 
elephant that eats and tramples his crops is a 2ton cockroach 
zimbabwe takes a sensible if unsentimental approach in 
demanding that wildlife pay its own way with licensed trophy 
and meat harvesting local people are given their wildlife as 
manageable assets 
then theres south africas intensively managed kruger nation 
park a fenced area the size of massachusetts where as many as 
400 elephants usually old males are killed each year to keep 
the population in balance 
arctic wars and playing god with nature dont answer 
questions they pose them its our planet what shall we do with 
it 
 
elsewhere in television 
public tv audience still growing public television increased 
its audience by 9 percent in november its second straight month of 
audience growth in the fall season the public broadcasting service 
says 
novembers primetime rating was an average 24 up from 22 
during november 1989 octobers 23 rating was up 10 percent over 
the same period last year according to ac nielsen co figures 
pbs said 
a rating point equals 931000 tv households so pbs averaged 
nearly 25 million households tuned in thats minuscule compared 
with commercial tv ratings but sheer bliss to pbs executives and 
their audience 
pbs also reports its membersupport pledges are running 6 
percent over last decembers pledge period

if anyone can get robert redford back on the 
screen its sydney pollack and the talented pair combine again 
for a drama against the backdrop of the 1958 cuban revolution 
havana 
the film marks the seventh collaboration for the unlikely pair 
the outgoing jewish hoosier and the secretive goldenhaired 
california blond 
their previous movies this property is condemned three 
days of the condor jeremiah johnson the way we were 
the electric horseman out of africa the latter winning 
pollack the 1985 academy award for director 
pollack and redford met in 1961 when both were unknown actors 
working in denis sanders antiwar film war hunt pollack had 
aimed for an acting career ever since leaving lafayette ind at 
the age of 17 and enrolling at sandford meisners neighborhood 
playhouse in new york he appeared in several broadway plays 
including stalag 17 playing the role that won william holden 
an oscar in the film version 
after two years of army service he returned to new york then 
joined john frankenheimer as dialogue coach on the film the young 
savages that led to tv directing then his first feature the 
slender thread starring sidney poitier and anne bancroft in 
1965 
his other films have included they shoot horses dont they 
absence of malice and tootsie 
pollack 56 recently talked about his relationship with redford 
and other matters in an interview with the associated press here 
are the highlights 
q its been five years since out of africa why such a gap 
between films 
a i had often threatened to set up a production company so i 
went off and did it i had always heard people say it takes so long 
to get pictures done i found out it took me three years to set up 
the company mirage we did presumed innocent major league 
the fabulous baker boys and white palace 
i didnt start looking for my own project for at least a couple 
of years then i dug up havana which i had started working on in 
1976 i didnt take the time to hunt around i just remembered 
liking it and putting it away q what was so intriguing about 
that period in havana 
a mostly it was romanticism the most sensual place in the 
world in the 50s as corrupt as any place in the world there was 
this wonderful in terms of filmmaking week of christmas 1958 
when the guns were in the hills and the gambling was at a fever 
pitch the vividness of the colors and the sensuality was like 
catnip for a filmmaker 
q did you visit havana yourself 
a many times but they the us government just wouldnt let 
me shoot there as long as youre invited and you dont spend 
money you can go there youre just not allowed to spend money 
because thats called trading with the enemy since cuba is our 
enemy they wouldnt let me spend millions of stockholders money 
down there havana was recreated in the dominican republic at an 
extra cost of 12 million to 14 million 
q how did you persuade redford to abandon his causes and skiing 
and make another movie 
a well i bought a lot of good groceries because he likes to 
eat he knows i cook pretty well and i just waved the smells and 
got him in 
no i think he welcomed the challenge of stretching a bit its 
a sleazier lowerclass character than he usually plays this guys 
a little more vulnerable hes the person who does the pursuing 
instead of the one who lays back and is the object of pursuit hes 
roughed up a little bit with a tattoo hes got some mileage on 
him now all of that certainly was good for me and i think it was 
for him too 
q what about lena olin his costar 
a lena was one of the most impressive of the newer actresses i 
had seen i needed somebody i thought could knock the pins out from 
under redford and make him drive after her through a war even 
though she was rebuffing him also she had some substance beyond 
sexuality which is not uncommon among pretty women 
q after seven pictures with redford can you work in shorthand 
a its pretty minimal whats required now sometimes i dont 
even say anything if a take of his closeup is cut and i say one 
more i dont need to say more he just knows to try something 
different 
after seven pictures and 25 years it is a shorthand that 
doesnt mean that we dont get into fights and arguments and beefs 
and i dont sometimes have to push him like hell there are always 
areas that we disagree on but hes very good about trying things 
whether he agrees or not 
q how would you answer people who say havana is a 
procastro movie 
a its not procastro its antibatista the previous 
dictator if that means that de facto its procastro then i have 
to live with that its a movie thats saying quite clearly 
that there was a degree of corruption in 1958 by the batista 
government that every american acknowledged including the american 
government

car inspections will cost about 15 a 
year more gas stations will need vaporcatching pumps and more 
than 90 local companies from paper mills to hospitals will be 
required to pay up to 100000 annually under the nations tough 
new clean air law 
thats just some of the impact of the clean air act on portland 
the home of the laws chief architect senate majority leader 
george mitchell 
because portland like so many other cities struggles with an 
ozone problem and factory pollutants it serves as a good example 
of how the act will affect cities across the country 
while the environmental protection agency prepares regulations 
under the sweeping legislation state and local officials 
factories and businesses already are assessing the impact 
this is a very aggressive act said dennis keschl director 
of the bureau of air quality control in maines department of 
environmental protection there are a lot of interesting 
provisions and we havent found them all 
as in several towns and cities in maine the pungent smell of a 
paper mill a sharp odor not unlike cooking cabbage often wafts 
over the portland area 
the paper industry is just one of many that will be hit by the 
laws stricter enforcement measures regulations on releasing toxic 
chemicals and higher fees for state permits allowing them to 
pollute the air keschl said 
the new law authorizes states to begin charging factories and 
other polluters an annual fee of 25 for every ton of a pollutant 
they put into the atmosphere up to 4000 tons or a maximum of 
100000 keschl said 
in cumberland county alone he said 92 companies will have to 
pay some amount of the new fee from the sd warren paper mill in 
westbrook to maine medical center in portland 
remember theyre being charged per ton of pollutants so 
theres an incentive to reduce the amount they pollute keschl 
said 
mitchell a democrat who lives in portland when hes not in 
washington said the laws major effect on his hometown will be to 
reduce pollution from cars and trucks 
portland is one of more than 50 cities across the country where 
drivers will have to get their cars inspected to make sure 
pollution control devices work properly 
state officials estimate the requirement will increase the cost 
of a drivers annual safety inspection by 15 keschl said 
the new law also will require many gas stations in portland and 
other cities with an ozonepollution problem to install a new type 
of pump with a dualhose nozzle designed to keep vapors from 
escaping when a car is refueled 
this is important to reduce not only volatile organic 
compounds but human exposure to benzene which is a component of 
gasoline and is known to be a carcinogen in humans mitchell 
said 
gene guilford president of the maine oil dealers association 
estimated 100 service stations in the portland area would have to 
install the new pumps at a cost of 30000 per station 
ultimately i would guess that companies will try to pass on 
as much of the cost to the consumer as possible he said 
the changes wont have to be made for two to three years keschl 
noted the act gives the epa one year to write regulations for 
enforcing the law states then have two years to institute the 
regulations 
the law is so new so complex and so long the final 
legislation totaled more than 1100 pages that officials in maine 
and even washington arent certain of all its effects 
weve got lawyers struggling over it right now trying to 
figure it out said dave ryan an epa spokesman in washington 
its going to generate hundreds of regulations between now and 
the turn of the century 
the act imposes strict measures to combat acid rain smog and 
toxic industrial pollution and has generated stiff opposition from 
industries nationwide ryan said 
all ive been enduring for the past several weeks is 
criticism he said 
a major section takes aim at ozone the most pervasive air 
pollutant in maine its created by the chemical reaction that 
takes place when sunlight hits pollutants in the atmosphere 
a large part of the problem we face comes in from states 
upwind of us new jersey new york massachusetts keschl said 
under the law state environmental officials must work to ensure 
that ozone levels dont go higher than the federal limit of 12 
parts per million 
maine already has a stricter limit of 08 parts per million but 
portlands ozone levels are nearly double that at 156 ppm keschl 
said 
as a result ozone pollution in the portland metropolitan area 
is ranked moderate by the epa ryan the epa spokesman said 31 
other metro areas in the country have a moderate pollution ranking 
the portsmouthdoverrochester metropolitan area along the 
mainenew hampshire border has a serious rating the highest in 
maine keschl said fifteen other metro areas in the country have 
serious ratings eight have severe ratings and one los 
angeles is in a class by itself extreme ryan said 
the primary contributors to the creation of ozone are nitrogen 
oxides and volatile organic compounds both of which come from auto 
pollution 
the law also lists 189 pollutants considered toxic companies 
that release these chemicals are required to install the maximum 
available pollution control devices to reduce the emissions 
though environmental officials havent yet determined all of the 
laws effects mitchell said it definitely will improve the 
environment 
the end result we hope will be cleaner air he said

it must have been four or five times i shouted to marie are 
you all right but then suddenly her voice changed she sounded 
different she held my hand tightly and gripped me as hard as she 
could she said daddy i love you very much those were her 
exact words to me and those were the last words i ever heard her 
say gordon wilson

<TEXT>
when his 20yearold daughter was 
slain by a bomb gordon wilson stood out from the conflict between 
protestants and roman catholics in northern ireland by simply 
stating christian beliefs 
i bear no ill will i bear no grudge wilson said hours 
after an irish republican army bomb killed his daughter marie and 
10 of his neighbors three years ago in enniskillen 
its part of a greater plan and god is good wilson told a 
bbc reporter and we shall meet again 
wilsons message so unexpected where rage and vows of vengeance 
are commonplace provoked an extraordinary reaction queen 
elizabeth ii mentioned him in her christmas speech organizations 
pressed awards on him 
im not sure why what i said should have had the response that 
it did because to me what i said was said from the heart wilson 
said recently 
im now talking about forgiveness ive said the lords prayer 
all my life 
dont misunderstand me im not pretending that im a 
religious man im not but i do believe what i read when i see 
the words love god and love your neighbor thats what i was 
taught and thats what i have tried to live with all my life 
and i would have thought that was a perfectly normal and 
natural thing for a guy to say who himself believed forgive us 
our trespasses as we forgive those 
wilson reflects on his loss and his unwanted fame in a recently 
published book marie a story from enniskillen written with 
alf mccreary 
the slender book just 122 pages testifies to a deep vein of 
decency and compassion that thrives in northern ireland despite 
centuries of antagonism between protestants and catholics 
eleven people died in the enniskillen bombing on nov 8 1987 
and 63 were wounded one of the wounded school headmaster ronnie 
hill is still in a coma 
all the dead were protestants but wilson a methodist writes 
that the local catholic priest was the first to comfort him in the 
hospital 
when catholics held a memorial service wilson thought he should 
go and found he was not the only protestant there 
yet afterwards i took a bit of stick for going he wrote 
a minority of people felt that i had sold out my protestant 
heritage by going into a roman catholic church at all 
te bombing at enniskillen was especially shocking because the 
victims were attending the annual remembrance day ceremonies 
honoring the dead of the world wars 
it was the worst of the iras many mistakes and provoked a 
debate among the guerrillas supporters for a time there was hope 
that enniskillen would shock the ira into abandoning violence 
that hope faded as the gunmen of both sides claimed more 
victims a day before wilson met a reporter to talk about the book 
the ira kidnapped a catholic and forced him to drive a van filled 
with explosives into a military checkpoint he and four soldiers 
were killed 
wilson insists that hope survives perhaps because i dare not 
think otherwise 
he takes particular pride in the spirit of enniskillen 
program supported by the british government and the american fund 
for ireland which provides funds for young people to go abroad and 
gain a new perspective on their homeland 
i have met some great kids and that gives me hope said 
wilson who had stopped overnight in clarinbridge near galway in 
western ireland en route to a booksigning in limerick 
a tall skinny man with a direct gaze he has a manner of saying 
exactly what he means without qualification or evasion he speaks 
feelingly about his daughters death and also takes a businessmans 
interest in the details of book promotion 
politics he said he leaves to others 
it is a very fine line between on the one hand talking about 
reconciliation and tolerance and forgiveness and getting into 
politics and talking about religious denominations and 
differences he said 
you wouldnt believe the number of things i was asked to do 
thankfully i was able to say and i think wisely no thank 
you 
one rejected offer he said in the book was from a theatrical 
agent in new york who told a mutual friend does this guy wilson 
realize he is sitting on a million bucks 
wilson said he intended the book as a memorial to his daughter 
and as the story of one family caught in northern irelands 
violence but he also did it as therapy for himself 
he said his wife joan would be the first to say that i have 
been a different and a better man since the book was finished she 
would say im in better form with less sorrow in myself easier to 
live with perhaps too 
a friend warned him soon after the bombing that he would wonder 
why the tragedy had happened and advised him to be wary of 
answers 
i still ask why and i dont have the answer he said 
i do know that my 20yearold daughter died in a bomb in 
enniskillen with her whole life in front of her and a guy like 
me 60 years of age as i was then who had had a good innings as 
we say im still here 
and i dont think i have any right to ask why but i still do

prayer in school creches in front of government buildings and 
invocations at public ceremonies are out a television network 
promotes its most popular show with a scene mocking a family saying 
grace dear god we pay for all this stuff ourselves so thanks 
for nothing is bart simpsons punchline 
today government funds are used to support an art exhibition 
that includes a crucifix soaked in a jar of urine and united way 
funding is temporarily withdrawn from a boy scout chapter after 
objections to the scouts oath to do their duty to god and my 
country 
a generation of revolutionary change in the role of religion in 
public life has left many americans reeling and the nation 
struggling to find a common ethical ground to solve divisive moral 
issues such as abortion drugs homelessness poverty and the 
possibility of war 
for all kinds of good reasons we have systematically excluded 
the church from our public life now we discover that the voice of 
conscience which we always depended on the church is not 
present in the public debate said lisa newton a philosopher at 
fairfield university who wrote the study guide for the public 
broadcasting services 10part series on ethics in america 
so the question that confronts us now is given the 
constraints of the separation of church and state how do we 
reempower the churches 
only 39 percent of the respondents to a associated press poll 
conducted in november by icr survey research group said they 
believed religion is increasing its influence in american life in 
a 1985 gallup poll 49 percent said religion was increasing in 
influence and in 1957 a gallup poll indicated that more than 
twothirds thought religion was gaining power 
in 1986 after 12 years standing alone as the nations most 
trusted institution religion was replaced by the military as the 
institution in which americans have the most confidence according 
to another gallup poll 
but contrary to some expectations religious groups are not 
going quietly into that good night of a secular age 
bornagain christian evangelicals who burst onto the american 
political scene in the mid1970s have shown no sign of withdrawing 
and groups such as catholics jews black churches and now muslims 
alarmed by a rising tide of indifference to social ills from racism 
to drug abuse have entered into public policy debates in dramatic 
fashion 
as i travel around the country i find a lot of very 
reasonable rational people who feel under siege said gary 
bauer a former domestic policy adviser to ronald reagan who now is 
director of the family research council perhaps the most powerful 
evangelical lobbying group in the nation 
their perception is that theyre living in a hostile country 
that everything they believe in is under persistent attack 
when the pilgrims founded this country they could not have 
foreseen a culture that celebrates a crucifixadorned woman named 
madonna who capitalizes on religious imagery with songs such as the 
nonetoosubtle like a virgin and the title of her latest 
anthology the immaculate collection 
the purpose they declared in 1620 in the mayflower compact 
for ye glories of god and advancement of ye christian faith 
the public manifestations of religion at the core of american 
life stayed with society from the american revolution when all but 
one of the 13 states had a tax to support the preaching of the 
gospel to the 1950s when national values that mainline 
protestantism supplied were reinforced by billboards along the 
nations highways encouraging americans to go to church 
that was kind of a final burst of a dream of the protestant 
america where the churches continued to enjoy a great deal of 
influence and authority said dean thomas ogletree of yale 
divinity school 
while the percentage of catholics in america has jumped 40 
percent since 1947 the percentage of protestants declined 23 
percent 
within protestantism churches such as the southern baptist 
convention and the assemblies of god grew rapidly while the 
denominations that used to hold cultural sway such as the 
presbyterian and episcopal churches declined dramatically 
some sociologists expect islam to surpass judaism as the 
nations largest minority religion by the end of the century 
behind christianity 
judicial rulings keep pushing the walls separating religion and 
public life farther apart and an increasingly secular education 
system is shutting out any reference to religion said a james 
reichley a senior fellow at the brookings institution and author 
of religion in american public life 
at the same time reichley said society is getting more of its 
direction from other institutions such as television 
the actual influence of the churches and religion in shaping a 
public ethic is continuing to decline he said 
william mckinney dean of hartford seminary and coauthor of 
american mainline religion its changing shape and future uses 
baseball imagery to trace the changes 
the early protestant groups built the stadium and supplied the 
teams he said in the federal period in the late 18th century 
they were forced to admit other teams by the 1920s other teams 
had their own stadiums but mainline protestant churches still 
supplied the umpires 
whats happened in the last 30 years is the umpires are gone 
and nobody knows what the rules are mckinney said 
many religious leaders praise the new religious pluralism in a 
nation that has a history of religious bigotry represented by the 
period in the early 19th century when the nativist movement fueled 
the burning of catholic churches and convents and the virulent 
antisemitism in the latter part of the century in reaction to the 
rise in jewish immigration 
the difference today is that the various religious 
traditions get expressed and no one group has the power or will 
have the power to force its view on others mckinney said 
religious groups working in coalitions have enjoyed some 
political successes catholics and evangelicals have helped sustain 
the abortion issue and mainline protestant and catholic groups 
receive credit for focusing attention on human rights abuses and 
helping keep the nation out of direct military involvement in el 
salvador and nicaragua during the reagan years 
but some religious observers say the struggle of competing 
secular and religious voices has left society with no common 
language to mediate moral conflicts 
concern for the common good is giving way to just pure 
selfishness with an accompanying rise in ethnic and racial 
tensions including antisemitism reichley said 
what some now fear is that if religion is reduced to the 
periphery of american society ethical debates will be reduced to a 
darwininan struggle of special interest groups where power not 
morality rules 
political scientists dont want to talk about the good 
society but instead confine their discussion to analyses of 
voter preferences ogletree said

presiding bishop edmond browning couldnt get his phone calls 
returned when ronald reagan was president now with fellow 
episcopalian george bush in office browning considers himself a 
pastor to the president 
but while presidential access is improving for mainline 
protestants some disgruntled religious conservatives are slamming 
the white house door on their way out they contend bush took their 
votes and then pushed aside their concerns on abortion 
homosexuality and obscenity 
describing a meeting with bush in late october robert dugan 
public affairs director of the national association of 
evangelicals said we told him the truth that his 
administration is on the ropes with evangelicals 
welcome to the new world of religion and politics 
jerry falwell and pat robertson have stepped out of the 
political limelight mainline protestant churches see signs of a 
return to political influence and the catholic church may emerge 
as the most powerful religious power broker of all because of its 
willingness to enter into coalitions with a wide range of allies 
an associated press poll conducted in november by icr survey 
research group indicates americans believe that within some 
limits religious leaders have a responsibility to enter public 
policy debates 
threequarters of the poll respondents said religious leaders 
such as priests ministers and rabbis should speak out on social 
issues but 58 percent including 63 percent of the catholic 
respondents said the clergy should not endorse political 
candidates 
the emergence of issues such as abortion civil rights child 
care and federal funding of the arts into the forefront of national 
public policy debates has shown that no american religious group 
appears willing to give up the good fight 
perhaps the single most dramatic defeat of the forces of 
militant secularism in america is that almost 18 years after roe 
vs wade the abortion issue just hasnt gone away said richard 
neuhaus author of the naked public square and the director of 
the institute on religion and public life in new york 
in the new ballgame the ability to deliver votes not past 
status as the religious elite is what counts 
the heyday of mainline protestantism highlighted when president 
eisenhower laid the cornerstone for the new national council of 
churches building in new york in 1958 declined two years later 
coinciding with the election of the countrys first catholic 
president john kennedy 
bornagain christian evangelicals jolted from political apathy 
by judicial rulings eliminating school prayer and legalizing 
abortion entered the fray 
leaders such as falwell and robertson helped mobilize voter 
registration drives that drew millions into the political process 
and contributed heavily to reagans two presidential victories in 
1988 dugan said bush received 82 percent of the white evangelical 
vote his largest single voting bloc 
but as robertson and falwell left the political spotlight to 
concentrate on less earthly matters some say evangelicals 
influence has waned 
the well is dry for now said barry lynn legislative 
director of the american civil liberties union a frequent opponent 
of religious conservatives on churchstate issues 
others including university of chicago historian martin marty 
say the superstars such as falwell and robertson have been 
replaced by new leaders like radio psychologist and author james 
dobson whose family research council has chapters in 17 states 
lobbying on issues such as abortion home schooling and 
pornography 
the arrest of a florida record store owner and two 2 live crew 
members grew from a focus on the family mailing containing the 
lyrics of the groups explicit rap album as nasty as they wanna 
be 
upset with the republican partys apparent wavering on its 
antiabortion stance and the lack of concern expressed by bush over 
the national endowments for the arts controversy evangelicals may 
be looking for new political partners 
if the president and the party dont wake up they face the 
possibility of a third party in 1992 that would end up giving the 
white house to the democrats said gary bauer a former domestic 
policy adviser under reagan who now oversees the family research 
council these people are up for grabs in a major way 
mainline churches have shown their political influence by 
helping focus attention on human rights abuses in el salvador and 
working for congressional passage of the civil rights restoration 
act said browning the episcopal bishop 
but other observers say those churches are hurt by their 
inability to mobilize grassroots support among their 
congregations 
alan d hertzke the author of representing god in 
washington said liberal churches have been effective in lobbying 
for funds for hunger relief and in limiting aid to the nicaraguan 
contras but that some members of congress discount their influence 
theres pretty good evidence that most church members have no 
knowledge of what their national church leaders are doing said 
hertzke a professor at the university of oklahoma 
despite its absolute theological stance on many issues the 
catholic church has proven to be one of the most effective 
religious players in the game of practical politics hertzke said 
for example he said catholics took the lead among religious 
groups in the abortion debate in pennsylvania and forsook an 
allornothing approach to work successfully for a law 
requiring a waiting period for the womans husband to be notified 
and for parental consent to be required for minors 
catholic lobbyists also helped open the door for aid to 
parochial schools by working for a child care bill that allows 
churchrun day care centers to be eligible for federal subsidies 
but what may hurt the churchs sway some observers say are 
highprofile disciplinary actions such as the banning of one 
legislator from the communion rail and threatening others with 
eternal damnation for their abortionrights stands 
demoralization within the church over the clergy shortage and 
internal liberalconservative tensions also limit its influence 
said marty the university of chicago historian 
theyre power brokers but theyre not all that powerful 
theyre divided he said 
as the nation prepares for the possibility of war in the middle 
east james childress a university of virginia professor and 
author of moral responsibility in conflicts is among those who 
fear religious groups arent doing enough to hold the nation 
accountable to its justwar tradition requiring war to be 
justified in moral rather than economic terms 
theres been fairly ready acceptance of the definition of our 
national interest in this setting childress said 
if america enters a war with iraq childress said it appears a 
majority of religious groups would support the administration 
others say that would be a serious miscalculation 
the national council of churches has urged the administration to 
halt its military buildup in the persian gulf and begin withdrawing 
troops and the national conference of catholic bishops has 
repeatedly expressed reservations about the possibility of a us 
offensive 
we ignore the religious element to our peril said bishop 
herbert chilstrom spiritual leader of the evangelical lutheran 
church in america there is a profound sense of religious belief 
in our people

liberalconservative barricades within the

third installment of a fourpart series unholy wars religion in

</TEXT>

religion in america was simpler in the 1950s 
the phrase under god was added to the pledge of allegiance 
catholics evangelicals jews and muslims kept a low profile and a 
pecking order helped a communitys most prominent citizens 
gravitate toward mainline protestant institutions such as the 
presbyterian and episcopal churches 
but then a series of sociological changes shook nearly 3 
centuries of protestant hegemony ranging from the rapid rise of 
evangelicalism to the surge of catholics to equal protestants in 
income and education to judicial rulings limiting the influence of 
religion in public life 
in explaining what happened in his midwest community one 
mainline protestant executive told hartford seminary dean william 
mckinney you have to understand the neighborhood changed when 
the whites moved out and the irish catholics moved in 
the demographic shifts have not led to a passive changing of the 
guard but to what some observers see as increasingly bitter 
divisions between liberals and conservatives that threaten 
religions traditional role of supplying society with a common set 
of moral standards 
religious people have got to get their act together said 
dean thomas ogletree of yale divinity school if were unable to 
talk to one another because were so divided the larger society is 
wise to say lets keep religion out of it because theyll just 
mess it up 
in a 1984 gallup poll 31 percent of religious conservatives 
held negative stereotypes of religious liberals while only 7 
percent found similar faults with themselves the range of 
intolerance was even greater on the religious left where 41 
percent held negative views of conservatives while only 3 percent 
said liberal sterotypes were valid 
the division is at least as strong if not stronger than it 
was five years ago said robert wuthnow a princeton university 
sociology professor who has studied the issue 
america may be heralded as a haven for religious freedom but it 
also has a history of religious bigotry 
at the founding of the country most states had laws 
discriminating against catholics and formally establishing either 
anglican or congregational churches 
strong anticatholic and antisemitic attitudes existed into the 
1950s despite a veneer of placid tolerance epitomized by president 
eisenhowers declaration that our government makes no sense 
unless it is founded on a deeply felt religious faith and i dont 
care what it is 
but the 60s and 70s saw unprecedented ecumenical advances 
fueled by such things as a broad range of religious groups working 
together on the civil rights movement pope john xxiii opening the 
windows of the catholic church to the world with the second vatican 
council and a series of theological statements from christian 
groups apologizing for their past antisemitism 
i think if you look at any long time line the trend is only 
up said jacqueline wexler president of the national conference 
of christians and jews 
but many observers say the resurgence of catholics and 
bornagain christian evangelicals into the public arena has brought 
about a renewal of religious prejudice 
thirty percent of the respondents in a gallup survey last year 
said they would not welcome religious fundamentalists as neighbors 
by comparison only 5 percent said they would not welcome 
protestants in general or jews 
at a reformation day service in october at yale divinity school 
lutheran theologian george lindbeck lamented that anticatholicism 
has become in some corners the antisemitism of intellectuals 
mckinney who is studying mainline protestant executives and who 
authored american mainline religion its changing shape and 
future agreed 
i think anticatholicism is the last respectable american 
prejudice he said 
the liberalconservative barricades cross denominational lines 
many religious conservatives who tend to emphasize spirituality 
prayer and bible study over social concerns have begun to form 
their own organizations within mainline churches the good news 
movement in the united methodist church the presbyterian lay 
committee and the episcopal synod of america are examples 
in more conservative denominations such as the southern baptist 
convention those who favor greater acceptance of divergent 
theological views also have formed their own lobbying groups such 
as the southern baptist alliance 
but the liberalconservative divide may not be as wide as each 
side might think 
wuthnow said his research indicates conservatives are more 
tolerant and socially concerned than liberals think they are some 
conservative churches for example have established programs to 
help the homeless and counsel the unemployed 
in the brookings institution study religion in american public 
life a james reichley said many religious conservatives 
approach the abortion struggle with the same ardor liberals fought 
for civil rights 
on the issue of abortion they believe it is the liberals who 
are countenancing mass destruction of potential life while 
fundamentalists in alliance with catholics stand up for the most 
vulnerable of all forms of human life the unborn reichley 
said 
at the same time wuthnow said liberals are more devout in 
their faith than conservatives think they are as shown by a 
renewed interest in evangelism and bible study 
bishop herbert w chilstrom spiritual leader of the evangelical 
lutheran church in america said more than 9000 of the 
denominations 11000 congregations ordered tapes of a 
churchsponsored faithdevelopment program 
thats indicative of a very deep hunger for faith development 
among our people he said 
and partnerships are being fostered for the first time in a 
generation religious groups across the board now are forming 
coalitions on issues ranging from apartheid to pornography 
many religious leaders have a sense of being in the same boat 
they sense as they once did not the danger of religion being 
ttally driven out of a public role in society reichley said 
pressure has grown in recent years to consider issues ranging 
from abortion to nuclear war on secular grounds as more people 
view religion as a set of divisive sectarian interests wuthnow 
said 
when you take out the moral values supplied by religion he 
said then what becomes important are issues of economics 
political expediency practicality 
those are the wrong guidelines to use for deciding issues such 
as euthanasia genetic engineering allocation of limited health 
care resources and even whether the nation should go to war 
wuthnow and others said 
in the new religious climate the ability to compromise is seen 
as a high moral value said ogletree of yale divinity school 
the alternative to compromise is moral anarchy or religious 
conflict he said

end to what they call exploitation growers say the pickers 
allegations unfairly tarnish all of them for the transgressions of 
a few 
but recent federal investigations support the complaints of the 
pickers who disrupted this years multimilliondollar harvest with 
protests strikes and demonstrations over substandard living 
conditions and povertylevel wages 
a backyard garden vegetable 15 years ago chile peppers now are 
new mexicos largest cash food crop and the state is the nations 
largest chile producer and exporter last years crop was valued at 
nearly 42 million 
but some workers who won legal status through a 1986 
immigration amnesty program say they havent shared in the 
prosperity 
they think its a lot of money theyre paying us said jesus 
vasquez of ciudad juarez mexico who has been living beneath the 
bridge since may but its not enough 
carlos marentes director of the union de trabajadores agricolas 
fronterrizas the border agricultural workers union said farm 
workers earn an average of 6000 for a family of seven 12000 
less than the federal poverty line 
although federal law requires farmers to pay laborers the 
minimum wage of 380 an hour pickers are being paid the same 
rates for a bucket of peppers as they were a decade ago he said 
meanwhile the size of the bucket has gone from 6 gallons to 10 
gallons 
farmers pay by the bucket picked an average 60 cents to 70 
cents even if a worker does not pick enough buckets to earn 
3040 the minimum wage for an eighthour day farmers or labor 
contractors are required by law to pay the hourly wage anyway 
union organizers and some pickers say farmers arent complying 
i have a wage receipt from a lady who worked eight hours 
and they have four hours on her work receipt she made 21 said 
sandy newlopez a union staff member 
i think what they want is they want the undocumented workers 
they had before 1986 that would stay in the field all day and pick 
for a few cents a bucket marentes said 
farmers believe the union has exaggerated the problems of a 
minority of workers 
i think they bring up isolated incidents said don hackey 
chairman of the new mexico chile commission which represents many 
of the states estimated 400 chile growers they find something 
thats happened to an individual and then portray it as widespread 
and say thats how we all work thats absolutely not true 
hackey said he pays 100 to 150 workers picking his 300 acres as 
much as 80 cents a bucket his own survey of workers on his field 
found the average wage was 54 for about eight hours work 
the only complaint i hear from my people is gosh i wish we 
had this all year hackey said 
us labor department investigators sent out in august found 63 
cases of violations of various federal laws said andy chavez 
district director of the albuquerque wage and hour division of the 
labor department 
a second investigation of 51 growers and farm labor contractors 
that ended in october found 142 violations only six of the 51 were 
in compliance with laws protecting farm workers many of whom say 
they were better off before they were granted amnesty 
i thought it would be a lot better now that i am legal said 
jose cadena 25 who was trying to sleep one night in a pickup 
truck parked beneath an interstate bridge but now its a lot 
worse they used to give housing to the illegal aliens and food 
now we have to pay for our own 
tierra del sol a nonprofit group that provides housing for 
farm workers estimated about 17000 work in southern new mexico 
among them are permanent laborers who live in the towns where they 
work migratory workers who follow the crops and a commuter 
population that comes from juarez and is recruited in el paso 
texas about 90 miles from hatch 
on the same night cadena was sleeping his camper a few workers 
huddled beneath flimsy blankets on an el paso street trying to get 
a little sleep many workers sought shelter inside parked buses 
others paced the street to stay awake 
most of those workers can be found in predawn hours at the foot 
of the paso del norte bridge in downtown el paso waiting for labor 
contractors who will hire them for another days work 
gregorio lopez 33 said he usually arrives at the bridge about 
1 am after catching a 10 pm bus from his home in juarez the 
buses usually return him from the fields at about 6 pm or 7 pm 
all i have a chance to do is shower and eat and come back 
he said i sleep on the bus i get about 1 hours sleep 
lopez said he didnt like to sleep on the street because workers 
who do often awake to find their shoes jacket or money stolen 
more and more people are sleeping out on the street theyre 
not street people they are farm laborers said bill belt 
regional administrator of the us department of labor wage and 
hour division these are good hardworking people 
unfortunately they are caught in a bad situation 
grower eliseo flores believes the producers are the ones with 
the problems 
we need some real help what we got is a bunch of dadgum trash 
that litter the town and litter the fields we were better off with 
wets undocumented workers said flores who farms 200 acres 
these people they go to the bathroom 20 times a day or they go 
in the fields we got a bunch of winos and drug addicts 
flores said hes been forced to knock down houses he set up for 
workers because the structures were vandalized and didnt meet 
federal standards 
hackey the chile commission chairman said farmers already pay 
taxes and shouldnt have to subsidize housing for workers 
instead he said the commission supports tierra del sol which 
has built an apartment complex for laborers in hatch and is trying 
to build another in anthony on the texasnew mexico state line 
no one is really at fault for their situation said rose 
garcia tierra del sols executive director unfortunately 
because they are farm workers they are the working homeless

some scrooges say its those little red and green things 
that make them think youd have to be nuttier than a fruitcake to 
eat one others drag out the joke you know the one about there 
being just one fruitcake that gets passed around and around and 
around 
its the only thing that everybody doesnt like except 
lutefisk the humorist calvin trillin says referring to a 
norwegian dried cod dish 
but have you ever eaten fruitcake mr trillin 
i think i had a bite once 20 years ago it was before i knew 
i was an innocent he says probably it was christmas the fire 
was going the presents were being unwrapped or maybe they already 
were unwrapped 
fruitcake has had its share of humiliation johnny carson and 
columnist russell baker have poked fun nearly a third of the 
people surveyed by american express a couple of years back said it 
was the worst gift of all 
well mr trillin mr baker and all you other naysayers enough 
already 
its sort of an annual plague said susan purdy author of 
the cookbook a piece of cake who argues theres more to 
fruitcake than men of this ilk know 
im not going to sit here and tell you that when you hear a 
fruitcake joke it doesnt make you kind of mad it does said w 
dale parker a vice president at the granddaddy of fruitcake 
bakers claxton bakery inc in claxton ga 
parkers family business bakes 5 million pounds of fruitcake a 
year 
obviously theres a lot of people out there eating 
fruitcake parker said 
we get some rave reviews that its just like the one 
grandmother wanted to bake but couldnt boasts father andrew of 
the holy cross abbey in berryville va where each year the 
monastery bakery turns out 13000 traditional fruit and 
nutstudded cakes laced with brandy 
so mr trillin how do you suppose these companies stay in 
business 
people are buying them and theyre giving them to other 
people but that doesnt mean theyre eating them he said 
ive been given a lot of fruitcakes as gifts 
richard sullivan of the glace fruit processors admits some 
fruitcakes taste like sawdust his father always got one for 
christmas that was dense and bitter i never liked the thing 
ah but then there are good ones 
they have to have wonderful fruits said purdy who uses 
mangoes papayas apricots dates nuts dried apples pears and 
plums she advises avoid little red and green and yellow 
things 
a good fruitcake to me is like eating candy sullivan said 
i just love it 
melvin gordon president of paradise fruit inc in plant city 
fla said he doesnt know how fruitcake got such a lousy 
reputation 
he notes that his industry sells 50 million pounds of candied 
fruit a year and if he could talk to mr trillin hed say 
fruitcake has been around a lot longer than you and i 
even some particular fruitcakes can claim that 
in enoughs enough a new collection of trillins columns 
he mentions a family in michigan that brings out an antique 
fruitcake every christmas a fruitcake that for some reason was not 
eaten at christmas dinner in 1895 and has symbolized the holidays 
ever since 
mr trillin meet morgan ford of tecumseh mich keeper of a 
cake baked not in 1895 he says but in 1878 by his 
greatgrandmother 
when she died early the following year the cake was forgotten 
for a while today its in an airtight glass box ford said 
theres a musty rum smell there yet he said 
when his uncle then 86 took a bite a couple decades back ford 
said he had to cut it off with his jacknife sliver it off it 
doesnt look too appetizing to me 
as if to ward off the inevitable ford notes right away that his 
uncle lived two more years 
if i make it to 86 and im 70 ill taste it then he 
said 
but he could be persuaded to give into temptation by johnny 
carson who has poked fun at the cake if hed take a bite 
ford said id take a bite 
go ahead mr trillin joke about heirloom or antique 
fruitcakes age can be a virtue 
the late james beard often called the dean of american food 
once wrote that his mother baked fruitcakes a full year ahead and 
kept some of her wedding fruitcake for a quartercentury by 
periodically lacing it with cognac 
the ancient romans purdy said baked fruitcakes called 
satura latin for a full dish and the root of the word 
satire perhaps the romans had one up on you mr trillin 
martha washington made one for family holidays before 
refrigeration the sugar and spirits in fruitcakes acted as 
preservatives 
as recently as 50 years ago no one chortled over fruitcake 
our taste has changed we dont like things that are too 
heavy too sweet purdy said were talking about an antique 
cake in contemporary life and its trying to make the 
transition 
so go ahead take your potshots mr trillin and co but 
honestly wouldnt you be in a holiday funk if nobody at all 
remembered you with a fruitcake 
 
editors note mary macvean comes from a long line of fruitcake 
lovers and nevers lets a december go by without eating or baking 
some with or without the little red and green fruit

there are december nights when beverly nyberg 
who works all day looks up from frosting ginger cookies and finds 
its 3 am 
its a mad rush thats the essence of christmas cookies 
said nyberg a commercial artist at a new york advertising agency 
why do it then for tradition for love she said her 
mother now nearly 80 used to make at least 30 kinds of christmas 
cookies nybergs 20yearold son already is asking what kinds mom 
is making this year 
her favorites are thumbprints a sugar cookie covered with nuts 
and rolled in a ball a thumb stuck in the middle before baking 
leaves a depression just right for frosting or jam 
throughout december cooks everywhere take out traditional and 
newfound recipes baking nights and weekends to fill old shoe 
boxes or tins with cookies carefully layered with wax paper to 
freeze until christmas 
yeah your body complains from the effort nyberg said but 
the payoff is the enjoyment that everyone is walking by and 
grabbing cookies off the plate when it comes to the dday of 
christmas 
food historian william woys weaver of devon pa said he tries 
new cookies each year but always returns to old favorites such as 
a german cookie called chocolate apeas 
i made some for some children last week and a little girl 
said these even taste like christmas i said good good 
thats just what i want to hear weaver said 
nothing represents the spirit of loving nurturing and giving 
more than a homemade cookie rose levy beranbaum writes in her 
new book roses christmas cookies 
theyre always exactly the right size they look so appealing 
they taste so delicious theyre satisfying but not too filling 
judy knipe and barbara marks write in the christmas cookie 
book 
in many homes the morning before christmas the shoe boxes and 
cookie tins come out and gift baskets are arranged for delivery 
later that day little hands take delight in decorating cutout 
sugar cookies with sprinkles and red hots some to be left that 
night for santa claus 
marks will make eight or 10 kinds of cookies this year 
including ginger pecan slices chocolate orange chunk cookies and 
lemon drops carrying on a tradition learned at the elbow of her 
mother and other relatives especially her dads aunt marie 
i would get so exicted and a month before christmas i would 
go over on saturdays and bake with her marks said getting to 
go somewhere all by yourself at 7 or 8 was really something 
much of the year home baking is something of a lost art the 
nestle toll house kitchen in purchase ny cites studies showing 
tht only 35 percent of the baked goods eaten last year were made 
at home but nearly all the people surveyed said they bake for the 
holidays nestle said 
cookie comes from the dutch koekje the diminutive for 
cake but cookies are easier to make and more forgiving of the 
novices mistakes than cakes beranbaum said 
americans have always loved christmas cookies weaver said 
colonists could afford sweets only for special occasions and while 
christmas cookies in the shapes of animals and people were made for 
children they appealed to everyone he said 
it was a release a fantasy food in a sense the adult 
whos making camels and what have you i think theyre going back 
to childhood a little dont you weaver said of course they 
taste very good too 
among the earliest cookies were gingerbread which came both 
from germany and from england and scotland weaver writes in the 
christmas cook 
by the late 19th century refined sugar eggs and flour were 
available to most people and the castiron stove gave homemakers 
more control over baking than they had at the hearth he said 
that combined with a wave of immigration broadened the home 
cooks repertoire which now includes cookies from much of the 
world he said 
in her greenwich village apartment beranbaum shows off what 
look like stained glass windows sugar cookies with intricate 
cutouts filled with crushed sour balls that become translucent 
when baked she also bakes exquisite delicate snowflakes that 
sparkle when hung from the branches of a lighted tree 
beranbaums book has traditional elegant cookies downhome 
green wreaths made with marshmallows and cornflakes even brownies 
in the christmas cookie book the sharing is evident from the 
many recipes with a name attached amys molasses puffs renatas 
vanilla crescents hollys ginger crisps 
when beranbaum worked in the test kitchen of the ladies home 
journal her first story was on cookies for the christmas of 1975 
but christmas has long been part of this jewish new yorkers life 
i grew up with the feeling that in new york chistmas was a 
joyous cultural celebration belonging to everyone and not 
restricted only to those who observed it as a religious holiday 
she writes 
because of her book beranbaum doesnt have time to bake cookies 
for family and friends this year but she likes one way of 
considering her situation 
give a gift of christmas cookies and you spruce up one holiday 
give a book that teaches how to bake them and you feed christmases 
forever

perhaps its a sign of better times in 
tough old glasgow that this years biggest uproar was about the 
past 
critics attacked an exhibition about the citys 800 years which 
stressed its relations with the world for sanitizing history 
glasgows glasgow as it was called closed nov 5 and was the 
citys biggest attraction in 50 years drawing half a million 
visitors the show may have lost more than 8 million in a 30week 
run which the city will have to cover 
city hall will announce the cost in february when it presents 
the entire bill for the citys year as the european capital of 
culture 
the exhibition promoted as everything glasgow gave to the 
world and more was the centerpiece of the yearlong festival 
celebrating the title bestowed by culture ministers of the 
12nation european community athens florence amsterdam berlin 
and paris were chosen in earlier years 
jill campbell mackay public relations director for the cultural 
year said the title glasgows glasgow meant how the city 
perceived itself as perceived by the outside world 
under 22 arches of storage space below the central railway 
station unused for 60 years the show assembled 3200 artifacts of 
history industry and social life 
they ranged from a model of the yacht shamrock v with which 
glasgow grocery tycoon sir thomas lipton made five unsuccessful 
tries for the americas cup to the suitcase of an emigrant who 
paid 2 pounds then 10 for passage to canada in the 1920s 
documentary films lauded glasgows greatness as the second city 
of the british empire an industrial cornucopia that poured out 
textiles locomotives weapons and by 1913 about 60 percent of 
the worlds ships 
i think the exhibition was a great success said robert 
palmer director of the cultural year a space which was dripping 
wet unusable and derelict was renovated and that space and the 
new arches theater there seem certain to become a permanent part of 
the citys life 
an unusual partnership of business and a socialist council 
budgeted 50 million pounds 80 million when the year began to 
make cultural capital 1990 a success about 7 million went for 
glasgows glasgow 
commercial sponsors contributed cash materials and assistance 
valued at about 12 million 
us ambassador henry e catto visited the show june 20 and 
called it the most imaginative exhibition of its kind i have ever 
seen 
sniper fire was aimed at it regularly however by the daily 
glasgow herald and workers city a group of leftwing and 
anarchist writers poets folk musicians and workers the 60 or so 
active workers city members champion the class struggle against 
what they regard as glasgows yuppie ascendancy 
glasgow is renowned for fierce partisanship alone among british 
cities it is regarded as having come close to revolution in 
1919 during a general strike 
the red flag was raised in george square when 20000 
demonstrators demanded a 40hour work week while the sheriff read 
them the riot act ordering them to disperse a bottle hit him on 
the head forty people were seriously injured when horse and foot 
police charged the crowd 
a photograph of tanks and troops assembled at the cattle market 
was part of glasgows glasgow 
although unemployment remains above 14 percent the cultural 
capital designation recognized glasgows selfregeneration from 
industrial blight slums ill health and violence to a humming 
center of commerce tourism and the arts 
the poor have been moved out of the city center and their 
tenements demolished but to workers city they are no better off 
in the bleak damp tower blocks erected for them on glasgows 
periphery 
we have been accused of being propoverty but it isnt 
true said brendan mclaughlin owner of the scotia bar where 
workers city meets 
in the interests of privatizing glasgow and presenting it as a 
place without problems the glasgows glasgow exhibition buries our 
history of industrial struggle 
john murray the shows marketing executive said we had the 
slums the drink the gambling the crime the sickness and death 
alongside the shipyards the factories the scientists and the new 
industries 
in hopes of making a profit glasgow district council set an 
admission charge of 4 pounds then 650 when the show opened in 
april 
after public and press criticism the price was reduced in july 
to a pound about 160 total attendance was 501105 largest for 
such a show in glasgow since the empire exhibition of 1938 
attracted 12 million visitors from around the world that one lost 
money too 
no exhibition makes money but the cost of subsidizing 
glasgows glasgow was only half the cost of others in europe 
said doug clelland the architect who devised it 
clelland is proud of the exhibitions appeal we did three 
exit surveys and found 30 percent of the people visiting it had 
never before set foot in a museum or gallery he said

aryeh levin doesnt quite know what his title is 
israeli consul general israeli envoy 
im the head of a diplomats group he said chuckling 
with the questionable title of ambassador 
two years after his arrival and two months after the soviet 
union said it would end its 23year diplomatic rift with israel 
levin still waits to raise his countrys whiteandblue flag at an 
embassy in central moscow 
the kremlin has said bureaucratic problems are delaying full 
consular ties levin blamed the demon of antisemitism which 
he said pervades certain ministries and nearly reaches the top 
levels of government 
its a perception that looms large for israel and soviet jews 
both hope to cultivate a deeper jewish presence in the soviet union 
even as tens of thousands of jews emigrate 
we need a developed jewish life said leonid stonov a 
prominent jewish activist we need to increase jewish dignity 
israeli officials and soviet jewish leaders said emigration no 
longer defines their attitude toward the soviet union as it did 
during much of the cold war cultural and religious expression for 
jews and trade and social exchanges for israel now are nearly 
equal to emigration on their list of priorities 
more than 130000 soviet jews have emigrated this year to 
israel driven in part by increasing antisemitism several 
thousand more have gone to the united states about 300000 soviet 
emigres already live in israel 
of the 14 million jews still in the soviet union about 250000 
live in moscow 
jews who remain can celebrate their holidays openly and attend 
hebrew schools in major cities a new law on religion guarantees 
the right to such practices many of which formerly were 
prohibited 
groups have emerged to promote everything from zionism to jewish 
theater last december 250 such groups formed the confederation of 
soviet jewish organizations to protect jews and coordinate their 
activities 
our goal is to secure the survival of soviet jewry as part of 
world jewry said mikhail chlenov a cochairman of the 
organization 
antisemitism remains an obstacle for decades the kremlin 
painted israel as a racist state bent on taking arab land 
in the realm of foreign affairs where the general new 
thinking is like a stream there are little eddies on the side of 
this larger current levin said these little eddies are the 
antiisraeli attitude the concept of a world zionist conspiracy 
he said those attitudes had delayed restoration of full consular 
ties which would allow israel itself to issue visas to the 
hundreds of jews who want to leave the dutch embassy now 
represents israel in the soviet union and issues the visas 
israel and the kremlin agreed sept 30 after three years of 
warming relations to upgrade the delegations in each others 
capitals 
during that period levin arrived in moscow and his delegation 
moved back into the building it occupied before ties were severed 
over the 1967 arabisraeli war 
despite the announcement the state of relations has not 
changed a soviet foreign ministry spokesman blamed slowmoving 
bureaucracy 
levin said ranking soviet officials told him privately they must 
proceed slowly because of an antisemitic mood 
theyre using it as an excuse and they are at the same time 
suffering from it levin said 
he expressed optimism that full diplomatic relations could be 
restored within a year unless antiisraeli and antisemitic 
elements prevail levin said 
they all have their own pavlov reactions to anything that has 
to do with israel he said they have to get rid of this and 
im glad to say they are thinking along these lines but it will 
take time 
people who deal with israel today in the ministry of foreign 
affairs are not hebraists theyre arabists this does not explain 
everything but it goes a long way to explain a few things 
vladimir nosenko a middle east analyst at the institute of 
world economics and international relations echoed that view 
they have an old perception about the role of israel in the 
middle east and im afraid our bureaucracy is very strong he 
said our antizionist propaganda several years ago created the 
basic antisemitic problems we have now 
israel hopes diplomatic ties will increase trade and cultural 
contacts levin said 
nosenko said the soviet union needs israels agricultural 
knowhow the two countries have exchanged visits by farming 
experts and levin said israels agriculture minister would travel 
to the soviet union soon 
the confederation of jewish groups is working to open synagogues 
and may run candidates for the soviet parliament said chlenov the 
cochairman 
there is a feeling that jews were sitting in the far corner of 
a big room and only now theyre trying to come out into the 
center he said

more than a year ago president bush and the 
nations governors asked us to imagine an america with drugfree 
schools few dropouts no illiterates and worldclass science and 
math students 
more than that they promised to put education at the top of the 
national agenda 
this firstever education summit took place sept 2728 
1989 and set the stage for ambitious national goals and a 
hopedfor revival of us public education by the year 2000 
the goals were fleshed out in february by the national 
governors association and bush who promised to be an education 
president 
by the year 2000 he and the governors vowed 
all children will start school healthy wellfed and ready 
to learn the high school graduation rate will increase to at 
least 90 percent 
students will demonstrate competency in english mathematics 
science history and geography at various grade levels 
us students will be first in the world in mathematics and 
science achievement 
every adult will be literate and possess the knowledge and 
skills necessary to compete in a global economy 
every school will be free of drugs and violence and will 
offer a disciplined environment conducive to learning 
a year later with war possible in the mideast a recession 
looming and federal and state budgets in crisis does anyone still 
remember 
people are really becoming aware of our education deficit and 
really want to do something about it us education secretary 
lauro f cavazos insisted in an interview i guarantee you that 
cavazos and the president are not going to let the country forget 
it 
discussion in the year since the summit has been dominated by 
how to assess educational progress if standardized tests which 
ones should progress be measured state by state or should states 
be measured against independent yardsticks 
on wednesday a 14member national education goals panel 
consisting of six governors four highranking bush administration 
officials and four congressional leaders plan to meet in washington 
to explore the assessment question 
the panel led by colorado gov roy romer will try to decide on 
a format for a statebystate report card in time for the 
second anniversary of the summit 
romer said his group has opted for thoroughness over speed 
we have not been willing to deal with it on a surface 
kneejerk basis weve been examining whether our current methods 
including standardized tests tell us what we want to know 
but besides assessment some fear precious time has been lost in 
a politically charged debate over whether money is the key to 
reform or restructuring schools or perhaps as the bush 
administration insists giving parents tax breaks to choose any 
school they wish 
cavazos is among those who argues that schools wont get far 
unless principals teachers and parents get more authority and 
autonomy 
if we do not bring about restructuring then its going to be 
very difficult to reach those goals he said 
but if reaching them depends on changing classroom habits formed 
over a century reform will be a long long haul 
many teachers principals and school superintendents still 
regard restructuring as a threat to their authority or to 
longcherished habits 
a month ago for example teachers in rochester ny rejected 
a trailblazing contract that included many such reform features 
even though top pay would have risen beyond 80000 
i think within the education establishment there has been 
skepticism over whether these goals are realizable or believable 
said ernest l boyer president of the carnegie foundation for the 
advancement of teaching among group practitioners theres not 
much realization that goals mean anything to them 
some believe drugfree schools may prove the most reachable of 
the six goals drugs remain a serious problem at home and in the 
streets but substance abuse appears to be on the wane within many 
schools 
i think we have done a very creditable job of getting it out 
of our schools i dont mean to be a pollyanna but that is 
probably the most attainable goal said timothy dyer executive 
director of the national association of secondary school 
principals 
at the opposite extreme its hard to find anyone who believes 
us students will soar from last place to first internationally in 
math and science skills by the year 2000 certainly not without 
herculean shifts in local school district priorities and 
significant new investments in teacher training 
i think that to have such a goal is laudable but to say that 
it would happen within this decade is a bit ambitious said iris 
carl president of the national council of teachers of mathematics 
i dont think its achievable because we are victims of a 
mathanxious society adults boast that they didnt do well in 
math she said 
skeptics add that it may also be a long struggle just to agree 
on definitions for problems like illiteracy or dropout 
much less solve them 
if dropout means all adults who lack a high school degree or 
the equivalent the national rate is only about 12 percent and the 
goal of 10 percent is just around the corner 
but if dropout means all 9thgraders who fail to graduate in 
four years the rate stands at 27 percent 
romer said he hopes his panel can arrive at a working definition 
in the next month or so it remains to be seen whether he can get 
politicians and more than 15000 school districts to agree to it 
hopes for defining illiteracy meanwhile center on the national 
assessment of educational progress a princeton nj testing body 
that is planning to assess the skills of 20000 to 30000 adults 
results are due in january 1993 and should provide the first 
meaningful benchmark for measuring adult literacy 
i think frankly weve lost some time over the past year over 
the politics of how to implement the goals said boyer of the 
carnegie foundation for the advancement of teaching 
the real questions are how do we move toward the goals and 
assess the progress its high time we decided whos in charge

a 101 billion privatization of britains 
electricity industry was a huge success the government said with 
britons seeking more than 10 times the number of shares being 
offered 
demand from the public was so strong in fact that it triggered 
a clawback mechanism that scaled back the amount of shares 
reserved for both foreign investors and domestic institutional 
investors said kleinwort benson ltd the governments financial 
advisor 
kleinwort said monday the offer was 107 times oversubscribed by 
the general public 
under the offering the government sold a total 216 billion 
shares in the 12 electricity distributing companies of england and 
wales the shares sold for 240 pence or 468 each for a total 
518 billion pounds 101 billion 
the government plans to sell its two electricity generating 
companies and the scottish electricity industry next year 
the selloff is britains biggest and most complex privatization 
yet the conservative government has sold 64 billion worth of 
stateowned companies over the past decade to promote capitalism 
and encourage wider ownership of the companies 
the privatizations include telephone gas and water utilities 
as well as british airways plc british aerospace plc and the 
automaker jaguar plc which has since been bought by ford motor co 
critics had questioned the governments timing of its latest 
sale noting that many investors have shied away from the stock 
market since the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait they also cite 
the worldwide economic slowdown 
the government had planned to cancel the sale if a war broke out 
in the persian gulf 
but kleinwort said it received 1275 million applications from 
individual investors the highest response ever for a government 
privatization 
energy secretary john wakeham said only about 25 percent of the 
applicants will receive all the shares they requested and many 
investors will receive only the minimum 100 shares because of the 
huge demand 
he said some shares will go to about 97 percent of the 
applicants who are electricity customers while twothirds of all 
applicants will receive some shares 
officials noted the clawback provision will boost the 
percentage of shares available to the public to 546 percent from 
344 percent british institutional investors will now get 304 
percent of shares and foreign investors will receive 15 percent 
shares will begin trading tuesday afternoon analysts are 
predicting prices will jump 40 percent to 50 percent when trading 
begins 
the london stock exchange plans to remain open an extra 90 
minutes tuesday to accommodate anticipated heavy dealing 
there might very well be a scramble tomorrow afternoon for the 
shares among institutions that saw their allocations scaled back 
said sean darby an analyst at the investment firm yamaichi 
international europe ltd 
the government has made sure that everybody has got something 
but basically they kept it down to the lowest rung he said

volkswagen plans to invest up to 63 
billion in the czechoslovak car company skoda the german carmaker 
said after winning a bid to take over the company 
franstisek vlasak deputy premier of the czech republic told a 
news conference in prague on monday that cooperation between the 
two car companies will begin in january 
a joint stock venture will be formed with volkswagen pumping in 
some 300 million at the start vlasak said 
ortwin witzel a volkswagen spokesman said skodas 21000 
employees were assured of no layoffs in the deal which is to begin 
with a 35 percent investment in skoda next year that will reach 70 
percent by 1995 
on sunday czechoslovakia announced that volkswagen had outbid 
renault of france and swedens volvo for skoda 
the company is considered one of the best auto manufacturers in 
eastern europe it has a long manufacturing tradition using its 
own designs and its cars have a reputation for reliability 
volkswagen said skoda will become another of vws subsidiaries 
joining audi and volkswagen in germany and seat in spain 
in the first stage beginning next year volkswagen said the 
venture will produce 200000 favoritmodel skodas by 1997 that 
number is to increase to 400000 cars a year 
skoda currently produces about 250000 cars a year 
volkswagen said it foresees a market of up to 3 million vehicles 
in the central european region by the year 2000 
volkswagen said it will modernize skodas main manufacturing 
facility in mlada boleslav and eventually build a new engine 
factory and assembly plant 
volkswagen said the motor plant is to be completed by 1995 and 
produce about 500000 engines for the czechoslovak auto industry as 
well as for other volkswagen units 
an international distribution network will also be developed to 
sell skoda cars outside europe the company said 
a contract must still be signed between the two companies and a 
new leadership named

contract by the end of the year

advertising spending is expected to grow next 
year at the slowest pace in more than two decades but should pick 
up along with the economy in 1992 a prominent industry forecaster 
says 
some analysts say the forecast may be too optimistic while 
other executives expressed reservations about whether the economy 
will improve as expected in the second half of 1991 
robert coen an executive at the ad agency mccannerickson said 
monday he expects us ad spending will rise 49 percent to 1301 
billion this year the smallest increase since 48 percent in 1975 
next year he said spending should grow 46 percent to 136 
billion the smallest increase since a 07 percent increase in 
1970 
coen blamed the slowdown on the economic downturn and worries 
created by the persian gulf standoff newspapers are being 
especially hard hit 
coen whose semiannual forecasts of ad spending trends for the 
investment firm painewebber inc are the most closely watched in 
the industry has scaled back his estimate of ad spending growth 
for 1990 twice in the past year 
last december he said domestic ad spending would grow 62 
percent in 1990 he trimmed that projection to 53 percent last 
june 
coen said he is hopeful that improvements in the economy in the 
latter half of 1991 and the prospect of the olympic games could 
start another resurgence in ad spending in 1992 
he told the 18th annual painewebber media conference that 
national ad spending will rise 67 percent to 736 billion this 
year while local ad spending will increase a meager 28 percent to 
565 billion 
national ad spending is doing better than his december 1989 
forecast of a 63 percent increase but local ad spending has come 
in well below his earlier estimate of 62 percent growth 
he said newspapers for instance saw local ad spending grow at 
a slim 1 percent pace this year as spending by retailers slumped 
due to their heavy debt loads the poor business environment and 
deteriorating consumer confidence 
in addition he said the deepening decline in classified ad 
spending resulting from rising unemployment and a sluggish housing 
market made it a disastrous year for local ad spending in 
newspapers 
he expects only 2 percent growth in local ad spending in 
newspapers next year but added that a revival in the economy could 
lead to a fast turnaround 
national advertising on the other hand was stronger than 
expected this year partly because of increased competition for 
market share in categories such as coffee credit cards and mutual 
funds coen said 
for 1991 coen said he expects national ad spending will rise 
57 percent and local ad spending will increase 31 percent 
until unemployment rates fall and the real estate and housing 
sectors turn around we must continue to be pessimistic about local 
ad growth next year coen said 
gordon medenica vice president for corporate planning at the 
ew york times co said operating profits in the newspaper 
industry fell about 3 percent in 1990 and could fall another 2 to 4 
percentage points next year 
he said he was also a little worried about this consensus 
forecast that the economy will improve in the second half 
jack butcher circulation director at the tampa fla tribune 
said he expects the average cover price of newspapers will rise to 
35 cents daily and 1 on sundays in 1991 from their current levels 
of 30 cents and 75 cents 
but he said he expects the industry will still be able to show 
circulation growth of 05 percent to 1 percent because improvements 
such as more localized reporting better printing quality and color 
have been made 
some analysts said coen may be too optimistic about national ad 
spending next year 
his forecast for example calls for a 61 percent rise in 
national broadcast advertising compared with 78 percent in 1990 
but david f poltrack a top researcher at the cbs broadcast 
group said he expects ad spending on the big three television 
networks will rise only 2 percent this year and 2 percent in 1991 
he said revenue at cbs abc and nbc was about 5 percent ahead of 
last year for the first nine months of 1990 but that the bottom 
fell out of the market in the fourth quarter which will be 
down significantly from 1989 
ad spending growth outside the united states continues to 
outpace domestic ad spending increases coen said 
he said ad spending overseas rose 126 percent to 1455 billion 
in 1990 and is expected to increase 75 percent to 1564 billion 
in 1991

in a major step toward resolving the nations 
biggest product liability issue a federal judge has consolidated 
tens of thousands of lawsuits against a company filed by victims of 
asbestosrelated diseases 
us district judge jack b weinstein late monday certified a 
class action for 65000 worker health claims against eaglepicher 
industries inc and froze all litigation against the 
cincinnatibased industrial products maker 
but victims lawyers said weinstein had flouted legal procedure 
appointed partisan attorneys to negotiate with the company who 
supported his desires and sought to force a settlement they said 
was unfair 
the judges attitude is there is no constitution among 
friends said ron motley a charleston sc attorney for 
several thousands asbestos victims 
he was not acting as judge he was acting as king said fred 
baron a dallas plaintiffs lawyer fortunately in this country 
the laws are not determined by kings 
lawyers said they would appeal weinsteins order which also 
appeared to violate an automatic halt on legal proceedings in the 
case imposed when a motion was filed monday in cincinnati to place 
eaglepicher in involuntary bankruptcy 
if it succeeds weinsteins plan could become a model for dozens 
of companies struggling under the burden of asbestos liability and 
help clear state and federal courts nationwide of 90000 asbestos 
cases 
litigation has mounted since the early 1970s when medical 
evidence grew that asbestos was responsible for lung cancer and 
other respiratory diseases in americans who worked in shipbuilding 
boilermaking and other trades where the mineral was used as a fire 
retardant and insulator 
the biggest case involves the manville trust fund which faces 
130000 claims the fund has run out of cash and is being 
reorganized under weinsteins orders the trust was created out of 
the 1988 bankruptcy reorganization of manville corp once the 
nations largest asbestos user 
weinstein who crafted a classaction solution to illnesses 
caused by the vietnam war defoliant agent orange wants to 
consolidate asbestos cases to eliminate long and costly trials that 
have delayed payments to victims and squandered money on legal 
costs 
judge weinstein is out to break the logjam of national 
asbestos litigation by certifying the class which will be the 
beginning of the end of asbestos litigation said kenneth 
feinberg a weinsteinappointed mediator in the eaglepicher case 
eaglepicher which favors the class action has said it faces 
bankruptcy unless it solves its asbestos problems it is liable for 
injuries caused by cement insulation products containing asbestos 
it made from 1931 to 1971 
the company has spent 540 million in the last five years on its 
asbestos obligations and faces an estimated 600 million in future 
claims it has sold assets to pay claims but is running out of 
divisions to pawn as well as insurance the first case against the 
company was made in 1966 and about 20000 new claims are being 
filed annually 
under the settlement plan eaglepicher would place an estimated 
625 million into a trust fund over 20 years the trust also would 
receive 25 percent of eaglepicher stock and 50 percent if the 
company failed to meet its annual payments after five years 
payments would not begin until november 1993 
plaintiffs lawyers said the plan provides too little money and 
that victims would do better if eaglepicher filed for bankruptcy 
the main stumbling block appeared to be a demand that the trust 
control eaglepicher stock which the company refused 
only one of three lawyers appointed by weinstein to represent 
current eaglepicher victims has approved the plan and he doesnt 
have any asbestos clients more than 90 attorneys with 40000 
asbestos clients signed a petition opposing the proposal 
there is a massive lack of confidence in the settlement

the entrance of a general motors corp 
subsidiary into the race for the nextgeneration cellular phone 
technology will increase an industry fight over which system will 
prevail industry analysts say 
gm hughes electronics has developed technology it says will 
increase the capacity of cellular phone systems fifteenfold which 
would be a boon to overcrowded systems in cities such as new york 
and los angeles 
if theyre successful its going to bring the cellular 
industry to a big stall because people wont know what to do 
said john pemberton of the hightech research firm gartner group 
inc the standards battle could rage on for two years 
the cellular telecommunications industry association the 
industrys main trade group already has approved specifications 
for a digital technology that would replace todays analog cellular 
phones 
but the mostadvanced digital phone system envisioned by the 
trade group would only increase capacity six times below the 
tenfold increase the nations cellular phone operators say they 
will need to meet expected demand 
the trade group announced monday night that nine large cellular 
phone equipment makers agreed to a timetable for readying digital 
phone gear that uses the groups standard under it prototype 
equipment will be tested by march 31 meaning production should 
start later next year the group said 
the companies are motorola inc american telephone amp telegraph 
co ericsson audiovox mitsubishi novatel oki telecom sony and 
uniden 
hughes digital system to be formally announced today would 
provide much greater capacity than the systems to be tested it is 
based on the same technology called timedivision multiple access 
which allows several calls to be sent simultaneously over the same 
channel but hughes system is more advanced 
the timedivision technique introduces minute pauses into each 
call during these pauses another call in the cellular network is 
sent because the delays are so short and the call is sent in 
computer language the pauses are not noticed by the user 
but hughes system also uses pauses in conversations to send 
other calls said pradeep p kaul executive vice president of 
hughes network systems inc the hughes subsidiary that developed 
the system 
for example when a caller pauses in a conversation to listen to 
the other party the speaking portion of the signal would be 
switched off making it available for another call as soon as the 
caller resumes speaking a speachrecognition device would switch 
the signal back on 
hughes system will compete with a technology called 
codedivision multiple access in it several calls are sent at 
once over the same channel but each is preceded by a special code 
the receiving equipment only picks up calls with a particular code 
codedivision technology has been developed by a small san diego 
company called qualcomm atampt and motorola the two largest us 
makers of cellular telephone equipment are exploring qualcomms 
technology as well as timedivision techniques 
industry analysts say they believe timedivision technology will 
be used at least initially to boost the capacity of overtaxed 
cellular systems in major metropolitan areas 
but once the capacity of these timedivision systems is reached 
the industry will need yet another replacement said jason 
lamountain an analyst with the boston research firm yankee group 
inc 
he said hughes is one of a number of companies trying to boost 
timedivision technology to greater capacity at the same time 
codedivision technology will be vying for the replacement market 
he said proponents of this technology say it could boost capacity 
by twenty times over current analog systems 
as for the winner i think its going to be which one works 
none of them have been proven in the market lamountain said 
in another cellular development motorola said monday it had 
devised an enhanced analog system that increases capacity threefold 
over current systems it said it would began testing it in january 
hughes says it will use its technology to make the switching 
equipment used in each cell or geographic area of a cellular 
phone system and license the technology to other equipment makers 
it also said it would work with gms delco electronics corp to 
develop phones that would be built into the dashboards of cars 
in addition hughes announced that the french phoneequipment 
maker alactel would make the centraloffice phone switching 
equipment to be used with hughes cellular system

if the verbal skirmishes between a japanese 
auto parts maker and texas investor t boone pickens were a series 
of movie sequels theyd by up to number xiv or xv by now 
on monday koito manufacturing co called on pickens to disclose 
all the details of his arrangement with a japanese stock speculator 
to acquire a large stake in the company 
last week a new japanese securities law forced pickens who has 
portrayed himself as a david battling the goliath of japans 
corporate system to acknowledge that his 264 percent stake in 
koito was backed at least in part by stock speculator kitaro 
watanabe 
koito has used the specter of watanabe to rebuff pickens 
attempts to secure representation on its board of directors even 
though he is the largest single shareholder the company claims 
pickens is merely acting on behalf of watanabe in another attempt 
by the tokyo investor to obtain greenmail from koito 
greenmail a play on the word blackmail is what a company pays 
when it buys back its own stock from a potential raider at rates 
above the going market price 
koito has claimed that before watanabe sold his stake to pickens 
in march 1989 he tried to pursuade carmaker toyota motor corp 
koitos secondlargest shareholder to buy his stock at 
higherthanmarket prices 
it appears clear from your own statements that the entire 
transaction was an outright sham koitos president takao 
matsuura wrote pickens 
pickens has disclosed that he bought 424 million shares or 
264 percent of koito from watanabe who loaned him the money 
after pickens put up the shares as collateral the shares are now 
worth an estimated 1 billion 
pickens also submitted an affidavit stating he will not accept 
greenmail 
now that you have acknowledged your secret arrangement with 
mr watanabe i must insist that you disclose the remaining details 
that your filing omits the koito president wrote 
he wanted to know the conditions of the loan and what interest 
pickens dallasbased boone co had paid on it 
but the new japanese law does not require pickens who has 
steadfastly denied that he is fronting for watanabe to disclose 
further details about the loan 
according to our lawyers and the japanese ministry of 
finance those are the two material agreements that we have to 
reveal regarding the ownership of the koito stock said a pickens 
spokesman in washington mark helmke now comes koito saying 
you havent told us what your interest rate is you havent told 
us what your payment schedule is none of thats required 
helmke added thats the game they play if the ministry of 
finance wants to require everybody in japan to disclose that 
information we would be be happy to comply they want the americans 
to disclose more than what they require of the japanese

regulators hope to unload hardtosell real 
estate and junk bonds inherited from failed savings and loans by 
financing 85 percent or more of the purchase price 
real estate agents and builders are applauding the move a major 
strategy shift for the resolution trust corp as a realistic 
recognition of the credit crunch that is pinching real estate 
markets 
but a congressional critic charged monday that the new policy is 
only a costly way of postponing resolution of the sampl mess 
theyre just going to sink into the same quicksand that the 
sampl operators couldnt pull themselves out of said rep bruce 
vento dminn who heads a house task force monitoring the 
bailout i just think they would be better off to face up to the 
problem now 
the rtc oversight board is more than doubling the lending limit 
from the previous 3 billion ventos panel planned to review the 
policy and other aspects of the rtcs performance at a hearing 
today 
in the deteriorating economy the agency has encountered far 
more problems than anticipated in selling real estate junk bonds 
and other assets inherited from failed sampls 
banks in many regions also have grown increasingly reluctant to 
lend particularly on commercial real estate causing what 
borrowers complain is a shortage of credit 
by offering financing the rtc is in effect becoming its own 
bank 
the goals of the program are to speed asset sales and increase 
the value to taxpayers from such sales said oversight board 
president peter monroe 
however vento said the government will run the risk of having 
to repossess financed properties if buyers default its better to 
sell the property outright at whatever price can be obtained he 
said 
the administration frankly has been offering one excuse 
after another as to why they cant do what they said they were 
going to do vento said 
however analysts said real estate markets are so slack in areas 
where the rtc owns property that the agency has little choice 
their backs are to the wall said economist robert litan of 
the brookings institution a washingtonbased research group 
ordinarily if it werent for the recession they shouldnt be 
doing this 
kent colton executive vice president of the national 
association of home builders endorsed the strategy shift as a 
recognition of the credit crunch that has prevented buyers from 
obtaining private financing 
it will revive real estate markets in the south and southwest 
where many of the properties are located said harley e rouda 
president of the national association of realtors 
economist paul m horvitz of the university of houston said the 
financing policy would work provided the rtc demands enough of a 
down payment 
people in texas tell me it is difficult to get financing on a 
traditional basis for the acquisition of real estate in that 
situation it makes sense to me for the rtc to be willing to 
provide financing as long as the buyer puts up some reasonable 
amount of equity he said 
in general the rtc will require at least a 15 percent down 
payment but in some cases may accept less 
about half of the 142 billion in assets controlled by the 
agency will be eligible for financing much of it is commercial 
real estate but some illiquid financial assets such as junk bonds 
are also eligible 
before the agency can lend the governments money to buyers the 
oversight board said it must determine that no ready market exists 
for the asset and then document that providing a loan will help the 
government get a better price on the sale 
the agency hopes to sell the loans it makes thereby making more 
money available for financing 
the oversight board decided on its new financing policy in 
private late friday and announced it after business hours 
the fivemember panel headed by treasury secretary nicholas f 
brady controls the policy and purse strings of the bailout agency 
the panel includes federal reserve chairman alan greenspan housing 
secretary jack kemp and two private citizens

congress needs to stand firm behind a march 1 
deadline for an international trade agreement in order to assure 
that meat and grain producers have better access to world markets 
the american farm bureau federation says 
it is probably imperative that the congress agree or follows 
through with the administrations analysis that congress isnt 
going to change the fasttrack deadline unless there is reason 
to bureau spokesman donald lipton said monday 
he also said president bush needed to exercise personal 
diplomacy to break the deadlock in international trade talks a 
step the administration said monday it was plannin to take 
president bush undoubtedly will be talking to various leaders 
about the gatt situation white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said using the acronym for general agreement on tariffs and trade 
the framework agreement for world trade 
lipton like many farm group representatives went to brussels 
belgium last week to observe the meeting of trade ministers hoping 
to conclude the socalled uruguay round of talks with an agreement 
on how to conduct trade into the 21st century 
however the delegates never came close to agreement because of 
a fight between the united states and the 12nation european 
community over farm subsidies 
the united states backed by australia brazil and other major 
farm exporters was seeking sharp reductions in subsidies the ec 
claimed the us proposal would force more than 2 million of its 10 
million farmers off the land 
the trade ministers told gatt director arthur dunkel in brussels 
to try to get at least lowlevel discussions started again by late 
january 
under the fasttrack provision of us trade law the 
administration has a deadline for submitting an agreement to 
congress and congress has a deadline for ratifying it without any 
changes 
the deadline can be extended legislatively for a twoyear 
period 
lipton said that without the deadline other industry groups 
with an interest in the outcome of the trade proposal could lobby 
to weaken the agricultural provisions but he also said he was also 
encouraged by what he saw last week 
in brussels it was remarkable how united the various sectors 
were he said referring to us groups with an interest in the 
other provisions such as intellectual property services and 
investments 
other farm interests agreed with lipton that the desirability of 
other provisions could help force an agreement on farm products as 
well 
theyve got a lot at stake over there said keith heard 
executive vice president of the national corn growers association 
im guardedly optimistic said marlyn jorgensen a garrison 
iowa soybean farmer and board chairman of the american soybean 
association i think there was in the end kind of a feeling by 
most other countries that we needed something to happen 
if there is no agreement then i think that we do have to turn 
back to congress and ask that a socalled snapback provision 
under the 1990 farm bill be implemented jorgensen said 
the fiveyear farm bill reflecting budget problems cut farm 
supports by onefourth he noted the snapback provision allows 
congress to restore supports if there is no trade agreement but 
not for two years 
he said the united states could increase credit guarantees to 
the soviet union to help growers 
meat producers want the united states to flex some muscle 
immediately 
in the interim id like to see the government take some 
action to show were intent upon forcing our rights said michael 
kopps senior vice president for legislative affairs at the 
american meat institute 
he said the us trade representative could vigorously pursue 
the industrys complaint about european restrictions on american 
meat products including the oct 30 ban on pork imports and the 
announced dec 31 ban on beef the european community commission 
said the bans were due to lack of proper sanitation in the united 
states 
domestic sugar plant growers and dairy farmers meanwhile were 
not enthusiastic about the usbacked agricultural proposals 
dalton yancey a spokesman for sugar cane and sugar beet 
growers said he objected to a percentage formula for cutting price 
supports because the european guaranteed price is much higher than 
the us price 32 cents vs 18 cents 
the guaranteed price is part of the farm bill and is maintained 
by restricting imports critics say the policy deprives latin 
american producing countries of an important source of income and 
causes consumer prices to be artificially high 
peter vitaliano of the national milk producers federation said 
the group opposes any plan to increase imports and called the 
dispute a grain trade issue to a great extent

the life insurance industry which controls 
nearly 2 trillion could suffer the same fate as the savings and 
loans jeopardizing the financial security of millions of 
americans a senator contends 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio who chairs the senate judiciary 
subcommittee on antitrust said financially shaky insurers are able 
to conceal their real problems through questionable accounting 
gimmicks and with little policing from the states 
but am best co which operates a wellregarded system of 
rating insurance companies says insurers have maintained their 
secure standing especially in comparison to other financial 
industries 
we do not agree that the insurance industry as a whole at 
this point in time is on the brink of financial crisis analogous to 
that of the savings and loan industry michael albanese a best 
analyst told the subcommittee monday 
metzenbaum cited a report by ids life co of minneapolis 
predicting that the loss of consumer confidence following the 
failure of a prominent insurer could have a widespread effect on 
the industry with massive cash withdrawals induced by the 
insolvency of one insurer leading to the insolvency of other less 
financially secure companies 
albanese said best would not support the dire conclusions 
which have been reached regarding the potential insolvencies of 
several large and prominent insurers in the event of unspecified 
economic scenarios 
metzenbaum called the hearing to explore whether the insurance 
industry and policyholders are jeopardized by insurers heavy 
investment in highrisk junk bonds and commercial real estate that 
because of a slowing economy has lost much of its value 
life insurance companies are said to hold about four times as 
many junk bonds as sampls did before scores of thrift institutions 
collapsed in the late 1980s 
metzenbaum argued that lax state regulation allows insurers to 
list the value of bonds and real estate as their purchase price 
rather than much lower current worth 
thomas h borman minnesota commerce commissioner said state 
regulators must learn from the mistakes of sampl regulators and 
require insurers to update the valuations of their holdings 
this is yet another thinly disguised attempt to dupe the 
public into believing that their security blanket is not in 
jeopardy metzenbaum said the insurance industry and 
particularly the life insurance industry has enormous sums 
invested in these troubled assets 
terence lennon chief examiner of the new york insurance 
department questioned the logic of such a move unless an insurers 
liabilities its promise to pay off on policies in the future 
also are revalued because of the wide variety of policies now 
available he said that would be a mistake 
metzenbaum had asked six life insurance companies to testify at 
the hearing they declined and the senator said their refusal 
sends a loud and clear message they cannot stand the tough 
scrutiny that the public demands and deserves 
the american council of life insurance which represents most 
companies was not allowed to testify but submitted a brief written 
statement from president richard s schweiker 
because life companies have liabilities that are longterm they 
match them with longterm assets bonds he said insurers list 
those bonds at book value because changes in market interest rates 
have almost no impact on the ability of the bond issuer to meet 
interest obligations or repay principal schweiker wrote 
metzenbaum is exploring whether the federal government should 
take over some or all of the task of regulating the insurance 
industry from the states

a fastfood kiddie club promises fun 
nonstop beer is billed as the beverage of choice on halloween 
and a cigarette maker portrays itself as a patriotic defender of 
freedom 
those are some of the advertisements an array of consumer 
environmental and health groups contended monday are among the 
years most misleading unfair or irresponsible 
the sixth annual harlan page hubbard lemon awards honor the 
legacy of the man who tirelessly promoted lydia pinkhams vegetable 
compound as a remedy for ailments ranging from fatigue to cancer 
needless to say the cureall claim was pure quackery 
the center for science in the public interest called hubbard 
the first advertising executive to employ deceptive advertising 
techniques on a national scale and said his spirit lives in the 
commercials of today 
the sponsors of the modernday ads begged to differ those who 
could be found said they stood firmly behind their products and 
commercials 
its been wonderfully successful and lots of fun burger 
king corp spokesman cori zywtow said of the chains kids 
clubs program 
exactly how much fun was the question asked by action for 
childrens television in nominating burger king for a hubbard 
the ad promises fun nonstop and shows groups of children 
happily engaged in what are presumably club activities but act 
said they actually receive little more than a membership card and 
some stickers 
zywtow said the 27 million members also get posters a 
newsletter and special meals does that constitute nonstop fun 
it has been a terrific program she replied were very proud 
of it 
general motors corp also took issue with its two citations by 
the center for auto safety and the safe energy communication 
council 
the safety center said gm misrepresented itself in one ad by 
claiming that it pioneered the air bag it said the company 
fought government rules to require air bags and now equips fewer 
models with them than ford or chrysler 
the energy council denounced an ad touting the cutlass supreme 
as fuelefficient even though it gets lower mileage than most of 
gms other models 
gus buenz a spokesman for oldsmobile countered that gm had 
airbags in cars as early as 1974 and has a strong tradition of 
safety research 
he said the cutlass ad was meant to highlight the cars 
roominess price and responsiveness as well as fuel economy all 
were doing is telling people you can get all those things plus 30 
mpg on the highway buenz said 
another double winner was philip morris companies inc parent 
of the cigarette maker its alleged lemons 
a virginia slims ad that according to the national womens 
health network implies a brand called superslims can help 
women stay thin 
a series of ads celebrating the bill of rights the coalition 
on smoking or health accused the firm of appropriating one of the 
countrys most important documents for its own greedy purposes 
namely the defeat of government restrictions on tobacco 
promotion 
philip morris spokesman les zuke said it was absurd to read 
a weight pitch in the superslims ad he said the commercial makes 
two claims superslims emits 70 percent less smoke from the lit end 
and superslims is an ultralight cigarette that tastes good 
the first nominee to a newly established hubbard hall of 
shame was a volvo ad that showed a volvo surviving as a truck 
drove over its roof the car had been specially reinforced during 
production of the ad a fact the company says it did not know 
until after the spot aired 
it was never volvos intention to deceive or mislead the 
public said spokesman robert austin a mistake was made we 
went out and told the public that with our own corrective 
advertisement 
among others receiving laurels for the years worst ads 
coors brewing co for coors light ads that feature a haunted 
house and the line that it isnt halloween without the silver 
bullet its appeal to children is chilling said the national 
council on alcoholism and drug dependence inc 
kellogg co for saying that protein in special k cereal can 
help women maintain healthy muscle tone while dieting the iowa 
attorney general has alleged in federal court that the ads are 
misleading said the center for science in the public interest 
celeste clark vice president of nutrition marketing at kellogg 
said special k has been marketed as a highprotein cereal for 35 
years the ad campaign is not meant to indicate that special k 
alone can help you lose weight she said

the family that developed southland corp from an 
ice company into the nations largest operator of convenience 
stores will relinquish the control they have held for nearly 60 
years as the company is restructured 
southland officials said monday that officials from the japanese 
companies that would buy a majority of southlands stock will 
dominate the board and management including masatoshi ito as 
chairman 
ito would replace chairman john p thompson son of the late joe 
c thompson the patriarch who developed southland 
ito is president of itoyokado group and chairman of 7eleven 
japan the two companies that propose paying 430 million to buy 70 
percent of southland 
clark matthews southlands chief financial officer would 
become the companys president and chief executive officer 
according to the plan filed monday he would replace jere thompson 
toshifumi suzuki itoyokado executive vice president would 
become vice chairman of southlands board 
mondays announcement confirmed speculation about a severely 
reduced role for the thompsons that followed southlands first 
proposals in march for a restructuring in an offer revised several 
times since then southland wants to exchange 18 billion in 
expensive loans for less costly notes and sell control of the 
company to the japanese companies for the muchneeded cash 
southland filed a prepackaged bankruptcy plan in october after 
gaining approval from the companys major creditors southland 
hopes to emerge from court protection within months 
each of the thompson brothers john jere and joe c would 
receive a 960000 annual salary for five years under terms of the 
reorganization plan 
the retention of matthews as a top managing officer at southland 
underscores the confidence of our japanese partners in the 
current management of the company southland spokeswoman cecilia 
norwood said monday 
john and jere thompson would remain members of southlands board 
as vice chairmen in that role they would remain actively involved 
in strategic planning ms norwood said 
the third brother joe c thompson and matthews also would 
become company directors 
southland outlined its proposed management team which depends 
on confirmation of its restructuring plan by us bankruptcy judge 
harold abramson in documents filed with the court monday 
the new japanese owners would control 10 seats on southlands 
board of 15 to 17 members the thompsons directly control three 
seats indicating the japanese approved the appointment of one of 
the thompsons or matthews to the board 
a committee that represents the companys bondholders would 
appoint two other unnamed board members

the deficit in the broadest measure of foreign 
trade widened sharply to 2559 billion in the julyseptember 
quarter the worst showing since late last year the government 
reported today 
the 139 percent jump in the deficit was blamed on the fallout 
from the persian gulf crisis which drove up the price americans 
pay for imported oil and also boosted the countrys spending on 
overseas military operations 
the commerce department said the third quarter deficit in the 
countrys current account trade deficit compared to a 2249 
billion deficit in the second quarter it was the widest imbalance 
since a deficit of 2669 billion in the octoberdecember quarter 
of last year 
the improvement in the countrys trade deficit had been the one 
bright spot in a generally lackluster us economy improving 
export sales had provided more than half of overall growth this 
year 
however analysts are now worried that a widening trade deficit 
will be one more drag on an economy many believe is already in a 
recession they fear that if the gap between us exports and 
imports widens significantly it will worsen the severity of the 
recession 
the current account is the countrys most important trade 
statistic because it measures not only trade in merchandise but 
also trade in services and investment flows between countries 
the big deterioration in the third quarter came from a sharply 
higher merchandise deficit which climbed 289 percent to 2975 
billion compared to a deficit of 2310 billion in the second 
quarter 
more than onehalf of the increase in imports stemmed from 
higher petroleum prices following iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the balance on investment earnings shifted into a surplus of 
246 billion reflecting improved earnings by americans on their 
overseas investments this had been in deficit by 1 billion in the 
second quarter 
the united states also ran a surplus in the services category of 
582 billion in the third quarter this reflected a drop of 28 
percent from the second quarter figure of 598 billion 
payments to foreigners on services increased to 278 billion 
up 73 percent from the second quarter this reflected higher 
travel and passenger fares paid by americans to foreign airlines 
and also higher direct defense spending because of the stationing 
of us troops in the middle east 
the other component of the current account unilateral transfer 
payments primarily foreign aid payments and government pension 
payments to americans living overseas increased the deficit by 
411 billion 
the current account is the trade statistic that is most closely 
watched by economists because it shows the amount of borrowing the 
united states must do each quarter to finance the shortfall between 
imports of goods services and investments and exports in those 
categories 
a decade ago america was the largest creditor nation it ran 
surpluses in its current account as the earnings from its overseas 
investments were enough to offset perennial deficits in merchandise 
trade 
but as americans handed over billions of dollars to foreigners 
to pay for imported merchandise the investment cushion eroded and 
disappeared altogether in 1985 when the united states became a net 
debtor for the first time in 71 years 
that means that foreigners now own more in us assets than 
americans own overseas a development which has led some to fear 
the country is losing control of its economic destiny to 
foreigners 
at the end of 1989 the countrys net debtor position was put at 
6637 billion up a sharp 25 percent from the previous year 
analysts believe that figure will grow by close to another 100 
billion this year and will hit 1 trillion before it starts to 
improve

corp from nearly nothing to the nations 16th largest industrial 
corporation his grip on the company was so tight that critics 
called it a stranglehold 
today the question is whether his successor ray r irani can 
hold together a company long regarded as a natural takeover target 
worth far less as a whole than broken into its separate businesses 
oil and gas chemicals natural gas pipelines pork and beef coal 
occidental stock was up 225 at 23 per share in heavy trading 
this morning on the new york stock exchange after trading up about 
the same amount in london today 
analysts and investors have watched occidental with fascination 
and often suspicion for decades wondering how long hammer could 
last and who would try to replace him now with his death monday 
at 92 they will find out 
from 1970 to the mid1980s hammer rid himself of at least 10 
executives who had believed they were his corporate heir the joke 
was that so many people had occupied the occidental presidents 
office that it should have a revolving door 
in 1984 irani was named president and chief operating officer 
in february of this year hammer anointed irani his successortobe 
as occidentals chairman and chief executive 
among other things hammer praised iranis leadership of 
occidentals chemical operations which grew from a 1983 loss of 
38 million on sales of 17 billion to 1989 profits of more than 
1 billion on 52 billion in sales 
the move was designed to calm the wild swings in stock price 
that resulted from the merest rumors of ill health for hammer who 
had a history of heart problems and received a pacemaker in 
november 1989 
it also clearly underlined that irani was entirely in control of 
daytoday operations at occidental 
that point was an important one at a time when hammer after 
seven decades as one of the worlds most prominent businessmen 
increasingly showed signs of senility often losing touch with 
reality according to associates who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
in declining to reveal details of those problems occidental 
walked a fine line again with the securities and exchange 
commission which requires disclosure of significant facts 
affecting a publicly held company

he was on wall street has died at age 92 
hammer died at his home monday night after a brief illness said 
frank ashley a spokesman for hammers occidental petroleum corp 
hammer a selfmade millionaire by the time he graduated from 
columbia university medical school at age 23 was also a 
philanthropist art collector and crusader for world peace 
he was absolutely indomitable said his attorney arthur 
groman he never lost his courage or tenacity in the last 
months he was uncomplaining and optimistic 
hammer exhibited a flair for the dramatic until the end 
deciding to celebrate his bar mitzvah which marks a jewish boys 
13th birthday at age 92 he died the night before the ceremony 
hammer was born a jew but his family did not follow religious 
customs 
were going to go ahead with the event said spokesman 
howard bragman hes done extraordinary things for the jewish 
people and since tuesday night is the first night of hanukkah 
we think that a light in the jewish community like dr hammer who 
did so much for jewish freedom should be remembered 
hammer a global businessman who knew world leaders from 
vladimir lenin to george bush negotiated deals with communist 
countries such as china and the soviet union to develop resources 
for years he urged american presidents to meet with their soviet 
counterparts and encouraged the reduction of nuclear weapons so 
the money could be diverted to agriculture and medicine 
mr hammer was associated with one of the most remarkable 
pages of our relationship with the united states soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev said today in a condolence message 
he met with lenin and was very close in many ways to the soviet 
union and to russia 
hammer made several fortunes and gave huge sums to his favorite 
causes especially cancer research the only reason i make money 
is so i can give it away he was fond of saying 
after the chernobyl nuclear accident in the soviet union he 
arranged visits by us specialists in bonemarrow transplants 
which helped save radiation victims 
his empire rested on los angelesbased occidental petroleum 
corp which he bought for 100000 in 1957 and turned into one of 
the nations largest industrial companies 
ray irani the companys president and chief operations officer 
succeeds hammer as chairman hammers death makes the company a 
potential takeover target 
his art collection is displayed at the armand hammer museum of 
art and culture which opened last month 
shareholders sued claiming company money was squandered on the 
museum a settlement capped the companys contribution to it at 
just under 100 million 
hammer was born in 1898 in new york city his russianborn 
father a doctor was a founder of the american communist party 
but hammer was a staunch capitalist who would say to communists 
i tell them that i dont think their system works but that 
doesnt keep us from doing business 
after world war i hammer went to medical school at night and 
worked to bail out the familys struggling pharmaceutical firm 
he turned the business into a milliondollar company in part 
because he was able to market tincture of ginger sometimes used to 
give an alcoholic kick to ginger ale during prohibition 
after the bolshevik revolution hammer worked out a deal to 
trade surplus us grain for soviet products hammer became a 
soviet hero for helping ease food shortages in the embattled 
country lenin licensed him as the sole representative of 38 
leading american manufacturers 
hammer could not work with josef stalin and sold his enterprises 
to the soviet government 
for the next 25 years he was an art dealer a cattle breeder in 
new jersey and a whiskey distiller in kentucky 
in 1940 he parlayed a 100000 investment into 75 million by 
making blended whiskey from potatoes 
hammer bought occidental as a tax shelter when it was near 
bankruptcy today the company boasts huge oil natural gas coal 
chemical and agribusiness operations 
in 1975 hammer was charged with making a secret 54000 
donation president nixons campaign fund 
he pleaded guilty was put on probation and fined 3000 and 
began campaigning for a pardon which president bush gave him last 
year

trading was quiet in anticipation of the release later today of 
the us agriculture departments supply and demand report 
the market was also anticipating a visit to washington on 
wednesday of soviet foreign minister eduard schevardnadze there 
was a belief the usda will use the occasion to announce the award 
of us aid or the granting of export credits to the soviets 
the question in the market is the size of the credits 
said victor lespinasse an analyst with dean witter reynolds inc 
if it is a billion dollars it will be bearish for the market if 
it is a couple of billion dollars it would be bullish

by december 1993 gm president lloyd reuss and tony march chairman 
of the 11member gm minority dealer advisory council said today 
the company has 192 black hispanic and asian dealers making up 
2 percent of its approximately 9600 dealers 
increased minority participation in our dealerships is vital 
to achieving gms prime objective of the 1990s satisfying car and 
truck owners better than any other manufacturer reuss said in a 
statement 
the automaker has conducted a minority dealertraining program 
since 1972 but one of gms leading black dealers said the new 
agreement went an important step further 
there is no doubt in my mind about the commitment of lloyd 
reuss and gm chairman bob stempel said march a buick dealer 
from hartford conn we are talking about a commitment from the 
largest corporation in the world 
some people were pushing the idea of a separate target 
figure for new black dealers said another council member 
chevrolet dealer charles harrell of flat rock but we didnt want 
to get into that kind of trap well get our fair share 
gm intends to increase the number of minority dealers in cities 
with relatively large minority populations according to a gm

dealerships folded this year leaving no blackowned gm franchises 
in the metropolitan area 
at ford motor co and chrysler corp minorities make up 57

communications inc the nations top cellular phone operation and 
has been called an ideal match remaining regulatory hurdles are

merrill lynch amp co said it will offer a 
100000 reward to veteran employees under a new program that 
analysts said was an attempt to keep other firms from robbing 
workers the company has spent money on to train 
under the program announced monday brokers and other financial 
consultants who remain with the company 10 years and meet other 
requirements can collect the reward as early as the year 2001 
company executives said 
we want to send a message that there are longterm positive 
opportunities on wall street said john l steffens executive 
vice president for the brokerages private client division during 
a press conference to announce the program 
however analysts said merrill lynchs new reward for loyalty 
could spur other brokerage firms to follow suit with similar 
compensation systems in what could turn into a bidding war for 
highperformance employees 
i think theyll take up the torch in a modified way that could 
become competitive said perrin long an analyst who follows the 
securities industry for lipper analytical securities corp 
for example a competing company could offer loyal employees 
100000 at the end of nine years instead of 10 years he said 
to be eligible for the 100000 bonus merrill lynch workers 
must participate in a new training program designed to raise their 
skills to a level company executives said will make them more 
competitive in todays financial services environment 
as part of the program new hires will join an expanded twoyear 
training program where they must successfully complete courses 
focusing on such subjects as money management sales client 
service and product knowledge 
however long said he was skeptical about the programs ability 
to combat lucrative offers from competing firms for 
highperformance brokers 
merrill lynchs turnover rate is between 14 percent to 15 
percent according to the company 
even though someones being promised 100000 maybe at the 
end of six years somebody else comes along and says well give you 
100000150000 up front long said 
merrill lynch executives declined to discuss the cost of the 
program however they said that productivity gains would more than 
cover its price tag 
if everybody made it remained at merrill lynch for the next 
10 years it would add several hundred million dollars to merrill 
lynchs bottom line said steffens 
all told 10500 domestic workers will be eligible for the 
reward 
long estimated the twoyear training program for new hires would 
cost merrill lynch 4000045000 per employee compared with 
2500030000 a worker for the previous program

stock in britains 12 newly privatized regional 
electricity companies sprinted as much as 775 percent higher 
tuesday as they began trading on londons stock exchange 
a mixed package of 1000 of the 12 stocks jumped to 1595 
pounds or 3110 shortly after trading commenced at 230 pm 
from a partly paid price of 1000 pounds or 1950 
the london markets overall volume was a robust 4708 million 
shares at midafternoon more than twice the 2307 million shares 
traded by midday 
dealers said trading in the new stock was very busy with 
millions of shares quickly changing hands the exchange extended 
trading for 1 hours until 6 pm tuesday to handle the heavy 
volume 
institutional investors were scrambling to get more stock after 
the government scaled back their allocation because of strong 
demand from the general public dealers said 
but some small investors were holding on to their stakes to take 
advantage of the discounts on electricity bills and dividend 
payments 
the 518 billion pound or 101 billion sale of 216 billion 
shares was 107 times oversubscribed with personal investors 
making 1275 million applications 
the general public is getting about 55 percent of the shares and 
domestic institutional investors are getting 30 percent with 15 
percent going to foreign investors 
the sheer number of applications also prompted the government to 
reduce most allocations to 100 shares each 
the immediate sharp rise in the shares prices prompted 
opposition labor party leader neil kinnock to accuse the 
conservative government in the house of commons of swindling the 
british public by selling a british asset at what he said was 3 
billion pounds or 59 billion below its true value 
prime minister john major rejected the charge saying the offer 
provided value to shareholders 
the shares were offered at 240 pence or 468 each payable in 
three instalments the first 100 pence or 195 partial payment 
was due on application

dont bank on it but theres a possibility you 
might have a sizeable refund coming from your mortgage lender the 
result of errors in computing your adjustable rate payments 
while nobody knows the full extent of the computing errors the 
total is likely to be huge even in the billions of dollars 
refunding the money could become still another financial problem 
for already shaky lenders 
the first hint of errors came in the summer of 1989 when a 
former employee of the federal savings amp loan insurance corp 
studied portfolios of failed thrift institutions and found errors 
in a large percentage of mortgage loans 
seeking to determine the scope of the problem federal 
regulators already have asked lending institutions to audit their 
portfolios among these regulators were the federal reserve and the 
office of thrift supervision 
meanwhile a recent report from the general accounting office 
contains estimates that between 20 percent and 30 percent of all 
adjustable rate mortgages might have been calculated incorrectly 
for the most part assumptions to date are that the 
miscalculations were inadvertent rather than an attempt to defraud 
customers in fact it is likely that some errors favor borrowers 
rather than lenders 
why then have they occurred information to date suggests the 
answer lies in the complexity of caculations why didnt customers 
find the errors for the same reason complexity that caused 
lenders to make them 
hsh associates which tracks rates at institutions around the 
country and calls itself the nations largest publisher of mortgage 
information says errors could involve wrong dates wrong indexes 
and just poor arithmetic 
adjustable rate mortgages or arms are changed on a regular 
basis by rises or declines in an independent index such as the 
oneyear treasury bill rate or the sixmonth treasury bill 
rate or the eleventh district cost of funds 
most arms says hsh add a margin or markup to the index at 
each adjustment which might occur at six months or a year the 
resulting sum is then rounded to the nearest oneeighth percent 
some errors are likely to occur at this point but the 
possibilities for further errors are myriad some adjustments for 
example are limited up and down by caps that are written into the 
loan contracts 
hsh which has produced a booklet for homeowners wishing to 
check their arms lists a few of the other possibilities for error 
the servicer or company to which a borrower sends payments 
might select a monthly index value instead of a weekly one 
it might use the wrong date and thus the wrong index value 
an incorrect margin might be added to the index value in some 
cases the sum might not be rounded to the nearest oneeighth 
percent 
if the calculations are often too much for lenders and their 
computers how can a homeowner expect to do better the task is 
formidable to be sure and some people might automatically send 
the job to an accountant 
but say the folks at hsh it can be done by the homeowner with 
access to a newspaper and of course their handly little booklet 
and worksheet it is available for 3 from hsh associates 1200 
route 23 butler nj 07405 
theyll also calculate it for you if you tell them your current 
interest rate and send them a copy of your note rider or 
disclosure but itll cost you 25

after years of battling for control of 
the universe transformers those toy robots that can change form 
may have met their demise from sagging sales 
hasbro inc which made nearly 950 million selling transformers 
over the past seven years is reevaluating whether domestic demand 
is strong enough to justify costly promotion company spokesman 
wayne charness said tuesday 
certainly transformers had a fantastic run and we are going 
to review whether the run continues or whether it goes away he 
said 
hasbro kept the heroic autobots and the evil decepticons going 
for years by inventing and supplying weapons for both sides of the 
transformers battle it also developed a complicated story line of 
a futuristic mechanical being that crashlanded on earth in search 
of fuel and power supplies 
in its heyday in 1985 transformers generated about 333 million 
for hasbro accounting for 27 percent of the companys annual net 
revenue this year the product is expected to garner only about 
24 percent or 35 million 
hasbro worldwide net sales should total about 146 billion this 
year up from about 141 billion last year gary m jacobson toy 
industry analyst for kidder peabody amp co of new york told the 
providence journalbulletin 
charness said such staples as gi joe and cabbage patch kids 
dolls continue to be top sellers along with new items such as new 
kids on the block dolls and world wrestling federation figures 
transformers continue to sell well in other countries where the 
toys were introduced more recently charness said a decision on 
the future of transformers in this country should be made shortly 
he said 
with any product youd love to have it last forever and 
ever he said our job is to give it as long a life as it 
can 
if hasbro decides to discontinue us sales of transformers it 
will end one of the toy industrys biggest success stories in 
years 
it had a terrific run said paul h valentine a toy 
industry analyst at standard amp poors corp of new york it was 
one of the major hits of the 1980s 
another toy industry analyst sean mcgowan of gerard klauer 
mattison amp co of new york said the question of transformers is 
not why did it die but why did it live so long 
the answer lies at least in part in hasbros marketing 
strategy the pawtucketbased company constantly updated the line 
with new figures and vehicles it offered various models to appeal 
to different pocketbooks and there was a transformers television 
cartoon show and a movie 
over the years hasbro became less aggressive about marketing 
the figures 
we certainly continued to support transformers but not at the 
level we did when it was the most popular toy in the country 
charness said 
the line of toy robots first arrived in 1983 when it was 
unveiled at the annual toy fair in new york city by the japanese 
toy company takara 
while hasbro worked out a licensing arrangement with takara 
tonka corp of minnetonka minn introduced a competing line 
gobots in early 1984 
although transformers appeared five months after gobots 
hasbro came from behind and outsold gobots almost 2 to 1 
according to the book toyland the high stakes game of the toy 
industry 
transformers generated about 1116 million in sales that year 
i think it really brought a fun new play to toys said 
charness the whole transformation theme it was an exciting one 
for kids and i think done well it continues to be

general motors corp is planning to boost the 
number of dealerships owned by minority group members by 40 percent 
in three years and find ways to hang on to the 192 it already has 
the company said tuesday 
increased minority participation in our dealerships is vital 
to achieving gms prime objective of the 1990s satisfying car and 
truck owners said a statement by gm president lloyd reuss 
currently about 2 percent of gms 9600 dealers are members of 
minority groups including blacks hispanics and asians gm hopes 
to raise that number to 28 percent or 268 dealerships by 1993 
said the statement by reuss and tony march a buick dealer from 
hartford conn and chairman of the gm minority dealer advisory 
council 
about 57 percent of ford motor cos 5500 dealers are members 
of minority groups and about 25 percent of chrysler corps 5300 
dealers are from minority groups 
gm has had a dealer training program for minority groups since 
1972 but this is the first time a target has been set the goal 
was set friday when reuss and march signed an agreement 
there is no doubt in my mind about the commitment of lloyd 
reuss and gm chairman bob stempel march said we are talking 
about a commitment from the largest corporation in the world 
in addition to adding to the minority dealer ratio a steering 
committee of the dealer organizations will look at ways to help 
dealers from minority groups stay in business 
blackowned innercity dealerships are especially vulnerable to 
economic downturns such as the one the auto industry currently is 
experiencing 
in 1988 there were 114 blackowned gm dealerships a number 
that has shrunk to 83 lately four blackowned gm dealerships have 
folded in metropolitan detroit in the past year

shares in britains 12 regional electricity 
companies surged as much as 66 percent on their first day of 
trading tuesday prompting opponents to accuse the government of 
selling the industry off too cheaply 
prime minister john major rejected the charge and called the 
10 billion privatization the most popular in the governments 
decadeold program its also the biggest and most complex 
a package of 1000 of the 12 stocks jumped to 1578 pounds or 
3061 by the close of trading from an opening price of 1000 
pounds or 1940 
one companys shares manwebs soared to 166 pence or 324 
from its opening price of 100 pence or 194 the smallest gain 
by two companies was 42 pence or 81 cents 
frantic trading in the electricity shares almost trebled the 
london markets overall volume to 8255 million shares from 317 
million shares monday the exchange extended trading for 90 minutes 
to handle the heavy volume 
labor party leader neil kinnock accused the conservative 
government of selling a british asset at what he said was less than 
half its true value 
the british people are being subjected to a national scandal 
and by a great swindle by their own government he said in the 
house of commons any government that inflicts that on its own 
people is guilty either of infamous incompetence or of great 
dishonesty or both 
major disputed the charge saying the offer provided value to 
shareholders the offer has been a huge success clearly the most 
successful ever he said 
pricing a privatization is a tricky business the government 
tries to raise as much revenue as it can while pricing the shares 
cheaply enough to attract investors without creating a political 
storm 
the latest pricing was complicated by the uncertainty over the 
persian gulf crisis and generally bearish market conditions 
privatization shares generally have spurted on their first day 
of trading thats partly because underwriters insist that the 
shares be priced so that they get an instant 10 percent premium 
said john wilson an analyst with the london investment firm ubs 
phillips and drew 
theres no doubt about it the electricity shares are at the 
slightly high end of expectations wilson said but i certainly 
wouldnt say its been floated off cheaply 
the gains are not as large as they seem at first glance because 
they come on stock that is being bought with installment payments 
and because dealing costs have to be taken into account 
the shares were offered at 240 pence each or 466 payable in 
three installments the first 100 pence payment was due on 
application 
there was heightened demand for the shares however the sale of 
216 billion shares was more than 10 times oversubscribed 
prompting the government to scale back allocations to institutional 
investors 
tuesdays rise in prices reflected a scramble among those 
investors to get more stock analysts said 
at the same time some small investors were holding on to their 
stakes to take advantage of the governments enticements of 
electricity bill vouchers and dividends 
that meant demand far exceeded supply and market makers had to 
price the shares at levels high enough to entice institutional 
investors to sell

industrialist armand hammer was remembered 
tuesday as a tireless crusader for international peace who improved 
the human condition by investing millions in education medicine 
and the arts 
the flamboyant globetrotting chairman of occidental petroleum 
corp the nations 16th largest industrial company died monday at 
his home in the westwood district late monday following a brief 
illness he was 92 
the cause of death was not revealed although associates said 
privately hammer had been suffering from kidney problems he died 
just one day before a planned celebration for his belated bar 
mitzvah 
slammed by critics as a selfpromoter more concerned with his 
image than corporate leadership hammer nonetheless drew praise 
from heads of state and leaders in business and education he met 
with every soviet leader 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said hammer helped forge 
sovietamerican relations 
mr hammer was associated with one of the most remarkable 
pages of ur relationship gorbachev said he met with lenin 
and was very close in many ways to the soviet union and to 
russia 
hammer whose father helped found the american communist party 
became a millionaire by age 23 and by most estimates died a 
billionaire 
hammer bought the thenailing occidental for 100000 in 1957 as 
a tax shelter and turned it into an international giant it 1989 
income was 285 million on sales of 2007 billion occidentals 
core businesses are oil and gas chemicals natural gas pipelines 
pork and beef and coal 
ray r irani occidentals president and chief operating 
officer immediately succeeded hammer as chairman and chief 
executive 
but hammers death sparked speculation that occidental long 
beholden to his occasionally whimsical management style might 
change its corporate agenda 
warren shimmerlik an independent energy analyst said under 
iranis management occidental was likely to undergo significant 
restructuring 
hammers style prevented a rationalization that would be 
beneficial to the company shimmerlik said noting hammer 
preferred to position occidental as an incomeproducing stock 
rather than a growth company there didnt seem to be any real 
momentum in the company 
at times hammers craving for power and publicity threatened to 
overshadow his achievements in business philanthropy and the arts 
hammer exhibited a flair for the dramatic until the end of his 
life deciding to celebrate his jewish bar mitzvah manhood rite 
normally celebrated at age 13 at 92 
the ceremony set for tuesday night was changed into a memorial 
service 
were going to go ahead with the event event spokesman 
howard bragman said its really the wish of dr hammer that this 
event continue because it was important to him 
funeral arrangements were pending hammer will be entombed in 
the private hammer family mausoleum at westwood village cemetery 
just a few hundred yards from occidental petroleum headquarters and 
his new art museum 
hammer was born on may 21 1898 in new york city his 
russianborn father sent armand off at age 10 to live with a 
socialist colleague 
after world war i hammer went to columbia university college of 
physicians and surgeons working at night to bail out the familys 
struggling pharmaceutical firm he turned the business into a 
milliondollar company 
while waiting to begin his medical internship hammer read about 
a typhus epidemic in the new soviet union he went to russia where 
he quickly learned the soviets needed food more than doctors 
hammer told soviet officials ill bring over ships filled 
with grain if you will fill them with products i can sell in 
america 
during a life of wheeling and dealing he was on a firstname 
basis with world leaders from vladimir lenin to george bush 
he personally negotiated most of occidentals deals including a 
3 billion oil gas fertilizer and hotels pact with the soviets in 
1972 and a 640 million partnership with china in 1984 to develop 
the worlds largest openpit coal mine 
he made several fortunes and donated huge sums to charity the 
only reason i make money is so i can give it away hammer was 
fond of saying 
after the 1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster he helped american 
doctors go to the soviet union to help with bonemarrow 
transplants 
he was able to get a hold of people in moscow on a weekend and 
tell them that we were coming to help them said one of the 
surgeons dr robert gale he was a very good friend 
hammer flew one time prisoner of zion ida nudel from moscow 
to tel aviv in october 1987 and escorted ben charny who had a 
tumor in his neck from the soviet union to a boston hospital in 
july 1988 said rick jacobs occidental vice president and hammers 
personal assistant for more than seven years 
he was trusted by the soviet the american and the israeli 
leadership jacobs said

reagan named him chairman of the presidents cancer panel 
hammer also was an avid art collector his collection including 
works from five centuries of european paintings and a leonardo da 
vinci notebook is displayed at the armand hammer museum of art and 
culture which opened in november 1990 beside occidentals

of making a secret 54000 donation to the campaign of former 
president nixon 
he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges was fined 3000 and

the french national assembly adopted strict curbs 
tuesday on advertising for tobacco and alcoholic beverages over 
objections from winegrowers and sports promoters 
the assembly adopted a text worked out by a joint group of 
assembly deputies and members of the senate the approved text will 
now go to the upper chamber for consideration 
the law forbids all forms of direct or indirect tobacco 
advertising beginning jan 1 1993 and orders steep hikes in the 
price of cigarettes 
it is less severe on alcohol taking into account the concerns 
of senators from winegrowing regions who caused stiffer measures to 
be rejected in an earlier bill in october 
the revised version permits advertising in wineproducing 
regions in the written press aimed at adults and in certain radio 
broadcasts 
senators on the joint committee expressed confidence the 
proposal will pass their chamber later this month 
sponsorship by alcoholic beverage or tobacco companies in sports 
and other events will be strictly forbidden 
health minister claude evin who has pushed the advertising 
restrictions for a year calls such tobacco or alcohol sponsorship 
advertising in disguise 
the measures irritated jeanmarie balestre president of the 
international federation of auto sports the motor racing industry 
is heavily dependent on tobacco sponsorship 
there is too much hypocrisy in these measures he declared 
monday during an awards ceremony there are other much more 
dangerous scourges like drugs 
some deputies who voted against the bill tuesday remarked that 
the way to cure alcohol or tobacco abuse lay in better education 
others said it would cause unemployment in wineproducing areas 
evin says the law is necessary to bring down consumption of 
tobacco and alcohol by young french people and has praised the 
success of antitobacco campaigns in the united states

gold futures prices retreated tuesday on new yorks commodity 
exchange erasing most of the gains made in the previous days 
trading 
on other markets energy futures fell grains and soybean 
futures were mostly lower livestock and pork futures were mixed 
and coffee futures soared 
golds losses came on reports the german bundesbank would sell 1 
billion marks of gold to help finance reunification following the 
bundesbanks denial of the report the market rallied but fell as 
energy prices retreated 
john steel an analyst with refco inc in new york said the 
call before the start of trading tuesday was for gold to move 
higher in followthrough buying from mondays strong showing but 
the rumor of german selling put a damper on that 
the market jumped on the idea that the germans were going to 
sell gold steel said the story was flimsy anyone who knows 
about gold knows that governments seldom if ever sell their gold 
reserves 
also helping to push gold lower was the strength shown by the 
dollar against foreign currencies 
gold settled 210 to 230 lower with the contract for delivery 
in february at 37360 a troy ounce silver was 15 cents to 17 
cents lower with december at 4067 a troy ounce 
energy futures were lower in quiet trading on the new york 
mercantile exchange as traders consolidated their holdings in 
anticipation of the release of american petroleum institute 
inventory figures 
also sending the market lower was an announcement by venezuela 
that it plans to boost crude oil output by 44 percent over the next 
six years 
concern also existed in the market over what will come out of 
wednesdays scheduled organization of petroleum exporting countries 
meeting in vienna said ron caples an analyst with shearson lehman 
brothers inc in new york 
light sweet crude was 49 cents to 64 cents lower with january at

cubic feet 
grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower in lackluster 
trading on the chicago board of trade 
there was little news to spur trading as most were 
consolidating their holdings in anticipation of the release tuesday 
of the us agriculture departments supply and demand report 
traders also were awaiting soviet foreign minister eduard 
schevardnadzes visit to washington wednesday said dan cekander 
an analyst with rodman amp renshaw inc in chicago there is a belief 
the usda will use the occasion to announce the award of us aid or 
the granting of export credits to the soviets 
wheat futures while lower received some support from news that 
china has been targeted with 15 million metric tons of export 
bonus wheat 
wheat was 1 cents lower to 1 cents higher with the contract 
for delivery in december at 254 a bushel corn was a cent to 
1 cents higher with december at 227 a bushel oats were a 
cent lower to a cent higher with december at 110 a bushel 
soybeans were 1 cent lower to 1 cents higher with january at 
594 a bushel 
coffee futures soared on new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa 
exchange 
strong european demand for central american coffees coupled 
with those countries reluctance to sell helped boost prices 
also helping to lift prices is labor uncertainty in colombia 
workers at barranquilla cartagena santa marta and buenaventura 
are threatening to strike to protest government plans to privatize 
ports 
coffee was 180 cents to 260 cents higher with december at 91 
cents a pound

crude oil prices fell tuesday in light trading 
as concerns of overproduction by opec nations created some 
pessimism in the market 
traders said there was little news from the middle east to 
influence the market they said an unconfirmed british broadcast

initially sent prices lower 
light sweet crude oil for january delivery settled down 49 cents 
per barrel at 2641 later contract months for crude delivery also 
fell modestly 
crude was down as much as 128 a barrel in morning trading 
before rebounding traders attributed much of the gain to buying in 
order to pay back socalled short positions on borrowed 
contracts 
market professionals said traders are reluctant to stake out 
positions because they do not want to jeopardize reducing profits 
near the end of the year 
prices were affected in part by a call by irans oil minister on 
tuesday to cap opec production to help bolster prices 
in view of the situation in the oil markets at the moment i 
am worried about the production figure iranian oil minister 
gholamreza aqazadeh said before a meeting of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries in vienna 
a glut of crude oil would reduce prices on world markets 
if anything people are focusing a little bit more on 
reports that production levels are extremely high considering 
iraq and kuwait supplies arent in there said christian 
gohler a broker with merrill lynch energy futures its making 
people focus on potentially bearish fundamentals down the road 
futures prices for refined petroleum products also fell tuesday 
home heating oil futures tumbled 329 cents to 7768 cents a 
gallon on the january contract after rising 180 cents to 8097 
cents a gallon monday 
unleaded gasoline prices settled lower the contract for 
delivery in january declined 94 cent a gallon to 6679 cents after 
rising 126 cents monday 
the january contract for delivery of natural gas which is not 
directly affected by fears of war in the middle east dropped 70 
cent to 2285 per 1000 cubic feet after falling 50 cent monday 
after the market closed the american petroleum institute 
reported that us crude oil inventories fell moderately in the 
week ended friday to 3321 million barrels from 3355 million 
barrels the previous week a year ago domestic crude oil 
inventories totaled 3437 million barrels 
imports of crude oil fell to 48 million barrels a day from 49 
million a week earlier a year earlier before imports were 
affected by the gulf crisis they were 57 million barrels daily

ames department stores inc struggling 
to emerge from chapter 11 proceedings reported tuesday that is 
thirdquarter loss widened from a year earlier 
the discount retailer reported a loss of 1832 million 
attributed the poor results to restructuring charges of 129 
million and difficulty selling the leases for more than 200 stores 
it closed under its reorganization plan 
the loss which amounted to 497 a share compared to a 
restated loss of 16 million or 13 cents a share for the same 
period a year ago 
ames reported thirdquarter sales of 7402 million 92 percent 
lower than adjusted 1989 thirdquarter sales of 8383 million 
last years results did not include sales from the 221 stores 
ames closed after it filed for protection from its creditors in 
april 
the loss before the restructuring charge was much less than 
anticipated while sales exceeded our expectations stephen l 
pistner ames chief executive said in a statement thirdquarter 
results showed improvement as the stores merchandise levels began 
returning to normal and advertising was resumed and intensified 
a soft real estate market and tight credit resulted in lower 
than expected sales of leases for many of the stores that ames 
closed during the second quarter the retailer said 
pistner considered a whiz at turning around ailing retailers 
was hired to steer the company away from the brink of financial 
collapse 
ames filed for bankruptcy court protection from its creditors in 
april when sales at its 680 stores dropped by 40 percent in a 
3month period the company has closed more than 200 stores and 
consolidated some of its other operations 
pistner said ames was making progress in stabilizing its 
finances noting its seasonal borrowing was repaid ahead of 
schedule 
ames operates 461 discount department stores in 17 northeastern 
states 
for the first nine months of the fiscal year ames reported a 
loss of 7667 million or 2067 per share compared to a loss of 
292 million or 102 per share in the same period of 1989 
the 1990 results include 354 million in restructuring charges 
sales for the period totaled 216 billion compared to 339 
billion a year earlier the 1989 figure includes sales from the 
closed stores

the tobacco industry which manufactures 
billions of cigarettes a year said tuesday it wants to keep 
children from lighting up 
we want to protect children from making decisions that they 
are not capable of tobacco institute vice president brennan m 
dawson said at a news conference announcing a campaign to keep 
cigarettes away from anyone under 18 
if a child never picks up another cigarette it would be fine 
with the tobacco industry dawson said 
but health and human services secretary louis sullivan the bush 
administrations crusader against smoking said the industrys 
plans represent little more than a smoke screen to camouflage 
their own marketing activities 
the cigarette industry spent 33 billion in 1988 to advertise 
and promote cigarettes or about 100 per second sullivan said 
much of that advertising reaches young people and lures them into 
this deadly addiction 
dawson said the campaign would support state laws limiting 
cigarette sales to adults and would put new limitations on 
billboard and other tobacco advertising and distribute a parents 
guide on how to discourage children from smoking 
however she said the guidelines wont prevent cigarette 
companies from continuing to sponsor sporting events such as 
tennis tournaments 
dawson said she didnt know the cost of the program but said it 
was millions of dollars 
sullivan said the industry should stop advertising in newspapers 
and magazines that have a large readership of young people and stop 
targeting ads to young people women and minorities he also said 
tobacco companies should not sponsor sporting events and stop all 
free distribution of cigarettes 
fran du melle of the american lung association who represented 
a coalition that includes the american heart association and the 
american cancer society called the program just another public 
relations effort to head off congressional consideration of 
meaningful and effective legislation to regulate what has proven 
itself to be an irresponsible industry 
she said the industry action would not curtail marketing tactics 
targeted at children 
once again the tobacco industry seeks to mislead the public 
about its intentions by putting forward a package of reforms which 
dont go far enough to have a meaningful impact du melle said 
these proposals cant withstand the most minimal scrutiny 
another antismoking group action on smoking or health said 
there already are local government efforts under way to curtain 
sales of cigarettes to minors and that the tobacco industry 
campaign is simply making a virtue of necessity 
i dont think anything the tobacco industry does will ever 
satisfy our critics dawson said when asked if the industry was 
trying to avoid federal legislation 
the campaign was kicked off at a news conference that included 
educators who said they endorsed the effort the educators also 
said they were being paid for their appearance 
dawson said the new industry advertising guidelines would forbid 
cigarette advertising on billboards less than 500 feet from schools 
or playgrounds clothing with cigarette brand names would be made 
only in large sizes and mailed tobacco promotions would require a 
statement that the recipient is 21 or older she said 
asked about paid product placements in popular movies dawson 
said the practice would be stopped cigarette companies have paid 
movie producers to feature their brand name prominently among the 
props used in films 
dawson said the tobacco lobby would actively support legislation 
in states that permit cigarette sales to those under age 18 
the district of columbia and 11 states delaware georgia 
kentucky louisiana missouri montana new mexico north carolina 
vermont virginia and wyoming that either have no laws regarding 
sales to minors or permit children as young as 16 to buy the 
product 
she said the effort also would include distributing signs and 
buttons to retailers about tobacco sales to minors and a series of 
advertisements in national magazines and newspapers explaining the 
industry program

the federal deposit insurance corp voted 
tuesday to tighten rules that affect banks and savings institutions 
devoting a large part of their business to collecting mortgage 
payments 
the board of the agency voted 40 to allow no more than 50 
percent of an institutions capital to be made up of the collection 
contracts known as mortgageservicing rights 
the office of the comptroller of the currency which regulates 
nationallychartered banks already has an even stricter limit 25 
percent but statechartered banks and sampls had no limit 
the sampl bailout law enacted in august 1989 required regulators 
to come up with a rule on the mortgageservicing rights they had 
been debating it since february 
the issue was whether the value of the servicing contracts was 
too risky to count as capital which represents the owners 
investment in a financial institution and acts as a lossabsorbing 
buffer protecting government deposit insurance funds 
mortgageservicing rights are bought and sold among financial 
institutions after purchasing the right institutions can then 
earn a steady stream of fees for collecting monthly payments they 
forward the payments to the actual owners of the mortgages often a 
secondary mortgage company such as freddie mac and fannie mae 
however there is a risk if interest rates drop and homeowners 
refinance their loans the old mortgages and the value of the 
right to service them disappear

media giant times mirror inc said tuesday it 
plans to boost advertising rates and reduce capital spending next 
year as it adjusts to the most severe advertising slump in more 
than a decade 
the diversified media company which publishes the los angeles 
times and seven east coast newspapers is also trying to cut costs 
with hiring freezes or layoffs in some divisions foregoing a 
dividend increase for the first time since 1983 and swearing off 
major acquisitions 
chairman and chief executive robert f erburu said the ad slump 
that has spread from the northeast to the west coast has 
deteriorated further in the fourth quarter and is expected to last 
into the new year 
but he said the main reason for the ad slowdown has been a 
cyclical decline in the economy he said the steps times mirror has 
taken to cut costs will enable it to rebound when the economy 
improves 
in addition to its newspaper holdings los angelesbased times 
mirror owns four networkaffiliated television stations publishes 
magazines and books and has interests in cable television systems 
erburu told the annual painewebber media outlook conference that 
the companys businesses that are not dependent on advertising such 
as professional infrmation book publishing and cable operations 
are showing healthy growth 
but he said the companys overall performance likely will 
continue to be weakened by the impact of the ad slump on the 
companys other businesses 
he did not provide specific earnings estimates and a 
spokeswoman said the company traditionally does not make such 
forecasts 
another californiabased media company mcclatchy newspapers 
inc said its operating results this year should about match last 
year and may improve next year 
erwin potts president and chief executive said the company is 
better off than some other media companies because its 19 
newspapers are located in cities that have withstood the economic 
slump such as sacramento and modesto calif 
to one degree or another we are all singing the blues but 
im not going to join that chorus he said 
on monday media spending forecaster robert coen of the ad 
agency mccannerickson said us ad spending would be up 49 
percent this year its slowest advance since 1975 and would rise 
only 46 percent in 1991 
the slowdown coen said is having its most pronounced effect on 
newspapers that are seeing big declines in classified advertising 
and only slow growth in spending by local retail advertisers 
david laventhol chief operating officer at times mirror and 
publisher and chief executive at the los angeles times said the 
times plans to boost its ad rates by 7 percent to 9 percent in 
january 
rates at the east coast newspapers which include newsday new 
york newsday and the baltimore sun will rise by 6 percent to 8 
percent next year he said 
laventhol said new york newsday has seen circulation rise since 
the strike oct 25 at the daily news in new york the daily news 
has continued to publish but has had difficulty distributing the 
paper 
new york newsdays circulation is up by about 110000 daily to 
335000 and by 225000 on sunday to 380000 laventhol said 
the combined sunday circulation of new york newsday and newsday 
on long island surpassed 1 million this past sunday for the first 
time he said 
erburu said ad rates at times mirror magazines would be 
increased 3 percent to 9 percent next year its titles include 
field amp stream popular science and home mechanix 
times mirror is reducing its capital spending to under 350 
million in 1990 and to under 300 million in 1991 compared with 
420 million in 1989 he said 
he said he doesnt expect any significant expenditure in the 
acquisition area next year 
erburu also noted that the company recently announced it was 
holding its dividend at 108 a share for 1991 the first year 
since 1983 that it has not raised the payout 
james p smith vice president of finance and treasurer at 
sacramentobased mcclatchy said he was comfortable with analysts 
estimates of 1990 earnings of 88 cents to 95 cents a share down 
from 119 a share in 1989 
potts said 1990 operating results should be about even with 1989 
when extraordinary items such as the debt incurred in buying three 
newspapers in south carolina and investment in a new newsprint mill 
company are excluded 
he said mcclatchy will do a little better in 1991 mainly 
because the classified advertising revenues are showing strength in 
its markets while other newspaper groups are showing sharp 
declines 
smith said revenues should grow 7 percent to 8 percent while 
operating expenses including an expected newsprint price hike and 
labor costs will go up by 7 percent to 9 percent but nonoperating 
expenses should be down 25 percent to 35 percent he said 
potts said the company is not seeking any acquisitions although 
it has been approached by wouldbe sellers he described the 
companys strategy on acquisitions as opportunistic however

the equitable the nations thirdlargest life 
insurer said tuesday it will convert from a mutual company to one 
owned by stockholders so that it can more easily bolster its 
troubled finances 
the equitable with more than 135 billion in assets would 
become the largest insurer to take such a step the company said 
by converting from a mutual company owned by its policyholders 
to a stockholder company the equitable will be able to raise funds 
by selling shares to investors 
james guenther an insurance industry analyst at the chicago 
investment firm duff amp phelps said that as a mutual company the 
equitables options for raising additional funds are limited to 
selling forms of debt instruments such as bonds 
you cant raise equity capital through selling shares which 
regulators want to see he said debt is debt its something 
that has to be paid back 
the equitable suffers from declining values in its real estate 
investments losses in its large portfolio of highrisk junk bonds 
and problems with its mortgage loans analysts said 
late last month rumors swept the financial markets that the 
equitable had missed a payment on its bonds and was near 
insolvency the company denied the rumors 
i dont think its a solvency question said michael 
frinquelli an insurance industry analyst at salomon brothers inc 
but clearly they would like to have more capital if for no other 
reason than to enable them to grow faster 
he said the equitables ability to write additional insurance 
policies is limited by the size of its capital 
standard amp poors corp a major creditrating agency predicted 
the insurance company will take large writeoffs for its troubled 
investments which may cause a significant loss for the year and 
reduce the companys capital 
sampp added that the equitables greater investment in junk bonds 
than other life insurers and its large mortgage loan portfolio 
indicates a potential for additional future investmentrelated 
losses given the current outlook in the economy in general and 
investment markets in particular 
sampp said the equitable is already more thinly capitalized than 
its peers the ratings agency lowered by one notch its ratings on 
the equitables ability to pay policyholder claims 
sampp said equitables announcement that it will convert to a 
stockholder company indicates that the company recognizes its 
need to seek significant external capital 
the equitable said the conversion to a stockholder company could 
take up to 18 months most of its 3 million policyholders would 
receive payments in the form of cash or stock in the equitable the 
insurer said adding it was too soon to say how large the payouts 
would be 
these shares will become marketable and in some cases will 
represent important additional value to these shareholders said 
richard h jenrette the equitables chairman and chief executive 
officer 
the conversion is allowed under a 1988 new york state law that 
is similar to other demutualization laws enacted in others states 
in recent years 
in an interview jenrette said the principal reason for 
demutualizing is to give the company more flexibility in raising 
capital but he denied that the equitable was in trouble 
the company is not in any jeopardy we are in strong financial 
shape he said 
another reason for demutualization he said is that it would 
give the company more flexibility as the financial services 
industry is deregulated as a mutual company the equitable cannot 
participate in transactions with shareholderowned companies 
due to the length of the conversion process he said the company 
may seek longterm private investors who in the meantime would 
purchase notes that could be converted into stock when the 
conversion is completed 
the equitable already has been in contact with several potential 
investors jenrette said declining to identify them 
frinquelli the salomon analyst speculated that japanese or 
european companies may be interested in taking a stake in the 
equitable to gain a foothold in the us insurance market jenrette 
said foreign investors were among those he has contacted 
the demutualization must be approved by state regulators and 
certain classes of policyholders 
the equitable started as a stock company in 1859 it was 
converted to a mutual company in 1918 under a plan devised by jp 
morgan amp co 
among its divisions is the stock brokerage donaldson lufkin amp 
jenrette inc which was cofounded by jenrette the equitable 
bought the brokerage in 1985 
the last insurance company of any size to demutualize was union 
mutual of portland maine which converted to a stockholder company 
in 1986 and now is called unum corp frinquelli said 
frinquelli added that if the equitable conversion is successful 
it could be the start of a trend

will get what from the troubled trump empire and whether the 
couples marital agreement giving the donald the lions share will 
hold

phyllis gangeljacob 
while mrs trump said through her attorney she would have no 
further comment on the matter her exhusband issued a statement of 
good will 
i wish ivana the best i have no doubt that she will do very 
well in the years to come said trump 
but whether mrs trump will do it with a reported 25 million 
prenuptial agreement or with much more remains to be seen the 
judge said all other money matters such as child support equitable 
distribution of property and the validity of any pre and 
postmarital agreement will be decided at an april 11 hearing 
unless they are otherwise resolved

mrs trump argued in court papers that the couples updated 
marital agreement signed in december 1987 was drawn up while her 
husband was already committing adultery and intended to leave her 
in granting the divorce gangeljacob said trumps cruel and 
inhuman treatment made it improper for the couple to remain 
married the judge did not elaborate

prejudice which means it cannot be brought up again 
mesa will pay about 80 percent of the amount the settlement 
stipulates that the defendants make the payment without conceding 
guilt or wrongdoing 
in december 1984 mesa offered 60 a share in cash for up to 23 
million of phillips 1546 million outstanding common shares mesa 
was considering further shareholder enticements when it dropped the 
bid in an agreement with phillips which is based in bartlesville 
okla 
under the agreement mesa said it would sell back its 89 
million shares of phillips stock to the company for 53 a share in 
cash giving mesa a pretax profit of 89 million 
such a circumstance is sometimes considered greenmail in 
which a party threatens a takeover but profits by forcing the 
company to buy back its stock at a premium 
holders of phillips shares between dec 5 and dec 21 1984 
formed the class of plaintiffs in the suit

pullout 
concepcions office received word of the pullout in a letter 
from anthony chong chairman of the taiwanese firm on monday 
in taipei usi far east spokesman lin yunteng confirmed the 
company has decided to withdraw

political reasons the petrochemical project is good for the 
industry and the philippine people lin said 
he said fighting between different political factions in the 
philippines led to the decision 
concepcion strongly supported the project saying it was crucial 
in building a petrochemical industry in a country struggling to 
cope with energy shortages but critics charged concepcion and 
others had been too generous in its financing arrangements 
the project became a major political controversy underscoring 
differences on investment policy within the aquino government
