if youve been waiting for something that only 
happens once in a blue moon its time 
the second full moon in the same month known in folklore as a 
blue moon will occur at 653 am edt tuesday according to 
the experts at the us naval observatory in washington a full 
moon also occurred may 1 
the term is applied because of the rarity of the situation the 
moon does not necessarily appear blue 
as seen from earth the time between one full moon and the next 
is 29 days a span called the moons synodic period 
this means that technically two full moons could occur in any 
month except february the occasion happens rarely however only 
about once every two to three years 
some folks including meteorologists contend that the term 
blue moon should apply to occasions when the moon takes on a 
blue coloration this can happen when small particles in the 
atmosphere inferfere with light causing the bluish tint 
the particles can come from such sources as forest fires and 
volcanic eruptions this too is a rare happening about once in 
a blue moon

twelveyearold vera zeiman an orphan annie 
lookalike with cherubic cheeks and frizzy curls has been waiting 
nearly all her life to leave the soviet union on sunday she 
waited in vain for president reagan 
reagan had considered a private visit to vera and her jewish 
refusenik parents but us sources said the dropin was scrubbed 
after word filtered to white house planners it could hurt the 
zeimans chance to emigrate 
knowing they had no guarantee but unaware things had changed 
the zeimans prepared for a presidential visit vera and her mother 
tanya put on their best dresses baked a honey cake and tidied 
their tiny threeroom apartment 
outside about 300 local residents gaped at a swarm of soviet 
police presence the fresh paint on the zeimans apartment house 
and newly raked flower beds nearby they waited around since 
something unusual certainly seemed in the offing 
when we started to apply to emigrate i thought it would not 
be easy for us sighed tanya as she gazed at the crowd on the 
street the one thing i didnt want to attract is publicity the 
mob like this 
a us official who asked not to be identified said white house 
planners scrubbed consideration of a zieman visit after the soviets 
passed word that the ziemans would never leave the country if 
reagan went to their home 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater denied sunday there ever 
were definite plans for the zieman visit saying only that a number 
of sites were scouted for potential reagan trips 
the ziemans moscow jews who first sought to emigrate in 1977 
are among the refuseniks invited to meet reagan monday afternoon at 
spaso house the us ambassadors residence where he is staying 
while in moscow 
the president and his wife nancy reportedly have taken a special 
interest in their case since vera who calls herself a lifelong 
refusenik wrote to the reagans april 4 asking for help 
a white house official roman popadiuk told reporters that 
reagan on sunday gave gorbachev a list of 14 cases of refuseniks 
divided spouses and consular matters the united states wants 
resolved the presentation of such lists has become a regular part 
of highlevel meetings between us and soviet officials 
several dozen jews known as refuseniks because they have 
been refused permission to emigrate and thousands of newer jewish 
german and armenian emigres have received exit visas in recent 
months 
but us officials say at least 2000 soviet jews still have 
applications pending and human rights issues in general remain a 
contentious issue for the fiveday summit between reagan and 
mikhail s gorbachev 
like many other refuseniks the ziemans are denied permission to 
emigrate on grounds of alleged danger to state security 
after the ziemans applied to emigrate tanya lost her job as an 
english professor and yuri lost his as an advanced computer 
specialist working as a hospital plumber until ill health forced 
him to stop last fall 
their elder daughter galya got out of the soviet union last 
year apparently because authorities did not realize from her 
married name of khatutsky that she was a member of the zieman 
family she now lives in boston mass campaigning for her 
familys emigration 
yuri has been suffering from hepatitis and an undiagnosed 
condition that gives him double vision and knows a cure 
the best medicine i need now is a visa he joked sunday 
it will treat me and it will be the greatest achievement of 
soviet medicine 
the first hint of a reagan visit to the ziemans came when us 
scouting officials visited their home last week 
a few days later the soviets apparently got wind of the 
tentative plan and started cleaning up the ziemans neighborhood 
but the people hoping to catch a glimpse of the first american 
president to visit moscow since 1972 were skeptical nothing would 
happen even when a police car drove past blaring nothing will 
happen here today from a loudspeaker 
thats perestroika for you yelled one local referring to 
gorbachevs restructuring reforms they dont tell you anything

west german officials say they do not 
think a remedy will quickly be found for a viral infection that has 
killed more than 300 north sea seals this month 
the seals have been infected by what some scientists think is a 
herpes virus since the beginning of may 306 seals were found dead 
on the danish coast and another 30 on this north sea island 
scientists from denmark west germany and the netherlands plan 
to meet this week in kiel west germany to attempt to determine 
what is killing the seals 
several west german scientists who have examined the remains of 
some seals said on national television that the animals died of 
apparent pneumonia 
environment minister klaus toepfer visited sylt on sunday and 
told reporters there is little authorities can now do to save the 
seals he said that whatever is killing the seals does not seem to 
stem directly from the growing amount of industrial waste in the 
north sea

a white house spokesman said he expects the red 
army to complete its withdrawal from afghanistan despite soviet 
warnings that the continued shipment of usbought weapons to 
anticommunist guerrillas there jeopardizes the pullout 
for three days the soviets have been complaining that the 
united states and pakistan have been sending aid to the 
anticommunist mujahedeen guerrillas of afghanistan in violation of 
the geneva accords under which the red army is being withdrawn 
its our attitude that the agreement was signed and the soviet 
union entered into it and said it would pull its troops out 
spokesman marlin fitzwater told a news conference on sunday the 
opening day of the moscow summit 
said gennady gerasimov the soviet foreign ministry spokesman 
according to a treaty signed between pakistan and afghanistan 
both these countries have taken upon themselves the commitment not 
to interfere in the others internal affairs 
but from the last facts we know that massive transportation 
transfer of armaments from pakistan to afghanistan of course 
brings us concern said gerasimov appearing at the same news 
conference as fitzwater after sundays summit meeting between 
president reagan and kremlin leader mikhail gorbachev 
earlier the kremlin hinted that the arms shipments might slow 
the withdrawal of the estimated 105500 soviet troops remaining in 
afghanistan 
a statement from the soviet ministry carried by the tass news 
agency on saturday and the newspaper pravda on sunday said moscow 
would draw pertinent conclusions with respect to the timetable of 
the troops withdrawal and take concrete steps called for by the 
illicit actions of islamabad the capital of pakistan 
the foreign ministry statement did not mention the united states 
by name however on saturday and aide to gorbachev leveled the 
accusation directly at washington 
yevgeny primakov who is head of the institute on world economy 
and international relations and has advised gorbachev on 
afghanistan told a presummit news conference on friday that the 
americans were arming quite openly those who wish to go on in the 
civil war 
fitzwater said that the soviet pullout has started and i 
assume that everyone knew the rules at the signing of the agreement 
and that the pullout will continue 
besides the main geneva accord signed by the afghan and 
pakistan governments the united states and soviet union exchanged 
letters saying that they would continue sending aid to their afghan 
allies as long as the other did the same 
the soviets reportedly have turned over to the afghan regime 
massive caches of arms as well as entire military bases as the red 
army withdraws 
the united states reportedly sends the afghan guerrillas arms 
and aid worth about 500 million a year but american officials do 
not discuss the program openly

after 12 years as a guerrilla 
fighter cherif hassana put his turban on the end of his rifle and 
surrendered to moroccan soldiers bachir hammed slipped away from a 
guerrillasponsored soccer team during an overseas tour 
with the declining fortunes of the marxistled polisario 
independence movement in the western sahara more and more 
guerrillas are deserting the movement and drifting back across the 
desert to join the moroccan side 
moroccan officials say the deserters are arriving at an average 
rate of about 10 a week 
a group of foreign reporters met many of them on a recent 
governmentsponsored tour of the moroccanannexed western sahara 
usually talking in the presence of moroccan officials they 
painted a grim picture of conditions in refugee and guerrilla camps 
in the polisario fronts algerian sanctuaries 
the algerianbacked polisario front claims that more than 
165000 refugees are living in tent camps around the algerian oasis 
of tindouf after fleeing moroccan oppression the moroccans say 
about twothirds of the refugees are not even from the disputed 
territory 
all deserters interviewed had fled before may 16 when algeria 
and morocco made their surprise announcement of resumed diplomatic 
relations after hovering on the brink of war over the sahara for 
more than 12 years 
several said the polisario must have felt the announcement like 
a stab in the back from algeria 
it must have been a terrible shock said cherif hassana 35 
who fought in the polisarios ranks for 12 years rising to the 
rank of major and deputy company commander among the estimated 
8000 guerrillas 
for all these years the algerians promised they would never 
establish relations with morocco until the sahara had become 
independent 
like many other deserters hassana claimed he was recruited by 
force in 1975 at the end of spanish colonial rule in the western 
sahara he previously served as an enlisted man in the spanish 
colonial army 
i was on leave in my familys tent in the desert he said 
polisario men came in landrovers and grabbed me 
he said he gradually became disillusioned and began looking for 
opportunities to escape 
it was not easy he said we were all under constant 
supervision even the officers many who tried to escape were 
killed by their own units or by the mines in the desert 
he said he managed to get away in a vehicle while on patrol near 
moroccos 1500mile defensive wall 
i put my turban on the end of my rifle as a sign of 
surrender hassana said 
bachir hammed 23 was sent to france as captain of a polisario 
soccer team purporting to represent hawza a desert settlement 100 
miles inside the moroccan wall 
hawza has been under moroccan control for more than five years 
but the team was welcomed to french cities with communistled city 
councils eager to promote the polisario hammed said 
he slipped away while passing through paris and took a taxi to 
the moroccan embassy 
most of us realized long ago that polisario is losing the 
war said abderrahman kharbouch 32 a guerrilla platoon 
commander who fled across the desert but everyone is afraid and 
tends to keep his feelings to himself 
the highest ranking deserter to reach moroccan lines thus far is 
mohamed ramdan 34 former deputy chief of the polisario diplomatic 
mission to the organization of african unity the oau has 
recognized the polisario as a fullranking member 
fadli rguibi 38 walked across the moroccan border near figuig 
under cover of darkness now a moroccan soldier his only regret is 
that he had to leave his wife and daughter behind in algeria the 
wife he said will probably be forced to marry someone else 
the polisario leadership insists that all men must have two or 
three wives because so many men got killed and they want to keep up 
the birthrate he said 
numerous deserters claimed that wives of deserters or men killed 
in battle were forcibly married to other polisario men 
boucheiba buchara 38 said he had to leave his wife and two 
sons in the camps 
god know what happened to them he said im sure if i 
ever meet my wife again she will be married to someone else 
in paris polisarios chief representative in europe mohamed 
sidati said such claims are a monstrous lie of moroccan 
propaganda 
but he said islamic law allows a deserted wife to take a new 
husband after a waiting period of four months

with little more than a week remaining in 
the democratic primary season jesse jackson was urging followers 
to never forget this campaign and reminding them that life 
goes on when the race is over 
jackson was campaigning sunday in new jersey where polls 
indicate he trails democratic frontrunner michael dukakis in next 
weeks primary race jackson also lags far behind in the national 
delegate count 
but jackson said his campaign themes have become part of the 
national agenda and that he is helping to chart the course of the 
democratic party he also said the other candidates both dukakis 
and republican george bush had incorporated his ideas into their 
own campaigns 
when bush is fighting against drugs jesse jackson is 
winning every day he said 
california montana and new mexico hold primaries on june 7 
along with new jersey as he campaigned here jackson was already 
looking beyond the outcome of those races 
when the race is over june 7 life goes on june 8 jackson 
said we should never forget this campaign 
at a labor rally at john f kennedy high school jackson drew a 
crowd of 1500 who packed a stuffy auditorium where the 
temperatures were well into the 90s jackson renewed his call for a 
higher minimum wage and equal compensation for women workers 
something has gone awry profits are up wages are down 
plants are closing workers are working more and more and making 
less and less he said to cheers 
at a news conference in paterson nj jackson said his staff 
had been frequently conferring with the dukakis campaign 
both of us have certainly earned the right to each others 
consideration jackson said and were doing that with 
enthusiasm together were gonna win 
in recent days jackson has been making foreign policy and 
domestic policy statements indicating he hopes to see them become 
part of the democratic platform last week in california he 
released a fiveyear budget plan calling for a freeze in military 
spending 
also in california he sought to persuade dukakis to agree that 
south africa should be declared a terrorist state dukakis

the most rev james a hickey archbishop of 
the nations capital says he was truly honored very humbled and 
deeply grateful to be named a cardinal in the roman catholic 
church 
hickey and detroit archbishop edmund c szoka were among 25 
church leaders the vatican announced sunday would be added to the 
college of cardinals they are to be installed on june 29 hickey 
will remain leader of the washingtonarea diocese 
in the years remaining for me i shall strive to be a caring 
pastor a faithful teacher a loving father and brother and a true 
servant of the people of god in the district of columbia and the 
five counties of maryland hickey said 
i am truly honored very humbled and deeply grateful that our 
holy father pope john paul ii has chosen me to serve as a 
cardinal of the church he said in a prepared statement 
hickey 67 has become a key figure in dealing with the us 
government on issues affecting the church in central america two 
of four nuns murdered in el salvador in 1980 had been under his 
jurisdiction as bishop of cleveland 
he had earlier ridden in the van in which they were murdered 
also in 1980 he attended the tumultuous funeral of his friend 
assassinated salvadoran archbishop oscar romero 
hickey was described by the washington magazine regardies 
in 1985 as washingtons most unlikely power broker and one of a 
few catholic churchmen who are determined to make their church more 
a part of the real world 
the magazine said hickey has lobbied for increased spending to 
aid the poor tried to convince members of congress to stop giving 
aid to the nicaraguan contras and pushed for catholic bishops to 
take strong stands in favor of nuclear disarmament and against 
increased military spending 
hickey is often described as a conservative on church issues 
but publicly expressed compassion last year when a catholic priest 
in his diocese died of aids 
hickey said he encouraged the rev michael r peterson to 
disclose the nature of his illness but never asked the priest how 
he contracted the disease which is transmitted through intimate 
sexual contact infected needles used in illegal drug use or 
contaminated blood transfusions 
the archbishop said he wanted to demonstrate that compassion for 
aids patients is as much a part of church teaching as its rejection 
of homosexual relations 
hickey born in midland mich was ordained a priest in saginaw 
in 1946 and organized a ministry to spanishspeaking migrants who 
came to michigan to work each year 
he also has had extensive church experience in rome earning a 
doctorate in canon law at pontifical lateran university and a 
doctorate in theology at pontifical angelicum university before 
returning to work as secretary to the bishop of saginaw for nine 
years 
he became a bishop in 1967 and rector of the pontifical north 
american college in rome in 1969 and was also president of the 
association of roman seminary rectors 
hickey became bishop of cleveland in 1974 participating with 
other religious leaders in a demonstration supporting courtordered 
busing of black students to achieve racial balance in public 
schools 
hickey has been bishop of washington for eight years the 
archdiocese includes 131 catholic parishes with about 400000 
church members in the district of columbia and montgomery prince 
georges calvert charles and st marys counties in maryland 
as washington archbishop hickey is also chancellor of the 
catholic university of america and chairman of the board of 
trustees of the national shrine of the immaculate conception in 
washington 
since 1979 he has been chairman of the national conference of 
catholic bishops committee on doctrine

a former morton thiokol engineer who 
argued against launching the space shuttle challenger says he has 
stopped blaming himself for the explosion that killed its seven 
astronauts and is ready to go back to work 
after two years of therapy and the positive catharsis of 
lectures on the disaster roger boisjoly is seeking to reclaim the 
career that was shattered when the challenger blew up 
for a long time i bore the burden of guilt because i hadnt 
done more to stop it he said last week but ive resolved it 
now i did everything i could 
like several other engineers with rocket manufacturer morton 
thiokol boisjoly argued fiercely the night before the jan 28 
1986 launch that temperatures of 53 degrees fahrenheit or lower 
could result in a failure of a rocket joint seal endangering the 
shuttle and crew 
but after a second caucus with officials of the national 
aeronautics and space administration boisjoly said company 
managers perceived pressure from nasa i felt the pressure 
others felt the pressure 
boisjoly and others at morton thiokols utah plant watched on 
television as the shuttle rising above cape canaveral after a 
night of freezing temperatures blew apart 73 seconds after liftoff 
after testifying before the presidential commission that 
investigated the disaster he felt ostracized by morton thiokol on 
july 21 1986 boisjoly took disability leave he quit the 
following september 
he was diagnosed as suffering from posttraumatic stress 
syndrome 
with his disability benefits from morton thiokol due to run out 
by years end boisjoly plans to use his remaining time and income 
to get my life back together 
because hes 50 and unemployed boisjoly said getting a new job 
is not going to be a cakewalk 
boisjoly said he probably will return to engineering although 
not in the aerospace business a tampa company tentatively offered 
a job after a lecture at the university of southern florida 
he declined to talk about the therapy he underwent instead 
boisjoly spoke about his recent series of lectures at colleges and 
professional societies where he recounts challengerrelated events 
from jan 25 1986 until now 
i dwell on the final chart the decisionmaking chart that 
came out of the caucus theres not a single statement on the chart 
that supports the launch he said thats when my audience just 
looks horrified they cant believe anybody would launch 
a mechanical engineer boisjoly had been in aerospace for 27 
years six at morton thiokol before resigning 
i saw the industry get broken over 20 years weve gone from 
companies considering employees as an asset to considering them 
replaceable parts based on the bottom line of maximum 
shortterm profits he said its the forcedmarch approach to 
management it simply doesnt work it leads to decisions based on 
money and schedules 
boisjoly has little faith in the redesigned rocket booster to be 
used in the launch of the shuttle discovery scheduled for august 
i think the pressures are worse now he said they give 
the appearance of returning to safe flight but theyre still 
trying to return to schedule and thats coming from top 
management 
morton thiokol officials declined comment on boisjolys 
assertions 
still pending is a pair of lawsuits boisjoly filed against 
morton thiokol 
one seeks 1 billion for the seven astronauts deaths and 1 
million in compensatory damages for his own health and career the 
other filed on behalf of us taxpayers seeks 2075 billion and 
alleges that morton thiokol knowingly provided nasa with defective 
solid rocket motors 
the lawsuits said his attorney robert levin are boisjolys 
way of trying to make sense of and extract some good from a 
terrible tragedy its very important to him that the right lessons 
be learned from what happened with challenger 
said boisjoly im asked in my talks if id do it again id 
do it again in a minute whats right is right and this was a 
clearcut case of whats wrong

a scientist detected electrical changes in 
the ground before a killer earthquake jolted los angeles last year 
but he and other researchers remain skeptical that such phenomena 
can be used to predict temblors 
the electrical signals measured by massachusetts institute of 
technology geophysicist theodore madden are smaller than those 
detected in greece by scientists who claimed they used their 
measurements to successfully predict strong earthquakes beneath the 
ionian sea on may 18 and 22 
many seismologists have been skeptical of the greek claims and 
of any link between quakes and variations in underground electrical 
voltages 
but madden is highly respected and his findings will spur 
scientists to consider carefully the usefulness of electrical 
changes in predicting quakes said don anderson seismology 
laboratory director at the california institute of technology in 
pasadena 
the technique is unproven but im not going to naysay 
anything ted madden does said allan lindh a us geological 
survey scientist researching earthquake prediction madden is one 
of the smartest guys ive ever met in my life electrical 
experiments done by madden are in a different class than those by 
anyone else in the world 
madden remains unconvinced by his own observations he said it 
may be pure coincidence that there were changes in underground 
electrical signals starting about two months before the 
59magnitude whittier narrows quake rocked the los angeles area 
last oct 1 measured on the richter scale the quake was just 
under the 6point mark considered a severe shock 
madden said the changes peaked one week after the quake which 
with its aftershocks killed eight people injured more than 200 
and caused 358 million in damage 
at the moment i dont know if it will prove to be of any 
significance for earthquake prediction he said last week by 
phone from cambridge mass 
madden to measure electrical changes rented six pacific bell 
telephone lines up to 30 miles long on both sides of the san 
gabriel mountains north of los angeles 
he attached copper pipes to the ends of the lines and buried the 
pipes making the lines into antennas that detected two kinds of 
electrical changes in the ground before the october quake 
the first more significant change was in the earths 
selfpotential a voltage that scientists believe is generated 
when underground water is squeezed out of pores in rocks changes 
in underground stresses before a quake may cause such squeezing 
madden said 
the other much more subtle change occurred in resistivity 
which indicates how resistant rock is to the movement of electrical 
currents created naturally by earths magnetic field scientists 
theorize that stresses leading to quakes cause changes in 
resistivity 
although the data were analyzed after the fact and were not 
certain enough to have predicted the earthquake the correlation 
was tantalizing said an article in the may issue of spectrum 
published by the institute of electrical and electronics engineers 
maddens findings are very intriguing yet he is cautious 
about claiming the method might be used to predict quakes because 
hes probably been one of his own strongest critics said 
geophysicist stephen park a former madden student now working at 
the university of california riverside 
park said he is using a similar method to watch for electrical 
changes along the san andreas fault near parkfield where the usgs 
predicts a quake measuring about 6 on the richter scale is likely 
to occur by early 1993 
such quakes rock parkfield roughly every 22 years so scientists 
have installed hundreds of instruments in an attempt to predict the 
next jolt a few days before it occurs said lindh who heads the 
project 
madden is skeptical of his findings because he detected the 
electrical changes near palmdale castaic placerita canyon 
sunland and azusa places 15 to 50 miles north of the epicenter of 
the october quake he used phone lines only in those locations 
because he was watching for electrical changes along the san 
andreas not along the unmapped fault that caused the october jolt 
madden said it is possible the electrical variations were caused 
by changes in groundwater runoff from the nearby san gabriel 
mountains and not by prequake stresses in the earth 
but anderson said a respected japanese geophysicist s uyeda 
also has studied the possibility of predicting quakes based on 
electrical voltage changes and is convinced there is some merit 
in the method

the rev edmund c szoka named to the college of 
cardinals of the roman catholic church says his promotion reflects 
more favorably on the archdiocese of detroit than on himself 
szoka 60 the son of polish immigrant parents has headed the 
nations fifthlargest archdiocese since 1981 he was among 25 
church leaders promoted sunday by pope john paul ii they will be 
formally elevated during ceremonies june 28 at the vatican 
the archbishop said during a news conference at his home on 
sunday that he learned of his promotion may 21 by telephone from 
archbishop pio laghi the popes representative in the united 
states he later received a formal letter signed by the pope whose 
us tour last fall ended in detroit 
i am deeply moved and honored by the holy fathers decision 
szoka said in a prepared statement i am most grateful to his 
holiness for the trust and confidence reflected by his decision to 
elevate me to the college of cardinals 
at the same time i recognize that this honor goes far beyond 
any personal accomplishments on my part he added it is 
clearly rooted in the position i hold as the archbishop of detroit 
the honor given to me as a cardinal of the church is meant to 
honor this entire metropolis 
szoka said his new duties would not affect his administration of 
the detroit archdiocese which has 149 million members and nearly 
1000 priests in 331 parishes in six counties of southeast michigan 
itll be the same ministry ill carry on the same functions 
whether im cardinal or not he said the fact that i may have 
greater visibility may help the church all of you reporters 
being here today gives the church a little more exposure and that 
helps 
szoka becomes the third consecutive head of the detroit 
archdiocese to be made a cardinal the rev edward mooney 
archbishop from 193958 and the rev john dearden archbishop from

discontent with a new nationwide trucking 
contract and teamster president jackie pressers worsening health 
are cutting a deep fissure in the hierarchy of the countrys 
largest union 
the official reaction to questions about presser about the 
jockeying for position on who might succeed him and about the new 
national master freight agreement is that the union is functioning 
smoothly under secretarytreasurer weldon mathis 
everybody hopes and is operating on the expectation jackie 
will be back duke zeller the unions chief spokesman said last 
week we all know his recuperative powers for a power struggle 
to be going on its awfully quiet around here 
however insiders acknowledge that many of the 16 teamster vice 
presidents on the 16 millionmember unions executive board 
disagree sharply over mathis stewardship while presser has been 
undergoing operations and extensive chemotherapy and radiation 
treatments for cancer during the past 18 months 
the divisiveness has flared in recent weeks with the teamsters 
acceptance of a new trucking contract covering about 200000 of its 
members despite a nearly 2to1 rankandfile vote against it 
only half of the vice presidents showed up two weeks ago at a 
resort near scottsdale ariz and some of those absent openly 
opposed the new threeyear labor pact with the trucking industry 
the leader of the boycott was 70yearold joseph trerotola of 
new york the ranking and possibly most influential member on the 
teamsters board who directs the unions affairs in its biggest 
stronghold new york and new jersey 
an irony is that many of the board members who prevailed upon 
mathis to convene the meeting are the same ones who boycotted it 
whats amazing is that this infighting has all sloshed out 
into the open says ken paff an organizer for a dissident 
faction teamsters for a democratic union in the past its all 
been kept in the family 
paffs organization which has close ties to consumer activist 
ralph nader filed suit on behalf of five union members in us 
district court in washington last week seeking to overturn the 
trucking contract on charges of ballot fraud in the ratification 
vote 
mathis called the claims ridiculous and accused the 
plaintiffs in the suit of trying to destroy the accord and the 
standards that the teamsters have fought long and hard for our 
members to preserve 
until the unions constitution was changed two years ago 
trerotola rather than mathis a friendly 62yearold unionist who 
started his career as a business agent in an atlanta local 
automatically would have received the nod as interim head of the 
union in pressers absence 
some teamster insiders insisted last week that the 
littlenoticed constitutional change at the unions 1986 convention 
had nothing to do with the personalities of the two men or other 
top union officials 
instead they described it has a housecleaning measure agreed 
upon after presser underwent a heart bypass operation in late 1983 
to assure that control of the union remained with officials at its 
international headquarters in washington 
but they and officials in other unions with close ties to the 
teamsters say the change reflects pressers gradual and cautious 
moves in the past five years to shift the balance of power in the 
union from its secretive old guard to a new more 
imageconscious generation of trade unionists 
presser 61 won the top post in the union in 1983 largely on 
his own public relations efforts which included serving on 
president reagans transition team and promoting a higher teamster 
profile on capitol hill and in the press to counter longstanding 
charges of corruption 
three of the past six teamster presidents david beck jimmy 
hoffa and roy williams have been removed from office after being 
sentenced to prison on tax evasion jury tampering or bribery 
convictions 
however the government has largely thwarted pressers campaign 
to improve the teamsters image in late 1985 a white house 
commission alleged that both presser and his predecessor williams 
were handpicked for the unions presidency by organized crime 
figures 
six months later a federal grand jury indicted presser on 
charges of helping embezzle 700000 from a cleveland local which 
he also heads through a ghost employees payroll padding scheme 
and mathis told the aflcios executive council two weeks ago 
that the teamsters have every reason to believe the government 
still intends to file a civil suit seeking to oust all of the 
unions top officials on a claim the teamsters leadership is 
dominated by racketeers 
leaks from government officials about the anticipated suit last 
year prompted a mutual aid pact between the teamsters and the 
aflcio which feared the precedent that a government victory might 
set for other unions 
bitter rivals for 30 years they reestablished formal ties in 
october with the teamsters being welcomed back into the 90union 
federation 
the two teamster officials most responsible for making the 
reaffiliation work have been mathis and walter shea a veteran 
washington insider whose demeanor and image is more that of a state 
department diplomat than a labor leader 
shea a teamsters vice president since 1982 is believed to be 
trerotolas top choice as a challenger to mathis to succeed presser 
other possible challengers include joseph morgan of hallandale 
fla and donald peters of chicago both sought the job when 
williams was sentenced to prison in 1983 and arnie weinmeister of 
seattle director of the unions western conference 
mathis has the inside track but its certainly not a smooth 
one says paff of the teamsters for a democratic union 
others closer to the teamster leadership also expect a serious 
challenge to mathis should presser not return following a 120day 
leave of absence after undergoing surgery to remove a pair of 
cancer tumors from his brain 
asked if mathis critics could unite behind a single challenger 
to deny mathis the teamsters presidency one insider said 
thats the big question

in naming a new batch of cardinals pope 
john paul ii seeks to expand his churchs influence in the soviet 
union and china but us roman catholics may be disappointed in 
their share of the 25 new red hats 
two new american cardinals are on the list of new princes 
from 18 countries announced by the pope on sunday archbishops 
edmund c szoka 60 of detroit and james a hickey 67 of 
washington dc 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said the passing over of los 
angeles archbishop roger mahony 52 was the great exclusion 
among other possible american candidates 
he said mahony was bypassed because of his relative youth and is 
likely to become a cardinal at a later time 
the appointment of szoka and hickey will bring to five the 
number of active us cardinals the others are bernard law of 
boston joseph bernardin of chicago and john oconnor of new york 
the new cardinals will be installed at a june 28 vatican session 
and bring to 161 the membership in the college of cardinals the 
churchs most important governing body cardinals under age 80 
now 120 elect a popes successor 
john paul making the announcement during a mass in st peters 
basilica said his choice of new cardinals underlines the 
universality of the church in fact among the new cardinals 
there are prelates from every continent navarro said the 
polishborn pope was seeking to bolster church influence by naming 
cardinals from lithuania the roman catholic stronghold in the 
soviet union and hong kong the british colony that passes to 
chinese communist rule in 1997 
these are not symbolic choices but they are options for the 
future navarro told reporters 
the lithuanian prelate vincentas sladkevicius 68 was 
impeded by soviet authorities from performing his religious 
duties and held under virtual house arrest from 1963 to 1982 the 
vatican says 
sladkevicius is an historic choice the first publicly named 
cardinal from lithuania which was an independent republic before 
world war ii at least 2 million of lithuanias 35 million people 
are roman catholics 
there has been widespread speculation that another lithuanian is 
the cardinal the pope chose in pectore in his heart in 1979 
sladkevicius will be just the second residient cardinal in the 
soviet union following the elevation of julijans vaivods of latvia 
in 1985 
john paul has publicly disclosed that on at least two occasions 
he has been refused permission to visit lithuania 
but there have been signs of a recent thaw in vaticansoviet 
relations with permission given to a large vatican delegation to 
visit moscow next month for celebrations marking the millenium of 
christianity in russia 
looking toward china the other communist giant the pope named 
as cardinal the 63yearold bishop of hong kong john baptist wu 
chengchung 
there has been no resident cardinal in china since the 
communists took over after world war ii 
the last chinese cardinal was paul yu pin archbishop of 
nanking who was expelled after the communist takeover and named a 
cardinal in 1969 he died in rome in 1978 
the hong kong bishop recently named a committee to map church 
strategy when the british colony reverts to china 
china has given assurances about maintaining the status quo on 
hong kong but church leaders have expressed some uncertainty about 
possible change 
china cut ties with the vatican in 1957 and established its own 
breakaway catholic church which now claims 3 million members an 
unknown number of other catholics remain secretly loyal to the 
pope and several are still being held in prison for their 
religious practices 
the pope also named the first cardinal in mozambique a marxist 
country the pope will visit when he makes his fourth tour of africa 
in september 
the new cardinals also include four italians two each from 
brazil spain and india and one each from canada colombia 
australia hungary cameroon austria france west germany 
mauritius and switzerland 
in addition to voting to elect a pope cardinals act as advisers 
to the pope serve on special vatican commissions and often act as 
de facto spokesmen for the church in their countries

gov ray mabus elected on a pledge that 
mississippi never again would be last came away from his first 
legislative session with less than half of his reform package 
approved but his optimism undiminished 
for novembers election the 39yearold harvardeducated lawyer 
and former state auditor built a coalition of blacks urban 
professionals and those pushing for change to fend off the 
strongest challenge by a republican gubernatorial candidate this 
century 
he pledged to end the longstanding reign of good ol boy 
politics public corruption a poor education system and widespread 
illiteracy high unemployment and lowpaying jobs 
to that end mabus took a fourpoint program to lawmakers in 
january calling for government reorganization increased spending 
for education including a hefty pay raise for teachers county 
government reorganization and constitutional reform 
in the session ended may 7 the legislature approved a 
scaledback plan to raise teacher salaries to the current southeast 
average by phasing in an average raise of 3800 during two years 
costing 180 million 
mabus also got agreement on a 25member commission to look at 
reorganization the governor wants to reduce what he regards as a 
bloated bureaucracy by slashing the number of state agencies from 
more than 160 to as few as 15 potentially one of the most 
farreaching things we can do he said 
but he got nothing from lawmakers on amending or rewriting the 
states 98yearold constitution or county government reform 
i think we were successful mabus said in a recent 
interview i think if you get everything you asked for you 
probably didnt ask for enough 
above all mabus believes mississippi which ranks last or near 
the bottom among states in such categories as per capita income and 
first in school dropouts is headed in the right direction 
we got mississippi moving down the road to what were going to 
have to do he said if we dont get down to some of these 
structural things like the budget like reorganization like 
county unit were going to doom mississippi to the bottom tier 
economically for a long time to come and i dont think anybody 
wants that 
as part of his agenda mabus wants to require all counties to 
adopt countywide purchasing receiving personnel management and 
road construction and maintenance policies in 60 of the states 82 
counties each of five county supervisors directly oversees 
operations in the district from which he or she is elected 
as state auditor for the four years before he was elected 
governor mabus assisted the fbi in its operation pretense 
investigation into corrupt county purchasing it resulted in the 
arrests of 52 supervisors in 24 counties of which 43 were 
convicted or pleaded guilty and 23 received prison sentences 
the house and senate passed differing versions of a socalled 
county unit bill but negotiators never reached a compromise 
mabus subsequently vetoed a 20 percent pay hike for supervisors 
and has promised to call a special session for lawmakers to deal 
with county unit legislation 
im confident were going to get county unit passed through 
both houses of the legislature mabus said once people go home 
and listen to their constituents it will happen 
mabus also remained determined on constitutional reform and 
said that even though a reform measure died at the end of the 
session we got farther than anyone else ever has 
last november voters approved 10 constitutional amendments 
including one that removes nearly a centuryold ban on interracial 
marriage critics say some provisions of the 1890 constitution 
remain racist it includes a poll tax and literacy requirement for 
voting although they have been struck down by federal courts 
other provisions discourage economic development and efficient 
government critics say 
the governor wanted the legislature to allow voters in november 
to approve a constitutional convention that would rewrite the 
constitution 
despite the measures failure he insisted the issue wont go 
away 
at some point the people of mississippi are going to vote on 
it he said

while president reagan and soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev meet this week dozens of young musicians in the 
united states and the soviet union are tuning up for a musical 
summit this summer 
the 110member americansoviet youth orchestra makes its debut 
in august the start of a monthlong concert swing through five 
us cities and three in the soviet union 
its such a great opportunity to make music and travel in the 
united states and travel in russia says caroline coade 20 of 
san diego 
ms coade who plays the viola and graduates monday from oberlin 
college is one of 58 americans and 52 soviets ages 17 to 23 
selected for the orchestra twelve participants are from oberlin 
college 
the orchestra will assemble at oberlins campus july 16 for 
rehearsals and workshops to acquaint them with each others social 
and cultural traditions 
after that the orchestra will have its premiere aug 5 at the 
kennedy center for the performing arts in washington under the 
baton of zubin mehta music director of the new york philharmonic 
the orchestras repertoire includes works by american and 
russian composers the new york performance also will feature the 
world premiere of a piece by soviet composer edison denisov 
the inspiration behind the orchestra came from a luncheon 
attended by oberlin president s frederick starr an expert on 
soviet affairs and officials of afs intercultural programs an 
international exchange group based in new york said grace kennan 
warnecke the orchestras executive director 
she raised the idea with the soviet ministry of culture last 
year and found it was greeted with far more enthusiasm on both 
sides than anticipated which is not to say it still isnt 
hard 
ms warnecke said a joint orchestra wouldnt have been possible 
before glasnost gorbachevs policy of openness although separate 
tours have been permitted 
whats different about this is were creating a brand new 
institution from scratch said ms warneke who lived in the 
soviet union periodically as a child and attended fifthgrade in a 
soviet school while her father george f kennan was us 
ambassador 
she said the orchestra could be ongoing but efforts are 
concentrated on this years program 
if glasnost becomes a complete success increasing openness to 
the point that we dont need a sovietamerican orchestra 
well put ourselves out of business and thats all the better 
she said 
the american musicians from 24 states were chosen from 500 who 
auditioned either in person or with tapes their expenses will be 
paid and theyll receive a small allowance negotiations are 
continuing but most of the money to cover costs in the united 
states is coming from foundations ms warneke said 
in the soviet union the orchestra will be sponsored by the 
ministry of culture and gosconsert 
the trip to the soviet union will be especially important for 
claudia lasareffmironoff 23 who is studying for a masters 
degree in viola at northwestern university her parents left the 
soviet union as children and emmigrated to the united states after 
world war ii 
i think its really important that we share musical ideas 
said ms lasareffmironoff who speaks russian 
calvin lewis who studies the violin at the cleveland institute 
of music doesnt know any russian 
music is a language in itself i dont think therell be a 
problem said lewis 18 of hephzibah ga 
during the orchestras 2 weeks here the musicians will 
rehearse with larry rachleff oberlin conductor and music director 
and leonid nikolaev for the moscow conservatory of music 
after the opening concert the musicians will perform in new 
york city on aug 7 milwaukee aug 9 san francisco aug 11 and 
trenton nj aug 14 the soviet tour will open and close with 
concerts in moscow with four concerts in two other cities in

its a dogs work chasing hogs but 
angie the hog dog never fails to get the bite on the porkers on 
elmer cranes farm 
angie a 40pound australian cattle dog contends with sows 
weighing up to 600 pounds as she gets hogs moving for cranes 
daughter ruby west 
their natural instinct is to work stock says ms west who 
got angie from an indiana breeder four years ago and they do 
that by biting at them 
angie minds me if i whistle or if i call sooey she knows 
that im moving pigs and she comes running from wherever she is 
angie stands motionless near the hog lot her eyes fixed in a 
menacing gunfighter squint she waits for a signal from ms 
west to spring into action 
she can tell by what i have in my hand what shes going to 
have to do ms west says if i walk into the lot with a 
syringe to inject medicine she wont move she knows i dont 
want the pigs moving around then 
but if ive got a stick or prod in my hand shes ready to 
move pigs 
angie thinks fast on her feet to stay out of harms way ms 
west says 
sows can get pretty rough she says that nipping will 
make them pretty mad once in awhile and they try to bite her sows 
can move fast but angies faster she can jump or climb out of the 
way when they come after her 
angie doesnt always get the last bite however 
during a temporary lull in the activity on the hog lot recently 
angie settled in for a nap against a shed wall a curious porker 
approached her from behind bent its head toward the sleeping dog 
and administered a healthy root 
angie sprang to her feet in a moment of confusion 
the hog obviously satisfied with its minor victory made a 
speedy and wise retreat around the corner of the shed

theft or violent crime struck one out of every 
four american homes in 1987 with black and hispanic homes being 
hit at higher than the average rate the justice department says 
the bureau of justice statistics said sunday the national crime 
rate against homes was 24 percent about the same rate recorded in 
the previous two years 
the bureau said 239 percent of white homes 278 percent of 
black homes and 301 percent of hispanic homes were hit last year 
by some sort of crime 
homes in the northeast were the least affected 19 percent 
while those in the west were the most vulnerable at 29 percent 
the rates were 25 percent in the midwest and 24 percent in the 
south 
since the bureau began collecting crime data on a household 
basis in 1975 when crime struck one in three homes the rates have 
never shown a yeartoyear increase and dropped substantially over 
the longer term 
bureau director steven r schlesinger noted that there was 
greater improvement among white households than among black ones 
from 1975 to 1987 the rate dropped 25 percent for white homes 
whereas the decline for black homes was 15 percent 
the difference was due primarily to the fact that thefts from 
black homes failed to decline while the reduction in other types 
of crimes was about the same for both white homes and black homes 
the household rates are derived from the national crime survey 
which has interviewed about 99000 people of age 12 or older from a 
sample of 49000 homes around the nation

venereal disease once virtually eliminated in 
china is once again a problem and has in one year increased 
threefold in a province relatively open to foreigners a ministry 
of public health official said today 
cao qing deputy director of the ministrys department of 
epidemic prevention told a news conference that cases of sexually 
transmitted disease have increased in recent years as china 
implements its opendoor policy 
in 1987 authorities in guandong province which borders hong 
kong and is one of chinas most open areas recorded 5600 cases of 
venereal disease three times more than the previous year he said 
cao said he believes the actual figure to be much higher because 
those who contract the disease do not voluntarily come forward 
he said the ministry does not have national figures 
the chinese media have reported frequently that cases of 
sexually transmitted diseases are on the rise but this was the 
first time statistics were given 
after the communist takeover in 1949 campaigns were waged 
against many socalled capitalist vices including prostitution 
chinese authorities for years claimed that venereal disease had 
been virtually wiped out

an 81yearold woman says she and her 
sister lived alone quietly and happily until they were yanked out 
of our home like animals by a county commission decision 
glenna ashby a retired hairdresser cannot comprehend how she 
and her sister were removed from their huntington home last march 
without the benefit of a court hearing or a lawyer to protect them 
ashby said she was unaware her competency even was under 
question until the day the sheriffs department took her away 
i dont understand it all they took hold of my arm and said 
come with me 
we were yanked out of our home like animals ashby said in a 
telephone interview sunday from the morris memorial convalescent 
and nursing home in milton im 100 percent and i am capable and 
i dont need anybody to care for me 
now ive been just about out of my mind i feel so helpless 
im just so worried i felt like a prisoner 
in march the threemember cabell county commission ruled that 
ashby and her 82yearold sister jo ann gillette were mentally 
incompetent and ordered them removed from their home in huntingdon 
80 miles west of here the women were put in the custody of the 
sheriff who put them in the nursing home 
the women say they do not know who instigated the proceedings 
sheriff robert bailey jr said the 20th street bank sought the 
incompetency ruling saying the sisters were unable to manage their 
business affairs and could not care for themselves 
bank officials could not be reached for comment on sunday 
ashby said her sister closed her account with that bank several 
years ago and transferred the money to another huntington bank 
county officials said david pancake a private lawyer appointed 
to investigate the sisters mental health recommended that they be 
put away pancake did not return calls by the associated press to 
his huntington house sunday 
the sisters said they didnt know he was their attorney 
i didnt know anything like that could happen in the united 
states ashby said 
under state law the county commission rules on mental 
competence cases and will receive 5 percent of the sisters estate 
of course they want to go back home everybody wants to go 
back home said gladys jordan appointed by the county to oversee 
the womens affairs as their guardians 
jordan said the sisters were living in horrible conditions 
it was filthy and inhumane conditions at the least jordan 
said i dont think they had had a bath for years and years it 
looked like they had been living in their beds there wasnt even a 
chair their hair was matted together like a dogs hanging in 
their faces 
thats damn lies said ashby 
jordan said the women ate only once a day monday through friday 
and that the house was ratinfested and had a natural gas leak she 
said workers removed 280 bags of newspapers and debris from one 
room alone and found 33700 in cash in the house 
assistant nursing home administrator rose greene corroborated 
jordans account of ashbys and gillettes condition when they were 
brought in the smell it was deplorable she said 
however she said she is unqualified to say if the women belong 
in a full care nursing home or maybe just need someone to check 
on them once a day to make sure they wash themselves 
dr samuel henson a 20year employee of the nursing home where 
ashby and gillette are being kept said friday the women dont 
belong there 
in my opinion they belong at home he said this simply 
goes against everything we attempt to practice in this country 
county commissioner forest underwood defends his decision 
declaring the women incompetent but said he is willing to 
reconsider 
underwood said theres no certain criteria for judging 
incompetence 
its a matter of sitting there gauging and judging what you 
think theyre capable of handling he said 
a 1987 series by the associated press examined guardianship laws 
in each of the 50 states and the district of columbia and found a 
network of overburdened courts that routinely fail to monitor wards 
under their jurisdiction the system often opened the door to 
physical and financial mistreatment according to the series 
guardians of the elderly an ailing system

democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis 
says soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev is holding another summit 
with president reagan because the soviet union is having economic 
problems and he recognizes communism is a failure 
i think that is the driving force behind this the recognition 
on his part that theyre falling further and further behind the 
frontrunner for the democratic nomination said in an interview 
broadcast sunday by the bbc 
gorbachev he said is probably the first kremlin leader to 
recognize that communism is a failure at least the way its been 
practiced in the soviet union 
dukakis said most thoughtful observers agree that it is the 
very serious condition of the soviet domestic situation that has 
been largely responsible for gorbachevs involvement in the 
summit 
unless the soviet union begins to devote significantly more 
resources to its domestic economy and less to the military 
than theyre going to become a thirdrate economic power he said

the owners of a swimsuit shop traded in 
their measuring tape for a hightech computer system to make 
perfectfitting suits for imperfect physiques now the retailers 
say they have their profits sewn up 
kathleen oconnor and michael pellegrini of suit systems say 
they expect to sell 3000 suits and gross 250000 in their first 
year in the custommade swimsuit business 
the venture began last year when the two went to singer island 
fla and visited a shop called second skin whose owner uses a 
computer to measure its cutomers 
after oconnor bought a suit she and pellegrini decided to open 
a similar business in this tourist haven visited by thousands each 
year 
they spent about 26000 for training and a license required to 
operate the patented computer system 
when they first opened they expected business to be slow it 
was after all december but instead of selling one or two suits a 
week they sold about 25 
now suit systems sells 50 to 60 swim suits a week to their 
women customers the suits range from 58 to 130 
the most common customers are those with the most common 
figure problems said oconnor 
ive had a handful of customers with figure deformities she 
said including one woman with a surgical diagonal scar across her 
back and under the bust area a suit with extrawide straps covered 
up the problem she said 
on a busy day the shop is filled with women trying on the plain 
black suits that are used for taking measurements standing against 
a back wall and being filmed by the computer 
once the filming is finished oconnor rewinds the tape and 
stops at various parts of the womans body to take measurements 
the process takes 10 minutes 
it then takes the shops seamstresses about 20 minutes to make a 
tank suit an hour for more complex designs 
choosing a fabric may take the most time the walls of the shop 
and downstairs sewing room are lined with more than 300 fabrics 
made of lycranylon and lycracotton blends 
the newport store is the sixth to be licensed by michele deziel 
owner of second skin she discovered a patented computer program 
for measuring in california about 3 years ago 
i purchased it and had a store open in 30 days deziel said 
deziel said she grossed about 230000 last year in the retail 
portion of her business she declined to say what she earned from 
computer training and licensing 
the training sessions usually take 10 days in florida and 
another 10 at the proposed shop site once store owners pay the 
26000 fee for training and the license they are no longer 
financially obligated to deziel 
deziel also promises not to sell a license for the computer 
system to anyone else in the new stores territory for a year or 
more 
besides newport and singer island there are similar shops in 
long island ny philadelphia detroit ocean city md and 
myrtle beach sc

thousands of antigovernment students 
marched through the city today yelling yankee go home and 
burned a huge american flag before police broke up the 
demonstration with tear gas 
once the giant us flag was set ablaze police fired tear gas 
from armored vans and hundreds of riot troops in green combat 
fatigues and visored helmets charged protesters in front of seouls 
central railway station 
about 10000 protesters had gathered outside the station after 
marching with the coffin of a student who set himself on fire in an 
earlier antigovernment protest police did not intervene during 
the peaceful fourmile march 
south korea has during the past two weeks been hit by a wave of 
violent antigovernment and antius protests by radical students 
who are calling for the overthrow of president roh taewoo and 
removal of the 42000 us troops on their soil 
roh a former general who took office in february after winning 
an election two months earlier ordered a crackdown friday to halt 
protests he said the radicals were threatening the olympic games 
to be held in seoul in september 
in a speech today to the opening session of the national 
assembly roh appealed to opposition parties to work with him to 
ensure full democracy and stability 
he called for an end to political violence and peace on college 
campuses 
in april 26 elections the governing party lost its majority in 
the national assembly for the first time ever 
todays march like other recent protests in which us 
diplomatic offices were attacked was vehemently antiamerican 
radicals claim the united states enforces military rule in south 
korea and enforces partition of the korean peninsula 
drive out the yankees who block unification of our 
fatherland said one speaker 
marchers yelled antiamerican slogans as they walked past a us 
army housing compound where a line of armed us military police 
stood guard but there were no incidents 
the radical protesters screamed drive out the yankee 
imperialists and cheered as the american flag burned they tossed 
firebombs at it to further fuel the blaze 
a handful of students also hurled firebombs at attacking police 
but most protesters and hundreds of commuters and onlookers ran for 
cover as authorities chased them 
police seized some protesters and dragged them away but police 
officials declined to give arrest figures officers tossed teargas 
grenades at bystanders who complained about the police attack 
there were no immediate reports of injury 
lines of riot police with interlocked shields swept the square 
in front of the train station clean other officers hunted in the 
station for hiding students and smashed scores of unused firebombs 
abandoned by protesters 
choi duksoo for whom the funeral march was held died thursday 
he had set himself on fire may 18 to protest the holding of a 
student spring festival on the anniversary of a 1980 
antigovernment uprising in the southern city of kwangju 
the coffin escorted by hundreds of students in buses left the 
station to travel to kwangju for burial just before police attacked 
during the earlier funeral march through the city protesters 
carried hundreds of placards bearing portraits of choi musicians 
in white mourning clothes beat drums and singers performed haunting 
funeral songs 
the coffin was carried at the head of the column behind a giant 
south korean flag a large portrait of choi surrounded by orange 
flames followed on a truck draped in black 
down with military dictatorship and fight to the end 
read slogans on a sea of 30foothigh green black and white silk 
banners carried by marchers 
chois was the second political suicide by a radical student in 
a month cho sungman stabbed himself and jumped off a building may 
15 
ritual suicide is a traditional form of protest to shame the 
government 
todays speakers blamed roh and the united states for the bloody 
suppression of the kwangju uprising in which at least 191 people 
were killed 
the recent demonstrations have failed to draw much public 
support and they have been confined mainly to radical college 
students a small but powerful minority major riots last summer 
had strong support and prompted the government to accept elections

this nation with one of the worlds 
lowest per capita incomes is expanding ties with the noncommunist 
world and china eager for economic development and perhaps less 
dependence on neighboring vietnam 
if you are isolated you cannot grow economic planner 
somphavanh ithavong said of laos a sparsely populated landlocked 
nation of 39 million people 
several western nations and international agencies have 
responded to vientianes periodic requests for emergency food aid 
as well as longterm assistance in developing roads communications 
and other infrastructure 
when donors and politicians view indochina as a whole laos 
looks relatively attractive says one vientianebased western 
diplomat it certainly isnt the pariah vietnam and cambodia have 
become 
the nations per capita income is about 150 a year 
in the political sphere laos recently appointed an ambasssador 
to china and says a border trade treaty will be concluded by years 
end relations with beijing had been downgraded when vietnamled 
indochina squared off against its onetime communist ally to the 
north in the late 1970s 
half or more of the 4000050000 vietnamese troops stationed in 
laos were quietly withdrawn beginning in mid1987 according to 
laotian officials and diplomats here 
this reduction is not only bound to improve relations with 
china but it may alter one persistent perception of laos as a 
satellite of hanoi 
vietnam along with the soviet union is officially lauded as a 
fraternal ally and there is little indication laos could suddenly 
veer off on a political course independent from hanois 
but some laotian officials privately talk about useless 
vietnamese aid projects a knowitall arrogance of vietnamese 
experts and they take pride in an economic performance 
superior to that of their supposed mentors 
we tell our vietnamese brothers that they should go home to 
take care of their many problems said one vientiane ministry 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the soviet bloc including vietnam has provided the bulk of aid 
to laos but noncommunist nations now account for more than half 
the 100 million to 150 million that laos receives annually in 
economic assistance the bulk of students sent abroad in the past 
have headed for the soviet bloc but some will now be studying in 
australia japan france and possibly the united states 
a recently passed foreign investment code appears designed to 
attract capitaliststyle enterprises it includes liberal 
provisions on repatriation of profits and foreign equity in 
businesses 
a large influx of private foreign capital is not generally 
expected but even the united states with only an annual 1 
million twoway trade and shaky political relations has voiced 
some optimism 
the us embassys most recent survey notes that ongoing 
economic reforms do seem to present an opportunity to us 
business which did not exist in the past 
the biggest noncommunist aid donors are japan sweden and 
australia and the world bank and asian development bank are key 
agency backers some aid officials believe laos which has a small 
managerial pool is straining its capacity to absorb outside 
assistance 
thailand exerts the greatest effect on the daytoday economy as 
consumer goods pour across the mekong river frontier across three 
official trading points and dozens of smuggling routes 
even while thailand and laos fought a bloody battle over 
disputed territory early this year unofficial trade was barely 
affected those within reach of thai television kept up with their 
favorite soap operas 
although the potential for close ties is probably there 
suspicion of thai motives and those of some other western nations 
remain 
most diplomats and other foreigners must seek permission to 
travel beyond about four miles of the capital nonofficial contact 
between laotians and foreigners is discouraged 
vientiane has accused thailand and the united states of aiding 
anticommunist insurgents along the thailaotian border and bitter 
memories of the war between usbacked and communist forces linger 
laos also resents private american forays in search of the 555 
us servicemen still missing in action from the vietnam war 
vientiane recently permitted the third official uslaotian 
excavation of an mia crash site but vice foreign minister soubanh 
srithirath bluntly told western newsmen here recently there would 
be no further searches until washington came up with some 
humanitarian aid for his country

president reagan and kremlin leader mikhail s 
gorbachev probably will sign at wednesdays summit session two arms 
control agreements that had appeared to be shelved only last week 
a senior us official said today 
one provides for prenotification of missile test launches the 
other sets the ground rules for joint experiments to monitor 
underground nuclear tests 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
soviets had initially demanded a broader prenotification 
arrangement but accepted the initial us proposal when their 
demand was turned down 
the agreement on monitoring tests also appeared to be 
sidetracked until senior us and soviet arms control specialists 
met sunday night 
on saturday reagan administration officials said they did not 
expect to have those agreements ready for the signatures of the 
leaders during the summit 
things have changed the official said 
under the prenotification agreement which was negotiated as 
part of the proposed strategic arms reduction treaty each side 
would notify the other in advance of the time place and intended 
target of ballistic missile test launches 
we had proposed just lifting that section out of start the 
official said but the soviets objected and wanted to include what 
they called other confidencebuilding measures including 
notification of tests involving airlaunched cruise missiles and 
other weapons 
the other likely agreement is a protocol for a joint 
verification experiment to test a new means of monitoring 
compliannce with the threshhold test ban treaty which was signed 
on oct 7 1974 but never ratified by the senate 
the administration has accused the soviets of likely 
exceeding the treatys ceiling of 150 kiloton for nuclear test 
explosions a charge the soviets deny and the administration has 
insisted that the soviets allow use of a new technology known as 
corrtex to supplement existing seismic measuring devices 
signing of the protocol would clear the way for tests scheduled 
this summer at us and soviet sites and would virtually guarantee 
completion of a related pact the peaceful nuclear explosions 
treaty signed on may 28 1976 barring the two sides from peaceful 
explosions of more than 150 kilotons 
reagan and gorbachev were meeting to assess whether facetoface 
diplomacy can remove some of the stumbling blocks that have kept 
the superpowers from agreeing on the start treaty to sharply reduce 
their arsenals of nuclear weapons 
a major breakthrough was unlikely but a joint team of senior 
us and soviet negotiators went to work sunday night to discuss 
verification issues among the most difficult in the search for an 
accord 
when reagan and gorbachev started their series of summit 
meetings of which moscow is the fourth the hope developed that 
they might agree on sharp cuts from 30 to as much as 50 percent 
in the superpowers stockpiles of their biggest weapons 
so far chiefly because of verification and the issue of star 
wars testing an agreement has been elusive 
gorbachev made it clear in his statement greeting reagan on 
sunday that he was determined to preserve the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty which restrains testing for the star 
wars missile defense program 
still gennady gerasimov the soviet foreign ministry spokesman 
said his government was willing to join in a mutual pledge to 
adhere to the treaty for a specified period 
gorbachev said however another summit with reagan was quite 
possible if the treaty could be completed during the less than 
eight months remaining in the reagan administration 
not having that accord in hand reagan and gorbachev on 
wednesday will have a ceremonial exchange of a more limited treaty 
to abolish their landbased missiles in the range of 300 to 3400 
miles 
the treaty was signed at the summit meeting in washington last 
december but the senate held up ratification until several 
verification procedures were clarified 
roman popadiuk a white house spokesman said that us and 
soviet working groups convened sunday night after the meeting 
between secretary of state george p shultz and soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze which lasted from 730 pm to 
930 pm 
paul nitze was the chairman of the us team negotiating arms 
control issues and assistant secretary of state rozanne ridgway 
was heading the american teams discussing human rights regional 
and bilateral issues 
the soviet arms control team is headed by marshal sergei 
akhromeyev the soviet chief of staff and deputy minister of 
defense said gerasimov aleksandr bessmertnykh the deputy foreign 
minister was heading the soviet team discussing other issues he 
said

cocaine led to the drowning death of a 
10yearold boy an autopsy found but his grandmother wont 
believe it 
ill go to my grave and theyll never convince me that my 
grandson used drugs said geraldine baker who raised andrew 
baker for the first nine years of his life 
but the will county coroners office said it found evidence of 
cocaine in his bloodsteam the chicago tribune reported sunday 
you wouldnt even expect this in chicago why it happened 
here how it happened here we dont know said charles connor 
mayor of this town of 77000 people 30 miles southwest of chicago 
the county coroners office determined the 4thgrader drowned in 
a ymca swimming pool april 16 because cocaine in his blood caused 
him to lose consciousness 
the pathologist who performed an autopsy found a cluster of 
fungus in the boys heart evidence the boy had been injected 
previously with a dirty hypodermic needle or impure drugs said 
chief deputy coroner william ferguson 
the fungus combined with the cocaine in andrews blood caused 
an inflammation of the heart the autopsy showed the heart beat 
irregularly while he was swimming and the boy lost consciousness 
and drowned 
the findings suggest that the deceased used cocaine on more 
than one occasion including shortly before death and that both 
respiratory and intravenous routes of administration were used 
the report states 
sheriffs deputies said they have few clues about who supplied 
the cocaine that killed andrew 
andrew moved in with his mother jolene williams about a year 
ago she said she also does not believe the lab results 
where did he get it how did he afford it said ms 
williams 30 
ferguson said he initially had trouble believing the autopsy 
report 
i sympathize with the family in thinking that we somehow made 
a mistake ferguson said but the lab has run the sample many 
times at my request they feel confident that their results were 
accurate

in a battle of lightningfast minds a team from 
north carolina state prevailed as students from 16 universities 
tested their memories in the national college bowl championship 
one might think of college bowl players as eggheads but 
eggheads are the worst college bowl players said don reid who 
created the game 35 years ago 
the best players in a college bowl game will eventually be the 
players in the game of life said reid who attended the weekend 
event 
dan petrus a 24yearold veterinary student at nc state 
helped his team capture the victory by answering this question 
in a february 1988 poll of its readers by rolling stone he was 
voted worst male singer and worst dressed and creator of the worst 
album and worst single in other words really and truly bad 
the answer michael jackson 
one of the questions in the final match between nc state and 
emory university was on mondays tuesdays and thursdays he 
works from 9 to 5 on wednesdays from 9 to 1 and on fridays until 
early afternoon during working hours he often takes two or three 
hours to read and answer his fan mail 
emorys mike barkin a 25yearold law school graduate pushed 
his buzzer and yelled president reagan before the moderator 
finished reading the question 
that was right according to journalist bob woodwards recent 
book about former cia chief william casey but it wasnt good 
enough to win the national college bowl title 
other questions during the twoday event held at the chicago 
campus of the university of illinois dealt with subjects ranging 
from chemistry to the wizard of oz 
petrus a rugby player said hes good at the game because i 
remember a lot of facts and im able to recall them quickly 
but petrus said it takes practice to perform well in the college 
bowl so his team trains four hours a week 
the college bowl started on national radio in 1953 and then 
became a regular television show in 1959 the game is still shown 
periodically on us television and is broadcast in 12 foreign 
countries reid said 
reid a former basketball star said he thought up the game 
because he felt there has to be some way to have fun with a 
sport of the mind 
the championships began saturday with fourman teams from 16 
colleges answering a moderators questions with various point 
values in a series of rounds each team was paired with another and 
had to accumulate more points than the other to win the round and 
eliminate the loser from the competition 
no prizes were awarded to participants but petrus said the 
reward of beating teams from colleges such as princeton university 
the university of chicago massachusetts institute of technology 
and cornell university is knowing that youve been able to think 
faster and outthink the others its an ego thing

cornell universitys president warned 
graduating students that the commencement ceremony has its dangers 
if i had one thing to do id put a label on your diplomas 
that would read the president has determined that graduation may 
be dangerous for your health frank ht rhodes told the 4000 
degree recipients on sunday 
because graduation has been the grand objective for the last 
four years it has been your lodestar so what replaces all of 
this now i mean not just a first job but what lodestar what new 
overarching goal 
the second reason graduation is a danger has to do with the 
academic style said rhodes who because of cornell tradition was 
the only speaker at the commencement ceremony 
its results are abstraction detachment moral abstention 
it can substitute criticism for creativity analysis for 
affirmation removing all the mystery all the subtle intangible 
qualities that give deeper meaning to our existence he said 
but there is an antidote to the dangers of graduation rhodes 
said quoting albert schweitzer 
i dont know what your destiny will be but one thing i know 
the only ones among you who will be really happy are those who have 
sought and found how to serve he said

president najib opened a multiparty 
national parliament with a call to rebels to abandon their 
eightyear war and join the government 
also sunday a guerrilla leader claimed antigovernment forces 
control 90 percent of the afghan countryside 
during talks in peshawar pakistan rebel alliance spokesman 
gulbadin hekmatyar urged the un official overseeing afghan 
refugees to work with reconstruction and resettlement commissions 
already set up by the guerrillas 
in kabul meanwhile najib said he would not concede any 
territory to the guerrillas who have been fighting his 
sovietbacked government for a decade 
in a 20minute speech interrupted seven times by applause from 
members of parliament najib continued his efforts to portray 
himself as no longer the leader of a oneparty state 
the parliament the first in 15 years was elected april 14 as 
part of a government effort to widen its base it consists of the 
house of representatives and a 158member senate and replaces the 
revolutionary council as afghanistans lawmaking body 
the guerrilla groups called the elections a farce 
foreign observers say virtually all the seats in the house not 
occupied by members of najibs peoples democratic party of 
afghanistan are held by groups or individuals with ties to the 
government 
two former guerrillas hold what the government calls 
opposition seats 
there are 50 vacant seats that najib says have been left open 
for the guerrillas if they stop fighting 
we are ready to listen to the views of the opposition najib 
said we are ready to receive them in kabul 
the session was held as rebel forces have been mounting attacks 
in and around kabul 
najib said the signing of an accord last month providing for the 
withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan opened new doors for 
peace in afghanistan but he said it does not mean overnight 
peace 
the usbacked guerrillas have not halted their battle despite 
the start of the soviet withdrawal may 15 and they say theyll 
keep fighting as long as najib a former secret police commander 
remains in power 
rocket attacks by the guerrillas have grown more frequent since 
soviet troops started withdrawing the kabul times reported that 
five people were killed in rocket attacks friday 
in the frontier city of peshawar un refugee commissioner 
sadaruddin agha khan held talks with rebel leaders and refugees 
he is charged with overseeing repatriation of refugees who 
number about 3 million in pakistan and 2 million in iran 
hekmatyar said guerrilla forces now hold 90 percent of the 
afghan countryside and told agha khan that he expects few afghan 
refugees to return this year 
however he said most will resettle within a few months after 
all soviet troops pull out final withdrawal is scheduled for feb 
15 1989 
during his meeting with the sevenparty rebel afghan alliance 
agha khan said i made it clear to the people in kabul we have to 
have access to all regions everywhere in all provinces of 
afghanistan 
the afghan government was told that help would never be 
channeled through one particular source and be used as a weapon 
he said 
hekmatyar said millions of mines littering afghanistan have to 
be defused before refugees can return 
it is the duty of the un and its coordinator to ask and 
persuade the russians to demine all of afghanistan and take back 
all that they have planted he said

two dozen volunteers trying to save a 
beached 28foot gray whale shielded it from the sun and poured 
water on it to prevent dehydration but the whale died after a few 
hours 
the whale was discovered thrashing in the surf on an ocean beach 
friday afternoon by naomi leonardo a youngster from kirkland who 
notified police 
when lyle moss a nearby resident saw it was still on the beach 
saturday morning he called grays harbor county sheriffs deputies 
other residents and high school students also responded 
volunteers erected a shelter to keep the sun off the whale 
while others poured water over it 
those kids that came out they really did a job moss said 
volunteers considered trying to free the whale at high tide 
saturday morning but the water wasnt high enough moss said the 
whale died saturday night 
gray whales can survive only a few hours ashore on their side 
because internal organs become damaged said larry waldron a 
hoquiam resident who has worked to rehabilitate wildlife the 
volunteers knew the whale probably wouldnt survive but wanted to 
ease its suffering he said 
the whale had fresh bite wounds that could have come from killer 
whales off the coast killer whales that prey on seals in the area 
probably drove the gray whale ashore he said

a palestinian general strike only partially 
paralyzed the occupied lands today it was the first time such a 
protest faltered since the uprising against israeli occupation 
began in december 
the underground united national leadership had called for the 
strike to keep attention focused on the protest during a 
ussoviet summit however most of the gaza strip remained open 
and transport was running in some parts of the west bank 
israeli leaders and some palestinians have said support for 
strikes and protests is waning 
however in the gaza strips jabaliya refugee camp today a 
protest broke out after a 28yearold palestinian woman was shot 
and her 9monthold daughter lost an eye from a rubber bullet 
during a clash with israeli soldiers 
arab officials at shifa hospital said the woman najah ahmed 
masoud was shot in the left arm and her daughter huda lost sight 
in her left eye 
arab reports said the injuries came during a melee as ms masoud 
tried to block soldiers from arresting her brother the army said 
it was investigating the report 
the uprisings underground leaders called for todays strike and 
urged their compatriots to fly the outlawed palestinian flag this 
week as president reagan and mikhail s gorbachev meet in moscow 
a complete general strike more confrontations on the occasion 
of the gorbachevreagan summit said a leaflet issued friday 
us ambassador thomas pickering told a meeting in jersusalem on 
sunday that the arabisraeli conflict would be right on the top 
of the list of regional issues discussed at the moscow summit 
palestinian activists have said drawing attention of the 
superpowers to their plight was one victory of the uprising but 
some also admit that support for strikes and street protests is now 
diminishing 
in the gaza strip today shops were open transit was running 
and many people were out on the streets the uprising had the most 
devastating effect in that area until today 
arab reporters said the uprising leaders leaflet calling for 
todays general strike did not reach the gaza strip israel radio 
also reported that few palestinians saw the leaflet 
most businesses were closed in west bank towns and cities and in 
east jerusalem but many workers were reported going to jobs in 
israel and transport was running in some areas 
palestinian flags were flying in nablus the west banks largest 
city and in jenin in bethlehem new graffiti on walls warned 
merchants not to open during the strike 
we are going to burn everybody who will break the strike 
one slogan said 
on sunday the army said israeli soldiers shot and wounded nine 
palestinians in scattered clashes with stonethrowing youths in 
both gaza and the west bank arab newspapers said an arab woman was 
shot to death sunday in the west bank village of jaba where 
protesters set up roadblocks to keep out israeli soldiers 
the army said seven protesters were shot after youths threw 
stones at soldiers and that it was investigating the report of the 
womans death 
an army spokeswoman said today that soldiers sealed four houses 
in the west bank and demolished one house in gazas rafa refugee 
camp in an effort to punish palestinians who attacked israeli 
soldiers 
by un count 198 palestinians have died during the sixmonth 
uprising in the lands israel seized during the 1967 middle east 
war two israelis also have been killed 
todays strike followed claims by israeli leaders that the 
uprising was fading 
shmuel goren the israeli coordinator for the occupied lands 
said in an interview published today that the uprising has made no 
political gains but that israel still has not quelled the anger 
that fueled the violent protests 
theres still a way to go before we significantly undermine 
the motivation he told the jersualem post 
goren said the protests broke out spontaneously not on orders 
from the palestine liberation organization and that it surprised 
even many palestinians 
he said the movement was failing because no alternative 
instiutions have been created even though this was one of the main 
goals of the uprising 
on sunday junior high schools were opened for 70000 west bank 
youngsters in the second stage of a program to resume classes in 
1200 schools shut nearly four months ago because of the uprising 
army officials reported no major trouble as 320 junior highs 
reopened it plans to resume classes in high schools on sunday

mrs reagan visits school has exchange with children 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
nancy reagan defended american students and their 
study habits today when she got a grilling during a minipress 
conference with soviet children at a prestigious middle school 
do american children learn russian queried one child in 
russian as mrs reagan fielded questions during an hourlong visit 
to school no 29 
all children at the school which caters primarily to the 
children of high officials and soviet intelligentsia begin to 
study english at the age of 8 
mrs reagan clearly aware most russian language studies in the 
us are on the high school and college level and that she was 
among the children of many privileged people responded no they 
dont 
but then she parried do all the soviet children in every 
school here study english 
the children immediately broke out in loud argument many 
insisting that indeed all soviet children do learn english 
mrs reagan who holds no press conferences and prefers to deal 
more informally with the press was seated at the head of the class 
as one child after another asked questions some in english some 
in russian about whether us children wear school uniforms play 
football and baseball and have a game like hide and seek 
the first lady who finally remembered with a chuckle that she 
had learned several russian words responded yes yes i mean 
da da at one point 
but she flunked a pronunciation test when the children tried to 
get her to say the russian words for peace earth and sun mir 
zemlya and solnsa and she was able to get one out of three at 
one point throwing up her hands in exasperation 
the 35 children from the firstgrade english class at the school 
entertained the first lady by singing such favorites as yankee 
doodle do re mi and school days as she awaited the 
second round of summit talks between president reagan and mikhail 
s gorbachev 
im very impressed spacibo thank you mrs reagan said 
as she accepted a box of pictures painted by the students 
the first lady apparently made a favorable impression said some 
of the youngsters gathered outside the school and many noted that 
the authorities had spent two weeks cleaning and painting in 
preparation for the visit 
she has a very good smile that is very important said ann 
kaslovskaya a 15yearold student at the school 
after the school visit mrs reagan was driven about 15 miles 
outside town to the wooded retreat peredelkino where she paid a 
brief visit to the grave of famous soviet poet boris pasternak 
reporters were not allowed to view mrs reagans visit which came 
on the 28th anniversary of pasternaks death 
the author of dr zhivago pasternak was awarded the nobel 
prize for literature in 1958 but his fame provoked a bitter 
official campaign against him he was forced to reject the award 
and returned to his dacha in peredelkino where he died in 1960 
the first lady remained in the wooded suburb to have lunch with 
the soviet poet andrei voznesensky an official poet who is widely 
published in the soviet union 
voznesensky who spoke with reporters said he was pleased to 
have the first lady at his home so that she can have an 
understanding of soviet culture and something strange the 
slavic soul 
mrs reagans visit to the suburb came on the second day of her 
visit 
on sunday she met with raisa gorbachev and toured the kremlin 
and its collection of ancient churches and icons 
asked to explain lingering reports they dislike one another 
mrs reagan shot back you explain it to me 
holding hands and smiling the two women put on an elaborate 
show of friendship they dismissed the feuds as rumors but 
when the talk turned to religious activities the soviet first lady 
cut the conversation short 
every time theyve met mrs reagan said weve gotten along 
very well 
on a tour of the ancient russian fortress and its collection of 
golden oniondomed cathedrals the first ladies were also often 
shouldertoshoulder discussing the religious paintings that 
adorned the walls of the cathedral of the assumption as if they 
were a pair of school girls

the rare peal of church bells rang out in moscow 
today as president reagan visited the capitals oldest monastery 
and told the monks he and other americans prayed that perestroika 
would bring religious freedom to the soviet union 
the faith of your people has been tested and tempered in the 
crucible of hardship reagan said we may hope that perestroika 
will be accompanied by a deeper restructuring and that 
glasnost which means giving voice will also let loose a new 
chorus of belief 
our people feel it keenly when religious freedom is denied to 
anyone anywhere and hope with you that soon all the many soviet 
religious communities including the ukrainian catholic and 
orthodox churches will soon be able to practice their religion 
freely and openly he said 
reagan accompanied by his wife nancy also quoted exiled soviet 
author alexander solzhenitsyn who referred to the church bells 
that once sounded through russia 
in our prayers we may keep that image in mind reagan said 
that the bells may ring again someday through moscow and the 
countryside 
church chimes rarely are heard in moscow but rang twice for a 
total of about six minutes during reagans visit once when he and 
his entourage arrived at the 13th century danilov monastery and 
again when they left 
the monastery was closed to worshipers during the visit but 
several hundred soviets crowded against police barricades near the 
monastery and lined the nearby sidewalks during the 30minute 
visit some waving at the american group 
about 18 monks dressed in black robes and wearing gold crosses 
listened to reagans comments and waved goodbye as he drove away 
the monastery has been renovated in the last several years for 
the celebration of the 1000 anniversary of christianity in russia 
which begins next month 
the reagans briefly watched a monk restore a religious icon in 
the cathedral of the holy fathers they were accompanied by 
metropolitan filaret the second highest ranking religious leader 
in the russian orthodox church hierarchy 
the visit to the danilov monastery the seat of the orthodox 
chruchs patriarchate followed reagans second summit session with 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said the visit was planned to symbolize our concern for 
religious freedom 
reagan who had a private conversation sunday with gorbachev 
about human rights has praised progress toward religious freedom 
in the soviet union 
in a speech on may 3 reagan noted that some religious 
dissidents have been allowed to emigrate some new churches have 
been organized and soviet authorities have announced they will 
permit the printing of 100000 bibles 
gorbachev also held an unusual meeting with leaders of the 
russian orthodox church on april 29 to appeal for their support it 
apparently was the first such session since 1943 when stalin 
conferred with church leaders to help rally the country against 
nazi germany during world war ii 
it is unclear however whether gorbachevs new flexibility in 
dealing with the orthodox church signals substantially improved 
conditions for other religious groups in the soviet union 
the danilov monastery was built in the 13th century by the first 
prince of moscow and served as part of the southern defenses of 
moscow after a period of decline it was rebuilt by ivan the 
terrible in the 16th century 
after the russian revolution the soviet government took over 
the monastery and turned the grounds into a factory in may 1983 
the state returned the monastery to the church 
massive renovations were carried out as part of soviet efforts 
to fix up religious monuments for the millennium of christianity in 
ancient russia 
unofficial estimates put the number of religious believers in 
the soviet union at upwards of 90 million people 
this includes 40 million to 50 million adherents of the russian 
orthodox church 10 million eastern rite and roman catholics 4 
million protestants including baptists and pentecostals 2 million 
jews and tens of millions of moslems

mrs broz has lived in virtual seclusion since her husband died 
in 1980 after ruling yugoslavia for 35 years 
in a letter circulated among belgrade intellectuals two years 
ago mrs broz charged that she was evicted from titos residence 
in an exclusive belgrade suburb soon after his death she said she 
was allowed to take what she said were only the most essential 
personal effects

people and wounded 68 
no group claimed reponsibility for the car bomb which exploded 
500 yards from a branch office of president amin gemayels 
rightwing phalange party 
police said the explosion may indicate that moslem and christian 
extremists have launched a new round of retaliatory car bombings in 
lebanons civil war 
the bombing occurred about two miles from beiruts southern 
slums where syrian troops deployed to stop fighting between 
militant shiite moslems 
police said a blue volvo car packed with an estimated 220 pounds 
of tnt blew up in crowded rmaeil street in the ashrafiyeh district

in the road three bulldozers were brought in to remove the debris 
the blast gutted several shops and destroyed the fronts of eight 
apartment buildings more than 20 other buildings were badly 
damaged and at least 30 cars were reduced to piles of smoldering 
twisted metal 
firemen battled several blazes ignited by the explosion and 
ambulances ferried casualties to hospitals radio stations 
broadcast urgent appeals for blood donations severed overhead 
power cables dangled onto the street and broken glass littered the 
area for 300 yards around the blast scene 
phalangist militiamen and others from the lebanese forces the 
christians main militia cordoned off the blast site and fired in 
the air to clear paths for fire engines and ambulances through the 
traffic 
walking past pools of blood a jeweler picked pieces of gold 
bracelets rings and necklaces scattered outside his devastated 
store 
im still alive thats what counts in a country like ours 
he said refusing to give his name 
zeina ghobril 24 a telephone switchboard operator whose home 
was gutted in the blast said my father died six months ago 
leaving us only this house to live in now the house is gone and my 
mother and i have no where to go 
christian and moslems have frequently attacked each other with 
car bombs during lebanons 13yearold civil war killing hundreds 
of people and wounding thousands 
five weeks ago 69 people were killed and 111 wounded in the 
northern port of tripoli a predominantly sunni moslem city 50 
miles north of beirut when a car bomb exploded in a vegetable 
market officials blamed christians 
todays bombing came two days after syrian troops deployed 
throughout beiruts southern slums to stop fighting between shiite 
moslem militias

a ferry boat carrying 172 
passengers and crew ran aground off the southern philippine island 
of mindanao and one person aboard died the coast guard said today 
coast guard spokesman cmdr benjamin palafox said the 72ton 
farida 6 developed engine trouble an hour after departing from 
pagadian city late sunday on a voyage to cotabato city about 560 
miles south of manila 
he said the vessel drifted for about five hours before running 
aground 400 yards from the shore in lanao del norte province 
palafox said all passengers were safe except for a 50yearold 
woman felisa abis who died after apparently suffering a stroke or 
heart attack when the vessel began to list 
initial unconfirmed reports said the ship sank and up to 115 
people were feared drowned but palafox said latest reports refuted 
the claim 
local reporters in pagadian city said they were told early 
monday by the coast guard there that 115 people were feared dead 
later coast guard officials said they merely speculated on the 
figure after receiving a sketchy radio report that the vessel was 
in trouble and may have sunk 
officials said 12 of the 160 passengers were taken by helicopter 
to cotabato city and the rest were brought to karomatan 
last december the passenger ship dona paz collided with an oil 
tanker off mindoro island and more than 3000 people were believed 
to have perished

the governing body of the sikh religion 
today fired all five of the religions high priests and charged 
them with betraying the faith news reports said 
fortysix people mostly radicals were killed when militant 
sikhs occupied the golden temple the religions holiest shrine 
for 10 days beginning may 9 
the standoff ended when indian security forces besieging the 
temple in amritsar attacked and drove out the heavily armed 
terrorists 
the priests were arrested and imprisoned after they tried to 
defy a government curfew on the temple 
the shiromani gurdwara prabandhak committee said today it 
appointed five successors to the priests indian news agencies 
reported the committee met in amritsar the capital of punjab 
state 260 miles north of new delhi 
the 160member governing committee was quoted as saying it fired 
the priests because they had betrayed the sikh faith it did not 
elaborate 
those fired were jasbir singh rode the most senior sikh priest 
swinder singh leader of the keshgarh sahib shrine in punjab 
kashmir singh head priest of the eternal throne which is the 
complex housing the golden temple puran singh head priest of the 
golden temple and jaswant singh head of the damdama sahib shrine 
also in punjab 
all five are in prison in amritsar 
the central government has been pressing the sikh governing body 
to promise in writing that it will not allow the golden temple to 
be used again as a sanctuary by terrorists but the committee so 
far has not responded 
sikhism was founded about 500 years ago as an offshoot of 
hinduism that incorporates elements of the moslem religion 
the sikhs are only 2 percent of indias 800 million people but 
they are a majority in punjab they claim discrimination by the 
hindus who make up 80 percent of the population 
in june 1984 the indian army carried out a massive raid to 
drive militants from the golden temple more than 1200 people were 
killed 
five months later prime minister indira gandhi was assassinated 
by two sikh bodguards in revenge for the raid setting off 
antisikh rioting in which 2000 people died

an official news weekly echoed protesters 
complaints that conservatives are stacking delegates to blunt 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs push to enact reforms at a 
next months communist party conference 
the magazine ogonyok said sunday that party bureaucrats have 
squeezed reformminded people out of seats for the june 28 
conference the first of its kind since 1941 
the magazine reported that one such person is moscow historian 
yuri afanasyev a leading proponent of gorbachevs reforms who has 
also backed an open review of dictator josef v stalins brutal 
abuses of power 
political street demonstrations a rarity were reported in 
moscow and leningrad on saturday they were said to have been 
sparked by reports that midlevel party officials forced slates of 
delegates through party meetings 
the partys policymaking central committee approved conference 
guidelines may 23 calling for limited terms of office for elected 
party officials the central committee also demanded that party 
bureaucrats loosen central control of the government and economy 
the deputy director of the the central committees party 
organizing unit in an interview with the weekly newspaper 
arguments and facts carried by the tass news agency acknowledged 
problems with the selection of delegates 
but the official georgy kryuchnov was quoted as saying one 
can still assert that it is the more respected members of the 
party active stalwarts of perestroika and socialist renewal that 
are being elected to go to the conference 
he said 3000 delegates had been elected by may 25 
but top officials have said the 5000member conference is 
shaping up anyway as a showdown between reformers led by gorbachev 
and those who want to limit change and retain the perquisites of 
privilege 
demonstrators in leningrad and moscow on saturday marched in 
support of the central committees guidelines participants 
reported in telephone calls 
we believe in the good intentions of mikhail sergeyevich 
gorbachev but we have to take perestroika into our own hands 
said one participant in moscow speaking on condition of anonymity 
perestroika is the term for gorbachevs social and economic 
reform program 
in moscow 60 to 80 people marched from the bolshoi theater 
across a broad square from the kremlin to a monument of russian 
poet alexander pushkin 
moscow dissident yuri mitinov said sunday that he thought the 
moscow protesters had acted with official approval for visiting 
journalists covering this weeks ussoviet summit 
he said informal youth groups that organized the activity 
community and citizens dignity never had shown any interest in 
holding demonstrations and misinformed other groups about the 
protest time 
mitinov is a spokesman for the democratic union which advocates 
an end to the communist partys political monopoly and was formed 
this month at meetings attended by scores of people in moscow 
sources in leningrad said up to 2500 people gathered in front 
of the kazan cathedral under banners proclaiming glasnost 
democracy and pluralism the term glasnost is used for 
gorbachevs drive for greater openness and debate in soviet society 
alexander bogdanov a member of democratic union said 
authorities confiscated posters and arrested 31 people at the 
leningrad protest 
the ogonyok article said party bureaucrats are ignoring 
gorbachevs call to prepare for the party conference in open 
meetings 
officials in one party section of moscow announced may 16 that 
the selection of delegates would take place two days later it said 
it is not necessary to say that in such a short period of 
time it was impossible to carry out any kind of wide debate on the 
candidates ogonyok said 
in the siberian city of omsk party officials published a list 
of 37 candidates and the same day held a meeting at which the full 
slate was approved it said 
there is a very difficult struggle between those who back 
perestroika and those who dont said economist nikolai shmelev 
in a meeting with reporters friday but he said some delegates who 
support gorbachevs reforms were being selected as candidates for 
the conference

port officials today delayed unloading a 
freighter carring about 12000 drums of toxic chemical wastes after 
port workers went on strike to protest fumes from the ship of 
poison 
the officials said the syrian freighter zanoobia would not be 
unloaded until the chemicals are analyzed and damaged containers 
are repacked a process that could take several weeks 
four crewmen were treated at a hospital for nausea and stomach 
pains possibly caused by months of exposure to its toxic cargo 
for 15 months the chemicals had roamed the seas in search of a 
port that would dispose of its 2200 tons of italianproduced toxic 
chemical wastes djibouti venezuela syria and greece were tried 
and refused 
lawyers for the ships owner tabalo shipping say two people 
have died possibly after being contaminated by the wastes a boy 
in venezuela and a zanoobia crewman during the voyage to italy 
the zanoobia the third ship to carry the chemicals docked in 
genoa on sunday after officials agreed to accept and incinerate the 
toxic cargo the italian press is calling it the ship of poison 
the ship was moved today to a more isolated dock after hundreds 
of port workers walked off their jobs to protest the smell unions 
said the protest prevented the unloading of seven other freighters 
ahmed tabalo the captain of zanoobia said some of the drums of 
unidentified chemical waste are damaged and may be leaking 
chemicals 
three of the crewmen examined at the hospital today were 
released but one was admitted for observation doctors at san 
martino hospital said 
five crewmen were hospitalized earlier this month with symptoms 
possibly caused by exposure to the wastes 
the condition of my crew is very bad tabalo said after the 
ship docked in genoa for three months we have not entered a 
port now we are all nauseous and sick to the stomach 
the zanoobia had been moored outside the northern italian port 
of carrara since april 26 seeking permission to unload the cargo 
orginally shipped from carrara in february 1987 
francesco rizzuto a lawyer for tabalo shipping said a group of 
italian chemical companies paid the milanbased company jelly wax 
about 36 cents a pound to dispose of the waste he said the company 
instead shipped the waste out of the country 
the waste was sent first to djibouti in east africa which 
refused the waste the cargo was unloaded in venezuela but a young 
boy died reportedly after playing near an opened drum and the 
government ordered the waste shipped out of the country a lawyer 
for the zanoobias owners said 
it was sent to syria and then on to greece after being refused 
in both places the ship sailed to carrara 
a zanoobia crewman died during the trip from greece to carrara 
and lawyers for tabalo shipping have asked italian prosecutors to 
file charges against jelly wax if the death resulted from 
contamination 
officials said the wastes will be burned at a local incinerator 
at a cost of between 72 cents and 186 a pound

deployment of syrian troops in beiruts southern slums the troops 
were sent in to end three weeks of fighting between shiite moslem 
factions 
the newspaper gave no other details 
the four men were abducted jan 24 last year from the campus of 
the usaffiliated beirut university college by gunmen posing as

barracks in the hay madi district where most of the hostages are

president reagan told soviet dissidents and 
refuseniks today the time is ripe to press for human rights because 
kremlin leaders appear to grasp the connection between certain 
freedoms and economic growth 
speaking to several dozen dissidents gathered in spaso house in 
us embassy compound after visiting a 13th century monastary 
reagan said that while there have been hopeful signs of 
improvement in the soviet union there can be no relenting for us 
now we must work for more always more 
i came here to give you strength but it is you who have 
strengthened me the president said in a meeting that some soviet 
officials had criticized as going to far to criticize internal 
affairs in the country 
while we press for human lives through diplomatic channels 
you press with your very lives day in and day out risking your 
homes your jobs and your all reagan told the group in remarks 
which brought occasional applause from his audience 
we hope that one freedom will lead to another the president 
said saying he hopes soviet leaders realize that economic growth 
hinges to a large degree on individual initiative 
an individual soviet citizen reagan said must sense that the 
government respects him enough to grant him all his human 
rights 
during the session interrupted from time to time by the giggles 
of children reagan was besieged by requests to sign his autograph 
on placecards 
several people who attended the 55minute session praised reagan 
for meeting with them and drawing attention to their plight 
i am very impressed that human rights problems have such a 
high standing outside our country said judith lurie a refusenik 
who has been denied permission to leave the soviet union because 
she is jewish 
all of our friends who know about this meeting were very happy 
about it she said 
gleb yakunin a russian orthodox priest who spoke at the meeting 
with reagan and his wife nancy said the president talks 
directly to us about human rights it is clear that he is sincere 
as a person he showed that this is not just a formal matter for 
him 
yakunin was sentenced to five years in exile in 1980 but the 
soviet government relented last year freed him and assigned him a 
parish 
in advance of reagans arrival from his visit to the danilov 
monastery roughly 100 guests had their names checked against a 
list of invitees and soviet police let them inside the new embassy 
compound spaso house is a halfmile ride from the entrance to the 
american facility 
us officials kept secret the identity and even the number of 
the guests expected to meet reagan apparently fearful that soviet 
authorities would interefere with dissidents invited to the 
presidents moscow residence 
at least one guest roald alec zelichonok a leningrad jew 
refused permission to emigrate for more than 10 years reported 
last week that soviet security police had warned him not to travel 
to moscow to meet with reagan 
moscow refuseniks have not reported any similar warnings but 
us embassy officials said they had made arrangements to pick the 
guests up at a city meeting point and drive them together to spaso 
house the us ambassadors residence where reagan is staying 
on sunday reagan considered making a private visit to a 
refusenik family the ziemans but us officials scrubbed the trip 
after the soviets indicated it could damage the familys chance to 
emigrate after 11 years of waiting for an exit visa 
the ziemans said they planned to attend mondays reception and 
yuri zieman said other refuseniks invited included benjamin 
charney who has campaigned for a visa for medical treatment in the 
west and yuli kosharovsky who has been waiting for 17 years to 
emigrate 
at the white house reagan has received some of the most 
wellknown soviet dissidents allowed to leave the country 
including jewish activists natan sharansky and yuri orlov a member 
of the moscow group founded to monitor soviet compliance with the 
helsinki act 
andrei sakharov once the soviet unions most wellknown 
dissident did not attend the reception but has been invited to 
the reagans formal dinner for gorbachev on tuesday night 
sakharov who turned 67 on may 21 has restricted his contacts 
with western diplomats and journalists since he returned to moscow 
in december 1986 from internal exile in the closed city of gorky 
but he still speaks out on human rights issues in the soviet union 
calling for the release of political prisoners and the ending of 
psychiatric abuse 
many other figures have emerged to campaign for more political 
freedom in the soviet union and for the rights of jews and others 
seeking to emigrate and most are thought to have been invited to 
meet reagan 
sergei grigoryants founder of an independent journal called 
glasnost was among those at the reception another former 
political prisoner lev timofeyev also was invited 
reagans dissident meeting was preceded by a visit to moscows 
danilov monastery where he greeted representatives of the 
officially tolerated russian orthodox church 
the church which adheres to limits imposed by the officially 
atheist state has come into the limelight even in staterun media 
recently following a unique kremlin meeting between mikhail s 
gorbachev and the head of the russian orthodox church patriarch 
pimen 
but religious activists like alexander ogorodnikov who was 
among the 300 or so political prisoners released from soviet labor 
camps last year were to have a chance to tell reagan about 
religious activities outside the confines of the statesanctioned 
churches at mondays reception 
reagan has made restrictions on religion a focus in his 
statements on human rights leading up to the summit listing them 
first in a human rights speech given in chicago may 4 
grigoryants who was jailed for a week after a police raid on 
his independent newspaper may 7 will give reagan some pointers on 
his second area of human rights concern freedom of speech

delegates to a national communist 
party conference said today that party leaders should be ousted if 
they fail to end the nations economic crisis the staterun news 
agency said 
the leadership will either fulfill the desire of the people or 
the people will replace it serbian party leader slobodan 
milosevic was quoted by the tanjug news agency as telling the 
delegates 
he did not elaborate but his comments appeared to refer to 
members of the partys central committee and the ruling politburo 
unless we carry through a complete social reform by next 
autumn it will be necessary to call a special party congress 
milosevic said echoing similar calls from other delegates 
the special congress which would likely be held at the end of 
the year would study why the resolutions of a party congress held 
two years ago had not been implemented 
a party congress which would bring together several thousand 
delegates would have substantial power to make personnel and party 
rule changes the role of a party conference is largely advisory 
dimitrije kocovic a delegate from belgrade attacked former and 
current party leaders for not implementing economic changes 
suggested at the last party congress 
the greatest responsibility for this is borne by presidents of 
presidiums of the central committee in this period milanko 
renovica and bosko krunic kocovic said 
the threeday conference began sunday amid a growing economic 
crisis that has caused widespread social unrest and provoked 
unpopular austerity measures 
the government on saturday launched a major austerity program 
that included substantial price increases wage cuts of up to 30 
percent and a 24 percent devaluation of the dinar the national 
currency 
yugoslavia has been saddled with 170 percent inflation a 21 
billion foreign debt and a 15 percent unemployment rate 
the new austerity measures are expected to further erode 
yugoslavias standard of living and set off a new wave of social 
unrest following sporadic strikes in anticipation of the 
belttightening moves 
party chief krunic on saturday said hard times would continue 
and that social upheavals are certain to take place and may be 
grave 
but krunic in his speech to 800 delegates rejected calls for a 
multiparty system to help solve the nations political crisis 
krunic made it clear that the league of communists or communist 
party intended to keep oneparty rule but added that deeper and 
more daring changes in the political system must be made to 
regain public confidence in the party 
during todays debate tanjug quoted simeon buncic a delegate 
of the yugoslav armed forces as saying that yugoslavia faced the 
most critical stage of its socialist development 
drago subotic a delegate from sarajevo in bosniaherzegovina 
demanded that all those about whom the press negatively wrote 
must leave the central committee and its presidium politburo as 
soon as possible tanjug said 
jovan djordjevic a worker from the city of nis in serbia said 
workers and young people are losing faith in the party 
while the workers are becoming socialist paupers there is an 
increasing number of billionaires and private aircraft 
djordjevic was quoted as saying 
the threeday conference follows rumors of an attempted national 
military takeover to suppress dissent in slovenia yugoslavias 
most advanced republic the government denied the rumors 
earlier this month slovenia filed an unsuccessful motion in the 
federal parliament requesting the removal of premier branko mikulic 
a society which enters such a crisis cannot emerge from it 
without profound changes said the party chief on sunday 
social upheavals are certain to take place and may be grave 
compounding yugoslavias economic problems are unresolved ethnic 
tensions in this mostly balkan nation its republics range from the 
southern serbian province of kosovo with its 85 percent albanian 
population to northern slovenia which borders austria and italy

likely democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis today promised black supporters that jesse jackson would be 
offered a major role at the partys convention and in the fall 
campaign 
dukakis according to participants in a breakfast meeting 
attended by about 100 black supporters from across the country 
also promised an increased black presence in his national and state 
campaign organizations 
i think we can put together as strong a coalition that has 
ever been put together in any presidential campaign dukakis told 
reporters after the session which was closed to the media 
this is now the beginning of a major effort that we will be 
making all across america dukakis said he was not specific 
about what role he would offer jackson but said he expected the 
civil rights leaders support 
former new orleans mayor dutch morial described the session as 
candid and said the black dukakis supporters would work to 
assure that black jackson supporters do not defect to bush 
after the session dukakis attended a wreathlaying ceremony as 
part of local memorial day services in boston 
on sunday dukakis told new jersey environmentalists mistakes he 
made as governor would make him a stronger president 
dukakis spent the day in new jersey decrying ocean dumping of 
trash sludge and untreated sewage and called for national programs 
to promote recycling and conservation 
its pretty disgusting dukakis said about the polluted 
waters off new jersey which he saw while aboard the ss miss 
belmar a large charter boat based in the new jersey shore town of 
belmar 
dukakis called for an active federal role in the cleanup of 
polluted waterways and conceded he had made a mistake by delaying 
for more than a decade the cleanup of boston harbor a project that 
now will cost more than 3 billion 
nobody is without sin dukakis told reporters aboard the 
boat let he who is without sin cast the first stone he said 
later when asked whether new jersey and new york officials had 
ignored pollution of waters off those states 
dukakis denounced president reagans environmental policies 
saying the president came to washington intent on destroying the 
environmental protection agency and has allowed his interior 
department secretaries to encourage ridiculous plans to drill 
offshore for petroleum and natural gas 
its going to take a president and the congress and an 
environmental protection agency that understands what the law is 
and takes its job seriously to make a difference dukakis said 
he said state and local governments would have to pay the bulk 
of the costs of environmental programs but said an active federal 
government could provide grants loans and technical assistance 
in his first term as governor in the mid1970s dukakis balked at 
an early plan to clean up boston harbor which the epa ranks as the 
nations filthiest a reaganappointed epa regional director in 
washington has gone to federal court several times in the past two 
years to get the dukakis administration to hasten the pace of the 
current cleanup 
after the boat cruise dukakis attended a barbecue in linden 
twice during that appearance he said god had created a beautiful 
environment that man should not destroy dukakis who rarely refers 
to god or religion in his speeches is under attack from a 
conservative group that claims he has exploited greek americans for 
fundraising but has not been a practicing member of the 
greekorthodox church 
dukakis had declined comment when asked saturday about the 
conservative effort which includes mass mailing of a letter 
calling him a pagan and he was not available for comment after his 
appearance at the barbecue 
while in new jersey dukakis also attended three private 
sessions an environmental forum a meeting with hispanic leaders 
and a reception for a democratic state senator running for congress 
dukakis was to return to new jersey later this week for a day of 
campaigning before heading to california for several days he also 
plans stops in new mexico and montana those four states hold the 
final primaries on june 7 when dukakis could pick up enough 
delegates to gain a mathematical lock on the nomination

democratic presidential frontrunner michael dukakis launching 
a drive a shore up minority support for the november election 
promised black supporters today that jesse jackson will be offered 
a major role at both the democratic convention and in the fall 
campaign 
the massachusetts governor in a breakfast meeting in boston 
with 100 black supporters from across the nation also promised to 
boost the black presence in his national and state campaign 
organizations participants said 
on sunday jackson his only remaining rival sent dukakis a 
reminder that it will take both of us to win 
dukakis told reporters after the closed session with black 
officials i think we can put together as strong a coalition that 
has ever been put together in any presidential campaign 
this is now the beginning of a major effort that we will be 
making all across america dukakis said he was not specific 
about what role he has in mind for jackson 
certain republican nominee george bush at his summer home in 
maine was marching in a memorial day parade today and continuing a 
weeklong strategy session with aides and gop officials 
the vice presidents advisers are working on ways to shore up 
his standing against dukakis who has been consistently outpolling 
bush in public opinion surveys 
the bush camp indicated over the weekend that the vice president 
would begin attacking the massachusetts governor more aggressively 
and moving away from president reagan on some issues 
with the democratic primary season heading into its final week 
dukakis and jackson both campaigned sunday in new jersey one of 
four states staging contests on june 7 the new jersey race plus 
primaries in california new mexico and montana offers a total of 
466 delegates 
dukakis with more than 1700 delegates is within striking 
distance of the 2081 needed to nominate while jackson trails with 
less than 1000 delegates 
the massachusetts governor expects to clinch the delegates he 
needs with the final round of primaries and a continuing stream of 
commitments from super delegates who vote at the convention by 
virtue of their party or elective office 
jackson is signalling that he knows its almost the end of the 
road for his presidential bid 
when the race is over june 7 life goes on june 8 he said 
as he campaigned in new jersey but his pride was evident as he 
told a crowd we should never forget this campaign 
and jackson has been making it clear that even if the nomination 
is out of reach he expects to play a major part in shaping the 
democratic platform he is also indicating that the massive black 
support he has garnered in primary contests to date shouldnt be 
taken for granted by the democratic nominee 
its going to take the both of us to win said jackson 
referring to himself and dukakis together were gonna win 
dukakis took a boat cruise with environmentalists who showed 
him polluted waters off new jersey on sunday last summer new 
jersey beaches were closed on several occasions by pollution 
including sewage and hospital waste that washed ashore 
its pretty disgusting said the governor on viewing trash 
and sludge in the water off asbury park 
but dukakis acknowledged that he himself had been slow in 
starting a cleanup of filthy boston harbor the environmental 
protection agency finally got a court order to speed things up 
nobody is without sin the governor said 
dukakis record as governor of massachusetts has been coming 
under close scrutiny and some backers of bush say theres plenty 
of potential ammunition new hampshire gov john sununu who met 
with bush over the weekend at kennebunkport cited management 
failures of the dukakis administration and said those would 
become campaign issues 
bush in turn has come under fire for weeks from both jackson 
and dukakis over the administrations dealings with panamas gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
jackson was on the attack again over the weekend suggesting 
that reagan wanted a deal to get noriega out of power to silence 
him before the moscow summit which began sunday 
dukakis marked the start of the summit by saying he believed the 
soviet unions economic problems led soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev to agree to arms reductions 
i think that is the driving force behind this the recognition 
on his part that theyre falling further and further behind 
theyre losing the economic race the technological race and that 
they cannot be a great nation unless they significantly reduce the 
amount of resources theyre putting into the military he said in 
an interview with the british broadcasting corp 
the interview was taped last week while dukakis campaigned in 
california he was heading back to the state for more campaigning 
later this week 
attorney general edwin meese iiis legal problems continued to 
dog the bush campaign white house chief of staff howard baker said 
sunday that president reagan still has confidence in meese but 
believes meeses legal problems could harm bush politically for 
the moment and to some degree 
but i think that he too would urge you to wait and see how all 
this unfolds and develops baker added in the interview with 
nbcs meet the press

opposition leaders said today they 
might finally be able to field candidates in elections ushered in 
by president mohammad zia ulhaqs surprise dismissal of the 
government 
zia on sunday dissolved the national assembly fired prime 
minister mohammad khan junejo and dismissed junejos 33member 
cabinet he said they had failed to maintain law and order and 
promote an islamic society 
the president did not elaborate on his reasons for disbanding 
the government an action he announced just minutes after junejo 
returned from a toru of china south korea and the philippines 
the official media also announced the dissolution of provincial 
assemblies in punjab sind baluchistan and northwest frontier 
province 
junejo today criticized zia for dismissing the assembly and his 
cabinet and said his party the pakistan muslim league will win 
upcoming elections 
junejo told a news conference the dissolution of the national 
assembly by the president is an action taken completely 
arbitrarily and solely on his own the action is against the 
fundamentals of the democratic process 
in 1984 elections political parties were not allowed to field 
candidates and opposition parties boycotted the voting 
but zia an army general said sunday that new elections will be 
held within 90 days in which political parties will be allowed to 
propose their own candidates for assembly seats 
the pledge indicated that for the first time since zia seized 
power in a bloodless 1977 coup opposition parties might be allowed 
to participate 
the 64yearold president was to address the nation later today 
to announce a caretaker government he said sunday that the senate 
the upper house of parliament would remain intact 
junejos was the first civilian cabinet since martial law 
imposed by zia in 1977 was lifted eight years later 
benazir bhutto leader of the opposition pakistan peoples 
party was quoted today in the englishlanguage newspaper the 
muslim as saying she welcomes zias move but still has doubts 
we will wait until the rules of the game are spelled out 
she was quoted as saying 
her father zulfikar ali bhutto was a prime minister toppled by 
zia and hanged in 1979 on a murder conspiracy conviction 
ethnic riots in southern sind province and the port city of 
karachi have killed hundreds of people over the past two years 
since zia lifted martial law and handed limited power over to 
junejos muslim league government 
the government dismissal came less than two weeks before the 
assembly was to debate a new budget in which zia was expected to 
request substantial increases in military spending 
in an editorial the promuslim league newspaper the nation 
wrote today that the dismissals came as a total surprise and as 
an ironic anticlimax to mr junejos ardent speeches to foreign 
audiences about how well the country was doing and democracy 
thriving under him 
other englishlanguage newspapers quoted opposition leaders as 
being surprised but optimistic 
one western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said 
he was stunned by the presidents moves although he had heard 
rumors the past few days of a possible government shakeup 
junejo 56 his cabinet and the national assembly were scheduled 
to remain in office until 1990 they were elected in the nonparty 
elections boycotted by the opposition in dec 1984 junejo was 
appointed prime minister in march 1985

not one medal of honor went to any of the 15 
million blacks who fought in world wars i and ii a fact historian 
leroy ramsey wants to change 
ramsey has found the records of two black servicemen he says 
deserve the medal sgt henry johnson of albany ny and seaman 
dorrie miller of waco texas johnson served in the army during 
world war i miller was in the navy in the second world war both 
have since died 
it was an accident that ramsey also of albany discovered no 
blacks had won the nations highest military honor for bravery 
during the world wars although blacks have won the medal for 
heroic deeds in other wars it was also a discovery born of anger 
in 1984 i was watching television when they celebrated the 
40th anniversary of dday in europe he said in a telephone 
interview last week the president was over there and the whole 
week was as white as a ku klux klan rally 
a black world war ii veteran himself ramsey got angry that his 
experience of the war was not recognized but turned that emotion 
into a useful pursuit 
i decided to do a book on the black american in world war ii 
and when i got into my research i began to realize that no black 
had received the medal of honor in either world war i or world war 
ii said ramsey a former associate history professor at hofstra 
university on long island so i put the book on the back burner 
and took off on an effort to see if i could get that righted 
ramsey looked at the records of black servicemen who had won 
other high military honors including the distinguished service 
cross and the french croix de guerre he looked into the history of 
the navys medal of honor established by congress in 1861 and the 
armys established in 1862 and he said he read the more than 
1200 citations of the medal of honor since its inception to 
make sure i was on solid ground 
i didnt want this to be token because these guys were 
black he said i didnt want any compromising of principle on 
the medal of honor 
ramsey discovered that johnson who fought with the french army 
killed four german soldiers rescued a wounded comrade and captured 
a stockpile of weapons all despite severe combat wounds for his 
actions johnson earned the croix de guerre frances highest 
military honor he died in 1930 
miller served at pearl harbor aboard the uss west virginia 
ramsey said when the japanese attacked miller a mess steward 
helped move his mortally wounded captain from the ships bridge 
then returned to man a machine gun according to ramseys research 
afterward the secretary of the navy awarded miller a letter of 
commendation but adm chester nimitz commander in hawaii 
upgraded that to the navy cross the secondhighest award ramsey 
said miller was killed in 1943 in a torpedo attack 
ramsey built up his case but for two years he couldnt get any 
public official to listen he sent copies of a 21page letter to 
every member of the new york and texas congressional delegations 
but 102 percent of those people ignored the hell out of me 
it would have been easier for me to get a boy scout merit 
badge for a communist he said 
finally he received a letter of support from rep mario biaggi 
dny but biaggi became embroiled in criminal trials in new york 
and ramseys cause languished until new york gov mario cuomo 
decided it had merit 
cuomo wrote me a very long letter and he took the time to 
personally write each member of the congressional delegation in 
washington and ask them to help me ramsey said 
then as if a voice from the dark joe dioguardi came through 
and the effort never stopped 
last october dioguardi a republican congressman from 
westchester county ny and rep mickey leland dtexas 
cosponsored bills to waive the statute of limitations for the medal 
of honor so both men can be considered for the award 
in the cases of miller and johnson both the navy and army have 
opposed the bills which are now before the house armed services 
committee dioguardi said 
the navy did not specify why according to dioguardi but the 
army laid out several reasons in a letter to rep les aspin 
dwisc who is chairman of the armed services committee 
delbert l spurlock assistant secretary of the army for 
manpower and reserve affairs wrote that while others including 
members of congress had written to the army requesting special 
consideration for johnson at this late date it would be 
inappropriate to single out former sergeant johnson for award of 
the medal of honor and to provide preferential treatment to him 
over the thousands of other black soldiers who served so bravely in 
combat 
spurlock also said that johnsons records were destroyed in a 
fire in 1973 at the armys national personnel records center 
although ramsey said he obtained certified copies from archives in 
new york state 
dioguardi said he would not give up the fight

for nearly a year rep newt gingrich battled 
long odds pitting his tart tongue and bulldog tenacity against the 
raw political power of the nations top elected democrat 
in a stream of letters press conferences and closeofbusiness 
speeches on the house floor the georgia conservative waged war 
against the personal ethics of house speaker jim wright 
wright rarely responded and until last week gingrich had been 
unable to persuade even one republican colleague to join in his 
call for a house ethics committee investigation of wright 
that changed suddenly when common cause a nonpartisan watchdog 
group wrote the ethics committee may 18 asking for an 
investigation to determine whether wright had violated federal 
ethics rules 
having common cause come out changed the whole dynamics and 
legitimized the issue gingrich said in an interview last week 
within a week vice president george bush had called for the 
appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate wrights 
financial dealings and gingrich had enlisted 73 other house 
republicans including most of the gop leadership to support his 
formal complaint against wright to the ethics committee 
wright also took notice telling reporters his views of gingrich 
are similar to those of a fire hydrant toward dogs 
wright charged that the pressure for an investigation was part 
of an orchestrated gop effort to embarrass democrats and to draw 
attention away from the legal problems of attorney general edwin 
meese iii and other reagan administration officials 
in responding to those charges gingrich invariably turns to his 
newly acquired common cause defense 
the most extraordinary moment of the last two weeks was the 
speakers staffs description of common cause as the handmaiden of 
people like newt gingrich he said no one in this city takes 
seriously the idea that common cause in engaged in a desperate 
effort to take attention away from ed meese 
common cause officials say theyre not concerned that their 
request for an investigation of wright is being used by republicans 
to deflect charges that their own campaign against wright is 
motivated by partisan politics 
our concern is the merits of the ethics issue said randy 
huwa vice president of common cause we felt that questions had 
been raised that should be addressed by the ethics committee 
thats why we took the action that we did and others are going to 
have to speak for themselves 
our role in this is not a partisan one he said weve got 
an 18year history of nonpartisanship we have called for 
investigations of democrats and republicans thats our charter 
thats our responsiblity 
the committee is scheduled to meet thursday to discuss whether 
to begin a preliminary investigation gingrichs complaint asks for 
an investigation in three areas 
reports that wright intervened with egyptian president anwar 
sadat in 1979 in behalf of a texas businessman who weeks earlier 
had permitted wright to invest in a proven oil well 
reports that wright attempted to influence a department of 
interior gas lease decision in 1979 in favor of a company in which 
he owned 15000 worth of stock 
reports that wright received unusually high 55 percent 
royalties on his book reflections of a public man which was 
published by a printing company that did 300000 worth of work for 
wrights campaign committee in 198586 
common cause asked for an investigation into the financial 
arrangements surrounding wrights book and into reports that he had 
improperly attempted to influence federal bank regulators on behalf 
of texas constituents and democratic contributors 
wright has denied any wrongdoing and has promised to cooperate 
fully if the ethics committee decides to investigate him in the 
meantime he and his democratic allies in the house have launched a 
counterattack against gingrich 
the democratic congressional campaign committee charged last 
week that gingrich received 13000 from wealthy friends in 1977 
for a novel he never wrote rep beryl anthony dark chairman of 
the dccc said the partnership arrangement provided gingrich with 
a means for financial gain not available to the average 
american 
the dccc earlier this year complained to the federal election 
commission that conservatives for hope and opportunity a political 
action committee headed by gingrich had violated federal campaign 
laws the fec last week dismissed the complaint

nancy reagan got a glimpse of the soviet unions 
slavic soul monday by visiting the beloved woods of famed 
russian poet boris pasternak on the 28th anniversary of his death 
the first lady a longtime admirer of the nobelprize winners 
dr zhivago said the noontime visit to the wooded moscow 
suburb of peredelkino impressed me greatly it was very very 
touching 
mrs reagans second day in the capital of communism included a 
visit to an english class at a prestigious moscow middle school 
where she admitted that the russian language was a tonguetwister 
for her all i have been able to manage so far is spasibo thank 
you she confessed 
the first ladys us limousine was accompanied about a dozen 
official soviet cars and she was whisked down a cleared highway to 
the suburb about 15 miles outside of the soviet capital 
peredelkino is a favorite wooded retreat sprinkled with elegant old 
frame dachas provided by the state for the use of the 
intelligentsia and other favored citizens 
she was treated to a lunch of caviar potatoes borsht coffee 
and fresh vegetables by the official poet andrei voznesensky who 
invited mrs reagan to his peachcolored dacha nestled among the 
pine and birch trees 
i think for the american leaders wife to come to our 
country to visit the grave of pasternak this is very important 
said voznesensky attired in a silk neck scarf light grey pants 
white shirt and white and grey striped jacket came to the gate of 
his home to greet the first lady 
voznesensky who is a widely published author in the soviet 
union and is a big supporter of gorbachevs reform efforts told 
reporters it was important for mrs reagan to learn the differences 
between the two nations 
americans have computers and technology he said but the 
russians have russian poetry and something strange the slavic 
soul you learn about this with poetry 
he added that such poetry is like religion for the soviets 
pasternak was the object of much controversy in the soviet 
union even years after his death in 1960 he had been awarded the 
nobel prize for literature in 1958 but his fame provoked a bitter 
official campaign against him he was forced to reject the award 
and returned to his dacha where he died of cancer 
prior to the lunch mrs reagan walked from her limousine down a 
short path to pasternaks grave which lies on the edge of a large 
treed cemetery across from a pair of potato fields us officials 
said a dirt road near the site had apparently been covered in 
asphalt for the visit 
reporters were not allowed to view her at the gravesite but her 
spokeswoman elaine crispen said the first lady placed flowers on 
the fencedin grave as pasternaks son yevgeniy stood by and 
softly hummed a requiem 
mrs reagan toured school no 29 and peredelkino while president 
reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev continued their 
summit talks in the kremlin on monday mrs reagan had toured the 
ancient fortress and its iconfilled churches in the company of 
raisa gorbachev and on tuesday she planned to spend the day touring 
the baltic capital of peter the great leningrad 
at the school mrs reagan defended us students and their 
study habits when she got a grilling at a minipress conference 
with soviet children 
do american children learn russian queried one child in 
russian as mrs reagan fielded questions during an hourlong visit 
to school no 29 
all children at the school which caters primarily to the 
children of highranking officials and soviet intelligentsia begin 
to study english at the age of 8 
mrs reagan clearly aware most russian language studies in the 
us are on the high school and college and that she was among the 
children of soviet privileged responded no they dont 
but then she parried do all the soviet children in every 
school here study english 
the children immediately broke out in loud argument many 
insisting that indeed all soviet children do learn english 
the first lady who finally remembered with a chuckle that she 
had learned several russian words responded yes yes i mean 
da da at one point 
but she flunked a pronunciation test when the children tried to 
get her to say the russian words for peace earth and sun mir 
zemlya and solnsa and she was able to get only one out of three 
at one point she threw up her hands in exasperation

the communist party newspaper pravda said monday 
it hoped the improvement in superpower relations was more than a 
maneuver by president reagan to help republican prospects in the 
us presidential election 
pictures and reports of the first day of reagans visit to 
moscow dominated the front pages of pravda and the government 
newspaper izvestia the only two national papers to publish monday 
pravda said the two countries are carrying out a 
businesslike constructive dialogue the agreement on medium and 
shorterrange missiles the first in history concerning elimination 
of nuclear weapons already has been signed and ratified 
one would like to hope that behind this are not just manuevers 
in the race for votes for his republican party but also an 
ability to discard outlived notions for the sake of progress 
pravda said 
izvestia normally an evening paper published a morning edition 
in which the entire first page except for a small space across the 
bottom was devoted to the meeting between reagan and soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev 
pravda printed a picture of the us and soviet flags flying 
together next to its headline announcing reagans visit both 
papers gave prominent play to pictures of the two leaders with 
their wives and seated together at the beginning of their talks

how do you know the summit is being held in 
moscow when the sign on the wall says attention this is a 
nonsecure area 
the signs are posted in the white house press offices outpost 
at the hotel mezhdunarodnaya where the soviets have set up the 
international center for reporters many members of the press and 
some of the top officials are also quartered at the hotel 
officials are warned this area is not safe for sensitive 
conversation or reading of classified material 
the us government has long been concerned about the soviets 
ability to eavesdrop electronically on conversations 
but officials at the state department and the white house said 
they are confident that conversations held by the president and his 
aides either at the embassy or spaso house the us ambassadors 
residence were reagan is staying will be private 
the government flew in sensitive encryption and communications 
equipment and reinforced some rooms with shields to make them 
impervious officials said earlier

americans may have written to soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev by the thousands but they are not lining up 
to buy the book of their letters the collection of american 
missives to the kremlin boss went on sale at the start of the 
summit here but only one buyer has come forward 
progress publishers printed 2000 copies of americans write to 
gorbachev and put the first stack on sale at the press center 
for the ussoviet summit that began sunday 
the books sell for only 210 rubles 350 but the progress 
kiosk takes only hard currency 
most russians have no access to convertible currency and since 
the book has been issued only in russian language it has found 
little market among those able to pay for it 
asked how many copies had been sold by midday tuesday the 
soviet salesman replied exactly one 
the books publication was announced earlier this month in an 
article by sovietskaya kultura which said gorbachev received more 
than 80000 letters from americans last year

two democrats are battling to become new 
jerseys first black congressman by succeeding rep peter rodino 
who spent 40 years championing civil rights but was pressured to 
step down to give his district minority representation 
rodino a democrat announced in march that he would resign at 
the end of his term closing a colorful political era that began 
when he took office in 1948 
rodino had become an institution in new jersey and washington 
and climbed to national prominence as chairman of the impeachment 
hearings against former president richard nixon 
rodino consistently scored big victories even as his heavily 
democratic 10th districts once italian neighborhoods changed to 
black hispanic and portuguese 
since the early 1970s the district has been predominantly black 
and hispanic 
the drive to oust rodino left a bitter aftertaste because of the 
efforts racial some say racist overtones 
the issue no longer is whether this district can elect a black 
congressman said keith jones president of the states naacp 
the question is whether they can serve as well as peter rodino 
the june 7 democratic primary pits newark city councilman donald 
payne 53 vice president of a computer forms manufacturing 
company against fellow councilman ralph grant a teacher of 
sociology at the new jersey institute of technology 
the democratic primary winner is expected to easily turn back a 
challenge from republican michael webb who also is black in the 
general election in the urban district that includes newark webb 
who has never held elected office is unopposed in the gop primary 
some of paynes backing this year emerged even before rodino 
announced his retirement creating an uneasy situation for local 
leaders who didnt want to put too much pressure on rodino a 
champion of civil rights and still popular among voters 
rodino served as house floor manager for the landmark civil 
rights act of 1966 and wrote the 1982 voting rights act he is an 
honorary member of the congressional black caucus and has been 
honored by the naacp 
payne was endorsed in the 1986 primary against rodino by the 
rev jesse jackson although the prominent presidential hopeful has 
remained neutral in this years primary many believe the previous 
endorsement has a lingering effect 
touring the district with jackson in 1986 payne said it was 
time for the district to elect its first black representative 
payne took 36 percent of the vote that year far short of rodinos 
60 percent 
in a recent interview payne defended his 1986 call to replace 
rodino with a member of a minority group and denied that racism was 
at work 
we felt that we had to address one of the biggest problems in 
america said payne large numbers of people are feeling 
theyre not part of the system i wanted to show black 
youngsters that they are not being left out 
rodino brought much of the pressure on himself saying in his 
1986 campaign that he would serve until president reagan left 
office in january 1989 
but after the election rodino surprised many democratic leaders 
by throwing fundraisers and backing off his campaign statement 
this didnt stop some from pressing rodino to retire state 
senate president john russo endorsed payne before rodinos 
retirement announcement and newark mayor sharpe james said he 
supported a minority representative for the district 
the three major hopefuls for the office speak glowingly of 
rodinos service even gop contender webb said he had voted for 
rodino 
the candidates have the same platform fight drugs house the 
homeless help the elderly and bring in jobs the campaign is 
focusing on records and personalities 
both democrats support jackson for president

when the going gets tough republican 
politicians send for roger ailes the blunt rotund media maven 
who has molded images from nixon to reagan his assignment this 
year george bush 
the job as several national polls attest is not going to be 
easy and so here is ailes holed up in a bare office a few blocks 
from the white house attempting to perform once again the miracles 
that led one observer to dub him dr ailes 
im a guy who can help balance the scene a little bit says 
ailes a top bush strategist as well as the vice presidents 
television coach and advertising consultant i see myself as a 
fellow who works for the underdog 
ailes is a powerful player who insists that his role in the bush 
campaign is pretty minor an aggressive colorful and witty man 
trying to stay deep within the woodwork 
down from manhattan for three days last week at bush 
headquarters ailes expertly deflected questions with a stream of 
disparaging remarks about his girth his skills and his importance 
all of them are considerable 
on the first some people are just built like mailboxes its 
not my fault its genes and spaghetti 
on the second my job is to help but im not an imagemaker 
you cant create something that isnt there you cant make 
somebody someone hes not 
on the third a hundred years from now you think people are 
going to have seminars on roger ailes hell no 
maybe not but ailes has already played a pivotal role in bushs 
shifting fortunes 
for one thing he primed bush for his infamous confrontation 
with cbs anchorman dan rather i happened to be hanging around 
ailes says with typical understatement once they have the rifles 
cocked you might as well fight back 
ailes also coached bush for this years gop debates and 
suggested that he call pete du pont by his given name of 
pierre a tactic that nonplussed the former delaware governor 
during a live broadcast and ailes made a tv ad that bush aides 
credit with helping the vice president defeat sen bob dole in new 
hampshire the turning point of his drive for the nomination 
im rarely ever able to get a client of mine to say one 
commercial i did saved them says dan payne who produced some of 
the ads used by democrat michael dukakis bushs likely rival 
for ailes to be able to do that says something about his 
persuasiveness in that campaign 
ailes was depicted as an enfant terrible cynical foulmouthed 
and unerring in his perceptions in joe mcginnis book the 
selling of the president 1968 
lets face it he is quoted as saying a lot of people 
think nixon is dull they look at him as the kind of kid who 
always carried a bookbag who was 42yearsold the day he was born 
they figure the other kids got footballs for christmas nixon got a 
briefcase and he loved it hed always have his homework done and 
hed never let you copy 
twenty years later ailes is as cutting as ever but not about 
bush the more you know about george bush the more you like 
him he says he has been out of the limelight for the last 
seven years but i dont see that as a problem its an 
opportunity 
newsweek labeled the vice president a gaffeomatic and 
published an embarrassing glossary of bushspeak when he uses 
plain speech he seems to be speaking something other than his 
native language says kathleen jamieson a political media 
analyst at the university of texas 
ailes responds the guy is a very articulate human being i 
dont care if he fluffs up some lines once in a while it doesnt 
matter to me 
he adds i advised him once to stop saying some word and he 
got all mad and said no i sort of respected that and shut up and 
never gave him any more advice on which words to use or not use 
in past presidential and congressional campaigns ailes has 
demonstrated an uncanny ability to make vulnerable candidates 
appear strong and appealing 
after president reagan bombed in his first debate with walter 
mondale in 1984 ailes psyched him for the second debate with a pep 
talk worthy of knute rockne garry wills wrote in his book 
reagans america by all accounts reagan redeemed himself in 
the second encounter 
this year ailes is assembling creative teams around the country 
to contribute ad ideas for bush so far he has shown bush with his 
family with reagan with foreign leaders what next 
basically youre going to see us present bushs record and 
dukakis record and let people decide if they want a liberal or a 
conservative ailes says hes determined to make america see 
bush as he sees him and convinced theyll like what they see 
if reagan is john wayne ailes says then bush is gary cooper 
quiet nice gentle he doesnt want to fight he would like to 
talk everything out but this guys got a steel core when its 
necessary

florida democrats are promoting sen bob 
graham for the vice presidential spot on the ticket although the 
prospect leaves the state party chairman scared to death 
a group of floridians headed by us rep bill grant have 
written letters to likely nominee michael dukakis and uncommitted 
delegates urging them to back graham the group also has 
distributed 500 graham for vp buttons 
were trying to create a national awareness that he is a 
viable possibility said grant who promised that a committee 
will be formed as the grahambackers expand their effort 
the committee hopes to deluge the national convention with 
banners signs and stickers 
bob graham is not only a favorite son hes a very strong 
candidate said state aflcio president dan miller he was a 
very popular southern governor and he would bring a southern 
flavor to the ticket 
but other florida democrats have mixed feelings about the effort 
by graham supporters especially charles whitehead the states 
party chairman 
if a dukakisgraham ticket were elected in november republican 
gov bob martinez would be able to appoint a candidate of his 
liking to serve as senator until a special election in 1990 
whitehead said he is scared to death when he thinks about 
graham as vice president 
the greatest thing for me as party chairman would be bob 
graham on the ticket because i believe that would ensure us of 
carrying florida whitehead said but the worst thing for me 
would be to have gov bob martinez get to appoint a senator 
graham has had nothing to do with the effort to promote him 
according to grant but his backers believe the former twoterm 
governor and firstterm senator would be enthusiastic about running 
with dukakis 
grahams washington press secretary ken klein said his boss is 
not seeking a place on the ticket 
he is not active in trying to make the phone ring klein 
said he has been flattered by the suggestion that it might 
ring

moscow may dominate politics during 
the superpower summit but leningrad can offer rich historical and 
cultural treasures plus the visiting new york philharmonic when 
nancy reagan visits the soviets second largest city tuesday 
mrs reagan apparently will miss the opening concert of the new 
york orchestras 10day soviet tour tuesday night in tchaikovsky 
hall and when zubin mehta takes his musicians to moscow on 
saturday the reagans will be gone 
but as the first lady will discover this magnificent city of 5 
million people that peter the great built on northern marshland has 
other attractions that moscow cannot boast 
leningrad first named st petersburg and then petrograd was 
the capital of the russian empire from 1703 to 1918 after the 
bolshevik revolution of 1917 the capital was moved to moscow but 
many argue that leningrad has superior architecture unique 
cultural advantages and a more cosmopolitan air 
leningrad is close to soviet hearts as the cradle of the 
revolution that brought the communists to power more than 70 years 
ago 
it also suffered the most during world war ii when 650000 
people died of starvation during a nazi blockade and more than 
17000 were killed in air raids and artillery shelling 
for many tourists the biggest draw is the hermitage museum 
which houses one of the most fabulous art collections in the world 
paintings by leonardo picasso matisse and other great artists can 
be found in the hermitage whose collection was begun in 1764 by 
catherine the great 
the main building catherines winter palace is itself a work 
of art the baroque architecture was done by bartolomeo francesco 
rastrelli an italian who designed several other leningrad 
landmarks 
many a visitor has become exhausted trying to see the 65000 
works occupying 400 rooms in the hermitage guides advise spreading 
a tour over several days 
the winter palace lies on a historic site dvortsovaya ploschad 
or palace square it was on this square in 1905 that troops of czar 
nicholas ii fired on peaceful demonstrators killing as many as 30 
people in what came to be known as bloody sunday 
soldiers chased the provisional government from the winter 
palace in the climactic event of the 1917 revolution 
the architectural center of the city is the admiralty a former 
shipyard whose tapered golden spire can be seen from many parts of 
leningrad 
another must for visitors is the bronze horseman an 
equestrian statue of peter the great who founded the city as a 
window on the west he chose the site for the commercial and 
cultural links to the west afforded by a strategic outlet to the 
baltic sea 
as it approaches the gulf of finland the neva river combines 
with other tributaries to form an intricate delta consisting of 
more than 40 islands as a result leningrad is laced with canals 
many of them bordered by the painted facades of mansions once owned 
by aristocrats the city thus earned its nickname venice of the 
north 
the main shopping and entertainment street is nevsky prospekt a 
wide avenue lined with buildings of classical architecture 
leningrad is the birthplace of modern russian literature and the 
setting for works by pushkin gogol and dostoyevsky the composer 
peter tchaikovsky worked here as did the jewelry craftsmen of 
faberge 
the kirov ballet of leningrad is the fabled rival to moscows 
bolshoi ballet 
mrs reagan will be missing one of leningrads annual treats 
because of its extreme northern latitude the sun never sets 
completely from june 11 to july 2 except for brief twilights 
the phenomenon known as white nights has been the subject of 
poems paintings songs and a movie starring ballet star mikhail 
baryshnikov who began his dancing career at the kirov

the war in afghanistan has cut that 
nations food production by onehalf and the devastated cropland 
cannot support the immediate return of millions of refugees 
according to a study released monday 
the survey said it will take at least three years and 4 billion 
to restore cropland and livestock affected by 10 years of fighting 
in afghanistan other officials have said such reconstruction could 
take 10 to 20 years 
professor azam gul an afghan citizen who directed the sixmonth 
study said the devastation had occurred mainly since soviet troops 
intervened in 1979 to back the government in its war with moslem 
guerrillas 
there was deliberate destruction of the agricultural system by 
the russians particularly along the highways gul told reporters 
at a news conference villages were systematically bombed and trees 
were destroyed around soviet bases he said 
farmers reported that the afghan army burned crops and shot 
cattle and sheep sometimes from helicopter gunships the report 
said hundreds of farmers said more than five animals a year in 
their herds were blown up by land mines according to the report 
other farmers told researchers they sold livestock to pay for 
food or transportation out of the country 
the swedishfinanced survey was conducted by a team of afghan 
researchers who returned to their home areas to question 20000 
farmers the results are designed to help aid projects and resettle 
more than 5 million refugees after soviet troops are out of 
afghanistan 
if the refugees returned en masse now the land would not 
support them that is the categorical conclusion of the survey 
said tom morrison of the britainbased agrisystems which trained 
the researchers and collated the data 
gul said agricultural production in 1986 fell to 45 percent of 
the level in 1978 the year before the soviet intervention good 
rains last spring brought production up to 53 percent of its 1978 
level he said 
the 68page report released at the news conference said food 
production improved in 1986 after the ussupplied moslem 
guerrillas received antiaircraft missiles providing a 
protective umbrella and allowing agricultural operations to 
continue during daytime 
gul said the survey was conducted only in guerrillaheld areas 
but included all 29 provinces at least two of the 68 researchers 
escaped an ambush by government troops and another was captured and 
imprisoned six who were sent to remote provinces still have not 
reported back gul said 
the researchers used questionnaires to collect details on war 
damage crop yields irrigation and use of fertilizers 
the results showed that of the farmers who fled afghanistan in 
1987 42 percent reported their cattle sheep or goats had been 
shot to death or killed by mines and 65 percent of the farmers 
said their crops were burned 
the report recommended a phased return of the refugees timed to 
the distribution of food aid and the rebuilding of the afghan 
farms most of the refugees have fled to pakistan or iran 
reconstruction will be slow said morrison its not only a 
question of money its a matter of time just for oxen to 
reproduce you need three years to produce high quality seed he 
said 
political obstacles also will delay rehabilitation said anders 
fange of the swedish committee for afghanistan which paid for the 
870000 project 
no matter what kind of government there will be it will be 
very weak said fange who is based in the refugee camps at 
peshawar pakistan 
fragmentation of authority between the government and local 
guerrilla commanders will make the distribution of aid extremely 
complicated he said 
the soviets are in the process of withdrawing their more than 
100000 soldiers from afghanistan under a unsponsored accord 
signed in april the guerrillas who began fighting the afghan 
government after a communist coup in 1978 have said they will keep 
up the war until the afghan government is defeated

greeted by rare peals of church bells president 
reagan visited a newly restored monastery monday and voiced hope 
that religious bells might be clamoring for joy in their newfound 
freedom someday throughout the soviet union 
the faith of your people has been tested and tempered in the 
crucible of hardship reagan told 18 blackgarbed russian 
orthodox monks in the walled danilov monastery on the southern edge 
of the soviet capital but in that suffering it has grown 
strong 
reagan has been cautious in his praise of increased religious 
tolerance under secretary general mikhail s gorbachev stressing 
that more freedom is needed for soviet jews as well as christians 
his visit to the oldest monastery in moscow built in the 13th 
century and once converted into a factory by the atheistic soviet 
government seemed aimed at bringing his point clearly home 
we may hope that perestroika will be accompanied by a deeper 
restructuring and that glasnost which means giving voice will 
also let loose a new chorus of belief reagan said 
the president said he hoped the soviet governments decision to 
give the monastery back to the orthodox church in 1983 signals a 
willingness to return to believers the thousands of other houses of 
worship which are now closed boarded up or used for secular 
purposes 
a pool of soviet and foreign journalists was permitted to listen 
to reagans remarks but was asked to leave when the monks responded 
although the soviet union is officially atheist unofficial 
estimates put the number of soviet religious believers at more than 
90 million 
in 1929 the state issued a series of restrictions on religious 
practice including a requirement that church members register with 
state authorities and a ban on religious education over the past 
few months the government has announced that a review of the 
restrictions is under way 
nevertheless church bells still are rarely heard in moscow but 
they rang out twice on monday once when president and mrs reagan 
arrived at the monastery and again when they left 
the monastery was closed to worshipers during the reagans 
halfhour visit several hundred soviets crowded against police 
barricades near the monastery and lined nearby sidewalks some 
waving at the americans 
inside the monastery the reagans were shown a religious icon 
which was being renovated in the cathedral of the holy fathers 
which was decorated with birch branches for the occasion 
the president then walked past a goldtopped cupola into a 
reception room where he spoke to the monks who wore gold crosses 
around their necks 
our people feel it keenly when religious freedom is denied to 
anyone anywhere and hope with you that soon all the many soviet 
religious communities that are now prevented from registering or 
are banned altogether including the ukrainian catholic and 
orthodox churches will soon be able to practice their religion 
freely and openly he said 
reagan quoted exiled soviet author alexander solzhenitsyn who 
wrote about church bells that once sounded throughout russia 
in our prayers we may keep that image in mind reagan said 
the thought that the bells may ring again someday through moscow 
and the countryside clamoring for joy in their newfound freedom 
the danilov monastery seat of the orthodox churchs 
patriarchate has been renovated in the past several years for the 
celebration next month of the 1000th anniversary of the 
establishment of christianity in ancient russia 
the reagans were accompanied by metropolitan filaret the second 
highest ranking leader in the russian orthodox church hierarchy 
the monastery was founded in 1272 by the first prince of moscow 
and served as part of the southern defenses of the city after a 
period of decline it was rebuilt by ivan the terrible in the 16th 
century 
after the bolshevik revolution of 1917 the soviet government 
took over the monastery and turned it into a factory in may 1983 
it was returned to the church

president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev neared agreement on a secondary arms accord during summit 
talks today that preceded a dramatic effort by reagan to champion 
human rights and religious freedom 
reagan visited a monastery and implored gorbachev to permit a 
new era of religious freedom quoting russias prerevolutionary 
writer alexander pushkin he said its time my friend its 
time 
but the soviets were giving no ground on the touchy human rights 
questions after reagan finished an extraordinary meeting with 
dissidents and refuseniks foreign ministry spokesman gennady 
gerasimov said they are not the best of the soviet public 
rather on the contrary 
despite the pointed differences on human rights there was no 
apparent tension at a state dinner tonight the two leaders flashed 
smiles and chatted amiably occasionally laughing as they stood 
next to each other in a guest receiving line in the chandeliered 
hall of facets at the kremlin 
toasting reagan later the soviet leader called for closer 
contacts with americans but gorbachev said this should be done 
without interfering in domestic affairs without sermonizing or 
imposing ones views and ways without turning family or personal 
problems into a pretext for confrontation between states 
reagan said the two leaders had continued searching at their 
fourth summit for common ground in the ussoviet 
relationship and he would advise his successor next january that 
it is a search that must be continued 
also he said it is a search that can succeed 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the formal summit 
session focused on arms control there were signs the two sides 
were coming together on an armstest notification procedure he 
said the accords had seemed sidetracked just last week but 
gerasimov said i believe that tomorrow we will have a draft 
treaty on the launching of ballistic missiles 
gerasimov called the session businesslike and said 
gorbachev still hopes to come to agreement with reagan on a far 
more important treaty to reduce strategic arms arsenals arms 
control working groups continued to meet 
to the several dozen dissidents and refuseniks and members of 
their families arrayed before him at the us embassy guesthouse 
the president said i came here hoping to do what i could to give 
you strength 
but i already know it is you who have strengthened me you 
have given me a message to carry back while we press for human 
rights through diplomatic channels you press with your very lives 
day in day out year after year risking your jobs your homes 
your all 
he said the united states views human rights as fundamental 
absolutely fundamental to our relations with the soviet union and 
all nations 
reagan said it was a hopeful time for the soviets with the 
release of political and religious prisoners and an increase in the 
number of people allowed to emigrate evenso he said the kremlin 
does not meet the standards spelled out by the 1975 helsinki 
agreement on human rights 
reagan was applauded warmly by the audience but likely 
inflammed soviet sensitivity on the subject before his arrival 
here gorbachev and other soviet leaders said they didnt want to 
be lectured on human rights 
reagan also expressed hopes for religious freedom in the soviet 
union pointing out that thousands of homes of worship are now 
closed boarded up or used for secular purposes 
the second day of summitry also was marked by a new air of 
optimism that agreement could be reached on two secondary 
armscontrol pacts that had been stalled 
explaining the progress gerasimov said a compromise now seemed 
possible in counting cruise missiles carried on warplanes and on 
placing mobile missiles in defined regions in order to keep track 
of them 
these are two of the verification problems blocking a new treaty 
to reduce strategic nuclear weapons 
but the soviet official said the united states was preventing a 
resolution of the problem of monitoring cruise missiles on 
submarines he said the soviets had proposed a test in which two 
ships one carrying cruises and the other none of the weapons 
would be monitored 
he said the proposal had been turned down as an intrusion and 
probably because the united states has an edge in sealaunched 
cruise missiles gerasimov said that was an illusion and only 
temporary 
fitzwater and gerasimov said the two leaders also reviewed their 
differences on the us star wars missile defense program but that 
neither side altered its views there was no changing of minds 
more an exchange of views the us spokesman said 
reagan attended a morning meeting with gorbachev and then paid a 
visit to to moscows oldest monastery where he was greeted by 
bearded monks and the pealing of church bells 
later he held an extraordinary meeting at the us ambassadors 
residence with soviet refuseniks and dissidents one speaker gleb 
yakunin a russian orthodox priest lost his parish 22 years ago 
and was sentenced to a labor camp 
he said the contraints on religions resulted in a decline of 
morals growth of alcoholism and drug addiction and stagnation of 
the economy and said that gorbachevs program of perestroika or 
restructuring is unthinkable without true freedom of religion 
reagans second day in moscow began with a meeting with 
gorbachev in st catherines hall behind the brick walls of the 
kremlin enclave 
about 30 seconds after a clock chimed 10 am the gold doors at 
opposite ends of the room were opened and from the left in walked 
gorbachev leading the soviet delegation while from the right the 
president led the us participants 
they met at the center of the table and shook hands then shook 
hands with each member of the other delegation 
the soviet leader was asked by reporters if he would act on the 
14 human rights cases included on a list presented by reagan on 
sunday there are too many lists gorbachev replied 
commenting on soviet willingness to allow his meeting with 
dissidents and refuseniks reagan said they did that for me so 
that id feel at home 
he added every once in a while i am meeting some rather 
disagreeable people at home a reporter asked if he was saying 
dissidents are disagreeable people with a pained look on his face 
reagan said i dont mean that you know what i mean 
inside the monastary reagan accompanied by his wife nancy 
told the monks that he and other americans prayed that perestroika 
would bring a reawakening of religious freedom to the soviet union

attorney general edwin meese iii has seen his 
credibility come into question several times in the past two months 
as he struggles with growing calls for his departure 
during his most tumultuous two months in office meese has made 
comments he quickly had to clarify has been contradicted by a 
conservative republican senator who should be a natural ally and 
has been contradicted by a man he wanted to appoint to a high 
justice department position 
the attorney generals problems began more than a year ago when 
his longtime friend e robert wallach came under criminal 
investigation in the wedtech scandal 
at the behest of wallach now under indictment as a result of 
the investigation meese got involved as white house counselor with 
the south bronx ny defense contractor wedtech corp and later 
as attorney general with a 1 billion iraqi oil pipeline project 
his wedtech involvement triggered a criminal probe that began 
may 11 1987 and is expected to result several weeks from now in a 
report raising questions about meeses ethical conduct 
the protest resignations of two of meeses top aides two months 
ago caused an outburst of calls for his departure the two arnold 
burns and william weld quit out of concern that meeses continued 
tenure was hurting the justice department 
the calls increased this month when meese fired his chief 
spokesman conservative terry eastland 
asked why he fired eastland the attorney general emphatically 
rejected the notion that meese felt his chief spokesman had 
inadequately defended him 
this has nothing to do with a defense of me said meese 
but at the may 14 meeting where eastland was relieved of his 
duties meese criticized eastlands performance in defending 
meeses planned trip to japan under the auspices of a nonprofit 
group with a profitmaking arm that makes the travel arrangements 
according to department sources familiar with the conversation 
meese said he thought eastland looked unprepared at a news 
conference where eastland defended the travel arrangement 
according to the sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
meese also criticized as inadequate eastlands response in a 
newspaper article to the new jersey governors call for the 
attorney general to resign said the sources 
in response to a question about whether the attorney general 
felt he was still effective eastland was quoted in the newspaper 
article as saying that meese obviously believes he is fully 
effective in his job and that the attorney general had indicated 
on several occasions he doesnt intend to resign meese thought 
eastland should have made the assertion himself that meese was 
fully effective and wouldnt resign rather than attributing those 
conclusions to the attorney general according to the sources 
on march 31 two days after the public uproar began over the 
protest resignations of burns and weld meese was asked at a news 
conference if he would meet that day with conservative sen strom 
thurmond meese said he didnt have a meeting later in the day with 
thurmond and that he had already met with a number of people 
meese neglected to mention that he had just completed a meeting 
with thurmond minutes before meese subsequently authorized a 
written clarification after thurmond issued a statement saying a 
meeting that day with meese had focused on congressional concern 
over problems at the justice department 
in april when a reporter asked meese whether wallach had 
recommended st louis attorney john shepherd for a justice 
department job meese said no 
but it turned out that wallach did recommend shepherd to meese 
for a justice department job in 1985 a fact which meese 
acknowledged after further inquiries later the same day asked why 
he had denied it earlier meese told his spokesman he thought the 
reporter was referring to whether wallach had made such a 
recommendation recently 
on april 5 meese announced that he was recommending shepherd to 
the white house to become deputy attorney general the post vacated 
by the burns resignation 
the same day shepherd who later withdrew his name from 
consideration said we all see the legal troubles confronting 
the attorney general and that meese saw the legal problems too 
asked about shepherds comments meese said he thought they 
referred to legal problems generally in the department not his 
own shepherd later confided to department aides what was obvious 
to everyone in the room that he had been referring to meeses own 
legal problems

presidency lasted 20 years and im sure that he helped lots of

cardinal john oconnor has received some 
criticism for his plan to visit the soviet union next week to help 
celebrate the millennium of christianity there but he says passing 
up the trip would have been irrational 
some ukrainian catholics in this country have criticized the 
trip to be led by cardinal agostino casaroli the papal secretary 
of state because they say the church in the soviet union is 
subject to persecution 
but oconnor said sunday that it would be grossly irrational 
to ignore the possibility of reaching an accord who knows what is 
happening in the soviet union today 
he said he will arrive in moscow with the vatican delegation on 
june 8 to commemorate the 1000th anniversary of the establishment 
of christianity in russia

soviet spokesmen criticized president reagans 
meeting with dissidents and jewish refuseniks monday as hardly 
aimed at improving understanding and said his summit campaign on 
human rights threatened to sabotage arms control talks 
the communist party newspaper pravda told its readers that 
although the united states is full of scientific and technological 
marvels it also is a land of homelessness hunger and repression 
of minorities 
on a day when news of the reagangorbachev summit dominated its 
pages pravda printed a photograph of shabbily clothed blacks 
lining up for a free thanksgiving meal in lafayette park across the 
street from the white house 
at the bottom of the same page it printed a story about leonard 
peltier an american indian convicted of killing two fbi agents on 
south dakotas pine ridge reservation in 1975 soviet officials 
have cited peltiers case as an example of us human rights 
violations 
countering reagans support for greater respect for human rights 
in the soviet union the official news agency tass said in a 
commentary that the soviets are seriously concerned about human 
rights in the united states 
tass quoted deputy foreign minister vladimir petrovsky as saying 
that reagans meeting with political dissidents and refuseniks at 
the us ambassadors residence is hardly aimed at improving 
understanding between the soviet union and the united states 
petrovsky had said earlier than although reagan was free to meet 
with any soviet citizens the spaso house session was different 
because of an obviously tendentious selection of participants 
reagan told several dozen political dissidents and refuseniks 
soviet jews who have been denied permission to emigrate that 
soviet leaders are beginning to realize that economic growth 
depends largely on granting individual freedoms we must work for 
more always more he said 
the president planned to meet with soviet writers artists and 
university students on tuesday 
referring to the dissidents whom reagan met monday foreign 
ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said they are not the best 
of the soviet public rather on the contrary 
asked whether meeting with reagan would result in harm to the 
dissidents gerasimov replied i met mr reagan today but i 
dont think i am going to be harmed in any way by just meeting 
him 
he brushed off further questions about whether refuseniks who 
met with reagan had jeopardized their chances of leaving the soviet 
union 
other soviet commentators disputed reagans charges of soviet 
human rights abuses and warned him against derailing superpower 
negotiations on arms control and other issues 
one cannot put up with the human rights theme being exploited 
to foment enmity in statetostate relations and sabotage the 
processes of disarmament and detente wrote tass commentator 
sergei staroselsky 
the soviet side is seriously concerned about the 
discrimination of national minorities prosecution for political 
reasons and death sentences passed on minors in the united 
states he wrote 
yelena lukasheva a prominent soviet legal scholar accused 
western human rights organizations such as helsinki watch of 
inflating the number of soviet political prisoners which she said 
totaled 13 
the people you call political prisoners are simple 
criminals she told reporters she said none was sentenced for 
political actions or views 
american lawyer karen parker and indian rights activist anthony 
gonzales both of san francisco were among four us human rights 
activists who held a news conference at the soviet peace committee 
on monday 
ms parker said they had come to moscow at their own expense to 
present a balanced view by publicizing alleged us human 
rights abuses against racial minorities the homeless the hungry 
the disabled and refugees who have been returned forcibly to their 
homelands

a protest within sight of the kremlin on monday 
produced passionate debate on mikhail s gorbachevs reforms by 
bystanders and several dozen jews seeking to emigrate 
in a gathering that police had difficulty controlling at least 
100 people stopped along kalinin prospekt a major avenue leading 
to the kremlin to watch the refusenik protest and to argue their 
views about gorbachevs effort to rebuild soviet society 
despite constant appeals by police using bullhorns to stop 
blocking the walkway next to the lenin library the refuseniks and 
onlookers argued in small groups under a hot late afternoon sun 
dozens of others pressed around to hear oblivious to the police 
there was no violence and the demonstrators who were among 
those not invited to a meeting with president reagan at the us 
ambassadors residence left after about an hour 
this is a country that its impossible to leave like a 
prison said 50yearold moscow resident aaron greenberg 
responding to an elderly man who said the united states observed 
human rights no better than the soviet union 
greenberg said he has been waiting five years for permission to 
emigrate but that officials claim he had access to state secrets 
in a postal job he held 25 years ago 
another bystander who identified himself as georgy gusev held up 
a piece of white paper on which he had drawn a star of david and a 
swastika zionism is fascism he said citing israeli 
occupation of arab territory 
but pressed by angry refuseniks he said he thought that anyone 
who wanted to leave the soviet union should be free to do so 
other bystanders shouted that the protest was hurting gorbachev 
during his meetings with reagan 
one woman who stopped by blamed the refuseniks problems on 
bureaucrats whom gorbachev has been unable to clean out of the 
soviet system 
the bureaucrats all stay in place and while they are in place 
on top there wont be perestroika below said zoya urisheva if 
everything was in order we wouldnt have a refusal problem 
vladimir meshkov a moscow jew who said he has been refused 
permission to leave for seven years shouted let us go to 
israel a halfdozen times as the demonstration ended and police 
began escorting the last of the protesters to a nearby train 
entrance 
meshkov his wife lida and three and his family held signs 
during the protest claiming refusal is a form of murder he 
said he had been beaten severely twice this year during 
demonstrations they are really trying to kill us he said 
yuri semyonovsky who said he has been refused permission to 
emigrate for two years said said of the meetings between reagan 
and gorbachev we expect there will be progress but we dont know 
how deep it will be 
one of the protesters added i expect maybe mr reagan will 
challenge mr gorbachevs idea of democracy as a leader of a 
really democratic country 
others held banners calling for a world without missiles or 
refusals asking the united states for asylum and proclaiming 
themselves prisoners of the kgb secret police and the soviet visa 
office 
avi weiss head of the student struggle for soviet jewry and the 
national center for russian jewry of new york stopped to talk to 
the protesters after he and five others conducted a protest for 18 
minutes on red square earlier in the afternoon 
he said the group insisted gorbachev free all our people 
and demanded that the united states make trade with the soviet 
union depended on the soviet human rights policy 
the demonstration broke up without incident he said

george bush said monday that edwin 
meese iii the embattled attorney general promised in a recent 
private meeting not to do anything to jeopardize bushs campaign 
for the presidency 
the vice president speaking with reporters after participating 
in a rainy memorial day ceremony at his oceanside vacation retreat 
confirmed that he talked with meese but declined to elaborate on 
the meeting 
now that that secret is no longer a secret i prefer to let 
him discuss that bush the certain republican nominee said of 
the meeting 
bush aides had been refusing even to confirm the meeting which 
the washington post reported in saturdays editions 
he and i agreed we werent going to discuss that bush said 
but asked if meese had promised not to do anything to hurt his 
presidential campaign bush said yes yes i think its fair to 
say that 
the vice president has not called for meeses resignation and 
has said he does not want to comment on the matter until after the 
independent counsels report on meeses legal difficulties is 
issued bush said he expected that report to be released shortly 
campaign aides have said that meese has become a political 
liability making it hard for the vice president to argue his case 
for returning high ethical standards to government 
white house chief of staff howard baker said sunday that 
president reagan believes that meeses legal problems could harm 
bushs political fortunes 
oh i think so for the moment and to some degree but i 
think that he reagan too would urge you to wait and see how all 
this unfolds and develops baker said on nbctvs meet the 
press program 
as in years past bush delivered a short speech in the town 
square at the conclusion of kennebunkports memorial day parade 
bush noting the ussoviet summit in moscow said the arms 
control agreement to eliminate intermediaterange weapons would not 
have been reached if the united states had not been strong if we 
hadnt sacrificed from time to time as a nation 
we got there because the soviet union saw us as strong he 
said 
bush said that if elected he would try to follow reagans lead 
and reach additional arms control agreements with the soviets 
including pacts on biological and chemical warfare 
in his 10minute talk bush twice referred to the holiday as 
veterans day 
his wife barbara laid a wreath at a town monument 
commemorating the war dead 
several thousand people crowded the streets of downtown 
kennebunkport to watch the parade which consisted of two bands boy 
scout and brownie troops town dignitaries and a halfdozen fire 
engines 
bush is spending the week meeting with advisers and republican 
leaders in hopes of energizing his lagging presidential campaign 
on tuesday he planned to meet with economic advisers including 
martin feldstein former chairman of the white house council of 
economic advisers former assistant treasury secretary richard 
darman and kathleen eickhoff formerly chief economist for the

a 5 million lawsuit against a congressional candidate whos 
opposing erhards brother in a republican primary next month 
erhard is the founder of the est program his brother nathan 
rosenberg is among those opposing christopher cox in the primary 
for the 40th congressional district seat 
the suit claims that criticism of est training by cox was 
libelous and slanderous 
the lawsuit focuses on statements about est contained in 110000 
brochures mailed to orange county residents this month and alleged 
telephone calls by coxs campaign workers asking voters whether 
they would support a candidate if he were linked to a cult 
organization 
the lawsuit filed friday in orange county superior court is 
baseless and groundless said bob schuman coxs campaign 
manager 
the brochure quoted a los angeles magazine article as saying 
that the chicagobased cult awareness network has called est and 
other erhard programs destructive cults 
coxs mailer is similar to one used in 1986 by the districts 
incumbent rep robert badham badham apologized and retracted his 
statements in 1986 after werner erhard and associates threatened a 
lawsuit

the adoptive parents of 2yearold 
indian twins are optimistic the us supreme court will uphold 
their custody despite an appeal by the childrens choctaw tribe 
tribal rulers claim they have jurisdiction because the twins 
lived on the reservation while fetuses despite a lower court 
ruling that upheld the adoption since the children were born in 
nearby gulfport 
the choctaws have not seen the last of us curtiss holyfield 
said in a recent interview well do what we have to do 
holyfields age 62 also has been an issue in the adoption 
the us supreme court decided last week it will rule on the 
legality of the jan 28 1986 adoption of samuel seth and megan 
beth born out of wedlock to jennie bell then 24 the mother had 
lived on the choctaw reservation near philadelphia in central 
mississippi 
the mississippi band of choctaw indians sued the holyfields 
saying the adoption finalized in harrison county chancery court 
violated the tribes sovereignty over its legal affairs 
but the mississippi supreme court ruled aug 5 1987 that the 
tribe had no jurisdiction in part because the twins were born in 
gulfport and never resided on the reservation 
the case has raised several legal issues including the creative 
argument by choctaw lawyers that the twins resided on the 
reservation while inside the mothers womb 
its like if a us citizen went to germany and had her child 
there choctaw chief phillip martin said 
in that situation he said the us government would have 
authority over the welfare of the child 
the holyfield adoption is particularly unusual because the long 
beach couple had been rejected by adoption agencies because of 
curtiss holyfields age now 62 the retired school principal and 
methodist minister would be in his late 70s when the twins graduate 
from high school 
thats the point we dont know anything about the adoption 
we dont know what the deal was we dont know anything about 
the past history of the holyfields martin said 
he said if the tribal court could determine the fate of the 
children hollyfields age would certainly be a factor 
age doesnt bother me curtiss holyfield said the 
important thing is we love children how could you be a teacher or 
even a minister if you didnt like being around children 
vivian holyfield 47 a firstgrade teacher at waveland 
elementary school sums up the rejection by adoption agencies in 
one word discrimination 
while the issue is now a heated legal battle the initial 
adoption agreement say the holyfields was a friendly effort 
between them and bell to solve a mutual dilemma in 1985 bell 
already the unmarried mother of two children became pregnant and 
believed she couldnt afford another child she rejected the idea 
of an abortion and couldnt find adoptive parents in the 
philadelphia area vivian holyfield said 
bell could not be reached for comment this week 
with vivian unable to become pregnant the holyfields were 
stymied in their dream of a family the holyfields say bell 
telephoned them on dec 3 to ask if they would be her childrens 
parents 
i remember the date because it was my birthday vivian 
holyfield said i feel the lord wanted us to have these 
children 
the holyfields had known bell several years going back to when 
she attended the united methodist church where curtiss holyfield 
was pastor 
seth and beth were born dec 29 two months premature the 
holyfields paid all medical bills 12000 for intensivecare 
treatment of the twins and about 3500 for bell 
curtiss holyfield had six children in a previous marriage that 
ended in divorce seth and beth who were 2 years and 5 months old 
sunday are the aunt and uncle of nine grandchildren the 
youngest of which is seven he said

robert schornstheimer who safely landed 
his aloha airlines jet last month after a section of the cabin blew 
away in flight says his lifelong curiosity about machinery helped 
him land the plane 
as a child schornstheimer said he always wanted to know what 
made things work 
in some ways ive prepared all my life in that sense for 
that situation schornstheimer said referring to the april 28 
accident in which the aloha jet lost a portion of its fuselage 
one person a flight attendant aboard the jet was killed when 
she was sucked out of the plane 
one of the impressions i had was that everything was so 
normal and a fraction of a second later everything seemed slightly 
unreal he said 
after he heard the section of the cabin blow away he said he 
looked out the door of the cockpit and saw blue sky 
that was a really disturbing impression we were really 
stunned for a second the pilot said from his home in hawaii in 
an interview published last week in the marietta times 
schornstheimer a former air force pilot graduated in 1963 from 
marietta high school and later from defiance college in ohio 
schornstheimer said he slowed the plane to about 200 mph and 
adjusted its wing flaps for a controlled descent he said the plane 
shook as if it were experiencing turbulence when he tried to slow 
it more 
somewhere right in that area it went through my mind that we 
wouldnt make it schornstheimer said 
however 13 minutes after the accident he landed the plane 
safely 
schornstheimer returned to his job on may 20

the oldest person in town is being returned to its home by a 
california antique collector who was about to have the gold head of 
the handcrafted piece melted down 
officials in this central maine town are awaiting the return of 
the boston post cane from the unidentified antique buff who 
purchased the ebony staff from a dealer in california 
the monterey man got in touch with the town office about three 
weeks ago said town manager mike roy 
the collector told roy he noticed the vassalboro town name 
etched in the head and was curious about the historical 
significance of the walking stick when he found out its history 
he offered to sell it back to the town for the same undisclosed 
price he paid for it 
the cane was one of more than 600 handcrafted canes distributed 
in 1909 by the boston post to towns and cities in maine 
massachusetts new hampshire and rhode island accompanying the 
cane was a letter from publisher edwin a grozier that said the 
canes should always be owned and carried by the oldest citizen of 
your town 
town officials were to act as trustees for the canes as they 
were passed down through the years the canes were made from 
sevenfoot logs of ebony shipped from africa cutting finishing 
and polishing them took about a year 
no one seemed to know when the post cane had left vassalboro 
when it returns it will be checked for its authenticity and 
presented to the local historical society

president mohammad zia ulhaq on 
monday accused the ousted prime minister and his government of 
incompetence and corruption and said he fired them because they 
failed to reduce crime or improve the economy 
former prime minister mohammad khan junejo charged that the 
president violated democratic principles by dissolving the 
government without consulting him and he vowed to rebound in 
elections for the new government 
zia fired junejo junejos 33member cabinet and the 210seat 
national assembly on sunday and said elections would be held within 
90 days 
the government which ruled the country for more than three 
years was ineffective zia 64 said in a nationally televised 
speech monday zia charged that junejo had to bribe his supporters 
and lawmakers with favors that led to unprecedented corruption at 
all levels 
the outgoing government relied too heavily on domestic and 
foreign borrowing that deepened the nations economic crisis zia 
added 
he strongly criticized the junejo government for failing to 
control crime especially in pakistans largest city of karachi 
and for failing to prevent ethnic regional and class conflicts and 
rioting 
the law and order situation is so bad that people spend 
sleepless nights because of the fear of getting robbed kidnapped 
or murdered he said 
ethnic riots in southern sind province and the port city of 
karachi have killed hundreds since zia lifted martial law in 1985 
and handed limited power over to junejos pakistan muslim league 
government 
speaking at a news conference junejo said the dissolution of 
the national assembly by the president was taken arbitrarily and 
solely on his own the action is against the fundamentals of 
democratic process 
junejo vowed that his muslim league will win control of the 
assembly on the basis of our record of democracy and public 
service 
the national assembly and junejos cabinet were scheduled to 
remain in office until 1990 they were elected in december 1984 
junejo was appointed prime minister in march 1985 
junejos was the first civilian cabinet since zia the army 
chief of staff ended eight years of martial law 
zia set no date for the new elections but he announced a major 
policy change saying political parties will be allowed to propose 
their own candidates for assembly seats 
in the 1984 elections parties were not permitted to field their 
own candidates the balloting was boycotted by the opposition 
the president said he will soon appoint a caretaker cabinet to 
help run the country until a new government is elected 
benazir bhutto leader of the opposition pakistan peoples 
party was quoted in the englishlanguage newspaper the muslim as 
saying she welcomes zias move but still has doubts we will wait 
until the rules of the game are spelled out she said 
her father zulfikar ali bhutto was a prime minister toppled by 
zia in a military coup in 1977 he was hanged in 1979 on a murder 
conspiracy conviction 
zias 25minute speech was largely confined to domestic policy 
issues but he also discussed pakistans relations with the united 
states and soviet union 
our present relations with the united states china and the 
islamic countries are the cornerstone of our foreign policy and we 
will continue this policy he said 
he said pakistans relations with the soviet union will improve 
despite nine years of tensions arising from pakistans support of 
afghan guerrillas fighting the red army and the sovietbacked kabul 
government 
zia said relations with india pakistans eastern neighbor will 
be normalized and tensions resulting from three wars in 40 years 
will be reduced

president mohammad zia ulhaqs 
dismissal of his government came against a backdrop of increased 
ethnic riots terrorist bombings and a chamber of quarreling 
lawmakers 
on sunday zia shocked the nation when he dissolved the national 
assembly and fired prime minister mohammad khan junejo and his 
33member cabinet zia accused them of failing to maintain law and 
order and allowing public morality to slide 
zia an army general who took power in a bloodless coup 11 years 
ago appointed junejo prime minister in march 1985 following the 
december 1984 national elections 
zia and junejo were faced with an upsurge in ethnic violence 
especially in the melting pot of karachi a sprawling port city on 
the indian ocean 
the main combatants are the mohajirs moslems who migrated from 
india after partition in 1947 and pathans tribes who came from 
northern pakistan 
sharing the cramped squalid cinderblock slums as little as a 
traffic accident can spark days of gunfights and killing between 
the groups 
hundreds died in such riots in november and december 1986 
violence still flares every few weeks 
the southern province of sind also has seen an upsurge in 
robbery murder and kidnapping 
government officials say the war in neighboring afghanistan has 
spilled into pakistan in the form of increased traffic in illicit 
drugs and weapons along with more than 2 million war refugees 
they claim that pakistan was a virtual stranger to drug abuse 
five years ago officials now estimate there are as many as 15 
million heroin addicts 
pakistan has paid a heavy price for its support of afghan 
guerrillas fighting to topple the sovietbacked kabul government 
hundreds of people were killed in terrorist bombings in pakistan 
in 1986 and 1987 police blamed the attacks on afghan government 
agents 
the worst warrelated disaster occurred april 10 when a huge 
ammunition depot filled with ussupplied weapons for the afghan 
rebels exploded 
tens of thousands of rockets grenades and artillery shells 
rained over the neighboring cities of islamabad and rawalpindi 
official reports put the casualty toll at 105 dead and 1500 
wounded but others claim hundreds of people are still unaccounted 
for 
zia first called it an extraordinary accident but later 
hinted it was sabotage results of a government probe of the 
disaster have not been made public 
while appealing for national unity and moslem values 
legislation to that effect made slow progress through the 217seat 
national assembly 
though dominated by the ruling muslim league the assembly also 
contained some independents and members of small opposition parties 
filibusters were common when there was a quorum some debates 
had to be canceled because of low attendance 
average pakistanis seem also to drag their feet on the 
islamization issue although alcohol consumption is punishable by 
flogging bootleg liquor is a booming industry 
nonmoslem foreigners are exempted from the law

president reagan told nearly 100 emotionally 
charged soviet refuseniks and political dissidents monday that he 
is pressing soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev for human rights 
improvements because hopes are rising that freedom will truly 
come to all 
it is our belief that this is a moment of hope he said 
the new soviet leaders appear to grasp the connection between 
certain freedoms and economic growth the freedom to keep the 
fruits of ones own labor for example is a freedom that the 
present reforms seem to be enlarging 
reagan told wouldbe emigrees persecuted religious believers 
and human rights activists that he hopes economic freedom will lead 
to other freedoms of religion speech and travel 
there can be no relenting for now we must work for more 
always more he declared 
i have to believe that freedom will truly come to all for 
what injustice can withstand your strength and what can conquer 
your prayers reagan told the tense excited tense crowd at spaso 
house the residence of the us ambassador 
reagan was interrupted by repeated ovations and some in the 
crowd were close to tears 
the presidents meeting which prompted criticism by soviet 
officials and press commentators followed his visit to the 
restored 13th century danilov monastery on the southern edge of 
moscow there he told a small band of russian orthodox monks of his 
hope that current soviet reforms will yield greater religious 
freedom 
reagans meetings with christian monks and jewish refuseniks 
who have been denied permission to emigrate were unprecedented for 
a visiting american president soviet authorities seemed less than 
enthralled 
approaches to spaso house were sealed off by heavy police 
cordons at the us embassy where the presidents guests 
assembled before the meeting they had to show identity documents 
and have their names checked off a list to get through police lines 
two leningrad refuseniks roald alec zelenichok and yevgeny 
lein said they were warned by kgb agents last week not to attend 
the meeting they came to moscow anyway and entered spaso house 
without problems 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov asked 
what he thought of reagans meeting noted that the presidents 
guests were not the flower of our society but they praised 
reagan for meeting them directly to discuss human rights 
im an old fan of his as are many of the refuseniks so it 
was very nice to see him in person and to see his personal deep 
concern said sergei petrov who sat next to nancy reagan at the 
meeting petrov has been refused permission to join his american 
wife for nine years 
reagan sat next to abe stolar a 73yearold american who came 
to the soviet union as a child in the 1930s and has battled since 
1975 to leave the country with his family 
on the american side ive seen everybody up to the 
president about my problems petrov said on the soviet side 
the highest authority ive been able to speak with is a junior 
clerk 
refusenik tanya zieman said she was overwhelmed by the 
meeting 
we are not so used to hearing such human words without any 
political statement said her husband yuri 
andrei sakharov 67 who once was the soviet unions most 
prominent human rights activist was not invited to the meeting a 
us official said he would be attending a state dinner at spaso 
house on tuesday 
sakharov has been restrained in his contact with westerners 
since he returned from internal exile in gorky in december 1986 he 
has spoken out in support of gorbachevs reforms but also makes 
demands for freedom for political prisoners that do not accord with 
communist party orthodoxy 
while many guests at spaso house were enthusiastic about their 
meeting with reagan two of the political dissidents were more 
restrained in their assessment 
yuli kosharovsky who has been denied an exist visa for 17 
years hesitantly replied i hope so when asked whether the 
meeting with reagan would help him and others who attended 
the other was sergei kovalev a sociologist who lost his job for 
protesting the 1968 warsaw pact invasion of czechoslovakia and 
spent 10 years of internal exile in a labor camp the fact of 
this meeting was more important than anything that was said 
kovalev said 
the third speaker orthodox priest gleb yakunin credited reagan 
with playing an important personal role in gaining the release of 
many of the spaso house guests from detention last year 
many prisoners of conscience are still languishing in prisons 
labor camps exile and in psychiatric hospitals he said some 
are still imprisoned for religious activities we trust that you 
mr president will do everything in your power to facilitate a 
speedy release

police said monday they were 
investigating the cause of a melee in which a woman was fatally 
shot and two men were stabbed after a memorial day weekend concert 
and cookoff 
the fracas apparently started among a group of motorists upset 
over congested traffic following the sunday evening event at the 
pasadena fairgrounds authorities said 
two men were involved in a fight over the snarling traffic in 
which three rounds of gunfire were shot a stray bullet struck 
sherry ann longoria 24 in the upper torso as she sat in the 
drivers seat of her car police said the other two bullets struck 
another vehicle 
ms longorias husband richard savales his brother james 
savales and a friend then approached the two men police said 
during the ensuing struggle javier torres 17 and joseph angel 
torres 26 were stabbed james savales also suffered a minor cut 
on his hand police said 
ms longoria javier torres and joseph torres were transported 
by life flight helicopter to hermann hospital in houston 
ms longoria died sunday night while undergoing surgery 
hospital administrative manager theresa kowpak said the two men 
were in serious but stable condition in the intensive care unit 
she said 
eleven people were arrested in connection with the fight eight 
of them for public intoxication and the others for criminal 
mischief said betty parks spokeswoman for the pasadena police 
department 
ms parks said the fight erupted near the entrance of the 
pasadena civic center on the fairgrounds 
at this time it appears that it all started when these people 
lost their tempers ms parks said there was a car that went 
off into a ditch and tempers flared and somebody pulled out a gun 
i understand there was alcohol served at the cookoff so its 
possible that people had been drinking and were in a hurry to 
leave ms parks said 
she did not know how many people had attended the event 
gibson said police are still talking to about 20 witnesses 
police were unsure how many people were involved in the 
incident but said some brandished tire tools and twobyfours

ernst ruska the west german professor who shared 
the 1986 nobel prize in physics for developing the electron 
microscope has died in west berlin officials of his university 
said monday he was 81 
ruska died friday after a short illness west berlins technical 
university said it gave no other details 
ruska shared the 1986 nobel prize with west german scientist 
gerd binnig and heinrich rohrer of switzerland 
he was awarded for developing the electron microscope in 1931 
the electron microscope is much more powerful than an optical 
microscope it can magnify the most minute objects by 10000 times 
ruska discovered that electron radiation can reflect like the 
light in a lense ruskas lense was a magnet that uncoupled the 
charged elements from their course the first commercial electron 
microscope went on the market in 1939 and rusla continued to 
improve the instrument 
in an interview with the associated press after winning the 
prize ruska said he was surprised that the distinction came so 
long after his discovery 
the electron microscope was first built in 1931 thats 55 
years ago i could have perhaps expected this award 40 years ago

senate majority leader robert byrd headed to 
moscow monday to urge soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev to permit 
the printing of up to 100 million bibles and enhance the spirit 
of liberty in the soviet union 
byrd and senate republican leader bob dole were invited by 
president reagan to attend wednesdays summit ceremony featuring 
the exchange of the ratified intermediaterange nuclear forces 
treaty documents the senate approved the treaty by a 935 vote 
friday and the soviet presidium ratified it 17 hours later 
byrd dwva told a news conference before boarding an air 
force boeing 707 from the presidential fleet that reagans 
invitation underlines the nature of the american system a system 
which has the separation of powers and a system in which both the 
executive and the us senate work together in the making of 
treaties 
byrd said that when he sees gorbachev he will urge the soviet 
leader to expand on a promise to allow the printing of 100000 
bibles in the russianspeaking areas of the soviet union 
onehundred thousand bibles wont go very for in a country of 
280 million people byrd said 
the importance that i ascribe to this as the apostle paul 
said where there is the spirit of the lord there is liberty 
said byrd so i would think that if we could get mr gorbachev to 
enlarge upon this publication of bibles this would enhance the 
spirit of liberty throughout the soviet union and where that kind 
of liberty is there has to be human rights 
asked how many bibles he would like to see printed in the soviet 
union byrd declared if there can be 100 million in the soviet 
union they would be worth more than 100 mxs in this country 
he was referring to the mx missile the most powerful 
longrange rocket in the us arsenal 
byrd said his and doles presence in moscow will remind the 
leaders that the senate is looking over their shoulders as the 
superpowers work on new arms control treaties 
with the signing of the inf pact the united states and the 
soviet union are now negotiating to reduce longrange nuclear 
arsenals by up to 50 percent 
we would hope that mr gorbachev and the soviets as well as 
our own american president will understand that any new treaty 
will undergo a very thorough painstaking careful examination 
before the senate would give its approval said byrd 
dole rkan thanked reagan for inviting them to moscow 
i think our trip certainly should be a signal to people in 
this country and the soviet union that the us senate is a partner 
in the treatymaking process said dole we do play an 
important role

alfredo volpi an abstract painter who 
was widely acclaimed in brazil but never achieved the world fame 
that many said he deserved died of a heart attack a hospital said 
monday he was 92 
the sao paulo heart disease emergency center where volpi was 
taken after feeling chest pains said he died on sunday and was 
buried the same day 
volpi best known for his intricate geometrical forms in varying 
tones of red orange green blue and yellow left behind about 
3000 works of art that spanned a career of 70 years 
art critic olivio tavares de araujo one of the countrys top 
volpi experts said international fame eluded the artist because 
most of his works are in private brazilian collections and not 
available for public exhibition 
araujo said volpi created his own artistic movement and could be 
considered in the same league as picasso the critic added 
there is no doubt in my mind that in terms of artistic importance 
and of overall contribution to the world of art volpi is brazils 
answer to picasso 
born in lucca italy in 1896 volpi was two years old when his 
parents immigrated to sao paulo south americas largest city 
for years he earned a living and developed his artistic talents 
by painting flowery decorations on the inner walls of houses in sao 
paulo 
little by little he started painting on canvas first 
representational landscapes seascapes portraits and still lifes 
gradually he moved to abstract art exploring shapes color and 
light 
it wasnt until the 1960s that he started creating the 
geometrical patterns that made him famous

at least three people including a 
child died and 26 were injured monday in an explosion at a hindu 
temple in the northern city of amritsar city police chief suresh 
arora said 
we are still investigating the cause of the blast but it was 
a big one arora said 
also monday the united news of india news agency said sikh 
radicals shot and killed seven people in punjab state where 
militants among the majority sikh population have been fighting to 
establish a separate homeland amritsar is the state capital 260 
miles north of new delhi 
meanwhile the governing body of the sikh religion fired all 
five high priests on monday and accused them of betraying the 
faith news reports said 
indian security forces lay siege to the golden temple sikhisms 
holiest shrine beginning may 9 to dislodge heavily armed sikh 
radicals that had holed up inside 
the siege ended 10 days later when the indian forces attacked 
the temple in amritsar and drove out the radicals fortysix 
people most of them radicals were killed during the siege 
the five priests were arrested and imprisoned after they tried 
to defy a government curfew on the temple 
at a meeting in amritsar the shiromani gurdwara prabandhak 
committee said monday it appointed five new priests indian news 
agencies reported 
the 160member governing body was quoted as saying it fired the 
priests because they had betrayed the sikh faith it did not 
elaborate 
those fired were jasbir singh rode the most senior sikh priest 
swinder singh leader of the keshgarh sahib shrine in punjab 
kashmir singh head priest of the eternal throne which is the 
complex housing the golden temple puran singh head priest of the 
golden temple and jaswant singh head of the damdama sahib shrine

akal takht harcharan singh was appointed as new chief priest 
united news of india said it did not name the other four new 
priests 
singh is considered a moderate and observers in new delhi say 
his appointment to the highest seat of the sikh faith is an effort 
to isolate the militants 
the central government has been pressing the sikh governing body 
to promise in writing that it will not allow the golden temple to 
be used again as a sanctuary by terrorists but the committee so 
far has not responded 
sikhism was founded about 500 years ago it is an offshoot of 
hinduism that incorporates elements of the moslem religion 
sikhs are only 2 percent of indias 800 million people but they 
are a majority in punjab they claim discrimination by the hindus 
who make up 80 percent of the population 
in june 1984 the indian army carried out a massive raid to 
drive militants from the golden temple more than 1200 people were 
killed 
five months later prime minister indira gandhi was assassinated 
by two sikh bodguards in revenge for the raid setting off 
antisikh rioting in which 2000 people died

former moscow communist party chief boris n 
yelstin on monday accused the kremlins no 2 official yegor k 
ligachev of blocking soviet political reforms and said he should 
quit 
yeltsins criticism of ligachev in an interview with british 
broadcasting corp was an unprecedented case of a fallen soviet 
leader publicly criticizing those who remain in power and publicly 
airing sharp highlevel differences 
it shed light on yeltsins fall from power that culminated in 
his removal feb 18 as a candidate or nonvoting member of the 
ruling communist party politburo 
yeltsin said ligachev the party ideologist should quit 
because processes in the party are too slow because the party is 
still lagging behind because the process of democratization in the 
party does not develop because the style and method of work are 
behind those processes of perestroika and comrade ligachev is the 
main person responsible for this 
in a separate interview with cbs news yeltsin said soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachevs reforms still face resistance 
i think that the process is much slower than we expected 
considerably slower and to overestimate what is happening and to 
speak and to say that everything is going according to plan isnt 
only an error this is a dangerous thing to say 
it wasnt clear why yeltsin chose to speak out on the second day 
of president reagans summit with gorbachev before his downfall 
yeltsin was more accessible than most top soviet officials to 
western reporters and he may have wanted to take advantage of 
heavy news coverage during the summit to get maximum exposure for 
his remarks 
he also may have timed his remarks not so much for the summit 
but for next months party conference at which gorbachevs reforms 
will be reviewed 
yeltsin a towering whitehaired man of 57 has been an 
outspoken supporter of gorbachevs efforts to restructure soviet 
society especially of his call for more open criticism and debate 
of public issues 
his statements to the bbc indicated he had not backed down from 
the criticisms of the partys policies that led to his removal from 
the moscow city leadership and the politburo 
he said he was hurt by gorbachevs refusal to support him after 
he criticized ligachev at an oct 21 1987 meeting of the 
policymaking central committee yeltsin also said he is unhappy 
with his new cabinetlevel job as deputy head of the state 
construction committee 
there have been rumors in moscow for more than a month that 
ligachev and gorbachev had a falling out as the communist party 
prepared for an important conference that begins june 28 
on may 23 the central committee adopted a radical program 
calling for party bureaucrats to stop interfering in the economy 
and government affairs and proposing a limit of two fiveyear terms 
for elected party posts 
asked by a bbc interviewer whether it was possible for ligachev 
to stay in the leadership yeltsin said thats up to the central 
committee 
pressed to say whether he believed ligachev should resign 
yeltsin replied yes 
ligachev 67 has consistently sounded a more conservative theme 
on opening up soviet society in his public statements 
yeltsin confirmed reports that had circulated in moscow that he 
criticized ligachev by name at the central committee meeting 
he is one of the and ill say it straight hes one of the 
opponents when it comes to questions of social justice yeltsin 
said 
his remarks to the central committee never were published but 
gorbachev bitterly attacked yeltsin for being overly ambitious in 
remarks published in the official press 
yeltsin was replaced as moscow party chief nov 11 by lev n 
zaikov 
asked whether he was upset gorbachev did not defend him yeltsin 
responded im upset he feels this and i told him im 
dissatisfied with my present job 
he was removed from the presidium of the supreme soviet the 
countrys highest executive body on may 24 
the bbc interview was conducted in yeltsins moscow office and 
his remarks were translated into english by a soviet interpreter 
the associated press obtained a copy of yeltsins remarks from the 
bbc 
yeltsin also had granted an interview in may to the 
germanlanguage edition of moscow news a weekly organ of the 
official press in which he repeated his criticism of the pace of 
reform

president reagan and mikhail s gorbachev edged 
forward on arms issues monday in a summit session that was eclipsed 
by reagans meeting with dissidents and his challenge that the 
soviet leader usher in a new age of religious freedom 
its time my friend its time the president implored the 
general secretary quoting the prerevolutionary russian poet 
alexander pushkin as he sounded the human rights theme on the 
second day of his fiveday visit 
in an extraordinary meeting with several dozen dissidents and 
refuseniks and members of their families arrayed before him at the 
us ambassadors residence reagan said i came here hoping to 
do what i could to give you strength 
but i already know it is you who have strengthened me you 
have given me a message to carry back while we press for human 
rights through diplomatic channels you press with your very lives 
day in day out year after year risking your jobs your homes 
your all 
he said the united states views human rights as fundamental 
absolutely fundamental to our relations with the soviet union and 
all nations 
the symbolism of reagans meetings spoke volumes that he was 
stepping into domestic matters on soviet soil had rankled gorbachev 
aides before and after the events and the general secretary 
referred to it as he toasted reagan at a state dinner 
gorbachev called for closer contacts with americans but said 
this should be done without interfering in domestic affairs 
without sermonizing or imposing ones views and ways without 
turning family or personal problems into a pretext for 
confrontation between states 
reagan told gorbachev that he will tell the man who the american 
people elect this fall to succeed him that the search for common 
ground must continue 
based on the achievements of the last few years i will also 
tell him it is a search that can succeed the president said 
gorbachev said the two leaders main task is finding a way to 
reduce strategic nuclear weapons by 50 percent and noted the 
tremendous importance of the recent agreement under which the 
superpowers will police the agreement for a soviet pull out from 
afghanistan 
the whole world is watching he said 
the summit session monday focused on arms issues and spokesmen 
said the leaders were likely to sign agreements on two secondary 
pacts and were making progress on a far more significant strategic 
arms accord 
no one was predicting a breakthrough to conclude the socalled 
start negotiations but there was movement in two of the most 
stubborn areas involving mobile missiles and cruise missiles 
launched from warplanes however the presidents strategic defense 
initiative was still under soviet challenge and the united states 
refused to permit soviet inspection of us ships armed with cruise 
missiles 
the arms discussions preceded the presidents two human rights 
events 
even before the first event reagans visit to the danliov 
monastery gorbachev indicated his disagreement with reagans 
appraisal of soviet deficiencies both sides dont have a very 
good idea of what the real situation in the soviet union and the 
united states is he said asked about the list of 14 cases 
turned over by reagan at their first session on sunday the soviet 
leader remarked there are too many lists 
before the dissidents the president praised the recent surge in 
jewish emigration and the release of 300 political prisoners in the 
three years since gorbachev took the kremlin helm 
afterward gennady gerasimov the soviet spokesman described 
the dissidents sourly as not the best of the soviet people 
rather the contrary 
in the past gorbachev and other soviet officials have 
registered irritation with american leaders lecturing them about 
internal practices but reagan clearly aware his words would ring 
around the world committed the united states to the freedom 
movement here 
it is our belief that this is a moment of hope he said 
gerasimov did not belabor the human rights issue his briefing 
on the days activities centered in large part on hopeful 
developments in arms discussions he said the leaders likely would 
would execute two arms control agreements 
neither approaches in importance the treaty to reduce longrange 
nuclear weapons that continued to elude us and soviet negotiators 
meeting in working groups offstage but both are in the 
confidencebuilding category and had been declared 
unattainable by reagan administration officials only two days 
earlier 
one agreement provides for prior notification of missile tests 
the other establishes the procedures for joint experiments with 
monitoring equipment at the us and soviet nuclear test sites in 
nevada and at semipalatinsk 
a senior us official said the two pacts would be signed 
tuesday along with a new cultural agreement if they were completed 
by then 
also gerasimov reported certain progress on monitoring 
cruise missiles carried by warplanes and said a compromise is 
possible at the same time the soviet official said the two 
sides had decided mobile missiles could be stored in designated 
areas in order to keep track of the elusive weapons 
these are two of the main obstacles to a treaty to reduce 
strategic nuclear weapons arsenals by 30 to 50 percent 
however gerasimov said there was no agreement on monitoring 
warships packed with cruise missiles he blamed the united states 
saying it wanted to protect a temporary edge 
we think this is not a serious approach at all he said 
in a latenight briefing a us official who would not be 
identified by name agreed there was headway between reagan and 
gorbachev on airlaunched cruise missiles but he said it is 
still an outstanding issue 
on the mobile missiles the us official disagreed with 
gerasimovs upbeat report we havent heard a verification scheme 
that we think will work he said that is an area of 
significant difference between us 
on sealaunched cruises the us official responded that we 
have yet to see a verification regime which has been applied to 
submarines that we think is desirable 
earlier white house spokesman marlin fitzwater pointed out 
there was significant disagreement on the size of the north 
atlantic treaty organization and warsaw pact ground forces in 
europe

after his 1 hour and 45 minute meeting in the kremlin with 
gorbachev the president visited the danliov monastery on the edge 
of moscow where he was greeted by bearded monks and the rare 
pealing of russian church bells 
there he quoted alexander solzhenitsyn the exiled soviet writer 
and ardent christian who has not relented in criticizing the 
communist system from sanctuary in america 
men must abandon trivial concerns of this world and give time 
and tought to eternity reagan read 
at his spaso meeting with the dissidents three guests made 
brief speeches in which they mixed praise for gorbachevs reforms 
with concern over the pace of reform 
at present despite democratization our lot has not 
improved said yuli kosharovsky a jewish refusenik who has 
sought permission to emigrate for 17 years 
father gleb yakunin a russian orthodox priest who had been 
sentenced to a labor camp and internal exile lamented the 
attempt to convert our state to a country of total atheism 
the rebirth of our native land along the restructuring that 
has already begun is unthinkable without true freedom of 
religion he said 
sergei kovalev lost his job at the university of moscow in 1969 
when he protested the soviet invasion of czechoslovakia he was 
sentenced to a labor camp and his internal exile for his work on a 
publication that reported human rights abuses 
he said dissidents are greeting with optimism the reforms being 
sought by gorbachev but that the course of changes is uncertain

about 200 religious leaders 
from across south africa met in emergency session monday to 
consider new nonviolent strategies against apartheid including 
civil disobedience 
the twoday convocation first of its kind is to end tuesday 
with a service of witness and solidarity at the main roman 
catholic church in soweto johannesburgs largest black township 
desmond tutu the black anglican archbishop who won the 1984 nobel 
peace prize is scheduled to preach 
organizers of the meeting said soweto officials refused to let 
the service be held at an outdoor amphitheater 
workshops were planned on a range of antiapartheid tactics 
including noncooperation and noncollaboration with the 
government the agenda suggested targets of civil disobedience 
targets could include tax payments military service and racially 
oriented laws such as those mandating segregated residential areas 
the convocation is sponsored by the south african council of 
churches which includes major protestant denominations active in 
the fight for black rights the roman catholic church and several 
independent african churches 
in the opening speech the rev frank chikane secretarygeneral 
of the church council said the clergy needs to find effective 
alternatives to antiapartheid violence 
the issue now is how can we go about ending this evil and 
unjust system he said the intransigence and violence of the 
apartheid regime has created a pastoral crisis for the churches in 
south africa as more and more victims of this system have resorted 
to the use of force 
chikane said political conditions have worsened drastically 
since leading clergymen decided in early february to organize the 
convocation 
he cited the effective bannings of 17 antiapartheid 
organizations closure of two opposition newspapers and pending 
legislation to restrict labor unions and opposition political 
groups 
topics to be discussed at the convocation included providing 
pastoral care for victims of apartheid and developing strategies 
of direct action to force the government to negotiate an end to 
apartheid 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs south africas 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services 
chikane said convocation participants should develop a separate 
program to increase international pressure urging foreign 
countries to withdraw their support of the apartheid system 
militarily culturally politically and economically 
tutu chikane and other clergymen have been confronting the 
government since late february when they pledged to carry on the 
work of antiapartheid organizations that were banned 
president pw botha says some church leaders appear to be 
promoting violent revolution they accuse botha of trying to stifle 
opposition to apartheid

defense minister kc pant of india 
conferred with two sri lankan cabinet ministers on monday about 
plans to withdraw the more than 50000 indian troops now assigned 
to this indian ocean island nation 
pant told the ministers that withdrawal should depend on the 
state of the tamil guerrilla separatist campaign said indian 
sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
in turn the sri lankans told pant the indian troops should take 
stronger steps to crush the tamil insurrection in the north and 
east of the island 
it is a complex issue we are going to discuss more on 
tuesday one of the sources said 
pant arrived in colombo monday on a threeday visit and met land 
minister gamini dissanayake and national security minister lalith 
athulathmudali he is to meet president junius r jayewardene on 
tuesday 
indian troops have been deployed in sri lanka under an 
indiasponsored peace plan signed in july 1987 aimed at ending the 
fiveyear tamil separatist war tamil rebels rejected the plan last 
fall and the soldiers moved in to disarm them 
india sponsored the plan partly because of the sympathies of its 
own 60 million tamils for the rebel cause 
tamils constitute 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
the majority buddhist sinhalese community controls the military and 
the government and the rebels claim the tamils suffer 
discrimination 
in another development monday a prosinhalese extremist group 
opposed to the peace plan announced it would observe a twoday 
truce beginning monday because of a festival celebrating the birth 
and enlightenment of lord buddha 
the peoples liberation front which says the peace accord 
grants too many concessions to the tamils has been blamed for at 
least 300 killings in the past 10 months 
two tamil rebels were killed monday when they tried to throw 
hand grenades at an indian patrol near uddupiddy village northeast 
of jaffna about 185 miles northeast of colombo sri lankan 
military forces said 
in fighting at a hindu temple in kalmunai district south of 
batticaloa about 145 miles east of colombo one tamil rebel and 
two tamil civilians were killed residents in the area told the

supreme court justice anthony m kennedy on 
monday halted a georgia school bond election scheduled tuesday 
granting an injunction sought by five black voters who argued that 
the election might violate the voting rights act 
kennedys ruling affects an election which had been scheduled 
for bibb county where voters were being asked to approve bonds to 
pay for air conditioners at the high schools and to construct a new 
high school 
the election had originally been set for the ballot on march 8 
or super tuesday but the county school board decided in january to 
change the balloting date to may 31 
the five black voters sued arguing the march 8 date was changed 
because of a desire by the school board to avoid a date when black 
turnout was expected to be high jesse jackson was the winner of 
the georgia democratic presidential primary 
the five also said the election had not been precleared with 
the justice department which oversees enforcement of the voting 
rights act 
last friday a threejudge appeals refused the voters request 
for an injunction to block the election and they appealed to 
kennedy 
in his fivepage order kennedy noted that county officials 
hadnt met requirements of the voting rights act and said he 
delayed the election because irreparable harm likely would flow 
from a denial of injunctive relief 
permitting the election to go forward would place the burdens 
of interia and litigation delay on those whom the voting rights 
statute was intended to protect despite their obvious diligence in 
seeking an ajudication of their rights prior to the election 
kennedys order delayed the election until the case can be heard 
by the full supreme court

israels two chief rabbis said monday that the 
supreme court meddled in religious affairs by ordering a woman 
seated on a religious council and declared that any man who agreed 
to sit with her was a weakling 
the decision by rabbis avraham shapira and mordechai eliyahu 
pitted the secular law of the jewish state against religious law 
or halacha which many orthodox jews believe is the higher 
two weeks ago the supreme court gave the religious affairs 
minister zevulun hammer 30 days to seat leah shakdiel on the 
religious council of yeruham a town of 6000 people 90 miles south 
of jerusalem 
council members from the centerleft labor party appointed mrs 
shakdiel in march 1986 
local religious leaders supported by the chief rabbis refused to 
seat her they claimed religious law banned women from sitting on 
the council which deals with such local religious affairs as 
appointment of rabbis and construction of synagogues and ritual 
baths 
the supreme court ruled the actions illegal 
shapira who leads israels ashkenazi european jews on monday 
accused the court of interfering with rabbinical autonomy and 
ordered men on the yeruhan council not to sit with mrs shakdiel 
men who sit with women are weaklings he said on israel 
radio they dont care about modesty 
israel radio quoted hammer as saying he would honor the court 
decision and appoint mrs shakdiel to the council it also quoted 
the minister as saying however that he would draft a law 
establishing womens committees to serve alongside the allmale 
religious councils 
i see a possibility which preserves the halacha and at the 
same time gives women the chance to make their contribution right 
away hammer said 
the supreme court also overruled the rabbis last week by 
ordering the tel aviv city government to appoint two women to the 
elective body that will choose the citys next chief ashkenazi 
rabbi 
according the rabbis the halacha prohibits women from electing 
rabbis eliyahu leads israels sephardic jews

protest fumes from a freighter carrying 12000 drums of toxic 
chemical waste delaying the unloading of the vessel thats been 
dubbed the ship of poison 
officials said the syrian freighter zanoobia would not be 
unloaded until the chemicals are analyzed and damaged containers 
repacked which could take several weeks 
four crewmen were treated for nausea and stomach pains possibly 
caused by months of exposure to the toxic cargo three of the 
crewmen were released and the fourth was admitted for observation 
doctors at san martino hospital said 
the 2200 tons of toxic chemical waste produced in italy have 
roamed the seas for 15 months in search of a port that would 
dispose of them djibouti venezuela syria and greece refused 
the zanoobia third ship to carry the chemicals docked in genoa 
on sunday after officials agreed to accept and burn the cargo 
lawyers for the ships owner tabalo shipping say two people 
have died a boy in venezuela and a zanoobia crewman 
on monday the vessel was moved to an isolated dock after 
hundreds of port workers walked off their jobs to protest the 
smell unions said the protest prevented seven other freighters 
from unloading 
ahmed tabalo captain of the zanoobia said some drums of 
chemical waste which has not been identified are damaged and may 
be leaking five crewmen were hospitalized earlier this month 
the condition of my crew is very bad tabalo said after 
docking in genoa for three months we have not entered a port 
now we are all nauseous and sick to the stomach 
his ship had been moored off carrara in northern italy since 
april 26 seeking permission to unload the cargo which was shipped 
from that port in february 1987 
francesco rizzuto a lawyer for tabalo shipping said a group of 
italian chemical companies paid the milanbased company jelly wax 
about 36 cents a pound to dispose of the waste but the company 
shipped it out of the country instead 
it went first to djibouti in east africa which rejected it the 
cargo was unloaded in venezuela but ordered shipped out when the 
boy died reportedly after playing near an opened drum a lawyer 
for the shipping company said 
after that the cargo went to syria and greece 
a zanoobia crewman died during the trip from greece to carrara 
lawyers for tabalo shipping have asked italian prosecutors to file 
charges against jelly wax if the death is shown to have resulted 
from contamination 
officials said the waste will be burned at a genoa incinerator 
at a cost of between 72 cents and 186 a pound

union members struck 17 cemeteries in the 
san francisco bay area monday and a management spokesman said 
burials at the affected cemeteries could be postponed until the 
dispute is settled 
in 1985 more than 800 bodies went unburied until a long strike 
was settled 
our park has pickets out front and our people are honoring 
that said bruce green weekend manager of woodlawn memorial park

associations no new talks were scheduled he said 
the burials will simply have to be postponed cantwell said 
the unions threeyear contract with associated cemeteries and 
the east bay interment properties association expired march 1 
two leading issues in the dispute are cemetery owners use of 
nonunion subcontractors to do work ordinarily handled by fulltime 
workers and the rising cost of health insurance del gaudio said 
but cantwell called subcontracting a sham issue cemeteries 
have always used subcontractors and the owners proposal says no 
workers will be laid off because of subcontracting he said 
the employers also are offering to pay the same amount for 
employee health insurance as under the previous contract cantwell 
said 
cemetery workers currently receive 1435 an hour after 18 
months cantwell said under the employers proposal employees 
would receive raises of 30 cents an hour for each year of a

former white house spokesman larry 
speakes defended nancy reagan on monday against criticism that she 
wields too much power but he did not try to excuse his own action 
in inventing quotations he attributed to the president 
speakes was promoting his recently published book speaking 
out at the american booksellers association convention which 
ends tuesday 
i think everything nancy does comes from her concern as a wife 
to see that her husbands health is protected and that he is a 
success speakes said during a news conference 
as for allegations in a book by donald t regan reagans former 
chief of staff that mrs reagan used an astrologer to help guide 
and influence her husband speakes said i didnt know anything 
about that i guess it was a state secret he kept for his own 
book 
of his own invention of quotations during the 1985 arms control 
summit speakes said i do agree it was wrong but he added 
he doesnt think it was an unusal move for a press secretary 
maybe ive blown the whistle on a longtime white house 
institution he said 
speakes was among a number of celebrities including former first 
lady lady bird johnson newsman david brinkley and cartoonist 
charles schulz who were on hand monday to promote new books 
but the main focus of the convention was the trade show at the 
anaheim convention center where publishers wooed booksellers to 
order their fall lines while authors mingled with editors and 
agents 
its a throwback to the middle ages a fair and a chance to 
discover new issues and new people said aba executive director 
bernie rath everybody brings their own objectives with them 
no central issues dominated meetings by aba members but 
recurrent themes included the rising cost of running a bookstore 
the battle between chain stores and independents and the increasing 
use of technology in ordering and marketing books 
michael j weiss author of the clustering of america told 
the booksellers that they can better target buyers through a 
marketing system that categorizes neighborhoods into 40 groups 
these are given such colorful names as shotguns and pickups and 
furs and station wagons 
this idea that america is a melting pot is a myth he said 
americans dont melt

delegates to a communist party 
conference criticized party leaders monday for not making reforms 
suggested two years ago and said they should be fired unless they 
solve the nations economic problems 
yugoslavia has a foreign debt of 21 billion europes highest 
annual inflation at 170 percent and an unemployment rate of 15 
percent economic problems have caused increasing social and labor 
unrest 
dimitrije kocovic a belgrade delegate said in debate monday 
that the greatest responsibility for not implementing 
resolutions of the last congress in 1986 is borne by presidents 
of the presidium of the central committee in this period milanko 
renovica and bosko krunic 
krunic replaced renovica and currently serves as party leader 
the party chief changes annually under a rotation system among the 
leadership 
criticism of party leaders by name is rare but generalized 
criticism of the leadership in the press has become frequent with 
economic deterioration in the past year 
several delegates said monday a special party congress should 
have been held instead of the threeday conference which comes 
halfway between two party congresses 
unless we carry through a complete social reform by next 
autumn it will be necessary to call a special congress that would 
elect a new leadership slobodan milosevic leader of the serbian 
party told the delegates the leadership will either fulfill the 
desire of the people or the people will replace it 
he apparently referred to the central committee and the ruling 
presidium or politburo whose members are chosen at party 
congresses 
the congresses held every four years have broad powers to 
change rules and personnel but conferences held between them are 
largely advisory the leadership opposed a special congress 
contending the crisis did not require it 
milan kucan communist leader of slovenia urged the national 
party to relinquish its nostalgia for monopoly on power and 
said domination of politics over economy should be eliminated 
demanding political democratization and economic reform 
kucan declared we all want to be a part of europe where we 
belong we want its standards quality organization and 
work not shortages and poverty 
breda blaznik of slovenia the most developed of yugoslavias 
six republics told the conference the workers do not want to 
support a party as ineffective as this one they also do not want 
to live in poverty 
several delegates said the party should not meddle with the 
economy and that more elements of market forces should be 
introduced 
on saturday the government imposed an austerity program that 
includes substantial price increases wage reductions of up to 30 
percent and a 239 percent devaluation of the dinar the national 
currency 
living standards already have declined by about onethird since 
1980 and the unpopular new plan probably will make that situation 
worse 
labor unrest is expected to grow which party chief krunic 
acknowledged in a speech to the conference saturday 
social upheavals are certain to take place and may be grave 
he said but rejected calls for a multiparty system as a way of 
dealing with the crisis 
francka strmole of slovenia demanded in mondays debate the 
adoption of a new constitution more democratic than the current 
one which took effect in 1974 before the death of president tito 
she said a law that allows prosecutions for nonconformist views 
should be changed to cover only violence aimed at overthrowing the 
system 
repression should not be used to prevent free expression 
of opinion she declared

the european economic community pledged 
monday to maintain humanitarian aid to south african antiapartheid 
groups even if these are effectively banned under a bill being 
prepared by the pretoria government 
it did not say how it would do this 
the eec development commissioner lorenzo natali met in 
brussels on friday with south african church leaders from several 
denominations and with leaders of the kagiso trust a south african 
group that aids victims of apartheid 
eec officials said monday that natali assured them of eec 
support of those who use all pacific means to fight for the 
abolition of apartheid 
the common market has earmarked 306 million for humanitarian 
aid to south african opposition groups in 1988 up from 24 million 
in 1987 and 12 million in 1986 
the religious leaders urged the eec to pressure south africa 
into shelving a bill now before south africas parliament and 
likely to be adopted later this year which will let the 
government seize funds from abroad if it believes these will be 
used for political activities 
south african churches and church groups rely heavily on foreign 
funding under the bill they would need government approval to get 
foreign aid 
last week an allparty group in the european parliament urged 
the eec to increase economic sanctions against south africa if it 
tightens up its antiapartheid legislation 
in 1986 the eec banned new investments in south africa and 
halted imports of iron steel and gold coins from the country 
apartheid by law and custom establishes a racially segregated 
society in which south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services

a wells fargo guard wanted for the robbery 
of 25 million from an armored car surrendered to authorities 
monday and the stolen money was recovered hours later the fbi said 
jared layne gray was booked into the salt lake county jail and 
was being held without bail said salt lake county sheriffs cpl 
ralph fisher 
fbi agents said gray accompanied by his lawyer surrendered at 
the fbi office here and was arrested he brought 50000 with him 
and revealed where to find the rest of the stolen cash and the 
full amount was recovered late monday afternoon special agent bob 
lund said 
i think we were somewhat surprised he said wed been 
working on this and on something like this you generally expect to 
go out and make an arrest 
gray one of three wells fargo guards transporting the money 
from boise idaho to the federal reserve bank in salt lake city 
had been sought since he disappeared the night 252 million in 
100 bills was taken from the truck 
authorities said at the time that the truck had stopped at a 
convenience store and the two other guards found themselves locked 
inside by a wedge of wood used to jam the door 
lund declined to say where it was found or to elaborate on 
grays whereabouts since may 5 when the crime occurred 
gray charged with three federal felony counts of theft was 
scheduled to be arraigned tuesday morning before a federal 
magistrate 
lund said he did not know why the guard turned himself in but 
he speculated that a nagging conscience and homesickness were 
factors 
number one he doesnt have a criminal history he said 
number two i think he probably planned this thing out and said 
yeah i can live without my family for a while i can go to south 
america live luxuriously for a long long time 
then he just got to missing these people i think he might 
have had some conscience pangs the agent said 
the day after the robbery gray was charged in us district 
court and a warrant issued for his arrest 
another fbi agent dennis m moler declined to say whether 
further arrests of possible accomplices were forthcoming saying 
only that the investigation was continuing

vandals reportedly smashed jewish graves at a 
cemetery west of moscow and jewish residents of the soviet capital 
said they feared antisemitic incidents during celebrations of the 
millenium of christianity here 
at least one jewish family said it planned to move out of moscow 
for fear of attacks against jews by an antisemitic group using the 
millenium celebration which starts next week as an excuse 
moscow news a weekly that has been at the forefront of soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachevs glasnost policy of greater 
openness reported in its may 29 edition that two drunks smashed 16 
tombstones and damaged 30 others the newspaper claimed the may 15 
incident in a jewish section of vostryakovo cemetery was not 
motivated by antisemitism 
the investigators after the most thorough checkups failed to 
discover any data which would testify to the criminals 
nationalistic motives or to some sort of settling of accounts 
the newspaper said so im convinced that this was a case of 
drunken hooliganism and not an antisemitic action wrote moscow 
news reporter andrei gurkov 
cemetery workers restored the tombstones at a cost of thousands 
of rubles the newspaper said 
avi weiss a leader of american jewish groups said moscow jews 
told him they were concerned about possible antisemitic activities 
during the millenium celebration a bulletin of the union of 
councils for soviet jews based in washington dc also reported 
such fears 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov was asked at a news 
conference monday about the cemetery vandalism he said he didnt 
know about it but that of course these people should be brought 
to justice 
sergei grigoryants a dissident journalist in moscow said in 
midmay he had heard reports that leaflets viciously denouncing 
jews had been circulating in the capital the source of the 
leaflets was unknown 
a 29yearold moscow jew who said he was sending his family to 
lithuania for safety suspected the ultranationalist antisemitic 
group pamyat was behind the campaign 
one of pamyats major points is that jews spoil their lives 
and that the bolshevik revolution was done by jews said the 
man who spoke on condition of anonymity 
he said the group might be using the 1000th anniversary of 
christianity in russia as an excuse to retaliate 
a family acquaintance reported that a group of unidentified 
people warned the owner of a dacha in the moscow suburb of ilinsky 
not to rent the country house to jews or we will burn it down 
the man said another area of dachas popular among jews 
malakhovka is largely unoccupied because of fears of antisemitic 
attacks he said

president oscar arias said monday he 
is seeking the help of two other latin american leaders to 
negotiate a solution to the crisis involving panamas gen manuel 
antonio noriega 
arias said he asked president vinicio cerezo of guatemala and 
carlos andres perez a former president of venezuela to help with 
the negotiations 
as head of panamas defense forces noriega is de factor leader 
of that country the reagan administration has been increasing 
pressure on noriega to quit including economic sanctions on panama 
and freezing panamanian assets in the united states since the 
general was indicted in the united states last february as a drug 
trafficker 
arias who won the 1987 nobel peace prize for his efforts to 
achieve peace in central america said monday this morning i 
telephoned president cerezo and expresident perez to ask them 
that as latin americans they help mediate to find a negotiated 
solution to the crisis in panama 
he spoke with reporters at the presidential palace after meeting 
with joao baena soarez general secretary of the organization of 
american states 
on march 28 perez and spains prime minister felipe gonzalez 
asked the roman catholic archbishop of panama monsignor marcos a 
mcgrath to mediate in the crisis 
we had proposed such negotiations but the united states 
interfered in the conflict and it failed it is now up to us as 
latin americans to find a latin american solution to the panamanian 
crisis arias said 
i think that perez as a member of the socialist 
international and cerezo as a christian democrat would be good 
representatives in this mediation with panamanian political 
sectors where all ideologies are represented 
the christian democratic party is one of the main opposition 
groups to the noriegabacked government in panama 
noriegas handpicked president eric arturo delvalle tried to 
fire the general on feb 26 but noriega got the national 
legislature to fire delvalle instead delvalle has since been in 
hiding in panama 
months of secret negotiations between a state department envoy 
and noriega representatives failed to dislodge the general 
arias won the nobel peace prize last year for drawing up a 
central american peace plan last august to end the war by 
ussupported rebels in nicaragua and to end leftist guerrilla

for the 11th day in a row weather monday 
forced a delay of a test burn of a pershing ii rocket motor and 
now the army is bumping up against a tuesday deadline for the test 
because of the newly ratified treaty with the soviet union 
officials said 
the burn originally scheduled for may 20 was delayed again 
monday when winds gusted to 50 mph out of the southeast at the 
pueblo army depot about 15 miles from pueblo 
spokesman mary wilson said the test was rescheduled for tuesday 
morning if weather permits if the test is not conducted by the 5 
pm deadline it will not be able to be scheduled for at least 30 
days 
the test burn would be the first step toward determining the 
suitability of using the pueblo army depot as a site for destroying 
the armys 420 pershing missile fleet as a condition of the new 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty 
tuesday is the last day the test can be conducted before the 
united states and the soviet union formally exchange the documents 
of the inf treaty wednesday at the summit meeting in moscow the 
treaty was ratified by the senate last week 
then it becomes governed by the treaty wilson said if we 
were to test fire it it is then treated as an eliminination of a 
weapon under the treaty and subject to inspection by the soviet 
inspectors 
theyd have to witness it we have to give them 30 days 
notice for an elimination inspection she said 
army and colorado department of health officials have set up 50 
collection stations on and off the army depot grounds to collect 
the chemical fallout from the rocket burning to determine if any of 
the pollutants would be harmful 
in order to keep pollution problems to a minimum the army is 
allowed to conduct a test burn only if there are winds aloft 
greater than 8 mph blowing from the west relative humidity under 
70 percent and a cloud ceiling greater than 5000 feet there also 
must be a mixing between the layers of the atmosphere and the test 
must be done by late afternoon 
the health department is requiring the test before the army can 
designate the depot for the 9 million program wilson said because 
the army stores and maintains pershings at pueblo the installation 
is the preferred site for demolishing them but three other 
installations also are being considered for the project that would 
create as many as 120 jobs

the strike to keep attention focused on the uprising during the 
ussoviet summit in moscow 
but dozens of arab buses some crowded with standing passengers 
rolled from the occupied west bank and gaza strip carrying 
palestinians workers to israel in the gaza strip shops were open 
and transit was operating 
estimates by arabs of how many palestinians went to work in 
israel ranged from 10 percent in some areas to 50 percent in 
others the army said more than half the 110000 palestinians who 
work in israel showed up at their jobs 
israeli leaders and some palestinians said the fizzled strike 
showed support for the underground leadership was waning but other 
arabs said a leaflet ordering the protest caused confusion and was 
not widely distributed 
in the gaza strips jabaliya refugee camp a protest broke out 
after a 28yearold palestinian woman was shot and her 9monthold 
daughter lost an eye when israeli troops fired rubber bullets 
during a clash 
officials at shifa hospital said the woman najah ahmed masoub 
was shot in the left arm and her daughter huda lost her left eye 
arab reports said the injuries came as mrs masoub tired to 
block soldiers from arresting her brother the army said it was 
investigating the report 
since the unrest began dec 8 198 palestinians and two israelis 
have been killed 
leftwing legislator dedi zucker of the citizens rights 
movement told defense minister yitzhak rabin that soldiers harshly 
beat palestinian prisoners on their way to jail 
in a letter to rabin zucker submitted an affidavit from a 
reserve soldier ariel stemker who said he saw a 12yearold arab 
boy brutally clubbed as he emerged from an army bus transporting 
him to dahariye prison near hebron 
a soldier started to beat the boy on the barbed wire in a 
deliberate attempt to injure him stemker wrote he grabbed the 
boy from behind then holding him by the hair and the seat of the 
pants threw him up in the air and tried to cut his face 
stemker said the soldier ignored his shouts to stop and instead 
threw the boy with all his force into a wall head first the 
boy who had been crying started to scream from pain the soldier 
kicked him and a jailer beat him on the back with a club 
underground leaders urged arabs to shut down the occupied lands 
and fly the outlawed palestinian flag as president reagan and 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev meet 
palestinian flags were flying in jenin and nablus the west 
banks largest city new graffiti on walls in bethlehem warned 
merchants not to open during the strike 
but the leaflet did not circulate in the gaza strip nablus 
businessman saed kenaan said some palestinians were confused by the 
strike call because a previous leaflet did not order a general 
strike on monday 
other arabs said the strikes failure showed palestinians were 
growing tired of frequent calls for strikes 
the leadership is pushing things way too far they are asking 
the impossible said farah el araj the mayor of beit jallah 
they call for supporting and developing local palestinian 
industry and then they call for more strikes 
mubarak awad an arabamerican activist who faces deportation 
from israel said he would ask us officials to arrange a meeting 
with us secretary of state george p shultz during his visit june

some champions of reform already have sunk in the 
untested waters of political competition here one of the victims 
said monday 
prominent political scientist and writer fyodor m burlatsky 
said cmmunist party activists are feeling their way through 
democratic elections to the party conference on june 28 a major 
event that will be attended by 5000 delegates 
burlatsky confirmed monday that the conference will not name any 
new people to the 300member policymaking central committee in 
part to protect the committee headed by mikhail s gorbachev from 
detrimental changes 
if elections to the party conference have become so difficult 
how do we know elections to the central committee wont be tied up 
by some of these negative factors he commented 
burlatsky fell with the fortunes of nikita s khrushchev the 
late former premier but resurfaced to back gorbachevs 
perestroika campaign of restructuring soviet society 
he said the partys charter does not spell out procedures for 
selecting delegates to party conferences 
we are learning democracy finding a style as we go the 
political scientist said it is certainly experimental 
the last party conference was in 1941 and times have changed 
radically and old ways of choosing delegates are no longer 
relevant he said 
burlatsky historian yuri afanasyev and tatyana zaslavskaya 
the nations most prominent sociologist are among those turned 
down by regional party authorities after being selected by their 
local groups as candidates to attend the conference 
exclusion of such noted backers of reform prompted 
demonstrations in moscow and leningrad over the weekend and 
accusations that the selection process was rigged 
burlatsky brushed off suggestions that the absence of some 
perestroika advocates could allow conservatives within the party to 
slow or damage the reform program the conference will consider a 
slate of policy decisions and proposals from delegates that will 
form a blueprint for legislative changes 
mikhail sergeyevichs policies and programs are sufficiently 
strong enough to carry the conference burlatsky said 
he joked that his absence would take its toll but i dont 
think it is dangerous to perestroika 
in effect the party conference will pass judgment on 
gorbachevs reforms and determine their future 
among the proposals are suggestions for jury trials relaxation 
of restrictions on religion reform of the criminal justice system 
limits on the political terms of party officials and some formal 
sanctioning of the informal groups springing up in the soviet 
union which burlatsky said now number about 30000 the groups 
which are unofficial but sometimes tolerated have come together to 
press causes like environmental protection and individual freedoms 
instances where gorbachevs backers failed to get elected as 
delegates were sometimes the result of individual party officials 
striking their names from lists forwarded by factories institutes 
and local party organizations burlatsky said 
there were cases where regional secretaries themselves for 
formalistic reasons withdrew certain names burlatsky said 
using a term that suggests conservatism 
ms zaslavskaya criticized the delegate selection process at a 
news conference last week saying the choices had not in every case 
been beneficial for the fate of gorbachevs reforms

not comment on the matter until after independent counsel james 
mckay completes his investigation and issues his report on meese 
meese himself said in a broadcast interview that he would hurt 
bush if he stepped down now 
if i were to quit now for example it would be a real 
liability because people would say there was something wrong he 
said in an interview on cnns larry king live on monday night

they talked frankly about the campaign 
i think its important to george bushas well as myself that

convention and the campaign and i hope in what we do afterward 
participants in the meeting said dukakis promised to offer 
jackson campaign aides jobs in the fall campaign and also said 
blacks and minorities would hold major positions in a dukakis 
administration

is going to have to be expanded said charlene drew jarvis a 
district of columbia council member who attended the session we 
got that commitment today from michael dukakis he was clear 
that the issues that are important to black americans are issues 
that are going to be important to him 
jackson spoke approvingly of the gathering he dukakis has 
an obligation to reach out he said 
of the part he will play when the primary season is over 
jackson said i expect to have a big role at the convention and a 
big role this fall that role has not been determinedi will 
exercise my own options 
dukakis who has more than 1700 of the 2081 delegates needed 
to win the nomination is expected to reach the magical number on

hunter college has closed two classroom 
buildings because they contain tons of chemicals that have turned 
toxic and potentially explosive with age the citys environmental 
department said monday 
some of the chemicals found in science laboratories and storage 
rooms were as much as 30 years old said joan paylo spokeswoman 
for the city department of environmental protection 
its an unbelievable example of environmental and scientific 
mismanagement she said no one remembers when such a store of 
chemicals was discovered in a nonprofit type of setting 
college officials first became aware that toxic and potentially 
explosive chemicals were present in the two buildings may 11 when 
the fire department discovered some samples of ether during a 
routine inspection said college spokesman robin elliott 
subseqent investigations by the college the citys 
environmental agency and other city agencies revealed tons of 
expired chemicals in the two buildings and the city asked that the 
buildings be closed ms paylo said 
some of the substances have already been removed with part of 
the work being done by the police bomb squad officials said 
classes at the college ended for the year two weeks ago and 
registration for the schools summer session is not expected until 
june 8 
elliott said the colleges policy had been to leave the 
regulation of materials to individual researchers in the labs 
the discovery of the dangerous chemicals shows that you cant 
leave this important safetyrelated area to individual people he

lack of an alternative to military 
rule and a protest movement so wellmannered it apparently is no 
threat have stymied us attempts to force gen manuel antonio 
noriega from power 
for his part the general uses the populist appeal that has 
characterized 20 years of de facto military rule and deflects the 
spotlight from himself noriega says the issue is not whether he 
stays or goes but panamas dignity and selfdetermination 
this plays well in a country that knows it was created in 1903 
essentially for washingtons convenience and where a new 
nationalism sparked by the panama canal treaties burns brightly

the war in afghanistan has cut that 
nations food production by onehalf and the devastated cropland 
cannot support the immediate return of millions of refugees 
according to a study released monday 
the survey said it will take at least three years and 4 billion 
to restore cropland and livestock affected by 10 years of fighting 
in afghanistan other officials have said such reconstruction could 
take 10 to 20 years 
professor azam gul an afghan citizen who directed the sixmonth

the us dollar moved higher against other major 
currencies in europe monday amid optimism that a technical rally 
could continue 
the price of gold held steady 
the dollars strength reflected continued upward momentum after 
the currency broke through the technical barrier of 17100 west 
german marks late friday dealers said 
during mondays trading it rose further to pierce the 
17280mark point 
a trader at a foreign bank in frankfurt said the dollar could 
rise further but warned that investors are likely to remain 
somewhat tentative until the next batch of us trade figures are 
released in midjune 
some traders said there was little fundamental strength in the 
dollar and that the upward move may have been exaggerated by the 
thinness of the market 
markets were closed in singapore london and new york on monday 
for national holidays but dealings were active in frankfurt 
the dollar rose nearly a cent against the british pound it cost 
18478 to buy one pound in europe cheaper than 18570 in london 
late friday 
in tokyo where the business day ends before europes begins 
the dollar rose 034 yen to a closing 12498 yen later in europe 
it was quoted lower at 12408 yen 
other late dollar rates in europe compared with late friday

new york nearly caught up with california to be 
the state with the most residents working for foreign bosses in 
1986 according to newly compiled government statistics 
nationwide employment by foreign bosses rose 4 percent and 
britain remained the biggest employer the commerce department says 
in a report to be published in midjune 
figures for 1987 will not be compiled until this time next year 
a delay caused by the difficulty of collecting employment 
statistics from thousands of foreignowned companies 
the report says 296 million americans worked in 1986 for 
foreign bosses specifically operations other than banks that had 
at least 10 percent foreign ownership 
california held onto the no 1 spot by just 27 people as its 
total shrank and new yorks grew rapidly 
next were texas new jersey illinois pennsylvania ohio north 
carolina georgia and florida south dakota was last just behind 
north dakota 
in spite of the attention that japanese investors have received 
in recent years they ranked only fifth as bosses of americans 
behind the british canadians west germans and dutch 
the commerce department does not disclose foreign employers by 
name but it is obvious that some of the big deals of 1986 had an 
impact on the numbers 
for example the 34 billion acquisition of allied stores corp 
by canadas campeau corp helps explain why canadas us 
employment jumped by about 75000 
on the other hand west germanys overall us employment 
dropped a whopping 100000 largely because wr grace amp co no 
longer counted in its totals grace repurchased 26 percent of its 
shares from the flick industrial group of west germany for 596 
million 
although japans us employment rose only about 2 percent its 
heavy investments in the united states especially financial 
companies caused its us assets to shoot up 51 percent 
with 967 billion in us assets japan ranked third behind 
britains 1338 billion and canadas 1295 billion 
the report completed in early may will be published in the may 
issue of the departments survey of current business which is 
released in midjune

trucks the size of houses rumble in and out 
of the donora mining pit with sandbox simplicity 
with each round trip to a nearby processing plant they bring 
north americas last working open pit mine of highgrade natural 
iron ore about 100 tons closer to extinction 
at one time we thought the natural ore on the mesabi range was 
going to last forever said gb morey chief geologist for the 
minnesota geological survey 
that was in the 1890s when the nations largest deposits of 
moist black and blue ore were being discovered on the mesabi 
vermilion and cuyuna ranges in northeastern minnesota about 282 
billion tons and two world wars later the donora pit just east of 
aurora at the mckinley extension mine is all thats left 
there are other natural ore deposits scattered around the great 
lakes in canada and the western united states but none that can 
be profitably mined with todays technology morey said abundant 
taconite a flintlike rock containing a lowgrade iron ore that is 
extracted and converted into pellets has replaced it as the main 
source for steel 
you cant ever say its dead morey said of natural iron ore 
mining but its the end of an era 
don lemay northwest ore division manager for ltv steel co 
said the canyonsized donora pit his company leases from us steel 
co is expected to be scraped clean of the precious mineral in 
another three or four years 
yes were going to miss it lemay said we cherish that 
type of material 
compared to taconite natural iron ore is steelmakers gravy 
for every 100 tons scooped from the 1200acre donora pit and 
sifted through a washing plant about 80 tons are left for the 
blast furnace by the time 100 tons of taconite are processed into 
oregrade pellets only 33 tons are left for making steel 
in addition a ton of natural ore costs less to produce and 
burns more efficiently in blast furnaces because it is first shaped 
into a porous rocklike material by fusing it with another compound 
lemay said the donora supply of natural ore has given ltv a 
small competitive edge over other us steelmakers who rely on the 
abundance of highgrade natural ore in brazil and other countries 
in addition to domestic and canadian taconite ltv ships its 
natural ore from duluth to indiana harbor ind where it is made 
into steel 
our operation has been going out of business ever since i 
joined it said mike sterk manager of engineering 
we consider ourselves a vanishing breed said gene garner 
mine engineer 
when ltv filled its first train car of natural ore at the mine 
in 1983 the workers followed tradition and planted an evergreen 
tree in it 
that was when they were still digging in the stephens pit 
started by us steel when that pit was nearly exhausted in the 
fall of 1983 digging commenced at the adjacent donora pit more 
than 3 million tons of the resource have been removed from the site 
since then and another 3 million tons are left sterk said by the 
time the shovels are scraping quartzite at the bottom theyll be 
350 feet below the upper rim 
coworkers paul kaska 52 of gilbert and matt turner 49 of 
eveleth say the end sometime in 1992 will be bittersweet theyll 
miss the fraternity developed during long years of natural ore 
mining all over the range but enjoy the leisure of retirement 
kaska said all but about a half dozen of the 70 hourly wage earners 
at donora will be eligible for a pension when the end arrives the 
others may find work in ltvs taconite operations on the iron 
range they said 
no more eating out of lunch buckets kaska said and i 
remember once that i had to work when it was 52 below zero 
turner said the wage and pension cuts accepted by union workers 
during the mining depression earlier in the decade will be among 
his biggest memories and he said many men are looking forward to 
the day when they dont have to drive to work as natural ore 
operations moved east along the mesabi most miners stayed in their 
hometowns and were left with drives of up to 90 miles away to 
aurora 
were not going to be too terribly sorry when she goes 
turner said 
morey said the end of natural ore mining on the iron range is 
also likely to remind natives of the region that the largest 
benefactors of the resource were the eastern steel companies 
its one of the real sore points in this whole thing morey 
said we produced the material and we got very little out of it 
certainly the history isnt ideal from the states point of view 
but the history wont be written until the last load of 
highgrade natural iron ore is shipped off the range like the last 
loads shipped out of the ranges other ore pits it will be aptly 
decorated with a broom

while soviet authorities wage a domestic war 
against rampant alcoholism they are giving vladimir a yamnikov 
their official blessing to perfect a supervodka for export to 
american drinkers 
we dont drink it we just make it said yamnikov the 
jovial 48yearold director of the crystal distillery one of two 
soviet plants that make stolichnaya vodka 
no production or sales restrictions apply to the export of 
stolichnaya which is billed as the only authentic russian vodka 
available in the united states although soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev has sharply reduced the volume of vodka available for 
domestic consumption 
last week in advance of the fourth reagangorbachev summit 
yamnikov took american reporters on a tour of his sprawling red 
brick factory in moscow where employees get a double message from 
management work hard so others can drink but dont drink 
yourselves 
red banners hanging along the walls and dimly lit hallways 
pungent with vodka fumes urge workers to increase quality and 
productivity one poster depicted a man drowning inside a vodka 
bottle and warned that alcohol can cause a collapse of hopes 
long before joint business ventures between soviet and western 
companies became fashionable pepsico struck a deal with the 
soviets in 1972 pepsico buys stolichnaya for resale in the united 
states and the soviets produce pepsi cola at 20 plants 
the key to making good vodka is purity said chief plant 
engineer oleg m ivanov pure alcohol and pure water 
under his supervision raw alcohol is poured into stainless 
steel columns four stories high and is separated into different 
densities alcohol of a certain density is selected for stolichnaya 
and slowly trickles through gray metal cylinders containing three 
sets of activated charcoal filters 
the purified alcohol is then mixed with moscow tap water that 
itself has been filtered 
the best alcohol goes to the two stolichnaya export production 
lines where 58 bottles a minute are filled by machine and packed 
by hand into boxes labeled made in the ussr in english 
the biggest market for stolichnaya is the united states where 
12 million oneliter bottles are sold annually when superpower 
relations are good 
us sales plummeted when soviet troops intervened in 
afghanistan in late 1979 and again in 1983 when the soviets shot 
down a south korean jetliner but pepsico says sales soared during 
the washington summit meeting between president reagan and 
gorbachev last december and the company expects the moscow summit 
to provide another sales boost 
sounding like a marketoriented capitalist yamnikov says he 
hopes to whet american drinkers tastes with an experimental new 
supervodka which he plans to market under the golden ring 
label 
we are keeping the original recipe but improving the quality 
of alcohol and purifying the water he said we are developing 
the product 
between drags on marlboro cigarettes and gulps from shot glasses 
of his vodka yamnikov told reporters that the temptation is 
enormous for his employees to help themselves to vodka whose 
domestic sales have been restricted 
whiteuniformed zhena buganova a plump blonde in her 50s who 
inspects the passing bottles of stolichnaya said workers are 
allowed to take some of the vodka only during holidays and only if 
they pay for it 
vodka for domestic consumption such as the pshenichnaya label 
is produced with less care and at a faster pace using older 
equipment that breaks down frequently to comply with government 
orders to slash production by 43 percent only three of the five 
domestic bottling lines are operating 
the communist party newspaper pravda reported in late 1987 that 
out of a soviet population of more than 284 million people there 
were more than 45 million registered alcoholics of whom about 
1 million required compulsory care 
yamnikov said gorbachevs sales and production curbs are not the 
best way to combat alcoholism 
the main reason for alcoholism is a lack of selfdiscipline 
he said yamnikov believes soviets should be taught to drink in 
moderation through social education 
the high prices and limited availability of alcoholic beverages 
has driven many soviet drinkers to illegal moonshining the labor 
newspaper trud reported recently that moonshiners actually are 
outproducing the legal alcoholic industry 
export vodka is treated here as though it were liquid gold a 
valuable source of hard foreign currency a law that took effect 
this year allows yamnikovs factory to receive up to 20 percent of 
its income in hard currency he said the rest goes to the 
government 
yamnikov looks to the day when the crystal plant will produce 
only vodka for export he says he will use his share of the hard 
currency to buy foreign bottling and packaging equipment and 
improve social services for his 1200 employees

after three years of mikhail s gorbachevs 
reforms the underpinnings of the soviet economy have been 
strengthened but people are still standing in long lines for scarce 
supplies of food and shoddy consumer goods 
unfortunately the majority of soviet families are not 
witnessing the material benefits of perestroika abel aganbegyan 
the soviet leaders chief economic adviser said at a presummit 
news conference 
under gorbachevs perestroika policy of economic 
restructuring he said the soviet union is building more housing 
producing more milk and meat and spending more money on health 
care and education 
the soviet people however are still awaiting the fruits of 
perestroika as gorbachev and president reagan hold their fourth 
round of summit talks this week they have queued even for such 
basic items as sugar of which the soviet union produces more than 
any other country 
aganbegyan said gorbachev and his advisers are seeking a 
breakthrough in consumer goods and services in the next two or 
three years 
as reforms take hold he said soviet authorities should be able 
to stop food imports by the mid1990s and start buying a few more 
foreign consumer goods to satisfy a huge pentup domestic demand 
but aganbegyan says that in the meantime two key elements 
price reform and creation of a convertible currency must be put 
into place 
another more radical economist nikolai shmelev of the soviets 
usa and canada institute says reforms must seek to end the 
economys chronic inefficiency 
according to shmelev 
20 percent of the countrys production capacity lies idle 
because of a labor shortage while other sectors of the economy are 
overstaffed by 25 percent some 25 percent of our manpower could 
be released tomorrow and there would be no effect on production 
he said 
the soviet union manufactures seven times as many tractors as 
the united states but must import american food 
the soviets produce more shoes per capita than any nation but 
still imports shoes to meet consumer demand for fashion and good 
quality 
an estimated 200 billion rubles 320 billion languish in 
savings accounts because there is no way the money can be invested 
or used to buy goods and services 
perestroika aimed to decentralize control over the soviet 
economy by giving local managers a greater share of the 
responsibilities and choices now exercised by moscow bureaucrats 
gorbachev also is trying to encourage a small cooperative sector to 
provide consumer items that a stateoperated economy cannot 
the communist party central committee in a report adopted 
monday for a party conference to be held next month said 
gorbachevs reforms had pulled the economy away from the brink of 
crisis 
aganbegyan said 34 million new apartments are being built every 
year the party and government also have begun a costly 
hospitalbuilding program invested an additional 11 billion rubles 
18 billion in education including teacher pay raises and 
have boosted food production by 8 percent over the average of the 
previous fiveyear plan 
price reforms which are to take effect in the early 1990s must 
reduce the 60 billion rubles 100 billion the soviet government 
pays every year in subsidies for bread milk meat and other foods 
aganbegyan said 
the subsidies may be trimmed to between 10 billion and 20 
billion rubles he said but probably cannot be eliminated entirely 
aganbegyan and other economists have promised consumers the 
state will compensate them for higher prices no price reform 
details have been announced 
price reform is being touted as the first step toward making the 
ruble convertible 
such a move probably would result in a sharp drop in the rubles 
value against western currencies compared to current official 
soviet rates but convertibility would stimulate the foreign trade 
needed by the soviets to buy modern technology and enter into joint 
business with foreign companies 
if other economic reforms take hold aganbegyan said the soviet 
union then would begin importing more goods to give its consumers a 
wider selection

for 29 years wilbur hany was the loyal company 
man working at the general electric co plant in bloomington ill 
but he found his years of service didnt protect his job and 
like thousands of older workers he has sued his former employer 
charging age discrimination 
i never thought it would come to this said hany who now 
makes ends meet by doing yard work and other odd jobs 
no doubt i was a company man i built a house within two miles 
of the job so i could be closer to it he said now i got house 
payments and no job 
as companies lay off older workers to save money many former 
employees are fighting back with lawsuits 
just this month in illinois nearly 40 former managers of 
caterpillar inc in peoria and about 50 exemployees of a wilson 
foods corp meat plant in monmouth filed suits charging age 
discrimination 
the equal employment opportunity commission in washington has 
reported a substantial increase in the number of age discrimination 
charges nationwide in the last five years 
in 1987 the commission received 11627 complaints up from 
13854 in 1986 and 9207 in 1982 
thomas j goger editorinchief of the washingtonbased 
research institute of america inc which focuses on employment 
law said age discrimination complaints are occurring at a faster 
rate today due in part to corporate restructuring 
but if companies retain employees solely on the basis of 
seniority they may face complaints from recently hired workers 
under an affirmative action plan goger said 
he advised businesses facing cutbacks to take great care in 
handling layoffs by carefully documenting the reasons for their 
decisions 
the lawsuit filed by the former wilson employees contends that 
workers near retirement age lost out on severance benefits when the 
company closed the monmouth plant and laid off 600 workers as part 
of a restructuring plan in 1986 
landon toland a spokesman for wilson said the monmouth plant 
was sold to another company last year he declined comment on the 
suit 
the suit against caterpillar the manufacturer of farm and heavy 
equipment contends that managers in their 50s who took 
voluntary retirement were forced to accept the companys offer 
the managers were told that they were facing dismissal or demotions 
if they did not retire the suit alleges 
these managers settled for a pension plan that paid them 
onethird to onefourth of what they had been earning the suit 
said they are seeking lost wages benefits and pensions as well as 
reinstatement to their old jobs 
caterpillar called the suit unfounded 
the company in a prepared statement said it had to cut its 
salaried work force in peoria by 25 percent because it was 
suffering from a severe and unprecedented business recession in 
the 80s 
margaret fernandez a spokeswoman for the eeoc in washington 
says most age discrimination complaints are settled quietly out of 
court with a monetary award 
but some cases like hanys involve extensive litigation 
general electric is appealing a jurys decision in favor of hany 
and 14 other former workers that found the company guilty of 
engaging in age discrimination at its bloomington plant 
tom palette a ge spokesman in bloomington declined comment on 
the pending litigation 
despite the suit hany still has fond memories of his job i 
loved what i did and the people i worked with he said shoot 
id go back to work tomorrow for them and be glad

the senate seems prepared to sustain president 
reagans trade veto but the administrations supporters are pushing 
for quick approval of a more moderate version the bills sponsors 
say 
were in a position where it will be extremely difficult to 
have a second bill senate finance committee chairman lloyd 
bentsen dtexas told reporters last week following a 308113 
house vote to override reagans veto 
reagan vetoed the measure focusing largely on its provision to 
require companies to provide their employees with 60day notice of 
plant closings and largescale layoffs within hours the house 
replied by voting to enact the bill over the presidents objections 
the senate appears set to vote on the override move when 
lawmakers return from this weeks memorial day recess but sponsors 
are frank to say they doubt their chances of duplicating their 
success in the house 
its an uphill fight bentsen said we have to have 
another three votes and at this point i dont know where they 
are 
but talk persists of a revised bill that would sail through 
congress once the smoke over the first one cleared house minority 
leader robert h michel rill raised it as a possibility and 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan declared it the most 
likely outcome 
sponsors see as one weak link in the administrations armor the 
raft of special goodies that lawmakers tucked into the bill and 
which they would like to deliver to the constituents this year 
one example the bill would repeal the 1980 windfall profits tax 
on oil companies the tax is hated in texas as one that singles out 
an industry that has been suffering since oil prices took a dive in 
1985 
i get paid to take political risks sen phil gramm 
rtexas told reporters after voting against the legislation he 
was critical of the plantclosings provision which he said would 
hurt the economy 
he also has been predicting legislation later this year that 
will repeal the windfall tax possibly a strippeddown trade bill 
indeed a chorus ranging from us trade representative clayton 
k yeutter to the national association of manufacturers has been 
calling for a new bill once the senate sustains reagans veto of 
the current one 
once the presidents veto is sustained in the senate we and 
our more than 13000 manufacturing members will throw all our 
weight behind a new unencumbered trade bill said a statement 
from alexander b trowbridge president of the national association 
of manufacturers 
sen paul simon dill said he had already been contacted by 
three different industries in illinois who want amendments on a 
revised bill and if its happening in illinois its happening in 
new york its happening in wyoming its happening all over 
he said he told the industries however that i think its 
unlikely that a second bill is going to emerge 
lawmakers are all but universal is saying such a strippeddown 
bill just might win approval in the house where leaders can clear 
the way and shove aside cumbersome amendments that could bog down 
the measure 
the senate is another matter the bills supporters have been 
raising the prospect of a galaxy of amendments designed to please 
business and other interests back home on election eve and a rash 
of filibusters to go with them 
in fact sen howard m metzenbaum dohio said earlier that he 
would filibuster any stripped down bill unless it contained the 
plantclosings 
senate majority leader robert byrd has not closed the door on 
getting such a measure through the senate but he has said 
repeatedly that there cannot be a quick turnaround on the 
issue that under senate rules it would be very difficult to get 
such legislation through in the time remaining this year and that 
anyone pinning his hopes on a second bill is being naive

taiwan is replacing the united states 
and japan as the main foreign investor in the philippines trade 
secretary jose concepcion said monday 
the government has predicted that foreign investment will grow 
from 420 million last year to between 1 billion and 15 billion 
by the end of this year concepcion said 
the united states is expected to account for between 25 percent 
and 30 percent of the total with japan accounting for about 20 
percent 
if we look at a billion dollars probably 40 percent will be 
from taiwan concepcion said he attributed the increase to an 
appreciation of the taiwan dollar the philippines proximity to 
taiwan and low labor costs here 
he said the taiwanese also were becoming less interested in 
investing elsewhere in southeast asia 
thailand has begun to cool off as far as investments 
concepcion said they are putting more restrictions and so we 
are seeing more of these investments coming in 
taiwanese investments in the philippines have centered on the 
plastics and garment industries 
concepcion appeared at a breakfast forum to discuss us 
proposals for a massive aid program for the philippines known here 
as a minimarshall plan 
the secretary said he favored using any funds to build up the 
countrys agriculture which accounts for about 70 percent of 
export earnings 
what we need is not the minimarshall plan but an 
agroindustrial plan which would beef up our economy he said 
us officials have not disclosed details but the washington 
post said last month that the united states would work with its 
allies to put together a 10 billion package modeled after the 
marshall plan that rebuilt japan and western europe after world war

a judicial writing swat team is taking aim 
at judicial and legal gobbledygook 
or as the lawyers might say said parties of the first part are 
endeavoring to render obsolete henceforth what has heretofore been 
an overabundance of wherefores and whereases of the said parties of 
the second part 
the selfdescribed team is a group of english professors from 
the university of maryland at college park who have traveled the 
country for 10 years teaching judges how to get to the point 
lucidity and clarity thats what were after said robert 
coogan one the professors 
the writing course running two to five days brings common 
sense formulas to courtroom prose said charles rutherford a 
college park instructor 
often times judges will make their decision in the last 
paragraph on the last page forcing the reader to wade through page 
after page of legal prose 
its like reading an agatha christie novel said rutherford 
one of the legal writing tenets taught at the seminars says an 
opinion should start with an introduction of the cases 
circumstances to orient the readers followed by the decision and 
an orderly outline of the issues and legal precedent 
you have to take the reader by the hand said rutherford 
archaic words and common repetitive phrases such as in 
connection with and pertaining to or null and void 
should be used as infrequently as possible according to the 
tutors if the crime was committed at the seveneleven store they 
judges might say said store in their decisions we come down 
hard on that rutherford said youd never think of saying that 
in a conversation unless youre a really constipated person 
the result said rutherford is a shorter more efficient 
opinion less characterized by the usual words of the profession 
and much more readable 
judge jonathan j kaplan of the superior court in hartford 
conn recently took the course 
the first day of the seminar i was told one of opinions was 
numbingly long and it was true said kaplan my very first 
paragraph was a page and a half long youre going to lose your 
reader that way 
latin still has its hooks in legal writing because it was the 
original language of the law 
the root of the writing problems dates back to 14th century 
english common law ideas were expressed more than once because as 
common law developed three languages latin french and english 
were used 
kaplan said judges in general simply dont learn how to write 
clearly and succinctly 
when you become a lawyer or a judge you become more and more 
verbose he said 
the seminar said kaplan has made his writing easier and more 
readable 
judge paul gartzke of the wisconsin court of appeals agreed 
that most judges are rarely good writers 
everyone that graduates from college thinks they can write 
then when they graduate from law school they believe they can write 
and then when they become judges they realize theyre all wrong and 
they cant write legal opinions said gartzke whos taken the 
writing course with the universitys professors several times 
judges flounder around in their written opinions imagine the 
poor devil that has to read them said gartzke 
states require judges to take a varying number of continuing 
education credits a year and the writing course is one of many 
possible options 
they accept what we can say we acknowledge their superiority 
on legal matters and if we make a mistake they jump on us said 
coogan

king fahd on monday reiterated the 
need for opec members to stick to the cartels quotas and prices so 
that the world oil market will stabilize 
if intentions be pure and all member states abide by the opec 
rulings this will be in the interest of all oil producing and 
consuming states alike fahd was quoted by saudi press agency as 
saying at the cabinets weekly session 
fahd had expressed the same view ahead of aprils meeting of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries in vienna where 
ministers discussed means of propping up the flagging oil prices 
around an 18abarrel benchmark 
six nonopec oil producers earlier had proposed a 5 percent cut 
in output by oil producers inside and outside the cartel a demand 
backed by iran but it was rejected by saudi arabia and other gulf 
countries within opec and the meeting ended inconclusively 
the issue will be taken up again when the cartel convenes again 
on june 8 in vienna 
saudi arabia is the leading opec member state and sits on more 
than a quarter of the worlds oil proven reserves 
separately a report issued by the saudi arabian monetary 
agency the kingdoms equivalent of a central bank showed the oil 
sectors contribution to the gross national product had dropped 
from 55 percent a decade ago to 30 percent last year 
the report said that this affirmed the success of the kingdoms 
efforts to diversify its economy away from dependence on crude oil 
exports 
the private sectors share in the gnp rose from 30 percent 10 
years ago to 49 percent in 1987 while nonpetroleum exports 
increased from 315 million to 21 billion in 1987 the report 
said 
dependence on imports dropped from 70 percent of total demand 10 
years ago to 43 percent last year it said 
the main saudi exports are petrochemicals but the kingdom also 
is developing an agricultural base and has begun exporting produce 
to other countries 
the report said petrochemicals contributed 11 percent to gnp and 
agriculture 7 percent last year compared with 65 percent and 3 
percent a decade ago respectively

world champions in recycling the thrifty swiss 
are collecting more valuable waste than they can handle 
symbols of the nations steadily rising drive to reuse can be 
seen on most any street neatly tied bundles of old newspapers and 
bags of used clothes are regularly piled on sidewalks for 
collection consumers dump used glass in a nationwide network of 
blue steel containers often located at supermarkets 
tossing in a shopping bags worth of bottles has become 
practically second nature for the beer and wineloving swiss 
one geneva foreign resident recounts he once put down a load of 
empty bottles while briefly returning to his car meanwhile a man 
who happened to walk past dropped them into a nearby container 
why do the swiss save things that others more often consider 
garbage environmental concerns a tradition of selfsufficiency in 
a small landlocked country with few natural resources and a highly 
developed transport network are some explanations 
the swiss are becoming increasingly environmentconscious 
said albert weiss director of vetrorecycling switzerlands sole 
glass bottle recycler the company commends an intelligent and 
disciplined population 
most bottles carry deposits usually 50 centimes or about 35 
cents and are returned to bottling plants via stores to combat 
the rising mountain of household garbage the swiss milk industry 
will replace cardboard cartons with oldfashioned returnable 
bottles for a sixmonth trial this fall 
nonreturn bottles usually land in recycling containers to 
which virtually all of switzerlands 65 million people have easy 
access most separate colors into green brown and transparent 
about threequarters of all glass bottles and jars in 
switzerland are recycled last year 140000 metric tons were 
brought back up 53 percent from 1981 
we motivated consumers from the start by paying local 
communities for old glass 8 million swiss francs about 57 
million a year and publishing collection results weiss says 
of a program launched in 1972 
but the swiss who also consume french wine and german beer 
have an annual glass surplus pile of several thousand tons last 
month the first swiss factory turning powdered old glass into 
insulating foam began operation 
on another front local activists have launched collection 
drives for bottles made from a new type of plastic that can be 
reprocessed into foil or fibers 
old clothes find a new life too at least twice yearly all 
swiss household receive colored plastic bags with an appeal to 
donate used jackets dresses socks and shoes that are clean and 
wearable 
some 15000 tons were collected last year and one third was 
shipped to less developed countries most of the rest is sold 
secondhand or recycled into yarn and for example dishrags 
no other european country is as organized and intensive 
said beat alder head of texaid which coordinates six of the nine 
collection organizations 
paper is reused again and again in this country where 
supermarket grocery bags cost 14 cents each 
some 553000 tons of used paper and cardboard were retrieved 
last year swiss industry didnt need it all despite using the 
highest proportion of recycled paper in the world 44 percent 
exports generally to neighboring countries rose 18 percent 
thriftiness and social welfare are combined by the state 
telecommunications monopoly ptt which sells old telephone books 
brought back by customers to recyclers the proceeds bought 455 
radios and televisions for the handicapped and elderly last year 
aluminum recycling is not big in switzerland mainly because few 
drinks are sold in cans and too little is collected for economical 
reuse said hanspeter fahrni of the federal environmental 
protection office 
but meanwhile old engine oil is used in the cement industry 
the town of moudon has a factory that turns household waste into 
construction bricks and more than half of all garbage is burned at 
plants that generate heat for swiss homes

beechnut nutrition corp paid a 250000 
state fine for selling and advertising apple juice for babies that 
was actually appleflavored sugar water state officials said 
monday 
beechnut based in fort washington pa and two of its 
executives were named in november 1986 federal indictments for 
shipping 5 million jars of misbranded and adulterated apple juice 
for babies between 1978 and 1983 
the product was actually made from synthetic concentrate and 
contained little or no apple juice authorities discovered 
the juice had been bottled at the firms canajoharie plant in 
central new york 
in addition to the federal charges beechnut also faced charges 
of violating the states agriculture and markets law the state 
case against beechnut was closed with payment of the fine state 
attorney general robert abrams said 
the magitude of the penalty sends a clear message to the food 
processing industry that false labeling is a serious offense 
especially when the product is food intended for babies and young 
children he said 
a telephone recording at beechnut headquarters said all offices 
were closed monday 
beechnut pleaded guilty last fall to 215 counts of violating 
federal food and drug laws and agreed to pay a 2 million fine 
in february two of beechnuts former executives were convicted 
on hundreds of violations of federal food and drug laws along with 
conspiracy and mail fraud charges 
two beechnut employees had testified for the prosecution that 
they repeatedly warned executives that the concentrate was phony 
the company claimed that the fault remained with the supplier of 
the apple juice concentrate 
there were no allegations that the juice caused any health 
problems 
in may 1987 beechnut a subsidiary of nestle inc settled a 
classaction suit that was filed in federal court in philadelphia 
in response to the brooklyn indictment 
in that case the company agreed to set up a 5 million cash 
fund for consumers and to provide 25 million in beechnut and 
affiliated products to retailers

italian financier who headed an outlawed masonic lodge his aide 
umberto ortolani italian financier anna bonomi bolchini and 25

us treasury secretary james baker said 
monday the third world debt crisis must be treated as a economic 
problem rather than a political one with each countrys case 
handled individually 
the debt question cannot be regulated in a global manner 
baker told reporters after meeting with senegalese president abdou 
diouf debt structures are not the same from one country to 
another

international cooperation he pointed to senegal as a country that 
has achieved a certain level of credibility through its economic 
development and recent successes in controling its budget deficit 
baker is scheduled to leave tuesday for the ivory coast where 
he is expected to deliver an address on the third world debt 
problem to the board of governors of the african development bank 
baker praised senegals multiparty political system saying the 
country had passed an important test during the february elections 
which returned diouf to a second elected term and retained the 
ruling socialist partys majority in the national assembly 
opponents claimed dioufs party rigged votes to win reelection 
the government imposed a state of emergency on the dakar region 
after three days of severe rioting in the city the state of 
emergency was lifted may 17
