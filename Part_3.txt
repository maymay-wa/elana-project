3. Characteristics Comparison
----------------------------------------------------------------------
HIGH FREQUENCY TERMS (Top 10):
- These are mostly common English words (stop words) like 'the', 'a', 'of'
- They appear in almost every document (80-99% of documents)
- They don't carry much meaning for search because they're so common
- These words are usually removed in real search engines (stop word removal)
- Examples: articles (the, a), prepositions (of, in, to), pronouns (he, it)

LOW FREQUENCY TERMS (Bottom 10):
- These are very specific or rare words
- They appear in only 1 document each
- Could be: proper names, technical terms, typos, or very specialized words
- These are very discriminative - if you search for them, you find specific docs
- Good for precise searches but not useful for general queries
