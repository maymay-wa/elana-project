grain elevator complex friday killing at least two people 
injuring three others and leveling four grain silos and an office 
building authorities said 
three more people were reported missing at the adm growmark 
complex along the des plaines river about 40 miles southwest of 
chicago said lynn behringer a spokeswoman for the will county 
emergency services and disaster agency 
officials on the scene confirmed that two people died and at 
least three others were injured ms behringer added 
it shook this building like a truck or something had hit the 
back of this building said john vanderlinden a worker at nearby 
stonitsch construction co it was quite a big explosion 
authorities suspect grain dust may have caused the first 
explosion about 11 am which ruptured a natural gas main and 
touched off a second blast moments later said fire chief george 
plese granaries pose an explosion risk because of highly flammable 
grain dust 
the explosions leveled the complexs 100feet tall concrete 
silos which hold a total of about 100000 bushels said dick 
burket a spokesman for the granary 
initial reports said six silos were destroyed but david 
munchalfen a security guard at the facility said there had been 
four silos at the site and only a sheetmetal covered grain dryer 
remained standing one silo crushed the adjacent onestory office 
building 
its gone totaled level complete just like dynamite 
said bob butterfield 64 a wilmington farmer who said he saw metal 
and concrete flying through the air after the blast 
i ran about 30 feet when i fell and rolled it just came down 
in a big pile said butterfield who witnessed the blast while he 
was leaving the complex after unloading a truckload of grain 
rescue workers used dogs bulldozers and a crane to search for 
two people believed missing in a 25foothigh pile of concrete 
chunks and twisted steel mixed with corn and soybeans authorities 
said 
disaster officials also sent four boats to search the river 
after a witness reported seeing a third person fall off a barge 
nearby ms behringer said 
the explosion shattered windows in homes east of the elevator 
complex and sprayed grain and rubble burying a tractortrailer rig 
the adm growmark elevator is a joint venture between 
decaturbased archer daniels midland co and bloomingtonbased 
growmark a regional cooperative that sells farm supplies and 
markets grain 
adm spokesman dick burket in decatur said the complex receives 
grain hauled by truck and transfers it to river barges 
the illinois accident brought to five the number of people 
killed in elevator explosions so far this year in the united 
states said juan gomez of the us agriculture department

there once was a time when people could sit 
in the bar of the old hotel del prado and enjoy looking at diego 
riveras mural dream of a sunday afternoon in alameda park 
the once elegant hotel is now an earthquakedamaged hulk waiting 
to be demolished and the mural is in its own museum pavilion 
across the street 
the delicate transfer of the mural has been completed it 
escaped damage in the sept 19 1985 earthquake that killed 
thousands and devastated large parts of the city 
the famous mural is open to the public again like a window 
opened on mexicos rich history it shows figures from the mexican 
political and art worlds and from daily life all on parade in the 
park 
an explanation at the entrance to the new museum says the 
decision was made to transfer the mural from the hotel after the 
extent of the damage there became clear 
it should be linked to the alameda for having been painted on 
that theme and for the place itself the plaque from the national 
fine arts institute says 
the alameda the downtown park across the street and down a 
block from the murals old home also was expanded through 
earthquake reconstruction programs a solidarity garden 
recalling the victims of the 1985 disaster was built on the site of 
the cleared adjoining block that once held a department store and 
the hotel regis 
the murals pavilion is built on the site of the hotels parking 
garage which was badly damaged and demolished after the quake 
the fine arts institute said that no room could be found in any 
of its buildings close to the alameda because of the colossal 
dimensions of the work thats why it was decided to take 
advantage of the possibility of constructing an appropriate 
building 
in place of the old hotels comfortable cocktail lounge viewers 
now can sit on three simple benches placed in front of the mural or 
just stand for a while in the large but sparsely decorated room 
diagrams with keyed numbers on the outline of each figure tell 
who 73 of the people shown in the mural are 
among the figures is a fat boy with large eyes and a round face 
a selfportrait something rivera often put in his works 
in the foreground is spanish conqueror hernando cortes on a 
park bench an elderly man dreams of president antonio lopez de 
santa anna giving american gen william scott the keys to texas 
new mexico arizona california nevada and other lands that once 
belonged to mexico 
farther back a former military man now poor dreams of the 
emperors maximilian and carlota a drunken tramp next to an old 
woman dreams with his mouth open of miltiary glories at the side 
of benito juarez who holds the reform laws he put into effect as 
mexicos great 19th century president 
near the center is dictator porfirio diaz and his wife carmen 
romero rubio diaz appears full of his fame and power with a chest 
full of ribbons on his uniform 
at the right a street vendor offers typical mexican food to a 
middleclass youth and three students who dream of gen victoriano 
huerta official history says huerta had francisco i madero who 
started the 191021 mexican revolution killed 
rivera completed the 49 foot by 13 foot painting for the then 
fashionable del prado in 1948 
along with david alfaro siqueiros and jose clemente orozco 
rivera was one of mexicos three great muralists and one of the 
most important latin american painters in the art world he died in 
1957 
among his other best known murals are those in the national 
palace of the spanish conquest the mexican revolution and other 
events from the countrys history 
the composition is memories of my life of my childhood and my 
youth from 1895 to 1910 rivera wrote after finishing the mural 
i do not believe that this work has alarmed or can alarm anyone 
the contemporary figures in the fresco as figures in dreams are 
not portraits 
it was an apparent reference to the phrase god does not 
exist a quote attributed to juarez adviser ignacio ramirez and 
written on a piece of paper by ramirez in the mural 
eight years after the mural was completed rivera changed the 
paper to read conference in the academy of letran the year 
1836 the phrase refers to the date and place where ramirez made 
his controversial comment

massachusetts first step towards universal health 
care insurance may be a first step towards a national health care 
plan says gov michael s dukakis 
what we do here today can and must be done all over the united 
states the democratic presidential frontrunner said thursday 
signing the nations first law to make health insurance available 
to all bay staters by 1992 
we have made a great start he told about 2000 supporters 
crowded onto the statehouse steps for the signing ceremony now 
we must make it work and then we must carry the message of health 
care for all across all this country 
dukakis said universal health care was under discussion in 
massachusetts for nearly two years before it passed the 
legislature it has been 40 years since harry s truman proposed it 
for the nation 
as an american i dont want my country to stand alone with 
south africa as the only two industrialized nations that do not 
provide basic health security for their citizens dukakis said 
dukakis supports a bill by sen edward kennedy dmass calling 
for minimum health care guarantees as the first step towards 
providing health insurance to all americans said dukakis 
campaign spokesman steve akey 
the governor also supports states taking their own initiative to 
offer universal health care statehouse press secretary james 
dorsey said 
the massachusetts bill was the outcome of a ninemonth 
legislative struggle and comes two years after massachusetts voters 
voted 21 for a nonbinding referendum urging congress to enact a 
national health care program 
dr david u himmelstein of harvard medical school spokesman 
for physicians for a national health program called the health 
care bill a first step but a bandaid approach when major surgery 
is needed 
on wednesday dukakis estimated that the laws cost to taxpayers 
would be 6452 million through fiscal 1992 less about 225 
million in projected costcutting in medicaid other estimates put 
the cost to the state government in the next four years as high as 
12 billion 
the law would provide coverage to about 600000 massachusetts 
residents under age 65 currently without health insurance or 
roughly one of every 10 people in the commonwealth 
this would be done in stages and through a variety of 
approaches from extending medicaid benefits for disabled adults 
and children to statebrokered pooled insurance for small 
businesses and individuals 
by 1992 all employers with more than five fulltime employees 
must offer health insurance coverage or pay an unemployment 
surcharge to help the state provide this coverage to the uninsured 
under the proposal the state also would take control of a 300 
millionayear pool for indigents that is funded from hospital 
surcharges on the insured 
senate ways and means chairman patricia mcgovern who proposed 
the idea of universal health care in massachusetts more than a year 
ago acknowledged that risks were involved in the undertaking 
in the end i think we regret what we have never done not 
what weve tried and weve failed but what weve never tried she 
said this whole effort is about the ability to take a risk

the kuwait airways hijack has spawned plenty of 
proposals from governments antiterrorism experts and the public 
on how to tackle air piracy but each idea invariably contains a 
serious pitfall 
they range from a west german lawmakers suggestion that 
knockout gas be pumped into hijacked planes to the international 
air transport associations call for an international brigade to 
fight terrorism 
the hijack drama which ended in algiers on wednesday left a 
bittersweet taste around europe where it unfolded daily through 
live tv broadcasts the anguish and frustration it engendered was 
reflected in calls to radio talkshows and letters to newspapers 
proposing various antihijack strategies 
there was rejoicing that the ordeal ended peacefully and that 
kuwait apparently stood firm against demands for the release of 17 
jailed proiranian terrorists 
experts noted that hijackings have fallen from 95 in 1969 to 
fewer than 20 a year in the 1980s they also pointed to the 
difficulty the hijackers had in landing the kuwaiti jumbo jet 
saying it showed that the refusal of airports to deal with air 
pirates is almost universal 
but there was outrage that the nine hijackers having killed two 
passengers and put others through a horrifying ordeal apparently 
escaped unpunished 
at the risk of sounding churlish the ending of one of the 
longest hijackings in aviation history is not an occasion for 
unrestrained rejoicing commented the independent a london 
newspaper 
experts say the biggest problem is airport security some 
airports are extremely strict such as in tel aviv where departing 
passengers are interrogated while others are dangerously lax 
paul sheppard security chief at the international civil 
aviation organization likens security to a great spider web over 
the whole world and theres no way of plugging up every single 
gap the chain of security is only as strong as its weakest link 
authorities in bangkok where the airliner was parked before the 
hijacking say guns could have been smuggled aboard before the 
plane reached thailand but they are investigating suspicions that 
thai catering staff were bribed into helping the hijackers 
ground staff are very poorly paid in third world countries 
says ian geldard of the institute for the study of terrorism 
and if people there can be bribed hijackers are going to go 
for third world countries 
one measure proposed by geldards london institute is to store 
passengers passports in the baggage hold thus making it difficult 
for hijackers to identify hostages for execution by nationality 
the israeli newspaper maariv reported that a california rabbi 
was in tel aviv selling a hijack survival kit containing a false 
passport id and credit card to israelis who have good reason to 
conceal their identities from hijackers maariv said the kit costs 
a hefty 165 
richard clutterbuck an english antiterrorism expert proposes 
issuing a fingerprinted clearance card entitling bona fide 
passengers to clear airports speedily while those with no card 
would be searched 
but geldard says the system wont work because states that 
sponsor terrorism will have little trouble obtaining the clearance 
cards 
west german lawmaker johannes gerster suggests a gas to put 
the hijackers and the passengers to sleep lightningquick the 
danger some experts say is that if the gas failed to work 
instantly it would leave the hijackers enough time to detonate 
explosives 
clutterbuck says sophisticated machinery is being developed to 
detect explosives thermally or by neutron bombardment but the 
problem he acknowledged in an interview is that it is expensive 
the genevabased international air transport association 
representing 168 airlines in 114 countries proposes new 
international courts to try hijackers and an international commando 
brigade 
but geldard called this a utopian dream saying in an 
interview its difficult enough to get collaboration even with 
firmest allies in a lot of countries the different intelligence 
agencies dont even cooperate among themselves 
iata spokesman david kyd recalled the 1978 summit at which the 
seven leading industrial democracies threatened sanctions against 
countries that fail to bring hijackers to justice 
the threat has only once been implemented against afghanistan 
he told british broadcasting corp radio adding one wonders why 
it hasnt been applied more often 
clutterbuck said in a perfect world it would of course have 
been far better if the hijackers hadnt been released but i think 
that would have been too much to expect 
but kyd said that by releasing the hijackers algeria had set 
itself up as a soft touch for terrorists he said hijackers 
should be punished whatever that takes if it means prolonging 
the suffering of other hostages aboard an aircraft then so be it

denmarks move to bolster its ban on 
visiting nucleararmed warships has focused attention on a nato 
ally that already suffers from a reputation as an unreliable 
comradeinarms 
nato long has complained that denmark does not pull its weight 
in the north atlantic treaty organization its annual defense 
spending 22 percent of its gross national product in 1987 is 
the lowest of natos european members except for greece and italy 
for 31 years denmark has had a general policy banning nuclear 
arms from its soil in peacetime until now danish officials took 
the position of assuming that visiting warships would obey 
last week parliament voted to demand that warships be told they 
cannot carry nuclear arms into danish ports 
at nato headquarters here officials say the measure if 
implemented would render natos reinforcement strategy for denmark 
useless 
the measure led danish prime minister poul schlueters minority 
government to call for early elections may 10 
the centerright government opposes the nucleararmed warship 
measure and maintains danes remain loyal to nato 
one danish nato official said that in a marriage it behooves 
either partner not to be confrontational 
we should not exaggerate the situation but accept there are 
differences of opinion within nato said the official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
such comments do little to calm the nerves of nato officials 
whose primary concern is to maintain an ironclad consensus about 
defense notably nuclear arms 
nato members norway and spain both prohibit the stationing of 
nuclear arms on their soil during peacetime but neither requires 
visiting nato warships to declare whether they are carrying such 
arms 
in 1984 the united states and britain broke off military 
cooperation with new zealand after that country began insisting 
that warships say whether or not they carry nuclear weapons 
we know that in some cases allied warships carried nuclear 
arms into our ports said the danish official this of course 
was not allowed but we closed one eye said the danish official 
to tell visiting warships they cannot carry nuclear arms into 
danish ports would said nato secretary general lord carrington 
run counter to the basis of nato strategy and the principles of 
shared burdens and benefits of alliance membership 
the united states and britain which would rush to denmarks aid 
in times of crisis with troops and materiel have a policy of never 
saying whether their warships have nuclear arms 
a us nato official said this week that the stricter 
antinuclear stand if taken to its logical conclusion would mean 
nato allies cannot reinforce denmark during a crisis before the 
outbreak of war 
failure to reinforce natos chokepoint on the soviet unions 
baltic fleet would affect not just denmark but also neighboring 
west germany 
its clear this is not a danishamerican or danishbritish 
problem but a matter for all of the alliance said a senior west 
german nato source also speaking privately 
the controversy led nato to move next weeks nato defense 
ministers meeting from denmark to brussels the meeting will focus 
on nuclear defense issues 
in 1985 mchael hesseltine then british defense secretary 
warned danes not to expect british soldiers to come to their aid if 
they dont do more for their own defense 
last march danish lt gen poul thorsen natos top commander 
for the baltic approaches resigned and said he could no longer 
represent denmark in a reasonable manner he said danish 
defense was being maltreated through gross underfinancing

the hollywood scriptwriters strike has cost 
their industry more than 15 million producers say blaming much 
of the loss to production halts on such hit series as the cosby 
show and la law 
directors actors production crew workers and secretaries were 
among thos hit by the writers guild of america strike herb 
steinberg a spokesman for the alliance of motion picture and 
television producers said thursday 
he said about 1400 employees who work in production areas other 
than writing have been laid off as a result of the sevenweekold 
strike 
the 9000member guild went on strike march 7 over issues of 
residuals from movies and television shows distributed in foreign 
countries and a producers proposal to restructure residual 
payments for hourlong television shows sold into syndication 
we have no way of verifying the information they put out 
said guild spokeswoman cheryl rhoden however we do question 
whether they have taken into consideration the normal seasonal 
layoffs that have occurred because of the television season 
hiatus 
steinberg said the layoffs and costs tabulated by the producers 
were chiefly from 22 regular season television episodes from shows 
such as la law and the cosby show which were not 
produced because of lack of scripts 
this has nothing whatsoever to do with the seasonal layoffs 
said steinberg it has nothing to do with the hiatus 
two federally mediated sessions on april 18 and march 14 ended 
without resumption of negotiations no new talks are scheduled 
the strike curtailed the seasons of several television shows and 
could threaten the start of the fall television season if it 
continues into the summer 
according to statistics gathered by the alliance a bargaining 
organization of more than 200 studios and producers the strike 
thus far has cost 1062 cast and crew members an estimated 127 
million in salaries and benefits 
some 210 secretaries and other officer staffers have been laid 
off as a result of the strike and lost an estimated 756000 in 
salaries the strike also has affected 207 socalled writer 
hyphenates who have lost fees salaries and benefits worth an 
estimated 22 million 
a writer hyphenate is generally a writerproducer someone who 
is developing a television show or movie because they are on 
strike as writers they cannot advance work on scripts or ideas 
steinberg said the alliances analysis concludes that 45000 
persondays have been lost as a result of the strike 
if the alliance wants to see a speedy end to the strike the 
best way to assure that would be to return to the table and 
continue a dialogue that can resolve the outstanding issues ms 
rhoden said 
steinberg said the last 20minute meeting between the new sides 
had been requested by the writers but the union had no new offers

democratic frontrunner michael s dukakis is 
getting loads of advice on where to turn for a running mate with 
many party leaders urging him to avoid jesse jackson and turn to a 
southern senator 
but the massachusetts governor indicated thursday he wants 
maximum breathing room as he searches for someone to fill the no 2 
spot on the democratic ticket 
obviously you look at regions where you could use some help 
said former gov charles robb of virginia the south and west are 
the regions you also look at a philosophical segment where you 
could use some shoring up and i guess that would be with moderate 
conservative voters 
robb who had urged sen sam nunn of georgia to run for 
president said he would like to see nunn as the vice presidential 
candidate but only if the senator were offered the opportunity to 
serve as secretary of defense at the same time 
party chairman paul g kirk jr predicted that the vice 
presidential nominee would be a senator from the south or 
southwest 
i wouldnt make that judgment at all dukakis said in an 
interview with the associated press 
he also rejected suggestions that if jackson finishes second in 
the race for the presidential nomination he ought to be given the 
no 2 spot on the ticket 
if i were to finish second it wouldnt entitle me to anything 
more than consideration period dukakis said 
the discussion of potential dukakis running mates began to 
intensify after the massachusetts governors strong victory in the 
new york primary established him as the likely democratic 
presidential nominee 
i have spent literally zero time thinking about it and i will 
not unless and until i have either won the nomination or it looks 
as if its pretty well in hand dukakis insisted 
if that happens then i will begin what i hope will be a 
thoughtful and thorough process of selecting a running mate but 
im not going to do anything on that quite literally until the 
california and new jersey primaries are over 
dukakis said the paramount concern in choosing a running mate 
ought to be a candidates ability to serve as a firstrate 
president if god forbid something happened to the president 
all else pales by comparison he said 
the massachusetts governor who has been faulted in the campaign 
for his lack of experience in foreign affairs disputed the view 
that he needs to select a running mate with experience in 
international issues 
you pick a secretary of state to be your key foreign policy 
adviser and a national security adviser and secretary of 
defense he said adding that you dont necessarily need 
another secretary of state as vice president 
there were mixed opinions on the value of jesse jackson as a 
running mate 
robb said jackson doesnt fill in the kind of strengths he 
dukakis needs 
both dukakis and jackson on the ticket together is not the 
best political decision you can make said robert g beckel 
campaign manager for walter f mondale when he was the democratic 
presidential nominee in 1984 
i think everybody fully expects to see a southerner this 
time said al lapierre executive director of the alabama 
democratic party 
he said jackson on the ticket would hurt dukakis because there 
still are many people who will not accept a black 
the sad part is not voting for him because of disagreement on 
issues or lack of experience in government thats ok thats what 
politics is all about the race thing you hate to say it but its 
there 
at a news conference wednesday jackson said i need his 
dukakis support base to win he needs my support base to win 
together we can win 
asked if he were talking about a dukakisjackson ticket the 
candidate said no its just the challenge we have to pull 
together our constituencies 
hes not running for vice president and i didnt sign on with 
him for vice president willie brown the national chairman of 
jacksons campaign and the speaker of the california assembly said 
thursday 
but brown said i think a dukakisjackson ticket would be 
good i think a jacksondukakis would be the best for the 
democrats 
i think jackson has worked hard and perhaps earned it if he 
wants it said fred brown a democratic national committee member 
from coffeyville kan 
it doesnt bother me if a black is on the ticket he added 
people want to win

what do michael jackson and the orioles have in 
common both wear a glove for no apparent reason 
thats one of the jokes making the rounds about the winless team 
thats also known as the zeros 
fans of the baltimore orioles are laughing on the outside but 
crying on the inside as they watch their team soar like a stone 
they need to get psychotherapy banker mark swensen of 
baltimore said thursday im not going to watch the games until 
they start winning i cant handle it i get nauseous 
wednesdays loss to the milwaukee brewers gave the orioles the 
dubious distinction of being the first major league team in history 
to lose 14 games at the start of the season they continued their 
losing ways thursday falling 71 to the brewers in milwaukee 
but fans in birdland say it will take more than a string of 
losses to kill the pride they have in the team that won the world 
series five years ago and six pennants from 1966 to 1983 
i think theyre the best said chris slowinski 28 a sales 
representative for a beer company people around here are bird 
fanatics its embarrassing because there is a winning tradition 
here in baltimore i have season tickets i go to the games 
expecting them to win 
disc jockey bob rivers who vowed to stay on the air at wiyyfm 
until the orioles break the skid was a trifle grouchy thursday 
after broadcasting for more than 58 hours he has napped briefly 
between music sets since tuesday 
im a little irritable im a little cranky i can see the 
bags under my eyes he said but im holding up my commitment 
patty waters an administrative assistant in the orioles public 
relations office said the telephones have been ringing off the 
hook as fans called to offer encouragement and suggestions 
one lady wanted to hold a mass positive thinking seminar for 
the fans and the club ms waters said one lady recommended 
hypnosis she said if she hypnotized all of them and let them know 
how good they are the streak would end 
we have a group of letters from a local school i dont know 
if the teacher was making fun of us but the kids letters 
suggested the players chew gum and stick it on the end of their 
bats to help make contact or put it in their gloves so they might 
catch a ball ms waters said 
a regular caller to her office this week has been baltimore joe 
a new york man who changed his name to reflect his affection for 
the city 
hes calling to say hi hes apparently taking a lot of 
ribbing from friends who support the yankees ms waters said 
chuck litty 42 a lifelong fan and member of the orioles 
advocates a baseball promotion and volunteer civic organization in 
baltimore figures the odds are with the team at this point 
besides the fact that theyre playing bad theyre snakebit 
litty said as each game progresses the more these guys are 
putting pressure upon themselves once they get this victory and 
i know they will get it maybe things will straighten out and they 
will become a competitive team 
i cant understand it i know this is a better ballclub than 
what were showing weve had a long history of being a successful 
ballclub im just dealing with it day to day and hoping they break 
out of it

democrat albert gore jr made his exit from 
the 1988 presidential race with this succinct analysis of his 
debtburdened bid i was doing great until i turned 40 
gores departure thursday narrowed the democratic presidential 
race down to two frontrunner michael dukakis and jesse jackson 
it was forced by gores failure to score a breakthrough in any 
state of the north ending with new york on tuesday 
the tennessee senator ran much of his campaign burdened by the 
notion that at age 39 he was too young and expressed relief upon 
turning 40 at the end of march 
but by then the high point of his campaign had come and gone 
the super tuesday contests six weeks ago when he won five southern 
primaries 
he never fared better than a 17 percent showing in wisconsin 
after that 
things didnt work out exactly the way i had planned gore 
flanked by his wife parents and children told supporters jammed 
into a senate office building 
i lost this race and that is a disappointment gore said 
but some things matter to me more than winning helping my 
party serving my country knowing when to keep fighting and 
knowing when ive been licked 
gore technically left his campaign in a suspended state while 
acknowledging he wouldnt be the nominee or campaign any more gore 
maintains a candidacy that permits all his delegates to attend the 
democratic national convention 
gore amassed 423 democratic national convention delegates during 
his campaign according to the associated press count under party 
rules delegate slots he has already won but for which people have 
not yet been chosen could have been awarded to other candidates 
had he not remained technically a candidate 
jackson would have gained 34 of gores delegates immediately 
while dukakis would have gotten 29 illinois sen paul simons 
decision to suspend his campaign denied jackson another 47 
delegates he would have inherited in this manner 
gore said he spoke with both dukakis and jackson and that both 
were comfortable with his decision to hold onto the delegates 
since neither would have gained significantly he said the move 
would protect democratic leaders who backed him in states where 
delegates had not yet been chosen naming georgia as an example 
he said he planned no endorsement and repeated his oftstated 
contention that he has no interest in the vice presidential 
nomination though he left that door open 
im not trying in any way to broker a convention that is not 
going to be brokered anyway he said 
in departing gore delivered some of the most eloquent lines of 
his campaign he offered praise for his democratic opponents during 
the long campaign saying that each had taught him something 
jackson he said taught him that a successful president must 
be both a chief executive and a preacher it was a line that 
recalled the criticism he leveled at jackson in new york two weeks 
ago when gore said the nation was choosing a president not a 
preacher 
he excoriated president reagan and vice president george bush 
saying they had brought the most selfish generation of 
leadership in american history 
we have been subjected for eight years to a man who quotes our 
heroes against us he said but franklin d roosevelt does not 
belong to a man who does not even see the homeless on our streets 
he promised support for the eventual democratic nominee 
i want no part of a stopjackson or a stopdukakis movement 
gore said the only man i want to stop is george bush

for awhile holly lavalla and daniel morelli 
thought about what they could do with their 13615 refund check 
from the internal revenue service unhappily they decided to send 
it back 
when its that big you send it back because you know theyll 
hunt this down lavalla told the times of beverly its a very 
very tempting thing when you look at five digits with your name 
on the check 
however she added i need a couple more zeroes to hide all 
that guilt 
their check for 13615 more than 25 times the approximately 
500 refund they expected was nearly half of the couples combined 
yearly income 
whattaya mean were going to send it back lavalla a 
hospital worker recalled her husband saying but she replied 
lets get back to earth now dan 
the couples attorney informed internal revenue service 
officials of the check which was returned thursday 
after she told them the amount of my check there was a very 
loooong pause said lavalla they were flabbergasted by the 
amount 
anita castro spokeswoman for the irs service center in andover 
said the the refund check is kind of extreme thats not the 
norm she added it could be a keypunch error but its got to 
be more than that 
she declined to comment further until she has reviewed the case

beer and liquor producers say requiring 
alcoholic beverage containers to carry health warning labels will 
do little to solve problems of abuse 
labels are not education and they dont really help solve the 
problem of abuse jim sanders president of the beer institute 
said thursday we think its really a false solution to a real 
problem 
he called legislation to require such labels an emotional 
overreaction 
earlier a bipartisan group of house and senate lawmakers held a 
news conference to outline their labeling legislation 
the most harmful drug in america is alcohol said sen strom 
thurmond rsc 
thurmond who introduced his bill in february said alcohol 
abuse costs the us economy about 120 billion a year including 
increased medical expenses and lost productivity alcoholrelated 
traffic accidents claim 18000 lives each year he added 
its a very rare family in this country today that has not 
been hit by some of the ravages of alcoholism one way or another 
said sen john glenn dohio a cosponsor of the bill 
glenn chairman of the senate governmental affairs committee 
said the panel has scheduled a series of hearings on the alcohol 
problem 
the legislation would require the placement of one of five 
alternating labels on each alcoholic beverage container 
rep john conyers dmich who introduced the house version of 
the bill thursday said the labels would warn about the dangers of 
drinking and driving of drinking while pregnant and of combining 
alcohol with other drugs 
in addition the labels would say that alcohol may be addictive 
and that its consumption can increase the risk of developing 
hypertension liver disease and cancer 
susan sullivan an actress on the television series falcon 
crest said her father was an alcoholic but that he would have 
wanted his children to know the dangers of alcohol 
it seems to me incredible that we do not have these warning 
labels on alcohol bottles when it is such a dangerous drug said 
ms sullivan 
christine lubinski washington representative for the national 
council on alcoholism said the primary source of alcohol 
information available to the american public comes from 2 billion 
in advertising aimed at depicting alcohol as a glamorous magic 
potion 
ms lubinski said the warning labels will institutionalize 
public health messages about the risks associated with alcohol 
consumption 
but janet flynn spokeswoman for the distilled spirits council 
of the united states said the group opposes warning labels 
we believe that the warning labels for alcohol beverage 
containers are unnecessary said ms flynn and they are 
unnecessary because the claims concerning the risks of alcohol 
consumption are well known

f16 fighter jets swooshed across the 
sky and paratroopers performed precision jumps as israel displayed 
its military might in a 40th independence day celebration marred by 
the palestinian uprising 
foreign minister shimon peres visited troops in the occupied 
west bank town of bethlehem and called for restraint in quelling 
arab protests in the occupied lands saying excessive force would 
only radicalize palestinians 
if we act with restraint they the arabs will realize that 
violence leads them nowhere and they will have to look for a 
solution and were ready to talk about a solution said peres 
head of the centerleft labor party 
but prime minister yitzhak shamir peres political rival took 
a hard stand saying the arab side is still not ready for 
peace 
shamir head of the rightwing likud bloc told israel radio 
that peace talks shouldnt take place under the threat of 
stonethrowing and violence 
the fundamentalist moslem brotherhood which has growing support 
in the territories issued an underground booklet calling for a 
steppedup struggle against israel 
our style of resistance is according to what god told us kill 
them wherever you find them this is the solution for those who 
follow the koran the moslem holy book the booklet said 
few clashes were reported thursday in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip the lands israel captured from egypt and jordan in the 
1967 arabisraeli war 
general strikes paralyzed towns and cities thursday in the 
occupied lands where about 400000 arabs nearly a third of the 
population there remained under curfew for a fifth day 
for a second day the army closed israel to arab residents of 
the occupied lands the security measure for independence day was 
to remain in effect until after moslem prayers today 
journalists were barred from most parts of the west bank and 
gaza 
in the arab village of isawiya north of jerusalem police fired 
rubber bullets at palestinians who threw stones and raised black 
flags to mourn slain palestine liberation organization military 
commander khalil wazir 
new details emerged about saturdays assassination of wazir who 
was gunned down at his home in a suburb of the tunisian capital 
tunis 
a tunisian report said the job was done by an elite israeli 
commando squad and israeli sources speaking privately to the 
associated press agreed 
the israeli sources also have told the ap that the team operated 
under the direct command of chief of staff lt gen dan shomron and 
stole documents during the raid at wazirs home 
the sources said the government approved the operation on two 
previous occasions in recent weeks but canceled it at the last 
minute for technical reasons 
israels government has refused comment and shamir said 
thursday i dont think anyone has anything to say about this 
meanwhile israel topped off its independence day celebrations 
with a military show watched by about 40000 people at ramat gan 
stadium near tel aviv and broadcast live on television 
fighter planes spewing blueandwhite steam the flag colors 
flew loops and circled in formations spelling the numeral 40 
usmade f16s crossed the sky and paratroopers in white 
jumpsuits performed precision freefall jumps from 45000 feet one 
waved an israeli flag as he glided toward the stadium floor 
we all love the army and our soldiers said yossi a police 
officer deployed at one of the stadium gates its a day that 
unites the country 
yossi who would not give his last name said the arab uprising 
dampened his joy adding we want to live in peace with the 
arabs but they are not ready to accept this 
since the dec 8 start of the antioccupation protests 169 
palestinians and two israelis have been killed 
israel stayed independent because it has been able to protect 
itself said one of the cheering spectators sheila schlussel 
50 of teaneck nj israel is getting a bad press because of 
what is happening in the territories we came here to express our 
support 
elsewhere israelis celebrated the anniversary with picnics 
hikes fireworks and the annual international bible quiz in which 
17yearold jeremy weider of monsey ny tied for first place 
as an independence day present to israel the united states 
signed the most comprehensive pact to date between the two 
countries formalizing economic and military agreements 
the agreement signed in jerusalem by shamir and us ambassador 
thomas pickering will be binding for future administrations 
this is the most friendly administration we have ever worked 
with said shamir they are determined that the strong 
friendship and cooperation will continue and even be strengthened 
despite the differences that crop up from time to time

the federal budget deficit grew more than 
expected in march but the cumulative red ink in the first six 
months of the fiscal year is still 35 percent smaller than a year 
ago the government says 
the treasury department said thursday that the march deficit was 
291 billion up from 239 billion in february and 27 percent 
larger than march 1987 economists had been predicting a monthly 
deficit of 24 billion to 26 billion 
michael evans head of an economic forecasting service in 
washington said some federal spending was probably deferred to 
march from february when outlays were somewhat smaller than 
expected 
analysts also said the budget imbalance is usually higher in 
march than in other months because people who owe taxes generally 
wait until april to pay while those due a refund normally file 
early 
for the first half of the 1988 fiscal year the government has 
run a deficit of 1189 billion 35 percent lower than the red ink 
incurred for the same period a year ago 
for the entire fiscal year which ends sept 30 the reagan 
administration is projecting a deficit of 1467 billion down 24 
percent from the 1504 billion deficit in 1987 
however the congressional budget office estimates the deficit 
will climb to 157 billion 
last year the deficit fell sharply because of an unexpected 28 
billion windfall in tax payments made by people who sold off 
longterm assets before the capital gains rates were increased 
under the new tax law 
some analysts say there could be a second smaller windfall this 
year if people end up owing more in taxes for 1987 than they would 
have under the old tax law 
april is the big question mark with the tax returns coming 
in evans said 
in march government revenue totaled 65 billion while spending 
totaled 941 billion for the first half of the year revenues 
total 4120 billion while spending amounted to 5309 billion 
as usual the largest spending categories in march were the 
military followed by social security interest on the national debt 
and other programs in the department of health and human services 
military spending totaled 258 billion last month and 1423 
billion for the fiscal year so far up 56 percent from the same 
period a year ago 
spending for social security totaled 184 billion last month 
and 1050 billion for the past six months up 56 percent from the 
same period in the 1987 fiscal year social security is exempted 
from budget limitations under the grammrudman law and is therefore 
generally showing faster spending increases than the other 
categories 
the other hhs programs including medicare and medicaid spent 
142 billion in march and 775 billion so far this budget year a 
59 percent increase over 1987 
interest on the 25 trillion national debt nearly one fifth 
of total government spending was 144 billion last month and 
1052 billion so far this fiscal year an increase of 96 percent 
over the same period last year

congressional permission to transfer 8 
million in energy department money from administration to the 
superconducting super collider avoids delays in the physics 
research project the department says 
most of the money will be used to prepare environmental impact 
statements on prospective sites phil keif energy department 
spokesman said thursday 
we have to go through that in order to select a site so it 
keeps us on schedule keif said had the transfer of money been 
rejected it just would have delayed things he said 
rep carl pursell rmich said the transfer was cleared by an 
agreement between house and senate subcommittee chairmen concerned 
with funding for the 44 billion project which physicists plan to 
use to study the basic structure of matter 
obviously this approval demonstrates a certain level of 
support for the project within the subcommittee leadership which 
as an advocate of the project im delighted to see said 
pursell a member of the house energy appropriations subcommittee 
requests to transfer money that has already been appropriated 
require the consent of the chairman and ranking minority member of 
the house and senate appropriations subcommittees handling the 
money the 8 million had been appropriated for the 1988 fiscal 
year 
the committees last month had denied the energy departments 
request to transfer the money amid substantial congressional 
opposition to the project 
seven states have been selected as potential sites for the super 
collider which will include a 53mileround particle accelerator 
the finalists are arizona colorado illinois michigan north 
carolina tennessee and texas 
president reagan has asked congress to approve 363 million for 
the project for fiscal 1989 although house supporters have said 
they would seek 100 million because of budgetbalancing concerns 
the project is expected to create 4000 permanent jobs and have 
an annual budget of 280 million

an american survivor of the 1943 escape 
from sobibor nazi death camp who has waged a lonely fight to have 
it preserved as a memorial returned this week and wept at the 
sound of israels national anthem 
thomas blatt surrounded by a small group of friends joined 
them in singing the hatikvah or the hope 
they stood next to the grasscovered mound of ashes and bones 
which likely contains the remains of both of blatts parents and of 
his little brother 
i could never imagine that i could stand here someday and hear 
singing of the hatikvah in this spot said blatt 60 of santa 
barbara calif 
i hope there is another world and that all the people from 
holland from france who also died at sobibor are listening 
too he said 
it was a day of vindication for blatt he was accompanied by a 
polish official who confirmed publicly that poland would replace an 
erroneous sign at the camps entrance which lists the 250000 
victims as soviet prisoners of war jews poles and gypsies 
here the victims were all jews said lee kagan president of 
the holocaust sites preservation committee founded by blatt 
blatt a polish jew was 15 when he arrived at sobibor in april 
1943 he watched as his mother father and brother were marched off 
to their deaths he was spared by the caprice of the camp 
commander who needed a shoeshine boy 
six months later blatt took part in the camps successful 
uprising in which most of the nazis were killed and 300 prisoners 
escaped about 50 of those escaped prisoners survived the war the 
story was the topic of a cbs television movie last year escape 
from sobibor 
blatt survived the war fighting with partisans against the 
germans and eventually emigrated to the united states he has 
revisited the camp many times and has repeatedly protested its 
unkempt condition and the misleading sign 
kagan thanked jacek wilczur a historian with polands main 
commission for the investigation of nazi war crimesinstitute of 
national remembrance for agreeing to change the inscription 
noting that sobibor was the site of the only successful mass 
uprising at a concentration camp kagan said 
we would like to thank you for restoring a page in jewish 
history there are still people who think jews went like sheep into 
places like this and its not true here at the site of their 
biggest revolt id like to thank you 
blatt obtained the promises from polish officials to correct the 
sign and make other improvements in a meeting last august 
when he returned to the camp wednesday he found flowers planted 
in front of the mound a fresh coat of paint along the borders and 
a glass exhibition case at the entrance showing an architects 
plans for the camp 
among the changes planned are fencing in the camp reshaping 
pathways erecting exhibits that would tell the story of sobibor 
and encircling the mound with jewish cemetery tombstones which 
were torn down by the nazis for use as paving 
polish workers will make the improvements with money raised by 
the us committee the project is expected to cost 375000 
blatt had another suggestion for the architect walking to a 
field near the mound where the camp crematoriums were located he 
reached at random into the dirt and sifted pieces of human bone 
through his fingers 
he said that the field is used by farmers to graze cattle and 
should be covered with a concrete slab to protect the remains 
wilczur in his remarks to the group of about 20 people said 
polish jews and nonjews alike shared a common awful fate at the 
hands of the nazis 
the died for the same reason because one was a jew and the 
other a pole he said 
referring to the 3 million polish jews killed in the holocaust 
about the same number as nonjewish poles who died under the nazis 
wilczur said they were truly our brothers in life in the 
moment of dying and now in their graves 
wilczur added any kind of chauvinism nationalism 
totalitarianism leads in the end to a treblinka or a sobibor one 
they call sobibor another they call katyn the site in the 
soviet union where about 4000 polish officers were found executed 
in world war ii 
murder is murder the blood of innocents is the blood of 
innocents

cancer patients who got morphine at the touch of 
a button to relieve pain stopped using the drug sooner and used 
little more than half the narcotic than patients who got a 
continuous infusion a researcher says 
these patients dont even come close to developing 
addiction said c richard chapman associate research director 
at the pain center of the university of washington and director of 
the pain and toxicity research program at the fred hutchinson 
cancer research center in seattle 
the shorter time on the drug is important because it means an 
earlier end to confusion sedation and other unpleasant reactions 
that accompany morphine treatment he said 
in order to cope you need all your marbles you cant be 
coping effectively when youre on the drug he said 
he spoke in a recent interview about research done with 
hutchinson colleagues including harlan hill costantino benedetti 
and others 
they studied hospitalized patients who had undergone bone marrow 
transplantation as part of cancer therapy as a result of cancer 
treatment such patients commonly suffer pain for two or three 
weeks in the mouth and through the digestive tract and sometimes 
in the hands and feet and elsewhere chapman said 
in the study 32 patients got a continuous infusion of morphine 
through an intravenous line the standard treatment chapman said 
twentysix others got doses by pushing a button on an electric pump 
hooked up to an intravenous line 
the pump was programmed to give no more than one milligram of 
morphine every 10 minutes for each group the decision to stop 
treatment was made jointly between the patient and medical staff 
chapman said 
patients who controlled their morphine used the drug an average 
of about 13 days while those who received a continuous intravenous 
infusion averaged more than 17 days 
the selfadministering group also used only 53 percent as much 
morphine as the other patients 
while the study was not designed to look for addiction no 
selfadminstering patient reported cravings for the drug after the 
treatment stopped chapman said 
selfadministration of drugs might be useful for prolonged pain 
of serious burns or terminal stages of cancer he said it would 
not be suitable for pain that lasts for years such as some cases 
of low back pain he said 
socalled patientcontrolled analgesia has been studied 
extensively for shortterm pain like that following surgery but 
the new work is the first largescale study involving longterm 
pain said richard payne associate professor of neurology at the 
university of cincinnati 
the study is important because it shows patients can safely 
control the amount of drug they get gaining relief without 
overdosing he said 
chapman said results of the study have been submitted for 
publication in a scientific journal 
he spoke while in new york to receive a 50000 pain research 
grant to the university from the bristolmyers co 
other pain grants were awarded to the memorial sloankettering 
cancer center in new york the ann arbor veterans administration 
medical center in michigan the university of texas medical branch 
at galveston and the university of california school of medicine

the number of women in the military has 
climbed to 103 percent of the total force a postworld war ii 
high according to a pentagon report 
at the same time the pentagon continues to see improvement in 
the educational levels of its activeduty personnel it also posted 
a small increase last year in the number of civilian workers on the 
payroll and is paying out pensions to more than 15 million 
individuals 
and by all measures california continues to lead the nation in 
the number of individuals working for the defense department 
those and other statistics are contained in the latest edition 
of an annual pentagon study entitled selected manpower 
statistics the new edition published thursday consists of 222 
pages of tables and covers fiscal 1987 which ended sept 30 
the annual report offers the most comprehensive view available 
of pentagon employment patterns as well as indicators of where 
that force lives and how age sex education and family patterns 
are changing 
the latest edition shows that as of sept 30 the pentagon had 
2160727 men and women on active duty another 13490 men and 
women in the three military academies and 1174826 civilian 
employees around the world including foreign nationals 
the activeduty total was essentially static compared to fiscal 
1986 up about 5100 while dod civilian personnel increased by 
about 21800 during the fiscal year the report shows 
both the activeduty and civilian employment figures are 
declining this year and will continue to fall to accommodate cuts 
in the fiscal 1989 budget 
in a section on activeduty trends the report discloses that 
there are now 222338 female officers and enlisted personnel and 
another 1467 women in the various military academies for a total 
of 223805 
that represents 103 percent of the military force and is the 
highest level recorded since 1945 when world war ii ended with 
266256 women in the military 
the report also shows that women managed to increase their 
presence slightly at the military academies where new officers are 
trained in fiscal 1985 females comprised 1033 percent of the 
academy students in fiscal 1986 the figure climbed to 1063 
percent and last year to 109 percent 
the report says 5335 percent of all military personnel are now 
married down slightly from the 546 percent reported in fiscal 
1986 and military personnel are supporting 28 million 
dependents also down slightly from the previous year 
every service the air force navy marine corps and army 
continues to have more military dependents than it does activeduty 
personnel the report shows 
on the educational side the percentage of enlisted personnel in 
the military who have completed high school increased by almost a 
full percentage point last year from 965 percent to 972 percent 
earlier reports have shown a dramatic increase in the number of 
new recruits with a highschool degree the manpower study 
however covers all enlisted personnel and not just recruits 
the study also shows there are now 153 million military 
annuitants supported by the pentagon an annuitant is an 
individual who has either retired with a pension after a minimum 20 
years of service retired with benefits because of a disability or 
is a family entitled to survivor benefits 
most of the annuitants about 12 million are regular 
pensioners in 1950 there were only 58752 such retirees the 
increase has already prompted congress to revise the pension system 
with an eye toward cutting future costs 
california easily held down its longstanding no 1 ranking in 
defense department employees with 206495 military personnel and

government officials are considering removing a 
popular antiacne drug from the market because they estimate it has 
caused more than 900 babies to be born with severe birth defects 
the new york times reported friday 
the officials said they are also considering asking the maker of 
accutane roche laboratories a division of hoffmanla roche inc 
to limit severely its distribution the newspaper said the drug is 
used against disfiguring acne 
a spokeswoman for the manufacturer thursday night disputed the 
figures saying it has reports of 62 cases of accutanerelated 
birth defects among the 700000 to 1 million patients with cystic 
acne for whom the drug has been prescribed 
despite clear warnings that the drug can cause devastating and 
sometimes fatal deformities if taken by pregnant women experts 
estimate thousands have taken accutane during pregnancy since it 
came on the market in 1982 according to the times 
in a confidential memorandum dated feb 11 and obtained thursday 
by the times officials of the food and drug administration 
estimated that 900 to 1300 babies were born with severe birth 
defects because of the drug from 1982 to 1986 
they also attributed 700 to 1000 spontaneous abortions to the 
use of accutane and they estimated that an additional 5000 to 
7000 women had induced abortions solely because of accutane 
exposure and fear of birth defects the newspaper reported 
the estimates were extrapolated from data collected in a 
michigan medicaid study 
carolyn glynn spokeswoman for hoffmanlaroche in nutley nj 
said the company would meet with the fda on tuesday to discuss ways 
to better educate the public doctors and pharmacists about the 
dangerous and often fatal side effects 
we do not want to dispute the fact that this drug is 
associated with birth defects she said we want to find ways 
to further reinforce that message 
ms glynn said that in the 62 cases of birth defects known to 
the company the babies were born with severe disfigurations 
primarily malformations of the head and ears about half the 
afflicted children died at birth she said 
accutane accounts for between 40 million and 50 million in 
sales annually she said 
the drug shuts down the production of sebum which is the oily 
fatty susbstance that causes the inflamation pain and eventualy 
scarring of cystic acne the drugs generic name is isotretinoin 
by september 1987 the federal drug agency had received reports 
of only 52 babies with accutanecaused deformities according to 
the times 
officials believe that many women and their doctors did not 
always recognize the link between the drug and deformities in 
babies 
accutane carries a strong warning label and the company has 
conducted extensive campaigns to publicize its risk of causing 
birth defects 
dr robert stern a dermatologist at the harvard medical school 
agreed the situation is a serious problem but he said accutane 
is the only treatment available for many patients with disfiguring 
acne 
accutane is an extremely important drug he told the times 
he stressed that severe acne left uncontrolled scars patients 
both physically and psychologically

the political spotlight shines briefly in 
state after state before the candidates and the attention move 
on left behind are supporters who continue the lonely fight for 
delegates in sometimes long drawnout selection processes 
fifteen states are still involved in multistep caucuses and 
conventions to select delegates to the democratic national 
convention in atlanta july 1821 
idaho and kansas michigan and minnesota washington and 
wyoming nevada south dakota and the virgin islands may be ancient 
political history to some but for the democratic hopefuls these 
and other caucus states hold 599 of the 2081 delegates needed to 
nominate 
and in some states the possibility exists for candidates to 
improve on delegate totals as the caucus system proceeds 
in south carolina and north dakota the threestep process ended 
this past weekend with state conventions changing political 
fortunes enabled dukakis to pick up seven delegates in south 
carolina after early precinct results projected none for the 
massachusetts governor 
jackson finished with 28 and tennessee sen albert gore jr got 
eight 
in other caucus states the campaigns are renewing their efforts 
as the large number of precinct delegates decide whom they will 
vote for at congressional district and state conventions 
in the states where theres a big uncommitted bloc at the tier 
lower than the cd congressional district level we have an 
equal opportunity said susan brophy a delegate counter for the 
dukakis campaign 
in iowa back on feb 8 missouri rep richard gephardt was the 
winner in the precinct caucuses with illinois sen paul simon 
second and dukakis third based on those results gephardt had 
enough precinct delegates to assure him of 20 national delegates 
gephardt has since withdrawn and simon who was in line for 17 
delegates has suspended campaigning though he wants to keep his 
delegates dukakis had enough support for 17 national delegates 
as the may 14 district conventions near when iowans will pick 
real live breathing national delegates in the words of iowa 
democratic party communications director phil roeder the campaigns 
are focusing on the uncommitted simon and gephardt delegates to 
the district conventions 
theres been some movement toward dukakis but not 
wholesale roeder said the gephardt and simon people want to 
see what happens or at least at the state convention june 25 
have some strength to get people elected 
so much attention is placed on being first roeder said 
but iowa is the longest spread out over five months you have to 
see it from beginning to end no decision is set in stone 
the jackson campaign has used its local volunteers in an effort 
to pick up iowa delegates while the dukakis forces reopened their 
iowa office and have a staffer preparing for the conventions 
according to roeder 
their work however may be overshadowed by this weeks primary 
results in new york and results from approaching primaries which 
could sway delegates before the district conventions this is a 
critical time roeder said 
other states with long selection processes include alaska 
colorado and hawaii 
in maine which held local caucuses on feb 28 dukakis emerged 
with 10 delegates and jackson eight but a large bloc remained 
uncommitted the candidates looking toward the states may 1315 
state convention see the uncommitted numbers as fertile territory 
for padding their totals 
both dukakis and jackson have made a concentrated effort 
said frederick barton chairman of the state democratic party 
theyre trying to build on their numbers jackson had a meeting 
in bangor with over 100 people whoever does the job over the 
next three weeks will reap the benefits 
the party itself is enjoying the fruits of the candidates labor 
as close to 3000 people are expected at the state convention in 
portland it will be the largest ever due in large part to this 
issue barton said 
party leaders in kansas where congressional district 
conventions will be held saturday see dukakis and jackson 
delegates holding solid but expect some movement among the 
uncommitted and gore delegates 
things do change between march 19 and april 23 said jim 
parrish kansas democratic party chairman

a doctors antismoking group has decided to 
sponsor the us boomerang team after the team said it turned down 
a deal for tv coverage and 15000 in support from the philip 
morris tobacco company 
alan blum chairman and founder of doctors ought to care or 
doc says the group wants to underscore dangers of tobacco company 
sponsorship of sports especially the recruiting of new smokers 
among youthful sports fans 
by putting the athletes out there with a nosmoking image 
were going to make the point in a costeffective way with kids 
around the world blum said in a telephone interview thursday 
the nations two largest tobacco companies philip morris and 
rj reynolds sponsor a wide range of sporting events philip 
morris has the virginia slims tennis tournament and supports auto 
racing and soccer in connection with marlboro cigarettes rj 
reynolds tobacco supports auto races with its camel and winston 
cigarettes and golf tournaments with vantage cigarettes 
such efforts blum said are telling youth that being a tennis 
player or a soccer player goes handinhand with being a marlboro 
man 
philip morris disputed the teams version of events we 
rejected them said steven weiss the companys manager of media 
relations they had no opportunity to reject us as soon as we 
found out that some members of the team had concerns about being 
sponsored by a tobacco company we decided not to pursue the 
sponsorship idea any further 
about blum weiss said in his usual frothingatthemouth 
hysteria hes trying to create a large situation out of something 
thats really minor and meaningless 
were trying to do something said blum were trying to 
spark the outrage thats needed and get rid of tobacco and sports 
once and for all 
doc opposes the promotion of alcohol and tobacco and tries to 
educate the public to the dangers of drug abuse 
the boomerang team is trying to raise the 12000 the us 
boomerang team needs to go to australia for the world cup of 
boomerang competition may 615 in barooga new south wales 
chet snouffer a gymnastics instructor in delaware ohio and 
captain of the team said the philip morris deal would have 
required team members to among other things wear the philip 
morris logo on national television 
the decision was made to forego said money and take a stance 
for boomerangs as a positive health promotion and not linked to a 
tobacco company snouffer said in a statement 
in addition to snouffer who took first place at the boomerang 
world championships in paris in 1985 the us team is made up of 
eric darnell of south strafford vt who finished second in paris 
and barnaby ruhe of new york 
when the idea of philip morris sponsorship was raised darnell 
who has asthma and is strongly opposed to smoking refused to don 
the tobacco company logo i offered to withdraw from the team 
he said the team decided instead to reject the philip morris 
offer darnell said 
blum and doc have raised 2000 so far and small contributions 
from individuals are trickling in blum said that leaves the team 
10000 short however with scarcely more than a week before their 
may 1 departure 
were looking for individuals or others to pick that up or 
else were going to have to pay it out of our own pockets 
snouffer said in a telephone interview but weve kind of set a 
precedent 
i think they shot themselves in the foot says the agent who 
had arranged the philip morris deal peter sawyer of the fifi 
oscard agency in new york city if philip morris wanted to get 
behind the sport youre talking about making boomerangs into 
frisbees i dont know whether that was in their marketing plans 
but if the sport caught on they could have adopted it

president reagans star wars missile defense 
system has fared better in earlyround budget votes in the senate 
than in the house 
a senate subcommittee meeting behind closed doors voted late 
thursday to authorize 46 billion in the next fiscal year for star 
wars said the sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
the decision by the subcommittee on strategic weapons and 
nuclear deterrence came as the senate armed services committee 
began writing its version of the 299 billion bill providing for 
the pentagon budget during the 12 months which begin oct 1 
reagan had originally sought 48 billion for the program known 
formally as the strategic defense initiative 
next week the full house will begin considering its version of 
the pentagon budget bill which includes 4 billion for star wars 
the current sdi budget is 39 billion 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house panel said he 
expects the house eventually to grant about 4 billion for star 
wars despite attempts by conservatives to raise the figure and 
liberals to cut it 
differences between the bills which eventually emerge from each 
chamber will have to be reconciled by a housesenate conference 
committee 
both measures provide a total of 299 billion a figure that was 
already known before the long congressional budget process started 
three months ago the total was agreed upon last december by reagan 
and congressional negotiators as they put together a plan aimed at 
reducing federal budget deficits 
the senate subcommittee also generally granted administration 
requests for the midgetman and mx missiles the sources said 
reagan had wanted 200 million for research into the 
singlewarhead midgetman and 800 million for research into basing 
the 10warhead mx weapon aboard trains on western military 
reservations 
by contrast the house measure also raises spending on the 
midgetman to 500 million while reducing the mx request to 500 
million 
the midgetman is a singlewarhead missile backed by 
congressional democrats but opposed by the pentagon defense 
secretary frank c carlucci said he wanted to eliminate the 
midgetman program entirely but agreed to include 200 million at 
the request of congress to keep the program alive until reagans 
successor can make a decision about its fate

pete ampatzis is a businessman with 
conservative views who twice voted for ronald reagan but when it 
came to supporting democrat michael dukakis for president he never 
hesitated 
dukakis hes got the guts i believe dukakis is a strong man 
better than vice president george bush said ampatzis who came 
to this country in 1969 from greece 
the massachusetts governor is the son of greek immigrants and 
has attracted strong loyalty in philadelphias small but proud 
greek community as tuesdays pennsylvania primary approaches 
ampatzis 52 who owns two downtown restaurants sent to new 
york for dukakis bumper stickers even before the massachusetts 
governor opened a campaign office here 
those stickers adorn his delivery trucks and a sign in a front 
window at his restaurant lists the names of delegate candidates who 
are pledged to dukakis 
this shows we are something he said it makes greeks more 
american people say you are an immigrant they look down on you 
this shows we are part of this country i feel very proud 
his friend nicholas savvas of suburban havertown remembers 
discrimination from the 1950s 
people called us dishwashers he said he especially likes 
the way dukakis shows pride in his heritage 
everywhere he goes he says i am greekamerican that makes 
every greekamerican feel good 
support from the greek community has been important since the 
early days when dukakis set off on his quest for the democratic 
nomination for president says press secretary mark gearan 
they were crucial in terms of initial support to the 
campaign gearan said i can generally say the greekamerican 
community has been extraordinarily generous 
people put 10 15 in an envelope and mail it to dukakis 
said ampatzis like the ancient greeks said if you dont 
participate you have nothing 
petes famous pizza shop contributes in another way 
occasionally sending over a few pizzas for the volunteers at 
dukakis headquarters 
many of these volunteers are students with no money he 
said with a shrug we have to support them many other 
restaurants are doing the same thing 
ethnic group voting is a hallowed practice in american politics 
it is why blacks are voting for jesse jackson by margins like 95 
percent over his white rivals it is why frank rizzo won 94 percent 
of the italianamerican vote over his rivals in the 1983 democratic 
mayoral primary 
if you dont know where a candidate stands said former city 
controller joseph vignola you can figure that a candidate who 
shares your ethnic heritage is going to be more in line with your 
thinking share your concerns its perfectly natural 
ampatzis believes dukakis will win the support of an even larger 
ethnic group in philadelphia the italians 
all the greeks voted for rizzo he said were like 
brothers the italians and the greeks look back at our history 
the italians will be for dukakis 100 percent 
city councilman james tayoun a lebaneseamerican whose district 
includes large numbers of italian voters agrees 
anybody whose name has got a little life to it will do well 
down here he said dukakis is that kind of name 
but rizzo now campaign manager for republican candidate george 
bush does not believe the dukakis ethnic appeal will be strong 
enough 
dukakis has been criticized in some quarters for being too bland 
and noncontroversial but rizzo told the philadelphia daily news 
that as far as im concerned hes a radical 
his positions are just not the positions of the ethnics that i 
was born and raised with rizzo said 
savvas insists that he isnt supporting dukakis just because of 
their shared heritage 
he is a good man he said he comes from a good family 
hes got a very good program 
still neither he nor ampatzis can think of a single 
greekamerican they know who would support another candidate 
i dont think any greekamerican would say that except for 
someone who was really mixed up in republican politics savvas 
said and when those people get in the voting booth they will be 
for dukakis

a man who was inspired by the deadly 1980 mgm 
grand hotel fire in las vegas nev to invent a portable smoke 
alarm has won a 332 million judgment against companies that 
marketed a similar device 
the federal court verdict wednesday protects oregon resident 
fred stilwells contractual rights to sleepsafe which straps over 
a hotel room door and is designed to sound an alarm and shine a 
light when smoke is detected 
stilwell survived a fire in his home before the las vegas blaze 
that left 84 people dead he checked out of the mgm grand three 
days earlier 
thats what tripped it off stillwell said wednesday i 
registered my idea within two days of the mgm fire i didnt even 
go to work for three days 
the lawsuit stemmed from stilwells contract with two orange 
county businessmen to help secure certification from underwriters 
laboratories to permit the alarm to be sold at major retail stores 
the contract then called for the companies to take over 
distribution with a percentage of the profits going to stilwell 
stilwells lawyer kevin roddy said wing wah chong a hong kong 
corporation headed by laurence chen of palos verdes estates and 
american scitec the companys american representative never 
delivered on their promises and began distributing a similar device 
the defendants who included john skarman of huntington beach 
and roy ludt of costa mesa claimed that they had done everything 
possible to obtain the ul listing but that design limitations made 
it impossible

when gloria ahern arrived at her daughters 
home about a week ago she found an empty house strangers at the 
door and family mementos in the trash 
the house she learned had been hurriedly sold and her 
pregnant daughter her soninlaw and grandchild had vanished 
a few days later she said her 35yearold daughter called to 
say hi mommy were in south carolina praising the lord 
i said linda youre sick please come home and with that 
she hung up 
mrs ahern of suburban broomall is among a group of 40 people 
in the delaware valley who believe their children have fallen prey 
to a christian cult inspired by a southern radio evangelist called 
brother rg stair 
she said stairs broadcast predictions of nuclear holocaust 
induced her children to sell their belongings for a song and seek 
shelter at his organizations farm in walterboro sc 
under his command or the dictates of his agents his followers 
have abandoned their families and friends signed over their funds 
and upended their lives other parents said 
thats ridiculous said stair a 54yearold selfproclaimed 
prophet from his 74acre farm on thursday there is no power 
that i have that compels people to do anything im like a doctor 
or a lawyer i can give my opinion i can tell them whats best for 
them and thats as far as i can go 
they have been under mind control absolutely thats what it 
is for months on end mrs ahern insisted they were like 
puppets on a string if they were told to do something they did 
it 
mary del guidice also of broomall said she has put a lien on 
her daughters house to try to stop her from leaving town 
they think the world is going to end we are all going to die 
and go to hell except his people who go down south there they are 
going to be safe she said 
the parents have sought support from two area pastors and the 
cult awareness network a national nonprofit group based in 
chicago the president of the philadelphia afflilate marjorie 
patton said stairs organization has all the characteristics of a 
cult and she compared him to jim jones whose followers committed 
mass suicide in guyana 
its very important to recognize that the potential for 
tragedy is quite high she said when a leader has that much 
control over people then you know they can gain more control 
stair originally from bethlehem pa said the comparison was 
baseless he said his 40 followers voluntarily chose a christian 
life of selfdenial in the country where the cost of living is 
cheaper 
law enforcement officials say they have found no illegalities in 
the cults practices 
everybody that weve talked to who is associated with this 
religion is doing it of their own free will and he stair hasnt 
threatened anybody said greg auld fbi agent in suburban newtown 
square they are freely giving over their possessions to the 
community 
the three families who arrived from the delaware valley and the 
other followers are free to come and go free to receive visitors 
and manage their funds in their own accounts he said 
together they believe that the economy will collapse in may 
that president reagan will not complete his term and that nuclear 
war will envelop the world before the year is out he said 
chuck rose a selfdescribed christian counselor from broomall 
now at the farm said he has promoted stairs teachings in the 
delaware valley for more than a year although he first met stair 
only within the last six months 
rose said he announced his plan to join stair but exerted no 
pressure upon the nine families who comprised his congregation 
mrs aherns daughter linda mccourt did not return telephone 
calls to the farm on thursday

attorney general edwin meese iii did not 
remove himself from government decisions involving the wealthy 
bender family that supplies his wifes salary until a news report 
disclosed that a bender partnership had won a 50 million lease for 
justice department offices meeses spokesman says 
responding to questions thursday justice department spokesman 
terry eastland said meese indicated to me that as of his first 
hearing about any matter of the department that might involve the 
benders he has recused himself 
eastland said meese first learned of that relationship when he 
read an april 13 associated press story on the justice departments 
50 million lease in 1987 with the bender partnership eastland 
said he did not know whether meese had put his recusal decision in 
a written memo to aides 
meeses recusal came one week after bender family members signed 
a separate 11million deal to provide additional offices for the 
justice department government records show 
that is the second major lease involving the bender family and 
the justice department since the family foundation began funding 
ursula meeses job in january 1986 
meese and the justice department officials say he played no role 
in either lease and there was no connection between the deals and 
ursula meeses salary 
mrs meeses 40000ayear salary at the multiple sclerosis 
society is paid by a grant from the bender foundation the familys 
taxexempt philanthropy according to ms attorney james bierbower 
recusal is a common way government officials and private lawyers 
avoid conflicts of interest or the appearance of them by removing 
themselves from decisions in which they may appear to benefit 
financially 
donald campbell general counsel of the office of government 
ethics said in an interview that recusal is the safer prudent 
step for any cabinet official who learns of a connection like the 
one involving the meeses and benders 
new york university law professor stephen gillers an expert on 
legal ethics said in an interview that its a little late for 
meese to recuse himself 
frankly once she got the job it was his job to inquire about 
the source of funds as soon as he knew the benders were the 
source directly or indirectly of mrs meeses salary he should 
have sent around a screening memorandum telling subordinates he 
would take no part in benderrelated decisions 
independent counsel james mckay is investigating mrs meeses 
salary and the bender familys real estate dealings with the 
justice department as part of his inquiry into whether meese has 
any criminal conflicts of interest mrs meese appeared before 
mckays grand jury thursday 
the benders two of whom have appeared before the grand jury 
have refused to comment as has their attorney seymour glanzer 
the bender family has large real estate holdings in washington 
the family has built us government buildings including fbi 
headquarters and has leased several offices to the government 
the bender familys role in paying mrs meeses salary was 
publicly disclosed in the washington post on march 30 
on april 8 the general services administration the government 
housekeeping agency signed a twoyear lease for 694236 coupled 
with a 430000 renovation contract with blake development co and 
blake construction co respectively 
blake construction co is a bender family firm blake 
development is a partnership which includes three members of the 
bender family blake construction and five other persons 
when the associated press first asked the gsa on april 56 for 
all bender or blake leases with justice this lease was not 
disclosed because negotiations were not final gsa spokesman dale 
bruce said it was provided april 20 after the ap called back and 
specifically requested it based on information developed elsewhere 
the lease covers 12522 square feet on the fourth floor of the 
blake building three blocks from the white house justice 
department spokesman brad marman said the space will be used by 
independent counsel lawrence walsh as a secure location for defense 
attorneys in the irancontra conspiracy trial to review classified 
government documents 
blake was the only bidder who could meet our needs for space 
in the time frame we required marman said the government wanted 
to move in may 1 
the standard government contract was amended to include a 
special rider requiring blake to monitor asbestos insulation in the 
building to avoid employee exposure to cancercausing breathable 
fibers the gsa regularly tries to avoid leasing buildings with 
asbestos problems 
this lease did not come to meeses attention as far as justice 
management division knows marman said blake came to our 
attention through the normal competitive bidding process of the 
gsa we did not actively solicit anyone by name 
robert w goodman the gsa contracting officer who signed the 
lease said blake submitted one of only two bids both of which 
came from four companies solicited to bid 
gsa learned of the blake space from the fred ezra co a 
commercial real estate broker goodman said 
at the ezra firm broker richard rome said his firm was brought 
into the search by the justice management division rome said 
justice officials had nothing to do with his locating the blake 
space it was totally by coincidence that it was a blake 
building rome said 
marman confirmed that justice called in the ezra firm after its 
own officials were unable to find appropriate space he said of the 
blake location with very little problem it met our 
requirements 
the associated press disclosed april 13 that a bender 
partnership had purchased a building housing justices immigration 
and naturalization service in 1985 as the government planned to 
begin moving out that move was canceled after the purchase and 
the bender partnership later signed a 50 million 10year lease 
renewal the government lease enabled the partnership to sell the 
building in 1987 for 226 million more than it cost the new owner 
said

a tax credit for all families with preschool 
children and a massive 25 billion day care expansion are emerging 
as the key issues in a congressional debate on how to ease the 
nations child care problems 
education secretary william bennett said thursday that the 
reagan administration opposes the 25 billion act for better child 
care but he said the tax credit proposal meets the 
administrations standards for a child care policy and he 
personally favors it 
bennett told members of the house education and labor 
subcommittee on human resources he didnt know whether the 
administration would offer its own child care tax credit plan or 
support other federal initiatives to help make care more affordable 
and available 
i couldnt tell you he said its a matter of debate and 
discussion within the administration right now 
three approaches were discussed at the hearing the abc bill 
backed by democratic leaders and scores of groups representing 
women children labor churches and medical personnel a tax 
credit bill sponsored by rep clyde holloway rla and a 
middleground proposal introduced by sen orrin hatch rutah and 
rep nancy johnson rconn 
the holloway bill would give all families a credit of 150 to 
400 per preschool child whether the children were cared for at 
home or elsewhere total cost 800 million the government already 
is spending 37 billion on a dependent care tax credit available 
to families with children in day care holloway said 
bennett said any child care policy endorsed by the 
administration would have to strengthen the family treat 
stayathome mothers fairly not promote any particular type of 
care target funds to those most in need and help people without 
setting up a new bureaucracy 
he said the holloway approach meets all those tests 
the tax credit concept also appears to sidestep churchstate 
problems cited by the american civil liberties union which is in 
an odd alliance with conservatives in opposing the abc bill 
the aclu objections center on the possibility that 
religioussponsored day care programs would qualify for abc grants 
and parent subsidies the bills sponsor rep dale kildee 
dmich said he is working on changes to make sure churches are 
eligible while the aclu says the bill even as introduced violates 
the separation of church and state 
this is one big new federal trough for churches said barry 
lynn legislative counsel to the aclu too many of them want it 
and theyre not willing to recognize the serious constitutional 
issues here 
threequarters of the abc money would help pay the child care 
bills in families making up to 115 percent of a states median 
income the rest would go for training and salaries for child care 
workers renovation of facilities and referral programs for 
parents a national advisory panel would develop minimum federal 
child care standards 
supporters of the bill say the federal government must play the 
lead role in helping to expand day care services ensure their 
quality and make them more affordable to american families 
but conservatives including phyllis schlafly complained thursday 
that the abc bill is too expensive and cumbersome promotes 
institutional care and discriminates against parents who stay at 
home with their children and they said the income cutoff in the 
bill would let some families earning 40000 get financial help 
the hatchjohnson child care services improvement act would give 
states 250 million in grant money for day care expansion and 
scholarships and 100 million to start risk pools to limit provider 
liability another 25 million would be available to help home 
providers meet state licensing requirements 
the us chamber of commerce and the national association of 
manufacturers have endorsed positions similar to the hatchjohnson 
approach

here are the answers to frequently asked 
questions about the airline smoking ban that goes into effect at 
1201 am saturday 
q what flights are covered by the ban 
a those that are scheduled according to the official airline 
guide as lasting two hours or less charter flights and 
international flights and any flight by a foreign airline are 
exempt 
q how many flights will be affected 
a about 80 percent of the roughly 17300 daily domestic flights 
by the major airlines smoking already has been prohibited on 
commuter flights when the aircraft have 30 or fewer seats 
q what if the flight is delayed in the air or on the ground and 
takes longer than two hours 
a the nosmoking ban still will apply as long as the scheduled 
time of the flight is two hours or less 
q for the purposes of the smoking ban what is considered a 
flight 
a a flight is any single segment between two cities on a 
washingtonlos angeles flight with a stop in st louis for 
example the ban would apply to the washingtonst louis segment 
that is less than two hours but not to the st louislos angeles 
segment which exceeds two hours 
q how do i determine whether a flight is two hours or less 
a check the airline schedule or ask the travel agent to give 
you the scheduled departure and arrival times of each flight 
segment to determine the duration of the flight take note that the 
departure and arrival will be in local time and any change in time 
zones must be taken into account 
q who enforces the smoking ban 
a normally a flight attendant will advise a passenger to stop 
smoking if that does not work the passenger will be asked to 
provide his or her name and address which will be forwarded to the 
federal aviation administration for enforcement action if the 
passenger refuses to provide the information he or she may be 
guilty of interfering with the operation of a flight crew a 
federal crime and may be subject to arrest upon landing 
q what is the penalty for smoking on a nosmoking flight 
a a passenger may face a civil penalty of up to 1000 for each 
offense tampering with a smoke detector in an aircraft lavatory 
carries a 2000 fine 
q if a flight has one stop and has both a smoking and 
nosmoking segment how does a traveler avoid being caught in the 
wrong section of the plane during one of the segments 
a travelers should ask to be seated in the appropriate section 
of the aircraft at the beginning of the trip to avoid having to be 
reseated even if the first segment of a flight prohibits smoking 
the traveler should ask specifically to be seated in either a 
smoking or nosmoking section to avoid being in the wrong section 
during the second leg of the flight in which smoking is permitted 
q if a traveler already holds a reservation or paid ticket for 
a seat in the smoking section of a twohourorless flight will he 
or she be allowed to smoke after the rule goes into effect 
a no smoking still will be prohibited on that flight 
q on some flights a trip between two cities may take less than 
two hours in one direction but because of headwinds or traffic 
flow take more than two hours when returning how does the smoke 
rule treat this 
a the smoking ban does not apply to flights of more than two 
hours however airlines are free to prohibit smoking on any flight 
if they wish to maintain consistency some airlines have chosen to 
impose a smoking ban on flights going in both direction between the 
same two cities if the elapsed times are similar 
q is there a way to find a nosmoking flight on trips of more 
than two hours 
a airlines are free to prohibit smoking on flights of more than 
two hours so far northwest airlines has decided to ban smoking on 
all flights within the continental united states regardless of 
duration no other us airline has done so but a traveler could 
select a combination of flight segments each of which are two hours 
or less and have nosmoking flights throught a trip this however 
may take longer and may cost more than the most direct flights 
q what if i have a ticket on a flight where smoking is 
prohibit but the flight is canceled or overbooked and the airline 
reroutes me to another flight that is more than two hours long is 
smoking permitted on the flight i take 
a yes the rule applies to whatever flight is actually taken 
when passengers are rerouted they should check on the smoking 
status of the new flight and make their preferences known to the 
airline beforehand

environmental groups have suffered another 
defeat in their battle with the reagan administration and the oil 
industry over opening the arctic national wildlife refuge to 
petroleum development 
the latest setback came thursday as the house merchant marine 
subcommittee on fisheries and wildlife conservation and the 
environment voted 179 against putting off a congressional decision 
on the refuge for at least two years 
syd butler a vice president of the wilderness society said the 
margin of the defeat means that the subcommittee and then the full 
committee will probably approve a bill to allow oil rigs into the 
refuge in alaska 
but a major proponent of such legislation rep don young 
ralaska said he wasnt as certain i never count my chickens 
until ive got the bones in my mouth he said 
the drilling issue is a struggle between environmentalists who 
want no development and the administration and the oil industry 
which say the refuge contains potentially rich oil deposits needed 
to offset growing us dependence on imported petroleum 
drilling advocates won the first congressional round earlier 
this year when the senate energy and natural resources committee 
voted 118 for a development bill that is awaiting floor debate 
pending in the house subcommittee is a compromise plan by full 
committee chairman walter jones dnc to allow phased leasing 
and development of the refuges 15 millionacre coastal plain 
the activity could begin as soon as 21 months after enactment so 
long as it did not significantly harm the pristine coastal plain or 
its wildlife including a caribou herd whose principal calving area 
would be offlimits to rigs 
the rejected amendment by reps mike lowry dwash and 
claudine schneider rri would have shelved the drilling issue 
until the interior department spent from two to three years 
drafting a national energy policy emphasizing conservation and 
renewable resources 
lowry said that an administration decision to cut vehiclefleet 
efficiency standards would over the years waste 9 billion barrels 
of oil the most optimistic estimate of the refuges reserves 
opponents argued that putting energy policy language into the 
refuge bill would kill it for this session of congress because it 
would have to be referred to an uncertain fate in the house energy 
and commerce committee 
butler said environmentalists are more optimistic about their 
chances in the house interior committee which also has 
jurisdiction over the issue and which traditionally has been more 
receptive to their desires 
interiors water and power resources subcommittee has 
tentatively scheduled legislative hearings on the refuge question 
for three days early in june

president reagan is voicing fear that senate 
failure to approve a nuclear missile treaty quickly will put a 
strain on his summit next month with soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev 
answering questions from an audience in springfield mass 
reagan also sought thursday to lower expectations that the 
superpowers will agree soon on an accord to slash their arsenals of 
intercontinental ballistic missiles 
during a speech which white house officials said would outline 
some us objectives at the may 29june 2 summit in moscow reagan 
said relations between washington and moscow have reached a 
period of realistic engagement 
the president said the united states has achieved some successes 
in recent dealings with the kremlin because american policy toward 
the soviet union has placed more emphasis on preaching the gospel 
of freedom around the world rather than merely seeking to contain 
communist expansionism 
reagans speech to the world affairs council of western 
massachusetts was the second of its kind in recent weeks as he and 
his aides prepare for the coming summit 
asked by a law student to describe what would happen if the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty is not ratified by the 
senate by the time the summit arrives reagan said i think it 
would be very upsetting and it would put a strain on the summit 
we hope and pray that they will approve the pact but the 
scheduling of it has been such that i am very concerned we may have 
to go without having it ratified he said 
reagan got little comfort on that score thursday as senate 
majority leader robert c byrd dwva declared i am not going 
to rush to judgment 
byrd said the senate will not speed through the ratification 
debate scheduled to start may 9 
we want a good treaty that is our objective the senator 
said adding that the white houserequested summit deadline for 
ratification doesnt guide me at all 
several senators have expressed concern that provisions of the 
inf treaty may ban development of futuristic weapons 
en route to massachusetts presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said well be working with the hill on this problem 
but he also said it would be a shame if it did not happen we 
think we can overcome any obstacles but there are still hurdles to 
be crossed 
in response to another question during the springfield outing 
reagan acknowledged that theres a great question about whether 
a treaty banning up to 50 percent of longrange nuclear missiles 
can be ready for signing during the moscow summit 
but he said that we dont want a fast treaty we want a good 
treaty we have never set a deadline for agreement on the 
strategic arms reduction pact start 
in his speech reagan apparently sought to lower expectations 
about an agreement on a start pact he said that as part of the 
ussoviet agenda arms control is not sturdy enough to bear up 
the whole platform of sovietamerican relations 
because of this the president said he will focus on a variety 
of issues in moscow including regional disputes in afghanistan 
nicaragua and elsewhere as well as human rights and bilateral 
relations 
reagan said that while much headway has been made in relations 
between the superpowers he remains wary of moscows intentions 
the president said for instance hes not sure of the 
genuineness of the soviet agreement to withdraw from afghanistan 
let me say here that the next few months will be no time for 
complacency no time to sit back and congratulate ourselves he 
said the soviets have rarely before and not at all in more than 
three decades left a country once occupied they have often 
promised to leave but rarely in their history and then only under 
pressure from the west have they actually done it

george bush is closing fast on the number of 
delegates needed to win the republican presidential nomination and 
could top that level within the next few days which would be even 
sooner than his advisers had expected 
according to delegate counts maintained by both the associated 
press and the bush campaign the vice president seems almost 
certain to have the necessary delegates by next tuesday after the 
pennsylvania primary 
thats a week earlier than bush campaign officials previously 
had anticiated the campaign had not expected to reach the level 
until may 3 after primaries in ohio indiana and the district of 
columbia 
were in neutral as to when the date is well take it when it 
comes said ed rogers a campaign official 
the vice presidents only remaining gop opposition is former 
television evangelist pat robertson who has ceased active 
campaigning 
according to the ap count bush had 1058 delegates as of 
thursday while robertson had a scant 17 bushs own count puts him 
at 1066 right now 
bush could actually top the threshold before the pennsylvania 
primary at which 78 gop delegates will be selected 
minnesota republicans were selecting 15 delegates this week a 
nevada state gop convention on saturday will choose another 20 
in addition there currently are 45 loose delegates ones 
chosen as uncommitted or whose candidates have dropped out of the 
race leaving them free to recommit bush is widely expected to 
pick up most of these delegates 
we did gear up for may 3 and now its coming before then 
said a campaign official who declined to be identified by name 
its not as if we were planning to have a parade but we had been 
looking at some different things to do 
top bush aides met on thursday to discuss the likelihood that 
bush would go over the top earlier than expected and to make plans 
for how to greet the development campaign sources said 
one problem is that pennsylvanias primary selects blind 
delegates individuals by name without reference to which 
candidate they support 
i would rather err on the side of waiting than have anyone 
accuse us of jumping the gun said bush campaign manager lee 
atwater 
however he added we feel confident well be right around 
that number needed to nominate right after pennsylvania 
president reagan who has remained nominally neutral in the race 
until now is expected to lend campaign support to bush once the 
vice president is actually over the top campaign aides have said 
bush says that the timing of the reagan assistance is not 
important 
theres no question of where the president is gong to be when 
this election comes forward he said earlier this week so i 
dont feel under any pressure on this 
bush has had a virtual lock on the nomination since his last 
major rival sen bob dole withdrew from the race on march 29 and 
released his delegates

jesse jackson is winning high marks among many 
of his fellow democrats for taking the high road in refusing to 
be drawn into negative camaigning even while under siege from new 
york mayor ed koch 
jackson speaks frequently of party unity accepting both his 
defeats and victories with grace and tells his rivals not to 
attack one another but to focus on victory in november over the 
republicans 
his conduct during the new york primary race fit the pattern he 
has been carefully following avoiding attacks on his rivals 
when the new york race was over he praised the campaign of the 
winner michael dukakis and called for a measure of 
cooperation as well as a measure of competition for the 
remainder of the campaign 
the behavior has been noticed among leaders of his party where 
once he was considered a divisive force 
hes performed a kind of unifying and leading function 
throughout the campaign said william carrick who was manager of 
richard gephardts democratic campaign before the missouri 
congressman dropped out of the race 
i think democrats all over the country are giving jackson high 
marks for his conduct during the campaign he said jesse has 
tried to keep to the high road he has not been critical its been 
a deliberate conscious effort 
the effort was apparent when jackson held back from replying as 
koch who endorsed sen albert gore jr tried to mix it up by 
calling jackson antiisrael and accusing him of lying about his 
actions in the aftermath of the death of his mentor dr martin 
luther king 
when asked by reporters to respond jackson said some people 
are making hysteria while im making history 
while ed koch was being a thug jesse jackson was being a 
diplomat said bob beckel former campaign manager for the 1984 
presidential campaign of walter mondale the art of presidential 
politics has a very heavy dose of discipline and jackson has shown 
good deal of that 
beckel and jackson adviser ann lewis a prominent democratic 
insider both said many party officials have spoken well of the new 
jackson 
theres a real appreciation that he held back in the face 
of kochs attacks said lewis 
beckel said many at first were suspicious of jacksons motives 
but i think hes made a believer out of a lot of people and 
convinced them he is committed to a democratic victory 
lewis said jackson told her more than a year ago that he had 
decided to wage a positive campaign after a 1984 race in which he 
attacked democratic party rules as exclusionary alienated jewish 
voters and fought for the spotlight by traveling abroad to meet 
with controversial figures including cubas fidel castro and 
nicaraguas daniel ortega 
in his earlier years he obviously was a protester said 
jackson adviser bert lance former adviser to president carter 
this time he has grown tremendously and has grown into the 
protecter of the high road 
in the campaign debates jackson has relished the role of the 
conciliator while his rivals squabbled urging them to save their 
fire for the republicans 
while aiming at installing a democratic administration in the 
white house jackson also is angling to make himself a party 
insider rather than the outsider he was in 1984 observers agree 
not only does jackson refrain from attacking his opponents he 
regularly telephones them and has developed a kind of 
camaraderie said his campaign manager gerald austin 
he has pledged he will campaign for the democratic ticket even 
if he is not on it such action should help consolidate his role in 
future party politics 
beckel said i fully expect him to run for president again 
and carrick commented hes doing all the right things for his 
future 
austin noted that jackson at 46 is going to be around for a 
long time

transportation secretary jim burnley and the 
union representing 40000 airline pilots are trading sharp words 
over the usefulness of the unions recently concluded postcard 
safety campaign at eastern airlines 
burnley on thursday accused the pilots of throwing around 
unsubstantiated allegations that gum up the system and prevent 
federal aviation administration inspectors from pursuing other 
serious safety problems 
a day earlier henry duffy president of the air line pilots 
association accused burnley of unfair public carping about the 
unions campaign in which more than a thousand postcards about 
alleged safety defects were sent to the faa and members of congress 
the brouhaha began last weekend when burnley said on national 
television that while the faa has been involved in various 
investigations into easterns safety practices the allegations 
raised by the pilots had been of little help because they did not 
contain enough specifics 
of 1300 postcards complaining about safety problems at eastern 
only six could be substantiated by faa authorities burnley said 
the miamibased carrier is the subject of a planebyplane safety 
review by the faa and faces a possible 823000 civil fine because 
of past safety violations 
alpa president henry duffy accused burnley in a letter of not 
understanding the purpose of the postcard campaign 
i am at a loss as to why you repeatedly engage in public 
carping against the postcard campaign to the point of 
mischaracterizing it and misleading the public duffy wrote 
burnley 
during a meeting with reporters thursday burnley repeated his 
criticism of the alpa effort but said the faa nevertheless tried 
to look into each of the 1300 complaints 
it is a diversion of faa resources and sends our people on a 
wild goose chase when they could be doing serious inspections and 
investigating claims of safety problems that are documented said 
burnley it is at bottom an antisafety device 
complaints that are groundless gum up the system he 
continued 
they would serve safety better if they sent us serious 
complaints burnley said of the 40000member pilots union 
alpa spokesman john mazor said the union would have no further 
comment on burnleys remarks referring instead to duffys letter 
wednesday to burnley which the union released previously 
in the letter duffy said most of the postcards about alleged 
problems at eastern were sent anonymously and lacked some details 
because the pilots feared reprisals if more information were 
provided 
if eastern were to agree to no reprisals against employees 
wishing to report safety problems your desk would be flooded with 
safety reports complete down to the most minute detail of name 
time place and aircraft number wrote duffy 
burnley said the department would take action against any 
airline found taking punitive action against an employee who 
discloses a safety problem eastern management has accused the 
pilots of a slanderous safety campaign and denied safety 
problems at the airline

highvalue products from soup to nuts dominate 
a thriving agricultural export business with canada and the 
agriculture department says there is excellent potential for 
further growth 
trade between the united states and canada is smoothed because 
the two countries share a common language as well as great 
similarities in customs and culture socioeconomic status 
economic structure and consumer preferences says william glynn 
of the departments foreign agricultural service 
canadas 26 million people are the largest foreign market for 
us highvalue products accounting for almost 20 percent of the 
total exports of us those items 
more than 85 percent of all us agricultural exports to canada 
181 billion last year are in the form of highvalue products 
by usda definition highvalue products or hvps are 
valueadded processed products and consumerready products such 
as nuts fresh fruits and vegetables 
glynn in a report scheduled for the may issue of foreign 
agriculture magazine said horticultural and tropical products make 
up the largest component of highvalue trade with canada 
accounting for nearly 62 percent of the us highvalue total 
fresh vegetables lead the list and have shown a slow but 
steady increase over the past several decades he said 
prospects for this trend to continue are favorable 
dairy livestock and poultry products make up the next largest 
hvp category led by undressed fur skins 
highvalue grain and feed products which have posted an 
annual growth rate of 8 percent since 1980 also show potential for 
further growth glynn said leading product groups are 
starchinulingluten products prepared breakfast food and bread 
biscuits and cake 
there is a potential also for fast foods such as frozen and 
microwavable products and for foods with a short preparation time 
although the outlook for trade appears good labeling 
requirements continue to present possible constraints he said 
canada uses the metric system and metric weights and measures 
must be stated on the labels of all prepackaged consumer products 
for example sliced bacon must be marketed in 500gram packages 
onepound packages 454 grams are not allowed 
bilingual labeling is required for almost all consumer food 
products entering canada glynn said french is one of the two 
official languages in canada and is the principal language in many 
of the large urban areas of eastern canada 
the new uscanada free trade agreement is expected to open 
the doors to wider markets on both sides of the border he said 
if the pact is approved by both nations all tariff and some 
nontariff barriers to agricultural trade will be eliminated over 
the next 10 years 
but glynn said that even with the new trade pact some 
constraints will exist particularly for highvalue products 
for example although discriminatory price markups on us wines 
will be eliminated the sale of alcoholic beverages will remain 
under the control of the sovereign provincial monopolies he said 
each of those boards has its own set of rules and regulations that 
affect liquor products sold in their jurisdictions 
also us fresh fruits and vegetables could continue to face 
seasonal restrictions because of a snapback provision in the 
pact which allows either country to apply tariffs for up to 180 
days a year under certain price and production conditions glynn 
said

the agriculture department removed some of the 
red tape hampering shipment of certain genetically engineered 
organisms from one state to another 
as a result the department will allow the material to be moved 
interstate between research facilities without a permit 
james w glosser acting administrator of the departments 
animal and plant health inspection service said thursday agency 
scientists found the commonly used laboratory organisms when 
properly packaged pose no risk to people plants animals or the 
environment 
shippers must still follow conditions outlined by the agency 
however and the organisms must not contain genetic sequences 
that would allow them to invade or damage plants 
the exempted laboratory microorganisms were escherichia coli 
genotype k12 and its derivatives sterile strains of saccharomyces 
cerevisiae or asporogenic nonspore forming strains of bacillus 
subtilis 
the microorganisms being exempted are not only nontoxic but 
cannot survive outside of carefully controlled laboratory 
conditions glosser said therefore in case of an accidental spill 
during transport the organisms would perish and could not cause any 
danger 
glosser said the national institutes of health which 
administers guidelines for genetic engineering research also has 
excluded these organisms from risk categories that require special 
containment

eight in 10 american smokers believe that 
passive cigarette smoke is harmful and nearly half say theyve 
found others smoke to be annoying according to a government 
survey 
eightyeight percent of the americans over 16 who were 
questioned in the federal governments 1986 tobaccouse surveys 
said they considered smoke from the cigarettes of others to be 
generally harmful to health the national centers for disease 
control reported thursday 
the survey also found that 79 percent of all respondents 
including 43 percent of smokers said they were annoyed by others 
cigarette smoke 
and 61 percent of all respondents including 14 percent of the 
smokers said that when given a choice they sit in the 
nonsmoking sections of restaurants airplanes and other public 
places 
these data indicate that a large percentage of smokers and 
nonsmokers regard passive smoking as a health hazard the cdc 
said in its report in addition a majority of nonsmokers and 
almost half of current smokers are annoyed 
the survey among 13031 people was conducted before surgeon 
general c everett koops landmark report warning of the effects of 
passive smoking was released at the end of 1986 
if it were repeated the awareness and distaste for passive 
smoking would probably be even higher said dr thomas novotny of 
the us office on smoking and health the cdc department that 
conducted the survey 
the surveys margin of sampling error is believed to be no more 
than 2 percentage points novotny said 
the findings were up noticeably from a poll conducted by the 
roper organization in 1978 which found that 58 percent of 
americans believed passive smoking was hazardous the cdc noted 
other findings from the governments 1986 survey 
82 percent of those who never smoked pick nosmoking sections 
in planes and restaurants compared with 69 percent of former 
smokers 
75 percent of smokers said passive smoke was very or 
somewhat harmful rather than slightly or not at all 
69 percent of those who never smoked or had quit said passive 
smoking was harmful to their own health not just in general 
42 percent of all working respondents said their workplaces 
have restricted smoking and 53 percent of them said they were 
nonetheless still exposed to passive smoking in the workplace

tennis star ivan lendl has moved a giant step 
closer to his dream of playing for the us olympic team in seoul 
this summer winning a crucial set from a skeptical congress 
the house judiciary immigration subcommittee which last year 
vowed to avoid speeding up grants of citizenship to athletes hoping 
to compete in the olympics did just that thursday for lendl and 
two lesserknown hopefuls 
lendl wants congress to lift the mandatory fiveyear waiting 
period immigrants with permanent resident status must go through 
before receiving full citizenship the czech native who lives in 
greenwich conn and has adopted the united states as his home 
cannot represent the united states in the olympics without 
citizenship 
ivan lendl deserves the opportunity to compete as a citizen of 
his adopted country and we as american citizens deserve to have 
him represent us rep christopher shays rconn told the 
panel lendl is ranked no 1 in the world 
rep romano l mazzoli dky the subcommittee chairman 
usually opposes such bills but he said he was sympathetic to 
arguments that preventing lendls participation would be a true 
hardship because his prime years are so limited 
still mazzoli said he was concerned that expedited citizenship 
would not automatically make lendl eligible for the us team 
ronald t rowan general counsel of the us olympic committee 
said that under international tennis federation rules a player 
first must represent his country in the davis cup before the 
olympics 
but federation rules also say that lendl needs a special waiver 
to play for the united states in the davis cup since he has 
previously represented his native czechoslovakia in those games 
the next davis cup is in july 
the olympics which will be held in seoul from sept 17 through 
oct 2 will have tennis as a full sport for the first time since 
1924 it was a trial sport in 1984 modified olympic rules will 
allow professional tennis players such as lendl to compete 
the lendl bill which even proponents had given little chance of 
passage earlier this year was approved without opposition and sent 
to the house judiciary committee 
the subcommittee also approved citizenship bills for jenspeter 
burntd an east german swimmer who defected in 1985 and is living 
in alabama and gagik barseghian an armenian wrestler who moved to 
california in 1986 
assuming it passes the house the legislation still could face 
serious obstacles in the senate sen edward m kennedy dmass 
mazzolis senate counterpart remains wary of olympic exemptions 
sen lowell p weicker jr rconn an avid tennis fan and fellow 
greenwich resident is expected to lead the senate fight 
lendl 28 moved to connecticut in 1981 and received his 
permanent resident status last year lendl who is at the monte 
carlo open was in washington last week to personally lobby

a drift in the prevailing influenza viruses 
circulating over the winter has prompted federal health officials 
to recommend changes in next winters flu vaccine 
the us public health service called thursday for an alteration 
in the nations recommended flu vaccine to better protect against 
two viruses that drifted or began changing into different 
forms in the 198788 flu season 
the 198788 flu vaccine as is customary contained protection 
against the three major types of flu which researchers know as 
type ah3n2 type ah1n1 and type b 
specifically the vaccine was tailored to guard against an 
ah3n2 strain known as the leningrad flu an ah1n1 strain known as 
the taiwan flu and a b strain known as the ann arbor flu 
but late last year as the winter flu season began in this 
country and the vaccine was administered us centers for disease 
control researchers reported evidence of a drift in the ah3n2 
virus toward a different form 
researchers later said they had identified four ah3n2 strains 
circulating in the united states one of those four strains known 
as the sichuan flu should be included in the 198889 flu vaccine 
the public health service recommended in thursdays cdc weekly 
report 
meanwhile although type b flu was seen less frequently than 
type ah3n2 in the united states last winter it has become 
clear that a drift in that flu too has occurred the public 
health service is thus recommending a different b strain the 
victoria flu be included in next winters vaccine 
for its third component the vaccine should again include last 
years recommended ah1n1 strain the taiwan flu the cdc reported 
cdc researchers say such variations in flu viruses are not 
uncommon the agency recommends flu vaccine particularly for older 
people and those who might be prone to severe complications from 
the flu 
there are indications that the 198788 flu season continues to 
wind down the cdc said only two states hawaii and new hampshire 
last week reported widespread outbreaks of flulike illness 
with reports from areas containing at least half the states 
population 
five others california connecticut illinois north dakota 
and vermont reported less severe regional outbreaks the cdc 
said 
to gauge the effects of the flu season cdc researchers measure 
the number of deaths from pneumonia and flu in selected cities 
against the standard for the time of year that index has been 
above the epidemic threshold for nine weeks said dr suzanne 
gaventa a cdc flu specialist

states must provide new programs for 
bluecollar workers in computer and math broadening old notions of 
literacy to ensure workers can compete in an increasingly 
technological economy says a report by the state of michigan and 
international business machines corp 
economic change has redefined literacy michigan gov 
blanchard said thursday at a news conference releasing the report 
for example he said workers in auto plants and other factories 
must be able to understand computer manuals and perform other tasks 
far removed from traditional jobs such as putting a nut on a bolt 
the report said reading and writing are no longer sufficient 
skills for a worker to get a job and it proposed programs that any 
state could use to develop the math computer and teamwork skills 
of workers 
the report also recommended creation of standard ways to assess 
worker skills coordinate training programs and make access to such 
training programs easier 
fully 15 percent to 20 percent of adults in the united states 
lack the skills needed to get and keep jobs blanchard said in 
michigan as many as 13 million adults lack the skills needed to 
work in the new economy he said 
the report said 30 percent of new jobs created in michigan by 
the end of the century will require at least four years of college 
a level of education attained by only 17 percent of the workers in 
the state 
the report said 22 percent of new jobs will require from one to 
three years of college a level reached by only 20 percent of the 
workers in the state 
at the other end of the scale the 40 percent of the workers 
having only a high school education will be competing for 34 
percent of the jobs and the 16 percent that dropped out of high 
school will be competing for 10 percent of the jobs 
the michigan plan would require little new money and would 
largely draw on the 500 million a year now spent for training and 
retraining blanchard said

the occupational hazard of aids in health care 
workers remains small although there are more unexplained cases 
among those workers than among other americans government health 
researchers say 
the national centers for disease control reported thursday that 
2586 health care workers are known to be among the more than 
50000 americans who have contracted aids 
while only 28 percent of the nations other aids patients are 
classified as having gotten the disease in an undetermined 
manner nearly twice as many of the health care workers with aids 
are so characterized 53 percent or 135 in all the cdc said 
health care workers make up 54 percent of the known us aids 
patients and a similar percentage of the us population at large 
57 percent 
more than a dozen health care workers are documented to have 
been infected with the virus that causes aids as a result of their 
work usually by being pricked accidentally by a needle carrying 
contaminated blood one health care worker is known to have gone on 
to develop the deadly disease itself after he was infected in such 
a manner 
scientific studies in which health workers are enrolled and then 
followed to assess their risk of aids infection have shown that the 
chance of being infected after a needlestick exposure to blood 
from infected patients is less than 1 percent the atlantabased 
cdc said 
that data has not changed at all in continuing 
studiessaid dr mary chamberland a cdc aids specialist the 
risk is still regarded as low 
the reasons for the higher number of undetermined cases among 
health care workers could include patients failure to report 
homosexual activity drug use and other risk factors or the 
occupational risk of aids infection as a result of blood 
exposure or both the cdc said 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome most often strikes 
homosexual men and intravenous drug abusers and also is spread 
less frequently through heterosexual contact or blood transfusions 
the failure of aids patients to disclose behavior that might 
have put them at risk is something researchers consider when 
looking at undetermined risk ms chamberland said 
or we may be seeing some occupational transmission in the 
health care setting she added its difficult to establish 
with certainty how transmission occurred 
while most us health care workers with aids were infected 
outside their jobs a small number of healthcare workers have 
been infected through occupational exposures the cdc noted 
in its weekly report 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome has struck 59491 
people in the united states and has so far killed 33280 of them 
according to statistics this week from the cdc

east asias newlyprosperous trading countries 
dislike being lumped together but growing interdependence means 
they and other pacific rim nations should organize a regional 
economic framework congress was told 
the entire pacific region now requires a mechanism for 
multilateral economic consultations because it has become one 
of the most interdependent areas of the world and in the next 
century will have the largest impact of any region on the global 
economy said richard m fairbanks iii president of the us 
national committee for pacific economic cooperation 
fairbanks group is an organization of us government business 
and academic specialists on trade focusing on pacific issues 
pacific trade tensions are managed primarily by means of a 
growing tangle of bilateral dialogues whose inefficiencies have 
begun to work against us fairbanks said thursday 
disputes between the united states and south korea taiwan hong 
kong and singapore the socalled four dragons or tigers 
show the region is part of a complex multilateral system in which 
not all the parts are adequately communicating with one another 
he said all four have large trade surpluses with the united states 
for example south korea as a key political and military ally 
of the united states would be more willing to rapidly revalue 
appreciate its currency and liberalize imports if it could be 
more certain that such measures would benefit the us fairbanks 
said as it is however korea expects japan and the other 
newlyindustrialized countries would be the primary 
beneficiaries he said 
rep robert garcia chairman of the house banking finance and 
urban affairs subcommittee asked whether more asian representation 
was warranted in the organization of economic cooperation and 
development made up of the two dozen wealthiest industrial 
countries mostly european and north american 
some have earned a place at the table replied robert d 
hormats vice chairman of goldman sachs international a major 
usbased underwriting firm

vice president george bush and his wife 
barbara paid 86684 in 1987 income taxes slightly more than the 
amount paid by president reagan and his wife nancy 
however the bushes paid the taxes on 36963 less income 
according to tax return released wednesday george and barbara 
bush paid taxes equivalent to 28 percent of their total income of 
308396 by contrast the reagans paid 86638 in taxes on total 
income of 345349 or 25 percent 
both the president and the man who will be the 1988 republican 
presidential nominee benefited under new taxlaw changes although 
reagan clearly benefited the most 
in 1986 the bushes had paid taxes of 115486 on income of 
348594 or 33 percent the reagans 1986 tax bill came to 
92460 on total income of 336649 or 275 percent 
the bulk of bushs income came from his 114681 in salary plus 
other reimbursements as vice president and from 169600 from the 
blind trust set up when he took office in 1981 
this trust included 26075 in capital gains 31264 in 
interest and dividends and 112261 in other income 
details were not disclosed under terms of the blind trust aides 
have said previously that the trust is valued at about 1 million 
bush also reported 20773 in passive income from his 
interest in a liquefied natural gas barge 1575 in royalties on 
his book looking forward and 66 in interest on his account 
in the white house credit union 
bushs salary was up from the 97900 he received in 1986 
reflecting a general raise in federal salaries even though his 
overall income was down 
the main reason for the lower gross income a much lower level 
of capital gains the income derived from the sale of assets 
property or stock 
in 1986 bush reported total capital gains of 430165 
apparently reflecting a decision by the trustees of his blind trust 
to sell off assets before the new taxlaw changes took effect last 
jan 1 which increased the tax on capital gains to 28 percent for 
1987 
before then not all capital gains were reported as income this 
resulted in a maximum total tax of 20 percent on such gains 
bush has made return to a lower rate of taxation on capital 
gains a major campaign theme claiming the decision to tax capital 
gains at generally the same rate as other earnings stifles business 
investment 
bush has proposed a capital gains tax of no more than 15 percent 
the bushes claimed total deductions for 1987 of 53314 
including 12225 in contributions to 35 charities the largest 
were three 1000 gifts to the yale alumni fund the united negro 
college fund and to the combined federal campaign united way 
bush graduated from yale in 1948 
bush had 32588 withheld from his salary and made an additonal 
57000 in advance payments suggesting a refund of 2904 
however the vice president elected to have this money held and 
applied to his 1988 taxes 
bush claimed 3574 in business meals and entertainment and 
another 6880 in miscellaneous business deductions he paid 700 
to have the tax return prepared by a houston accounting firm 
the vice president has released his tax returns annually in 
addition he released 14 years in previous returns last january 
during the heat of his campaign with thenrival sen bob dole who 
has since withdrawn from the race for the gop presidential 
nomination 
those returns showed that 1986 was and still is his biggest 
income year and that over the 14year period he paid taxes ranging 
from 3 percent to 41 percent of his annual income 
the internal revenue service estimates that by next year when 
the taxlaw changes are fully phased in about threequarters of 
all americans will have smaller proportional tax bills than they 
had in 1986

president reagan joked about books by exaides 
and his own mental faculties but grew serious in his farewell to 
the white house press corps when he turned to his seven years of 
friction with the media 
what i hope my epitaph will be with the white house 
correspondents what every presidents epitaph should be is he 
gave as good as he got reagan told the white house 
correspondents association dinner on thursday 
that i think makes for a healthy press and a healthy 
presidency he said in his seventh and last appearance at the 
dinner an annual affair where reporters and public officials set 
aside hostilities for a night and toast each other alongside 
invited celebrities 
reagan his wife nancy seated beside him also noted the furor 
over recent critical books by longtime aides such as former 
presidential spokesman larry speakes and former deputy white house 
chief of staff michael deaver 
this looks like the index to larry speakes book said 
reagan as he looked out over the crowd 
speakes had accepted an invitation to the dinner from the 
washington post but withdrew last week in the wake of stories 
about his book 
even white house chief of staff howard baker is writing a 
book its going to be called three by five the measure of a 
president he said referring to his use of index cards in 
meetings 
mike deaver said i have a short attention span he said i 
was going to reply to that but what the hell lets move on to 
something else 
and joking about the frequent complaints that he does not hold 
enough meetings with the press he said the presidential campaign 
has left him feeling a little lonely 
with everyone following the presidential campaign ive been 
feeling a little bit lonely ive been so desperate for attention 
i almost considered holding a news conference reagan said 
drawing his biggest laugh from the reporters 
he got a more sober reaction when he noted the media criticism 
of his administration 
every president will try to use the press to his best 
advantage he said but the press is not a weak sister that 
needs bracing the press can take care of itself and a president 
should be able to take care of himself as well 
in keeping with the ceasefire spirit of the evening reagan 
applauded and shook hands with seven reporters who got awards for 
white house coverage that included several articles about problems 
in his administration in the past year 
the reporters used the evening to issue their traditional 
invitations to celebrities from motion pictures and supermarket 
tabloids causing problems when photographers shoved past members 
of congress and cabinet members to get pictures

indictments against 10 men will not 
repair the shattered life of a 19yearold woman who remains in 
hiding with her family since she reported being abducted and 
gangraped last month friends say 
they have to get out of san diego said richard yaeger a 
friend of the victim and her 23yearold husband in this southern 
texas town of 5000 where many residents are related theyll 
never be able to come back here 
a grand jury indicted 10 men thursday on charges including 
sexual assault and aggravated kidnapping 
the couple and their two children ages 16 months and four 
months have lived in a secret location in corpus christi since 
shortly after she reported the march 26 incident yaeger said 
some of the defendants have said the victim was a willing 
participant and yaeger said the victim and her family have 
received threats for reporting the incident to authorities 
the young mother returned to san diego to testify before the 
grand jury thursday and was led out of the courthouse with her 
head and face covered by a black shawl 
the woman said the fourhour series of assaults began at an 
illegal cockfight at a ranch and continued at two other locations 
bystanders ignored her pleas for help and some joined her 
attackers she said 
since news of the incident however wellwishers donated more 
than 8000 to the family and the unemployed husband received a 
job offer said dot barnette of crisis services in corpus christi 
i would say that the response from the community has been 
fantastic particularly with individuals ms barnette said 
the 10 men who were indicted were arrested within days of the 
attack and will be rearrested said rodolfo gutierrez a duval 
county assistant district attorney 
bonds for each sexual assault charge were set at 50000 bonds 
for each kidnapping charge were set at 100000

a poem by anyone other than 
shakespeare might not scan as sweet but scholars are turning up 
their noses at reports of previously unpublished verse by the bard 
in a california library 
the poem pasted onto the back of a manuscript volume in 
huntington library here was discovered in december 1986 by an 
oxford university researcher and published for the first time today 
in the london newspaper the independent 
its possible certainly said sara hodson associate 
curator of literary manuscripts at the library one of the most 
prestigious in the west but then again we will want to wait and 
see the evidence on which the attribution is being made 
the researcher peter levi came across the 14verse poem while 
working on a biography of the 16th and early 17thcentury poet and 
playwright the daily telegraph in london reported thursday 
levi brooded on his find for a year told his british 
publishers macmillan publishers ltd and showed the verses to 
colleagues according to the independent 
but the report by the papers literary editor sebastian faulks 
said the decision to attribute the verses to shakespeare was levis 
own it quoted him as saying i have thought about these lines 
for a long time and i dont see how they can not be by 
shakespeare 
macmillans chairman lord stockton told the daily telegraph 
levi has to his satisfaction and i think to the satisfaction of a 
lot of other people and certainly to us authenticated this as 
poetry penned by big bill 
however faulks said levi was not absolutely certain that 
shakespeare wrote the poem 
the 14 short verses were intended to be spoken at a betrothal 
party for anne the eldest daughter of the dowager countess alice 
of derby the independent said the name of the planned speaker was 
written before each verse and levi is believed to have used the 
names as keys in his literary detective work the new york times 
reported today 
macmillan said levi will hold a news conference in london on 
monday but declined comment on what will be revealed repeated 
calls by the associated press to levis home in stonesfield near 
oxford went unanswered 
however stanley wells professor of shakespeare studies at the 
university of birmingham was quoted as telling the daily telegraph 
that scholars who have examined the poem had little doubt that 
these verses were written not by shakespeare but by someone else 
hallett smith senior research associate at the library also 
said it was unlikely the work was written by shakespeare 
smith who had not studied the disputed poem said no 
significant shakespearean literary creations have ever been 
uncovered apart from the main body of his work 
ms hodson added that this isnt the first time someone has 
suggested that the work might have been written by shakespeare 
it has been in the library since 1917 and looked at by many 
scholars in all those years she said at least one other 
scholar and probably more have wondered about the shakespeare 
connection 
it is difficult to decipher the contents of the poem because it 
is scrawled in poor handwriting ms hodson said there are 
initials at the bottom that could either be interpreted as wsh 
or wsk 
the daily telegraph said the poem will be published monday in a 
28page booklet produced in secrecy by macmillan a private 
commission new verse by shakespeare two days after the 424th 
anniversary of shakespeares birth 
in 1985 a love poem found in oxford universitys bodleian 
library and attributed to shakespeare by american scholar gary 
taylor drew bad marks from other scholars who said it could not 
have been shakespeares work 
ms hodson said the levi poem is written on two sheets of paper 
pasted inside the back cover of a manuscript volume containing a 
play by english dramatist john marston who lived from 1575 to 1634 
shakespeare lived from about 1564 to 1616 
neither the marston play nor the poem attributed to shakespeare 
is marked with a date but handwriting paper watermarks and the 
binding have been used to date the manuscripts to the 17th century 
ms hodson explained 
the huntington collection has 25 million manuscripts including 
several of the most important manuscripts by chaucer ms hodson 
said

gunmen eluded a huge police manhunt 
early today after fleeing his resort town with three hostages 
following a botched robbery and 24hour siege in which five people 
were killed and 42 held captive 
all hostages were later freed 
unconfirmed local press reports said the robbers took about 
13000 in bank money carlos cano a policeman participating in 
the hunt confirmed some money was taken but declined to say how 
much 
about 500 police and army personnel backed by a helicopter 
searched for the seven young men thursday night and police set up 
blockades on highways leading out of the city 
the gunmen must have gone to the sierra where it will be 
difficult to locate them said cano referring to the nearby 
sierra madre mountain range 
the gunmen had holed up inside the local offices of the national 
bank of mexico after the foiled robbery they let their 42 hostages 
go thursday and were permitted to flee in an armored car with three 
red cross workers 
police said the robbers released the red cross workers 15 
minutes later when they abandoned the armored car at a gas station 
and took off in a stolen pickup truck and station wagon 
one of the red cross workers rosario angulo said there were 
only five gunmen in the armored car which he was forced to drive 
angulo said one of his captors had an arm wound 
i think the other two mixed in among the crowd at the moment 
of leaving the bank he said most police officers had withdrawn 
from around the bank just before the seven men left apparently as 
part of an agreement ending the standoff 
angulo said the robbers strapped sticks of dynamite to their 
bodies and toted sawedoff machine guns he said the men were calm 
angulo and the other two red cross hostages were unhurt 
mexican authorities routinely patrol the rugged sierra madre in 
search of marijuana and opium poppy plantations and clandestine 
airstrips used by drug traffickers 
gov francisco labastida ochoa of sinaloa state told the 
televisa tv network thursday that the release agreement allowed 
police to pursue the gunmen 
were not deceiving anyone the governor said we simply 
reached an agreement in which we could safeguard lives 
ignacio lara a spokesman for the governor said the gunmen 
demanded earlier that they be allowed to leave by air police said 
the robbers were in their late teens or early 20s and had no 
political motives 
the standoff in los mochis a town of 120000 on the gulf of 
california about 500 miles south of tucson ariz began at 1245 
pm wednesday when the gunmen took hostages after an alarm alerted 
police there was a robbery in progress 
red cross spokesmen said five people were killed and at least 15 
wounded during the attempted robbery and ensuing siege after 
hundreds of police surrounded the bank 
spokesman jesus acosta of the local red cross said one of its 
rescue workers was among those killed in a gunfight wednesday 
between police and the robbers 
he said the others slain were a customer bank official and 
teller and a policeman who was in the bank on business at the time 
of the robbery and tried to prevent it 
the wife of one hostage said her husband farmworker juan jose 
terraza 29 was seriously wounded during the gunfight and was in 
grave condition at a local hospital he only wanted to cash a 
check inside the bank she said 
bank robberies and other kinds of crime have increased 
significantly in mexico since 1982 when an economic crisis began 
to eat away purchasing power and drive up unemployment 
sinaloa is known as a center for crime especially of the type 
linked to the illegal drug trade

the chairman of the house armed services 
committee says the united states may have overreacted by attacking 
iranian oil platforms in retaliation for mines laid in the persian 
gulf 
we may have shot ourselves in the foot said rep les aspin 
dwis there is good reason to suspect that the mines that 
prompted mondays retaliation were not laid by tehran authorities 
but by some iranian radicals looking to start a fight 
our restrained policy in the gulf worked superbly until now 
aspin said in remarks prepared for delivery today 
we had shown sufficient force to convince iran to back off 
without reacting so bloodily as to generate the martyrs that the 
iranian radicals use to inflame public passions he said 
meanwhile the senate is headed for another fight over invoking 
the war powers act for president reagans persian gulf policy but 
even a prime supporter says hes unsure of what the effort will 
accomplish 
im not sure it will do any good sen brock adams dwash 
said thursday but adams said he plans to push anyway for invoking 
the 1973 law because it is on the books and thus should be followed 
the consequences of selective observance of the law are truly 
frightening said adams who tried unsuccessfully for two months 
last year to win senate approval of a war powers resolution 
adams also says he plans to introduce a bill authorizing the 
continued deployment of navy ships in the persian gulf 
i am not trying to force the withdrawal of american forces 
said adams we have a right to be there and have a mission to 
perform there 
adams said he wants congress to take a stand on reagans 
10monthold policy of reflagging 11 kuwaiti tankers and protecting 
them with navy convoys 
we are abrogating our obligation under the constitution and we 
are abrogating our responsibility under the law he said 
adams has been one of the senates strongest backers of invoking 
the war powers act the vietnamera law limiting a presidents 
authority to commit us personnel to situations of imminent 
danger 
under some circumstances the law requires withdrawal of the 
troops after 60 days unless congress votes to let them remain 
reagan has asserted the measure is an unconstitutional limit on his 
authority and he has refused to trigger its provisions for his gulf 
policy 
aspins remarks were his first major comment on mondays clashes 
in which us navy ships destroyed two iranian oil platforms in the 
southern gulf afterward iranian ships attacked navy forces and 
the navy responded by sinking or damaging six iranian ships 
administration officials said the us strikes at the platforms 
were retaliation for last weeks mining of the frigate uss samuel 
b roberts ten sailors were injured and the ship was nearly sunk 
when the vessel hit a mine the administration said was laid by iran 
according to aspin ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis regime 
reevaluated its persian gulf policy in january and decided not 
to confront the united states any more 
there is good reason to suspect that some irate iranian 
radicals decided to light a fire in the persian gulf he said 
he said it would not take more than a handful of revolutionary 
guards to drop some mines in the gulf sea lanes and cause a 
return to the glorious confrontational days of yore

sinking land and rising seas will cause 
egyptian lands where more than a million people now live to be 
covered by water over the next century a smithsonian institution 
researcher reports in a study published today 
daniel j stanley senior oceanographer at the smithsonians 
national museum of natural history said in an article in science 
that by the year 2100 the mediterranean sea will cause major 
flooding of the nile river delta land between port said on the suez 
canal and the damietta branch of the nile 
the sea is cutting back the shoreline now at the rate of 50 to 
100 feet a year in some areas said stanley the sea is acting 
like a saw and grinding away at the soils and sediments in the 
area 
i see it as a very serious problem eventually he added 
some dry land now more than 20 miles from the shoreline could be 
covered by up to three feet of sea water by the end of the next 
century stanley said much of this land now is used to grow crops 
the seawater invasion is being caused by the action of three 
forces the scientist said 
first is the rise of the sea itself stanley said sea level is 
climbing in the northeastern nile delta at the rate of about 1 
feet a century the second factor is that the ground in the area is 
sinking at about the same rate the third factor is the aswan dam 
on the nile river 
based on corings of the sediment in the area it appears the 
land subsidence and the rise in sea level rise have been under way 
for about 7500 years in the nile delta stanley said the loss in 
land was kept in check however by tons of sediment washed down 
the nile river every year the sediment collected along the 
shoreline allowing the land to maintain its relative position to 
the sea 
but in 1964 the aswan dam on the nile was closed and the 
sediment was blocked instead of being deposited on the shore the 
sediment now is collecting in lake nassar in back of the dam 
without this sediment the shoreline of the delta began to wash 
away 
on a yeartoyear basis the effects will only be marginally 
felt said stanley but over decades you will see a changing 
position of the water level 
he said the fresh ground water in the area is slowly being 
tainted by saline sea water this he said could seriously affect 
egyptian efforts to develop agriculture irrigation and industry in 
the area 
this is sort of the breadbasket of egypt said stanley 
the most serious ramifications are to the agriculture 
about a million people now live in areas that will be flooded by 
the year 2100 stanley said port said a major city at the 
northern end of the suez canal is in the threatened area so are 
important farming and industrial projects the researcher said the 
canal itself probably will not be affected

us officials say they are 
frustrated over their inability to catch the mysterious intruders 
who reportedly penetrated american military installations near the 
panama canal twice this week 
the incidents tuesday and wednesday nights brought to four the 
number of intrusions at american military facilities reported by 
the us southern command in the past two weeks all were termed 
serious 
neither the panamanian government nor the panamanian defense 
forces commented on this weeks incidents last week they ridiculed 
us accounts of intrusions saying the marines apparently fired at 
swaying palm trees 
the command said thursday that no casualties were reported in 
the latest intrusions it said that an army patrol detonated two 
claymore mines to scare off one group of about 30 men and an army 
sentry drew gunfire in another case 
if we could get our hands on one of them wed know what were 
dealing with its frustrating said bill ormsby a civilian 
spokesman for the command 
they are highly trained professionals who are trying to elicit 
a reaction through intimidation through harassment he added 
in washington last week the defense departments chief 
spokesman dan howard suggested to reporters that the first 
intrusion on april 11 was carried out by panamanian military 
personnel commanded by gen manuel antonio noriega 
noriega panamas strongman has headed the defense forces since 
1983 he is under us indictment on drug trafficking charges he 
has rejected the charges the reagan administration has sought his 
ouster for months as has a growing internal opposition 
howard and the southern command acknowledged thursday they have 
no hard evidence to identify those intruders or the ones on april 
12 or the latest two reported incidents 
i wouldnt want to speculate that its even the same people 
said lt cmdr gregg hartung another command spokesman one 
thing we do know theyre good highly professional 
a marine was killed april 11 when fellow guards accidentally 
shot him while trying to surround what they described as a group of 
eight intruders at a fuel storage depot near howard air force base 
the next night about 100 marines said they exchanged small arms 
fire and fired three mortar rounds at intruders numbering from 40 
to 50 at the same place the 807acre arraijan tank farm 
hartung said that on tuesday night a sentry tried to halt three 
men near a fence surrounding an army munitions depot near the 
rodman naval station 
he said one intruder fired a revolver at the guard who returned 
fire and called for help the intruder fired at least one more shot 
at the guard then fled with his companions before a 12man marine 
quick reaction team arrived hartung said 
he said the gunman apparently crawled through a culvert under a 
security fence surrounding the ammunition dump while his two 
companions stayed on the other side 
but all three were well inside us defense territory 
hartung said they were only about 75 meters away nearly 250 
feet in an area partially illuminated by security lights and we 
think he the guard got a good look at them 
hartung said the guard reported all three wore camouflage 
uniforms with one wearing a lightcolored beret and the others 
bush hats he identified the guard only as a specialist 4th 
class with the 154th signal battalion which is permanently based 
in panama 
on wednesday hartung said a threeman reconnaisance team from 
the 193rd light infantry brigade spotted about 30 intruders in a 
hilly jungled area 1 miles west of the main runway of howard base 
at 8 pm 
hartung said the soldiers set off two claymore mines by remote 
control apparently scaring the intruders away before an army quick 
reaction team arrived he said the reconnaissance team was not on 
guard duty but declined to say why they were in the area 
he said the mine blasts were not an attempt to harm the 
intruders but to create a diversion 
hartung also said the soldiers did not fire their m16 automatic 
rifles so as not to give away their position 
the army munitions depot the fuel storage area and the air base 
are within a few miles of each other just outside panama city on 
the pacific ocean end of the canal 
hartung and ormsby said an exhaustive sweep of the fuel storage 
depot failed to turn up proof of the intruders identity 
however the southern command said in a statement that a 
limited amount of circumstantial physical evidence was found to 
support marine claims that they were engaged in a firefight 
it said the evidence included two bottles of insect repellant 
not used by us forces a first aid bandage and a blackcolored 
handerchief it said no shell casings were recovered

riot troops broke up the second 
antiamerican demonstration in this capital in as many weeks 
hurling tear gas grenades and firing into the air to stop about 200 
protesters headed for the us embassy 
at least one person was arrested there were no immediate 
reports of injuries 
the protesters chanting embassy embassy had been part of 
a crowd of about 2000 people who marched peacefully to the 
national congress earlier thursday to demonstrate against the 
honduran government and us policy in the central american country 
five people were killed during a riot april 7 in which about 
2000 demonstrators sacked and burned the us consulate and 
offices of the us information service those protesters were 
angered over the deportation to the united states of a honduran man 
accused of drug trafficking 
about 50 riot police and army troops threw tear gas grenades 
into the 200 demonstrators as they advanced on the us diplomatic 
mission thursday night 
the tear gas dispersed the protesters momentarily but they 
regrouped cutting off a small contingent of what appeared to be 
young and illtrained troops who shot long bursts of fire from 
their m16s into the air the sound of shots sparked panic in the 
neighborhood 
some demonstrators taunted the troops and threw stones at the 
soldiers who at intervals advanced behind metal shields 
during the milelong march earlier thursday protesters chanted 
slogans calling for the expulsion of the approximately 1100 us 
troops based in honduras the removal of usbacked nicaraguan 
rebels from honduras and the defense of the honduran constitution 
they condemned the government of president jose azcona hoyo and 
what they called his subservience to washington honduras is the 
united states staunchest ally in central america 
yankee garbage out of honduras and if the yankees dont 
get out in honduras they will die shouted the demonstrators 
the marchers most of them students walked to the national 
congress where they listened to speeches condemning azcona and the 
united states 
about 500 demonstrators proceeded from there to the nearby 
central penitentiary where they shouted for the release of inmates 
they consider political prisoners 
a group then tried to go to the us embassy 
one of the issues the marchers protested was the forced 
extradition of juan ramon matta honduran police working with us 
agents arrested matta at his tegucigalpa home on april 5 and had 
him flown to the united states 
the honduran constitution prohibits the extradition of honduran 
citizens 
matta is in federal prison in marion ill awaiting trial on 
drug trafficking charges matta is also wanted for questioning in 
the 1985 tortureslaying in mexico of us drug enforcement 
administration agent enrique camarena salazar 
the us embassy estimates damage to the consulate building in 
the april 7 riot at between 4 million and 6 million and has asked 
for reimbursement from the honduran government

a premature newborn chimpanzee named lilly is 
alive today thanks to volunteer pediatric specialists who brought 
their hospital skills to an animalcare nursery 
i think the no 1 thing was that it sounded like they needed 
some help said dr lance wyble of the neonatal unit at tampa 
general hospital also i felt it would be a challenge the 
veterinarian wasnt too familiar with the situation and i was very 
familiar with it the whole thing had a lot of appeal 
wyble two nurses and a respiratory therapist from the hospital 
and a blood bank doctor teamed up with busch gardens veterinarian 
john olson here three weeks ago to save the 2pound primate 
today lilly seems to winning her battle to survive the chimp 
is out of intensive care and shes alert and is taking formula on 
her own although she still has a stomach tube for feeding 
the medical team is following the chimp for any developing 
problems anemia or episodes of failed breathing 
shes still got a long ways to go wyble said thursday 
night were looking for evidence of good weight gain thats 
the ultimate proof that everything is going well 
the medical team twice had to revive lilly when breathing 
stopped and her heart rate fell dramatically 
they also ran intravenous fluids attached monitoring equipment 
hooked up oxygen injected antibiotics inserted feeding tubes 
tested blood gases and gave transfusions 
i felt like i was at work thats how critical it was she was 
dying said nurse peggy herman 
after the first 15 minutes you forgot it was an ape and could 
see how much she was like one of our babies said the other 
nurse kathy arnold 
its so neat to be able to use your experience and background 
to help another species she said it wasnt like lilly was 
weird she was just like a baby shed grasp your finger want to 
cling whimper when you start an iv 
ms herman a criticalcare nurse for nearly 15 years ms 
arnold with 10 years in nursing and respiration therapist bob 
tursi volunteered their help 
the chimpanzee was born march 31 at busch gardens a wildlife 
and amusement park that is home to 334 species of animals olson 
said he thinks lilly was born two to three weeks short of the 
normal 7month gestation period

a study found there is a onein50 million chance 
of getting the aids virus in a single sexual encounter with someone 
who doesnt know whether he is infected but is not considered 
highrisk and uses a condom 
that compares with a onein10000 to onein100000 chance of 
getting the virus from the same type of encounter with a person who 
is in a highrisk group said the study reported in todays 
journal of the american medical association 
highrisk partners are people who anytime within the past 10 
years have had male homosexual contact shared intravenous drug 
needles lived in haiti or central africa or received multiple 
blood products the study said 
using condoms lowers risk of getting aids about 10fold 
regardless of other factors said the study relying on a lab test 
that establishes ones sexual partner as free of the aids virus 
lessens risk about 100fold 
the study also found that aidsprevention campaigns may mislead 
the public when they stress condom use and fewer sexual partners 
over another strategy a cautious courtship in search of a 
lowrisk lover 
choosing a partner who is known to have little chance of 
carrying the aids virus reduces the risk of infection by as much as 
5000 times compared with the risk of engaging in sex with a 
highrisk person the study said 
a knowledge of where the largest risks occur should lead people 
to move toward gradual courtships to listen carefully for clues 
about a potential partners past and to ask directly about any 
history of highrisk activities the study said 
were not saying throw away your condoms said dr norman 
hearst one of the studys authors and assistant professor of 
family medicine and epidemiology at the university of california at 
san francisco 
were just saying this is something else to pay attention to 
that may be even more important he said by telephone thursday 
not only should a person ask a potential partner about past 
behavior but the person should learn enough about the partner to 
know whether to believe the answers the study said 
this would rule out sex with prostitutes casual sex and 
indeed much of what many people would consider to be normal 
heterosexual behavior 
hearst and a colleague dr stephen b hulley analyzed 
estimates of the prevalence of aids infection and the likelihood it 
will be transmitted under different circumstances 
an uninfected person had a onein50 million chance of getting 
the aids virus in a single encounter with a person who doesnt know 
whether he is infected but who uses a condom and is not in a 
highrisk group the study said 
the chance of getting the virus from a person who has a lab test 
showing no evidence of aids infection but who continues to engage 
in highrisk behavior is one in 500000 for a single sexual 
encounter in which a condom is used 
the impact of the test on risk is relatively low because it 
sometimes shows people to be free of the virus when they are not 
hearst said also people may fail to test positive for several 
months after they are infected 
hearst said he believes the study is the first to quantify the 
relative risks of various prevention strategies for aids which has 
struck more than 59000 people in the united states and killed more 
than 33000 
more than 2300 cases or about 4 percent are believed to have 
resulted from heterosexual contact 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the 
bodys defenses against disease leaving a person prey to 
lifethreatening infections and certain cancers

considering the hurlyburly that accompanied 
macbeth on its tumultuous prebroadway tour its surprising 
that the play which arrived thursday at the mark hellinger theater 
makes any sense at all 
but the revival starring christopher plummer and glenda jackson 
as shakespeares famous pair of murdering scots is a fast and 
straightforward production unfortunately this version of 
shakespeares shortest play sacrifices passion and inspiration for 
speed maybe all the blood was spilled in rehearsal 
it was during those rehearsals that the show went through three 
directors several set and costume designers and a half dozen or so 
actors the theater program lists original direction by kenneth 
frankel interim director robin phillips receives no credit at all 
and actress zoe caldwell gets billed for additional direction 
who did what is impossible to determine but whats left on stage 
is a credible if colorless interpretation of shakespeares tragedy 
its generic quality is telegraphed the minute the audience walks 
into the theater what they see are large concretelike slabs that 
look like a postmodernist version of stonehenge at center stage 
is a large bloodspattered throne just in case you forget the 
plot the allpurpose setting designed by daphne dare could be 
used for any of shakespeares tragedies 
what gives the play its moments of fascination are the 
performances of plummer and miss jackson not much electricity 
crackles between them but individually they are able to set off a 
few sparks they do it through two strikingly different approaches 
to their roles 
plummers quiet almost thoughtful macbeth is revealed slowly 
at first he is almost a bumbler a goodnatured if greedy man 
spurred onward by an aggressive wife but after macbeth commits 
that first murder the actor reveals a cynical side that feeds on 
the power it serves him well as the man who killed to be king 
eventually goes to his doom 
miss jacksons pantherlike performance is showier she prowls 
the stage like a cat in heat lusting for power if not her husband 
the one problem with the portrait is that miss jackson seems 
isolated from the rest of the cast theres not much connection 
between the queen and her consort let alone the rest of scotland 
still its fun to watch the actress display her awesome technique 
even if its done in a vacuum 
the large supporting cast is uneven alan scarfe as macduff 
makes an unequal opponent for macbeth but randle mell is a 
strongvoiced even noble malcolm for some reason one of the 
plays three witches is a man an equal opportunity idea that is 
never developed at least these hags dont provoke laughter 
the lighting by marc b weiss is as simple as the sets but much 
more imaginative as it dapples those dreary columns patricia 
zipprodts costumes are also stylish and colorful particularly an 
earthorange gown for miss jackson 
macbeth is not a disaster on the scale of the new york 
shakespeare festivals recent allstar trashing of julius 
caesar still it doesnt offer any startling insights or 
interpretations into a most difficult play to put on stage 
audiences wont be embarrassed or bored by this production but 
then they wont be surprised or exhilarated either 
in other reviews 
frank rich of the new york times writes while the assets of 
the production do produce scattered fine moments and keep chaos 
at bay the lack of a unifying guiding hand is apparent before 
intermission and proves fatal thereafter once blood begins to 
beget blood the performance goes nowhere 
in the daily news howard kissel credits the production for an 
occasional vision of the world turned inferno more often than 
not however its no more wrenching than limbo 
the overall lesson is that a classic play should be done 
only when a director has a clear vital idea of how to do it not 
because stars are available

advocates for continued use of animals in 
medical research hoping to counter protests by animal rights 
activists say animals will play a major role in the search for a 
cure for aids and heart disease 
heart surgeon michael debakey and actors helen hayes and tony 
randall on thursday spoke out at a news conference in favor of 
continued research using animals 
debakey who was first to perform a successful coronary bypass 
and the first to successfully use a partial artificial heart 
recalled that when he was in medical school more than 30 years ago 
not a single cardiovascular disease could be treated 
effectively 
now we have patients who are living reasonably normal lives 
for 20 or 25 years after surgery debakey said the only means 
by which we can do these things is in working in labs with 
animals 
debakey and the others said they chose this week to state their 
case to counter laboratory animal liberation week protests by 
animal rights activists who oppose all use of animals in medical 
research 
if a cure is to be found for aids and heart disease i see no 
alternative hayes said

publisher rupert murdoch says hes selling his 
boston television station because of his great uncertainty over 
renewal of his exemption from the federal ban on ownership of a 
newspaper and tv station in the same city 
murdoch put wftxtv up for sale thursday rather than ask the 
federal communications commission to extend a waiver expiring june 
30 that allows his news america publishing inc to own both wfxt 
and the boston herald 
a murdoch spokesman said several parties had expressed interest 
in the station but he declined to name them he said no asking 
price had been set 
the australian publishers decision came one month after the 
us circuit court of appeals in washington struck down a 
congressional amendment barring the fcc from extending temporary 
waivers to its crossownership rule 
fcc spokesman john kamp said murdoch did not apply for the 
waiver extension for wfxt a uhf station he reportedly bought for 
28 million 
murdoch assailed the fcc rule and sens edward m kennedy 
dmass and ernest hollings dsc who sponsored the 
noextensions amendment 
i hope that the american newspaper industry together with 
broadcasters will continue to encourage federal decisionmakers to 
modify the arcane newspaperbroadcast crossownership rule which 
in fact works against the principle of diversity in such great 
centers of population as new york and boston he said 
the march 29 court ruling said the kennedyhollings amendment 
unconstitutionally singled out murdoch but the appeals judges left 
intact the crossownership ban 
while good progress has been achieved wfxt has suffered as a 
result of the regulatory cloud that the kennedyhollings amendment 
placed over our boston operations murdoch said there remains 
great uncertainty as to the fccs position regarding waiver 
extensions in these circumstances 
murdoch attorney howard m squadron said in february that the 
fcc was unlikely to permanently exempt murdoch from the 
crossownership rule in boston 
fcc general counsel diane killory said at the time that the fcc 
normally grants temporary waivers to give the owner of a 
newspapertv combination time to sell one of the properties for a 
fair price and avoid a distress sale 
for a permanent waiver fcc rules require that the owner prove 
that one of the properties is in financial distress both the 
herald and wfxt are known to be profitable 
murdoch received temporary waivers from the crossownership rule 
after buying wfxt and the new york station wnywtv in 1986 he was 
given until march 6 to sell either wnyw or the new york post and 
until june 30 to sell wfxt or the herald he sold the post to new 
york real estate developer peter kalikow for 37 million on march 7

morris red rudensky a safecracker who 
worked for mobsters al capone and bugs moran but later went 
straight and became a lock and alarm expert for 3m co has died at 
age 89 
rudensky who ended his life as a wellknown humanitarian in st 
paul died thursday in the sholom home in st paul where he had 
lived for the past five years 
born on manhattans lower east side rudensky spent 35 years in 
state and federal prisons and made a series of sensational 
escapes in one he packed himself into a canvas bag with an 
unembalmed corpse 
after his parole in 1944 he became a lock consultant and 
spokesman for 3m cos home security business because of his 
background and his expertise said sam bates a spokesman for 
maplewoodbased 3m 
he toured the country appeared on talk shows including 
the dinah shore show and the merv griffin show and developed sort 
of a celebrity status because of that 
in 1970 rudensky published an autobiography the gonif 
which is yiddish for thief 
in his later years the repentant rudensky was active in the st 
paul clown club which often performs for children in hospitals 
and organized the red rudensky variety show a vaudeville

kansas city st louis and and detroit 
he changed his name to rudensky after he was arrested in kansas 
city and mistakenly identified as another wanted safecracker named 
morris rudensky 
because the crimes of rudensky were less than the crimes of 
maxie the red friedman he went to jail for rudenskys crimes

the cost of an average hospital stay for 
heartattack patients dropped by nearly half between 1972 and 1982 
because of more effective quicker treatment a new study concludes 
put simply doctors had better diagnostic and therapeutic 
tools available by 1982 and they began using them particularly 
coronary bypass surgery said john showstack one of four authors 
of the study published in todays journal of the american medical 
association 
in 1972 a heartattack patient with complications would be 
hospitalized for an average of 23 days and pay a bill of 20900 
showstack said by 1982 that same type of patient was hospitalized 
for an average of just 13 days and billed 10200 both bills were 
calculated in terms of the value of the dollar in 1982 
however doctors costs which comprised 4 percent of the total 
bill in 1972 reached 12 percent of the total by 1982 said 
showstack 
and in five 1982 cases where doctors performed coronary bypass 
surgery the average total bill was 45728 with doctors costs 
making up about 29 percent of the total he said 
everybody directed their efforts at lowering hospital costs 
but they missed the rising costs on the other side of the bill 
said showstack a publichealth researcher at the university of 
californiasan francisco 
and based on some other studies weve done its safe to say 
that both trends are continuing though not at the accelerated 
rate we saw over the 10year period 
researchers looked at the medical records of 164 patients 
admitted to a san francisco hospital following heart attacks in 
1972 1977 and 1982 
in coronary bypass surgery a vein is removed from a patients 
leg and used to bypass an obstructed artery leading to the heart 
other costly surgical procedures now commonly used to treat heart 
attack patients include angioplasty surgically inserting a balloon 
into an artery and inflating it to widen constricted blood vessels 
the san francisco study did not address the effectiveness of the 
various treatments in prolonging patients lives 
showstack said some patients would die clearly without a 
bypass on the other hand theres really no evidence that 
postheartattack patients live longer with a bypass

a senior aide to yasser arafat said today 
that syria would welcome the plo chairman for reconciliation talks 
with president hafez assad to end the two arab leaders 5yearold 
rift 
farouk kaddoumi head of the palestine liberation organizations 
political department made the statement after a fourhour meeting 
with syrian vice president abdulhalim khaddam 
assad sponsored a mutiny against arafat by radical palestinian 
factions in 1983 and expelled the plo leader from damascus the two 
have been at odds since 
the meeting between khaddam and kaddoumi was the first in five 
years between a ranking syrian official and senior arafat aides 
kaddoumi was accompanied by four members of the central 
committee of arafats fatah movement the main faction in the plo 
despite the optimistic note sounded by kaddoumi informed 
palestinian sources said there were still profound differences 
between assad and arafat that will take time to resolve 
they cautioned that there were no immediate prospects of arafat 
visiting damascus to meet the syrian president 
assad moscows main arab ally has been under pressure from the 
soviets to reconcile with arafat for the sake of arab unity to 
present a common front at any middle east peace conference that may 
be convened 
kaddoumis meeting with khaddam marked a significant step in 
that direction 
speaking to reporters following the late night meeting kaddoumi 
said he and khaddam one of assads closest aides agreed to 
continue discussions to reach political agreements to support the 
palestinian struggle against israel 
he noted that a spirit of optimism and hope prevailed at the 
meeting for the resumption of relations between syria and the plo 
and to take broader and new steps in the history of the arab 
struggle 
i expect arafat to come here as soon as possible the door is 
open for all the palestinian brothers to come to syria there are 
no obstacles kaddoumi said 
george habash leader of the marxist popular front for the 
liberation of palestine told the associated press at his damascus 
headquarters that arafat scrapped plans to fly to syria to attend 
the funeral of one of his top officials because the syrians had 
given no guarantees he would be given an official welcome 
there had been hopes the funeral in damascus on wednesday of 
khalil wazir the plos widely respected military commander would 
provide the opportunity for arafat to visit damascus 
if i were in his shoes i would not have missed this 
opportunity habash said 
wazir better known by his nom de guerre of abu jihad or father 
of the holy war was assassinated by a commando squad in tunis last 
saturday israeli sources have said privately that the commandos 
were israeli

tandy corp says it plans to sell the first 
erasablerecordable compact disk an announcement that angered the 
recording industry which fears consumers will use the product to 
copy music at home 
the fort worth texasbased electronics manufacturer which 
markets its products through its radio shack stores also announced 
thursday it will introduce a fast new personal computer that 
follows the design of international business machines corps 
yearold personal system2 
tandy said the compact disk known as the thor cd would be 
available for music in 1 to two years and for data about a year 
after that once recording and playback devices are built the thor 
cd could also be played although not recorded on in standard 
compact disk players tandy said 
were always concerned about technologies that threaten to 
enable consumers to infringe on copyrights said trish heimers 
spokeswoman for the recording industry association of america 
the association has fought digital audio tape or dat 
technology that would allow people to make highquality recordings 
at home 
tandy said it would not only manufacture thor cd equipment but 
would also license other companies to make it 
some day the invention might yield the company hundreds of 
millions of dollars a year in profits from sales and royalties 
john roach tandys chairman and chief executive said at a new 
york news conference 
the verbatim division of eastman kodak has said it will 
introduce readwrite compact disk technology and several japanese 
companies are known to be working on similar products the new york 
times reported today 
the times said some industry analysts were skeptical about 
tandys invention in part because tandy didnt show working 
hardware at the introduction 
this is by no means a perfected technology said tim 
bajarin an analyst with creative strategies in santa clara calif 
tandy said it will be selling its tandy 5000 mc in volume by 
july a few months before dell computer corp of austin texas the 
only other company that has announced a ps2 clone 
tandy officials said their new computer was covered by a patent 
crosslicensing agreement with ibm although certain ps2 patents 
that may be issued to ibm in the future are still subject to 
negotiations

gunmen eluded a huge manhunt early 
today after fleeing the bank in this northwestern coastal city 
where their botched robbery turned into a 24hour hostage drama in 
which five people were killed 
unconfirmed local press reports said the robbers took about 
13000 in bank money carlos cano a policeman participating in 
the hunt confirmed some money was taken but declined to say how 
much 
about 500 police and army personnel backed by a helicopter 
searched for the seven young men thursday night and police set up 
blockades on highways leading out of the city 
the gunmen must have gone to the sierra where it will be 
difficult to locate them said cano the sierra madre mountain 
range is nearby 
the gunmen had holed up inside the local national bank of mexico 
offices after an alarm foiled their robbery 
they let their 42 hostages go thursday when they were permitted 
to flee in an armored car with three red cross workers 
apparently as part of an agreement ending the standoff most of 
the hundreds of police who had surrounded the bank withdrew and 
people massed in the street outside the building 
this is incredible these people are supporting the robbers 
a woman standing nearby told a reporter 
police said the robbers released the three red cross workers 15 
minutes after leaving the bank abandoning the armored car at a gas 
station and took off in a stolen pickup truck and station wagon 
one of the red cross workers rosario angulo said there were 
only five gunmen in the armored car which he was forced to drive 
i think the other two mixed in among the crowd at the moment 
of leaving the bank he said 
angulo said the robbers strapped sticks of dynamite to their 
bodies and toted sawedoff machine guns 
gov francisco labastida ochoa of sinaloa state told the 
televisa tv network the release agreement allowed police to pursue 
the gunmen 
were not deceiving anyone the governor said we simply 
reached an agreement in which we could safeguard lives 
ignacio lara a spokesman for the governor said the gunmen 
demanded earlier that they be allowed to leave by air police said 
the robbers were in their late teens or early 20s and had no 
political motives 
the standoff in los mochis a town of 120000 on the gulf of 
california about 500 miles south of tucson ariz began at 1245 
pm wednesday when the gunmen took hostages after an alarm alerted 
police there was a robbery in progress 
red cross spokesmen said five people were killed and at least 15 
wounded during the attempted robbery and ensuing siege 
spokesman jesus acosta of the local red cross said one of its 
rescue workers was among those killed in a gunfight wednesday 
between police and the robbers 
he said the others slain were a customer bank official and 
teller and a policeman who was in the bank on business 
the wife of one hostage said her husband farmworker juan jose 
terraza 29 was seriously wounded during the gunfight and was 
hospitalized in grave condition he only wanted to cash a 
check she said 
bank robberies and other crime have increased significantly in 
mexico since 1982 when an economic crisis began to eat away 
purchasing power and drive up unemployment 
sinaloa is known as a center for crime especially of the type 
linked to the illegal drug trade

the nationalist government today released 
about 6000 prisoners including 19 political detainees in a mass 
amnesty marking the 100th day since president chiang chingkuos 
death 
huang shihmin a justice ministry official said about 16000 
other prisoners including 11 charged with sedition had their 
sentences reduced they remained behind bars pending completion of 
the shortened jail terms 
justice officials said the release of 6054 gangsters drug 
addicts corrupt officials and other convicted criminals began at 
dawn after brief ceremonies held at jails throughout the island 
each prisoner was presented a red package containing the 
equivalent of about 17 to wish them luck they said 
television showed the prisoners some smiling and some tearful 
being met by anxious wives children and other relatives waiting in 
drizzly weather outside jail 
transportation officials reported all domestic flights and 
trains were packed as prisoners and their relatives headed for home 
five political prisoners were welcomed by about 50 relatives and 
members of the opposition democratic progressive party upon 
arriving at taipeis domestic airport from a jail on green island 
180 miles southeast of taipei 
prominent dissident tai huakuang 37 was among the political 
prisoners released from green island he was sentenced to life 
imprisonment in 1978 on charges of plotting to topple the 
nationalist government by forming an underground communist 
organization 
another dissident pai yachan had tears in his eyes as he told 
reporters he was grateful for those people who fought hard for 
human rights and ending political oppression he said he wanted 
to join opposition politics 
pai 47 was sentenced in 1975 to life imprisonment for 
distributing leaflets calling on chiang then chairman of the 
ruling nationalist party to reveal his wealth and to recall his 
daughter from the united states to show his confidence in taiwan 
under the commutation death sentences were reduced to life 
imprisonment life sentences to 15 years and lesser sentences were 
cut by onethird or onehalf many prisoners released today already 
were serving sentences reduced when martial law was lifted last 
july 
huang said the commutations affected all but a few hundred 
prisoners sentenced for firstdegree murders ammunition smuggling 
and other crimes that could endanger national security and social 
stability 
two political prisoners did not have their sentences reduced 
because they were accused of being communists officials said two 
men jailed earlier this year for advocating an independent taiwan 
were not affected by the commutation because the verdicts are under 
appeal 
president lee tenghui proposed the commutations in february 
after succeeding chiang who died of heart failure jan 13 lee 
the first native taiwanese to head the nationalist government 
approved final details of the plan on tuesday 
among the released political prisoners were six taiwanese 
businessmen sentenced in 1984 and 1986 to 10to12 years in jail 
for visiting mainland china on business justice officials said 
last october chiang eased a ban on travel to the mainland to 
allow family reunions many taiwanese have since visited china to 
explore business possibilities 
nationalist leader chiang kaishek the late presidents father 
led his government in retreat to taiwan in 1949 after losing a 
civil war to the communists on the chinese mainland the 
nationalists still claim to be the rightful rulers of all china and 
do not allow official contacts with the mainland 
after chiang kaishek died in 1975 the government released 
3500 prisoners reduced the sentences of 13000 others in a similar 
mass commutation

we regret that there were deaths but it happened at a time 
when they must stop considering us like birds on the road to 
extinction said joredie who is also official of the main 
melanesian separatist organization the kanak socialist national 
liberation front 
the indigenous but minority melanesians or kanaks are seeking 
to end 135 years of direct french rule and have vowed to boycott 
sundays regional elections 
more than 31 people including 10 policemen have died in five 
years of riots slayings and clashes involving predominantly french 
settlers and kanaks who comprise 43 percent of the nickelrich 
territorys 145000 people 
the front claims to represent most kanaks in the struggle for 
independence 
front leader jeanmarie tjibaou told the ap by telephone that he 
had no advance knowlege of todays attack 
but he said it was part of colonial history that is what 
happens when you scorn and disdain the kanaks 
witnesses said the attackers seemed to be well prepared the 
police station was sacked and a large amount of equipment was 
stolen 
details were difficult to obtain as communications between 
noumea and the island 90 miles away were abruptly cut 
families of the policemen who lived at the station were not 
attacked and suffered no injuries officials said the three slain 
policemen died from machete or hatchet wounds police said 
tjibaou called the incident frightful but said it was not 
surprising in that demands for independence are absolutely not 
taken into consideration that people are scorned and the 
government refuses to listen to them 
last month tjibaou told a news conference in sydney australia 
that his group planned a confrontation before the elections he 
said at the time that outright war was impossible because of 
the french military presence 
kanaks have consistently lost all elections on the independence 
question and tjibaou called for the boycott sunday to protest 
redrawn electoral boundaries he says discriminate against kanaks 
several family members and tourists evacuated from ouvea today 
arrived at noumea airport 
they evacuated all of the whites said a young belgian woman 
the police station attack followed a bomb explosion earlier 
today near military headquarters in noumea the capital and the 
torching of a town hall there were no apparent casualties and no 
group claimed responsibility

senior officers said it will 
take some time to determine how many missilies were fired at this 
us warship and two others in a daylong persian gulf clash with 
iranian forces 
they noted with satisfaction that reports from washington 
indicating the jack williams account of mondays missile firing was 
not being disputed high officals there were saying only that there 
was no positive evidence that chinesemade silkworms were used 
capt donald dyer commander of destroyer squadron 22 said the 
fact that three ships were under fire maneuvering and firing 
chaff could mean some duplication in the reports of missiles 
being fired 
but there is no doubt that missiles were fired at these 
ships he said 
as to what type of missile was used dyer said it was big it 
was fast and it came from iran 
the ships were the jack williams a 3700ton guided missile 
frigate the 4500ton missile destroyer joseph strauss and the 
7810ton destroyer obrien 
the ships make up one of the three threeship groups involved in 
mondays coordinated retaliatory raids on iranian targets and 
iranian reprisals 
mondays clash was the fiercest between the americans and the 
iranians since the us navy buildup in the gulf last july 
irans deployment of the silkworms a chinesemade variant of 
the 30yearold soviet styx missile was revealed a year ago 
the silkworms had never been fired at any military or commercial 
vessels passing through the strategic waterway 
the missiles are about eight feet long and have a range of about 
50 miles with a full 1000pound warhead they fly at about 600 
mph just below the speed of sound at about 100 feet above the 
surface homing in on the target by a narrowband radar 
although crude by modern standards the silkworm is an effective 
weapon 
it just isnt smart said dyer the silkworm has no brain 
whatever it spots first it will reach out and touch 
it was for that reason that the iranian silkworm missile that 
hit the reflagged kuwaiti tanker sea isle city last oct 17 was 
termed a lucky shot by many navy officers at the time 
the missile fired from the faw peninsula of southern iraq was 
fired in the direction of kuwaits big alahmadi oil terminal and 
hit the tanker only because it saw it first they said 
mondays fighting began after the us navy destroyed two 
offshore iranian oil platforms president reagan ordered the 
platforms attacked as retaliation for a mine that blew a hole in 
the navy frigate samuel b roberts last week and wounded 10 sailors 
the pentagon said an iranian patrol boat was sunk three armed 
speedboats sunk or damaged and the frigates sabalan and sahand 
disabled

the government is considering severely limiting 
or banning the sale of a popular antiacne drug because of its 
estimate that hundreds of severe birth defects have been caused by 
the medication it was reported today 
in a confidential memorandum dated feb 11 and obtained thursday 
by the new york times officials of the food and drug 
administration estimated that 900 to 1300 babies were born with 
severe birth defects from 1982 to 1986 because of the drug accutane 
accutane made by roche laboratories a division of hoffmanla 
roche inc of nutley nj is used against disfiguring acne it 
carries a strong warning label and the company has conducted 
extensive campaigns to publicize its risk of causing birth defects 
a spokeswoman for the manufacturer disputed the government 
figures saying thursday that it has reports of 62 cases of 
accutanerelated birth defects among the 700000 to 1 million 
patients with cystic acne for whom the drug has been prescribed 
we do not want to dispute the fact that this drug is 
associated with birth defects said spokeswoman carolyn glynn 
we want to find ways to further reinforce that message 
ms glynn said the company would meet with the fda on tuesday to 
discuss ways to better educate the public doctors and pharmacists 
despite clear warnings that the drug can cause devastating and 
sometimes fatal deformities if taken by pregnant women experts 
estimate thousands have taken accutane during pregnancy since it 
came on the market in 1982 according to the times 
fda officials also attributed 700 to 1000 spontaneous abortions 
to the use of accutane and they estimated that an additional 5000 
to 7000 women had induced abortions solely because of accutane 
exposure and fear of birth defects the newspaper reported 
the estimates were extrapolated from data collected in a 
michigan medicaid study 
ms glynn said that in the 62 cases of birth defects known to 
the company the babies were born with severe disfigurations 
primarily malformations of the head and ears about half the 
afflicted children died at birth she said 
accutane accounts for between 40 million and 50 million in 
sales annually she said 
the drug shuts down the production of sebum which is the oily 
fatty substance that causes the inflammation pain and eventually 
scarring of cystic acne the drugs generic name is isotretinoin 
officials believe that many women and their doctors do not 
always recognize the link between the drug and deformities in 
babies 
by september 1987 the fda had received reports of only 52 
babies with accutanecaused deformities according to the times 
dr robert stern a dermatologist at the harvard medical school 
agreed the situation is a serious problem but he said accutane 
is the only treatment available for many patients with disfiguring 
acne 
accutane is an extremely important drug he told the times 
he stressed that severe acne left uncontrolled scars patients 
both physically and psychologically

rock star mick jagger testified before 
a courtroom packed with excited fans that he did not hear a reggae 
song called just another night before writing his own song with 
the same name in 1983 
jagger lead singer of the rolling stones is being sued for 
copyright infringement by patrick alley 36 of the bronx who 
claims jagger pirated the chorus of his 1979 song 
appearing slightly nervous at he took the stand thursday jagger 
told us district judge gerard goettel and the jury that he had 
often recorded works by other people in his 25 years as a musician 
and had always given them credit 
but he said he never heard alleys song until he was sued by 
alley in 1986 one year after just another night appeared on 
the album shes the boss 
asked by his attorney peter parcher whether he liked alleys 
song jagger said carefully i dont want to cast aspersion on 
mr alley a lot of people in this courtroom dont like my music 
personally i dont really like that song 
to demonstrate how jagger developed his song tapes dating to 
november 1983 were played the first tape was a version of the song 
jagger described as just me with acoustic guitar starting off 
with this tune 
jagger who swayed with the music each time occasionally 
appeared embarrassed as some of tapes had him just making sounds 
with the music 
jaggers guitar and other equipment had been set up in court 
but another of his lawyers gerald margolis said he would play 
only if he has to 
another of jaggers attorneys helene freeman said that if 
jagger performed it would be to show how he developed the song 
independent development of the same or similar ideas would not 
violate copyright law she said 
earlier daniel ricigliano chairman of the theory department at 
the manhattan school of music said that while the rhythmical 
settings of the two choruses were similar because of the similarity 
of lyrics and ideas the choruses were totally different in 
every musical way 
he said a review of song titles at the performing arts library 
in lincoln center revealed more than one dozen songs since 1928 
with the title just another night and at least one with the 
title just another night with you 
an expert who testified for alley said the choruses of the two 
songs were virtually identical 
alleys chorus contains the words can i spend another just 
another night just another night just another night with you 
jaggers lines are give me just another night just another 
night with you give me just another kiss just before the dawn 
breaks through 
the jury will determine whether there was an actual infringement 
of alleys copyright if there was a second trial will determine 
damages

thousands of people sang danced and threw roses 
and confetti as 29 kuwaitis freed by arab gunmen after a 16day 
hijacking ordeal arrived home from algiers 
while the kuwaitis celebrated thursday western diplomatic 
sources said the nine proiranian hijackers who were given safe 
passage out of algeria had reached beirut 
the two other freed hostages saudi arabian citizens were flown 
home in a private executive jet 
todays editions of the new york times quoted unidentified arab 
officials as saying the hijackers who had killed two kuwaiti 
hostages were flown on a private algerian jet to damascus syria 
and then were believed to have traveled by land to beirut 
the officials also were quoted as saying that with the 
exception of one iranian most of the hijackers were thought to be 
lebanese citizens 
western intelligence sources have said that the nine are 
believed to be members of hezbollah or party of god the 
proiranian shiite moslem extremist group based in lebanons bekaa 
valley 
a plo mediator in the hijacking was quoted by a rome newspaper 
today as saying the gunmen originally planned to land in lebanon 
blow up the plane and keep the passengers hostage in beirut syrian 
troops who control the airport refused to let the plane land 
as they arrived in kuwait thursday night women threw roses and 
confetti at the 22 passengers and seven crew members who had been 
prisoners in the seized kuwait airways boeing 747 
several said they were certain iran was a party to the hijacking 
the emir of kuwait sheik jaber ahmed sabah and crown prince 
sheik saad abdullah sabah led the group of government officials and 
relatives that met the freed captives at the kuwait airport the 
hostages included three cousins of the emir 
kuwaitis at the airport celebrated their leaders resolve in not 
bowing to the hijackers demand that kuwait release 17 proiranian 
terrorists jailed for bombing the us and french embassies in 
kuwait in 1983 
flocks of doves soared over the airport after the kuwait airways 
boeing 707 touched down completing a sixhour flight from algiers 
where the ordeal ended early wednesday 
bedouin men danced and clapped at the kuwaiti airport and 
children waved flags and sang god bless our father jaber 
referring to the emir 
the freed hostages traveled by motorcade to the city center 
along a route lined by thousands of people hundreds followed in 
cars and limousines honking their horns and singing we 
sacrifice blood and souls for you o kuwait 
the hijackers who dumped the bodies of two kuwaiti security men 
from the seized plane while it was on the ground in larnaca 
cyprus apparently agreed to free the remaining hostages in return 
for safe passage 
algeria which mediated has refused to discuss the deal 
algerian sources speaking on condition of anonymity have said the 
hijackers slipped out of the plane shortly before the hostages were 
let out 
some of the freed kuwaitis said one hijacker was replaced by two 
others when the plane landed in mashhad iran april 5 the day it 
was seized on a bangkokkuwait flight with 122 aboard 
one of the two was obviously a military pilot he was ordering 
other gunmen around and telling them lots of things about the 
aircraft and supervising the wiring of explosives to most parts of 
the plane said passenger khaled nasser zaferi 
the claims corroborated accounts of hostages freed earlier in 
the ordeal some of whom said additional weapons and explosives 
were brought aboard in mashhad where the plane spent three days 
the times quoted the arab sources as saying the plane was 
supplied at mashhad with communications gear that allowed it to 
stay in touch with outside parties that were issuing instructions 
at least at larnaca 
malaz abdo deputy director of the palestine liberation 
organization office in cyprus said the hijackers plan to land in 
beirut was foiled when president hafez assad of syria refused to 
let the plane land romes paese sera newspaper reported today 
syria is the main power broker in lebanon 
abdo acted as a mediator in negotiations with the hijackers in 
larnaca the planes second stop 
the hijackers released 57 hostages in mashhad and 13 at larnaca 
in exchange for the fuel that took them to their third stop 
algiers where an elderly diabetic was released last week 
kuwait and other arab countries praised algeria for achieving 
freedom for the hostages without additional violence but the 
united states britain and other western powers criticized algeria 
for allowing the hijackers to get away 
a sovietbuilt antonov transport of the algerian air force was 
seen taking off from the algiers airport before dawn wednesday 
shortly before the hostages left the hijacked plane it was widely 
assumed the hijackers were aboard

orders to us factories for big ticket 
durable goods were virtually unchanged in march as a drop in orders 
for military hardware more than offset gains elsewhere the 
government said today 
the commerce department said orders for durable goods items 
expected to last three or more years totaled a seasonally adjusted 
1143 billion last month 
that was a negligible 53 million rise and followed a slight 01 
percent increase in february and a sharp 12 percent drop in 
january 
economists had been expecting a substantial increase in new 
orders for march however the february number represents a sharp 
upward revision from a previous estimate of a 11 percent drop 
in march a 30 percent drop in the volatile defense goods 
category to 83 billion more than offset a 03 percent increase 
in orders for nondefense goods which rose to 1060 billion 
orders for primary metals such as steel jumped 42 percent in 
march after a 09 percent rise in february at 108 billion they 
stood 194 percent ahead of last year 
there was also strength in transportation primarily motor 
vehicles and aircraft it rose 25 percent to 313 billion after 
a strong 55 percent boost in february 
analysts in advance of the report attributed much of the 
increase in that category to a rise in orders for boeing aircraft 
orders for electrical machinery plummeted 47 percent to 186 
billion while nonelectrical machinery edged down 02 percent to 
197 billion 
the key category of nondefense capital goods which economists 
consider a good indicator of factory expansion plans fell 13 
percent on top of a 30 percent decline in february but at 333 
billion it was still 201 percent ahead of a year ago 
shipments of durable goods rose 26 percent in march to 1133 
billion after a 14 percent rise in february

some christian activists say they 
will vigorously oppose a universal pictures movie based on a book 
in which jesus is portrayed as a wimp who lusts after a prostitute 
the last temptation of christ called a look at the human 
side of jesus was shot in morocco last fall it stars willem dafoe 
as jesus barbara hershey as mary magdalene and harvey keitel as 
judas iscariot 
scheduled for release in september the movie is based on greek 
author nikos kazantzakis 1955 book the last temptation of 
christ which was condemned as heretical by the greek orthodox 
church 
in a section of the book that troubles some conservative 
christians satan tempts jesus with lust for mary magdalene a 
prostitute who became one of his followers in another jesus 
apparently ponders homosexuality 
i dont see how a producer can stay true to the book and not 
come out with a movie that is offensive to the christian community 
the book is shot through with contradictions of the scriptures 
said the rev donald wildmon a united methodist minister who heads 
the american family association in tupelo miss which monitors 
television shows and films 
were trying to head the movie off at the pass so its not 
blasphemous said ted baehr editor of an atlantabased christian 
newsletter that monitors theatrical films 
only martin scorsese who is editing the film in new york knows 
whats in the final version and he doesnt talk to any press at 
all when hes editing on any movie said spokeswoman marion 
billings 
scorsese who directed taxi driver and raging bull once 
studied for the priesthood 
this is a film that ive wanted to make for 15 years both as 
a filmmaker and christian he said in a statement im making a 
deeply religious film which is an affirmation of faith and i ask 
everyone not to judge my film until they see it 
universal pictures has hired a bornagain christian marketing 
consultant tim penland who advised on the films chariots of 
fire and the mission to help ward off controversy 
i think theres an awful lot of interest in this movie in the 
christian community and theres paranoia about what it contains 
penland said thursday 
wildmon said a sacrilegious film would provoke a protest against 
universal and its parent company mca 
we will be prepared to fight it with everything weve got and 
it would be an easy battle to win wildmon said 
the rev john probst a baptist minister whose media focus group 
offers bible study classes at studios and networks has objected to 
the portrayal of jesus as a wimpy almost milquetoast 
character he has asked christians to write tom pollock chairman 
of the mca motion picture group with their concerns 
the attempt of this movie is not to be prurient about jesus 
pollock said this is one of our great filmmakers and to cast 
the film as sacrilegious before anyone has seen it is unfair

a faculty decision to require more black 
professors at duke university makes the school a leader on an issue 
that troubles nearly every college and university in the nation a 
black professor says 
i think this whole affair will reflect positively on duke 
erdman palmore said thursday after a faculty council adopted a 
resolution to require each of the schools 56 departments and 
programs to add at least one black faculty member by fall of 1993 
as far as i know we are the first university establishing 
such a strong policy mandating the hiring of more black faculty 
the measure passed 3519 is subject to endorsement by the 
administration but approval was expected because the resolution 
had the support of university president h keith h brodie 
more than 100 students wearing blackandwhite checkered 
armbands cheered and waved signs at thursdays crowded meeting as 
the council adopted the resolution after weeks of heated campus 
debate 
its a clear victory were ecstatic said christopher 
foster 20 chairman of the black student alliance its going to 
provide a clearly diverse education for students at duke and give 
us mentors in our field of interest 
we did it peacefully and diplomatically added karim deane 
21 a black student from lynchburg va 
duke has 31 black faculty members out of a total of 1399 
fourteen are in the universitys medical school while there are 40 
departments with no black faculty 
last year duke hired 155 faculty five of them black 
brodie said prior to the vote my prediction is without this 
resolution this year we will do about the same 
the resolution was largely symbolic since the university 
administration could have adopted the policy on its own but it 
preferred to get a faculty consensus first said philip stewart 
chairman of the faculty committee 
the debate had centered on whether the resolution should 
require the university to hire more blacks the council on 
march 17 struck the word instead instructing the administration 
to provide incentives 
that vote sparked campuswide protests and generated a petition 
signed by about 2500 people asking the council to reconsider all 
seven members of the committee on black faculty which worked to 
bring more black professors to duke resigned from the panel in 
protest april 8 
thursdays vote restored the original language and also added a 
demand for money for the recruiting of more black faculty 
duke officials said there are 758 minority students among the 
6423 undergraduates and 530 minorities among the 4368 graduate 
and professional students

conference on theology politics and peace sponsored by the 
carter center and emory universitys candler school of theology

making of political decisions 
religious leaders are failing but the failure need not be 
permanent carter said all faiths have in them a seed of 
hope 
carter included in his criticism pope john paul ii whom he said 
has failed to denounce human rights violations strongly enough 
i have read his speeches and i have been extremely 
disappointed with the bland nature of them carter said in a 
brief questionandanswer session after his address 
he said the pope missed opportunities in chile el salvador and 
nicaragua to criticize governments that have mistreated their 
citizens 
carter said the war between iran and iraq in the persian gulf is 
one of the bloodiest in history and is between two islamic groups 
whose differences are almost indiscernible to outsiders 
he also cited violence between protestants and roman catholics 
in northern ireland and between moderate and ultrareligious jews

mikhail s gorbachev suggested to secretary of 
state george p shultz today that were marking time in 
superpower relations as hope for a new arms control accord faded 
but shultz disagreed from our point of view we are far from 
marking time he said we are keeping time in a very strong 
way 
shultz differed with the soviet leaders appraisal at a news 
conference after a threehour session but shultz did not list an 
arms reduction treaty as one of the significant achievements to 
be expected when president reagan meets with gorbachev in a moscow 
summit may 29june 2 
in fact shultz said the going is hard to complete a pact 
to reduce strategic nuclear weapons in the five weeks remaining 
its pick and shovel work he said 
shultzs session with gorbachev in the gilded catherines hall 
followed nine hours of talks with foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze over two days 
when shultz told the soviet leader im here to make 
preparations for the presidents visit 
gorbachev responded as for the substance it seems that we 
are losing something maybe were marking time 
the two men shook hands at the outset but gorbachev seemed 
somewhat subdued american reporters were cautioned by soviet 
officials that if they tried to ask questions of gorbachev during 
the phototaking session they would not be invited back 
usually gorbachev welcomes a few questions 
there have been reports of a kremlin power struggle between 
gorbachev and yegor k ligachev the man reputed to rank second in 
the ruling politburo 
ligachev is regarded as more conservative than gorbachev 
especially on the soviet leaders policy of glasnost or 
greater openness on selected topics reports this week have said 
ligachev may have been stripped of some of his power 
shultz made no mention of the reports at his news conference 
but he spoke positively of the way ussoviet relations have 
evolved since gorbachevs rise to power three years ago 
he said reagans summit meeting with gorbachev would have a 
very businesslike tone and the two leaders would have a great 
deal of substance to talk about 
through interpreters gorbachev joked a bit with shultz over the 
many thousands of miles the american envoy had logged recently in 
trips to the middle east the soviet union and europe 
american officials have virtually abandoned hopes of completing 
a treaty to reduce longrange nuclear missiles by the time the 
summit starts 
on the regional front there was little superpower cooperation 
despite another appeal by shultz the soviets still declined to 
support an international arms embargo against iran which delays 
any action by the un security council 
a us official told reporters thursday that a newly submitted 
soviet draft on space defense conforms to a tough soviet line that 
could make weapons cutbacks impossible 
president reagan hoped to sign a treaty at the summit to reduce 
arsenals of longrange bombers missiles and submarines by 30 
percent to 50 percent 
but the soviets suspicious of reagans star wars program 
want a guarantee they could halt the cutbacks if the united states 
conducts tests in space judged to be in violation of the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty 
the reagan administration has strenuously resisted limits on the 
program that seeks a spacebased defense against ballistic missiles 
one small note of progress was an agreement on procedures for 
joint underground nuclear tests in july the first test will be 
held in the nevada desert the other at semipalatinsk in the 
soviet republic of kazakhstan 
the idea is to compare us and soviet techniques for measuring 
the extent of the explosions 
in reports to congress reagan has accused the soviets of 
exceeding the 150 kiloton ceiling set in 1974 and 1976 treaties 
the soviets denied the charges 
if the two sides can agree on measurements and make them more 
precise reagan may submit the treaties to the senate for 
ratification before he leaves office next january 
one kiloton is equivalent to the explosion of 1000 tons of tnt 
shultz and shevardnadze who have held three rounds of talks 
will meet again in midmay two weeks before reagan visits moscow 
in washington last december gorbachev and reagan signed an 
accord ridding both of their nations of medium and shorterrange 
missiles they called then for another pact cutting strategic arms 
by 50 percent but negotiations in geneva have been proceeding 
slowly

a woman who told police in 1968 that she saw 
a girl in a polkadot dress running from the scene of robert f 
kennedys slaying told a radio station that investigators badgered 
her into changing her story 
sandra serranosewell 40 said thursday she never recanted her 
tale of a young woman running from the ambassador hotel after the 
kennedys assassination the woman she said told her and others 
standing outside we shot him we shot him 
during the interview with jack thomas of kuop radio in stockton 
ms serranosewell admitted she altered her initial description of 
the dress but blamed police harassment for the change 
there was a lot of badgering that was going on she said 
i was just 20 years old and i became unglued 
police files of the kennedy investigation released in sacramento 
on tuesday reported that ms serranosewell fully recanted the 
story about two weeks after kennedys june 5 assassination which 
came moments after he had declared victory in the california 
presidential primary 
the whole thing was a lie the files quoted ms 
serranosewell as saying on june 20 1968 
however she now says that lengthy grilling in a police 
interrogation room where white polkadot dresses were tacked all 
over the walls caused her to give in 
i said what they wanted me to say ms serranosewell said 
i dont want to have to go through that again that kind of 
everyday harassment being put in a room for hours with polkadot 
dresses all around you it was just a bad scene 
she said she felt singled out for police scrutiny although she 
said four other witnesses standing outside the hotel that night 
reported similar accounts of a fleeing young woman 
the recently released police files said ms serranosewell 
recanted her story after failing a lie detector test police 
canceled an allpoints bulletin seeking a woman in a white 
polkadot dress the next day

members of community organizations that promote 
minority hiring banded together to extort payoffs from contractors 
by threatening to stop or disrupt work authorities charged 
they wanted their wallets stuffed said us attorney andrew 
j maloney this was not a civil rights movement as far we can 
tell 
he announced thursday that 13 people most of them leaders and 
associates of the minority organizations were charged with 
extorting more than 112000 since 1981 nine were charged with 
conspiracy to commit extortion and four with extortion 
the charges resulted in part from a sevenyearold undercover 
investigation which included the formation of a contracting company 
run by agents said kenneth frawley commissioner of the city 
department of investigation 
a portion of the payoffs was provided by the undercover agents 
with city funds frawley said that money was not recovered 
frawley said that during the investigation some of the 
defendants told undercover officers this is not about jobs here 
this is about money

any organization but rather that the individual members abused 
their positions 
the defendants were allegedly affiliated with five groups 
identified as free at last link community construction workers 
inc fair south brooklyn construction workers and brooklyn fight 
back 
ten of the 13 defendants were arrested wednesday and thursday

the ptl ministry is suing jessica hahn to 
regain money in a trust account that was promised to her in 
exchange for her silence about a 1980 sexual encounter with former 
ptl leader jim bakker 
the financially troubled television ministry says in a lawsuit 
filed this week in us bankruptcy court in columbia that hahn 
broke her part of the bargain by talking publicly about the 
encounter that led to bakkers downfall 
the suit also seeks reimbursement of any excess legal fees paid 
to california lawyer scott furstman who managed the trust fund for 
ptl furstman has agreed to that the suit said 
hahn contacted by telephone at the playboy mansion in los 
angeles said thursday she doesnt want the money but she said she 
wants to make sure its used properly 
she said ptl lawyers have told her about 160000 remains in the 
account she said she refused the attorneys request that she sign 
a contract returning the money to ptl 
i would like to do what is right hahn said but at this 
point i dont know if what theyre doing is right i didnt 
know if it was in my best interest to sign something like this 
i fell for this once and im not going to fall for it twice 
signing something i dont know what i was signing 
in november 1984 hahn signed a document recanting accusations 
against bakker but she said she was forced into signing it and 
that a former ptl board member gave her 10000 after she did 
the trust account was formed in february 1985 after hahn 
reasserted her complaints 
ptl agreed to pay her 115000 in cash and to establish a trust 
fund of 150000 she was to receive monthly interest payments from 
the fund for 20 years after which she would receive the principal 
in return hahn agreed not to speak publicly about her tryst 
with bakker 
the lawsuit claims playboy magazine paid hahn 1 million for her 
story and photographs it concludes that by virtue of the terms 
of the settlement agreement and hahns decision to publicize for 
financial gain her version of the dec 6 1980 incident the 
funds in the jessica hahn trust should be restored to ptl in 
their entirety 
hahn disputed ptls contention that she had broken her promise 
she said evangelist jerry falwell who assumed control of ptl after 
bakker resigned in march 1987 cut off payments to her in april 
1987

500pound bengal tiger on the louisiana state university campus 
snapped from pressure but deserves compassion says basketball

courses to improve his english 
cezar was never in danger from the tiger a 13yearold named 
mike iv 
what happened to gato could have happened to any of us his 
personal problems were overwhelming and he snapped brown told a 
news conference after cezar was freed from jail and taken to a 
hospital for psychiatric testing 
the baton rouge district attorneys office said no final 
decision had been made on charges but that consideration would be 
given to the fact that the university itself does not plan to press 
charges

an uncertain future said brown adding that cezar plans to 
return home voluntarily 
cezar was befriended by the globetrotting brown last summer in

to those of you who shouted tiger bait what can i say 
brown said may you never experience sadness and loneliness and 
may you find a love that you couldnt give last night

yegor k ligachev the communist party politburo 
member who has been reported to be in politcal trouble took part 
in a kremlin gala today 
there have been reports and rumors ligachev was reprimanded and 
demoted for opposing mikhail s gorbachevs reform policies 
at an evening gathering of the kremlin leadership to mark the 
118th anniversary of the birth of soviet founder vladimir i lenin 
ligachev filed into the crowded auditorium of the palace of 
congresses in his rightful place 
ligachev considered the countrys no 2 leader followed 
general secretary gorbachev president andrei a gromyko and 
premier nikolai i ryzhkov 
gorbachev and ligachev sat together at the front of the huge 
hall and engaged in animated conversation throughout a speech by 
candidate member of the politburo georgy p razumovsky the speech 
was shown on national television 
rumors have been spread around the capital this week that 
ligachev was reprimanded by gorbachev at an extraordinary meeting 
of the 13man politburo and stripped of responsibility for ideology 
and personnel matters the tasks usually assigned to the 
secondincommand 
the new york times in todays editions quoted unnamed soviet 
officials as saying ligachev was all but removed as the communist 
partys no 2 leader 
but the party ideologist traditionally follows the premier in 
the official lineup and ligachev appeared after ryzhkov during the 
gala 
ligachev 67 thought to be more conservative than gorbachev 
reportedly believes glasnost or gorbachevs policy of openness 
has gone too far in denouncing most of the economic and social 
policies of the past 
because of the the rumors and reports the gala was watched to 
see if ligachev who some said was on a long vacation would show 
up 
the formal arena for changing duties among party secretaries 
would be at a central committee plenum but if ligachev were in 
serious political trouble he would likely take a lower profile 
until the next plenary meeting 
foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfiliev told reporters toay 
that there has been no change in the distribution of duties 
when asked about official though anonymous claims that alexander 
n yakovlev stepped up to take over ligachevs role 
perfiliev said there had been no shakeup in the leadership but 
seemed to add as protection that ligachev was on a short 
vacation in the event he did not show up at the kremlin 
gathering 
the alleged internal dispute apparently came to a head over the 
past month when an article in defense of late dictator josef v 
stalin was published by the daily sovietskaya rossiya then 
denounced by the party organ pravda 
ligachev was rumored to have been behind the prostalin letter 
and the pravda denunciation indicated the party had defined that 
theme as beyond the limits of glasnost 
despite the muchtouted campaign to bring the problems of life 
to the forefront soviet media never name names when referring to 
highlevel resistance to gorbachevs reforms the official silence 
leaves observers to the counsel of sources who often seek to 
present the internal conflicts in a light favorable to the official 
of their liking 
editors and other officials who have periodic contact with top 
party officials have been giving conflicting hints to westerners 
about the fate of ligachev a stocky whitehaired figure with a 
booming voice

the official xinhua news agency said today the 
us presidential campaign is shaping up as a battle between vice 
president george bush and gov michael dukakis of massachusetts 
an analysis written by bao guanfren said the republican bush has 
the advantage of an early grip on his nomination by an 
essentially united party while dukakis nomination as the 
democratic candidate is likely but not yet assured 
bush can benefit from a rather sound economy the reagan 
heritage of lowering inflation and unemployment negotiating new 
arms agreements with the soviet union and his experience in 
government and foreign affairs it said 
however staying for more than seven years under the tutelage 
of president reagan he has had little in the way of his own 
record his loyalty to reagan has earned him the bad reputation of 
wimp and the irancontra scandal is still shadowing him 
dukakis has even more troubles his nomination is very likely 
but still not as assured as bushs whether jesse jackson gives 
him the freedom to pick the kind of running mate he really wants is 
still a problem 
dukakis was unknown nationally six months ago after nine years 
as governor of massachusetts his only legacy is as the architect 
of the massachusetts miracle and he uses his state as an example 
of the economic development housing and education reforms he 
promises for the nation 
his frontrunner status has been achieved not through 
overwhelming support but through a general feeling among democrats 
that ho hum theres no one better

human bones discovered in the ceiling of 
a downtown 19th century building came from more than one body and 
may be as old as the building authorities said 
i wouldnt say that unless i was quite sure said monroe 
county medical examiner dr nicholas forbes who conducted a 
preliminary examination of the bones found by a construction crew 
forbes said thursday that he found duplicate bones which could 
not have come from the same body although thats about all he was 
able to tell 
the bones a shoulder blade and parts of legs and arms will be 
sent to syracuse to be examined by forensic anthropologist william 
rodriguez in the onondaga county medical examiners office 
when you start talking about the comingling of individuals it 
gets a little complicated forbes said so we need someone who 
has some expertise in this area 
that examination is expected to take a few weeks forbes said

democratic presidential contender michael 
dukakis said today i think it would be a tragedy if president 
reagan vetoes the major trade bill heading for passage in congress 
earlier at a rally at a ford plant the massachusetts governor 
said the bill is the right thing to do and its the fair thing to 
do 
it would be tragic he told reporters at the airport if the 
bill were vetoed because of a mild plantclosing provision 
the bill which won easy house passage thursday and seems 
destined for similar senate action next week would overhaul the 
nations foreign trade laws 
reagan said thursday he will veto it if it arrives on his desk 
with a provision to require all but the smallest employers to give 
60day notice of plant closings and largescale layoffs 
dukakis said a notification law in massachusetts had helped his 
state save 20000 jobs by enabling government officials to be aware 
of business problems and to work to resolve them 
thursday night dukakis acting ever more like the democratic 
presidential nominee said he wouldnt have a white house spokesman 
who makes up presidential quotes as he goes along that was a 
reference to former reagan spokesman larry speakes who admitted 
making up quotes for the president 
the frontrunning democrat looking to follow his new york 
victory with another win tuesday in pennsylvania and the week after 
in ohio and indiana hit on the themes of rebuilding americas 
industrial base as he toured the countrys industrial heartland 
over the past decade in communities all over ohio and 
pennsylvania and indiana weve seen the same kind of pain and 
agony and uncertainty that we lived through in new england during 
the 50s and 60s and early 70s dukakis told the city club of 
cleveland on thursday night ive seen what happens when good 
decent hardworking people lose their jobs 
dukakis emphasized his themes of reinvesting in america support 
for plantclosing legislation and increased excellence in education 
as he planned to visit a ford plant near toledo today and a steel 
mill in pittsburgh 
were going to encourage management and labor to work 
together not as enemies but as allies to outhustle outproduce 
outsell and outcompete every nation on earth he said 
the massachusetts politician has opened up a lead over jesse 
jackson the only remaining active rival for the nomination in the 
associated press delegate count in the past two weeks his big 
victory in new york sparked talk that the nomination is all but his 
in his cleveland speech during a campaign day marred by plane 
breakdowns dukakis took speakes to task for making up quotes for 
president reagan on at least two occasions 
speakes revealed the actions in his justpublished book 
speaking out the furor over the disclosure cost speakes his 
public relations job at a wall street firm 
i have a quaint policy as governor no press release will ever 
go out of my office in my name without me reviewing it first 
dukakis said if im ever president of the united states i can 
assure you i will have a press secretary that reports on what i say 
and does not compose things as he goes along 
he added and i cant imagine having a press secretary who was 
feeding quotes to the press that i hadnt uttered and approved 
as he has in the past week dukakis directed his fire at the 
reagan administration not at jackson 
we have a labor department and an nlrb national labor 
relations board that wont stand up for america because we have 
got an attorney general who couldnt tell the difference between 
antitrust and antifreeze dukakis said in cleveland

rescue ships and planes searched 
the waters of the north atlantic today for survivors of a tanker 
than broke in half and burst into flames 
hopes that some of the crew escaped the flaming tanker were 
buoyed when rescue ships reported a life raft was missing from the 
ship said us coast guard petty officer larry lawrence 
authorities do not know the origin of the tanker what it was 
carrying or how many people were on board 
they are scouring the area around both sections looking for 
survivors said petty officer brad terrill of the coast guard in 
new york apparently both sections although they are in flames 
appear to be floating 
the research ship hudson spotted the burning tanker at about 
midnight 370 miles southeast of cape race newfoundland the 
search and rescue coordination center in halifax nova scotia 
reported 
the hudson joined by an italian ship the italica in looking 
for survivors officials said 
two canadian aurora patrol aircraft were joining the search 
canadian officials said the us coast guard also dispatched a 
plane and terrill said the canadian fisheries patrol vessel cape 
rober was steaming into the area 
an earlier report that an empty lifeboat was seen floating 
nearby was erroneous according to the hudsons commanding officer 
terrill said 
we dont know the size how many people on board or even the 
name of the tanker said lt norman selley also at the 
operations center in new york 
terrill said the hudson has not reported any pollution in the 
waters around the tanker

large numbers of contras have been retreating 
across the nicaraguan border into honduras because of an acute food 
shortage in rebel camps in nicaragua a leader of the insurgent 
forces said today 
no us aid has been sent to the insurgents in nicaragua since 
feb 29 and 479 million in humanitarian aid approved by congress 
cannot be delivered to rebel forces there until contra and 
sandinista negotiators make progress in ceasefire talks 
a breakthrough is not expected before next month because the 
talks have been suspended until april 28 
alfredo cesar a member of the contra political leadership told 
reporters the number of rebels on the honduran side of the border 
has swelled in recent weeks to 3000 to 4000 because of the food 
shortages in nicaragua it was not clear however how many rebels 
were in that area prior to the recent exodus from nicaragua 
rebel forces in jungle and mountainous regions in nicaragua face 
a very difficult situation cesar said he added that the 
troops will be ordered to return to nicaragua once ussponsored 
food shipments inside nicaragua begin 
the food situation in contra camps on the honduran side of the 
border improved this week with the delivery of 69000 tons of rice 
beans and other items acquired with the us aid money an agency 
for international development official told reporters thursday 
the shipments were sent from the honduran capital of tegucigalpa 
after being inspected by independent observers including honduran 
clergymen to ensure that the deliveries contained no lethal 
equipment the official said 
the legislation approving the aid package barred military aid to 
the contras 
the official who insisted on anonymity said that based on 
talks he had last week with contra leaders the food situation for 
the estimated 12000 rebels stationed inside nicaragua is getting 
very desperate 
another official said more than a few hundred contras have 
crossed the border into honduras over the past several weeks to 
escape the food shortages in nicaragua 
many of those still in nicaragua are beginning to sell off what 
few assets they have for food while others are buying on credit 
promising merchants repayment once deliveries begin on the us 
humanitarian aid package approved three weeks ago the official 
said 
the sandinistas and the contras reached a temporary truce last 
march 23 that allows for humanitarian aid for the rebels once they 
are settled in seven mutually agreed ceasefire zones 
but talks on establishing ground rules for the zones are at an 
impasse leaving rebel forces in a precarious position 
the official said there are one or two known instances in which 
rebels have used their weapons to take food and more such 
incidents can be expected if the talks drag on inconclusively 
the sandinistas have a big advantage because in contrast to the 
rebels the government is able to feed its troops without 
restrictions he said 
the playing field isnt quite level in this negotiation the 
official added 
asked whether the sandinistas mindful of contra food shortages 
are using delaying tactics in the negotiations the official said 
not yet but if it drags on youre going to have to raise 
that question 
congress imposed an aid cutoff on feb 29 but approved the 
humanitarian aid package after the breakthrough in the 
sandinistacontra talks a month ago 
the package contains 177 million for food clothing shelter 
and medical supplies and medical services the remainder is 
earmarked for treating children who are victims of the war and for 
verifying compliance with the agreement 
the sandinstas and the contras are trying to reach agreement not 
only on ground rules for ceasefire zones but also terms for a 
permanent peace settlement

prosecutors have decided not to file charges 
against a wcbstv reporter who registered several times for this 
weeks primary election to demonstrate the potential for vote fraud 
reporter barbara nevins said wednesday night she had registered 
to vote in manhattan brooklyn queens staten island and nassau 
county using a series of names and friends addresses she said she 
voted only once 
betty dolen executive director of the board of elections who 
was interviewed by ms nevins said she referred the case to 
prosecutors because it is illegal to give false information to 
election officials or to register falsely 
the manhattan district attorneys office decided thursday not to 
file charges against ms nevins said gerald mckelvey spokesman 
for district attorney robert morgenthau 
us rep bill green criticized the board for seeking 
prosecution of ms nevins 
a reporters duty is to alert the public to the realities of 
life he said killing the messenger does not negate the 
message 
the board should determine whether the potential for fraud 
multiple registration and voting is enough to require changes in 
the system seeking to prosecute the reporter is unjustified 
and darn foolish 
mrs dolen said ms nevins admitted in her news report that she 
had committed class e felonies what she did is against the law 
and i gave it to the district attorney she said 
i was disturbed by the attempt to prosecute me ms nevins 
said i thought the response was inappropriate when we showed 
mrs dolen a flaw in the system the response should have been 
theres something wrong lets fix it instead she turned the 
tables and pointed a finger at me 
mrs dolen said fraudulent registration is rare but cautioned 
that breaking the law on television could encourage others to do it 
i told her if you go on television people who have never 
thought about doing something like this will think about doing so 
i think shes really out of line she said 
ms nevins report did not suggest that widespread fraud was 
committed in tuesdays primary but stressed that a campaign to rig 
a local election might work

the captain power cartoon series 
televisions first interactive program has hired a 
psychiatrist in response to concerns the syndicated show is too 
violent for young viewers 
the interactive format of captain power which has been 
criticized by the national coalition on television violence allows 
children to shoot villains by aiming a special toy gun at 
bright orange dots on the screen 
psychiatrist carole lieberman was retained by captain power 
executive producer gary goddard after she independently studied the 
program and complained about its violent content 
when you have a high action show its important to balance 
the action and adventure with an awareness that our audience 
includes young viewers goddard said 
captain power was the toprated weekly childrens syndicated 
series during the november 1987 sweeps period according to ac 
nielsen co and is the fourthrated overall childrens syndicated 
program it is currently seen in more than 200 us markets and 46 
foreign countries 
the image of a kid coming home to an empty house sitting in a 
dark room and shooting at a television set is a very disturbing 
one said lieberman who has served as a psychiatric script 
consultant on more than 100 tv and movie productions 
there are studies 43 out of 47 to be exact that show when a 
child is exposed to violent toys or media the child becomes more 
aggressive in the period of time following she said 
lieberman said the studies also found the more aggressive a 
child is when he is young the more likely he will stay that way as 
a teenager and as an adult there are great implications from 
this exposure to violence 
upon reviewing scripts and tapes of the show lieberman to her 
admitted surprise discovered many positive things about the 
series she noted the program demonstrated teamwork and values 
particularly in each episodes secondary storyline 
the psychiatrist suggested that the orange dot targets be moved 
as often as possible away from the bodies of the villains to 
inanimate objects such as computer pads this allows children to 
do something productive in aiding captain powers fight for 
good rather than promoting violence against others she said 
lieberman also said the series will be decreasing the amount and 
length of violence by trimming the running time of the battle 
scenes 
my role in captain power is not that of a censor insisted 
lieberman i want to work with the writers and creative team to 
enhance the characters human elements and positive stories dont 
have to take a second place to action nor do you have to sacrifice 
any excitement

michael dukakis and jesse jackson now in a oneonone fight for 
the democratic presidential nomination worked to win labor support 
in the industrial states of ohio and pennsylvania today with 
dukakis declaring it would be a tragedy if president reagan 
vetoes a major trade bill 
dukakis and jackson alone in the race after sen albert gore 
jr dropped out thursday were to meet tonight in a debate in 
philadelphia four days before the big pennsylvania primary 
dukakis said at a rally at a ford plant in toledo ohio today 
that the foreign trade bill is the right thing to do and its the 
fair thing to do 
it would be tragic he told reporters later at the airport if 
the bill were vetoed because of a mild plantclosing provision 
reagan has said he will veto the bill if it arrives on his desk 
with a provision to require all but the smallest employers to give 
60day notice of plant closings and largescale layoffs 
on thursday dukakis and jackson both aimed new criticism at 
embattled attorney general edwin meese iii 
gore abandoned his presidential bid on thursday vowing to do 
all he could to help put a democrat in the white house 
the nominee is going to be michael dukakis or jesse jackson 
im going to do everything i can to help them the only man i 
want to stop is george bush gore said at a washington news 
conference with his family at his side 
the tennessee senator suspended his campaign technically 
remaining a candidate to permit his delegates to attend the 
democratic national convention gore who had not won a primary or 
caucus since super tuesday march 8 ended his effort more than 
15 million in debt 
on the republican side bush was coping with the kind of 
scheduling glitch that either of his democratic rivals would envy 
it looked as if he would clinch the number of delegates needed to 
nominate a little sooner than his staff had thought 
aides to the vice president had been planning to celebrate the 
big moment on may 3 the date of primaries in ohio indiana and the 
district of columbia but they made it clear that the development 
would be more than welcome whenever it came 
delegate counts maintained by both the associated press and the 
bush campaign indicated bush could secure the 1139 needed to 
nominate in the next few days he now has 1058 to 17 for pat 
robertson bushs only remaining rival according to the ap count 
minnesota republicans were selecting 15 delegates this week 
nevada republicans will choose another 20 on saturday and there 
are 78 delegates at stake in tuesdays pennsylvania primary 
at this point its pretty much concluded the race is 
over robertson said thursday in nevada 
even though he has given up on the nomination the former 
television evangelist expressed determination to make his mark on 
the gop in nevada his supporters were dominating the state 
convention and bidding for top state party posts 
jackson was campaigning today in pennsylvania where polls have 
suggested he is running well behind dukakis in tuesdays primary 
178 delegates are at stake 
i always run against great odds jackson said 
campaigning in the northwestern pennsylvania city of erie 
jackson courted bluecollar workers with a call for economic 
justice 
profits are up wages are down factories are closing and 
workers are abandoned he told a crowd of about 4000 people in a 
downtown park who braved a cold wind off nearby lake erie 
lets rebuild america and put the workers back to work 
dont let the voices of the status quo break your spirit jackson 
said he also called for changes in the national labor relations 
board saying it should be a mediation service and not a 
strikebreaking board 
jackson also renewed his criticism of meese who is the target 
of a yearlong criminal investigation and under pressure from some 
quarters to quit the attorney general said thursday there is no 
factor he knows of right now that would cause me to resign 
i want a justice department that stands for justice an 
attorney general that goes back and forth to court as a prosecutor 
for the people and not as a defender for himself jackson said 
dukakis slammed meese as he campaigned in cleveland on thursday 
ohios primary follows pennsylvanias by a week and offers 159 
delegates 
like jackson dukakis highlighted labor issues he was visiting 
an auto plant in ohio and a steel plant in pennsylvania today 
we have a labor department and an nlrb national labor 
relations board that wont stand up for america because we have 
got an attorney general who couldnt tell the difference between 
antitrust and antifreeze dukakis said 
the massachusetts governor bidding for bluecollar support 
added were going to pass a strong plantclosing law that will 
give our workers the notice the training and the benefits they 
need to find new jobs with good wages when plants shut down 
jackson also made his trademark antidrug appeal as he 
campaigned in philadelphia accompanied by mayor w wilson goode 
he walked through a neighborhood notorious for drug sales and 
sounded his familiar down with dope up with hope theme 
dukakis and bush were neckandneck in national poll results 
released today by usa today and cable news network dukakis got 45 
percent support to bushs 43 percent a difference that fell 
within the surveys 33 percentage point margin of error 
dukakis lost support when jackson was listed as his 
runningmate with bush getting 49 percent support to dukakiss 42 
percent the survey of 900 voters was conducted after tuesdays new 
york primary

a 16yearold boy accused of the ax 
murders of his parents brother and sister will be tried as a 
juvenile a judge ruled today 
olmsted county judge gerard ring denied a state petition to have 
david brom tried as an adult and ordered that the teenager remain 
in detention until he can be placed in a juvenile detention home in 
rochester 
olmstead county attorney ray schmitz said he would appeal the 
ruling to the state court of appeals 
brom has been charged with murdering his parents bernard and 
paulette brom and siblings ricky and diane at the familys 
cascade township home feb 18 
for a juvenile to be tried as an adult in a criminal case state 
law requires the prosecutor to show that the child is not suited to 
treatment and is a danger to the community the judge said neither 
standard was met in the brom case 
i think the facts speak for themselves in terms of his 
dangerousness schmitz said 
if tried as an adult and found guilty of firstdegree murder 
brom would have been sentenced to life in prison with parole 
eligibility in about 17 years under the juvenile court system if 
he is found guilty he will be released when he turns 19 or when he 
has been rehabilitated whichever comes first 
in a 20page memorandum accompanying his ruling the judge 
called the case one of the most perplexing cases i have been 
involved with in my 16 years as a judge 
i am faced with a crime which the prosecution has described as 
one of the most vicious and brutal multiple murders in the history 
of the state ring wrote at the same time i have an accused 
who is a child of 16 years with no prior court record and who is 
described by a courtappointed psychiatrist as quite deferential 
polite and compliant 
ring said he assumed at the beginning of the court proceedings 
that brom would probably be certified as an adult 
in this case there was no lack of proof that the crime was 
terrible the evidence was graphic and plentiful the judge 
wrote however the evidence as to the child was totally 
different 
he was normally funny to a point of being a problem at times 
in class ring said in his ruling he was never aggressive or 
assaultive to anyones recollection when slapped by his father he 
did not fight back even when knocked over a table he did not 
exhibit any signs to most of those who knew him that he could do 
the awful things that he apparently did 
at a recent reference hearing psychiatrist carl malmquist 
testified that brom suffers from severe depression he also told 
the court that there is no assurance treatment could be complete by 
the time he is 19 
however psychologist james gilbertson said the teen could be 
successfully treated for his depression within that time frame 
even if he is not treated gilbertson said the boy would pose no 
risk to the general public in almost all circumstances

black leaders say they will end a 
10week boycott of whiteowned businesses now that the school board 
has decided to reassign a controversial football coach and athletic 
director 
hollis rutter hired from a white private academy was 
reassigned as administrative assistant to the superintendent after 
the board voted 41 in a special meeting thursday he also was 
given a twoyear contract extension 
we achieved but none of us has won anything the rev od 
evans spokesman for a group called concerned citizens told about 
250 jubilant protesters after the fivehour board meeting 
weve all got to live here together he said weve all 
got to heal the wounds weve got to inflict wounds to achieve 
something its going to take several weeks to get it down where 
the pots not boiling 
the board had previously voted 41 in support of rutter 
superintendent goerge brumfield who had vowed wednesday to ride 
out the protest cited a walkout by 197 of the schools 800 
students tuesday as the reason for the sudden turnaround 
until the students walked out this week i had no intention 
and coach rutter had no intention of changing our minds 
brumfield said after the meeting 
reading from a statement brumfield said rutter thought when 
the protest first started it would only be for a short duration and 
not cause a disruption of the school system and the community that 
proved to be incorrect 
blacks initiated the boycott when rutter was hired at the 
primarily black school in january after spending the previous two 
years at allwhite brookhaven academy originally the boycott 
called for black students to boycott extracurricular activities 
but it later was expanded to a general boycott of whiteowned 
businesses 
spring football training held in february or march by most 
schools was moved to april 25 in an effort to weather the boycott 
rutter acknowledged that two of three black baseball players who 
started the season dropped off the team in support of the boycott 
many of the 16member boys and 10member girls track teams also 
quit because of the boycott

the us attorney in philadelphia told a 
senate committee today that the cosa nostra is on the run in 
his city with most of the organized crime leadership under 
indictment or in prison 
however edward sg dennis jr said that despite the successful 
prosecutions the mob is down but not out in philadelphia 
testifying before the senate permanent subcommittee on 
investigations dennis said of his citys organized crime family 
i dont think it will pass from the scene very easily or very 
quickly 
dennis described how the philadelphia cosa nostra turned 
increasingly violent after the murder of its former chieftain 
angelo bruno who was shot to death outside his home on march 21 
1980 brunos assassination led to a series of mob murders and 
subsequent prosecutions and convictions 
the reputed current boss of the philadelphia family nicodemo 
scarfo was convicted on extortion and conspiracy charges and 
sentenced in august 1987 to 14 years in prison 
he is on trial in philadelphia along with seven cosa nostra 
members on charges of killing a former capo in the scarfo 
organized crime family 
we certainly have the mafia on the run in philadelphia and 
elsewhere dennis said 
at present most active members of the philadelphiasouth jersey 
cosa nostra are either under indictment in custody or both if 
successful this series of prosecutions could effectively remove 
the lcn la cosa nostra from criminal activity in philadelphia 
for at least the immediate future he said 
government crime fighters from new york and new jersey told the 
subcommittee earlier that organized crime is no longer dominated by 
gangsters of italian origin but by a more deadly mixture of 
other ethnic immigrants 
james r zazzali a member of the new jersey state commission of 
investigation told senators thursday that of 29 organized crime 
organizations operating in his state only seven of these are 
mafia gangs 
zazzali said that the problem of newly emerging groups in 
5to10 years may be the major problem in organized crime 
what we are experiencing now in new jersey in the northeast 
indeed in every metropolitan area of this nation is an evolution 
of organized crime from domination largely by gangsters of sicilian 
or other italian origin since the 1930s to an even more deadly 
mixture of other ethnic immigrants he said 
the groups include american blacks asians colombians cubans 
jamaicans and russians said zazzali and ronald goldstock director 
of the new york organized crime task force motorcycle gangs have 
also become a force in organized crime they said 
goldstock said that even now the colombian drug cartels are a 
much greater problem than the traditional la cosa nostra he said 
organized crime in the united states has changed for these reasons 
use of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act 
a radically new approach that allows prosecutors to focus on the 
illegal enterprise as a crime rather than the individuals who run 
it 
before its enactment in 1970 there was an endless war of 
attrition in which one mob leader was simply replaced with another 
now entire upper echelons of families have been indicted and 
convicted 
the breakdown of the code of silence by mobsters faced with 
prosecution forfeiture of assets and incarceration several 
elder statesmen became media stars not only through testimony 
but by writing books such as man of honor by joe bonnano and 
the last mafioso by jimmy the weasel fratianno 
disputes between organized crime groups have grown in number 
and seriousness as the leadership has become more inexperienced and 
unstable 
goldstock referred to new organized crime leaders as mob 
yuppies to whom financial considerations are more important than 
the traditional codes of discipline that existed in the oldline 
organized crime families 
by the late 1970s for many family members traditional values 
had been replaced by simple costbenefit analysis he said

japanese leaders reacted sharply today to the 
approval of an omnibus trade bill by the us house of 
representatives and urged president reagan to veto it quickly 
the bill passed thursday by a vote of 312107 targets foreign 
markets closed to us industry 
the government of japan will continue to reiterate its 
apprehension to the us side the administration in particular 
hoping strongly that such a bill will not be enacted foreign 
minister sosuke uno said 
hajime tamura minister for international trade and industry 
charged that antijapanese sentiment was behind the action 
kyodo news service reported 
chief cabinet secretary keizo obuchi in a nationally televised 
news conference warned that japanus relations and the world 
economy would suffer if the senate approved the bill 
he said however i have strong expectations that in the final 
stage the bill will not be passed the senate included 
the bill which the senate was to begin debating friday 
includes two provisions regarded as threatening to japanese 
business 
one provision gives us trade representative clayton yeutter 
power to decide what constitutes unfair trade practices by another 
country and what to do about it another imposes sanctions against 
toshiba corp and its subsidiary toshiba machine co which sold 
submarinesilencing equipment to the soviet union in violation of a 
western trade agreement on sensitive technology exports 
hajime tamura minister for international trade and industry 
said he deeply regretted passage of the omnibus trade bill i 
am expecting that president reagan will take veto action he said 
while i do not think it will be passed in the senate in the 
end i will urge the us administration to block the bill and 
await the common sense of the american people tamura said 
the bill shorn of many features criticized as too protective of 
us industry included a controversial item opposed by reagan the 
provision which reagan said will move him to veto the entire bill 
called for advance notice in the event of certain plant closings 
and employee layoffs 
but it lacked what for japan would have been a more damaging 
amendment which would have imposed sanctions against countries 
that the united states judged to have achieved large trade 
surpluses through unfair means

a federal judge ruled that the trademark of 
chili appreciation society international inc belongs to a group 
that sought stricter rules in the traditional chili championships 
held at terlingua in west texas 
but us district judge lucius bunton refused to get involved in 
which camp could claim to be the official cookoff of the chili 
world 
bunons ruling thursday means that the name chili appreciation 
society international inc belongs to a group headed by ray king of 
poteet 
bunton waxed poetic in his opinion saying some like it hot 
some like it cold some like it in the pot nine days old when it 
comes however to good stout chili if you dont like it hot 
youre just plum silly 
kings group sued the late frank x tolbert who began the chili 
cookoff in 1967 that is held in the big bend area complaining that 
the rules of the cookoff were not specific enough 
in 1983 the two camps began holding their own cookoffs on the 
same day both flying the banner of the chili appreciation society 
international 
bunton ruled that king had registered the name as a federal 
trademark and therefore tolbert had no right to use the name 
casi inc is to pay tolberts heirs 1500 for the trademark 
but the defendants must pay court costs no attorneys fees were 
awarded 
bunton found that prior use of the trademark by tolbert did not 
constitute infringement but that future use by anyone other than 
the king group would 
bunton noted that he has no authority over the parties as to 
whose cookoff would be the official cookoff of the chili world 
the parties should see this as an issue of good sense and 
decency and not look to the courts he said 
the court is confident that members of the groups will take 
the view that historically technical distinctions should not be 
imposed to prevent the widest possible participation in the event 
which has as its purpose social interaction and charitable aims 
he concluded

an estimated 30 minority students 
took over the deans office at williams college today the eve of 
parents weekend at the prestigious liberal arts school a 
spokesman for the group said 
the spokesman who declined to identify himself said black 
hispanic asian and polynesian students occupied the janness house 
at 830 am when only one member of the deans staff was in the 
building and the group was not allowing anyone but minority 
supporters inside the building 
shortly after noon dean of the college stephen fix issued a 
statement saying that college officials were prepared to meet with 
the students 
in recent weeks senior members of the administration have met 
with these students and have offered repeatedly to hold further 
meetings with them to discuss their concerns and to report on a 
variety of initiatives the college is taking to achieve the 
important goals we share fix said all of us in the college 
are prepared to continue such discussions in any atmosphere that is 
conducive to the free and open exchange of ideas 
however college spokeswoman ellen berek said she did not know 
if any meetings had been arranged 
the group occupying the building calls itself the coalition 
against racism education 
the students have vowed to stay in the office until the college 
responds to their demands for increased minority hiring and other 
grievances presented to college president francis oakley in 
february the spokesman said 
after receiving inadequate response we decided this action 
was necessary the spokesman said 
reading from a prepared statement he said we took this 
action to protest the administrations unwillingness to address 
substantially fundamental issues relating to minority concerns at 
the college 
these issues relate to recruitment hiring goals and policies 
with regard to minority faculty staff and students they also 
relate to the broader issues of minority representation in the 
curriculum the statement said 
the protesters also said they were upset that the university 
reneged from its stance of disinvestment advocacy in companies 
doing business in south africa 
minority students at the university of massachusetts and 
hampshire college in amherst more than 40 miles southeast of 
williamstown occupied buildings on their campuses for several days 
in february to protest racial discrimination at those schools 
those protests ended after the heads of the schools signed 
agreements with the students to increase funding of minority 
projects and make other concessions

the first round of the presidential campaign ended 
friday with a burst of speeches and all indications said president 
francois mitterrand and premier jacques chirac would make it to the 
runoff 
more than 383 million people are registered to vote in sundays 
election mitterrand 71 a socialist seeking a second sevenyear 
term is expected to finish well in front the contest is to 
determine who will face him in the runoff may 8 
chirac 55 mitterrands conservative premier was in second 
place according to final polls under french law no opinion polls 
can be published in the week immediately before an election 
former centerright premier raymond barre 64 who led all 
rightist candidates for most of the past year has stumbled badly 
since february but maintains he still has a chance they 
shouldnt sell the bearskin until the bear has been killed he 
said 
friday was the last day of the twoweek official campaign 
no further radio and television appearances are permitted and no 
political rallies can be held 
there are nine candidates running in the first round 
although the final polls showed mitterrand would defeat either 
chirac or barre in the runoff chirac had narrowed the gap in the 
latest surveys 
chirac and barre both have pledged to throw their support behind 
the bestplaced conservative in the effort to unseat mitterand 
the important thing is to defeat socialism and its candidate 
francois mitterrand said conservative interior minister charles 
pasqua speaking at a political meeting the time has come to get 
rid of socialism which has proved its incompetence 
if as is most likely the runoff is between mitterrand and 
chirac the big question is how much of barres vote and that of 
extreme right national front leader jeanmarie le pen will switch 
to the premiers camp 
a significant number of le pens supporters are communists 
unhappy with their partys proimmigrant stand they could return 
to their natural leftist inclinations in the runoff barres 
backers include a large number of centrists who may not support 
chirac 
the biggest unknown is the still large number of undecided 
voters one poll said up to 20 percent were undecided 
mitterrand who scheduled his final big political rally of the 
campaign for friday night at paris le bourget airport has 
distanced himself from the socialist party he founded and led for a 
decade 
during the final years of his first administration he has also 
abandoned his anticapitalist rhetoric and moved toward the center 
recently he has been increasing harsh on chirac calling him 
ultra conservative and linking his views with those of le pen 
and others on the extreme right 
the language of the campaign has been generally vague with few 
specific proposals from any of the candidates le pen said he was 
stunned by the mediocrity the inexistence of political debate 
in one of his final television appeals mitterrand repeated one 
of his few specific proposals a minimum guaranteed wage which he 
said would be partly financed by reimposition of a tax on large 
fortunes 
the wealth tax was instituted by the socialists in 1981 and 
repealed by the conservatives after they won the 1986 legislative 
elections and took control of the national assembly 
chirac stressed defense in one of his last speeches while 
saying disarmament should be a priority he emphasized that the 
first steps had to be made by the superpowers 
if we did not have our nuclear deterrent we would be the 
hostages of eastern europe he said of frances small atomic 
force 
in reality the positions of the three major candidates are 
strikingly similar all stress the importance of 1992 when the 
single european market legally goes into effect all speak of the 
need to reform the education system and promote scientific and 
technological research to defeat unemployment all want to reduce 
taxes and ensure that the poorest frenchmen are cared for 
the differences are mainly a matter of nuance and style 
the final polls showed mitterrand leading in the first round 
with about 3537 percent chirac with 2224 percent barre at 1617 
percent and le pen with 1112 percent 
also running are andre lajoinie the official communist 
candidate pierre juquin leader of a splinter communist reform 
movement arlette laguiller a trotskyist antoine waechter an 
ecologist and pierre boussel another trotskyist

for 23yearold ciaran hall a 
roman catholic whose entire life has been caught up in the violence 
of belfast finding a job has become an impossible dream 
all my life ive been unemployed he said ive tried 
everything now to get a job i even tried to be a street cleaner 
but there doesnt seem much likelihood theres too much 
prejudice 
northern irelands overall jobless rate is 17 percent nearly 
double mainland britains catholics although 40 percent of the 
provinces 15 million population suffer 2 times more 
unemployment than protestants 
in mainly catholic west belfast unemployment is about 47 
percent with pockets as high as 86 percent for young men 
the british government is under pressure from local community 
and religious leaders the moderate catholic social democratic and 
labor party and the irish government to tackle unemployment and 
urban decay in west belfast 
they argue that the area is a recruiting ground for the outlawed 
irish republican army because many of its 100000 residents have no 
jobs live in poor housing and are in constant friction with the 
security forces 
people only turn to paramilitary organizations in desperation 
only when they are a last option said dan keenan a spokesman 
for the catholic social democrati labor party if you do give 
them a chance treat them with decency humanity and give them 
jobs i think you will find support for the ira withering away 
the government has unveiled draft legislation to stamp out bias 
by making companies monitor the religious makeup of their work 
forces it also threatens criminal charges against those who make 
insufficient effort to recruit minority workers 
but the laws will not go into effect before next year and 
critics say they are not tough enough 
the ira fighting to end british rule and unite the province 
with the overwhelmingly catholic irish republic regards factories 
shops and offices as legitimate targets attacking dozens even in 
their west belfast stronghold the fireblackened shells of the 
lake glen hotel and a number of stores in the heart of the district 
stand as reminders of past ira gasolinebomb attacks 
the rev matthew wallace told mourners at the funeral of a 
catholic man killed by a protestant extremist that the nations 
leaders must stop talking and do something to alleviate the great 
deprivation in west belfast 
for many young people unemployment is their lives and that is 
an indictment of those who look after us those who govern our 
country wallace said unless something is done we will be 
celebrating a lot more funerals 
northern ireland secretary tom king britains chief minister in 
the province said this month that the government is working on 
proposals for the economic regeneration of west belfast but details 
have not been disclosed 
one proposal before the government would finance the creation of 
up to 20 companies employing 30 to 50 people each which would be 
owned initially by the west belfast enterprise board 
we hope that if we can prove that business can operate safely 
in the area that we will be able to entice outside investment into 
west belfast said john carlin a board member who teaches at the 
college of business studies 
west belfasts major employer is the royal victoria hospital 
the area never had an industrial infrastructure and its old textile 
and spinning factories stand idle the only two major 
governmentsubsidized businesses in west belfast the us 
delorean auto company and strathern audio ventures both failed 
the government has financed various youth training programs but 
surveys show that over 80 percent of the trainees fail to get jobs 
when the courses end 
ciaran hall said he was forced to quit a bricklaying course 
after being hit between his eyes by a police plastic bullet in 1981 
five years later he completed a threemonth toolmaking course 
run by a private company in a protestant area in 1986 but wasnt 
kept on 
i was a catholic so i didnt have much chance he said in an 
interview outside the welfare office in west belfast 
these last two years ive done nothing just walked the 
streets and sat in the house thats it its depressing i 
would do anything at all you name it id do it he said

the nationalist government friday freed 
about 6000 prisoners and reduced jail terms for about 16000 
others to commemorate the 100th day after president chiang 
chingkuos death 
under the mass commutation 19 political prisoners were released 
from jail and sentences were cut for 11 others according to 
justice ministry officials 
ministry officials said the release of the 6054 prisoners 
including gangsters drug addicts and corrupt officials began at 
dawn after brief ceremonies at jails around the island 
each prisoner was given a red package containing about 17 to 
wish them luck they said 
television showed the prisoners some smiling and some tearful 
met by anxious wives children and other relatives waiting in 
drizzly weather outside the jails 
president lee tenghui proposed the commutations in february 
after succeeding chiang who died of heart failure on january 13 
lee the first native taiwanese to head the nationalist government 
spent part of the day at rural tahsi southwest of taipei paying his 
respects at the late leaders masoleum 
many analysts believed lee would be an ineffectual figurehead 
after the end of the authoritarian chiang kaishek family dynasty 
but lee a lowkey vice president under chiang chingkuo has 
emerged as a popular leader of growing influence who has maintained 
a high profile since becoming president 
lee was named acting nationalist party chief to replace chiang 
just two weeks after the former presidents death and is widely 
expected to be named party chairman at a congress in july 
hes not as powerful as president chiang and he may never be 
but hes not a figurehead hes done better than some people 
expected lu yali a political science professor at national 
taiwan university said in a recent interview hes aware there 
isnt any serious rival to him 
lee has spent much of his time pushing his predecessors policy 
of introducing democratic change chiangs reevaluation of 
taiwans relationship with communist china also is continuing 
chiang chingkuos father chiang kaishek brought the 
nationalists to taiwan after the chinese communists chased them 
from mainland china in 1949 his party still claims to be the 
rightful ruler of all china 
the nationalist government still prohibits official contact with 
china but increasingly tolerates unofficial links such as indirect 
trade and travel to the mainland to visit relatives 
among the released political prisoners friday were six taiwanese 
businessmen sentenced in 1984 and 1986 to 10 to 12 years in jail 
for visiting mainland china for business purposes justice ministry 
officials said 
another released political prisoner was 47yearold pai yachan 
who was sentenced in 1975 to life imprisonment for distributing 
leaflets calling on chiang chingkuo then chairman of the 
governing nationalist party to reveal his wealth and to recall his 
daughter from the united states to show his confidence in taiwan 
after arriving at taipeis domestic airport from a jail on green 
island 180 miles southeast of taipei pai tearfully told reporters 
he was grateful for those people who fought hard for human rights 
and ending political oppression he said he wanted to join 
opposition politics 
under fridays commutation death sentences were reduced to life 
imprisonment life sentences to 15 years and lesser sentences were 
cut by onethird or onehalf many prisoners released already were 
serving sentences reduced when martial law was lifted in july 
justice ministry official huang shihmin said the commutations 
affected all but a few hundred prisoners sentenced for firstdegree 
murders ammunition smuggling and other crimes that could 
endanger national security and social stability 
two political prisoners did not have their sentences reduced 
because they were accused of being communists officials said two 
men jailed earlier this year for advocating an independent taiwan 
were not affected by the commutation because the verdicts are under 
appeal

cardinal john j oconnor said there has been a 
serious proposal that he celebrate a christmas mass in moscow that 
would be televised throughout the soviet union 
the new york prelate mentioned the proposal thursday at a news 
conference called to discuss his meeting with cuban president fidel 
castro but he declined to reveal any details about the proposal 
including who made it 
oconnor was talking about his hope that the church might be 
given access to governmentcontrolled airwaves in cuba then he 
added 
i might just use as a parallel that there has been a serious 
proposal to me that on christmas day i offer mass in moscow with 
the promise that the mass would be televised throughout the soviet 
union 
it would seem to me that if that could happen the potential 
for the church to communicate very freely here would be turned into 
a real possibility he said 
joseph zwilling a spokesman for the new york archdiocese said 
friday he did not know about the proposal 
oconnor also said castro indicated that hundreds of political 
prisoners could be freed from cuban jails if the united states gave 
them visas 
the cardinal who held three hours of talks with the cuban 
leader before dawn thursday said castro welcomed the possibility 
of having a representative of the american catholic church act as a 
liaison between the prisoners and us authorities in order to 
speed up the visa process 
oconnor said castro told him there were 453 political prisoners 
in cuba 
i think he indicated that a very very large proportion of 
those could be released from prison quite quickly if visas were 
granted by the united states and that it is important that if they 
are released they leave the country immediately oconnor said 
the roman catholic cardinal said the president also agreed to a 
request for more visas for foreign nuns but did not give a 
specific figure 
oconnor said the two also discussed the possibility of 
uscuban cooperation in health care particularly the fight 
against aids 
the cardinal said he stressed to castro that the church 
transcends politics 
i told the president frankly that i think he had a tremendous 
opportunity to use the church in the right sense of the term i 
told him it certainly should not be exploited oconnor said 
in response oconnor said castro praised the american church 
for its work and spoke glowingly of the pope 
oconnor was asked whether castro might allow the church access 
to the governmentcontrolled airwaves 
i would hope that that would be one of the things that would 
happen in the not too distant future he said 
earlier oconnor told reporters i feel that the mission was 
accomplished and that the president recognized clearly my primary 
purpose in coming here 
he described that goal as showing the solidarity of the church 
throughout the world and its dedication to peace 
a meeting with castro had been expected reporters were hustled 
from the wednesday night mass celebrated by the cardinal and taken 
to the presidential palace where they were told castro had agreed 
to a photo session with the visiting prelate 
at 1130 pm a foreign ministry spokesman said castro had 
canceled the photo session because oconnor arrived late

the internal revenue service announced today it 
has revoked the taxexempt status of the troubled ptl ministry 
the announcement follows a court ruling earlier this week 
dissolving a preliminary injunction that had prevented the irs from 
taking such action 
les witmer a spokesman for the irs regional office in atlanta 
said the action was taken because we felt the organization has 
not operated within the guidelines in its original charter 
he said court papers filed in conjunction with ptls bankruptcy 
proceedings indicated that individuals in the organization had 
profited substantially from donations made to the ministry and that 
ptl had excessive unrelated business income or income which was 
not really in keeping with the taxexempt purpose 
linda ivey a ptl spokeswoman said ministry officials were not 
immediately available for comment 
an irs statement said the agency can no longer assure 
taxpayers of the deductibility of contributions to ptl effective 
immediately 
past contributions are fully deductible however it said and 
if ptl appeals the action to federal court contributions by 
individuals would still be deductible up to 1000 until the appeal 
is decided the irs said 
in any event however contributions to ptl are not deductible 
by any individual who was in whole or part responsible for the 
activities on the part of the organization that were the basis for 
the revocation the statement said generally this would not 
include the ptl partners and contributors 
the irs said it would reevaluate the situation if ptl is 
reestablished or forms a new exclusively charitable organization 
ptls troubles began in march 1987 when its founder jim bakker 
resigned amid allegations of sexual improprieties the ministry 
based in fort mill sc filed for reorganization in federal 
bankruptcy court in june 1987 
on wednesday the 4th us circuit court of appeals in richmond 
va affirmed a federal judges ruling that the bankruptcy court 
did not have the authority to issue a preliminary injunction 
preventing the irs from revoking the ministrys taxexempt status 
ptl trustee david clark said then that the ministry was 
considering additional appeals

president reagan said today that attorney 
general edwin meese should not resign and has not offered to 
despite a facetoface meeting in which two departing justice 
department officials told the president that meeses behavior is 
hurting his department 
the president walking to the white house after a nearby meeting 
on an unrelated subject was asked about the troubles of his 
attorney general 
should meese resign a reporter asked 
no said the president 
has he offered to 
no 
the president was then asked if the justice department was 
running well 
just fine he replied 
earlier reagans chief of staff howard baker told an 
interviewer 
we dont know what will happen next all we know is that the 
attorney general is functioning and functioning well and that the 
president expressed his continuing confidence 
baker was referring to reagans meeting with meese wednesday 
which sources said came minutes after one of the two aides told the 
president that an aggressive prosecutor would seek meeses 
indictment 
one of those aides deputy attorney general arnold burns burns 
said today he and former criminal division chief william weld had 
a marvelous conversation with reagan burns said the president 
was very candid 
it was a very very frank exchange of ideas that we had with 
him and hes got to make his decision in his way in his own time 
and im confident that he will do it said burns 
burns meeting with reporters on his last day on the job said 
i have to confess to you that it is indeed a very sad day 
during the 45minute discussion called by the president burns 
told reagan vice president george bush baker and white house 
counsel ab culvahouse that meeses behavior was hurting the 
department of justice an administration source said 
weld meanwhile laid out the facts in a hypothetical 
indictment he said he would have brought against meese if he were 
the special prosecutor investigating the attorney general said the 
source speaking on condition of anonymity 
burns told reagan that meese had violated the standards of 
ethical conduct for executive branch employees spelled out in a 
1965 executive order and that if other justice department attorneys 
had acted as meese has they would be bounced fired the 
source added 
the ethical standards among other things say that employees 
should avoid any action which could create the appearance of using 
public office for private gain giving preferential treatment to 
any organization or person or making a government decision outside 
official channels 
the president was very attentive listened to the story got 
up and meese came in after burns and weld left said the source 
the washington post today quoted a source who also requested 
anonymity as saying reagan commented that he would not make any 
decision about meeses future until independent counsel james c 
mckay finishes his report on the attorney general 
since last may 11 meese has been the subject of a criminal 
investigation by mckay who has been examining meeses assistance 
to scandalplagued wedtech corp and a proposed 1 billion iraqi 
oil pipeline project at the behest of longtime friend e robert 
wallach also under investigation are meeses meetings with 
regional bell telephone company executives at a time when he owned 
14000 in baby bell stock and wallachs role in securing a 
40000ayear job for meeses wife 
in an interview published in todays usa today and conducted 
before word of his meeting with reagan became public meese said 
the president continues to express his total support and 
total confidence 
the attorney general told the newspaper he meets the highest 
ethical standards expected of public officials and knows of no 
factor right now that would cause me to resign 
at the justice department today spokesman patrick korten said 
he would have no immediate comment 
a department source close to meese speaking on condition of 
anonymity said that the meeting between reagan and meese lasted 
longer than the one involving burns and weld and that the president 
had expressed full support for the attorney general 
in the meeting with reagan burns told the president that 
wallach who is under indictment in the wedtech scandal had taken 
advantage of his relationship with the attorney general to promote 
his own business interests said the administration source 
burns while not using these specific words in effect told 
reagan that wallach was selling the office of the attorney 
general the source added 
during the white house meeting weld told reagan that if he were 
the special prosecutor in the criminal investigation of meese he 
would seek an indictment of the attorney general said the source 
weld had made similar comments to meese on march 29 when weld 
and burns announced to the attorney general that they were quitting 
out of concern that the nearly yearlong probe of meese has damaged 
the justice departments operations morale and image 
according to the source weld in his meeting with reagan laid 
out the facts in a hypothetical indictment 
in the past said several administration sources weld has told 
justice department associates that he feels a number of felony 
charges could be lodged against meese based on the evidence known 
to date these would include conspiracy counts and involve the 
acceptance of illegal gratuities a violation of ethics in 
government act provisions spelling out conflicts of interest and a 
violation of the foreign corrupt practices act barring bribes to 
foreign officials the sources said 
according to the sources welds legal analysis in part revolves 
around 
a september 1985 memo to meese from wallach in connection with 
the iraqi pipeline mentions planned payments to the israeli labor 
party of thenprime minister shimon peres meese says he doesnt 
recall reading the portion of the memo regarding planned payments 
a 150000 legal fee paid by one of the partners in the oil 
pipeline to wallach which ended up in a stock trading account owned 
by w franklyn chinn meeses financial manager chinn in effect 
pooled wallachs money with that of meese and a few other 
investors enabling him to buy large amounts of brandnew stock 
issues and sell them on the same day usually at a substantial 
profit 
three months before the fee went to wallach meese had referred 
his longtime friend to thennational security adviser robert 
mcfarlane who directed subordinates to try to facilitate an 
insurance package to enable the pipeline to be built chinn turned 
a 40000 profit for meese on a 50000 investment in just 23 stock 
trades over 18 months meese says that under the partnership with 
chinn all financial details were kept secret from him

senate democrats put their congressional 
campaign spending limits proposal on the shelf friday after losing 
another attempt to overcome republican opposition and force a vote 
on the issue 
fiftythree senators including four republicans voted to 
invoke cloture or end debate but this was seven votes short of 
what is needed to suspend the senates unlimited debate rule 
this was the tenth time since last june that majority leader 
robert byrd dwva lost a cloture on the divisive issue 
the first eight attempts came over a bill that would have 
established a voluntary system of limits for senate campaigns 
the latest losses on thursday and friday prevented a vote on a 
proposal by sen ernest hollings dsc to amend the constitution 
to overcome a supreme court ruling that mandatory limits violate 
free speech rights 
byrd said after fridays attempt that six of the 10 absent 
senators would have voted for cloture leaving him within 
striking distance of the needed 60 votes 
he said that while he was pulling the issue from the floor 
members shouldnt assume that he would not bring it back in the 
future 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said republicans dont 
oppose placing limits on campaign spending but as a group dont 
want to tamper with the constitution or vote for any legislation 
that would favor democrats 
im willing to try to work out some bipartisan measure that is 
fair acrosstheboard and doesnt discriminate against anybody 
dole said we are spending too much money 
he and sen mitch mcconnell rky said that even if byrd 
succeeded in winning cloture for the proposed constitutional 
amendment it was unlikely the measure could get the 67 votes 
needed to pass the senate

sixth graders who fed an 
experimental rat a steady diet of junk food and watched him 
deteriorate into redeyed lethargy say theyre convinced the road 
to good living isnt paved with tasty treats 
but there was one problem with the experiment the junk food 
rat honey outlived his companion nut who was fed only health 
food nut died while choking on a cracker as the results were 
announced thursday 
he was extremely healthy a distraught kathie dilks assured 
her class at harrison township elementary school the teacher 
announced that they would provide nut with a proper burial 
the experiment had been slated to last another 3 weeks but 
even with nuts death the results have already convinced students 
like paul amiss 12 to heed the good nutritional points his mom 
has been making for years 
she likes me to eat healthy stuff so i can grow healthy if 
you eat too much junk food you wont grow up paul said adding 
that all the hoopla probably wont stop him from enjoying a candy 
bar once in awhile 
i usually eat them for dessert he whispered out of the 
earshot of the adults who were busy explaining the results of the 
first 10 days of the fiveweek experiment 
the test showed that a steady diet of junk food caused a baby 
white rat to grow at a slower rate than a companion rat who was fed 
the schoollunch menu ms dilks said 
honey who dined on oreo cookies red licorice and orange 
marshmallows appeared lethargic and sleepy during a news 
conference at the southern new jersey school an open can of stale 
soda waited nearby in case honey grew thirsty 
rats cannot burp when you feed them soda you have to make 
sure its flat said julie mcgrath a registered dietitian with 
the philadelphiabased blue ribbon services inc the foodservice 
company that sponsored the experiment 
honey frisked and twitched around his glass cage when not dozing 
its probably a sugar high ms dilks said 
honey who weighed in at 455 grams also looked a tad dingy 
hes a little yellow hes not getting enough nutrients said 
12yearold mark plum as he escorted the redeyed rodent around the 
classroom 
nut the rat who munched on tossed salads bananas and pizza 
weighed in at a whopping 78 grams prior to his sudden death and 
showed substantial tail growth 
we want to apply this to our own eating habits ms mcgrath 
told 16 nodding heads who offered examples of how the test changed 
their lives 
orange juice and cheese appears to be the new afterschool snack 
for the majority of the class except 11yearold nelson irizarry 
nah my mom doesnt let me eat junk food anyway he said 
ms mcgrath said she would obtain two more rats to complete the 
experiment before school ends in june

melanesian separatists stormed a 
police station friday and fled with 26 police hostages after a 
battle that left three french officers dead and about 20 people 
wounded 
more than 20 kidnappers attacked with guns and knives on the 
small island of ouvea about 90 miles northeast of noumea capital 
of this french pacific territory they demanded that 300 police 
reinforcements be withdrawn and that paris send an emissary to 
discuss independence 
officials said friday night that negotiations had not begun and 
that police had not been in contact with the attackers who fled 
into the bush with their captives a massive search was under way 
the attack came two days before a territorial election on a new 
autonomy plan for the archipelago coinciding with the french 
presidential elections 
native melanesians known as kanaks make up 43 percent of the 
territorys 145000 people the rest are european settlers 
polynesians and asians 
many melanesians seek independence and most european settlers 
want to remain french trouble first broke out in november 1984 and 
has erupted sporadically since then leaving 31 people dead 
in other incidents thursday and friday the city hall of paita 
was set on fire and power lines were blown up near canala two 
grenades were thrown at a separatist radio station in noumea and a 
shot was fired at a police vehicle no injuries were reported in 
the incidents 
the attack on ouvea a 100squaremile atoll with a population 
of about 2800 was carried out about 7 am by 20 to 30 men in the 
village of fayaoue 
families of the policemen who lived at the station were not 
attacked and suffered no injuries officials said the station 
itself was sacked and a large amount of unspecified equipment 
stolen 
among the wounded were three policeman one in critical 
condition with a bullet wound in the back of the head and three of 
the attackers one listed in serious condition police said the 
seriously injured were evacuated to noumea 
in paris the government of premier jacques chirac vowed to 
reestablish order as quickly as possible 
instructions have been given to dispatch the necessary 
reinforcements to the island of ouvea said bernard pons 
minister for overseas territories after an urgent meeting between 
chirac and ministers directly concerned 
the government cannot accept attacks on policemen that they 
kill them and take them hostage pons said it will not allow 
things to get worse 
leopold joredie security minister of the selfproclaimed 
government of kanaky said in a telephone interview that he had 
been in contact with a leader of the attackers 
the gendarmes held by the people in ouvea are in good 
health joredie said there are no wounded among them they are 
all well treated 
he said the attackers refused to negotiate while police 
reinforcements remained on the island 
jeanmarie tjibaou leader of kanak socialist national 
liberation front the main separatist organization told the 
associated press by telephone he did not know of the attack in 
advance 
tjibaou called the incident frightful but said it was not 
surprising in that demands for independence are absolutely not 
taken into consideration that people are scorned and the 
government refuses to listen to them 
tjibaous organization which is boycotting the elections also 
boycotted last years referendum on independence saying only 
melanesians should be allowed to vote the territory voted 
overwhelmingly for france

president reagan charged today that the 
democratic leadership of congress has caved in to organized 
labor on key issues of the trade bill that he has threatened to 
veto 
reagan told the legislative exchange council a group of 
conservative legislators that the plantclosing provision in the 
bill would cost american jobs by hurting industry 
the provision would require industries to give 60 days notice to 
employees of plant closings 
id like to be able to sign trade legislation this year the 
president said ive worked in good faith with congress to 
produce an acceptable bill 
put simply on key provisions in the tradd bill the 
democratic leadership in congress has caved in to pressure from 
organized labor he said the plantclosing restriction in the 
bill would make american industry less competitive not the way to 
go if you want to redress the trade imabalance and save jobs in 
fact the restriction would cost jobs 
reagan quoted an unnamed washington lobbyist as saying of his 
veto threat i think hes crying wolf 
try me the president told the group if this bill is 
unloaded on my desk ill stamp it reject and ship it back to 
where it was made 
majority leader robert c byrd said he was not sure the bill 
would pass the senate by the twothirds majority needed to override 
a threatened presidential veto 
but byrd said reagan when deciding whether to veto it should 
not presume the senate could quickly strip out provisions opposed 
by the white house and pass another version 
byrds comments came as the senate began debate on the bill the 
result of a housesenate compromise between competing versions the 
measure rolled through the house on thursday by an overwhelming 
312107 vote 
the administration ought to pay close attention to the 
whopping majority of that vote byrd said i think the house 
vote will give added momentum to its supporters in the senate 
byrd said he could only hope that if reagan vetoed the bill 
the senate could find the twothirds majority needed to override 
the presidents lobbyists were working hard against it he said 
if the presidents veto were sustained and the senate forced to 
bring forward a new bill it would have to rerun the obstacle 
course the current compromise has already cleared he said the 
president should assume this is it it wont get another 
chance said byrd dwva 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas 
defended the measure as providing the trade policy the nation needs 
we havent had a trade policy since world war ii and 
did without one while the united states was the worlds dominant 
economic power he said but that time has changed and now were 
in tough competition 
before debate began opponents of the bill asked for assurances 
of adequate debate time byrd said the vote would not occur before 
tuesday evening 
byrd again warned that an administration favorite the pending 
freetrade agreement to phase out tariffs between the united states 
and canada could get entangled in any reagan veto 
reagan said thursday that he will veto the bill if it arrives on 
his desk with a provision to require all but the smallest employers 
to give 60day notice of plant closings and largescale layoffs 
business groups have fought the plantclosings provision on 
grounds it would dry up capital for investment frighten off 
customers and cause economic stagnation unions are calling for the 
measure saying that notifying employees about to lose their jobs 
is the only humane thing to do 
in recent days the dispute over plant closings has overshadowed 
the centerpiece features of the bill which would streamline the 
system under which the united states aids companies threatened by 
imports and retaliates against international trade violations 
scores of other provisions range from repeal of the windfall oil 
profits tax to sizeable agricultural subsidies 
a key vote in the house came just before the roll call on final 
passage when lawmakers voted 253167 against a move by minority 
leader robert h michel rill to send the measure back to 
conference committee with orders to drop the plantclosings 
provision 
on the final vote on the bill itself the hefty house margin 
reflected concern in northeastern states over import competition 
and perhaps electionyear reluctance to fight anything billed as 
sharpening the us edge in global markets 
on the roll call 244 democrats backed the bill and two opposed 
it reps richard a gephardt dmo said it should go further and 
include something similar to his amendment to roll back japanese 
trade surpluses rep robert j mrazek dny said the bill 
contained too much protectionism 
sixtyeight republicans voted for the bill and 105 opposed it 
there were heavy defections among new york new jersey and 
pennsylvania republicans 
the lawmakers spent most of the afternoon leading up to the vote 
arguing over the plantclosings provision 
this amendment is obviously a nongermane counterproductive 
hitchhiker thats going to get this bill vetoed rep william 
frenzel rminn said we can exorcize this demon 
rep augustus hawkins dcalif called the bill too important 
to get hung up on an issue such as plantclosing notifications he 
said it ought to be viewed as a relatively minor amendment because 
it is so modest it has been so watered down and it contains so 
many exceptions that it probably would not do as much as its 
supporters hoped 
i want to talk about plant openings not plant closings said 
rep tom delay rtexas 
but house speaker jim wright dtexas called on lawmakers to 
imagine how their families would be affected if they suddenly lost 
their jobs he called for approval of the bill with the 
plantclosings provision intact

actress marlee matlin in a letter to the new 
york times has complained about its coverage of her appearance at 
the academy awards 
during her appearance on the oscar program miss matlin who is 
deaf spoke without using sign language the times article on 
april 13 said some people viewed that as a blow not only to deaf 
people but also to the goal of total communication 
i do not sign and speak simultaneously and when i chose to 
sign alone with an offcamera voice or to speak alone as i did 
on the oscar ceremony telecast i could have potentially ignored 
two major segments of the deaf community those who use speech and 
do not sign and those who sign and do not use speech she wrote 
fortunately the telecast was closed captioned and 
everyone regardless of communication preference had access so 
whats the big fuss read the letter which appeared friday 
the star of children of a lesser god closed her letter with 
a complimentary ps but thank you for the nice picture

an infant taken from a hospital four 
hours after his birth has been found and a texas couple have been 
arrested in the case 
a policeman involved in the recovery happened to be the infants 
godfather and namesake 
albert cecil dwayne lewis 25 and judy k lewis 32 both of 
crowell texas were arrested in holbrook after the infant was 
found early thursday in the back seat of a car said police capt 
bob reed 
the infant was taken wednesday from yavapai regional medical 
center in prescott apparently by a woman masquerading as a 
hospital laboratory worker police said the woman told the mother 
she was taking the baby for tests 
mrs lewis said in a court appearance in holbrook that she was 
forced into participating in the abduction because her husband 
wanted a baby 
the lewises were returned to prescott where they were being 
held in yavapai county jail in lieu of 137000 bail each on 
charges of kidnapping burglary felony endangerment and custodial 
interference 
yavapai county sheriffs capt robert carson said today that he 
was notified this morning that the initial three charges had been 
amended late thursday to include the kidnapping count he said 
earlier today that prosecutors were studying whether the couple 
could be charged with kidnapping 
douglas gerwitz newborn son of lisa and john gerwitz of the 
payson area was discovered after mrs lewis asked holbrook police 
for travelers aid such as gas money and a place to stay sgt 
stewart bracke said 
she said she was alone but officer douglas newton the childs 
godfather and namesake discovered she was traveling with a man and 
a baby bracke said 
its a heck of a coincidence newton said 
police found the couple and the baby matched descriptions from 
the prescott case and were able to confirm the babys identity in 
three hours 
bracke said the boy was taken to holbrook community hospital 
where he was pronounced in good health 
yavapai hospital administrator michael vitek said the woman who 
took douglas apparently masqueraded as a technician by dressing in 
a lab coat 
lab coats are in the nurses lounge and on hall trees in the 
ob department hospital policy is that when our ob nurses go to a 
different part of the hospital they put on the lab coats to 
minimize infections vitek said 
he said hospital officials will review the entire package of 
hospital policies relating to security of infants

the chance to hunt a lion is the lure of 
larry wilburns ranch but its making some of the neighbors 
nervous 
ive gotten some phone calls from a few people who have heard 
rumors about lion hunts and are worried about them said jack 
white a cove councilman their main fear of course is what if 
the lion gets loose and starts roaming 
wilburn says his lions are no more dangerous than the wild boars 
already living in the boggy area of southeast texas 
my lions have been raised in captivity said wilburn who 
offers 20 species including deer sheep and antelope for hunting at 
his three ranches 
he buys his lions from people who bought them when they were 
cute cuddly cubs 
the ones i get are usually past their prime said wilburn 
theyre old and mean and not useful any more the zoos usually 
cant use them and they were destined for the gas chamber when i 
get them 
some residents dont like the idea of having lions in the area 
im very nervous about anybody turning loose a lion in the 
marsh said chambers county clerk beanie rowland now ill be 
worrying whenever i hear my dog bark or my grandchildren go to play 
in the back yard 
the hunts are conducted on a 400acre area in the marsh called 
lawrence island which is surrounded by bayous canals and 
waterways wilburn said 
state officials says it is legal to hold a lion hunt on private 
property but not on the adjoining federal land 
wilburn said he has booked six lion hunts in the last year 
those who do it usually have a lot of money to play with 
said wilburn who charges 2500 to 3500

the jury that found him guilty in february of conspiring to traffic 
in cocaine but innocent of a cocainetrafficking charge 
im going up to the big house with the biggest sentence 
anybody has gotten in this case said the 41yearold pilot from

a redeyed brazilian fly was turned 
loose friday in an experimental effort to control the mole cricket 
which chews up 47 million worth of crops and lawns each year 
the first release of 250 fly pupae in an alachua county pasture 
will probably be followed by others throughout the summer said 
howard frank director of the project at the university of 
floridas institute of food and agricultural sciences 
were optimistic but the whole thing is a big experiment 
said frank 
the mole cricket which probably arrived by ship from south 
america damages vegetation by tunneling through it 
the pest is now spreading into georgia alabama and south 
carolina frank said 
the brazilian fly about the size of a house fly comes to the 
mating call of male mole crickets and lays her living larvae on or 
near the singer the larvae then burrow into the male and his mates 
ten days later the mole cricket is dead said tom walker the 
ifas entomologist who will monitor the progress of the brazilian 
fly 
we should know in a year if the larvae are surviving said 
frank and in two years well have a reasonable idea of whether 
its a success 
the us department of agriculture granted permission to release 
the flies after laboratory tests demonstrated they only attack mole 
crickets 
the fly is the third biocontrol agent that ifas has unleashed in 
florida against mole crickets 
a wasp that subdues mole crickets but does not sting people was 
the first turned loose in 1981 near fort lauderdale the colony is 
holding its own there they mainly attack a tropical mole cricket 
that is only a pest in south florida however 
nematodes microscopic worms were released in 1985 and 1986 in 
several alachua pastures offspring are still there and seem to 
have caused a decline in mole cricket populations at the release 
sites but frank says the nematodes are harder to handle than the 
brazilian fly

iraqs recapture of the faw peninsula from 
iran this week provided baghdad with a major political victory 
despite the limited military value of the dusty uninhabited 
wasteland 
the successful attack on the peninsula extending from southern 
iraq into the persian gulf robbed tehran of a key bargaining chip 
that could be used if the countries ever negotiate for peace 
its insignificant as far as the military situation is 
concerned a baghdadbased western diplomat said of the iraqi 
victory but psychologically it had been the needle in their 
flesh 
the iraqis are not unnaturally hailing their recovery of faw 
as one of their greatest military triumphs in the 7yearold 
persian gulf war while analysts doubt that they concede it has 
given baghdad a big morale boost 
the elite presidential guard and the 7th army corps smashed 
through iranian lines north of faw on sunday by monday afternoon 
they had seized full control of the peninsula that dominates iraqs 
two main outlets to the gulf the shatt alarab and the khor 
abdullah waterways 
iran captured about 12 miles of the peninsula in february 1986 
stunning iraq which failed in repeated bloody counterattacks to 
retake the flatlands iran renamed faw city an abandoned refinery 
town alzahra and held a wrestling tournament there last year to 
emphasize its grip 
although iran still occupies other small chunks of iraqi 
territory along the 730mile border faw was its prize 
the loss of faw turned iraq into a landlocked country and 
iraq likes to think of itself as a gulf country said a western 
analyst in baghdad speaking on condition of anonymity 
the war began in september 1980 partly because of a 
longstanding dispute between iran and iraq over who controls the 
shatt alarab the gulf outlet of the tigris and euphrates rivers 
faw gave the the iranians dominance on both sides of the waterway 
iraq was thinking of faw when it insisted on full application of 
a measure from the united nations security council that demanded 
that the two countries withdraw to prewar international boundaries 
as part of a ceasefire the analyst said 
iran also had faw largely in mind when it balked at the un 
measure 
it was the most important card the iranians held in the 
scuffle for position over a possible peace settlement the analyst 
said 
the faw battle also broke iraqs strategy of static defense 
whereby iraqi troops would sit behind formidable protection and 
wait for iranian attacks 
the iraqis who invaded iran in 1980 had stuck to that strategy 
since they were driven back across the border in 1981 so much so 
that many analysts had doubted they were capable of mounting an 
offensive 
the iranians may have thought the same and let their guard drop 
iraqs only significant assault into iran in recent years was in 
may 1986 when its troops captured the deserted and weakly held 
border town of mehran on the central front in retaliation for the 
loss of faw 
but victory turned quickly to debacle when iran regained the 
town a month later capturing much of the iraqi force that had 
failed to seize the high ground around it 
reporters who toured the faw battleground immediately after its 
recapture found few signs of the fierce handtohand combat that 
normally characterize iranian fighting 
there were few bodies lying around and only a handful of damaged 
tanks and artillery pieces to be seen 
iraqi officers told reporters that iran had about three 
divisions on the peninsula between 10000 and 25000 men far less 
than the 50000 previously thought to be based there 
faws chief strategic value was that it bottled up iraqs small 
navy by lining artillery along iraqs only remaining outlet to the 
gulf the khor abdullah the shatt alarab to the east had been 
closed since the early days of the war 
but even that had only a limited value since the iraqi navy has 
played little part in the war since its early phases 
faw also gave iran a platform closer to kuwait from which it 
could launch missile attacks iran has accused kuwait of aiding 
iraq 
the diplomat also speaking on condition of anonymity said iran 
apparently captured an iraqi missile battery on faw which it used 
to fire chinesemade silkworm missiles at kuwait whose capital is 
50 miles southwest of the peninsula 
but iran showed tuesday that it could hit kuwait from iranian 
soil when it fired a sovietdesigned scud missile into uninhabited 
desert near an oilfield

yugoslavias economic crisis is 
threatening its socialist system and needs an infusion of new 
ideas a highranking communist party official said friday 
the depth of the unvanquished crisis in many places brings in 
question the issue of socialism as a whole said milan kucan the 
leader of the slovenian communist party changes radical ones 
are more than necessary kucan made the comments during a speech 
to 421 delegates to the provincial party conference which opened 
friday 
he called on the party to allow open debate without 
restoration of the classical bourgeois parliamentary political 
parties of western democracy 
yugoslavia is a singleparty communist state 
an increasing number of critics including authors philosophers 
and sociologists from serbia have been pressing for introduction 
of a multiparty system in the country as a way out of its current 
economic and social crisis 
communists in slovenia the countrys most prosperous republic 
have been the most outspoken in offering unorthodox solutions to 
the countrys problems including introduction of a more 
marketoriented economy and closer ties with western europe 
yugoslavia has a 20 billion foreign debt unemployment is at 15 
percent living standards are declining and inflation is at 170 
percent 
joze knez vicechairman of slovenian parliament on wednesday 
called on the federal government to resign because of its failure 
to cope with the crisis 
the current yugoslav constitution adopted in 1974 during the 
rule of the late communist leader josip broz tito created a sistem 
of eight virtually independent communist parties one within each 
of the countrys six constituent republics and two provinces 
the central committee of the party excercises nominal control 
over its regional branches but is in fact often reduced to serving 
as a forum where regional differences are aired

a seashell collector found a bundle 
of 800 papers about the us nuclear submarine fleet at a naval 
base in scotland a newspaper reported today 
but the us navy said the papers apparently found near the holy 
loch base contained no classified information 
the scotsman based in edinburgh said the papers contained 
details of the running costs and the maintenance of the 10 
lafayette and benjamin franklin class submarines operating out of 
holy loch the largest us submarine base outside the united 
states 
the 10 submarines are armed with poseidon and trident nuclear 
missiles 
a woman collecting shells at helensburgh seven miles from the 
high security base picked up a black plastic bag that contained 
the bundle of papers the newspaper said 
the newspaper said the papers contained financial details on the 
refitting of three submarines at the base the amount given for 
servicing and engineering at holy loch and items needed for the 
submarines and for the submarine support vessel uss simon lake 
in a statement issued in washington the navy said the bag was 
routine refuse that fell ashore by accident and contains only 
routine maintenance and logistics documents 
it is easy to understand given the incomplete and cryptic 
nature of the data in the refuse how it could have been 
misinterpreted it said 
holy loch is the principal us submarine base in europe and is 
of key strategic importance to the western nato defense alliance 
the base is wholly operated by the us navy which employs more 
than 1700 personnel there

an effort by two bookstores to get a list 
of books used at baylor university is turning into a legal battle 
that could force the private school to open most of its records and 
files to public scrutiny 
state sen carl parker chairman of the senate education 
committee has asked the attorney general to issue an opinion on 
whether the baptist university in waco is a governmental body 
subject to the texas open records act he notes that the university 
receives 36 million in state aid in the form of tuition grants 
if baylor is declared a governmental body because it accepts 
state funds parker then asks whether the textbook list should be 
made available to the public under the state open records act 
so far baylor officials have refused to give the textbook list 
to bear bookstore and the university bookstore two private stores 
offcampus 
although parkers legal inquiry is narrowly focused on the 
textbook issue it could affect all texas colleges affiliated with 
religious denominations said carol mcdonald president of the 
independent colleges and universities of texas inc a group of 39 
private schools 
abner mccall baylor president emeritus said if he can get 
that textbook list he can get most of the records out here 
under current interpretations of the open records act private 
schools such as baylor are not obligated to make records and files 
available to the public 
the state shouldnt be able to look at all the records of any 
private organization mccall said 
in a legal brief filed with attorney general jim mattox baylor 
lawyer newton jones of dallas argued that baylor isnt a 
governmental body because it is not supported in whole or in part 
by public funds 
funds from the texas equalization grant and student incentive 
grant programs are sent to students not the university jones said

a prosecutor says he foresees no major hurdles in 
holding a third trial for a man twice sentenced to death in the 
kidnap rape and killing of his niece more than 10 years ago 
the death sentence of john charles zimmerman jr 41 was thrown 
out wednesday by the texas court of criminal appeals 
zimmerman was convicted of capital murder in 1977 and again in 
1979 for the death of 10yearold ramona ann abner of jacinto city 
former assistant harris county district attorney ken sparks who 
prosecuted zimmerman at both trials was angry about the reversal 
the responsibility for this reversal rests squarely on the 
shoulders of allan r jamail and the jacinto city police department 
for the way they mishandled the confession he said 
jamail former jacinto city police chief and now mayor of the 
town in the houston area denied forcibly obtaining zimmermans 
confession to the march 24 1977 slaying and said sparks better 
be able to back up those statements 
jamail called the conviction reversal a miscarriage of 
justice 
this has been painful on mrs abner her daughter would be 18 
had it not been for zimmerman he said theres enough evidence 
to support the death penalty again 
in its 81 decision the appeals court said the second trial 
judge improperly allowed into evidence letters written by zimmerman 
to his wife sherry after he was in custody the letters in which 
zimmerman admitted killing his niece wound up in the hands of his 
motherinlaw who sent them to another daughter who forwarded them 
to investigators 
the court ruled that the letters were confidential communication 
between husband and wife and that their introduction as evidence 
violated a provision of the law that one spouse cannot give adverse 
testimony against another 
prosecutors will ask for a rehearing harris county district 
attorney john holmes said because of changes in the socalled 
spousalimmunity statute which now permits such adverse 
testimony 
holmes said he expects no problems in trying the case again 
because most of the states witnesses are current or former law 
enforcement officers 
according to trial testimony zimmerman took ramona a 
thirdgrader from school on the day of the killing telling a 
teachers aide there was a family emergency 
the next day he led police to the girls body a 10inch 
butcher knife was found where he said he had thrown it 
zimmerman made oral and written confessions to the crime but 
later alleged he had been slapped hit and shocked with a cattle 
prod by jacinto city police 
a jacinto city police dispatcher testified that she typed 
zimmermans confession and that jamail told zimmerman everything to 
say she also said she saw an officer hit zimmerman 
jacinto city council fired jamail and a federal grand jury later 
indicted him and two other officers on charges they abused two 
prisoners questioned in the abner case all three were acquitted in 
1979

responsible for his death are said john linder it was part of 
a policy a policy that begins right here in the united states

republican national chairman frank fahrenkopf 
jr and former television evangelist pat robertson called for party 
unity but discord was obvious as the nevada state gop convention 
convened friday 
ruralcounty delegates expressed dismay at what one termed 
gestapo tactics by robertsons nevada organizer steve wark 
who helped engineer a robertson takeover of the state party 
leadership 
but wark said the gripes were unwarranted and he said he had 
been begging people to stay involved rather than telling them 
they were being replaced by robertson supporters 
fahrenkopf told the convention that republicans who think a gop 
presidency is certain this election year are dead wrong he 
said democrats are in a doordie campaign and will use smear 
tactics to assure a victory 
he accused democratic frontrunner michael dukakis of duplicity 
in his statements on issues including taxation defense spending 
and lawandorder legislation 
the republican chief also said its incomprehensible to him that 
jesse jackson the most radical candidate for the presidency 
ever could be running a close second behind dukakis 
fahrenkopf said the old and the new faces in our party must 
unite and work to defeat our common enemy which he described as 
liberals who dominate the democratic party 
fahrenkopf said after his speech he wasnt embarrassed that a 
robertsondominated delegation would come from nevada to the 
republican national convention in new orleans this summer despite 
the fact that vice president george bush apparently will be the 
presidential nominee 
robertson echoed fahrenkopfs remarks about uniting to defeat 
democrats winning applause from most of the state convention 
delegates with the obvious exception of a crowd of rural delegates 
he called for a return to quality education based on moral 
teachings and an end to progressive education that is getting 
progressively worse 
and robertson also spoke against drug dealers organized crime 
and radical homosexual activists and said he was opposed to 
legalized abortion or any efforts to block help to the nations 
elderly 
many of the delegates began singing god bless america as 
robertson wrapped up his 25minute speech and left the room 
delegate curtis patrick a member of the state gop executive 
committee and a former state party chairman accused wark of 
gestapo tactics in changing party rules and cutting off rural 
delegates from participation 
patrick said an executive committee session late thursday turned 
into a shouting match after wark told old guard republicans 
they were out of power 
this weekend the republicans will finish picking a 20member 
delegation to the national gop convention at least 16 of those 
national convention delegates will be robertson delegates

a deposed and exiled honduran 
military chief charged with overseeing death squads is under house 
arrest after he returned from the united states as a bornagain 
christian 
gustavo alvarez martinez who cooperated in us policy against 
leftist nicaragua headed honduras armed forces from 1982 until he 
was disarmed handcuffed and put on a plane out of the country by 
mutinous subordinates march 31 1984 
the former general returned april 9 from miami where he has 
lived for the past four years on tuesday he was placed under house 
arrest in his luxurious home in the florencia norte suburb of this 
capital 
alvarez who was dishonorably discharged and stripped of his 
rank in an unprecedented display of his comrades ire is charged 
in connection with the disappearance of about 130 suspected 
leftists and the killings of about 30 others 
if anyone thinks they have evidence against me let them take 
it to the courts he told journalists at his home the day after 
his arrival i have found tranquillity and fear nothing and no 
one except god 
alvarez 50 said some of his erstwhile subordinates may have 
kidnapped or killed suspected subversives and now its being 
placed at my feet 
the exgenerals wife and five children remain in miami and plan 
to join him in june 
that is unless criminal court judge saul suazo lara who is 
hearing alvarez case takes the unlikely step of ordering him 
jailed suazo must decide next week whether to imprison alvarez on 
the basis of available evidence or dismiss the case 
jurists say the charges will likely be dropped they say that 
even if there were evidence against him alvarez would benefit from 
a late1984 amnesty preventing prosecution for such crimes 
an associated press reporter went to alvarez grand twostory 
home in an effort to speak with him but a guard who relayed the 
request returned to say the former commander decided to make no 
further comment to the press 
alvarez told journalists the day after his arrival those who 
threw me out of this country thought they were throwing me in the 
garbage but they threw me into the arms of the lord and made me a 
new man 
a former roman catholic he said last year in miami that he 
converted to evangelical christianity in 1985 after rereading the 
bible he described the vivid anguished recollection of all the 
wrongs hed ever committed and hours of uncontrollable sobbing 
but mothers of the victims of death squads that emerged under 
the staunchly anticommunist general reject his professed 
conversion 
he cannot hide behind the bible said liduina hernandez 
whose 23yearold son enrique disappeared in 1982 christ died 
for the truth so let alvarez begin by telling the truth about what 
happened to our sons and daughters 
mrs hernandez is president of the committee of relatives of the 
disappeared one of two rights groups pressing the case against 
alvarez she and several other mothers commented at a press 
conference wednesday 
it was under alvarez command that the reagan administration 
consolidated its use of honduras in the effort to topple 
nicaraguas leftist government usfunded rebels established base 
camps in honduras along the nicaraguan border and the contras waged 
most of their 6year campaign from there 
the us also established the regional military training center 
in northern honduras during alvarez tenure the center now 
defunct was used mainly to train government forces from el 
salvador in counterinsurgency techniques 
a year before his expulsion alvarez formed the association for 
progress in honduras a group of politicians and business leaders 
the organization was seen as a vehicle for the generals political 
ambitions widely believed to include the presidency 
but alvarez told journalists after coming back that once his 
legal problems are resolved he wants to dedicate himself to a 
normal and private life removed from politics he said last 
week he would like to settle down in the northern coastal town of 
la ceiba and find some sort of business to earn me my beans

advocates of redesigning the nations pennies 
nickels dimes and quarters held out the prospect friday that 
excited coin collectors would hand the treasury a multibillion 
dollar deficitreducing windfall profit 
but the director of the us mint testifying before the senate 
banking commttee predicted only smallchange proceeds ranging in 
the millions of dollars not billions 
sen alan cranston dcalif said any profit from a redesigned 
coin would be welcome 
i suspect that glimmer of black ink in our deficitplagued 
world is in itself adequate reason for passage of this bill he 
said 
sixtyone senators and 90 house members have cosponsored 
legislation authorizing the most sweeping redesign of the nations 
coinage since the early years of the century 
the bill would require a complete redesign of the tails of the 
coins while reserving the heads for the five presidents presently 
displayed there 
while the presidential portraits might themselves be somewhat 
redesigned the coins would retain their present size shape and 
color 
the bill requires the design of the tail of the quarter to carry 
for two years a design commemorating the bicentennial of the 
constitution 
cranston said he would like to make some changes in the plan and 
said he will introduce a pair of amendments to do that 
he would reserve the face of two of the coins for a symbolic 
design and forbid their use to portray any person living or dead 
that would mean that two of the five presidents now so honored 
lincoln on the penny jefferson on the nickel roosevelt on the 
dime washington on the quarter and john f kennedy on the 
halfdollar would lose their places in the nations pockets and 
purses 
cranston said no president was featured on the nations coins 
until 1909 when abraham lincoln was granted the honor on his 100th 
birthday 
presidents franklin d roosevelt dwight d eisenhower and 
kennedy got their coins within a year of their deaths cranston 
said 
cranston said he would also offer an amendment to enhance the 
value of the redesigned coins as educational tools by directing 
that they be designed as symbols of such democratic principles as 
freedom of speech freedom of the press due process of law trial 
by jury the right to vote and the separation of powers 
coins are the most tangible symbols of our nation in our daily 
lives cranston said we touch them examine them carry them 
around in our pockets and purses in all our waking hours 
people particularly young people will look at our coins and 
learn what they stand for 
diane wolf a member of the us commission of fine arts who has 
been campaigning for redesigned coins for more than a year has 
said the change could result in a 23 billion profit over six 
years 
the bill requires all profits be used to reduce the deficit 
david c harper editor of numismatic news a coin collectors 
magazine testified that the 23 billion estimate resulted from 
his calculation of profits of the release of the coins at face 
value compared to their relatively low production prices and the 
separate sales of mint and proof sets to collectors 
it is clear to me the government will make money on design 
changes he said only the size of the profit is undetermined 
but donna pope director of the us mint had far lower 
estimates 
embellished revenue estimates of 23 billion have been cited 
and some have looked to coin redesign as a panacea for budget 
deficits she said 
based on analyses of past demand patterns we estimate 224 
million in additional receipts will be generated in the first 
six years of the new designs and 18 million in additional profits 
over the same period from sales to coin collectors 
the mint director suggested that if a decision is made to change 
the design of us coins the changes should be made over a sixyear 
period with a new coin being issued at the beginning of each year

emotions but has been unable to sell the house 
we saved this place 12 years ago when we bought it and 
preserved it said anderson

association of which mrs upton was treasurer 
the group was a leader in the fight for womens rights 
including the 19th amendment which granted women the right to vote 
anderson said several people are interested in obtaining pieces 
of the structure and a buyer is interested in the lot for an office 
building 
anderson and richard stoerkel bought the 14room house in 1976 
and began restoration they put it on the market several years ago

president pw bothas new 
plan to expand blacks political role was denounced friday as vague 
and inadequate but even some critics credited him with courage 
for all their limitations in the eyes of black activists the 
proposals sent a clear message to extremeright whites that botha 
was willing to risk their wrath in pursuit of his version of reform 
parliament members of the farright conservative party victor 
over bothas national party in three recent byelections depicted 
the presidents plan as dangerous and said he was selling out the 
white man 
black power is lying in wait for you said the 
conservatives leader andries treurnicht youre walking 
straight towards it 
in a speech to parliament on thursday botha proposed black 
participation in cabinetlevel policymaking and on the electoral 
college that selects the president he suggested that blacks who 
now may vote only in local elections could select their 
representatives in regional balloting 
black and white moderates criticized bothas vagueness and his 
reluctance to bring blacks into parliament but they praised his 
willingness to challenge the far right which consists primarily of 
the presidents fellow afrikaners 
as limited as the state presidents thought is it will be 
used against him by the far right which he now tentatively begins 
to defy said zulu leader mangosuthu buthelezi 
colin eglin leader of the antiapartheid progressive federal 
party softened his usual denunciations of botha to say his party 
although skeptical wished the president success in starting 
negotiations with leaders of the nations 26 million blacks 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which blacks have no vote in national affairs the 5 
million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts 
schools and health services 
more militant antiapartheid leaders were unimpressed by bothas 
speech which did not address blacks fundamental demands for full 
voting rights and abolition of apartheid laws 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu described bothas proposals as 
slight adjustments to the evil system of apartheid 
it wont help if the government merely moved furniture around 
because the room would remain the same tutu said at the close of 
a fourday visit to britain 
reform will not come by big master throwing to us crumbs of 
conscience that fall from his table the black archbishop said 
it will happen when all the people in south africa are able to 
determine the menu together when they sit at the same table 
botha returning to parliament on friday to explain aspects of 
the presidential budget veered from his text to defend his 
political proposals 
blacks he said cannot be wished away abracadabra as the 
conservatives might hope he said blacks would have to be brought 
into the government and given a voice in choosing a president 
but botha also stressed that white voters have a say on the 
proposal to include blacks in the electoral college 
a referendum on this issue would present whites with a clear 
choice between the national party and the conservatives who oppose 
any concessions to blacks and favor a strengthening of the 
apartheid laws that create a racially segregated society 
the conservatives won 26 percent of the vote in the white 
general election a year ago and they are predicting further gains 
in nationwide municipal elections scheduled for october 
the vast majority of conservative supporters are afrikaners the 
mainly dutchdescended whites who traditionally have been loyal 
national party backers 
some political analysts in the country say botha has decided to 
abandon the farright afrikaners in hopes he can attract enough 
support from englishspeaking whites to offset the loss about 60 
percent of the 5 million whites are afrikaners and the rest are 
predominantly englishspeakers

a former fbi agent told senators friday that 
he almost became the first bureau member initiated into la cosa 
nostra but his sixyear undercover assignment was ended abruptly 
due to a gangster civil war 
joseph d pistone said he would have become a made member of 
new york citys bonanno family in december 1981 but he was pulled 
out of the mob by his fbi superiors after he was ordered to kill a 
gangster from a rival faction 
the fbi felt and so did i that this was a good time for 
getting out because everybody was being killed pistone said 
but for a brief time pistone said he sought permission to 
continue the assignment so he could make fbi history 
fbi spokeswoman kathy bradford said that to this day no agent 
has ever penetrated deep enough into a mob family to be a made 
member rather than an associate 
pistone testified from behind a screen before the senate 
permanent subcommittee on investigations the panels chairman 
sen sam nunn dga said the retired agent has been relocated 
from new york and changed his appearance 
members of the sicilian mafia and la cosa nostra in this country 
have used the screen for protection in recent hearings the 
committee is looking at the state of organized crime 25 years after 
exmobster joe valachi testified for the first time about the inner 
workings of mob families 
pistone who wrote a book about his life as gangster donnie 
brasco said the new york mob was so upset when it learned his real 
identity that some of his former allies were murdered and new 
rules were instituted to thwart future undercover penetrations 
they have reinstituted the requirement that before someone is 
made a soldier he will have to make his bones that is he will 
have to kill someone pistone said 
in addition they are now requiring two wiseguys organized 
crime members to vouch with their own lives for the new member 
rather than as before when only one did so 
the mob had reason to be upset pistones subsequent testimony 
resulted in more than 200 indictments and more than 100 convictions 
of organized crime members 
pistone said there was a surprising similarity between the 
workings of organized crime families and terrorist organizations 
the families were broken down into small separate cells called 
crews a strict need to know policy was enforced with no one 
asking what other members were doing and not giving each other 
their last names 
pistone described the life of a cosa nostra soldier in new york 
as routine and unglamorous with most of his time consumed trying 
to make money for himself and his mob family 
they didnt think or talk much about their wives girlfriends 
families hobbies pistone said 
every day you would have to check in with your captain 
there was no such thing as taking a couple of weeks off for 
vacation unless you first had your captains approval 
pistone said mobsters believe in god not in going to church 
but they believe in the church killing was part of the business 
every mafia member has in his head that he may be wacked out 
killed 
in other testimony the us attorney in philadelphia said the 
cosa nostra was on the run in his city with most of the 
organized crime leadership under indictment or in prison 
however edward sg dennis jr said that despite the successful 
prosecutions the mob was down but not out in philadelphia 
the reputed current boss of the philadelphia family nicodemo 
scarfo was convicted on extortion and conspiracy charges and 
sentenced in august 1987 to 14 years in prison 
he currently is on trial in philadelphia along with seven cosa 
nostra members on charges of killing a former capo in the 
scarfo organized crime family 
at present most active members of the philadelphiasouth jersey 
cosa nostra are either under indictment in custody or both 
he said

the reagan administration said friday it will 
soon submit a bill to transfer administration of the federal family 
planning program from the department of health and human services 
to the states 
assistant hhs secretary robert windom said the shift would 
enable states to exercise maximum flexibility in tailoring 
services to more appropriately and effectively meet their citizens 
family planning needs 
in testimony to the house energy and commerce subcommittee on 
health windom said certain federal requirements would be retained 
among them a ban on use of funds for abortionrelated services and 
priority on serving lowincome families 
windom said that by running their own programs states could not 
only improve services but could also avoid burdensome 
application reporting and monitoring requirements in the current 
program 
he said legislation proposing the shift would be introduced 
very shortly 
the title x family planning program is awarding 130 million in 
grants this year to 89 groups and agencies operating 4000 clinic 
sites last year the clinics served about 43 million people most 
of them lowincome and about onethird of them adolescents 
the administration is trying to put strict new abortion 
limitations on grant recipients including a prohibition on any 
mention of the word by counselors and requirements for separate 
records staffs and physical facilities for groups or hospitals 
that provide abortions as well as family planning 
the regulations have been enjoined by courts in boston denver 
and new york as a result of lawsuits charging they are 
unconstitutional windom said hhs regional offices have been 
instructed for the time being not to implement them

switzerland ignored repeated us complaints 
and agreed to accredit a new ambassador from iran who was a leader 
of the 1979 us embassy takeover in tehran the state department 
said friday 
the refusal by several other governments to let the iranian 
seyed mohammed malaek serve as a diplomat in their countries also 
failed to deter the swiss from accepting him state department 
spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
our embassy to switzerland on instructions from the 
department of state expressed concern over the presence and 
proposed accreditation of malaek on several occasions to the 
government of switzerland prior to his accreditation as 
ambassador mrs oakley said 
however the government of switzerland agreed to accept him as 
the iranian ambassador she said 
she said malaeks role in the takeover of the us mission in 
tehran was sufficiently well known so that other nations had 
declined to accept his accreditation 
we considered it inappropriate for a leader of the tehran 
hostage takers who abused diplomatic immunities to be himself 
accredited as an ambassador she said 
swiss embassy spokesman paul widmer said friday that his 
government did not have sufficient evidence to reject malaek 
he said any further comment would have to come from the foreign 
ministry in bern 
a state department official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the united states made known its views to switzerland very 
forcefully before malaeks accreditation was accepted and before 
he left tehran to take up his duties in the swiss capital bern in 
march 
the official said the united states even sent a diplomat who had 
been a hostage in iran to tell swiss officials about malaeks role 
in the takeover 
it was to no avail the official said 
in may 1986 the iranians sought to make malaek the chief of 
their 14member diplomatic mission in london but the british 
government refused to let him take the post in return iran 
refused to accept britains nominee as its chief representative in 
tehran 
another state department official said malaek also was rejected 
by canada he said irans nomination of malaek to a post in japan 
was withdrawn after the japanese withheld approval for a lengthy 
period malaeks fourth turndown was a us rejection of his 
attempt to come to new york as an iranian envoy at the united 
nations the official said 
malaek was especially well known to victims of the 19791981 
us embassy seizure because he was one of the leading 
interrogators among the hostagetakers this official said 
foreign service officers and other americans were held in iran 
for 444 days until their release in january 1981 
since then the united states has not had diplomatic relations 
with iran and has used the swiss embassy there to handle any 
necessary dealings swiss diplomats for example were the conduits 
for washingtons recent letter of protest to tehran about a mine 
that damaged the uss samuel b roberts a frigate patrolling the 
persian gulf

hostages released from the hijacked kuwait airways 
jet said friday that iran provided the sky pirates with weapons and 
explosives while the plane was in northeast iran 
its 100 percent obvious that iran was behind the crime let 
there be no doubt about that said khaled nasser zaferi 27 a 
kuwaiti security man who was held captive during the 16day ordeal 
he said a group of men boarded the plane after it landed at 
mashhad airport in iran on april 5 with 112 people on board 
more terrorists boarded the plane at mashhad where they 
produced a submachine gun and explosives they didnt have before 
he told the associated press in an interview at his home 
they were disguised as cleaning workers zaferi said but 
their performance was so bad and unprofessional that most of us 
whispered to each other these must be iranian security men 
zaferi 21 other passengers and seven crew members arrived home 
from algiers thursday one day after they were freed by the 
hijackers at houari boumedienne airport 
the hostages included three cousins of the emir of kuwait 
kuwait airways flight 422 was commandeered on a flight from 
bangkok thailand to kuwait it stopped first in mashhad where 57 
hostages were freed it then went to larnaca cyprus where 13 more 
were released and two hostages were killed 
the plane flew next to algiers algeria where one hostage was 
released due to medical problems 
on wednesday the 31 remaining captives were freed and 29 flew 
to kuwait 
the hostages had demanded the release of 17 convicted terrorists 
jailed for bombing the us and french embassies in kuwait in 1983 
but kuwait had refused to do so 
another captive khaled shamari 32 also a businessman said 
gumnen boarded the plane in iran 
they brought arms and explosives aboard the aircraft he 
said they also brought the plastic straps with which they tied 
our hands 
all the hostages said they did not know that two men had been 
killed in cyprus they said the two were taken to the front of the 
aircraft and then disappeared 
the exact deal that ended the ordeal in algeria is not known 
but arab diplomats have said the hostges slipped away after 
surrendering the boeing 747 and the remaining captives wednesday 
western diplomats have said the hijackers went to beirut but 
officials at beirut airport denied they landed there 
fridays edition of the new york times quoted unidentified arab 
officials as saying the hijackers were flown on a private algerian 
jet to damascus syria and were believed to have traveled overland 
to lebanon 
the officials also were quoted as saying that with the 
exception of one iranian most of the hijackers were thought to be 
lebanese citizens 
zaferi said he knew that the men who boarded the plane where not 
cleaning workers because im an airport security man myself 
but of course i never revealed my real profession to the 
hijackers i told them i am a public relations employee he said 
he said that at the start of the hijacking a kuwaiti passenger 
next to him mubarak sawagh murmured god help me i dont think 
ill survive it this time this is the second time that i endure 
this experience 
sawagh was aboard a kuwait airways jetliner that was hijacked to 
tehran in december 1984 by sky pirates who also demanded the 
release of the terrorists jailed in kuwait 
the hijackers killed two american hostages before the iranians 
stormed the plane 
zaferi said the hijackers more pillow cases as masks they also 
moved the passengers around every few hours 
he said they spoke in several dialects apparently to cover 
their real identity but zaferi added im certain they were all 
lebanese 
shamari said it was very obvious to us that the hijackers 
became tense and savage after leaving mashad 
the hijackers wired the explosives to the doors of the 
aircraft after landing in larnaca he said we felt our doom 
was sealed 
the former captives said they learned they would be freed 
suddenly 
the algerians told us to cheer up because our ordeal was 
over shamari said about half an hour later we were asked to 
leave the plane 
kuwait and other arab countries praised algeria for achieving 
freedom for the hostages without additional violence but the 
united states britain and other western powers criticized algeria 
for allowing the hijackers to get away

a group of minority students and 
university of vermont officials reached agreement friday after 
allnight negotiations to end the students fourday occupation of 
the presidents office 
the agreement calls for the university to add four to 11 
minority faculty members a year for the next four years and to 
double the number of minority students at the school in the next 
four years 
minority recruitment of faculty and students has always been a 
problem for the state university because of vermonts low minority 
population 
university president lattie coor said he was pleased with the 
agreement which sets similar but firmer goals than his original 
proposals 
the agreement came four days after 12 to 16 students occupied 
the presidents wing of the administrative building forcing 
administrators out of their offices during the occupation the 
number of students varied 
the students made some concessions but did achieve all of 
our goals in principle said one of the students eric steinberg 
coor said much of the agreement follows general goals he had 
adopted 
right from the beginning we were on a common ground said 
coor is it better because of this yes but i dont believe it 
required the dramatic step of the occupation to make it occur 
the students who also were on a hunger strike and the 
administration were far apart until three faculty mediators were 
called in thursday night 
of the 8234 undergraduates at the university 40 are black 162 
are asianamerican and 66 are hispanic according to ken fischell 
a university official 
i think weve made a tremendous impact on campus said david 
jamieson of the black student union its created a certain 
dialogue on the issue 
theres a lot of ignorance on this campus because its so 
white said student brad lichtenstein people dont have any 
idea what the real world is like 
jamieson said because there are so few minority students on 
campus issues of racism and cultural diversity are not often 
raised 
i think the biggest problem is lack of committment and lack of 
effort and passivity and ignorance concerning the student body as 
regards to racism he said

three french hostages held by proiranian 
shiite moslems will be freed soon a source close to the syrian 
army command said friday 
their release is a matter of hours all arrangements have been 
worked out said the source who spoke friday evening on 
condition of anonymity 
he said the hostages probably would be freed in the vicinity of 
the seaside summerland hotel in moslem west beiruts jnah district 
where former french hostages roger auque and jeanlouis normandin 
were released last november 
the hotel is close to south beiruts shiite slums where many of 
the 22 foreigners missing in lebanon are believed held it also is 
close to beirut airport 
a chartered swissair executive jet flew to beirut from larnaca 
cyprus and a lebanese security source said it brought syrian 
hostage negotiator omran adham 
but the lebanese police later denied that adham was in beirut 
and said he was not aboard the executive jet 
the planes pilot said after returning to larnaca we went to 
get the hostages but there were no hostages ready so we came back 
to spend the night here 
the pilot said he would fly to beirut again early saturday 
morning he declined to be identified 
the beirut weekly magazine ashshiraa said earlier friday that 
contacts were under way between france and iran for the release of 
three frenchmen held hostage in lebanon 
they are french diplomats marcel carton and marcel fontaine and 
journalist jeanpaul kauffmann the three were kidnapped in 1985 by 
the proiranian islamic jihad or islamic holy war 
a fourth frenchman michel seurat a scientific researcher was 
kidnapped may 22 1985 the islamic jihad claimed it killed him 
march 5 1986 
although no body has been found seurats wife marie said in a 
book she published last month that french officials have confirmed 
to her that her husband died in captivity 
the magazine said paris and tehran had agreed on the release of 
two french hostages in lebanon in return for the release of 
iranian assets frozen in france in addition to a 1 billion 
compensation to iran 
it is believed the magazine referred to full repayment of a 1 
billion loan made by the late shah of iran mohammed reza pahlavi 
to france and disputed interest that could amount to an additional 
1 billion 
last minute snags delayed the release the magazine said 
it indicated that frances insistance on the release of a third 
french hostage held up implementation of the deal 
the april 5 hijack of a kuwait airways jetliner by another group 
of shiite extremists also apparently delayed negotiations 
ashshiraa gained international fame in 1986 when it broke the 
story of secret us arms sales to iran in an atempt to free us 
hostages 
in addition to the french captives 18 other foreigners are 
missing in beirut they are nine americans three britons a west 
german an italian an irishman an indian and two unidentified 
foreign men

aides to george bush said friday the legal 
difficulties surrounding attorney general edwin meese iii have 
become a political liability for bush and have put the vice 
president in an awkward position 
the meese affair and what bush himself refers to as this 
socalled sleaze factor have haunted the vice president on the 
campaign trail hardly a stop goes by without at least one shouted 
question to him on whether meese should resign 
the democrats have seized the issue as ammunition against bush 
who makes much of his role in the current administration and the 
vice president and his advisers say they expect democrats to make 
even more use of the issue as the general election nears 
the bush camp handles the issue two ways in public bush takes 
the part of the loyal vice president saying he does not wish to 
prejudge meese a longtime associate of president reagans or to 
interfere with the legal process 
privately however his aides suggest that it would be better 
for the campaign if meese would go 
bush aides speaking on condition their names not be used say 
the vice president would be relieved if meese would resign but 
bush as one who has been steadfastly loyal to reagan has found it 
difficult to speak out on the issue they say 
the vice president was present at wednesdays meeting at the 
white house at which reagan met with two departing justice 
department officials who reportedly told the president that meese 
was hurting the justice department 
according to an administration source former justice department 
criminal division chief william weld outlined a hypothetical 
indictment he said he would have brought against meese if he had 
been the special prosecutor investigating the attorney general 
bush who was in the florida keys on friday for a weekend 
fishing trip with friends has not commented on the session 
a white house official who also insisted upon anonymity said 
that from bushs point of view nothing has changed as a result of 
the session 
another official said the meeting had been arranged by the white 
house and not because of bushs sensitivities to the problem it 
was first talked about when reagan was in california earlier this 
month the official said 
while making a point of not criticizing meese publicly bush 
often comes close telling audiences and interviewers that the 
justice department should be above reproach 
bush is proposing a new code of ethics that will help us avoid 
the excesses of the past and he speaks of plans to establish a 
highlevel ethics office in the white house 
people should come to washington to serve not to profit he 
told a republican gathering in lancaster pa earlier this week 
when a congressman goes bad or a member of the executive branch 
betrays the public trust you know and i know that it hurts 
since last may 11 meese has been the subject of a criminal 
investigation by a special prosecutor examining various issues 
including meeses assistance to scandalplagued wedtech corp 
looking ahead to the general election bush said recently that 
democrats are like a bunch of fish jumping out at a dry fly 
going wild about it theyre going to be going after me and ive 
already heard it on this socalled sleaze factor 
when asked if meese should resign bush usually says that he 
doesnt want to prejudge the attorney general and he goes on to 
stress the high ethical standards he says he has heeded throughout 
his political life

some faculty members and students at 
predominantly black south carolina state college are opposed to a 
decision to award an honorary degree to sen strom thurmond citing 
his civil rights record 
its not just his old past its his recent past every single 
civil rights bill since 1957 he has opposed right up to two weeks 
ago when he voted against the recent civil rights bill said 
history professor william hine 
the board of trustees decided in february to give the honorary 
doctorate of laws degree to thurmond during graduation may 8 
school president albert smith said 
four petitions are circulating among the faculty calling for the 
degree not to be awarded to the south carolina republican hine 
said and students are talking about boycotting graduation 
ceremonies 
thurmond will accept the award but will be out of the country 
may 8 on a classified trip with the senate armed services 
committee press secretary chris simpson said 
hine said most of the 25 faculty members he has talked with have 
agreed to sign the petitions 
smith said the petition drive wont stop the degree from being 
awarded 
certainly we need his support smith said 
simpson said thurmond has endowed a scholarship at the school 
and has helped bring 850000 in federal grants to the school 
within the past year 
he also noted that thurmond has been awarded honorary degrees at 
four other predominantly black schools claflin college allen 
university morris college and vorhees college 
if he had anything less then an exceptional record on aiding 
minorities or if there was anything to these allegations i feel 
certain that the other four historically black colleges would have 
reached the same conclusion he said

a federal judge has put the bite on the beef 
between dueling terlingua chili cookoffs saying the law offered no 
recipe for settling this longsimmering range war 
us district judge lucius bunton of pecod said he had no 
authority to determine which party would have the official worlds 
chili cookoff 
the parties should see this as an issue of good sense and 
decency and not look to the courts he said thursday 
however he settled one lesser issue in the suit filed by the 
faction headed by ray king of poteet ruling that the rival group 
founded by the late frank x tolbert had no right to call itself 
the chili appreciation society international inc 
jalapeno sam lewis a san angelo armadillorace promoter 
jalapeno lollipop seller and longtime supporter of the tolbert 
group said there will be no change in the cookoff format 
well still have two chili cookoffs in terlingua the first 
saturday in november well identify one as the tolbert cookoff and 
one as the king cookoff lewis said friday 
the terlingua cookoffs draw some 200 chili chefs to the 
mercurymining ghost town 300 miles southeast of el paso but they 
are not the biggest in the world the texas chili championship in 
san marcos draws 300 or 400 lewis said 
the terlingua cookoff lewis emphasized is the big cookoff 
you cook through the year at other competitions and receive 
points to get to terlingua 
tolbert the author of a bowl of red the bible of chili 
began the cookoff in 1967 by the early 1980s he was complaining 
that the cookoff had become too stuffy and structured so he bolted 
and formed the opposition group 
were more laid back lewis said we dont have a lot of 
rules or regulation they king group say you have to have chili a 
certain color red a certain type no beans that creates clone 
cooking 
jo ann horton of houston editor of the goat gap gazette the 
clarion of the chili world agreed with lewis 
one guy puts cracker jacks in his and wins they all put 
cracker jacks in theirs but she said most winners stick to the 
kiss recipe keep it simple stupid 
the two casi groups had their own recipe for rivalry beginning 
in 1983 both sides flew the casi inc banner at competing events 
on the same day both filed in 1983 for rights to the same name 
both ended up in buntons court 
bunton said king had registered the casi inc name as a federal 
trademark so the tolbert group had no right to use it he found 
that prior use of the trademark by tolbert did not constitute 
infringement but that future use by anyone other than the king 
group would 
he ordered casi inc to pay the tolbert heirs 1500 for the 
cost of the federal trademark but said the defendants must pay 
court costs no attorneys fees were awarded 
buntons ruling also waxed poetic on one issue the rivals hadnt 
raised hot chili 
some like it hot some like it cold some like it in the pot 
nine days old when it comes however to good stout chili if you 
dont like it hot youre just plum silly his ruling said

been involved he added i hope they have not acted with the 
support or authorization of any political party opposing the 
government

nicaragua accused the united states on friday 
of violating a monthold ceasefire agreement with rebel forces by 
sending food shipments to contra camps in honduras 
nicaraguas us ambassador carlos tunnermann was called back 
to managua for urgent consultations on the issue embassy 
political counselor martin vega said 
congress approved a 479 million humanitarian aid package for 
the rebels three weeks ago and 69000 pounds of rice beans and 
other food items were sent to contra camps in honduras near the 
nicaraguan border this week 
nicaragua contends that the temporary truce signed on march 23 
permits deliveries of humanitarian aid only to contras assembled in 
mutually agreed ceasefire zones inside nicaragua 
vega called the us deliveries a violation of the agreement he 
said tunnermann plans to return to washington on tuesday 
the leftist sandinista government and the rebels have designated 
seven ceasefire zones where the contras are to assemble but have 
not yet reached agreement on ground rules governing there presence 
in these areas 
thus the contras have not yet resettled in the zones even 
though an april 15 deadline had been set for their resettlement 
alfredo cesar a member of the directorate of the nicaraguan 
resistance the rebels formal name told reporters friday that 
large numbers of contras have fled across the border to honduras in 
recent weeks because of food shortages in nicaragua 
he denied that the shipments to contra camps represented a 
violation of the truce agreement 
the sandinista government maintains that the agreement specifies 
that the aid is to be delivered to rebels in the ceasefire zones 
by neutral organizations and that a verification commission 
must ensure compliance 
the secretary general of the organization of american states 
joao baena soares is one of two commission members he was due to 
interrupt a trip to latin america on friday night and to return to 
oas headquarters in washington to review the controversy over the 
us food shipments an oas spokesman said 
an agency for international development official speaking only 
on condition of anonymity said thursday the shipments were sent 
from the honduran capital of tegucigalpa after being inspected by 
independent observers including honduran clergymen 
these were the first deliveries of us aid to the rebels since 
congress cut off all assistance to the rebels on feb 29 the 479 
million package which includes food clothing shelter and medical 
supplies was approved by congress a week after the march 23 truce 
was signed 
cesar told reporters the number of rebels on the honduran side 
of the border has swelled in recent weeks to 3000 to 4000 because 
of the food shortages in nicaragua it was not clear however how 
many rebels were in that area prior to the recent exodus from 
nicaragua 
at the time of the truce agreement there were an estimated 
12000 contra fighters in nicaragua 
rebel forces in jungle and mountainous regions in nicaragua face 
a very difficult situation cesar said he added that the 
troops will be ordered to return to nicaragua once ussponsored 
food shipments inside nicaragua begin 
sandinista and rebel negotiators will resume their discussions 
on april 28 in managua cesar said he believes the differences 
between the two sides over ground rules in the ceasefire zones can 
be ironed out quickly

massachusetts gov michael dukakis on friday 
accused vice president george bush of failing to understand what 
it takes to build an economic future and to create good jobs 
dukakis attacking on what could be a major general election 
issue said i dont see how we are going to bring good jobs and 
good wages back to the industrial midwest unless we work together 
if the vice president doesnt understand that then he shouldnt be 
running for president 
the democratic frontrunner also criticized bush the 
allbutsure republican nominee for saying he wants to be the 
education president 
how can he say that after the last seven years dukakis 
asked a crowd of students at mercyhurst college after seven 
years of an administration that has slammed a door in the face of 
millions of youngsters looking for a chance to go to college after 
seven years of treating education as if it were a privilege for 
the few instead of a right and a necessity for every american 
as for his own proposals dukakis called for a national teaching 
excellence fund and an education security fund to boost teachers 
and to make more college loans available to students he said his 
ideas would cost an additional 250 million in federal spending 
the massachusetts governor had nothing but praise for his 
remaining democratic rival saying he and jesse jackson have to 
work together in the spirit of friendship for victory in the 
general election 
friday night he faced jackson in the first oneonone debate 
with the newly reduced field 
asked if jackson is less likely to be his running mate after a 
poll said such a move would cost the democrats votes in the fall 
dukakis said no i never pay any attention to polls 
dukakis had a full campaign day across ohio and pennsylvania 
seeking bluecollar votes in the nations industrial heartland the 
pennsylvania primary is next tuesday with ohio and indiana voting 
the next week 
youre looking at someone who is a trueblue 
dyedinthewool fullemployment democrat he told workers 
outside a ford plant in maumee ohio 
at the ford plant near toledo and a steel plant in pittsburgh 
dukakis emphasized his support for government working in 
partnership with business and labor to save jobs 
asked by a reporter about a bush statement that government 
should stay out of the private sector dukakis replied at a toledo 
airport news conference 
i dont think the vice president understands what it takes to 
build an economic future and to create good jobs there are 
governors and mayors businessmen and women labor leaders 
working together across this country 
government shouldnt do it all im a strong believer in the 
free enterprise system but we need a president who will be a 
strong partner for you here in ohio who will help with some 
resources some support he said its the publicprivate 
partnerships that are making the difference all over the country 
thats what ive been doing in massachusetts 
dukakis also criticized president reagan for threatening to veto 
the congressional trade bill because of its plantclosing 
provisions he took reagan to task for repeating his veto pledge 
thursday in springfield mass 
the irony is that he chose to deliver that speech in the one 
state that has a comprehensive plantclosing law that works and 
works well he told about 100 workers standing in a cold wind 
outside the ford plant 
later dukakis strengthened his criticism of reagan 
it would be a tragedy if the trade bill that has been worked 
on hard and that now is a responsible piece of legislation would be 
vetoed because of something we should have done a long time ago 
he told reporters in erie a very modest very mild 60day notice 
provision seems to me to be just simple justice for workers and 
working families

with lessons learned from the grenada 
evacuation charleston county officials are preparing for the 
possibility of a hasty civilian evacuation from central america 
i guess that the national network interviews of americans in 
panama made me think in terms of that basically its just 
headlines until you start seeing people and their concerns about 
things like that william j knowles director of charleston 
countys department of social services said friday 
during the past three weeks social services employees have been 
assembling survival boxes containing items ranging from 
registration forms to diapers 
they also have a stockpile of quarters for any new arrival who 
might need to make a telephone call 
the repatriation would be similar to the lastminute handling of 
the more than 500 evacuees flown to the charleston air force base 
after the 1983 invasion of grenada said knowles 
though the charleston air force base has not been designated a 
civilian evacuation landing zone knowles said it is the most 
logical and convenient for the large aircraft known to supply 
american bases in central america 
we were very lucky with grenada because this line of 
government dealt with that line of government right up to the state 
department but with something like an evacuation you never know 
what may happen he said 
its just been a prudent ground effort to muster the resources 
of an agency at a minutes notice he said we dont want to be 
in a position of having to run around looking for this and that

three federal research facilities were 
designated friday as special centers to help industry develop 
commercial uses for superconducting technology 
the argonne national laboratory in illinois los alamos national 
laboratory in new mexico and oak ridge national laboratory in 
tennessee will collaborate with private industry in an attempt to 
apply the technology gleaned from basic energy research energy 
secretary john s herrington said 
he said their designation is in keeping with an initiative 
president reagan outlined last year in which government and 
industry will work together to find commercial applications for 
hightemperature superconductors which can conduct electricity 
without energy loss 
superconductors have great potential in such areas as 
electrical generation storage and transmission computers 
communications medical diagnostics and transportation the 
energy department said however the newly discovered materials 
will require extensive research and development 
all three laboratories have been active in superconductivity 
research and have the facilities and expertise needed to make the 
technology marketable herrington said

a fire science specialist will examine the 
wreckage of a commuter plane that crashlanded at seattletacoma 
international airport with one of its two engines on fire federal 
investigators said friday 
merrit berke a government fire science expert will look at 
burn patterns on the de havilland dash 8 and try to help us 
determine where the fire originated said bob benzon of the 
national transportation safety board 
meanwhile the pilot of the horizon air plane issued a statement 
praising his crew and ground personnel in handling the april 15 
crash in which 19 of the 40 people on board were injured three 
remain hospitalized 
we did our jobs under the circumstances the crew of 
flight 2658 performed and handled the emergency the way we were 
trained pilot carl carlson who has declined public comment 
since the crash said thursday 
beyond those of us on the aircraft the emergency crews on the 
ground performed flawlessly he said 
the planes right engine burst into flames shortly after 
takeoff and carlson later told investigators he had trouble 
controlling the craft when he returned to the airport 
when the plane touched down the last words from carlson heard 
by the airport control tower were im out of control said 
steve boniberger an air traffic controller 
he said thursday that carlson sounded calm but became more 
excited while the plane touched down and hurtled down the runway 
controllers could see flames and smoke from the engine while the 
plane descended boniberger said 
he said the plane did not appear to be out of control in the 
air and that the pilot didnt mention the difficulty until landing 
benzon the ntsbs chief investigator on the crash said that 
despite the fire the plane could have been expected to remain on 
the runway during the landing instead it veered off the runway 
went across a strip of grass and crashed into passenger gates at 
the main terminal no one on the ground was injured 
investigators hope berke can help determine the source of the 
fuel leak involved in the fire and the source of ignition benzon 
said investigators believe the fuel may have spilled from a loose 
fuel pump he said 
the planes two engines were sent to the pratt amp whitney canada 
factory in montreal and other parts were sent to their 
manufacturers as part of the investigation

sell the stories of their crimes are held in escrow by the board

a federal judge friday refused to grant a 
mistrial in a smoking liability lawsuit saying he was satisfied 
that an opinion he issued that was critical of three tobacco 
companies had not prejudiced the jury 
defense attorneys for the cigarette makers requested the 
mistrial arguing that the opinion issued thursday by us district 
judge h lee sarokin had generated inflammatory headlines 
in the opinion sarokin dismissed some of the claims against the 
companies liggett group inc philip morris inc and lorillard 
inc but rejected the companies request to dismiss the entire 
lawsuit 
the judge said the jury will decide whether the companies 
covered up the dangers of smoking based on evidence that indicates 
a tobacco industry conspiracy vast in its scope devious in its 
purpose and devastating in its results 
the suit filed by antonio cipollone 64 of lakehurst says the 
cigarette makers bear responsibility for the death of cipollones 
wife rose who died at age 58 in 1984 after smoking for 40 years 
i know that jurors say they havent seen anything when they 
have peter bleakley an attorney for philip morris said in 
arguing for a mistrial i dont think anything can be done about 
the prejudice that has already taken place 
bleakley pointed to a headline in an area newspaper that said 
judge finds conspiracy 
sarokin questioned each juror individually in his chambers and 
emerged 45 minutes later and had the court clerk reread the 
questions he asked as well as each response of the jury 
in the remarks the judge told each juror that in the past two 
days there had been a great deal of publicity about the case and 
that he wanted to learn if they knew of it 
one man said all he ever reads is the comic strips and that the 
evening news is all malarkey the court clerk read 
five jurors said they had heard some outside comment on the case 
but had followed the judges instructions not to discuss it 
i am entirely satisfied that the answers of the jury are 
entirely credible sarokin told attorneys before recalling the 
jury there is no evidence whatsoever that the jurors were 
prejudiced it insults them to suggest that they would now lie to 
the court 
bleakley said that was never his contention 
i did not accuse any juror of lying bleakley said but 
there were highly inflammatory headlines and there should be a 
presumption that publicity was received 
in rejecting the defenses request thursday to dismiss the 
entire lawsuit sarokin wrote if the jury accepts the 
plaintiffs version of the facts as to the conduct of the 
defendants it is difficult to envision a more compelling case for 
an award of punitive damages 
sarokin did dismiss claims that the three companies caused mrs 
cipollones cancer by not marketing a safer cigarette and by 
failing to conduct adequate research into the health effects of 
smoking 
cipollones attorneys say the trial which began feb 1 breaks 
new ground because for the first time a plaintiffs lawyers had 
access to confidential files of tobacco companies and trade groups 
detailing their public relations strategies 
defense attorneys contend mrs cippolone smoked of her own free 
will and was an intelligent independent woman who knew the dangers 
smoking poses

american and soviet officials and journalists 
on friday closed an unusual conference on information policy with a 
recommendation that both governments ease travel restrictions on 
each others journalists 
the meeting resulted from a conversation at the washington 
summit last december involving kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev 
his politburo colleague aleksandr yakovlev and charles z wick 
head of the us information agency 
one discussion panel made a recommendation to urge our 
respective governments to take reciprocal steps to ease travel 
restrictions on journalists wick told a news conference 
wick and the head of the soviet delegation valentin falin 
chairman of the semiofficial novosti news agency stressed that 
the panels recommendation did not mean either government would 
change its policies 
in strict compliance with what has been said by the american 
side the soviet side on its return to moscow will report to the 
competent soviet agencies all the wishes that have been expressed 
and all the proposals and considerations that have been expressed 
during the meetings said falin 
the number and movements of us and soviet journalists in the 
respective countries are tightly controlled by the governments 
us journalists living in moscow and soviet journalists living in 
washington and new york cannot travel more than 21 miles outside 
those cities without prior approval from the host government 
the helsinki accords of 1975 eased some of restrictions on the 
work and movements of us and soviet journalists in each others 
countries but many remain 
for example some cities and regions in each country are closed 
to reporters and journalists from the other 
wick reading from a statement approved by one discussion panel 
said the group clearly felt that closed cities should be 
gradually opened and other restrictions on coverage should be 
lifted previous historical arguments about their origin should be 
abandoned 
soviet officials have said in the past that they imposed the 
restrictions in response to american actions 
us officials however say that the soviets imposed the travel 
restrictions after nazi germany invaded in 1941 and left them in 
place after the war the us government imposed similar 
restrictions on the movement of soviet journalists in the united 
states in the 1950s 
wick said the conference panel discussing the print media 
mutually agreed to undertake under the american society of 
newspaper editors the american society of magazine editors and 
equivalent soviet entities a survey of print media coverage to be 
performed by competent academic institutions selected by each side 
and reviewed by professional journalists 
the aim here is to address the innaccurate media stereotypes 
each society has of each other said wick 
there is recognition among panel members that access and 
coverage possibilities for journalists be maintained in the bad 
times as well as the good times perhaps even more so the 
statement said it was agreed that in times of tension accurate 
reporting provided by such access was all the more desirable

frank bourgin has been a civil servant a 
manufacturer and clothier in the 46 years since his doctoral 
dissertation was rejected by the university of chicago now hes 
finally going to get his phd and recognition for trailblazing 
scholarship 
there wasnt a time i didnt feel completely frustrated 
said bourgin now 77 and retired in chevy chase md i would meet 
a phd and think thats what i should be 
i would go to one of my stores in the morning and think what 
am i doing here opening a store he added in a recent interview 
with the new york times i spent 40 years doing things i really 
didnt want to do 
bourgin was a graduate student when he submitted his 
dissertation to the political science faculty at chicago in 1942 
he argued that the nations early leaders among them alexander 
hamilton and thomas jefferson had intended to use the federal 
governments powers to develop the fledgling nations resources 
through public works and other projects 
bourgins dissertation was rejected it may have sounded like 
heresy at the time 
the paper challenged the thencommon conviction that the new 
deal social programs of president franklin d roosevelt marked a 
departure from laissez faire principles attributed to the founding 
fathers 
bourgins idea has since gained wide acceptance through the work 
of other historians notably arthur schlesinger jr in his recent 
book cycles of american history 
bourgin decided after reading schlesingers book last year to 
make a new effort to gain acceptance for his dissertation now 
titled affirmative government in the early american economy 
he sent schlesinger a summary of his work setting in motion a 
process that will culminate later this spring when bourgin finally 
receives his doctorate at commencement 
were just not handing out a degree said professor joseph 
cropsey the political science departments director of graduate 
studies and a member of the threeman committee that reviewed the 
dissertation last fall 
he earned it 
i wasnt even born when he wrote this so i simply treated it 
as a revised draft gary orfield a political science professor 
at chicago and also a member of the review committee said friday 
but it had been updated there were many sources added that 
came long after the first paper was submitted orfield added 
its a testament to his grit he is the kind of guy everybody 
should want to be at his age determined committed pressing 
forward i think hes a real inspiration 
a letter from schlesinger who calls bourgins dissertation a 
strikingly original piece of work and prodding by several other 
scholars helped to bring about the review 
among bourgins supporters was c herman pritchett of the 
university of california a retired chairman of the political 
science department at chicago who is listed as a member of the 
original faculty review committee 
pritchett said he does not recall the original dissertation but 
after reading it recently at bourgins request he urged a 
reappraisal 
i thought it was a tremendous job pritchett said in a 
telephone interview with the times i simply couldnt understand 
how it could have been rejected 
though no one knows why the original dissertation was rejected 
it is believed the retirement of bourgins mentor and phd adviser 
played a role 
when bourgin learned of the rejection he was married had a 
child and a job and couldnt return to campus as a fulltime 
student to revise his manuscript 
bourgin went on to manufacture light fixtures owned a chain of 
mens clothing stores in minnesota and became a federal civil 
servant becoming regional director for the federal office of 
emergency planning supervising a fivestate region in the midwest 
now bourgins philosophical about his studys longawaited 
vindication 
its really a crazy story bourgin said

ipecac syrup and brite life iodides tincture an iodine are being 
recalled nationwide because of a labeling error the food and drug 
administration said friday 
some bottles of the iodine were mislabeled as ipecac syrup 
which is used to produce vomiting after a suspected poisoning 
iodine while potentially harmful if swallowed in large amounts 
would not likely to cause harm in such a small dose the fda said 
the problem stemming from the mislabeling is that iodine would not 
induce the desired vomiting said spokesman bill grigg 
the recall affects brite life ipecac syrup lot 004715 with 
expiration date 792 and brite life iodides tincture lot 004713 
with expiration date 292 
the fda said the mislabeled bottles of iodine may also be 
identified by the presence of a plastic applicator rod visible in 
the bottle 
the manufacturer humco laboratory of texarkana texas found 18 
mislabled iodine bottles inside its facilities and notified the fda 
and its distributors 
about 12000 bottles of the ipecac and 4500 bottles of iodine 
of the affected lots have been distributed since last september 
the fda said 
any bottles covered by the recall should be returned to the 
place of purchase the agency said

evangelist billy graham told listeners at 
chinas largest protestant seminary friday that he believes a 
christian revival is occurring in communistruled china 
he told about 250 students and faculty at the nanking union 
theological seminary that americans are going to church more and 
becoming more religious 
and among the christians in china i feel the same thing in 
just the short time ive been here that people are turning to 
christ in great numbers he said 
some people sat on wooden chairs in the aisles and others stood 
in the doorways of the packed chapel to hear the southern baptist 
minister 
graham said a highlevel government official told him that the 
church in china grows most when theres persecution 
the audience laughed when graham said the official whom he did 
not identify joked that maybe the best way to evangelize china 
is to have much persecution 
christianity has never had a strong following in china despite 
centuries of missionary work by western countries before the 
communist takeover in 1949 
during the 196676 cultural revolution christians were 
persecuted churches were turned over to secular groups or 
destroyed and many believers were tortured and jailed 
in recent years the government has allowed religious activities 
to resume but it administers all such activity through the bureau 
of religious affairs 
an estimated 4 million protestants worship in 4000 
statesanctioned churches but millions more are believed to meet 
privately in their homes 
an estimated 3 million catholics belong to the 
governmentsupervised catholic churches patriotic association 
which does not recognize the authority of the roman catholic pope 
millions of other catholics are believed to remain loyal to the 
vatican and worship in secret 
the government has no relations with the vatican which 
recognizes the rival nationalist chinese government on taiwan 
graham spoke for about an hour at the seminary which has 170 
students lecturing on how to preach effectively 
the 69yearold evangelist who has preached in 70 countries 
told his listeners to preach the gospel with authority simplicity 
repetition and urgency 
during a questionandanswer period a student asked how to 
preach christianity in an officially athiestic country such as 
china 
in the same way graham replied 
im not sure there are genuine athiests he added 
the nanking seminary is the only one in china that accepts 
students from all over the country ten smaller protestant 
seminaries accept only students from their areas and have a total 
of enrollment of about 600 
graham accompanied by his wife ruth and son franklin 
traveled to shanghai later friday 
graham is making his first visit to china he arrived april 12 
and spent a week in beijing where he met with premier li peng 
the grahams also visited huaiyin in eastern jiangsu province 
where mrs graham the daughter of a mission doctor spent the 
first 17 years of her life 
graham is scheduled to visit canton before leaving china on 
april 28

president reagan on friday charged congress 
with caving in to organized labor with its trade bill but 
supporters of the measure said it was his wishful thinking that 
a veto would win him a version he prefers 
the president has promised to veto the bill because of a 
provision requiring all but the smallest employers to give 60 days 
notice of plant closings and largescale layoffs 
as the senate began debate on the sweeping trade measure friday 
reagan told a group of conservative state legislators that the 
plantclosings provision would make american industry less 
competitive 
put simply on key provisions in the trade bill the 
democratic leadership in congress has caved in to pressure from 
organized labor reagan said if this bill is unloaded on my 
desk ill stamp it reject and ship it back to where it was made 
the house on thursday passed the bill with democrats achieving 
more than the twothirds vote needed to override a reagan veto 
the white house continued lobbying senators on friday to vote 
with the president arguing it would force congress to send him a 
bill without the plantclosing provision 
thats wishful thinking senate majority leader robert c 
byrd dwva said as senate debate began friday if enough 
senators voted to sustain the veto we would be taking a severe 
chance in not having this legislation become law he said and 
i would argue that we not gamble 
byrd said a senate vote on the 1000page bill was expected on 
tuesday and although confident it would pass he was not sure he 
could muster the twothirds majority needed to override a veto the 
house vote on the legislation was 312107 
if the presidents veto were sustained byrd said the trade bill 
a product of years of work and a housesenate compromise on 
competing bills that passed last year would have to start from 
scratch in the process 
this matter is not going to be turned around that easily and 
that quickly byrd said noting there were 170 amendments the 
last time it was before the senate 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas 
emphasized the broad scope of the measure which was being obscured 
by the very specific veto fight 
among its hundreds of provisions the bill gives new powers to 
the us trade representative repeals the windfall profits tax on 
oil and relaxes controls on us exports of high technology 
equipment 
we havent had a trade policy since world war ii 
bentsen said although the nation did well without one when it was 
the dominant world economic power that time has since changed 
and now were in tough competition he said 
sen john danforth rmo said he like many republicans 
wanted to support their president but he would vote to override 
i hope that when senators vote on this bill they have their 
eyes open to the consequences he said of the hot electionyear 
issue it is by no means certain that this bill can be saved in 
some other form 
the leaders of japan at which much of the trade bill was aimed 
made clear friday they would welcome its demise 
chief cabinet secretary keizo obuchi in a nationally televised 
news conference said relations with the united states would suffer 
but said he had strong expectations the legislation would die 
hajime tamura minister for international trade and industry 
said he deeply regretted house passage of the bill 
while i do not think it will be passed in the senate in the 
end i will urge the us administration to block the bill and 
await the common sense of the american people tamura said 
the bill includes two provisions regarded as threatening to 
japanese business 
one is the provision giving the trade representative power to 
decide what constitutes unfair trade practices by another country 
and what to do about it another imposes sanctions against toshiba 
corp and its subsidiary toshiba machine co which sold 
submarinesilencing equipment to the soviet union in violation of a 
western trade agreement on sensitive technology exports

an inmate who claims he inherited 25 million 
may not have to wait for freedom to start spending it state 
officials said friday because if he really has the money they want 
him to fork over room and board 
it seems only fair for inmates who have the resources to 
repay their debt to society while theyre paying their debt to 
society said department of corrections spokesman brian fairchild 
were going to go after the money if its there 
tony fieldman convicted of robbing a chicago cab driver of 60 
at knifepoint on dec 27 1986 told authorities at joliet 
correctional center his mother died and left him the money 
officials said 
but were not sure that he has in fact inherited 25 
million fairchild said he has supplied nothing to us other 
than a death certificate for his mother which is a year old 
if fieldmans claim is true corrections officials plan to seek 
a court order to make him pay for the estimated 16000ayear cost 
of housing fairchild said 
fieldman who began serving an eightyear sentence march 25 
could be eligible for early release for good behavior in four 
years fairchild said 
he would run up a tab of about 64000 for a fouryear stay 
about the amount he would receive in interest on the inheritance in 
that period the spokesman said 
fieldman 36 of chicago apparently fears greedy inmates who 
got word of the purported windfall and was moved to protective 
custody earlier this week at his own request fairchild said 
the corrections department has launched an investigation to 
determine if the woman named in the death cerificate who died in 
las vegas nev was in fact fieldmans mother and to see if she 
did leave him the money fairchild said 
he declined to release the womans name or any additional 
information about her 
recovering costs from inmates is not something that weve 
routinely done in the past because usually inmates dont have those 
kind of assets fairchild said 
but requiring fieldman to pay for room and board would not be 
unprecedented he said 
state law authorizes the corrections department to seek legal 
action to attach inmates assets for the purpose of reimbursing 
the state for costs of incarceration he said 
workrelease inmates housed at community correctional centers 
must pay for room and board fairchild said 
about 20 percent of their takehome pay is deposited in an 
account that helps pay for their incarceration he said adding 
last year that raised almost half a million dollars for the 
department 
attorney john jackson with the us bureau of prisons said he 
had never heard of costs being recovered from federal inmates 
inmate costs are covered by the federal budget and as far as i 
know the government has always paid all of it he said from 
washington dc

a committee settled a feud friday between 
two groups competing to take the dramatic story of toddler jessica 
mcclures rescue from an abandoned well to television 
the choice of a los angelesbased firm satisfied the two groups 
of rescuers civic leaders and jessicas parents ending nearly two 
months of dissension that had split this west texas city officials 
said 
the two contending groups were municipal workers who 
participated in the rescue and a group of volunteers 
a fivemember panel mayor carroll thomas appointed to settle the 
spat chose a television movie proposal from los angelesbased 
interscope communications inc over one from producer larry spivey 
president of highland communications group inc 
the selection of interscope and word from the mcclures attorney 
that negotiations will begin between the family and the film 
company appeared to halt the monthslong battle for movie rights to 
jessicas story 
the jessica mcclure rescue story is the type of story which 
should be told because it exemplifies the noblest aspects of the 
human spirit said committee chairman wayne merritt a midland 
banker 
jessica was 18 months old when she fell into the well in a 
neighbors yard oct 14 rescuers many of them oilfield workers 
dug a shaft through solid rock to save the toddler in a televised 
58hour effort that drew international attention 
proposals from interscope and spivey were among dozens of 
proposals initially pitched to the mcclures and workers involved in 
the rescue the flood of offers prompted the formation of two 
rescuers groups after disagreements arose over rights negotiations 
thomas appointed the committee after both groups agreed to abide 
by the decision of the panel the effort that was made to 
reconcile was as as great as the rescue effort in october said 
merritt 
one group remains committed to a deal with spivey but spokesman 
bob hawk said his group endorsed the committees decision and will 
talk to spivey next week that group consists of more than 30 
volunteers 
another group consisting mainly of municipal employees 
announced friday it had disbanded because its purpose finding a 
producer had been served 
it is hoped that the disbandment will permit the successful 
producer to deal individually with all the people in midland which 
the producer deems necessary to portray an accurate and 
allencompassing truelife story of jessicas rescue said police 
cpl jim white 
details remain to be worked out said committee members 
the interscope proposal listed john kander ii as coexecutive 
producer with dick berg who will write the script interscope has 
produced such television movies as murder ordained for cbs and 
such feature films as three men and a baby outrageous 
fortune and revenge of the nerds 
interscope called the story an important and positive 
reflection not only of the strength of the human spirit even that 
of a small child but of the strength of a community when it is 
banded together at the heart 
the movie will be sponsored by campbell soup co and will be 
shown on abc officials said

sen daniel p moynihan dny on friday 
asked for a full report on the governments decision to sign a 
50 million lease on a building here for justice department offices 
in may 1987 
the building was owned by a partnership that included members of 
the bender family which indirectly pays the salary of attorney 
general edwin meeses wife ursula 
as chairman of the senate subcommittee with oversight of these 
aspects of gsa the general services administration i am asking 
gsa to provide a full report to this committee on this matter 
moynihan said in a statement 
the gsa the governments housekeeping agency signed the lease 
on the building 
moynihan said his interest in the chester arthur building in 
downtown washington was piqued by recent news reports that the 
bender partnership sold the building for a 60 percent profit about 
two weeks after signing the lease the partnership made a profit of 
226 million over two years 
the bender foundation the familys taxexempt philanthropy 
contributes the money that goes for mrs meeses 40000ayear 
salary at the multiple sclerosis society 
meese says he had nothing to do with the lease and that there 
is no connection between his wifes job and the buildings lease 
gsa officials have said there was nothing unusual about the 
lease but moynihan said news reports concerning the building 
where the immigration and naturalization service has offices 
raised questions about gsas actions 
dale bruce a gsa spokesman said he had not seen moynihans 
letter but the agency would comply with any requests from congress 
although the house public works and transportation committee 
regularly approves prospective leases the parallel senate panel 
has declined to follow that procedure since the late 1970s 
according to sen robert stafford rvt

the interior department told congress that 
irrigation subsidies in the west had been only about a quarter to 
half what its own experts and white house budget officers believed 
was correct according to documents released by a house 
subcommittee chairman friday 
the chairman rep sam gejdenson dconn said the documents 
indicate the department went to extraordinary lengths to lower 
the bureau of reclamation subsidy estimate and used a subsidy 
calculation it knew was inconsistent with the method in president 
reagans fiscal year 1989 budget 
in february the department told rep george miller dcalif 
that all past subsidies for the bureaus irrigation projects in the 
west amounted to 98 billion in todays dollars it said the 
subsidies currently were about 543 million a year of which an 
estimated 203 million went to irrigate surplus crops receiving 
other aid in agriculture department programs 
gejdensons documents indicated that bureau and department 
experts wanted to use figures of 19 billion to 24 billion for the 
total historical subsidy 22 billion for the annual subsidy and 
830 million for the subsidy for surplus crops 
miller is chairman of the water and power subcommittee of the 
house interior committee and gejdenson is chairman of the oversight 
and investigations subcommittee 
i find it incredible that an administration that professes to 
support cutting farm subsidies and the federal deficit would go to 
such extraordinary lengths to minimize its estimate of the subsidy 
received by a select group of western farmers gejdenson wrote 
interior secretary donald p hodel 
he asked that hodel supply new answers to millers questions 
using calculations specified by the office of management and budget 
answers he already has in the documents which included drafts of 
the feb 24 reply to miller from wayne marchant principal deputy 
assistant secretary for water and science that incorporated the 
omb estimates 
marchant said friday he did not know how he would reply to 
gejdenson but i am confident we are correct and this is an 
intellectually defensible analysis 
congress provides many subsidies to irrigation projects the 
most important of which are interestfree repayment of construction 
loans from the treasury or belowmarket interest rates over the 
decades politicians from the west of all parties have jealously 
protected those subsidies 
the difference in the subsidy estimates arises largely from 
disputes over what interest rates to use 
the department used published historical longterm treasury 
borrowing rates for 19061957 and after that a statutory small 
projects formula rate designed to reflect longterm treasury 
borrowing costs the departments experts argued that the formula 
blended historical and current rates in such a way that the real 
subsidy was underestimated 
marchant said in an interview that his boss assistant secretary 
james ziegler is an investment banker and knows whereof he 
speaks 
ziegler marchant said argued successfully with omb that many 
irrigation districts were the equivalent of municipal governments 
with their own taxing power and could have qualified to borrow at 
a taxfree rate which would have been even lower than the 
federal rate 
not all the difference in subsidy estimates was the result of 
differing interest rates marchant said some 45 billion 
represents federal investment not yet repaid thats crazy to 
include it he maintained since it will be repaid

in case there is no solution to the cambodian problem through 
this plan by 1990 then we vietnam will solve the problem 
unilaterally and we will withdraw our troops unilaterally tran 
said 
vietnam maintains about 140000 troops in cambodia 
tran said the first move under the proposal would be holding 
informal talks as proposed earlier by indonesia and backed in 
principle by vietnam and the association of southeast asian 
nations comprised of indonesia malaysia thailand singapore the 
philippines and brunei 
he said these discussions would be in two stages 
first would be talks among the hun sen regime in phnom penh 
which was installed by vietnam after it invaded cambodia in late 
1978 and the three factions of the coalition government of 
democratic kampuchea cambodia coalition guerrillas are fighting 
hun sen and the vietnamese from inside cambodia near the thai 
border 
vietnam like neighboring cambodia is communist but the 
government vietnam installed there is provietnam and prosoviet 
while the ousted regime was prochina 
the threeparty coalition is headed by prince norodom sihanouk 
former head of state of cambodia and is made up of sihanouk 
loyalists the propeking khmer rouge which killed millions of 
cambodians before being ousted by vietnam and the cambodian 
national liberation front of son sann khieu samphan now leads the 
khmer rouge 
it is up to these cambodians to work out what sort of peace 
they want but it should not be something which will see a 
resurgence of a genocidal regime tran said 
he added it should be a peaceful independent neutral and 
nonaligned cambodia 
the second stage would be for the cambodians and concerned 
countries like vietnam and indonesia to join in further informal 
discussions tran said 
these two stages of talks could be held in jakarta indonesia 
since that country also has offered to act as host said tran 
he said the third stage would be a formal international 
conference to work out such issues as guaranteeing peace in 
cambodia and supervising a transitional phase 
the vietnamese official said this conference could be held in 
india 
he noted that sihanouk hun sen vietnamese foreign minister 
nguyen ho thach and others have said india could play a role in 
helping bring peace to cambodia he said india might also assist in 
supervising the accord 
tran arrived in malaysia from indonesia on monday and spoke at 
the news conference before leaving for thailand en route to the 
philippines

us officials said friday they had no 
confirmation that the hijackers of the kuwaiti airlines jet had 
left algeria despite published reports they had flown to syria or 
lebanon 
there are conflicting reports about the whereabouts of the 
hijackers but we have no indication they have left algeria the 
question of where they are should be addressed to the government of 
algeria state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley told 
reporters she declined to elaborate 
on thursday mrs oakley said we dont know where the 
hijackers are but an administration source said that on the 
basis of new information the department had modified its position 
something came in that made us able to say that said the 
source speaking on condition that he not be further identified 
but the source declined to specify the nature of the 
information and said we cannot say with certainty that they are 
still in algeria 
mrs oakley has said us officials were discussing whereabouts 
of the hijackers with algerian authorities 
a sovietbuilt antonov transport of the algerian air force was 
seen taking off from the algiers airport before dawn wednesday 
shortly before the hostages left the hijacked plane it was widely 
assumed the hijackers were aboard 
western diplomats have said the hijackers went to beirut but 
officials at beirut airport denied they landed there 
the new york times in friday editions quoted unidentified arab 
officials as saying the hijackers were flown on a private algerian 
jet to damascus syria and were believed to have traveled overland 
from there to lebanon 
but there was no independent confirmation that they were in 
lebanon 
kuwait and other arab nations lauded algeria for winning freedom 
for the hostages without additional violence but the united 
states britain and other western powers criticized algeria for 
allowing the hijackers to get away

the publication friday of a highly critical 
congressional report on a federal agency created to manage and sell 
property from insolvent savings institutions was followed by an 
announcement that the agencys chairman had resigned last month 
the report by the staff of the house banking committee charged 
that the federal asset disposition association has become a 
bloated bureacracy that wastes millions of dollars of public 
money 
committee chairman fernand g st germain dri in an written 
statement accompanying the report said fada should be phased out 
as soon as possible and its duties reassumed by the federal savings 
and loan insurance corp which backs deposits in federally insured 
sampls 
the house report was dated march 17 but it was not made public 
until friday when it was published in the congressional record 
in a letter dated march 31 but not released by fada until 
friday the agencys chairman william f mckenna submitted his 
resignation effective immediately 
mckenna a los angeles attorney wrote that his resignation is 
intended to open the way for the federal home loan bank board 
which regulates 3147 federal thrift institutions to pick his 
replacement and achieve maximum capability with fadas new 
executive command and chartered course 
he has been replaced on an acting basis by vice chairman john 
b zellars chairman of georgia federal bank in atlanta 
mckenna was previously chairman of the federal savings and loan 
advisory council an industry group that advises federal 
regulators his law firm represents some of the largest sampls in the 
industry and the creation of fada was his idea 
the stated purpose of fada is bring money into the sampl insurance 
fund at a time when it is short of funds to resolve the problems 
of soaring insolvencies particularly in texas and other states 
hard hit by depressed oil prices 
however the house report said the unspoken agenda was to give 
the savings and loan industry more specifically a small but very 
powerful subgroup of the industry a major say in how the thrift 
industrys problems would be resolved 
the report said it was difficult to determine how much money 
fada has wasted but it said has directly charged 20 million to 
receiverships set up to liquidate failed sampls and it has passed on 
51 million in subcontractor costs despite this income fada is 
more than 15 million in the red the report said 
money spent by the receiverships is deducted from what is 
eventually left for the creditors of failed institutions including 
depositors over the insurance limit of 100000 
gerald carmen who took over as fada chief executive in 
february said he is working to remedy the agencys faults 
we know there have been problems with fada and thats why they 
brought me aboard he said i have not read the report but 
when i do read it problems that are real and exist were going to 
fix 
carmen said he hoped within six months to resolve longrange 
and strategic questions such as whether fada should be merged 
with the insurance fund be completely privatized or continue under 
its present structure 
he said he has reduced the fada payroll from 388 to 370 
employees saving 1 million a year and is consolidating fada 
office space for a reduction of 16000 square feet he predicted 
fada would be in the black for the first quarter of the year 
i think were starting to bring it under control carmen 
said 
however the house report described reform efforts so far as 
cosmetic and as public relations intended to defuse 
criticism 
among the other findings of the house report 
fada employees awarded contracts without bidding to former 
business associates 
fada officials lived first class and received excessive 
salaries and bonuses it said its top 32 executives were paid 
over 3 million in 1987 and its total payroll of 22 million went 
to more 380 employees 
from its creation in late 1985 to the end of last year it 
managed to sell only 124 million of the property in its care 
certain fada employees continue to maintain financial 
interests in firms that could benefit from fada contracts 
william fulwider a spokesman for the bank board said the 
information in the house report is dated he said fada is reducing 
its expenses and is cooperating more fully with fslic 
mark clark a vice president of the us league of savings 
institutions the largest trade group in the industry said league 
officials would have no immediate comment

thailand which has been criticized for 
rejecting boat people will expand a refugee center in order to 
accommodate up to 10000 arrivals officials said friday 
but to prevent a flood of escapees from vietnam those housed at 
the center will not be eligible for resettlement in third 
countries the officials said 
the door has been somewhat opened said one official 
speaking on condition of anonymity however he said thailands 
recent policy of turning back vietnamese boat people could be 
reinstated and that in some cases it was still being carried out 
thailand was criticized by some international aid agencies and 
the us government for pushing vietnamese boats back out to sea 
some reports have claimed that 100 to 170 refugees may have drowned 
after their boats were turned away from thailand early this year 
thai officials speaking at a background briefing said thailand 
adopted tough measures because western governments were not living 
up to their agreement to accept the refugees 
they also said there was no end in sight to the flow of 
immigrants and the new arrivals were economic migrants rather 
than people fleeing persecution 
the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
tough stance had been modified because of hopeful signs 
including a greater movement of refugees from thailand to the 
united states and a growing realization by the international 
community that indochinese refugees had to be resettled 
they indicated that thailand was also unhappy about the adverse 
publicty surrounding the rejection of the boat people 
the officials said an annex was being constructed at site 2 a 
camp along the border with cambodia to house 8000 to 10000 
vietnamese the camp to be administered by the thai military 
already holds more than 900 vietnamese boat people and 4000 who 
fled vietnam by land and crossed cambodia 
about 2600 vietnamese now along the thai coast will be moved to 
the site 2 annex 
another 15000 vietnamese are being housed at phanat nikhom a 
transit center for indochinese refugees including cambodians and 
laotians 
this center is to be closed to new vietnamese arrivals and 
pressure will be exerted on the united states and other countries 
to accept those currently there the officials said 
thirteen years after the vietnam war we have gone beyond a 
certain threshold one official said those now coming are not 
the traditional boat people most are looking for better economic 
opportunities 
the thai government ordered the vietnamese boats turned away 
when the numbers of refugees jumped dramatically at the end of last 
year and rose to 2500 in january 1988 alone 
many arrived via cambodia with the aid of smugglers 
the officials said reports of deaths had been exaggerated they 
said less than 100 vietnamese perished and fewer than 20 bodies had 
been recovered in thai waters 
it was never the willful or malicious intent of the royal thai 
government to cause harm or injury to vietnamese asylumseekers 
the background paper said 
thailand has since 1975 provided temporary refuge for over 1 
million indochinese refugees 
the vietnamese are regarded as illegal immigrants but a large 
number have in the past been allowed by local authorities to land 
without problems 
the officials indicated the law would remain ambiguous although 
there had been a recent softening of thai attitude the 
background paper said those who would not be allowed to land on 
thai shores would be given food water and fuel and their boats 
would be repaired if necessary 
a major influx could unravel these new arrangements one 
official said he noted that since january the number of arrivals 
had dropped dramatically but he did not provide a number

outraged florida state university 
officials suspended pi kappa alpha fraternity friday after a grand 
jury said an intoxicated 18yearold woman student was raped at 
the fraternity house and the groups members refused to cooperate 
with the investigation 
the young woman was found march 5 with crude words and a 
fraternity symbol written on her thigh a leon county grand jury 
said thursday in an interim report 
she had been raped by more than one person her clothing was in 
disarray she had suffered multiple scratches and abrasions and 
she was so drunk that her life was in danger the report said 
we informed pi kappa alpha they are suspended immediately 
pending a formal hearing which will begin next wednesday dean of 
students james hayes said friday they are no longer a registered 
student organization at fsu they lose all rights and privileges 
the incident marked the second time in a week the fraternity was 
suspended on a florida campus the pi kappa alpha chapter at 
stetson university in deland was suspended april 15 in the wake of 
reports of a similar incident 
stetson dean of student affairs garth jenkins has said a young 
woman reported she was sexually assaulted by more than one man 
during a fraternity party april 9 he also said he heard reports 
that other people watched the alleged assault 
the executive vice president of the memphis tennbased 
national fraternity ray orians said there were roughly 130 
fraternity members at florida state and 70 at stetson 
investigators for the national organization visted both campuses 
this week he said 
were looking at this florida state incident at this point 
as an individual incident involving an individual member that had 
nothing to do with the chapter he said 
in the stetson case we do know there was some violations of 
school rules separate and apart from any sexual allegations 
said orians stetson is a baptist university 
hayes said florida state officials were sickened over police 
information and the grand jurys interim report on the incident 
there no individuals have been charged but the investigation was 
continuing 
when you have 25000 students you have disciplinary problems 
but a situation like this hasnt happened in my nine years here 
said hayes 
the president of the fraternity brant byrd of bellair told the 
florida flambeau a student newspaper that he was advised not to 
talk in public about the incident 
my comment is that im very involved with final exams and exam 
week and my attorney told me not to concentrate on the grand jury 
but to concentrate on final exams the flambeau reported friday 
the panels report criticized the fraternity for not cooperating 
and urged witnesses to step forward 
possible witnesses have a civic and moral duty to come forward 
and report what they have seen or what they have heard from or 
about the perpetrators of this sordid incident the grand jury 
stated 
the 18yearold florida state university student was found raped 
and intoxicated to a lifethreatening degree early on march 5 
the grand jury said 
the victim was found on the floor of the theta chi fraternity 
house about a block from the pi kappa alpha house at about 530 
am and taken to a hospital for treatment and an examination 
the grand jury said members of theta chi and of sigma chi 
fraternity where the victim said she had visited earlier were 
cooperative campus police determined members of those two 
organizations were not involved and knew nothing about the victim 
or the crime 
by contrast pi kappa alpha fraternity members were 
uncooperative and evasive the grand jury said 
the victim told authorities she had met a pi kappa alpha member 
at a club where she had been drinking beer and tequila she said 
he took her to his fraternity house giving her a bottle of wine 
which she consumed 
she alleges her host then sexually assaulted her and she 
passed out from intoxication wrote the grand jury 
a medical examination revealed that the victim had a 0349 
bloodalcohol level more than three times the legal limit for 
driving and had been raped by more than one person according to 
the grand jury report 
she was comatose said police lt jack handley adding that 
sexual intercourse had occurred during the time she was 
unconscious she was in a lifethreatening situation 
handley declined to give details on the words or the symbol 
written on the womans thigh except to say it was a fraternity 
symbol but not the symbol of the pi kappa alpha fraternity 
the woman was released from the hospital march 6 hayes said she 
has been receiving counseling the drinking age in florida is 21 
meanwhile fraternity and sorority pledging was suspended on the 
state university of new york at albany on friday after a student 
was electrocuted when he waded into a pond during an apparent 
fraternity stunt 
bryan higgins 20 a sophomore from mahopac ny died after he 
walked into the pond wearing only his underwear around 615 pm 
thursday 
albany county district attorney sol greenburg said the death 
appeared accidental and the incident appeared to be a nonviolent 
hazing two other students were injured by the electric current in 
the concretelined pond 
the reason the pond had current running through it was not 
immediately determined the current disappeared when switches to 
electrical circuits near the pond were turned off thursday night

president daniel ortega asked the 
reagan administration friday to resume negotiations next month on 
national security matters of mutual concern 
he suggested the meetings begin may 15 at manzanillo on mexicos 
west coast site of several rounds in 1984 the united states 
suspended the negotiations in january 1985 
ortega also claimed the us decision to give nonlethal aid to 
nicaraguan rebels in honduras violated agreements between the 
rebels known as contras and his leftist sandinista government he 
said the move encouraged military hardliners in the contra 
leadership 
at a news conference in managua he accused the united states of 
concealing weapons and ammunition in shipments of humanitarian aid 
to rebels in honduran camps 
on the matter of usnicaraguan negotiations ortega said it 
was time president reagan fulfilled a promise of talks he made last 
year 
reagan told the organization of american states in november that 
secretary of state george p shultz was prepared to meet the 
sandinistas as part of discussions with other central american 
countries once serious negotiations on a nicaraguan ceasefire 
were under way 
we have met with the contras there is a ceasefire there is 
an agreement and the time has come for the us government to show 
consistency by meeting with nicaragua to discuss matters of 
national security ortega said 
he said the nicaraguan proposal for talks would be delivered by 
carlos tunnerman ambassador to washington who was called home 
thursday for consultations tunnerman and foreign minister miguel 
descoto attended the news conference 
we are offering to discuss topics of security ortega said 
the us government has singled out nicaragua as a security 
threat and we are willing to discuss that and we also want to be 
heard about how nicaragua has lived under a state of aggression by 
the united states 
he urged washington to lift its economic embargo on nicaragua 
declaring favorable conditions exist for reagan and congress to 
act constructively but the us governments attitude 
continues to be negative 
ortega said he discussed us humanitarian aid to contras in 
honduras with that countrys president jose azcona hoyo who said 
he was informed by the united states that the rebels were dying 
of hunger 
an agreement between the contra leadership and nicaraguan 
government allows humanitarian aid to be distributed through 
neutral international organizations when the rebels are settled in 
designated ceasefire zones in nicaragua 
the nicaraguan leader said he told azcona the contras in 
honduras should be considered refugees disarmed and relocated 
away from the nicaraguan border or enter nicaragua and join 
other rebels in the areas assigned 
an agreement between the nicaraguan government and contra 
leaders provides for rebels to assemble in seven designated areas 
during the first two weeks of may 
ortega said nonlethal aid most of it food was being flown 
from toncontin airport in tegucigalpa the honduran capital to 
camps controlled by contra commanders who oppose the ceasefire 
he said he told azcona the advisable thing would be to tell 
aid the us agency for international development to wait until 
the negotiations between the nicaraguan resistance contras and 
the government agree on the way the rebels enter the assigned areas 
or become refugees in honduras 
an aid official said thursday the first truckloads of food 
arrived at rebel camps inside honduras this week he said the 
shipments were sent from tegucigalpa after being inspected by 
independent observers to make sure they did not contain arms 
contra and government leaders signed an agreement march 23 to 
end the civil war which the government says has cost more than 
26000 lives since 1981 a 60day ceasefire began april 1

us and pakistani officials said they would 
welcome an end to soviet arms shipments to the kremlinbacked 
regime in afghanistan but reacted cautiously to statements along 
that line by a senior aide to mikhail s gorbachev 
state department spokesman phyllis oakley said that the united 
states will continue to supply the resistance as long as the 
soviet union continues supplying arms to the kabul regime 
we have also made clear that we would prefer a complete 
cessation of military aid by both the united states and the 
soviet union who are acting as guarantors of an agreement signed 
in geneva on the withdrawal of an estimated 120000 soviet troops 
form afghanistan she said 
yevgeny primakov who has advised gorbachev on the afghan war 
was quoted in the washington post on friday as saying the soviet 
union was not planning to continue shipping arms to the kabul 
regime 
we dont need to supply said primakov we arent going to 
supply if the americans arent going to supply but we arent going 
to restrict our relations with the afghan government headed by 
the kremlin ally najibullah 
primakovs remarks appeared to break sharply with a position the 
soviets have held since january the kremlin refused an american 
proposal to end aid simultaneously a formula known in diplomatic 
jargon as negative symmetry and insisted instead continuing aid 
described as positive symmetry 
moreover western diplomats in islamabad said tuesday that 
soviet aircraft were flying night missions into kabul shipping 
tons of arms from the soviet union 
asked to assess primakovs remarks mrs oakley said it is not 
clear what time frame he is addressing if mr primakov is 
indicating an authoritative soviet position on restraint during 
withdrawal which we have proposed we welcome it 
the united states has accelerated the flow of aid to the 
mujahedeen guerrillas across the pakistani border and the soviet 
union has stepped up its shipments of arms to the najibullah 
regime according to american officials 
primakov made his remarks to a group of americans visiting 
kabul a trip that pakistani and us officials said appeared 
designed to give respectability to the najibullah regime 
one pakistani diplomat said primakovs remarks might be designed 
to put pressure on pakistan to stop us arms from moving through 
its territory 
we have to take primakovs statement carefully said the 
pakistani diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity officials 
of the afghan regime are trying to gain some respectability with 
this group of influential americans said the official 
a state department source said that primakovs comments appeared 
to be part of a campaign to pressure paskistan but predicted it 
would not work 
i think that the soviets will be making statements like this 
from time to time said the source who spoke on condition that 
he not be further identified 
if the intent is to pressure pakistan then i dont think it 
will achieve that result i think it will stiffen the pakistani 
resolve said the source

countrys parliament requiring the government to tell visiting 
ships that nuclear arms are barred from danish ports in peacetime 
britain refuses to say whether its ships carry nuclear arms 
a brief british foreign office announcement said that in view 
of the danish general election the british and danish governments 
have agreed it would be appropriate to postpone a number of british 
navy visits which had been scheduled in the coming week 
it was the first such boycott by a member of the nato alliance 
british sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
policy of refusing to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear 
weapons is an absolute matter of principle there is no 
exception 
danish prime minister poul schlueter whose centerright 
coalition is opposed to the nuclear weapons resolution called a 
new election rather than impose the measure 
denmark like nato member norway has for 30 years officially 
banned nuclear weapons from its ports in peacetime but both 
countries avoided controversy over the issue by not asking whether 
visiting ships carried nuclear weapons 
the new danish resolution underlined the dilemma posed by a nato 
member opposed to nuclear weapons which are considered fundamental 
to the defense strategy of the 16nation alliance 
britain the united states and other several other nato 
countries have stopped naval visits to new zealand a nonnato 
member which bans nuclear weapons on its territory 
danish newspapers reported friday that west germany sent a 
strong letter to foreign minister uff ellemannjensen protesting 
the resolution 
west germany is denmarks closest nato ally the two nations 
share a concern over the defense of the baltic sea and its narrow 
approaches which are under danish control 
the us government and nato secretarygeneral lord carrington 
also have publicly criticized the resolution 
the british decision meant canceling visits by six ships 
including a destroyer hms bristol and a frigate hms euryalus 
officials said the other ships involved are three minesweepers and 
a survey vessel

president reagan assured a visiting delegation 
from thailand on friday that he will intensify pressure on the 
soviets to bring about a settlement in cambodia thai foreign 
minister siddhi savetsila said 
in an interview with wire service reporters the thai official 
said reagan vowed during a brief meeting at the white house that he 
would raise the cambodia issue when he goes to moscow at the end of 
may for a summit with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
the situation in cambodia always has been on the ussoviet 
agenda of regional issues but thai officials have complained that 
at earlier summits the united states wasnt forceful enough in 
pressing the soviets to use their influence with vietnam to pull 
out of cambodia 
savetsila said the soviet decision to withdraw from afghanistan 
after eight years raises hopes that the cambodian situation will 
emerge as the top item on the ussoviet agenda on regional hot 
spots 
the occupation of cambodia by vietnam which receives armaments 
and vast economic aid from moscow has been blamed for unrest and 
violence along the thai border and for causing hundreds of 
thousands of people to flee into thailand 
igor rogachev the soviet deputy foreign minister for asian 
affairs told officials in bangkok earlier this week that his 
nations influence with the vietnamese is limited savetsila said 
however if the soviets are willing to do it they can pressure 
vietnam to withdraw 
i think the soviets are eager to have some political solution 
to the cambodian problem savetsila said 
savetsila denounced a proposal by sen larry pressler rsd 
that the united states open a diplomatic interest section in 
vietnam to coordinate usvietnamese efforts to find the estimated 
1700 american servicemen still listed as missing in vietnam after 
the vietnam war 
at a time when southeast asian and western nations are pressing 
vietnam to pull out of cambodia the opening of such a diplomatic 
office would send the wrong signal the foreign minister said 
savetsila said he exchanged assurances with reagan and with 
deputy secretary of state john c whitehead that both nations would 
continue to play their appointed roles in the ongoing indochina 
refugee crisis 
thailand reluctantly has agreed to continue as the country of 
firstasylum for the refugees as long as other countries like 
the united states promise to resettle them since 1975 more than 
675000 refugees have fled vietnam cambodia and laos and many of 
them still remain in camps in thailand 
united nations refugee workers backed by us officials have 
complained in recent months that refugees fleeing in boats have 
been pushed back to sea by thai authorities savetsila repeated 
thai assertions that smugglers not thai officials were 
responsible for harming the refugees 
given what he termed refugee fatigue the growing 
disinclination by the thai people to care for the influx of 
refugees it would be counterproductive for the united states 
to berate his country about its refugee policies savetsila said 
meanwhile reagan sent to the senate for ratification a treaty 
with thailand covering mutual assistance in criminal matters which 
was signed in bangkok on march 19 1986 
the treaty is one of a series being negotiated by the united 
states to assist in prosecution of members of drug cartels white 
collar criminals and terrorists it provides for cooperation in 
such things as the taking of testimony serving documents and 
executing requests for searches and seizures

state officials say a black robeson county 
jail inmate probably would still be alive if jail workers had 
called an ambulance more quickly after he fell ill but the sheriff 
of the racially divided county accused investigators of slipshod 
work 
billy mckellar died jan 12 after an asthma attack in the jail 
and his death and the tensions it created was cited as a factor in 
the takeover of the robesonian newspaper office for several hours 
the following month 
the response time was initially slow after the jailer was 
notified of the problem and was inexcusably slow after he 
verified the situation later said phil kirk chairman of a 
special task force appointed by gov jim martin to study the 
mckellar case 
the task force was formed after the newspaper takeover which 
ended peacefully tuscarora indians eddie hatcher and timothy 
jacobs are accused of taking hostages at the robesonian and 
demanding an investigation into the death of mckellar and other 
alleged corruption among law enforcement officials in robeson 
county 
since then the predominantly rural county whose population is 
almost evenly divided among whites blacks and indians has also 
been rocked by the shooting death of an indian activist who was 
running for judge authorities later blamed the death on a romantic 
dispute not political differences 
the state report released by kirk says that jailers failed to 
respond properly to mckellars asthma attack jan 12 but kirk said 
the negligence was not criminal 
there was neglect but we couldnt find any reason to suggest 
that it was intentional kirk told the winstonsalem journal on 
thursday we didnt see any criminal intent just neglect of 
duty 
the report further concludes that a staffing shortage a broken 
alarm system and mckellars periodic refusal to take his medication 
all contributed to his death 
sheriff hubert stone condemned the report 
there are enough generalities and loose ends in the narrative 
to make your report seem more an allegation than an 
investigation stone wrote in a formal response 
i think thats just political rhetoric just defensive 
talk kirk said were not out to get stone if we had been we 
wouldnt have asked for his comments 
mckellar became sick near dinner time according to the report 
and several inmates began calling the jailer for help the jailer 
who was doing two jobs at once because the jail was shortstaffed 
that evening didnt come until 643 pm when he passed through 
the cell block on his regular rounds 
at that time the jailer gave mckellar a pill but mckellars 
condition didnt improve prompting the inmates to renew their 
calls for help the report said 
the jailer called an ambulance for mckellar at 841 pm the 
vehicle arrived three minutes later just as mckellar slumped over 
without breath or pulse the report says 
dr john butts the states chief medical examiner who assisted 
the task force in investigating the death said an ambulance should 
have been called earlier even calling an ambulance roughly 20 
minutes earlier would probably have saved the inmate he said 
meanwhile a lawyer for accused hostagetaker jacobs said friday 
that his car was shot at in robeson county as he drove to interview 
a witness but he refused to report the incident to local 
authorities 
this was a snipertype thing said bob warren i was shot 
at but we are not going to be intimidated 
warren said the incident occurred at about 240 pm wednesday 
in lumberton he did not report the incident officially for almost 
24 hours when he filled out a report at the police department in 
carrboro where his office is based about 100 miles from the scene 
of the incident 
i wasnt about to go to the people in robeson county warren 
said im investigating them we asked the fbi to come in but 
they refused because they said it was a local matter 
the constitution is not in effect in robeson county he 
said thats why we have to go to these ridiculous extremes 
the carrboro police report said an unspecified projectile 
hit the windshield of warrens car and that ballistics tests would 
be needed to determine whether it was a bullet

the new owners of united press international 
asked a federal court friday to rule they have no collective 
bargaining agreement with the wire service guild and to deny the 
unions demand for arbitration 
new upi inc united press international inc and mario vazquez 
rana filed suit in us district court here claiming their 
obligation to abide by an expired bargaining agreement ended nov 
1 1987 after 92 bargaining sessions over a sevenmonth period 
the union filed its demand for arbitration with the american 
arbitration association on jan 27 1988 citing an evergreen 
provision of the bargaining agreement that allows the pact to 
continue during negotiations 
the issue is whether the evergreen clause is in effect only 
during fruitful negotiations said dwight geduldig a spokesman 
for upi in washington the last negotiations were not fruitful 
negotiations were last held in march but both union and upi 
spokesmen characterized them as unsuccessful and nonproductive 
it appears that the company is not interested in seeking a 
constructive relationship with the union said sean mccormally 
an editor on upis washington desk who is also the unions chairman 
of negotiations 
everyone agrees including management that a strike would 
be lethal to the company mccormally said we are interested in 
seeing the company survive why management is interested in 
brutalizing the company i dont know 
geduldig said that the company is unwilling to bargain with 
union officials 
there are no negotiations scheduled at this time and it is 
difficult to say that there will be future arbitration geduldig 
said 
the suit affects between 500 and 600 of the companys more than 
800 employees on the news and photo staffs of the wire serices 
international news operations 
upi announced march 30 that they would seek to reach 
profitability within two years by eliminating 150 jobs focusing on 
business news and embarking on joint electronic ventures 
chairman earl w brian and president paul steinle acquired 
operating control of upi from vazquez rana on feb 19 
upi lost 20 million in 1987 
brian is chairman of wnw group the media investment company 
that operates upi and of infotech a new yorkbased information 
technology and venture capital firm 
vazquez rana rescued upi from chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings 
in june 1986 by purchasing the company for 41 million he 
reportedly put an additional 50 million into upi before he 
relinquished control of his stock for 10 years to brians wnw group 
in february for an undisclosed cash payment

a special commission on friday 
criticized the investigation into the 1986 assassination of prime 
minister olof palme and recommended the creation of a parttime 
police unit to combat terrorism 
the commission headed by a former district governor and 
including a former prime minister also proposed stripping courts 
of the power to deport suspected terrorists and giving that 
authority to the government 
parliament appointed the sevenmember panel 13 months ago 
commission members told a news conference they still had no clue to 
the identity of palmes killer or his motive 
the commission was named to review earlier inquiries into the 
assassination of palme who was shot to death as he and his wife 
strolled along a stockholm street on feb 28 1986 it also was 
told to recommend crimefighting procedures 
reports from the earlier investigations said police responded 
slowly to the killing and criticized procedures in organizing the 
search for the gunman 
sweden where violent crimes and political violence are rare 
has resisted forming an antiterrorist squad with opponents saying 
such a force could introduce a brutalizing element into police 
work 
to counter such a possibility the special commission suggested 
a 50member elite unit with officers assigned to regular police 
duties twothirds of the time and antiterrorist work the remaining 
third 
it would be up to the government to convene the force for 
possible action and the cabinet would have a special security 
adviser 
commission chairman ragnar edenman said hans holmer the 
stockholm police chief who headed the assassination investigation 
for the first year abused his power by focusing on a kurdish 
exile group and ignoring the advice of civilian prosecutors 
in sweden prosecutors conduct criminal investigations in 
conjunction with police and advise officers on evidence needed for 
convictions 
edenman said prosectors should take a stronger role and police 
should be the instruments of the prosecutors 
panel members included thorbjorn falldin a conservative 
politician who was prime minister between two socialist 
administrations headed by palme and representatives of other 
political parties in parliament 
the commission dismissed proposals that bodyguards be mandatory 
for all cabinet ministers it is out of the question to force 
these persons by law to have a bodyguard the report said 
palme had given his bodyguards the evening off on the night when 
he was killed he was shot in the back as he was walking home with 
his wife lisbet after attending a movie

new interim rules have been adopted which will 
gradually put into effect federal restrictions on the height of 
hoof pads used on tennessee walking horses and other show horses to 
give them distinctive gaits the agriculture department said friday 
the new rules will take effect on monday said james w glosser 
acting administrator of the departments animal and plant health 
inspection service 
from april 25 through july 31 pads may be no more than three 
inches high from aug 1 through oct 31 two inches and 
effective nov 1 no more than onehalf inch high covering the sole 
of the foot 
at that time however an additional halfinchhigh rim pad 
will be allowed between the full pad and the shoe all pads must be 
made of leather or other similar soft pliable material 
glosser said the new rules prohibit chains or rollers that weigh 
more than six ounces including the weight of the fastener weights 
on the hoof other than the specified pads are also prohibited 
except for horseshoes weighing up to 16 ounces 
glosser said the reason the restrictions on pad height are being 
phasedin is to prevent trauma to show horses many of which 
currently have pads that are four inches high 
to remove fourinch pads abruptly could cause stress on a 
horses feet and limbs he said 
the new rules allow gradual reductions to reach a pad height 
that could not reasonably be expected to causing soring glosser 
said 
agency officials will continue to monitor horse shows and work 
with the industry to prevent soring he said 
if we find sored horses we will take action against the 
responsible parties regardless of the devices used glosser said 
the horse protection act was passed in 1970 to eliminate the 
practice of soring to produce special gaits in horses 
soring is the use of cruel methods devices or chemical 
substances on a horses legs or feet that can reasonably be 
expected to cause a horse to experience pain when walking the 
agency said in its statement soring is done primarily to alter a 
horses gait in the show ring 
the new interim rules apply to all breeds of horses at shows or 
sales the agency said 
on march 21 a us district court here in a lawsuit brought 
against usda by the american horse protection association 
invalidated certain sections of the departments horse protection 
regulations 
in the court order and a clarifying order issued april 13 the 
court directed usda to initiate rulemaking to eliminate devices 
that could reasonably be expected to cause soring the agency said 
the court specifically referred to pads and chains used on the 
front feet and legs of horses to alter their gaits 
before the court order there was no limit on the height of pads 
in usdas regulations except for those on yearling horses 
although the industry had its own rule limiting pads to four inches 
the previous usda regulations also put a 16ounce weight limit 
on horseshoes for yearlings but had no weight limit on shoes for 
older horses the weight limit on chains was eight ounces for 
twoyearolds and 10 ounces for horses three years or older

two small pyramids built for the wives of pharoah 
pepi i were discovered under mounds of sand by french scientists 
who say the find could shed light on a dynasty that ruled egypt 
more than 2000 years before jesus was born 
the discovery was announced friday by members of the french 
archaeological mission at sakkara and scientists from electricite 
de france the stateowned utility which conducted a hightech 
exploration at the site about 20 miles south of cairo 
the sakkara site contains the step pyramid built by king zoser 
said to be the first stone structure in history and other 
pyramids the discovery of the queens tombs brings to 85 the 
number of known pyramids in egypt 
one pyramid is in ruins but the second could contain 
subterranean funeral chambers decorated with hieroglyphics said 
jacques montlucon who led the utilitys team 
in the 19th century the 50acre sakkara site served as a quarry 
from which stone was taken for building in cairo for the last 25 
years or so extensive digging around the pyramid of pepi i has 
left a field of rubble at the site 
it looks like a battlefield there said montlucon adding 
that the pyramids were covered by eight meters about 26 feet 
of rubbish 
in such disturbed land it would be practically impossible to 
find anything to know where to begin to dig without our current 
technology he said 
last summer montlucon supervised the conservation of artifacts 
retrieved from the wreck of the titanic 
he said the electromagnetic tests used at sakkara were developed 
by the french utility for conducting geophysical tests at potential 
nuclear reactor sites 
using test results the team put together a map pinpointing five 
possible pyramid sites three sites were then excavated 
the first hole revealed a highly decorated mastaba or tomb of 
a dynastic official weeks passed before workers finally hit the 
stone of a pyramid on feb 12 
i was in the big pyramid when the foreman came running in 
shouting mabrouk congratulations montlucon said i felt 
so happy i could have cried 
workers dug out a buttonhole through which they could see a 
segment of the pyramid wall smooth and gold in color the french 
archaeological team will ask permission from the eygptian 
antiquities organization to begin full excavation next year on the 
pyramid thought to be 66 feet tall and 66 feet at the base 
the find is a big gain for egyptology and will allow us to 
know more possibly a great deal more about the 6th dynasty that 
ruled the nile valley from 2420 to 2258 bc montlucon said 
archaeologists are hoping the pyramid contains hieroglyphic 
inscriptions that can be added to the pyramid texts the oldest 
writings known to man the archaeologists also hope the writing 
will reveal the name of the pharaohs wife shrouded by the 
centuries who is buried there

the us congress should act on its own to clean 
up acid rain since the reagan administration has refused to do so 
prime minister brian mulroney said friday 
in an interview with american reporters before an official visit 
to washington next week mulroney said 
the united states would be pretty upset with me if i were 
dumping my garbage in your backyard well this is whats happening 
except its coming from above 
canada claims that 50 percent of the acid rain damaging its 
waterways and forests comes from us smokestacks across the 
border for more than seven years it has urged the united states 
to legislate reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide 
president reagan on advice from the environmental protection 
agency says more research is needed before embarking on costly 
cleanup measures 
i dont accept his view at all said mulroney who has built 
otherwise close relations with his fellow conservative 
when lakes and rivers and streams and forests are dying before 
your eyes you dont need a great deal of further research 
in parliament friday opposition liberal party member herb gray 
accused reagan of believing acid rain is caused by ducks birds 
and trees and demanded that mulroney present the united states 
with a multimilliondollar bill for damage to canadian forests and 
lakes 
but mulroney interviewed in his office said he favored the 
civil approach all nations have differences he said do you 
declare a war 
he said he had not given up on reagan but will use an 
invitation to address both houses of congress next wednesday to 
urge american legislators to act on their own 
ill accept an acid rain treaty irrespective of which end of 
pennsylvania avenue initiates action the prime minister said 
he said many members of congress support the fight against acid 
rain and he forecast that all three leading contenders for the 
presidency republican vice president george bush and democrats 
michael dukakis and jesse jackson would be strong advocates for 
the environment 
but he added im not pinning my hopes on any individual 
canada reports 14000 lifeless lakes and 19 barren salmon rivers 
because of acid rain it began its own cleanup in 1985 aimed at 
reducing its sulfur emissions 50 percent by 1994 it wants the 
united states to do the same 
mulroney said there will be a treaty eventually on cutting down 
on crossborder acid rain that is for certain the only question 
is when it wont be tomorrow but its going to come sooner 
rather than later 
he said americans should care that they are ruining the 
northeastern part of the continent and damaging relations with 
their best friend neighbor and ally canada 
despite press speculation that he will call an election this 
fall a year before his fiveyear term expires mulroney said 
im not even thinking about an election 
the 49yearold leader of the progressive conservative party 
said his government has a full legislative program this year 
including ratification of the free trade agreement with the united 
states a constitutional accord recognizing quebec as a distinct 
society a day care program and the privatization of air canada 
weve got a hell of a lot of business to do before im going 
to start considering elections he said 
he forecast victory when he does call an election the latest 
polls indicate the three canadian parties neckandneck and the 
conservatives on the rise

to 29 people broke apart after catching fire in the north atlantic 
and search units reported no sign of survivors friday 
lt cmdr kent fisher of the us coast guard in new york said a 
merchant vessel recovered the burned body of a man who had a polish 
passport and was carrying the ships registry papers the victim 
was identified only as a 41yearold man 
fisher said there had been 24 crew members and five women the 
wives of crewmen aboard the 500foot tanker athenian venture 
the greekowned ship had an allpolish crew according to the 
coast guard spokesman 
the vessel apparently exploded and came apart he said the 
bow section about onesixth of the ships length sank friday 
afternoon and the stern was still burning friday night 
two longrange aircraft would continue patrolling the area where 
the body was found in case there are survivors fisher said 
the crippled tanker which had not radioed any distress signals 
was first spotted just after midnight by the canadian research ship 
hudson 370 miles southeast of cape race newfoundland 
the hudson initially reported one of the tankers lifeboats had 
been launched and a canadian coast guard spokesman said three 
liferafts and a lifeboat were missing from the tanker leading to 
hope there might be survivors 
but fisher said later there were no indications anyone had lived 
we cant take a great deal of stock in the meaning of that 
fisher said of the early report from the hudson further 
inspection from the hudson indicates it the lifeboat may have 
burned in the cradle the loading gear was undisturbed 
the us coast guard is coordinating the search 
the cypriotregistered tanker owned by patron marine of athens 
was headed for new york from amsterdam with a load of gasoline 
according to fisher 
on friday afternoon the stern of the 18000ton tanker was still 
ablaze in rain squalls and winds exceeding 55 mph that whipped up 
5foot swells 
fisher said there was no indication of the cause of fire 
he said the vessel was only identified by the coast guard 
through contacts with companies known to have tankers in the area 
capt loran strum of the hudson said the tanker was burning 
fiercely and had already broken in two by the time his ship 
approached 
we could see fire through the house windows so shes all 
burned out in the bridge sector strum said in a shiptoshore 
radio interview i think i could quite safely say it would be 
impossible for anyone to be alive aboard 
we did get in under the bow to get a look he said the 
paint is so blistered that there is no name there is not even a 
vestige of a name visible 
strum a 37year veteran of the sea said a column of smoke from 
the tankers sterm could be seen for 30 miles 
participating in the search were two canadian aurora aircraft 
from greenwood nova scotia a us coast guard c130 hercules from 
north carolina the hudson the canadian fisheries patrol boat cape 
roger and an italianregistered ship 
in ottawa trade minister john crosbie told the house of commons 
an oil slick was spotted but it posed no threat to canadian fishing 
grounds because ocean currents would carry the oil to the northeast 
and farther out to sea

a republican challenge to the 
prodemocratic reapportionment of californias congressional 
districts in 1982 has been rejected by a federal court panel 
in a decision made public friday the panel voted 21 to dismiss 
a suit by republicans that claimed the drawing of district 
boundaries by the democraticcontrolled legislature violated the 
constitutional rights of gop voters to equality in voting 
the court said a partisan reapportionment is unconstitutional 
only if one party is effectively shut out of the political 
process republicans cannot make that claim in california as they 
hold the governors office a us senate seat and 40 percent of 
the house seats the court said 
california republicans represent so potent a political force 
that it is unnecessary for the judiciary to intervene said the 
opinion by judge cecil poole of the 9th us circuit court of 
appeals 
us district judge alfonso zirpoli joined his opinion us 
district judge robert schnacke said he would file a dissenting 
opinion later 
lawyers for republican officials and voters who filed the suit 
in 1983 said they would appeal to the supreme court and hoped for a 
ruling that would affect the 1990 congressional elections 
democrats have a 2718 majority in the states congressional 
delegation the district lines were drawn by the late rep phil

president augusto pinochet indicated 
friday that he would like to be the sole candidate in a 
presidential plebiscite scheduled for later this year 
speaking before about 4500 women the 72yearold president and 
army commander said chileans will be asked in the plebiscite to say 
whether they want president pinochet to stay or not 
under a 1980 constitution drafted by the military regime 
chileans will vote in 1988 on whether to approve as president a 
single candidate chosen by the military 
should a plurality vote yes pinochet will serve an eightyear 
term starting on march 11 1989 if most people vote no an open 
competitive presidential election would be scheduled in 1990 
it had been widely believed that pinochet would be the sole 
candidate but fridays speech at vina del mar a sea resort 75 
miles northwest of santiago marked the first time that he 
indicated he was seeking reelection 
pinochet told the crowd friday that the real question in the 
plebiscite will be whether citizens want the government to 
continue or not whether they want president pinochet to continue 
or not 
the women replied with a resounding yes 
according to the constitution the candidate in the plebiscite 
will be chosen by the commanders of the army the air force the 
navy and the national police as army commander in chief pinochet 
takes part in the nomination 
pinochet said the commanders will have to decide whether the 
one who is the president now has done a good job or a bad job 
its up to them now to make a decision he told the cheering 
audience 
the navy commander adm jose toribio merino and the air force 
chief gen fernando matthei have repeatedly stated that they 
would prefer a civilian candidate the have also said however 
that should pinochet resign his army command he would become a 
civilian 
no date has been set for the ballot but officials have hinted 
it could take place on sept 11 the 15th anniversary of the 
military coup led by pinochet that ousted elected president 
salvador allende a marxist 
in a statement issued at the end of a threeday closed meeting 
the nations roman catholic bishops called friday on military 
leaders to pick a candidate and choose a date for the plebiscite 
promptly 
the sooner the date and the candidate are known the more 
transparent will be the process the chilean episcopal conference 
said 
the bishops also said they hoped the ballot would be secret 
free and informed that the number of voters be 
representative and that there be a guarantee of 
impartiality in the vote count 
if these conditions are not met the plebiscite will lack the 
moral justness needed to sustain its validity the bishops said

jesse jackson said it is too early to be giving out coronation 
roses for frontrunner michael dukakis as the democrats held 
their first oneonone debate friday and joked about choosing a 
vice presidential nominee for the fall 
i look forward to choosing a running mate mike looks forward 
to chosing a running mate jackson said but however it goes 
when its all said and done and coming out of the democratic 
national convention in atlanta we will come out as a unit to send 
the reaganbush forces back to private life 
it was a goodnatured hourlong confrontation between the two 
surviving democrats five days before the pennsylvania primary 
there was little heated rhetoric in the debate and what existed 
was directed at vice president george bush and the reagan 
administration echoing the themes from the candidates day of 
campaigning across the state 
jackson did press dukakis seriously on policy toward south 
africa which jackson said sponsored terrorism 
i would be very tough on south africa the massachusetts 
governor replied 
the no 2 spot on the democratic ticket in the fall was a major 
topic of the debate the first in the twoman endgame for the 
nomination as it has been since dukakis took a giant step toward 
the presidential nomination with his new york victory on tuesday 
during the debate sponsored by the pennsylvania democratic 
party jackson was asked if he wanted the vice presidential spot 
its a bit premature to be giving out coronation roses for the 
governor and taps for me jackson said were now moving into 
the last lap of a significant race and im a longdistance runner 
i look forward to it 
then dukakis turned to jackson and asked in a soft voice 
are you interested 
jackson smiled and replied you got it mike 
later dukakis was asked how he could win in the south in the 
general election jackson added his analysis 
mike dukakis on my ticket will win the south provoking 
laughter from the audience at the university of pennsylvania campus 
in philadelphia 
asked if he believed polls saying jackson as vice president 
would hurt dmeocratic chances in the fall dukakis gave a oneword 
answer no 
jackson was late arriving for the debate walking onto the stage 
about three minutes after it began he shook dukakis hand and then 
the two held their clasped hands high like prizefighters 
both men pleaded with voters to ignore the polls which give 
dukakis a big lead in the state 
people ought to vote conscience courage and conviction if 
they do they will vote for jesse jackson or at least they will 
vote for their choice jackson said i give you a choice you 
give me a chance i will make you a good president when i win 
there are no more imnpossible american dreams 
during the debate both men repeated the themes they used 
campaigning friday 
dukakis praised the trade bill moving through congress saying 
it would be a tragedy if president reagan vetoed the measure 
over a provision requiring companies to give a 60day notice before 
shutting down a plant 
a very modest very mild 60day notice provision seems to me 
to be just simple justice for workers and working families 
dukakis said while campaigning in toledo ohio 
jackson turned his attention to central america 
your generation must go beyond war in latin america he told 
students at a rally at west chester state university near 
philadelphia were not threatened by three million sandinistas 
and if so we cant be saved by 15000 contras 
dukakis aides said the massachusetts governor was spending 
100000 on television advertising in pennsylvania in advance of 
next tuesdays primary a relatively modest amount that reflects 
his status as overwhelming favorite in the race 
bush his nomination secure and his general election campaign 
planning well under way spent the day fishing in florida 
his aides speaking on condition of anonymity depicted the vice 
president as being uncomfortable with embattled attorney general 
edwin meese iiis refusal to resign but bush himself has not 
called for meeses resignation 
the vice president attended a white house meeting on wednesday 
with president reagan at which two departing justice department 
officials said they thought meeses presence was damaging the 
department 
in a full day of campaigning in advance of the debate dukakis 
accused bush of failing to understand what it takes to build an 
economic future and to create good jobs 
previewing a line of attack he is expected to use in the fall 
campaign the massachusetts governor said i dont see how we are 
going to bring good jobs and good wages back to the industrial 
midwest unless we work together if the vice president doesnt 
understand that then he shouldnt be running for president 
the democratic frontrunner also attacked the republican 
nomineeapparent for saying he wants to be the education 
president 
how can he say that after the last seven years dukakis 
asked a crowd of students at mercyhurst college in erie pa 
after seven years of an administration that has slammed a door in 
the face of millions of youngsters looking for a chance to go to 
college after seven years of treating education as if it were 
a privilege for the few instead of a right and a necessity for 
every american 
in his speech dukakis called for a national teaching excellence 
fund and an education security fund to boost teachers and to make 
more college loans available to students he said his ideas would 
cost an additional 250 million in federal spending 
dukakis had a full campaign day across ohio and pennsylvania 
seeking bluecollar votes in the nations industrial heartland the 
pennsylvania primary is next tuesday with ohio and indiana voting 
on may 3 
youre looking at someone who is a trueblue 
dyedinthewool fullemployment democrat he told workers 
outside a ford plant in maumee ohio 
at the ford plant and at a steel plant in pittsburgh dukakis 
emphasized his support for government working in partnership with 
business and labor to save jobs 
asked by a reporter about a bush statement that government must 
stay out of the private sector dukakis replied at a toledo airport 
news conference 
i dont think the vice president understands what it takes to 
build an economic future and to create good jobs 
government shouldnt do it all im a strong believer in the 
free enterprise system but we need a president who will be a 
strong partner who will help with some resources some 
support he said its the public private partnerships that are 
making the difference all over the country thats what ive been 
doing in massachusetts

with the superpower summit only five weeks off 
secretary of state george p shultz chipped away on arms control 
problems and regional disputes with soviet leaders friday but 
apparently made little headway 
maybe were marking time general secretary mikhail s 
gorbachev declared 
shultz challenged the soviet leaders assessment from our 
point of view were far from marking time he told reporters at 
the windup of two days of talks but he said the going is hard 
in trying to conclude an arms treaty in time for president reagan 
and gorbachev to sign at their may 29june 2 summit meeting here 
the official news agency tass said that during the meeting 
gorbachev attacked recent statements by president reagan 
the agency said gorbachev told shultz that despite a recent 
warming in superpower relations sermons are again being 
delivered to us and we are being instructed on how we should behave 
ourselves our foreign policy is being assessed only negatively 
while the policy of the us administration is assessed only 
positively 
morever everything that has been achieved in sovietamerican 
relations is being ascribed to the policy of strength and putting 
pressure on the soviets the soviet leader told shultz 
according to the agency 
we are not going to reeducate the united states and do not 
recognize that it has any right to reeducate us gorbachev was 
quoted as saying 
the soviet leader was apparently referring to a foreign policy 
speech given by reagan thursday in springfield mass in it the 
president said that the united states and the soviet union cannot 
have a normal relationship unless moscow changes its ways and 
stops interfering in nations such as afghanistan 
in a joint statement friday the us and soviet teams said 
negotiators would deal with the disputed issues on a priority 
basis 
they reaffirmed their strong commitment to make an intensive 
effort to complete the treaty and said the summit should mark 
another important step in the process of building a more stable and 
constructive relationship 
shultz was scheduled to leave saturday to visit kiev and 
tbilisi stop in brussels to brief the north atlantic treaty 
organization on monday and then fly home 
he will hold another session with foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze before the moscow summit probably in geneva around 
may 10 
its pick and shovel work shultz said of the uphill effort 
to complete the strategic arms reduction treaty or start to crown 
reagans fourth and probably final meeting with gorbachev 
at a news conference shevardnadze said he could not promise a 
strategic arms treaty before reagans visit and he criticized any 
attempt to rush negotiations 
sovietamerican relations are not some kind of a lightning 
chess match whose participants are making lightning moves and 
feverishly hit the buttons of the time clock the soviet envoy 
said it is far more important for us to know that the clock of 
our contacts have been now timed to achieve weighty tangible and 
stable positive results 
he suggested that without a treaty gorbachev and reagan could 
still sign a document stating progress toward an accord 
while us arms negotiators offered a new proposal in a dispute 
over airlaunched cruise missiles the treaty to sharply reduce 
us and soviet strategic nuclear weapons was still stymied in a 
dispute over star wars 
the us proposal was to count as nuclear weapons all cruise 
missiles carried by fighter planes even though some may be 
conventionally armed both sides would have the right to develop 
airlaunched cruises that were not nuclear and the weapons would 
not be covered by the treaty 
the idea is to bypass a dispute over verifying which of the 
cruise missiles are longrange nuclear arms 
the soviets agreed to study the proposal a senior us official 
said at a briefing for reporters under rules of anonymity 
another major stumbling block in completing the treaty is 
finding ways to monitor us and soviet weapons to make sure 
cutbacks are not circumvented 
on the regional front the soviets again refused to heed 
shultzs appeal for the united nations to declare an arms embargo 
against iran 
since the soviets have veto power on the un security council 
this means the united states is unable to move for un sanctions 
against iran the idea is to try to force compliance with a 
ceasefire ordered by the council last july in the iraniraq war 
shultz also could not persuade the soviet union to restore 
diplomatic relations with israel after a 21year break or to pledge 
to increase jewish emigration which hit a 15month high of 984 in 
march another us official said

the roman catholic church urged the 
united states friday to lift the economic sanctions it imposed on 
panama to oust strongman gen manuel antonio noriega saying they 
pose a threat to the life of our people 
the church said in an eightpage pastoral letter that the 
sanctions have strongly hit all the people above all the poorest 
and the most humble 
we consider that they exceed any strategy of political 
pressure and constitute by themselves a threat to the life of our 
people it said they are therefore morally unjust because 
of that we demand that they be suspended immediately 
in the same way we reject all forms of military 
intervention 
the sanctions block panamanian government assets in the united 
states bar payments by all people and organizations in the united 
states to the noriegacontrolled administration and ban payments 
to this administration by all us citizens and organizations in 
panama including us branches and subsidiaries 
the sanctions combined with closures of the banks and a 
twoweek strike in march have brought panamas economy to a 
virtual standstill 
the lack of money in circulation is bringing misery and 
desperation to thousands of panamanians and an exodus has started 
of citizens to foreign countries that is beginning to have 
worrisome dimensions the hierarchy of the catholic church said 
in its letter 
meanwhile delinquency in our cities is increasing in an 
alarming way it said adding that the crisis is turning panama 
into a sinister battle camp 
we cannot continue like this 
the letter was signed by archbishop marcos g mcgrath and the 10 
bishops of this predominantly roman catholic nation it asked the 
government and its opposition to start bargaining as soon as 
possible to arrange a solution to end the crisis 
the church agreed at the end of march to mediate the dispute 
but suspended the effort a week later 
financial analysts said earlier friday that the government was 
seeking an international organization to process a backlog of 
checks that have piled up since panamas banks closed seven weeks 
ago 
banking regulators have been rebuffed in previous attempts to 
get european or latin american banks to take over the clearinghouse 
operation 
a financial analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the officials wanted an international organization that would be 
beyond the scope of the united states 
the objective is to have the accounts with an 
organization that has diplomatic privileges and immunities he 
said 
three ministers including foreign minister jorge abadia 
meanwhile offered their resignations to panamas civilian chief 
executive manuel solis palma 
a copy of abadias letter of resignation addressed to solis 
palma was obtained by the associated press 
romulo escobar betancourt president of the democratic 
revolutionary party of the governing coalition identified the 
other two men as nander pitty velazquez minister of the 
presidency and candelario santana recently named to head the 
ministry of labor and social welfare 
the staterun newspaper critica said friday that solis palma was 
expected to name a war cabinet to confront the nations 
economic crisis 
noriega head of the military and generally considered the real 
ruler of the country is under indictment in the united states on 
federal drug trafficking charges he denied the charges 
noriega touched off the crisis on feb 26 when he deposed 
thenpresident eric arturo delvalle who tried to fire him a day 
earlier 
the action caused a run on panamas banks by nervous depositors 
the government ordered the approximately 120 banks closed on march 
3 after acknowledging it didnt have enough money to cover 
withdrawals 
panama had an estimated 50 million on deposit in american 
banks but that money was frozen by lawsuits filed to stop the 
noriegacontrolled government from withdrawing it 
with little money the national bank of panama has been unable 
to conduct a clearing operation for thousands of checks 
on monday the national banking commission a regulatory agency 
allowed the banks to reopen but only to accept deposits customers 
still cannot withdraw cash

an estimated 30 minority students 
took over a deans office at williams college on friday the eve of 
parents weekend at the prestigious liberal arts school 
a spokesman for the students who declined to identify himself 
said in a telephone interview that black hispanic asian and 
polynesian students occupied jenness house at 830 am the only 
member of the deans staff in the building at the time a 
secretary left at their request 
we took this action to protest the administrations 
unwillingness to address substantially fundamental issues relating 
to minority concerns at the college the group called the 
coalition against racism education said in a statement 
these issues relate to recruitment hiring goals and policies 
with regard to minority faculty staff and students the 
statement said they also relate to the broader issues of 
minority representation in the curriculum 
some 10 percent of the schools 278 faculty members and 13 
percent of its 2000 students are members of minority groups 
school spokesmen said 
at a friday evening news conference sean f mcpherson who said 
he was a senior from hilo hawaii and one of the protesters said 
his group had set up a formal meeting sunday with college president 
francis c oakley he said the outcome could determine whether the 
building takeover continues 
mcpherson said the protesters had spoken by phone with with 
administrators and were not asked to leave the building he said 
they were asked and agreed to keep away from confidential files 
witnesses said the protesters barricaded the doors and pulled 
down the window shades in the victorian house which is serving as 
a makeshift deans office while the main administration building is 
renovated 
the occupiers also hung a banner reading by any means 
necessary we shall not be moved 
shortly after noon dean of the college stephen fix issued a 
statement saying college officials had met with the students to 
discuss the important goals we share 
all of us in the college are prepared to continue such 
discussions in any atmosphere that is conducive to the free and 
open exchange of ideas fix said 
college spokeswoman ellen berek said she did not know if any 
meetings had been arranged although fix said he spoke to students 
briefly through a window as of late afternoon things at the scene 
were quiet said berek 
the students have vowed to stay put until the college responds 
to their demands which are apparently the same concerns that many 
of the same students sent to oakley march 4 
after receiving inadequate response we decided this action 
was necessary a protester said 
the protest came a day before the dedication of a baseball field 
and track by george n steinbrenner owner of the new york yankees 
baseball team and an alumnus 
steinbrenner whose son is a sophomore at the elite school is 
one of hundreds of alumni expected to return to the campus for the 
parents weekend 
in addition to criticism of minority hiring and curriculum the 
protesters spokesman said they were angry that a college advisory 
committee recently voted against urging three pharmaceutical 
companies in which the college owns stock to withdraw from south 
africa 
berek said the committee decided it was important for blacks in 
south africa to be able to buy the medicines the companies made 
in february minority students at the university of 
massachusetts and hampshire college in amherst more than 40 miles 
southeast of williamstown occupied buildings on their campuses for 
several days to protest racial discrimination 
those protests ended after the heads of the schools signed 
agreements to increase funding of minority projects and make other 
concessions 
students at wesleyan university in middleton conn continued 
their sitin at an administration building for a fifth day friday 
in a protest of the schools investments in south africa

former methodist minister walker railey is liable 
for the nearfatal choking of his wife a year ago a dallas county 
judge ruled friday 
judge john whittington made a default judgment against walker 
railey in a civil lawsuit filed by peggy raileys mother billie jo 
nicolai 
although he was served twice with the suit railey 40 never 
responded in court to the allegation he brutally attacked his wife 
if you bring allegations against the defendant and you give 
the defendant notice of the allegations and an opportunity to come 
in and respond to those allegations and he refuses to do that the 
court can hold the defendant liable and hold those allegations as 
true bill arnold attorney for mrs nicolai said friday 
the decision was announced a year and a day after mrs railey 
39 was found lying unconscious on her garage floor she has been 
in a coma since the attack 
railey former senior minister at first united methodist church 
has claimed he was doing research at southern methodist university 
on the night of the attack 
the suit asks for unspecified damages for mrs railey and her 
family the raileys two children are living with family friends in 
dallas 
arnold said a jury trial will be scheduled to decide the amount 
of damages probably this summer he said he plans to subpoena 
railey for the trial and seek a warrant for his arrest 
william nicolai mrs raileys father declined comment when

talk with police or answer questions before a grand jury no 
criminal charges have been filed although mulder has said railey 
is the only suspect 
railey surrendered his ministers credentials and moved to san 
francisco where he rented an apartment with lucy papillon ms 
papillon a psychologist told a grand jury she had been seeing 
railey and they had discussed marriage before the attack on his 
wife

the heart of an unidentified man 
found unconscious on a sidewalk was transplanted after he died 
causing debate friday among medical ethicists one of whom called 
the procedure incredible 
it seems to me this does not sit well with the way weve been 
doing things said michael shapiro an ethics professor at the 
university of southern california law center 
the heart transplant was the first at hoag medical center 40 
miles southeast of los angeles the recipient was dr norton 
humphreys 58 of fountain valley a former staff doctor who was 
suffering from degenerative heart disease and suffered two heart 
attacks in the past nine months 
he was awake alert and in good condition friday said hospital 
spokeswoman gail love 
the donor was an unidentified man believed to be a 20yearold 
costa mesa resident who was found unconscious in front of a 
convenience store hospital officials said 
police recovered from the man a temporary work card issued by 
the immigration and naturalization service and were checking the 
identity of the man pictured on the card said police lt rick 
johnson 
to take vital organs out of someone who is not identified is 
really incredible said george annas a law and ethics professor 
at boston universitys medical school if other people have done 
it they havent talked about it in the newspaper thats for 
sure 
it seems to me that that is a variation from practice in this 
country where someone generally has to agree to the donation 
shapiro said 
the man was declared brain dead tuesday after he was brought 
into the hospitals emergency room said dr aldan raney one of 
the cardiac surgeons who performed the transplant the donor also 
had traces of alcohol and cocaine in his urine hospital officials 
said 
they said doctors followed guidelines established in 
californias uniform anatomical gift act that require a 24hour 
police search for identification and relatives and questioning of 
visitors to the donor the man had no visitors 
raney and dr douglas zusman the surgeons that performed the 
transplant have performed more than 77 heart transplants between 
them 
annas said the hospital should have let at least 24 hours 
rather than six lapse between the time the donor was declared dead 
and the time the transplant began 
but john robertson an ethics professor at the university of 
texas in austin and a member of the national task force on organ 
transplantation said im not sure theres any serious abuse if 
theyre complying with applicable law 
first of all were dealing with someone who is dead its not 
like theyre harming the person that body is either going to get 
cremated or buried robertson said

the top investigator for the nuclear 
regulatory commission told congress on thursday that the tennessee 
valley authoritys nuclear manager knowingly and willfully 
misrepresented safety conditions at a tva plant 
disclosing publicly the conclusions of an investigation which 
was referred to the justice department months ago ben b hayes 
director of the nrc office of investigations testified that he 
believed that steven white the tvas nuclear chief deliberately 
misled the nrc 
white has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing 
the issue concerns a march 20 1986 letter written by white in 
which he assured the regulatory agency that there were no 
pervasive quality assurance problems at the stillunlicensed 
watts bar nuclear plant at spring city tenn 
hayes also questioned a subsequent white letter in which the tva 
manager told the commission that an independent review group had 
found no serious problems at the plant after a thorough study 
in fact said hayes several of the men cited by white as 
participants of that group told investigators that they hadnt 
reviewed the matter nor did they discuss it with mr white 
others signed off on a short memo about watts bar but filed no 
longer report 
tva chairman marvin runyon defended white in a statement 
released late thursday saying the tva board has complete 
confidence in white the board fully supports his managment of 
tvas nuclear recovery program we believe it is important to 
note that there has been disagreement among the nuclear regulatory 
commission staff itself over whether steven white misled the nrc 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy 
subcommittee on oversight and investigations criticized the nrc 
for recently approving the restart of another tva nuclear plant 
sequoyah while there were unresolved questions concerning the 
integrity and believability of the tva nuclear managers 
but nrc chairman lando zech said the commission concluded that 
immediate regulatory action prior to restart of sequoyah was not 
necessary as a result of the hayes investigation this limited 
conclusion does not mean that there is no regulatory action 
anticipated as a result of the findings 
the justice department has declined any comment on the status of 
the white case since hayes referred it last october but an nrc 
review group headed by assistant director of operations james 
taylor disagreed with hayes conclusion that whites misstatements 
were deliberate 
hayes testified that white was deliberately playing word games 
based on consultations with aides and his personal attorney when 
he said there were no pervasive breakdowns at watts bar white 
said hayes apparently was relying on a definition of pervasive as 
100 per cent 
while it was technically correct that the plant didnt violate 
all quality assurance standards it did have serious and widespread 
problems according to the nrc 
hayes said whites letters amount to material false 
statements but the taylor group concluded that while they may 
have been off base they did not violate the law 
rep jim cooper dtenn defended white who was brought in to 
salvage the tvas longplagued nuclear operation he said white is 
caught in the spiders web of confusion and misunderstanding

against three cigarette makers in a cancerliability case but 
ruled there is sufficient evidence for a jury to decide whether the 
companies conspired to cover up the dangers of smoking 
the evidence presented permits the jury to find a tobacco 
industry conspiracy vast in its scope devious in its purpose and 
devastating in its results us district judge h lee sarokin 
said thursday 
however the judge also dismissed claims that the three 
companies caused rose cipollones cancer by not marketing a safer 
cigarette and by not conducting adequate research into the health 
effects of smoking

sex is coming out of the closet in china 
with the help of a group of sociologists and medical personnel who 
want the chinese to have happy healthy sex lives 
we are very unconservative said shi ling director of the 
obstetricl and gynecological hospital of harbin and a member of 
chinas only sex science research society 
the 177member society was set up here last year to coordinate 
efforts of medical workers and sociologists at several harbin 
hospitals and institutions in addressing sexual problems 
harbin with its sovietstyle architecture and heavy industry in 
northeastern china seems an unlikely place for sex research and 
the study and treatment of sexual disorders 
but the city of 2 million has the nations first centers for 
treatment of male and female sexual disorders and the unique sex 
science research society 
members of the society say china can no longer ignore the sexual 
problems that many chinese live with 
sex has long been a forbidden subject said sociologist gao 
caiqin chairwoman of the institute of marriage and family 
planning no one was willing to talk about sex or sex problems 
but it is a very important problem 
no other disorder in the world is like sexual disorder in that 
it affects both partners said li jiqi head of the center for 
treatment and consultations of sexual disorders of men 
sooner or later we had to establish this clinic said yang 
jin director of the no 4 hospital which houses the male clinic 
we cant avoid this issue its a part of us but in the past 
nobody was willing to talk about it 
he said the clinic has received 4000 letters since it opened 
two years ago and has a yearlong waiting list for treatment 
similar clinics have been started since in other parts of the 
country but harbin is regarded as the leader in the field 
the male sexual disorders clinic has treated more than 3000 
patients and the center for treatment and consultations of sexual 
disorders of women at the obstetrical and gynecological hospital 
has handled 5000 cases of which 3000 were outpatients 
the open attitudes of the research society members are in sharp 
contrast to those of a traditionally puritanical and moralistic 
china 
the female sexual disorders center for example encourages 
women to experience orgasms during intercourse 
some problems the clinics handle are unique to china 
with the gradual rise in the standard of living young people 
are reaching puberty earlier the age at which girls begin to 
menstruate has dropped from 13 years to 11 and boys reach puberty 
at age 13 rather than 15 
however china has a strict policy of late marriage the legal 
age for marriage is 20 for women and 22 for men the highest in the 
world while late marriage helps keep chinas birth rate down it 
creates a nation of sexually frustrated young people 
the clinics offer them help 
members of the research society acknowledged that they have 
treated homosexuals and sufferers of venereal diseases two 
problems that chinese officials had previously claimed no longer 
existed in the country 
we do have homosexuals li said he added that the clinics 
surveys indicate three of every 1000 men in china is homosexual 
no figures were available on lesbians in china but shi ling of 
the obstetrical and gynecological hospital said their numbers are 
few and the female sexual disorders clinic has not treated any 
the chinese regard homosexuality as abnormal 
the cure used by the male sexual disorders clinic is to 
condition the homosexual not to be excited by men it either 
applies electric shocks or gives traditional chinese medicine that 
induces vomiting 
another problem dealt with by the society members is a growing 
number of young people engaging in premarital sex 
there is an obvious increase from the past of having sex 
before marriage shi said 
she added that no complete figures were available but her 
hospital has seen an increase in the number of unmarried pregnant 
women ranging in age from 14 to 25 seventy percent to 75 percent 
of the abortions the hospital performs on women in their second 
trimester of pregnancy are on unwed mothers shi said 
the incidences of premarital sex in china however still falls 
far below world levels shi said results of surveys of engaged 
couples have shown that more than 90 percent were still virgins 
the society members say they fight a battle on two fronts 
against what they call the ignorance and superstitions of 
traditional thinking and the sexual freedoms of western society 
we dont talk about creativity in sex life said ma ran 
deputy director the no 4 hospital and secretarygeneral of the 
research society we advise them how to have a healthy sex life 
society members insist however that their ultimate goal is to 
help people adjust sexually so that they can contribute to chinas 
socialist modernization

katutura southwest africa ap hilda shifidi an unwed 
mother of five who washes floors in a hospital for blacks wants to 
bring her fathers killers to justice to do that she is taking 
south africas president to court 
i am not afraid of him she said he did something wrong 
president pw botha halted the prosecution of six soldiers 
charged with killing her father the 56yearold political activist 
immanuel shifidi 
ms shifidi who says her 100 monthly salary barely pays the 
rent and utilities for her cramped fourroom house is the lone 
applicant in legal papers challenging bothas order 
but she was not the only one upset when botha blocked the trial 
in march of four white officers and two black enlisted men across 
south africa and southwest africa the territory commonly known as 
namibia the order brought an outcry from legal experts and liberal 
politicians 
namibias attorney general had accused the six soldiers of 
arranging for 54 black soldiers to dress in civilian clothes arm 
themselves with knives and clubs and ride by bus from a faraway 
army base to disrupt an opposition political rally in katutura a 
black township outside windhoek the territorial capital 
shifidi one of about 2000 people at the legal outdoor rally 
was fatally stabbed nov 30 1986 
bothas critics accused him of hypocrisy for intervening in this 
case just a few days after saying he should not interfere in the 
case of the sharpeville six a group of south african blacks 
sentenced to hang for complicity in a mob killing 
botha rejected worldwide appeals for clemency for the 
sharpeville defendants whose execution has been stayed while they 
seek a new trial 
in the shifidi case botha invoked a section of south africas 
defense act which empowers him to grant immunity to any soldier 
for any action committed in good faith in connection with the 
prevention or suppression of terrorism in any operational area 
the law is intended to protect soldiers who do wrong 
claimed ms shifidis lawyer hartmut ruppel at his office in 
windhoek 
ms shifidis application filed in the territorial supreme 
court on march 30 seeks to invalidate bothas order so that the 
murder trial can proceed no date has been set for a hearing and 
the south african government has not indicated what steps it will 
take to oppose the application 
ms shifidi who wore a workers unite tshirt during an 
interview at her katutura home said repeatedly that there is no 
justice under south african rule but she expressed hope her 
application would succeed 
speaking in the language of her ovambo tribe with a friend 
translating ms shifidi 35 said the accused soldiers must face 
the court and accept whatever sentence the court hands down 
her father was a founding member of the southwest african 
peoples organization swapo an independence movement that has 
been waging a guerrilla war against south african rule for 22 
years he served 18 years in prison for swapo activities then 
lived with his daughter in katutura for two years before his death 
swapos political wing is legal and the organization sponsored 
the rally at which shifidi was killed his daughter also was at the 
rally but was not nearby when he was stabbed 
under territorial laws swapo is permitted to function as a 
political organization although the activities of its guerrilla 
wing are outlawed 
ruppel said there is no evidence shifidi was a preselected 
target for assassination rather the lawyer added it appeared 
that army officers sought to discredit swapo and intimidate its 
supporters by provoking violence at its rally 
the application filed by ms shifidi contends botha had no basis 
for concluding that the six soldiers acted in good faith for the 
purpose of combatting terrorism 
botha failed to apply his mind to the facts or acted in 
bad faith or grossly unreasonably the application says 
the application also questions whether the katutura soccer field 
where the rally took place now called shifidi square could be 
accurately described as part of the armys operational area but 
ruppel said he expected the government to contend that the 
operational area extends to wherever soldiers are on duty 
it moves as quickly as you can move soldiers he said 
the section of the defense act invoked by botha says the 
president can act only if he deems that continuation of the court 
proceedings would harm the national interest 
two previous trials in namibia have been stopped by botha under 
terms of the defense act ruppel said in each case he added 
challenges were filed one was rejected and the other is pending 
ruppel said it was possible that if south african authorities 
lose to ms shifidi in windhoek supreme court they would appeal to 
an appellate court in south africa

each day indian newspapers recount the 
latest killings by sikh radicals in the province of punjab in 
northern india 
but 700 miles to the south a sikh general heads the indian 
armys southern command imposing sikh doormen usher guests into 
plush hotels in new delhi sikh drivers in turbans steer taxicabs 
through bombays chaotic traffic 
a sikh owns one of indias largest bottling plants 
maninder singh a sikh cricket player is one of indias sports 
stars 
known for their beards turbans and lately the brutal campaign 
for a separate sikh nation in punjab sikhs are an integral part of 
india and have been since long before the countrys independence 
from britain in 1947 
more than half the people hanged by the british in the freedom 
movement were sikhs said kushwant singh a journalist and writer 
known for his novels about indian independence and a scholarly 
history of his own sikh people 
sikhs are a mere 2 percent of indias 800 million people and 
most live in punjab a rich farming state on the pakistan border 
it is there that radicals have killed more than 770 people this 
year in their demand for an independent sikh nation 
but perhaps 4 million other sikhs are scattered around the rest 
of india they have a reputation for being aggressive and 
hardworking and many have achieved success 
in a survey of sikhs outside punjab the statesman newspaper 
found them running factories in uttar pradesh state in the north 
trading in cloth in bihar in the east and active in the lions club 
in kerala the southernmost indian state 
in bombay indias business capital sikhs have almost a 
monopoly in the auto parts trade and perhaps 10000 sikh taxi 
drivers ply the citys streets 
in much of india in fact the sikhs own or drive many of the 
cabs buses and trucks making them familiar to tourists in new 
delhi the militarylooking doormen at fivestar hotels are often 
sikhs chosen for their height which is accentuated by the turban 
with the martial tradition of their religion sikhs also have 
made their way in the army during world war i when indian 
soldiers served in the british army 14 of the 22 british military 
crosses warded to indians went to sikhs 
sikhs still make up 10 percent of indias army and even more 
among the officer corps 
in contrast to its later military role sikhism began as a 
pacifist faith in 15thcentury india founded by a hindu in 
reaction to the bloody rivalries of hindus and moslems 
the founder guru nanak rejected hinduisms caste system but 
kept many of its rituals combining them with islams belief in a 
single deity 
inevitably though the sikh faith was drawn into the clash of 
hindus and moslems after the moguls beheaded the ninth sikh 
prophet a defender of hindus his son guru gobind singh turned 
the sikhs to a warrior path in 1699 
the son decreed that all sikh men carry a knife be soldiers of 
the faith and use the name singh which means lion 
gobind singh also gave the sikhs their distinctive look by 
ruling they must never shave or cut their hair which is worn 
wrapped under the turban 
later it was an indian tradition for one son in a hindu family 
to be reared a sikh to act as a defender of both religions 
the sikh radical campaign in punjab however has strained the 
bond between the two religions after prime minister indira gandhi 
was assassinated by two sikh bodyguards in 1984 rioting in 
northern india killed 3000 people most of them sikhs 
even today sikhs outside punjab say they are made to feel 
separate by indias dominant hindus who are 80 percent of the 
countrys people 
the sikh is regarded with suspicion said kushwant singh 
who noted that sikhs complain of especially stringent security 
checks at airports and that sikh taxi drivers have more serious 
problems at police checkpoints 
pratap singh who runs a new delhi taxi stand said five of his 
six sikh drivers have cut their hair and shaved to avoid being 
associated with the radicals in punjab 
it means a special check the moment the driver is a sikh they 
stop us make us open the boot car trunk want to know whats in 
the passengers luggage its not our right to ask the passengers 
what they carry 
pratap singh whose own house was set ablaze during the 1984 
antisikh riots wore a bright red turban during an interview at 
his taxi stand 
as long as the punjab problem goes on the problem here is not 
going to be solved he said 
kushwant singh the writer said sikhs outside punjab are the 
sharpest critics of the separatist concept because they are most 
hurt by it 
theyre developing a feeling of being held as hostages they 
bear the brunt of the hindu backlash when it comes 
he also said sikhs elsewhere in india often have no connection 
with punjab many he added fled from moslem pakistan to various 
parts of india when the two countries were divided at independence 
from britain in 1947 
the statesman newspaper also found that most sikhs outside 
punjab oppose a separate sikh state because they have built lives 
elsewhere some have taken up the telegu language of andhra pradesh 
or malayalam in kerala in place of the punjabi tongue 
kushwant singh said however that opposition to a separate 
khalistan the radicals name for their wouldbe country did not 
mean the sikhs approved of the governments handling of the punjab 
situation 
he said sikhs everywhere were disappointed in the governments 
failure to foster industry in punjab and were hurt by its refusal 
to prosecute hindu agitators blamed for starting the 1984 riots 
asked if the violence in punjab and the reaction to it made 
sikhs feel less indian he responded i feel the indian 
government isnt indian enough

americans loved the jewel in the crown the tv 
epic that made art malik famous and if the pakistanborn actor is 
right about his upcoming series americans will also warm to the 
black tower 
if youre an anglophile living in america youre going to 
love it the 35yearold actor said of the sixpart thriller 
which starts april 28 on pbs stations it projects a very 
countrified rarefied atmosphere 
the fourth miniseries to be adapted from a pd james thriller 
the show brings roy marsden back to the screen as chief inspector 
adam dalgliesh who this time is investigating a series of murders 
at a private nursing home toynton grange in the english 
countryside 
malik plays the elegantly dressed julius court toynton granges 
principal benefactor and a man whose motives may not be what they 
seem 
the actor said the mystery genre attracted him to the project 
i have to admit i do like whodunits and roy marsden is an actor 
i had wanted to work with for a long time 
but he said he would have altered the tone of the show 
i dont think they make dalgliesh angry enough he said in 
an interview they dont want it dirty they dont want dalgliesh 
to be down market it is a very relaxed piece of tv 
its also a distinct contrast both in subject matter and style 
from the show to which he owes his success as hari kumar the 
britishreared indian wrongly charged with rape in the jewel in 
the crown malik impressed critics with his stirring portrait of 
a man caught in an affair he knows must end tragically 
i was lucky enough to be launched into the marketplace with 
the blessing of a series like jewel the actor recalled of the 
show which also brought such actors as tim pigottsmith geraldine 
james and charles dance to world attention 
in essence it allows you to be seen as a serious actor on 
television and those opportunities are rare 
he spoke less flatteringly of some of his other credits such as 
the abc tvmovie harem which aired in february 1986 in the 
united states 
the less said of that the better malik said of the 
fourhour show starring omar sharif and ava gardner in which he was 
cast as a turkish rebel the disaster of the whole piece was 
nobody could decide whether to be tongueincheek or serious 
however he said americans had no exclusive hold on mediocre 
television 
we have crap tv over here as well we have lousy movies as 
well malik said jewel comes out and then theres a 
hiatus 
he expressed high hopes for his upcoming project an abc drama 
series tentatively called the clinic costarring josef sommer 
michael learned and alexis smith and written by jay presson allen 
i have a lot of time for jay shes a lady with a lot of 
integrity malik said of allen a prolific and much admired 
writer who has created numerous works including the stage play and 
film the prime of miss jean brodie 
malik portrays ved lahari an indiaborn englandeducated 
psychiatrist who lives in boston the series is scheduled to debut 
in the summer 
the actor who lives in londons suburban surrey with his wife 
actress gina rowe and two daughters said he looks forward to the 
day when he is considered for all parts regardless of skin color 
two of his more prominent roles were as indians in the far 
pavilions and a passage to india 
every actor is a minority of one whether he be fat thin 
chinese a woman malik said i dont want to be seen as that 
im a working actor i want to be the modernday angloasian

the irreverent cheech marin whose comic 
born in east la movie is about to open here isnt worried 
that mexicans might not get the joke 
it feels real good he said i think this is the place 
where it will be the biggest hit of all the latin american 
countries including los angeles 
i expect people will see it and identify with it i expect 
they will laugh a lot and be moved a lot 
the idea started as a song parody of bruce springsteens born 
in the usa monster hit then grew into a popular video before 
becoming the movie written by directed by and starring marin 
i couldnt afford to pay anyone else he joked 
the story is of a thirdgeneration mexicanamerican caught up in 
an immigration dragnet and deported to mexico where marin says he 
is a fish out of water who must sneak back across the border 
much of the movie was filmed in tijuana mexicos northwestern city 
on the border with california 
born in east la earned generally good reviews and decent 
box office results in its release last year in the united states 
perhaps more important as far as marin is concerned it 
established his reputation for working alone without longtime 
partner tommy chong in the cheech and chong comic duo 
asked if the split is definite marin replied only for the 
next 150 years 
the movie will be released in mexican theaters in the second 
half of may under the spanish title un picaro de los angeles 
or a rascal from los angeles the subtitle is the craziest of 
them all 
just as the character in his movie marin is a thirdgeneration 
mexicanamerican he has learned spanish in the past few years in 
his travels but still has an interpreter standing by for his 
appearances here 
at least i dont say i used to want a beer right now he 
said of his progress i like it its a beautiful language 
he said there is nothing derogatory at all about mexico or about 
the immigration problem in the movie 
you realize the sadness within the situation he said in an 
interview i didnt come to tijuana to make fun of people 
its more learning about the people who cross the border i 
wanted to humanize the whole story so theyre not just numbers 
the united states needs the labor but they persecute the people 
its unjust 
mexicans have a notoriously thinskinned view of foreign humor 
about them and that easily could be true for jokes coming from 
mexicanamericans as well 
marin said the only screening so far in mexico was at a 
guadalajara festival and it went over well 
he also said the movie was a hit at the latin american film 
festival in havana late last year and has been shown as well in 
venezuela the dominican republic and parts of central america 
so if its not a big hit in mexico theres something wrong 
with mexico he said with a big laugh 
the movie was released at about the same time as the huge 
success of luis valdezs la bamba brought attention to the 
hispanic market in the united states stand and deliver the 
new movie starring edward james olmos about a mathematics teacher 
in a largely mexicanamerican los angeles high school also is a 
smash 
theyre hits and there will be more marin said its 
time all the people have put in their dues 
when the milagro beanfield war is mentioned however he 
replied i dont really consider that hispanic unless robert 
redford had mexican parents we dont know about it 
cheech and chong built much of their career on drug humor but 
marin says that topic is behind him 
we were only allotted 10000 drug jokes and they were 
gone he said 
he also said the innocent era has passed as well comparing the 
old jokes about three hippies passing a joint to the modern reality 
of a 14yearold selling crack armed with a uzi 
marin said about two years ago he split with chong got a 
divorce and found himself deeply in debt 
so i hit the typewriter he said thats always been my 
salvation

banned for 23 years as an extravagance 
beauty pageants are suddenly the rage in taiwan despite protests 
from feminists and oldguard conservatives 
the government lifted the ban in october and the countrys 
calendar already is crammed with two national and two international 
beauty contests culminating with the glitzy 1988 miss universe 
pageant on may 24 in taipei 
most taiwanese appear to favor the governments decision to end 
the ban one high school went so far as to hold its own pageant to 
select teenage students to compete in the 1988 miss republic of 
china competition april 16 
others are less enthusiastic however a small group of retired 
soldiers arguing that only ones mother can be considered the most 
beautiful woman have threatened to set themselves ablaze at the 
miss universe contest unless authorities reimpose the ban 
we know beauty pageants are controversial but we also know 
most people enjoy a diversified life that includes such pageants 
said tsai hanhsien an interior ministry official who supervises 
the contests 
but tseng hsupai a 93yearold adviser to president lee 
tenghui wants the pageants banned once again on grounds that they 
are luring women into abandoning work and study for the pursuit 
of fame and money 
beauty contests were banned in 1964 by a government that found 
them an unneeded extravagance when taiwan wasnt as wealthy as it 
is now 
early pageants were derided as indulgences by top officials who 
were closely tied to the contestants for example the 1961 winner 
wang liling was married to the son of taiwans governor at the 
time chou chijou 
prudishness also may have been a factor in the ban according to 
an interior ministry document leading military officials thought 
the winner of an early miss china pageant became a strip dancer in 
las vegas and urged thenpresident chiang kaishek to ban further 
contests 
but with onset of prosperity public opinion surveys indicate 
that most taiwanese welcome the return of beauty contests and hope 
the two international pageants to be held in taipei miss universe 
and miss wonderland on april 29 will help the island win new 
friends 
nearly 1000 women overwhelmed two local pageants leading to the 
international contests but not without controversy 
after a televised preliminary round to chose taiwans 
representative for the miss wonderland contest several people 
telephoned to complain of contestants wearing swimsuits with 
plunging necklines 
about 25 feminists demonstrated outside the hotel where the 
finals were held april 1 and they hoisted signs that read women 
are not commercial products the group argued that pageants judge 
women by their figures and not by traditional standards of chinese 
beauty such as intelligence and elegance 
four retired soldiers also showed up outside the hotel to 
distribute antipageant fliers 
beauty contests are insults to mothers said one hsu 
chengchien nobody in the world is more beautiful than ones 
mother 
hsu told reporters he and 10 other veterans will immolate 
themselves if the government does not ban the pageants 
the second national contest was held april 16 to select taiwans 
contestants for the miss universe miss international and miss 
world pageants 
two contestants dropped out because their parents thought it 
shameful to wear swimsuits in public 
one of the three winners 18yearold wu yining was sent to 
the pageant with four classmates by the chuang ching high schools 
board of directors and faculty the school held its own beauty 
contest to select them and then provided wardrobes and intensive 
model training 
miss wu told a news conference after winning that she would 
leave school for a year to meet her responsibilities as a winner 
despite the controversies pageant organizer shieh tungmin 
maintains that taiwan cannot ignore that pageants will help 
foreign countries better understand the prosperity and success of 
our country 
not so responded huang kuangkuo professor of psychology at 
the national taiwan university who is quick to say pageants are 
not the apex of cultural activity 
the world may get to know taiwans name from pageants but 
pageants have nothing to do with raising the nations profile he 
said

the case of tawana brawley has become a festering social 
wound 
the new york times in a march 15 editorial 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
what really happened to tawana 
brawley 
her advisers have promised shell spill all by weeks end 
either to a federal prosecutor of their liking or to reporters 
the story will be told vowed the rev al sharpton the 
brooklyn minister who appointed himself brawleys protector and 
keeper of her silence 
the public will not see this end without ever knowing tawanas 
story we owe that to the people who have supported her sharpton 
said in an interview 
only scattered pieces of an unsolved puzzle have emerged in the 
five months since the former cheerleader stepped off a bus into the 
evening shadows and what she said was an abduction punctuated by 
sexual and racial abuse 
brawley then 15 was found dazed and wriggling in a garbage bag 
outside her old apartment nov 28 four days after she disappeared 
her hair was chopped her skin smeared with dog feces and the 
words nigger and kkk were scrawled on her torso 
according to relatives and her sketchy accounts to police she 
was raped sodomized and abused by three to six white men one of 
whom she alleged was a policeman with blond hair and a mustache 
hospital tests however showed no signs of sexual abuse 
brawleys refusal to tell her story to a state grand jury has 
brought suspicion innuendo doubt gossip questions about a cops 
suicide and the sizzle of racial tension to this working class 
village in the hudson river valley 
bewildered investigators handcuffed by brawleys reticence are 
nowhere near making an arrest 
that silence ultimately might jeopardize and prejudice the 
opportunity to bring charges against anybody its been 
perplexing said state attorney general robert abrams 
supervising eight investigators and 12 prosecutors on the case 
abrams hinted the grand jury would look at possible obstruction 
of justice by sharpton and brawleys lawyers c vernon mason and 
alton maddox militant activists known for raising the voltage in 
racially charged cases 
there will be all facts taken into account including the 
behavior of the lawyers abrams told cbs radio 
i challenge him to arrest us and prove in court that were 
obstructing justice sharpton retorted later in the interview 
he should quit bluffing 
brawleys advisers have led marches through wappingers falls 
made charges at news conferences and postured before cameras this 
legal and media circus around the case has also had its sideshows 
entertainer bill cosby and edward lewis publisher of essence 
magazine offered a 25000 reward to find the truth 
heavyweight boxing champion mike tyson and promoter don king 
spent six hours with brawley on feb 13 tyson gave her his 
30000 diamondstudded rolex watch he and king pledged 50000 
apiece to pay her college tuition 
but the truth is unknown and no place is more eager for the 
truth than wappingers falls a village of 5000 whites and 100 
blacks 70 miles north of new york city 
townspeople are doubly weary of the reporters who come to glue 
together shreds of an account that has given headline writers for 
new york tabloids a workout and of waiting to hear the truth 
the best thing would be for this bimbo to open her mouth and 
tell what happened or drop the whole thing said carlos 
rosewhite 42 a substitute teacher a lifelong resident and a 
black people are getting sick of it we want to know what 
happened and who did it all were getting is secondhand 
information 
rosewhite also challenged the girls allegation of racial 
motives saying my sister asked me how come shes walked this 
town for 40 years and the klan waited for tawana brawley 
for now the case has more questions than answers 
on nov 24 brawley skipped classes at rc ketcham high school 
to visit a former boyfriend in jail 13 miles away she rode the 
bus back and was last seen about 845 pm at a bus stop a mile 
from her home 
four days later former neighbors saw her crawling into the 
garbage bag on the ground outside her familys recently vacated 
apartment where her mother had just checked for unforwarded mail 
her clothing was different from when she vanished and her 
soiled denim jacket was in an idle washing machine in the building 
lt bill mccord of the wappingers falls police said her mother 
glenda first reported the girl missing at 202 pm saturday 17 
minutes after she was found 
brawley gave police the barest scraps of information writing 
brief notes accompanied by grunts and nods she said she was 
abducted by two white men in a dark car one with blond hair and a 
light mustache who flashed a policetype badge and wore a holster 
brawley said she was driven to a wooded area where more white 
men waited to rape and sodomize her one urinated in her mouth she 
said she remembered few other details 
at a hospital a black policeman asked who did it brawley 
pointed to his badge and scrawled on a pad white cop 
last month the new york daily news reported how 18 months ago 
a classmate of brawleys told a similar tale of being abducted and 
assaulted by two men in a dark car poughkeepsie police found she 
concocted the story to conceal abuse by a family member 
a friend said brawley had recently angered her stepfather ralph 
king by staying out late after a party king 40 a bus driver 
known around town for a quick temper spent seven years in prison 
for fatally shooting his first wife 
tom croshier bartender at otooles said patrons question 
brawleys account because of the familys known domestic problems 
the general feeling is its a family affair croshier said 
meanwhile the investigation has had its fits and starts 
william grady the dutchess county district attorney quit the 
case because one of his assistants steven pagones was a friend of 
harry crist jr a parttime cop in fishkill who killed himself 
dec 2 
crist 28 who lived four blocks from brawley fit the girls 
description of a fairhaired man with a mustache he said in his 
suicide note he was jilted by his girlfriend and failed to get a 
job as a state trooper 
investigators drew no link to the brawley case but brawleys 
advisers accused crist and pagones of being assailants pagones has 
threatened them with a slander suit 
a special prosecutor also quit after one day the state attorney 
general took over jan 26 
brawleys advisers have challenged every official effort to 
investigate the case 
they balked at cooperating because they thought john ryan an 
abrams aide wasnt sensitive enough in civil rights matters then 
they insisted that abrams handle the trial even though he had 
little courtroom experience 
if sharpton cant get an impartial state prosecutor he wants 
us attorney rudolph giuliani to take over 
they simply dont wish to cooperate said gov mario cuomo 
the governor also warned the trail is getting cold

the rev al sharpton the bombastic pentecostal 
minister with the james brown hairdo and gift for gab climbed atop 
the soap box long before he found the tawana brawley case 
ive been screaming ever since the doctor slapped me at 
birth said sharpton 33 a parishless preacher from brooklyn who 
wears a martin luther king jr medallion on a chain around his 
beefy neck 
silence is not one of my characteristics sharpton said 
anytime somebody tells me i get a lot of attention on my causes 
thats a compliment an activist is supposed to get attention what 
am i supposed to be an activist that kills the limelight on an 
issue 
reports however suggest sharpton mouths off to more than just 
the news media 
in january newsday reported sharpton gave information on black 
leaders elected officials organized crime figures and others to 
the fbi sharpton was also allegedly under investigation for 
scalping rock concert tickets earmarked for ghetto youth but has 
denied any wrongdoing 
all that was a whole lot of talk thats all theres no grand 
jury we gave some drug information sharpton said 
sharpton has directed antidrug rallies and took to the new york 
subways in december and january to lead the days of outrage 
protests against racial injustice in the city 
he screeched about racism in howard beach where three white 
teenagers were convicted of manslaughter last year in the death of 
a black man they chased onto a highway 
now he is advising the 16yearold brawley who he says was 
abducted raped and sodomized by a group of white men in a small 
town 70 miles north of new york city racial epithets were written 
on her body 
on sharptons advice she has refused to tell her story beyond a 
fragmented almost incoherent interview with police the day she was 
found 
state assemblyman roger green chairman of the black and puerto 
rican legislative caucus has accused sharpton of using tactics 
that encourage race wars 
the rev carl fleminster executive director of the american 
baptist churches of metropolitan new york said it was a travesty 
sharpton and his friends had refused to let this investigation 
proceed except on their own terms 
but sharpton says he wants to focus on what he calls a pattern 
of police and racial abuses 
enough is enough were going to break it on this case 
sharpton said 
at age 4 sharpton gave his first sermon a 22minute piece at a 
church in the bedfordstuyvesant section of brooklyn he was 
licensed to minister at age 10 and appeared with gospel singer 
mahalia jackson when he was 16 
as a 12yearold he met adam clayton powell the late 
congressman and head of harlems abyssinian baptist church you 
know kid you got to know when to hit it and know when to quit 
it sharpton said powell told him 
in 1969 sharpton worked with jesse jackson on boycotts of food 
stores under operation breadbasket he says jackson told him 
turn on the heat and dont ever turn it off 
in 1972 sharpton met james brown the selfproclaimed godfather 
of soul music sharpton toured with brown and reverently copied his 
wavy hairdo 
i thought i had seen god when i met adam clayton powell when 
i saw james i knew i had seen god james is everything i would 
think god would be if he was walking around sharpton said in an 
interview with the associated press 
through brown sharpton met boxing promoter don king at the 
muhammad aligeorge foreman title fight in zaire in 1974 
king tried to give a check to brown who insisted on cash king 
relented and delivered 100000 
we counted it out on the floor sharpton said

the utne reader warned of the coming 
crash months before the stock market nosedive it foresaw a wave 
of activism washing the country weeks before americans took to the 
streets to protest us troops in honduras 
with a flair for prophecy and a circulation approaching 90000 
more than double the figure of a year ago eric utnes 4yearold 
digest of the underground and alternative press aims to chronicle 
the intellectual voice of the baby boom generation 
its my hope and suspicion that the 90s are going to be far 
different from the 80s and that people are going to start thinking 
about social and political issues in a different way said 
executive editor jay walljasper 32 
i think well be right there helping to define and propel that 
thinking its my hope well have our finger on the pulse the way 
rolling stone did in the 1960s and 70s 
thats modest compared to utnes designs 
i want to change the world said the magazines 41yearold 
namesake and founder thats why i started it thats the 
motivation i want to find out in the process how the world should 
be i dont have a clear agenda i think there are a lot of voices 
to be heard 
utne walljasper and associate editor helen cordes scan the 
vast largely leftofcenter landscape of the alternative press and 
excerpt the best they see in their bimonthly editions the reader 
sells for 4 an issue 
the editors say theyve combed nearly 3000 magazine titles in 
search of material the journals are stacked high in the readers 
office above a gourmet coffee shop 
scanned along with familiar opinion magazines such as the nation 
and american spectator are obscure journals like the indiabased 
manushi printed alternately in english and hindi the 
londonbased new ground the selfbilled journal of green 
socialism and daybreak a national magazine by and about 
american indians 
for some magazines to be excerpted by the utne reader is to 
have their whispers amplified to shouts many journals and writers 
send their published articles to the reader walljasper said 
in turn he said editors and fans look to the reader as their 
line to the alternative press walljasper calls the hundreds of 
special interest ofteneccentric periodicals the intellectual 
equivalent of the network of radar stations set up on the nations 
perimeter to monitor incoming aircraft 
it brings a lot to the attention of people who otherwise 
wouldnt get that information said richard reynolds 
communications director of the san franciscobased mother jones 
magazine 
a person couldnt subscribe to all those magazines excerpted 
unless theyre a fanatic i like the utne reader reynolds said 
added dan cohen cultural editor of the new york newsweekly the 
guardian its sort of a readers digest of progressive writing 
im glad its out there 
the readers digest comparisons are inevitable the two share 
the excerpting format coincidentally both were conceived in the 
twin cities though the late dewitt wallace moved his digest from 
minnesota long ago 
but readers digest in the middle of the mainstream has little 
interest in the kind of articles found on utnes pages 
recent reader cover stories include in search of meaningful 
ritual on finding customs and ceremonies that reflect your 
values and in praise of idleness how to live well outside 
the fast lane 
conservative and liberal views are often juxtaposed in the 
reader which flanks main pieces with numerous shorter related 
stories walljasper says the reader doesnt preach to the 
converted the way some publications do 
nevertheless utnes interests and philosophy come through 
loudly 
new age and holistic references abound utne not 
coincidentally founded new age journal 14 years ago in his first 
magazine venture it lives on without him printing articles on 
natural foods ecological politics and eastern spirituality 
utne a participant in the 1960s counterculture during his time 
at the university of minnesota has worked as a literary agent in 
boston and as director of new ventures for wilson learning corp in 
eden prairie he describes his politics vaguely saying he yearns 
for a greener kinder world 
advertising for a managing editor in the first year utne listed 
attributes that more or less match his own a slightly skeptical 
exradical hippie spiritualtype magazine addict whos seen all 
the movements for personal growth and social change and still has 
hope for the future 
his original hope for the magazine has been met and then some 
utne says the idea was sprung by a directmail test that persuaded 
eight investors to put up the 150000 in seed money he has not 
had to go back for more 
from the premier issue a 12page newsletter issued in february 
1984 the utne reader has grown to 128 pages in the mayjune 1988 
issue in a special report to readers in the latest edition utne 
reports a secure positive cash flow that has brought the 
reader to the breakeven point 
he states plans to begin alternative press awards and to form a 
business and professional association committed to social 
responsibility 
the utne reader doesnt have to be small and struggling just 
because its committed to small oftenstruggling publications 
utne said readers digest he noted didnt have a huge baby boom 
audience to nurture its growth the way the reader has 
and theyre selling 18 million an issue i figure why 
shouldnt we go just as big in this day and age of media overload 
something that does the selecting and integrating job for readers 
is really a useful service

vernon tejas awoke uneasily in the 
darkness of his snow cave high on mount mckinley it was his 20th 
day climbing the continents highest peak and he was the only 
living soul for miles 
but now someone or something seemed to be in the cave with him 
it could have been just the wind the 35yearold alaskan 
recalled but i was pretty convinced right then and there that 
naomi was in there with me 
on feb 12 1984 naomi uemura became the first mountaineer to 
scale mount mckinley alone in winter he vanished in a storm on the 
way down and some veteran climbers believe the japanese explorers 
spirit still roams the mountain 
tejas called out good morning in japanese the roaring wind 
outside gave the only reply and tejas settled back convinced the 
spirit was benign 
the wind eased the next day march 7 and tejas climbed to the 
summit where he planted a japanese flag to honor the man who 
blazed the way for him then he did something uemura failed to do 
he came back 
mount mckinley elevation 20320 feet is considered north 
americas ultimate mountaineering challenge the vertical reach 
from base camp on the kahiltna glacier to the summit is 13200 feet 
about 2000 feet greater than the climb up mount everest 
each may and june hundreds of climbers flock to mckinley 
unbearable arctic weather forces more than half to turn back short 
of the summit 
in winter the unbearable turns unbelievable temperatures can 
dip to minus 58 degrees and storms rake the mountain with 
hurricaneforce winds 
only four teams have made it to the top in winter since the 
first expedition in 1967 two of them lost climbers uemura was one 
of two climbers to die in a recent flurry of solo winter attempts 
in all mckinleys slopes are littered with the memories of more 
than 50 dead climbers 
tejas knows all the grim mileposts crevassed areas named for 
climbers they swallowed a slope dubbed the autobahn for the many 
germans who have fallen there and he uses them as warning signs 
i want to challenge myself to live as fully and completely as 
possible he said a lot of people will say youre doing 
something that jeopardizes your ability to live but by living on 
the edge i can define life a lot easier it doesnt make you love 
it any less it makes you love it more 
tejas returned as something of a local hero as he sat recently 
in a sunlit anchorage cafe strangers kept interrupting to 
congratulate him 
they stopped partly because of his accomplishment partly 
because tejas is hard to miss his head at its lower elevations 
is forested by a bushy black beard the summit is bare shaved 
daily except for a neatly braided rattail 
tejas pronounced tayhoss stands 5foot8 and has a 
personality that lives up to his hairstyle a veteran of 13 
successful mckinley climbs most of them as a guide for genet 
expeditions he bounces boisterous yodels off the bergschrund and 
readily pulls a fiddle from his pack to scratch out folk tunes 
he came to alaska in 1973 a flatlander from houston within 
three days he stood slackjawed in denali national park watching 
as clouds unveiled mckinleys towering north face tejas fell in 
love 
he worked construction jobs and lived in a tent to save money 
to get into climbing big time he first climbed mckinley in 
1978 the next year he was invited back to guide 
in 1986 he led the first successful winter climb of canadas 
mount logan north americas secondtallest peak two months later 
back on mckinley he took part in a daring rescue climbing over 
the summit ridge and rappelling 600 feet to reach two altitudesick 
korean climbers 
national park service rangers discourage solo climbs of mckinley 
and tried to dissuade another climber who started up the same day 
as tejas that climber with no previous arctic experience was 
flown out with frostbitten toes after five days 
tejas was not warned 
i think vern is a very special case said ralph moore a 
mountaineering ranger who lauds tejas as a cautious climber and a 
meticulous planner with vern it was a very calculated risk he 
knew what he was getting into 
tejas proudly notes he can still count to 20 on his fingers and 
toes each digit intact and unfrozen to prevent slips into 
crevasses on his solo climb he strapped a 16foot extension ladder 
to his body my aluminum albatross he calls it 
tejas was flown to mckinley on feb 16 by glacier pilot lowell 
thomas jr he carried 170 pounds of gear and enough food for 16 
days but as he packed a toboggan he decided he had too much he 
left behind his tent and 20 pounds of food

he never missed the tent each night he dug a trench then 
covered it with a roof of snow supported by his skis ladder and 
other gear as the temperature outside dipped to 20 degrees below 
zero the air inside stayed a comfortable 20 to 30 degrees above 
good thing tejas was confined to trenches or to snow caves dug 
by previous expeditions for 16 of his 29 days on the mountain he 
hid in them from raging storms eating half rations to conserve 
food stuffing in earplugs to sleep while the wind roared like a 
locomotive 
tejas used precious hours between storms to inch upward 
sometimes he tossed bamboo wands ahead to gauge the slope in a 
white landscape made featureless by blowing snow he reached the 
top in a whiteout on the 21st day 
i put a japanese flag on the summit out of respect for 
naomis spirit took a few pictures and got the heck out of 
there he said 
tejas picked his way down the mountain finally reaching base 
camp on the 27th day he dug in and waited two days later on 
march 16 the clouds lifted and tejas was flown the 130 miles south 
to anchorage where he stepped into a circle of reporters and the 
arms of his girlfriend gail irvine 
tejas said his month on the mountain reinforced his conviction 
that people are not solitary creatures at heart it deepened his 
relationship with irvine and stirred thoughts of his father to 
whom he hadnt spoken for 19 years 
the first thing i wanted to do when i got back was call him 
and tell him i love him tejas said unfortunately he was out 
of town but he called me hed heard about the climb 
tejas seems to have returned from a month of risking death even 
fuller of life 
if you take on a challenge that is bigger than you and you 
overcome the obstacles in the way you become a bigger person for 
it he said you find your own limitations but you also find 
your true ability in the process 
tejas is still exploring his limitations earlier this month he 
led a climb in eastern alaskas wrangell mountains and hes 
scheduled to lead two groups up mckinley in may 
tejas had hoped to make last months climb even more historic by 
being the first to descend from mckinleys summit hanging from a 
parasail 
the swirling snow foiled that plan but the parasail is cached 
near the summit with a wide grin tejas said he just might be able 
to find it

though the tallis scholars seldom sing anything 
more recent than the 17th century peter phillips doesnt consider 
the group to be part of the early music revival 
nor does the young conductor worry very much whether the 
scholars mimic the sound of the renaissance 
we cant possibly guess and we cant possibly know he said 
during the british groups recent us tour its not like 
digging up an instrument which has been buried and reanimating 
it 
the standard of authenticity for phillips boils down to what 
sounds good i hope that is based on how the choirs were 
constituted and how it did sound in the 16th century he added 
the scholars are now the busiest exponents of sacred music of 
the renaissance and are doing well enough to sustain their own 
label gimell 
tallis scholars recordings have a heavily english flavor with 
two by thomas tallis two more featuring the music of william byrd 
and the missa gloria tibi trinitas of john taverner 
there is also a single recording of music by the contemporary 
composer john tavener who was commissioned by the scholars 
however the groups best seller has been its recording of two 
masses by josquin desprez a flemish composer who died in 1521 the 
performance was honored as record of the year for 1987 by 
grammophone magazine 
debates about the performance of ancient music are often heated 
and at times extreme phillips said he has heard it categorically 
stated that the music of palestrina was meant to be sung one voice 
to a part and that the music of lassus ideally should have 12 
voices per part though the two men were contemporaries writing in 
similar styles 
experts tend to have their hobbyhorses i find phillips 
said i cant afford to get bogged down with these endless 
details and not see my way through to a good performance 
in the end i am most interested in preserving this beauty of 
sound and i will not let dogmatic authenticity get in the way 
the voice he wants phillips says is one which can sustain a 
contrapuntal line without distorting the texture and that requires 
singing in tune and without very much vibrato 
the group which toured this country included two basses two 
tenors two countertenors male altos and four women sopranos the 
use of women rather than boy sopranos is phillips most obvious 
departure from the practice of the 16th century 
phillips argues that authentic boy sopranos are no longer 
available because boys voices now break at age 12 or 13 in the 
16th century voices broke in the late teens so the boy soprano of 
the time would have a riper voice and greater maturity as a 
musician 
furthermore phillips said it is likely that women were used in 
some renaissance music such as byrds later works for the private 
chapels of roman catholic families whether that music was for one 
voice or two voices per part phillips said was very much a 
question of how many people turned up for service 
phillips 35 was never a choirboy my parents did not think 
of it they arent musical but he became interested in 
renaissance music as an undergraduate at winchester college he won 
an organ scholarship at st johns college oxford where he claims 
to have been a very indifferent performer 
in the early 1970s he came under the spell of david wulstans 
choral group the clerkes of oxenford which was founded in the 
1960s and used women the tallis scholars were found in 1973 and 
became a fully professional group in 1978 
the scholars are the only group recorded by gimell the 
oxfordbased label which phillips founded in partnership with steve 
c smith after cutting two records for emi 
it was obvious they werent particularly interested 
phillips said they wanted a moneyspinner 
with his own label phillips has been able to record the music 
of composers such as clemens non papa who is obscure even within 
the small world of early music gimell will soon release what is 
apparently the first recording of music of sarum chant the 
liturgical music of medieval england

fraud confusion and for thousands new rejection 
have dogged the us immigration amnesty program in florida 
particularly for haitian aliens who have for years charged unfair 
treatment by the federal government 
theres a general perception that they get treated differently 
from the other groups said attorney douglas lux director of a 
lutheran ministries program that helps aliens in miamis little 
haiti neighborhood these are simple people they dont know 
who to trust but they are hungry to be us citizens 
he had just spent 30 minutes explaining to an upset young woman 
with her male friend translating into creole why the immigration 
and naturalization service had rejected her application for 
amnesty he asked who had prepared her application and was told a 
notary public 
lux rolled his eyes 
these notaries public just take their money and they dont 
know what theyre doing he said then explained to the woman 
that she could appeal and file a new application with more 
documentation 
lack of documentation has been a major problem for the aliens 
many of them poorly educated most have been living underground 
using aliases and trying to avoid the ins 
the selling and presentation of false documents has been more 
prevalent in florida than any other state the ins says some 20 
percent of the nearly 100000 applications filed in florida were 
recommended for denial district director perry rivkind said 
nationwide about 95 percent have been approved 
the biggest problem has been with farmworkers who rarely have 
payroll records because they are paid in cash at the programs 
beginning farm contractors sold false payroll records with prices 
reportedly ranging from 25 to 2500 
the us attorneys office said last week it would discontinue 
operation cucumber which resulted in 61 fraud indictments against 
farmworkers and employers but was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 
courts 
while nonfarmworker aliens must provide documents proving they 
have lived continuously in the united states since before jan 1 
1982 the requirements for farmworkers were much looser to ensure a

more than 40000 haitians have been granted residency in that class 
but haitians applying under the amnesty program sometimes dont 
understand or cant obtain the required proof of residency and 
employment 
i understand their feelings rivkind said but i dont 
know how you can approve anything without some proof weve got to 
abide by the law which has certain requirements 
the haitian american community association of dade county and 
the haitian refugee center inc have stopped helping with new 
applications lux said such organizations along with the lutheran 
ministries and the american friends service committee are barely 
keeping up with applications and lack the resources to handle 
appeals 
the haitian advocates say the ins processors have become overly 
skeptical because of the fraud cases 
there are some crooks but we shouldnt penalize the majority 
because of a minority said gerard jeanjuste head of the 
haitian refugee center its a lot of headaches to the us

you really dont need to know much about 
investing to make a buck in the market these days 
not that its easy you do need a few hundred million dollars 
quick access to information a good computer program and a 
willingness to push the buy or sell button given all that you 
have a chance at another fortune 
your activities have almost nothing to do with understanding the 
companies whose shares you buy or sell or of assessing their 
fundamental values or measuring their management or determining if 
they can remain competitive 
your purpose as a program trader is not so much to invest in the 
potential earnings of corporations as it is to use the marketplace 
as a tool while you need not understand companies you must 
understand how to work the market 
your focus is not just shortterm in the usual sense of the 
word which might mean a few months but briefterm in the sense 
that you deal with tiny price variations that might come and go in 
a matter of minutes 
some critics say the various program trading techniques are but 
a step away from manipulation they say the public sensing this 
will stay away from stocks just as reasonable humans and animals 
stay clear of the elephant herd 
in recent days donald regan former head of merrill lynch said 
such actdivities should be outlawed and former attorney general 
nicholas katzenbach suggested the public may come to view the 
market as controlled rather than free 
congress is upset much of wall street is also disturbed and 
the new york stock exchange has won approval from the securities 
and exchange commission to curtail program trading whenever the dow 
jones industrial average moves 50 points in a day 
much of the concern relates to extreme volatility that critics 
attribute to program trading which often kicks in automatically 
when certain criteria are reached thus exacerbating what otherwise 
might be minor price changes 
program trading was among practices cited in the collapse of 
oct 19 and in the 100pointplus selloff in a few hours last week 
not only is it associated with big moves rightly or wrongly but 
with reversals as well 
institutions with computers trading power information and 
programs can make quick money on volatility but volatility 
contradicts one of the basic promises of organized marketplaces 
that is an orderly flow of transactions 
a loss of confidence in organized markets is deadly reduce 
confidence and you reduce participation reduce participation and 
it means smaller commissions and maybe lower prices too 
evidence of lowered confidence abounds today measured by such 
things as unstable prices money left on the sidelines rather than 
committed to stocks and shrunken priceearnings ratios 
wright investors service points out that the priceearnings 
multiple the number of times earnings at which stocks sell is 
now down to about 13 times 1988 earnings for the standard amp poors 
500stock index last summer it was 20 
this and other evidence undoubtedly was considered by the 
securities and exchange commission when it cited the fragile 
nature of public confidence in approving the big boards 
limitations on program trading

ppg industries inc said thursday strong 
performances in its chemicals and fiber glass businesses and 
favorable currency exchange rates helped firstquarter earnings 
rise 365 percent from the same period last year 
net earnings were 1186 million or 107 per share on sales 
of 137 billion compared to 869 million or 73 cents per share 
on 126 billion in sales a year earlier 
one result of our strategic emphasis on globalization and 
valueadded diversification is that lower north american auto 
production and housing starts did not impede ppgs ability to 
achieve substantial growth chairman vincent a sarni said 
ppg said its glass business benefitted from strong gains in the 
european auto and construction markets and worldwide demand for 
continuous strand fiber glass 
sales of new car coatings rose significantly in europe and 
canada and chemicals sales were considerably higher although ppg 
divested units that had 1987 firstquarter sales of 37 million

home diaper delivery service is bottoming 
out in philadelphia in what some industry watchers say is another 
sign of the nationwide hard times facing an oldfashioned product 
damaged by the growth of disposable diapers dydee diaper 
service of westmont nj dropped its homedelivery service early 
this month after almost 50 years and has laid off about 20 percent 
of its workforce 
dydees longtime competitor dydee service of philadelphia 
absorbed a few hundred customers saw its local sales rise by 14 
percent and is not hurting at all says general manager jake 
pilkington 
but 12 other such services have dried up locally over the past 
20 years 
nationally the numbers have dropped by more than half to about 
200 during that time according to john a shiffert executive 
director of the philadelphiabased national association of diaper 
services 
industry analysts estimate that disposables now account for up 
to 90 percent of all diapers used although shiffert puts the 
figure at 60 percent to 70 percent he also contends that as many 
babies up to 800000 nationwide wear delivered cloth diapers as 
they did 20 years ago 
shiffert and odd knutstad manager of the westmont company 
blame the intense 20year advertising campaign by disposable 
diaper manufacturers for the demise of home delivery 
by the time the baby is born the woman has seen the ad 
hundreds and hundreds of times for pampers and is seduced by them 
her husband also knutstad said 
we sent them literature we called but most people said 
ive already made up my mind im going to take disposables like 
ive seen on tv 
diaper delivery services began declining drastically in the 
mid1960s when procter amp gamble co one of the first companies to 
manufacture disposable diapers stepped up its advertising 
nationwide shiffert said 
disposable diapers before then were looked upon as temporary 
things for travel he said 
as a result of the blitz many familyowned diaper businesses 
failed or were bought by larger companies shiffert said 
in 1987 combined sales of luvs and pampers brands amounted to 
nearly 16 percent of procter amp gambles 17 billion in revenue 
knutstad also blamed the growth of disposables on working 
mothers who have are not at home to receive solicitations from 
delivery services but peers in the business believe working 
mothers will be the factor that turns the industry around 
for example pilkington said twocareer couples want the 
convenience of a diaper service and can afford it disposables cost 
at least 11 a box a week while dydee service charges 1225 for 
90 diapers a week 
pilkington and shiffert also think mounting trash disposal 
problems will ultimately restrict the use of disposable products 
ecologicallyminded people already use diaper services they said 
dydee service in philadelphia predicts it will expand 
deliveries beyond its current 4000 households the company a 
division of general health care corp of piscataway nj operates 
18 growing diaperdelivery services nationwide pilkington said 
knutstad also foresees an improving market but said it will not 
develop soon enough for the westmont firm the company will 
concentrate on accounts with nursing homes and diversify its 
services for at least five years when it might again target homes

general motors corps earnings over the rest of 
1988 should improve from their firstquarter performance despite 
an expected slowing of auto sales in the united states industry 
analysts predict 
gms firstquarter earnings rose 184 percent against a year 
ago due primarily to an accounting change while its operating 
income fell 43 percent gm reported thursday 
the nations largest automaker said it earned 109 billion or 
311 a share on sales of 264 billion in the first quarter in 
firstquarter 1987 gm earned 9225 million or 262 a share on 
sales of 261 billion 
without the accounting change which boosted gm net income by 
2242 million firstquarter earnings would have been 59 percent 
lower than a year earlier at 868 million or 241 a share 
the automakers operating earnings fell 43 percent to 6576 
million in the first quarter from 6874 million a year ago the 
result of production cutbacks the costs of buyer incentives and 
increased labor costs gm said 
gms worldwide vehicle sales were down 52 percent from 
firstquarter 1987 us sales account for about 61 percent of gms 
worldwide vehicle sales 
us sales of americanmade cars and trucks to dealers fell 
nearly 16 percent against the first three months of 1987 as dealers 
balanced their inventories but on the retail side dealers sales 
of gm vehicles including imports rose 12 percent on cars against a 
year ago and 24 percent on trucks 
david healy industry analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc 
in new york predicted gms sales and earnings would improve in 
later quarters due to boosts in vehicle production and to the 
firstquarter cleanout of dealer inventories 
theyre scheduling a lot more production of cars and trucks in 
the second quarter so they could earn even twice as much as in the 
first quarter if the onetime accounting change is excluded 
healy said 
chris cedergren an analyst with jd power and associates in 
agoura hills calif said he expected us auto sales to slow in 
the second quarter delaying improvement in gm earnings until later 
in the year 
but gms earnings will benefit from further cost cuts in the 
second quarter cedergren said 
gm would not provide figures for earnings or losses on gms us 
automaking business gm earned only a nominal profit on its us 
vehicle business for all of 1987 
on wednesday gm had reported earnings rose for two of its 
subsidiaries gm hughes electronics corp and electronic data 
systems corp but fell for its finance subsidiary general motors 
acceptance corp because of cutrate loans to consumers and fewer 
auto sales 
gm said it made improvements in manufacturing efficiency and 
engineering but the gains were not enough to offset lower sales 
gmacs lower earnings and cost increases that included wage 
increases under a new labor contract 
were going to continue to cut costs and improve the 
efficiency of our plants and the quality of our products the 
company said in a statement attributed to gm chairman roger smith 
and gm president robert stempel 
in 1987 gm trimmed 37 billion from its costs under the first 
phase of a fouryear plan that calls for 4 billion in cost cuts in 
1988 gm said it cut 13 billion from its costs in firstquarter 
1988

jim p manzi the 36yearold chairman of lotus made 263 
million in salary bonuses and stock options during 1987 topping 
the 179 million taken home by iacocca who had been the toppaid 
executive of 1986 the magazine said thursday 
figures were compiled for the annual executive compensation 
scoreboard being published in business weeks may 2 edition 
the list which covers 339 companies shows that with longterm 
compensation the average chief executives total pay jumped 48 
percent in 1987 to 18 million one of the largest single 
increases ever

were exercised prior to the oct 19 market crash 
excluding longterm pay the average chief executives salary 
and bonus rose 8 percent to 975617 much less than the 18 percent 
average increase in 1986 and slightly below the 86 percent that 
most managers settled for the magazine said

running shoe company reebok international ltd who collected a 
total of 154 million 
two of the highestpaid bosses worked for the same company 
waste management inc no 4 president phillip b rooney collected 
143 million while no 6 donald f flynn senior vice president 
collected 132 million 
in a separate analysis of the relationship between pay and 
company performance over a threeyear period business week said 
the executives who delivered the most to shareholders were robert 
a swanson chairman of genentech inc and richard g cline 
chairman of nicor inc 
swanson was credited with giving shareholders of the innovative 
biotechnology company the largest return in stock appreciation and 
dividends for the least pay in the past three years cline was 
credited with earning the least relative to the profitability of 
his company a natural gas utility 
business week said the worst performers were iacocca and john f 
mcgillicuddy head of manufacturers hanover corp 
iacoccas pay was the highest relative to chryslers return to 
shareholders while mcgillicuddy earned the most measured against 
the banks weak financial performance due to hard hit by third

some bosses who lost their jobs were big winners because of 
socalled golden parachute severance awards they had negotiated

santa fe southern pacific corp says it net 
income soared in the first quarter but most of the gains were 
proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations the company said 
thursday 
the transportation and natural resources company reported net 
income of 343 million or 218 a share for the first three 
months of 1988 compared with 459 million or 29 cents a share 
for the same period a year ago 
excluding a gain of about 324 million from the sale of its 
california timber operations some of its pipelines and its leasing 
subsidiary santa fes net income for the quarter declined to 187 
million from 388 million 
revenue for the quarter totaled nearly 136 billion compared 
with 123 billion a year earlier 
the lower net result is no surprise as it reflects 
anticipated nonrecurring expenses of approximately 30 million 
incurred in connection with our restructuring program and a 57 
million increase in interest expense santa fe president robert 
d krebs stated 
the interest expense resulted from the companys borrowing of 
37 billion and issuing of 780 million in debt securities to make 
a 30ashare payment to stockholders as part of its restructuring 
plan krebs said 
operating income increased 57 percent to 1531 million the 
santa fe railway contributed 514 million in operating income and 
had its best quarterly results in recent history krebs said

koppers co says it no longer is considering 
selling the entire company as a defense against a 17 billion 
hostile takeover bid launched by brian beazer 
but talks are continuing with unidentified third parties about 
possibly selling parts of koppers chemicals and construction 
materials and services divisions according to a securities and 
exchange commission filing made availale on thursday 
koppers chairman charles r pullin said march 27 that 
discussions were being held with unidentified third parties about 
selling the entire company to keep it out of beazers hands 
a group led by beazer and the investment firm shearson lehman 
hutton inc is offering 60 per share for koppers 
in response beazer issued a letter he sent thursday to pullin 
saying koppers disclosure that it may sell only parts of its 
chemicals and construction divisions is a radical departure for 
the company 
beazer said that koppers previously said it would not consider

gains in orders for big ticket durable goods in march were 
offset by a drop in orders for military hardware leaving the 
overall balance virtually unchanged the government said today 
total orders for durable goods items expected to last three or 
more years amounted to a seasonally adjusted 1143 billion last 
month the commerce department said 
that was a tiny 53 million rise and followed a slight 01 
percent increase in february and a sharp 12 percent drop in 
january 
while economists had been expecting a substantial increase in 
march orders the february number represented a sharp upward 
revision from a previous estimate of a 11 percent drop 
the report came as interest rates in bond market continued to 
rise amid concerns that inflation is heating up again 
the yield of the treasurys benchmark 30year treasury bond rose 
to 903 percent by late thursday from 900 percent in the previous 
session the bonds yield rises when its price falls 
analysts also said the bond market took a dim view of the 
governments report that it ran up a 291 billion budget deficit 
in march up from a 239 billion shortfall in february 
david hale chief economist at kemper financial services in 
chicago said the market had expected the deficit to decline by 4 
billion to 5 billion in march instead of rising 
big deficits mean heavy government borrowing which tends to 
push interest rates the cost of borrowing higher as competition 
for funds increases 
oil futures prices one indicator of potential inflation trends 
moved higher thursday after a twoday retreat contracts for june 
delivery of west texas intermediate the benchmark us crude 
closed up 38 cents at 1836 per barrel on the new york mercantile 
exchange

federal reserves report that its three measures of the nations 
money supply rose in early april 
on wall street a sharp afternoon selloff wiped out early gains 
to leave the stock market little changed from wednesdays close 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials was up by more than 30 
points at midsession but finished the day up just 199 at 198740

federal communications commission chairman 
dennis r patrick said today the dialaporn industry is widespread 
and largely ignores statutes designed to prevent its access to 
children 
patrick said fines of 600000 each imposed thursday against two 
california companies were based on their transmission of some 
very rough material over the phone to customers 
the problem is very widespread he said not only in terms 
of socalled dialaporn service providers but what appears to be a 
widespread disregard of the statutory requirements as well as the 
fccs regulatory requirements 
audio enterprises inc of mill valley and intercambio inc of 
san jose both used tape recordings that were changed daily to 
attract callers who were then billed for the calls patrick said 
similar services are advertised in sexoriented magazines and 
newspapers across the country 
the companies were found in violation of regulations designed to 
prevent access of obscene material to minors or transmission of 
such material across state lines 
audio enterprises and intercambio denied the material they used 
was obscene and said they did not have the capacity to screen calls 
patrick interviewed on cbs this morning said both of the 
companies admitted they had made no effort to ensure that only 
consenting adults made the calls 
he said telephone company liability is not at issue under the 
statutes he said on thursday that atampt collected 55 million from 
calls made to one audio enterprises line of which 650000 went to 
audio enterprises 
the use of access codes message scrambling or credit card 
numbers are required by fcc rules but patrick said this is widely 
disregarded 
patrick said the commission had no difficulty determining that 
material available through the two california companies was obscene 
by federal standards 
he said he sees no problem with the first amendment which 
guarantees freedom of speech 
after all the first amendment does not protect obscenity 
he said 
patrick said the fcc generally supports legislative efforts to 
outlaw dialaporn 
congress this week gave final approval to an education bill 
containing a sweeping provision to ban all dialaporn and 
president reagan is expected to sign it but legal experts said it 
was probably unconstitutional 
thursdays fines followed an investigation triggered by 
complaints alleging that access to the sexually explicit messages 
caused the molestation of a 10yearold girl and so disturbed a 
16yearold boy that he had to have psychiatric therapy

union workers voted friday to reject a 
company contract offer and continue an 11week strike against p amp o 
european ferries ltd 
but the company said it still plans to resume sailings from the 
english channel port next week 
several hundred ferry workers at a mass meeting here voted 
overwhelmingly to stay off the job said alan lamoon a local 
representative of the national union of seamen 
he said the main obstacle to settlement was not pay but the 
companys plan to reduce ferry crews from three to two which the 
union contends will threaten safety 
but graeme dunlop p amp o managing director said 60 percent of 
the companys 2200 workers had accepted a revised company offer 
and that the 11ship dover fleet would be back in service next week 
the latest package offers a further 760 a year in wages to 
operators on two routes but makes no concessions on the companys 
plan to cut 360 jobs and revise working hours 
the wage offer would raise annual salaries to between 21360 
and 32885 according to the company

the generous severance plans called golden 
parachutes can turn to lead weights for some fired executives 
lulling them into complacency when they should be out looking for 
work says the president of a large jobplacement firm 
they get seduced by the money the golden parachute is totally 
destructive of people said james challenger of challenger gray 
and christmas inc 
golden parachutes are designed to soften the landing of 
corporate executives booted from office in takeover fights 
but challenger whose company has counseled more than 20000 
displaced workers over the last 25 years said there are cases 
where the parachutes provide such a plush cushion the recipients 
cannot seem to get on their feet again 
i think its a terrible thing to happen to people he said 
to me money doesnt buy happiness people have to work they 
have to like what theyre doing 
challenger said golden parachutes typically consisting of a 
lump sum equal to two to three years salary foster illusions of 
financial security and keep recipients from aggressively seeking 
new jobs 
the job search is or should be a fulltime job in itself until 
employment is gained challenger said the longer the 
individual takes the less he or she is likely to apply themselves 
to the search 
in addition he said a job application showing an extended 
period of unemployment regardless of the reason may raise 
questions about motivation in the mind of a prospective employer 
not all consultants agree 
for most executives who receive golden parachutes the money is 
a bridge between the old job and the next one or between the old 
job and retirement said webb bassick a partner in the 
compensationconsulting firm of hewitt associates in lincolnshire 
ill 
were talking about people who make hundreds of thousands of 
dollars a year he said its not as simple as picking up the 
want ads and finding a job 
bassick suggested challengers real beef might be that 
jobseekers with lots of money in the bank can afford to be picky 
making them difficult to place 
but challenger said that his company collects its fees from the 
job seekers old employer and that his opposition to golden 
parachutes is altruistic not economic 
im opposed to anything that ruins a persons life he said 
recipients of some of the most famous golden parachutes do not 
appear to have abandoned their careers for the lifestyle of the 
independently wealthy 
william haselton former chairman of st regis corp drew about 
12 million in compensation stock payments and a cash settlement 
the golden parachute from st regis when it was bought by 
champion international corp in 1984 but he stayed on as 
champions vice chairman 
donald p kelly the former head of esmark inc got a 27 
million compensation package in 1984 when beatrice cos acquired 
the company 
two years later kelly joined the investment firm kohlberg 
kravis roberts in taking beatrice private in a record 62 billion 
leveraged buyout 
as a followup to that deal beatrice spun off eii holdings 
which is now being acquired by american brands inc in a 27 
billion deal this time kellys compensation reportedly includes a 
25 million parachute 
but multimilliondollar packages represent the high end of 
executive severance plans challenger said 
the goldenparachute concept has spread to smaller companies 
where top executives earn less than 100000 a year 
at that level severance pay is not enough to retire on but it 
is enough to get lazy on he said 
challenger would not provide names but cited the case of a 
former realestate company executive whose golden parachute 
included some lucrative property holdings 
this man can go around and look at his properties and say hes 
managing them but he really isnt managing them challenger 
said this man is in his early 40s he cant spend his years 
doing this

jp stevens amp co late thursday rejected a 
122 billion takeover offer from rival bidders whose buyout 
proposal included splitting the textile giants assets among them 
sources said a special committee of outside directors on 
stevens board informed fabric maker west pointpepperell inc and 
the investment firm odyssey partners that their joint 
6850ashare bid was unacceptable 
the directors objections focused on the length of time the 
groups offer would be extended as well as whether odyssey would 
have been able to get financing to purchase its share of assets 
which sources said were valued at about 530 million 
because the offer was conditioned upon odysseys purchase of 
assets that raised the uncertainty that disturbed the board 
said one source close to the transaction 
sources also said that under the proposal west point could have 
extended its offer beyond the 10 business days extension required 
by securities and exchange commission rules 
the board committee asked that the conditions be eliminated 
according to one source who added now the balls in their 
court 
among the assets odyssey would purchase were stevens greige 
goods or unfinished textile operations the division sells about 
235 million a year in unfinished fabrics and yarn 
odysseys outstanding a 6850ashare tender offer which has 
been recommended by the stevens board is set to expire at midnight 
edt tuesday the same day pepperells competing 67ashare tender 
offer is set to expire 
the two companies which had bid against each other three times 
in a heated auction announced earlier in the week that they were 
negotiating about making a joint bid for stevens for 6850 a share 
in cash 
separately the attorneys general of new york and the carolinas 
agreed to issue subpoenas thursday to pepperell odyssey and bibb 
co which has signed an agreement with pepperell to purchase 
certain stevens assets 
south carolina attorney general travis medlock said he was 
concerned the three companies in combining their efforts to 
acquire stevens may have engaged in bidrigging a violation 
of antitrust laws in determining what price to pay for stevens 
stock 
a spokesman for pepperell said today that the company has not 
been accused of any antitrust violations and we are confident 
everything we have done is in accord with all applicable laws 
the west point ga textile company is making its bid for 
stevens in conjunction with ntc group the parent of textile 
manufacturer bibb 
pepperell has received federal trade commission permission to 
sell half of stevens bath lines and 20 percent of its sheet lines 
to ntc group for about 170 million 
bidding for stevens began after it received a leveraged buyout 
offer earlier this year from a group led by its own senior 
management including chairman whitney stevens a fifthgeneration 
member of the family that founded the company in 1813 
pepperell launched a 6250ashare tender offer last month 
after stevens agreed to a buyout by odyssey at 6150 a share 
odyssey subsequently sweetened its offer to 64 
pepperell increased its tender offer to 67 a share but odyssey 
topped that by 150 a share just hours later

dig in your pocket or purse fish out a 
handful of coins and ask yourself the question should the design 
of americas pennies nickels dimes quarters and half dollars be 
changed 
a campaign is gathering steam in congress to do exactly that 
advocates for change say the nations coins should reflect the 
nations present not its past and they claim that minting new 
coins would raise an estimated 23 billion for the governments 
deficitplagued coffers over six years 
thats no small change but the figure is disputed 
donna pope director of the us mint told the senate banking 
committee today that redesigning the nations coins would likely 
raise a few million dollars in profits but not billions 
she estimated that the difference between production costs and 
the face value of the coins would bring in about 22 million a 
year and that an additional 3 million in annual profits can be 
expected from sales of proof sets of the coins to collectors 
yet she said that the us treasury finds generally nothing 
objectionable in the proposal 
the sparkplug behind the coinredesign campaign is diane wolf a 
member of the united states commission of fine arts which has 
endorsed the redesign plan 
making her case to the banking committee ms wolf said that it 
is important to improve the design of the nations coinage because 
not only do our coins tell people in faraway lands something 
about us and our heroes ideals dreams and celebrations they also 
speak to the ages 
rep frank annunzio dill chairman of the banking committees 
consumer affairs and coinage subcommittee says the record shows 
that chances of making billions of dollars from a redesign of the 
nations coins are remote at best 
the legislation would retain the presidents who currently grace 
the fronts of those coins lincoln on the penny jefferson on the 
nickel roosevelt on the dime washington on the quarter and john 
f kennedy on the half dollar 
but it would permit different portraits to be used and the 
tails of the coins would be changed completely 
the legislation dictates that the reverse of the quarter carry 
for a twoyear period a design commemorating the bicentennial of 
the constitution 
other elements of the design would be selected and approved by 
the treasury department perhaps after a national competition by 
leading artists 
miss wolf says the newly minted coins could be rattling into 
cash registers by 1989 if congress acts quickly this year 
aesthetically the coinage really needs a redesign she said 
in an interview 
this is the longest time we have gone without permanent 
changes on our coinage she said 
the head of lincoln on the penny is 79 years old the tail was 
last designed in 1959 the quarter is 56 years old the nickel was 
last designed in 1938 the dime was last designed in 1946 
according to miss wolf the new coins would be identical in size 
shape and color to present pocket change 
theres no real opposition miss wolf said everyone is 
gung ho on it there are no negatives to this we can make billions 
to reduce the deficit without raising taxes 
no opposition thats not quite the case 
annunzio has expressed reservations especially about the 
proposition that changing the design of coins raises billions 
miss wolf argues that since it costs the mint just 2 cents to 
produce a single coin it can issue them for face value making 
money on every coin but the penny 
she says much more money would pour in from collectors who would 
rush to buy proof and uncirculated sets of the new coins 
but annunzio told the house on tuesday that there have been six 
coin design changes over the past 42 years and none supports the 
theory that when coins change their faces the money rolls in 
in fact some of the changes showed a decline in mintages 
he said those claiming that design changes will generate 
billions of dollars in revenues base those claims on assumptions 
that have no connection with fact or reality 
indeed the evidence suggests that the effect that coin design 
changes has on coin demand is so small as to be impossible to 
measure it is negligible at best 
in any case annunzio said the secretary of the treasury has the 
authority to change the design of coins without approval by 
congress 
we should reject attempts to respond to the sirens song of 
easy revenue through coin design changes annunzio said there 
are no profits to be made 
what about people who are comfortable with the coin designs as 
they are and want no changes 
that might be the first impression of some people miss wolf 
said but she said good new designs would convert them 
after all she said the classic buffalo nickel went the way of 
the beast it depicted and so did the old mercury dime 
coins really reflect how we feel about ourselves as a people 
coins should reflect our times she said and the coinage we 
have just doesnt

attorneys for three tobacco companies today 
unsuccessfully sought a mistrial in a major cigarette liability 
case arguing the judges criticim of the industry and publicity 
about his statements may have tainted the jury 
us district judge h lee sarokin acting thursday on the 
companies request to have the case thrown out said there was 
enough evidence of a coverup by the tobacco industry that a jury 
should decide the suit however he did dismiss some of the 
complaints against the companies liggett group inc philip 
morris inc and lorillard inc 
this morning sarokin rejected the companies request for a 
mistrial he upheld his ruling after polling the jurors 
individually in private and discovering they did not know of 
thursdays finding 
in his sometimes scathing opinion sarokin wrote the evidence 
presented permits the jury to find a tobacco industry 
conspiracy vast in its scope devious in its purpose and 
devastating in its results 
the suit by antonio cipollone of lakehurst alleges that the 
companies were responsible for the lung cancer death of his wife 
rose who died at age 58 in 1984 after smoking for 40 years 
chuck wall a spokesman for philip morris and lorillard on 
thursday took exception to the tone of sarokins opinion i do 
think there were flourishes there from the judges pen that went 
beyond the plaintiffs evidence he said 
sarokin dismissed claims that the three companies caused mrs 
cipollones cancer by not marketing a safer cigarette and by not 
conducting adequate research into the health effects of smoking 
the suit has been on trial since feb 1 and cipollones lawyers 
have rested their case which they tout as groundbreaking because 
for the first time a plaintiffs lawyers obtained access to 
confidential files of tobacco companies and trade groups detailing 
their public relations strategies 
in his 33page opinion sarokin wrote that the evidence 
indicated the companies conspired to conceal and misrepresent 
information on the dangers of smoking and to refute undermine 
and neutralize information coming from the scientific and medical 
community 
the judge said the evidence also indicated the companies tried 
to confuse and mislead the consuming public in an effort to 
encourage existing smokers to continue and new persons to commence 
smoking 
the jury may reasonably conclude that defendants were members 
of and engaged in that conspiracy with full knowledge and disregard 
for the illness and death it would cause and that mrs cipollone 
was merely one of its victims sarokin said 
rejecting the defense request to dismiss all claims he wrote 
if the jury accepts the plaintiffs version of the facts as to 
the conduct of the defendants it is difficult to envision a more 
compelling case for an award of punitive damages 
despite the criticism of the tobacco companies wall said he 
believed cipollones case was gutted by sarokins opinion the 
conspiracy claim is very tenuous at best he said 
cipollones attorneys denied the claims dismissed by the judge 
went to the heart of their case i think the judge was moved by 
the evidence its powerful evidence said attorney alan darnell 
attorney cynthia a walters denied that her side suffered a 
critical blow when the judge ruled the plaintiff could not prove 
mrs cipollone would have smoked a safer cigarette if the companies 
had marketed one 
referring to evidence that the companies knew how to produce a 
safer cigarette but chose not to she said we thought it was an 
important theme not so much for this case but for the broader 
implications in future cases 
sarokin also dismissed a claim that mrs cipollones death was 
caused in part by the companies failure to do enough research on 
the dangers of smoking while there was ample evidence that the 
research was inadequate the judge said cipollones attorneys did 
not prove that this directly harmed mrs cipollone 
a third claim that the companies failed to warn smokers of the 
dangers of cigarettes was dismissed against philip morris and 
lorillard 
sarokin said mrs cipollone smoked only liggett cigarettes 
before 1966 when federally mandated warnings on cigarette packs 
were required he said there is evidence from which the jury 
could infer that prior to 1966 ordinary consumers were not 
adequately informed of the health risks of smoking he said 
james kearney an attorney for liggett said the company was 
confident we will prevail on the basis of evidence that comes out 
during our presentation

norway said friday that it would continue 
restraining its oil output by 75 percent of actual production 
during the second half of 1988 
norway is not a member of the organization of oil exporting 
countries but it has supported opecs effort to curb production to 
help stabilize worldwide oil prices since february 1986 
the effort will continue on the condition that other exporting 
countries carry out realistic regulation efforts to stabilize oil 
prices at a reasonably high level norways oil and energy 
ministry said in a statement 
the ruling was made by the cabinet and does not need approval by 
the parliament 
since no new oil fields are scheduled to open in norway during 
the years second half the decision means the nation will restrain 
its total production capacity of 106 million barrels a day by 
about 85000 barrels 
egil helle a ministry spokesman acknowledged a connection 
between the decision and the april 26 meeting between opec and at 
least seven nonopec oil producers norway will not officially 
attend the meeting although it will send an observer 
we have had many questions from outside norway in connection 
with the meeting and our attitude toward a stable oil market 
helle said explaining the reason for his announcement 
a senior oil ministry official said last week norway would be 
willing to consider further restraints if production cuts are 
agreed on at the vienna meeting

the head of a presidential panel that 
investigated the october stock market crash says massive selling of 
us treasury bonds by japanese investors incited the plunge the 
wall street journal reported friday 
nicholas f brady cochairman of the investment banking firm 
dillon read amp co also claims the federal reserve injected more 
than 10 billion into the us financial system in the days after 
the crash the journal said federal reserve officials said they 
could not comment 
brady was quoted as making the assertions at a meeting of 
institutional investors and money managers thursday in washington 
he was traveling friday and his secretary said he was unreachable 
his reported remarks were considered significant not only 
because brady led the panel that investigated the crash but also 
because of his possible future role as a treasury secretary if vice 
president george bush wins the presidential election brady is a 
bush confidant 
people ask me what was it that blew it off on the 19th of 
october was it the twin trade and budget deficits was it the 
rostenkowski tax legislation what was it brady was quoted as 
saying 
i dont think it was any of those things that really was the 
trigger he was quoted as saying the real trigger was that 
the japanese came in for their own reasons and sold an enormous 
amount of us government bonds and drove the 30year government 
bond up through 10 percent and when it got through 10 percent 
that got a lot of people thinking gee thats four times the 
return you get on equity here we go inflation again 
the brady panels crash report released in january said the 
weakening dollar and higher interest rates were key elements in the 
uncertainty that helped cause the crash 
but his reported remarks thursday marked the first time japanese 
holders of us bonds were specifically mentioned as the catalyst 
it wasnt clear from the journal account whether brady had changed 
or amended his views after the study was done 
brady also was quoted as expressing frustration with the 
progress of postcrash changes in market regulation particularly 
the apparent jurisdictional fight between the securities and 
exchange commission which watches stock trading and the 
commodities futures trading commission which watches stockindex 
futures and options activity 
he also was quoted as warning that if the market crashes again 
punitive legislation would result

irving bank corp was ordered by a state judge 
friday to hold a shareholders meeting may 6 to determine whether 
the company should merge with rival bank of new york co or sell a 
major stake to italys secondlargest bank 
irving had postponed its annual meeting from saturday to june 13 
to give shareholders time to review the bank of new york bid and a 
managementbacked offer from the staterun banca commerciale 
italiana of milan made earlier this week 
but bank of new york challenged the legality of thursdays move 
denouncing it as a stalling tactic and an outrageous and 
unprecedented attempt to thwart the rights of shareholders 
in fridays ruling new york supreme court judge herman cahn 
directed irving to convene its meeting saturday then adjourn it to 
may 6 to allow time for the shareholders to vote on a slate of 
irving directors and other matters that will determine the fate of 
the two competing bids for the bank 
both irving and bank of new york said they were pleased with 
cahns order irving attorney robert falise said the courts 
decision confirms irvings decision to give shareholders more 
time to learn about and analyze the fastmoving developments of 
recent days and any other development that may happen before may 
6 
bank of new york spokesman owen brady said the court provided 
a victory for shareholder democracy by refusing to allow irving 
to postpone its annual meeting until late spring 
once again the manipulative tactics of irvings management 
have been rejected by the courts he said 
irving said thursday that it had agreed to negotiate with bank 
of new york for the first time in their bitter 7monthold 
takeover fight but also would continue negotiating with banca 
commerciale irving said it believed it could obtain improvements 
in both offers 
bank of new york is offering 15 in cash and 1575 of its common 
shares for the approximately 95 percent of irving it doesnt 
already own the tender offer began last month following regulatory 
approval 
the company also is running a slate of 16 nominees for irvings 
board of directors 
banca commerciale which emerged as a white knight merger 
partner monday has offered to pay 75 a share for 85 million 
irving shares or a 45 percent stake in the company banca 
commerciale also would have the right to buy an additional 10 
percent of irving stock on the open market after the deal was 
consummated 
the deal was part of a complex restructuring that irving 
proposed as an alternative to bank of new yorks hostile offer the 
plan included the sale of several irving assets including its 
50story wall street headquarters 
to win shareholder support irving also proposed to raise net 
income by about 160 a share in 1988 and 275 next year through 
costcutting measures and to pay a special 10ashare special cash 
dividend from the gains on the asset sales

that would make the offer worth at least 276 million at 40 
per share for the 69 million shares icahn does not already control 
edward j starkman who watches twa for painewebber inc said 
icahns offer was a little richer than what a lot of people were 
looking for 
were thinking in terms of its being worth 36 to 38 per 
share roughly and those kind of numbers look pretty good he 
said 
julius maldutis an analyst at the salomon brothers securities 
firm declined to comment on icahns offer other than to say he 
believed twas stock was worth between 40 and 42 per share 
icahns previous offer was 20 in cash and 25 in face amount of 
the bonds per share 
a statement released by twa said the new offer was conditioned 
on approval by a majority of the twa shareholders not affiliated 
with icahn and the satisfaction of appropriate regulatory 
requirements 
in addition it said icahn reserved the right to change the 
terms if twas stake in texaco consisting of about 206 million 
shares or 85 percent of the oil giants stock should change 
substantially in value 
once consummated employee stock ownership plans would be 
established to give the airlines employees about 10 percent 
ownership in the newly merged company a statement issued by twa 
said 
separately twa announced it lost 555 million in the first 
quarter slightly less than the 548 million it lost in the same 
period last year 
these results reflect substantially greater interest charges 
during the first quarter of 1988 than existed in the first quarter 
of 1987 and do not include unrealized gains of approximately 340 
million from twas portfolio of marketable securites a statement 
said 
nearly 220 million of those gains occurred in the first 
quarter it added 
the company said its 78 million firstquarter operating loss 
which compared with a 243 million operating loss in the same 
period of 1987 was the best operating performance for twas 
traditionally most unprofitable quarter in over 20 years 
operating revenues totaled 920225 in the three months ended 
march 31 compared with 823998 in the 1987 first quarter

last august lotus development corp 
chairman jim p manzi exercised his options 
the 36yearold head of the nations leading software and 
personal computer maker bought 843691 shares of company stock at a 
price that realized a net value of 25356425 according to 
company reports 
toss in his salary and bonuses and manzi made about 263 
million in 1987 outpacing chrysler corp chairman lee iacocca by 
about 84 million on a list of toppaid executives compiled by 
business week magazine 
some wall street analysts say manzi simply was shrewd to take 
advantage of a boom year for the computer company known for its 
lotus 123 software but when manzi turned around and sold a huge 
chunk of stock six months later he used the system to the 
detriment of the average stockholder they said 
i think if companies are going to issue the amount of options 
that lotus does then management should be proud to be a 
shareholder in the company and not use the options to continually 
cash in said james m meyer an analyst with janney montgomery 
scott inc 
under the system of stock options executives are given the 
opportunity to buy company stock at a set market price they can 
exercise the option years afterward when the stock price may be 
trading above the option price 
they generally are used as incentives under the theory that if 
an executives performance rises so will the companys value 
in general i root for these executives who get big paychecks 
from chasing in stock options said kevin j murphy an economics 
professor at the university of rochesters william e simon 
business school 
there has been a boom market that helps those firms a lot by 
far the best measure of performance is the stock price 
manzi was given a lucrative package of compensation incentives 
when he joined lotus in 1983 a time when the company already was 
succeeding the former newspaper reporter became marketing director 
and quickly rose to president in 1984 
he exercised his stock options in a year that saw lotus stock 
jump 78 percent ending the year at 3075 a share on the new york 
stock exchange in february manzi said he sold 250000 shares in 
order to pay taxes on the options earnings 
lotus defended the sales by manzi and other executives which 
preceded a drop in the companys earnings forecast and a delay in a 
new version of its popular 123 electronic spreadsheet program 
jim manzi is one of lotus largest shareholders and 
substantially all of the gains he realized in 1987 from stock 
options have been reinvested in the company robert schechter 
lotus chief financial officer said in a statement 
his compensation reflects not just his 1987 compensation 
but more accurately an amount earned over four years when his 
compensation package was assembled 
critics of stock options say that lucrative compensation 
packages often give executives a free ride if the stock market is 
rising even if individual performance is sluggish 
and if a companys gains already are high executives may try to 
preserve what they already have instead of investing anew which 
shareholders might prefer 
for very senior managements at the corporate level stock 
options make lots of sense because what they do is link the 
interests of top management with the owners of the firm said 
alfred rappaport a northwestern university accounting professor 
but he added that having lots of stock options doesnt 
necessarily make management as aggressive as shareholders would 
like them to be in terms of ventures and new investments 
as for manzis 941000 cash earnings analysts said theyre not 
out of line even though lotus is not a fortune 500 company and it 
reported a net income of 72 million last year 
its clearly a lot but lotus has had some pretty spectacular 
performances said gordon wolf vice president for executive pay 
practice at the new york consulting firm of towers perrin forster amp 
crosby if you really believe that paper performance is what its 
about then when you make it you pay it

jp stevens amp co said friday it rejected a 
122 billion takeover offer from rival bidders whose joint buyout 
proposal includes splitting the textile giants assets among them 
a special committee of stevens board informed fabric maker west 
pointpepperell inc and the investment firm odyssey partners that 
their joint 6850ashare cash proposal was unacceptable in its 
present form 
the directors who met late thursday to review the proposal 
objected to conditioning the joint deal on odyssey getting 
financing and completing the purchase of about 530 million in 
stevens assets 
instead directors backed odysseys separate outstanding 
6850ashare tender offer which is due to expire at midnight 
tuesday and would assure a quick resolution to the takeover battle 
a source close to the transaction said the joint proposal would 
take longer to complete and could allow the principals to back out 
analysts were puzzled over why financing would be an issue 
since odyssey already has received over 1 billion in commitments 
to fund its own bid pepperell has a competing 67ashare tender 
offer outstanding which also expires tuesday 
the special committee said it would back the pepperellodyssey 
plan only if it had no conditions relating to the odyssey asset 
transaction 
in trading on the new york stock exchange stevens stock closed 
at 6750 a share unchanged from thursday 
analysts speculated that pepperell might have reached the upper 
limit of its financing capacity and might need the proceeds from 
the asset sale to odyssey to clinch the deal 
they might be running out of money said deborah bronston a 
textile analyst at prudentialbache securities inc 
odyssey and pepperell which bid against each other three times 
in a heated auction announced tuesday that they were holding talks 
about making a joint bid for stevens 
odyssey had appeared to be playing the white knight role by 
coming on the scene with a friendly offer after pepperell had made 
its first unsolicited offer now however stevens feels it has 
been stabbed in the back said one analyst who asked not to be 
named 
one source close to the transaction said odyssey feels they 
owe some degree of loyalty to both sides 
among the assets odyssey likely would purchase were stevens 
unfinished textile operations the division sells about 235 
million a year in unfinished fabrics and yarn 
separately the attorneys general of new york and the carolinas 
have issued subpoenas to pepperell odyssey and bibb co which has 
signed an agreement with pepperell to purchase certain stevens 
assets 
south carolina attorney general travis medlock said thursday he 
was concerned the three companies in combining their efforts to 
acquire stevens may have engaged in bidrigging to determine 
what price to pay for stevens stock 
chris braithwaite a spokesman for new york attorney general 
robert abrams said that two competing bidders talking about the 
price and purchase of stevens raises questions under state and 
federal antitrust laws the subpoenas seek documents and 
testimony about alleged discussions concerning the acquisition of 
stevens he said 
pepperell noted in a statement friday that it has not been 
accused of any antitrust violations and we are confident 
everything we have done is in accord with all applicable laws 
the west point ga textile company is making its bid for 
stevens in conjunction with ntc group the parent of textile 
manufacturer bibb 
pepperell has received federal trade commission permission to 
sell half of stevens bath lines and 20 percent of its sheet lines 
to ntc group for about 170 million 
analysts agreed that pepperells interest in stevens centers 
exclusively on the companys sheet and towel operations which 
include manufacturing facilities as well as designer brand names 
those operations account for 60 percent of stevens annual sales 
which amounted to 161 billion last year 
among the top brand names in stevens towel and sheet arsenal 
are ralph lauren laura ashley gloria vanderbilt perry ellis 
pierre cardin and givenchy among others pepperells brands 
include arrow martex lady pepperell and burberry 
separately stevens said friday it planned to file a 
counterclaim against pepperell in delaware chancery court charging 
that pepperell interfered with stevens existing merger agreement 
with odyssey

chrysler corp says it will shift production of 
all its dodge aries and plymouth reliant kcars from the united 
states to mexico 
chrylser spokesman steve harris said thursday that the move was 
designed to make more room for assembly of the automakers dodge 
omniplymouth horizon models in detroit and a new midsize car in 
newark del 
production of the omnihorizon models is being shifted at the 
end of the 1988 model year to detroits jefferson avenue plant from 
chryslers kenosha wis plant at a cost of 5500 jobs

still a significant demand for the kcars so we intend to produce 
it the market will determine the level of production 
united auto workers union leaders in wisconsin said they were 
angry over the move which dashed hope that the kenosha plant might 
resume operation should demand for the omnihorizon models and 
kcars remain strong 
their scheme is now being exposed said rudy kuzel chief 
bargainer for uaw local 72 in kenosha which is negotiating with 
chrysler over terms of the shutdown this is going to make it 
much more difficult to get the contract settled 
the talks which will shift to detroit next week involve 
provisions for workers who will be laid off as well as a contract 
covering about 1000 uaw members who will keep their jobs at 
chryslers engine plant in kenosha 
i dont remember anybody in mexico doing anything to save the 
chrysler corporation kuzel saidborn in america and moved to

the new federal rules banning smoking on flights under two hours 
may send some inveterate smokers climbing the cabin walls but 
airlines and experts on smoking have been quick to offer advice 
the american institute for preventive medicine for example has 
developed a kit called flying smokeless 
the institute based in southfield mich runs quitsmoking and 
other health programs at hospitals and businesses around the 
companies its selling the kits a cassette tape and a 
smokeless emergency pack for 1145 
dr don r powell the groups executive director says several 
airlines have expressed interest in buying the program including 
northwest eastern american and delta 
the cassette teaches behavior modification techniques that 
overcome the desire to smoke the institute says while the pack 
contains cigarette substitutes such as sugarless gum mints and 
toothpicks 
other tips from powell include putting a rubber band around the 
wrist of your smoking hand and snapping it whenever a nicotine urge 
strikes 
united airlines which has been gearing up for the smoking ban 
since april 13 offers some suggestions from its medical director 
dr gary kohn 
put something in your mouth other than a cigarette chew gum 
carry some celery or a carrot on a flight and munch on it inhale 
on a straw or suck on a toothpick or cinnamon sticks carry breath 
mints throat lozenges or hard candies 
if you usually smoke while drinking coffee soft drinks or 
alcohol during flights try switching to fruit juices water or 
milk 
share thoughts by striking up a conversation with a fellow 
passenger instead of striking a match for a cigarette write 
letters and notes to friends and family compose a business memo 
practice deep breathing breathe in slowly through your nose 
for two counts exhale slowly through pursed lips for a count of 
four 
read a book or a magazine 
dr powell on the other hand isnt keen on the idea of reading 
in every case he advises jittery smokers to recognize cues 
that trigger smoking such as reading or drinking coffee and avoid 
them 
if these dont work theres a powerful stimulus that should 
stifle the smoking urge the fines of up to 1000 for violating 
the federal ban

orders to the nations factories for big 
ticket items remained strong in march the government said 
friday bolstering analysts views that the economy is growing at a 
healthy pace 
the commerce department said orders for durable goods items 
expected to last three or more years were virtually unchanged 
rising less than 01 percent to 1143 billion in march as a drop 
in military hardware more than offset gains elsewhere 
that was far less than the 13 percent advance most economists 
were expecting however the government raised its estimate of new 
orders in february the revised report shows a 01 percent gain for 
the month rather than the previously reported 11 percent drop 
the net result is a relatively strong level of orders through 
the first quarter of this year 79 percent above a year ago when 
compared march to march 
i would describe it as a picture that shows modest growth 
in the economy not a boom but no signs of a big dip said jerry 
jasinowski chief economist of the national association of 
manufacturers 
roger brinner an economist with data resources inc a 
lexington mass forecasting firm said it is very premature 
to worry about sluggish growth in new orders because shipments 
remain strong and the backlog in unfilled orders remains high 
nevertheless the lowerthanexpected results for march along 
with a stronger dollar overseas helped both the bond and stock 
markets which have been depressed over fears of inflation and 
higher interest rates 
the key 30year treasury bonds price rose about 5 per 1000 
in face amount and its yield fell back under 9 percent on wall 
street the dow jones industrial average rose 2769 points to 
201509 
shipments of durable goods rose 26 percent last month to 1133 
billion after a 14 percent rise in february the backlog of 
unfilled orders was up 02 percent to 3999 billion in march 
following a 10 percent rise the month before 
a tremendous backlog has built up so shipments will remain 
high no matter how many new orders come in brinner said 
if orders held flat for the rest of the year you would still get a 
very strong level of shipments compared to last year 
in march a 30 percent drop in the volatile defense goods 
category to 83 billion offset a 03 percent increase in orders 
for nondefense goods which rose to 1060 billion 
orders for primary metals such as steel jumped 42 percent in 
march after rising 09 percent in february at 108 billion they 
stood 194 percent ahead of last year 
there was also strength in transportation primarily motor 
vehicles and aircraft this sector rose 25 percent to 313 
billion after a strong 55 percent boost in february 
orders for electrical machinery plummeted 47 percent to 186 
billion while nonelectrical machinery edged down 02 percent to 
197 billion however orders in both categories remained 13 
percent above a year ago 
smokestack usa is back weve got strong growth in the 
basic areas like steel thats really pacing the economy now the 
problem is that growth might be too strong said david jones an 
economist with aubrey g langston amp co a government securities 
dealer in new york 
after the october stock market crash analysts worried about a 
slowdown in the economy during the first three months of this year 
however they now are more concerned that too much demand could 
increase inflation

the united auto workers union said 
friday that chrysler corps decision to import the dodge aries and 
plymouth reliant from mexico next year threatens chances of an 
early contract settlement and increases the likelihood of a strike 
i hearby warn the chrysler corp that if they cause these 
negotiations to go in the ditch the chances of a strike in 
september would be 95 percent or better uaw vice president marc 
stepp told a news conference 
the flap is the latest of several since the opening monday of 
early national labor contract negotiations between the no 3 
automaker and the uaw the contract covers at least 66000 workers 
in 15 states 
workers and union negotiators also were angered by the 
compensation executives received in 1987 the figures including 
179 million chrysler chairman lee iacocca received in salary 
cash and stock bonuses and exercised stock options were revealed 
in proxy statements mailed tuesday 
in addition stepp has said that despite chrysler vice president 
anthony st johns assurances otherwise chrysler is trying to veer 
sharply from an industrypattern contract established at ford motor 
co and general motors corp last fall 
st john chryslers chief bargainer denied chrysler is 
transferring production of the soontobe discontinued 
ariesreliant kcar to mexico at the expense of american jobs 
instead he said production at an existing kcar plant in toluca 
mexico will be boosted by 40000 cars for one year while 
chryslers two us kcar plants are converted to making other 
products 
ironically chrysler is selling the frontwheeldrive kcars 
whose success saved chrysler from bankruptcy in the early 1980s as 
america series models 
st john said the total number of kcars exported to the united 
states 60000 between oct 1 1988 and sept 30 1989 would be 
enough to support only one third of one shift at either chryslers 
newark del or jefferson avenue detroit plant each plant can 
build 235000 cars a year using two shifts 
the temporary increase in toluca production will provide cars 
primarily to fill fleet orders during the kcar phaseout he said 
meanwhile the venerable omnihorizon small car will be moved 
into jefferson avenue from a former american motors corp plant in 
kenosha wis this summer and the newark plant will begin building 
the spirit and acclaim the kcars replacement st john said 
jefferson will employ as many or more workers making the 
omnihorizon as it does now 
workers and government officials in wisconsin were angered by 
the announcement because they believed the omnihorizon could have 
been kept at the 5500worker kenosha plant slated to close by 
years end if the jefferson plant continued to make the kcar 
but stepp said he understood that kcar production wouldnt be 
high enough to support jefferson he said the company should keep 
the kcar and build it on the same assembly line with the 
omnihorizon disagreeing with st johns assertion that it wasnt 
possible 
the subject of importing cars from mexico is a particularly sore 
one at chrysler because while the company emphasizes patriotism in 
its advertising it imports many of its cars including all models 
in its new eagle lineup 
at the same time it is closing the kenosha plant and tried to 
sell its 28000worker acustar inc parts subsidiary so it could 
buy more from outside companies and lowwage foreign countries 
chrysler us workers earn 1443 an hour in mexico chrysler 
workers earn 2 to 250 an hour said chrysler spokesman lloyd 
northard

gold futures prices fell sharply friday surprising analysts and 
extending the metals decline over four days on new yorks 
commodity exchange to more than 9 a troy ounce 
on other markets pork belly futures plunged while livestock 
futures were mixed soybeans advanced while grains were mixed 
energy futures were mostly lower and stock index futures advanced 
metals analysts said the stronger dollar may have had some 
negative impact on precious metals markets but not enough to fully 
explain the plunge in gold futures which lost as much as 610 a 
troy ounce during the session 
i wasnt expecting a selloff today of this sort of 
magnitude said richard levine vice president of the metals and 
foreign exchange group at elders futures inc in new york 
analyst craig sloane of smith barney harris upham amp co said a 
government report showing virtually no change last month in factory 
orders for durable goods was somewhat disappointing but also was 
hardly enough to spark fridays decline in metals 
theres been no real negative news he said i guess 
theres just been nothing exciting going on and the market has sold 
off and just kind of fed on itself for a while 
another analyst bernard savakl of painewebber inc linked the 
selloff to talk of japanese sales of platinum and government 
concern over taiwanese purchases of gold 
gold settled 450 to 610 lower with the contract for delivery 
in june at 45240 a troy ounce silver was 45 cents to 53 cents 
lower with may at 6415 a troy ounce 
pork belly futures plunged as much as 132 cents a pound on the 
chicago mercantile exchange on expectations that a monthly 
government report issued after the close would show a large 
increase in the number of bellies in cold storage the assumption 
was correct 
the agriculture department counted about 905 million pounds of 
frozen pork bellies at the end of march an increase of nearly 235 
million pounds during the month and the thirdlargest march 31 
total on record 
analyst chuck levitt said the report would have little market 
impact since it matched expectations 
but two other usda reports issued friday the monthly and 
quarterly cattleonfeed reports will likely send cattle futures 
50 to 100 points lower on monday levitt said 
the quarterly report showed a 6 percent increase since last year 
in the total number of cattle being fattened for slaughter a 2 
percent rise in placements on feedlots during the first quarter and 
a 1 percent increase in cattle marketings 
the monthly report also showed greaterthanexpected numbers of 
cattle on feed higherthanexpected placements and 
lowerthanexpected marketings 
no matter how you cut it first quarter placements appear to 
be the largest on record and that has to take some kind of toll in 
the marketplace levitt said 
live cattle settled 20 cent lower to 15 cent higher with june 
at 7082 cents a pound feeder cattle were 10 cent to 48 cent 
higher with april at 7997 cents a pound hogs were 15 cent lower 
to 23 cent higher with june at 4875 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 60 cent to 132 cents lower with may at 5202 cents a 
pound 
soybean futures closed sharply higher on the chicago board of 
trade as weather forecasters reduced their predictions for next 
weeks rainfall the grains were mixed 
longrange forecasts issued thursday predicted good amounts of 
rain next week in the midwest and great plains where corn and 
soybean planting is beginning and rain is needed to get the crops 
off to a good start prices fell thursday in reaction to the 
forecasts 
but new forecasts friday predicted lesser amounts of rain and 
the markets rallied on the news analysts said 
wheat settled 1 cent lower to cent higher with may at 315 a 
bushel corn was 1 cents lower to 1 cents higher with may at 
201 a bushel oats were cent lower to 1 cents higher with may 
at 164 a bushel soybeans were 3 cents to 6 cents higher with 
may at 663 a bushel 
energy futures settled mostly lower on the new york mercantile 
exchange in nervous trading ahead of next weeks meeting of opec 
and nonopec oil producers analysts said 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 4 cents to 6 cents 
lower with june at 1830 a barrel heating oil was 14 cent lower 
to 11 cent higher with may at 5060 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 16 cent lower to 10 cent higher with may at 5229 
cents a gallon

prosecutors insisted friday that ivan f boesky 
got a fair punishment for his crimes despite the convicted 
speculators plea for more leniency from a judge who sentenced him 
to three years imprisonment 
boesky the disgraced stock speculator at the center of a major 
insider trading scandal asked us district judge morris lasker 
late last week to reduce his sentence for conspiracy to violate 
securities law 
boesky who could have been sentenced to a maximum five years 
said through his lawyers that he deserves milder treatment because 
he has provided prosecutors with additional evidence on new 
topics new transactions new relationships and new securities 
that disclosure indicated boesky is now giving evidence about 
people he hadnt implicated in earlier statements to prosecutors 
before his sentencing 
lasker sentenced boesky in december the speculator began 
serving his sentence at a minimum security prison at lompoc calif 
last month and will be eligible for parole after one year 
in a twopage affidavit responding to boeskys request 
assistant us attorney john k carroll said boesky is continuing 
to cooperate and the governments investigations relating to 
information he has provided continues 
but carrol also maintained that in the governments view 
boeskys threeyear sentence was and remains an appropriate 
sentence in light of all the competing factors 
in his 35page affidavit requesting sentence reduction boesky 
lawyer leon silverman asked lasker to delay ruling until october 
by which time the extraordinary extent and value of mr boeskys 
cooperation will become even more evident 
carrol also agreed that lasker should delay ruling until october 
boesky was a leading speculator in the stocks of potential 
takeover targets when he rocked wall street in november 1986 by 
agreeing to pay 100 million to settle civil insider trading 
charges brought by the securities and exchange commission 
in addition to settling the civil case without admitting guilt 
boesky also agreed to plead guilty to the single felony count and 
has been cooperating since then with prosecutors

a fouryear belttightening program at general 
motors corp could save more than 125 billion by 1990 up from 
previous estimates of 10 billion gm officials told auto industry 
analysts friday 
a wider profit margin as well as a bigger share of the auto 
market are keys to reaching a 15 percent return on common 
stockholder equity by that time gm chairman roger smith told gms 
1988 automotive security analysts meeting in new york 
gm president robert c stempel told the group 1987 was a 
transition year for the company 
sales and market share rebounded strongly in the first quarter 
of 1988 compared with the last quarter of 1987 stempel said 
he said orders have been strong for the new buick regal 
oldsmobile cutlass supreme and pontiac grand prix midsized coupes 
gm will be cutting underused production capacity so that by 
1992 it approaches 100 percent of the capacity of remaining newer 
more efficient plants to meet expected demand stempel said 
and he said the company will cut its array of models and 
options using more shared components for similarly sized vehicles 
alan smith chief financial officer said gms action plan 
designed to cut costs by 10 billion through efficiency and 
productivity improvements from 19871990 saved 37 billion in 
1987 rather than the 3 billion expected in the first year 
based on our strong costcontainment efforts to date and the 
steps we are now taking our revised outlook for cumulative 1990 
cost savings amounts to between 125 billion and 13 billion 
smith said 
the financial officer said a production facility modernizing 
program is nearly complete and total spending on that will decline 
to about 7 billion this year and 6 billion in 1990 down from 
117 billion in 1986 
stempel said gmunited auto workers union teams are working to 
improve roductivity at gms parts plants with studies expected to 
be completed by september were working very hard with our 
unions on the question of outsourcing noncompetitive products he 
said
