the annual human rights report of the state 
department is particularly severe on china iraq and nicaragua 
according to a copies made available tuesday 
among other abuses the report also recounts floggings in iran 
amputations in saudi arabia and the forced marching of men through 
mine fields in burma 
the report must be submitted each year to the senate foreign 
relations committee and the house foreign affairs committee this 
years covers 1989 
the human rights climate in china deteriorated dramatically in 
1989 the report noted as troops fired on peaceful demonstrators 
in tiananmen square at least several hundred and possibly 
thousands were killed and a drastic countrywide crackdown 
on dissent is still in force 
the report called iraqs record abysmal with freedoms of 
speech and press and of assembly and association virtually 
nonexistent 
other important human rights problems include continuing 
disappearances and arbitrary detentions lack of fair trial 
widespread interference with privacy excessive use of force 
against kurdish civilians and an almost total lack of worker 
rights the department said 
in nicaragua which holds national elections on sunday the 
sandinista government maintains an extensive and repressive 
internal security apparatus 
arbitrary killings are reliably reported both by government 
forces and the contra resistance the report said killings by 
government forces in central nicaragua seem designed to cow the 
local population it said 
both the government and contra leadership prosecuted troops 
accused of murder the report noted and men on both sides were 
sentenced to prison 
among other points 
human rights in territories occupied by israel where the arab 
population is in the 27th month of a rebellion are a source of 
deep concern 
the soviet union has adopted a more forthcoming approach to 
criticism and is improving its human rights record yet the 
liberalization of the country has seen a sharp increase in 
antisemitism not fostered by and even embarrassing to the 
government 
widespread human rights abuses in east germany were being 
changed at years end following the collapse of the hardline 
communist government

the anchorman doesnt look like peter dan or 
tom and doesnt use a teleprompter he looks at the camera and says 
something in russian welcome comrades says the translators 
voiceover 
vremya the soviet evening news program has come to us 
public television more than 100 public broadcasting service 
stations from new york to los angeles are broadcasting vremya 
in a twoweek test begun feb 12 and coordinated by bostons wgbh 
vremya it means time in russian has telegenic 
anchors marina burtseva and kira grigoryeva but lacks the pinball 
graphics and slick electronic packaging of us network news 
grigoryeva sits in front of the logo burtseva before a shelf of 
casually toppled videotape cases they read from their scripts 
glasnost is evident in its workmanlike sovietseye view of the 
upheavals of soviet society in transition such as the ethnic riots 
by hooliganist thugs in tadzhikistan and corruption in labor 
unions 
its like a broadcast you might have found in the 1960s 
said steven weinstock executive producer of the eleventh hour 
late news show on the new york city pbs station wnet his station 
broadcasts vremya at 130 am 
while technically primitive vremya is straightforward in 
presenting the news he said it lacks the entertainment values 
that have crept into us news and it lacks the technical wizardry 
and its refreshing 
it also allows an american audience to see the most popular 
broadcast in the soviet union to see what is driving soviet public 
opinion and get a good sense of what is going on he said 
it has been estimated that 150 million soviet people watch the 9 
pm moscow edition of vremya which would make it the most 
popular tv broadcast in the world if only the soviets had ac 
nielsen co 
in the united states nine of the nations top 10 public tv 
stations are airing vremya said wgbh news director alan 
foster the broadcasters are seeking underwriters for the show 
which foster estimates would cost 1 million a year 
other bigmarket stations participating include los angeles new 
york city san francisco seattle denver chicago minneapolis 
st louis new orleans dallas and washington 
theres not a lot in the deep south and not much of the 
southwest although lubbock texas and las cruces nm are 
running it foster said but otherwise the heartland of america 
has really taken to it as has the big city 
were very excited about it said stella giammasi 
spokeswoman for wnet she said wnet got the show on short notice 
and could schedule it for only 130 am if the experiment 
succeeds wnet could put vremya in prime time 
boston viewers see the show at 430 pm and chicago viewers 
watch it at 1030 pm it even penetrated commercial tv when the 
philadelphia pbs station opted not to use it and wtgi an 
international format uhf station grabbed it instead 
wgbh which solicits viewer mail at the end of the halfhour 
broadcast by friday had more than 100 letters from enthusiastic 
viewers foster said and theres not a single one that says 
this is communist propaganda 
turning vremya into us tv fare makes for a fast day at 
international video broadcasts the virginiabased company that 
captures the early vremya from a soviet satellite each day at 
430 am est 
the signal is altered to us broadcast standards and two ivb 
translators soviet emigres trained at toprated soviet language 
institutes translate the videotape 
we have from 730 am to 115 pm to get it all translated 
edited and dubbed said dick kuiper who is in charge of the 
production he recalled one day last week when they finished with 
just a minute to spare 
television has been mikhail gorbachevs ally in perestroika the 
restructuring of soviet society kuiper said 
i think he specifically chose that medium as a powerful tool 
to get his message to society past all the editors and middle 
managers he said 
the vremya experiment already is a qualified success foster 
said i think it will be a success even if it proves that the 
show may be a good product without a market he added 
so far he said theres been no word from the underwriters 
corporations and foundations that ultimately would bear most of the 
programs cost but wgbh is moving to extend the vremya test 
for two more weeks

ajax delgado snaps his fingers and 
plops his sneakerclad feet on the table the laces are electric 
green 
music he exclaims the campaign needed young music 
on the wall hangs a glossy poster showing two pairs of naked 
thighs pressed together jeans and a rose crumpled on the floor 
its beautiful the first time when you do it with love 
reads the coy slogan 
personally delgado doesnt like the poster 
the guys legs are too skinny he says dismissing it with 
another snap of his fingers 
who is this fasttalking fellow in the black tshirt and the 
tight jeans eating whipped cream cheese with his fingers 
a hip advertising executive a rising record producer 
not quite delgado 28 is secretarygeneral of the sandinista 
youth part of the leftist party that has ruled nicaragua for more 
than a decade 
he is one of the keys to president daniel ortegas effort to 
beat the united national opposition led by violeta barrios de 
chamorro 
clearly things have changed since the days when the sandinista 
youth motto was a dreary marxist study defend produce 
the motto is now plug into the future and the sell is pure 
sex 
the youth vote will be a critical factor in sundays general 
election a third of the 17 million registered voters are between 
the ages of 16 and 25 
delgado is a mastermind of the campaign aimed at selling the 
sandinistas as the fun party the party of the future the hip 
place to be 
its a tall job in a country left shabby and tattered by war a 
us embargo and a devastating economic crisis but delgado is 
convinced the sandinistas have the youth vote wrapped up 
membership in the sandinista youth open to people between the 
ages of 15 and 30 has doubled to 50000 in the past two months he 
says 
delgado laughs off the idea that the sandinistas have 
shamelessly adopted one of the crasser advertising concepts of 
their capitalist nemesis sex sells 
its a sandinista invention he jokes 
the poster with the naked legs and the doubleentendre message 
for firsttime voters is just one of a series of posters featuring 
amorous couples in the youthoriented campaign 
the group has also sponsored beauty contests the feminists 
were critical delgado admits kissing contests dances parties 
and even a valentines day rally at which a member of the nineman 
sandinista directorate got married in the forest of love 
sandinista campaign headquarters bustles with young workers in 
brightly colored tshirts bearing pictures of president ortega and 
other candidates 
young people wear sandinista headbands sandinista tank tops and 
sandinista baseball caps they light up with sandinista lighters 
tote their books in sandinista backpacks and tap their toes to 
sandinista tunes in costenostyle the reggae music from 
nicaraguas atlantic coast 
the slick campaign is no hitormiss affair 
delgado says the sandinista youth prepared by polling young 
people on their likes and dislikes their worries and hopes 
the poll even identified the colors they found most appealing 
delgado says flourishing an armful of tshirts in sky blue 
brilliant green black and gray to demonstrate his point 
fluorescent colors he exclaims they love fluorescent 
colors too 
the study showed that nicaraguan teenagers are a lot like 
teenagers everywhere in many ways they are vain and rebellious 
they are interested in sex and having fun their heroes and role 
models are athletes and musicians 
their concerns however reflect the troubled reality of this 
politically divided and economically crippled nation of 35 
million the war the draft finding a job getting a decent 
education and figuring out how to have a good time in a country 
where the inflation rate was 1700 percent last year 
the sandinista message doesnt dwell on this dreary daily 
reality everything will be better the main campaign slogan 
proclaims 
the sandinistas have been in power since the 1979 revolution 
that toppled the somoza family dictatorship 
the 16yearolds who will be firsttime voters sunday were only 
five when the sandinistas marched triumphantly into managua 
ortega 44 is the only president they have known 
without reliable polls it is impossible to tell if nicaraguas 
young people are buying the partys pitch the way their north 
america contemporaries buy the latest sneakers jeans or recordings 
everybody in the neighborhood belongs to the sandinista 
youth said high school student marta lorena mendoza 18 when 
asked why she belonged 
but it is clear the sandinista effort to lure the youth vote has 
far outstripped that of its main challenger the united national 
opposition 
mrs chamorro unos presidential candidate is a whitehaired 
and aristocratic widow of 60 whose image contrasts sharply with 
that of ortega 
there were rumors her campaign would bring in gloria estefan and 
the miami sound machine but it didnt happen 
before some of her rallies young women danced to a tropical 
beat but it could not equal the sandinista brio and thats not 
what uno is selling anyway 
a 21yearold who said he was proud that he served in the 
sandinista army also said he was going to vote for uno 
its time for a change he said 
meanwhile ortega has shed his customary fatigues and his deadly 
serious often strident manner for the trappings of celebrity he 
stumps the country in flashy sports shirts tossing baseballs 
dancing with constituents and jogging in foot races 
daniel president of the young proclaim the posters and 
billboards daniel is love

the tall men in cowboy boots and western hats 
stalking shoppers in a tokyo meat market were iowa cattlemen 
looking for hints on how to remodel their herds to suit japanese 
tastes 
across town a firm called shop america ltd will soon allow 
japanese to order everything from music to appliances from 
warehouses in new jersey 
difficult though it may be for foreigners to break into the 
japanese market americans see themselves selling tens of millions 
of dollars in goods on the strength of bright ideas quality 
products low prices thorough preparation and government backing 
like the japanese have done for years 
like japan the united states is trying for an economic boost 
through exports and the yenrich japanese consumer is the prime 
target 
this is a huge market the secondbiggest economy in the 
world us ambassador michael armacost said in an interview 
this is an economy where any company in any field that wants to 
be worldclass has got to have a foothold 
many us companies are doing very well in japan armacost 
said but too many still find barriers in local regulations and 
business practices that make it difficult to whittle away at the 
united states 50 billion trade deficit with tokyo 
on thursday us and japanese trade negotiators resume talks 
that aim to change the deeprooted factors in both nations 
economies that contribute to the us trade deficit 
these include japans high savings rate and lower consumption 
high land prices complicated distribution system and corporate 
linkups that tend to leave outsiders in the cold at issue on the 
us side are low savings rates and higher consumption low 
investment the budget deficit and quality of the work force 
the us goal is hoping for more openings to things like shop 
america and us beef those pounding at the door include the us 
retailer toys r us which wants to open big stores in japan but 
is faced with regulations permitting small shops to veto large 
stores nearby 
solomon mester chairman of new yorkbased shop america exults 
in the creation of an atmosphere in japan encouraging sales of us 
goods 
they know they have to import more from the united states 
mester said they know a backlash is building up and they have 
to level the field 
president vernon fraenkel set up shop america with the idea of 
getting the japanese into the us habit of mailorder shopping it 
took more than a year to put together he said and a big problem 
was finding the right japanese partner 
one prospect wanted to stock goods in japan but with high land 
prices it would have been too expensive 
then 711 japan co ltd which has 4000 convenience stores 
came into the picture in august it speedily completed a deal in 
december and expects to open for business nationwide in july 
we had a conservative plan to roll it out suddenly weve got 
a monster with 4000 heads 
the parent company of 711 japan itoyokado co ltd is one of 
the worlds biggest retailers with 12 billion in sales last fiscal 
year 
there are whole teams of people working here on this 
project mester said in an interview at itoyokado headquarters 
shop america will put a computer terminal in each of 711s 
stores customers use a catalog to order small appliances recorded 
music perfume sporting goods watches housewares jewelry and 
other items the barcoded order flashes over a computer network to 
warehouses in new jersey and the goods are sent to japan by mail 
or express delivery 
instead of changing their distribution setup were jumping 
over it mester said 
fraenkel and mester said they set a goal of 20 million in sales 
the first year but 711 japan predicts 70 million 
the shop america executives disbelieve the old saw that the 
japanese wont buy american goods even if theyre cheaper us 
beef is finding ready buyers here at prices sometimes 50 percent 
below the cost of japanese beef 
under pressure from washington japan agreed in 1988 to increase 
its quota on beef imports gradually until 1991 when the import 
limits will be abolished tariffs will be in place until 1994 
if we dont attempt to satisfy this market other parts of the 
world will satisfy it said marshall king chairman of the iowa 
cattlemens association 
king of boone iowa was one of four iowa cattlemen and a meat 
scientist from iowa state university who were exploring japanese 
tastes 
jim bradford of guthrie center iowa vice chairman of the iowa 
beef industry council said the information would help cattle 
breeders plan the right kind of steer for japan a fiveyear 
process 
the iowans visited a fivestory seiyu supermarket where posters 
with iowa gov terry branstads photo beckoned shoppers to try 
iowa quality beef

monday to prepare for a strike in a dispute with state legislators 
centering on salary increases and better benefits 
thousands of teachers spent their presidents day holiday monday 
at a rally in the utah capitol sponsored by the utah education 
association 
we are still negotiating association president jim campbell 
said after a threehour closeddoor meeting monday night with 
members of his board we are still having teachers stay on a 
strike alert but we will not call a strike tomorrow morning 
teachers were told by officials of the union to report as usual 
to classrooms tuesday campbell would not comment further 
state lawmakers following recommendations in republican gov 
norm bangerters 11 billion education budget pumped 12 million 
into textbooks and offered to enable local school districts to 
impose higher property taxes to help relieve classroom overcrowding 
they also promised to dedicate the lions share of a 150 
million 198990 budget surplus to education but remained steadfast 
in offering educators only a 6 percent salary increase the same as 
other public employees and balked at dipping into utahs 48 
million rainy day fund or repealing a tax cut imposed last 
september 
the nearly 16000 members of the education association voted 
3to1 friday to reject the proposed raise they also authorized 
the education associations 16member board to call a strike if 
their demands are not met by the time the republicancontrolled 
legislature adjourns its regular session at midnight wednesday 
teachers want the legislature to increase the amount it 
appropriates for education but have not demanded a specific amount 
utah house speaker nolan karras who has been involved in 
negotiations spoke briefly with campbell on monday and said house 
republicans will consider the situation in caucus tuesday morning 
a strike could affect up to 420000 students and utahs 20000 
teachers 
teachers point to their average salary of about 25000 which 
ranks 41st in the nation they contend utah has the largest class 
sizes in the country and spends the least per student 
the education association called a statewide oneday strike in 
september after the legislature approved a 35 million tax cut but 
no new money for education

this cant really be the oldfashioned 
neighborhood pool hall that mothers warned their sons to stay out 
of 
there at the bottom of the menu is the polite admonition 
shootz cafe is a smokefree environment thank you for not 
smoking 
minnesota fats could shed a few pounds at the shootz a yuppie 
bistro and billiards lounge where the customers chalk their cues 
over california wine spritzers or chow down on gazpacho and a 
heaping antipasto of imported cheeses prosciutto sundried 
tomatoes and artichoke hearts 
this is a clean upscale billiards hall no smoke no 
drunks says coowner ric adamcik its where mothers can tell 
their sons and daughters to go and have a good time in fact you 
can bring your mother along 
a former army brat adamcik remembers sneaking into pool halls 
outside the gates of military bases for a forbidden peek at the 
pinepaneled maleonly world where players sucked on longneck buds 
and jostled with hustlers and bookies over the seductive click and 
thump of billiard balls on green baize 
it was the kind of place where a guy could scratch spit and 
talk dirty all night long without a nagging whine from the missus 
i remember that i didnt want to play in a place that smelled 
like that adamcik said it stank of stale beer and cigarettes 
it was so smoky it made my eyes burn it was full of guys with 
packs of camels rolled up their sleeves and momma tattoos on 
their arms 
the cue racks at the shootz cafe hang on raspberry walls the 
hightech stereo system blasts new wave music earnest young 
professionals in starched buttondowns power ties and wide 
suspenders bend over 14 topoftheline brunswick tables of oak and 
brass 
for that homey feel adamcik says players awaiting their 
turn can relax on leather sofas around a roaring fireplace 
billiards industry officials say the oldtime pool halls are 
dying out they have fallen victim to soaring rents local 
antivice ordinances and staterun lotteries that have lured 
customers away from poolrooms that frequently served as fronts for 
illicit gambling enterprises 
more important the growing affluence of americans has produced 
a dramatic change in the way they spend their leisure time says 
mark cord executive vice president of the billiard congress of 
america the industrys trade association 
people dont want to spend the evening alone in a dingy place 
where theres a lot of drinking and gambling cord said 
families are staying home or going out and doing things together 
smart business owners are making money by appealing to the family 
trade at a respectable place 
cord says an estimated 35 million americans are playing 
billiards regularly a 430 percent boost since the mid1950s that 
makes it the second most popular family sports activity in the 
united states after bowling he says 
the yuppie elegance of the shootz cafe is applauded by such 
billiards greats as willie mosconi and minnesota fats who fondly 
remember the fabulous era of chandeliered salons in new york 
chicago detroit and other cities in the 1920s before poolrooms 
turned into gambling dens during the great depression 
mosconi 76 who lives quietly in suburban philadelphia won 15 
world billiards titles before he retired from tournament play nine 
years ago 
minnesota fats whose real name is rudolph wanderone and was 
portrayed in the movie the hustler by the late jackie 
gleason is over 90 still fat and still shooting pool 
i can beat anybody on earth wanderone said in a telephone 
interview from the nashville tenn hotel where he lives 
tipping the scales at 200 pounds wanderone says his appetite 
knows no bound not even gazpacho and artichoke hearts 
im not a picky eater he said ill eat anything that 
dont bite me first

mikhail s gorbachevs new 
perestroikawithoutperks policy is opening up a harsh new world 
for politburo members who now will have to do without their plush 
country homes or dachas 
the government has decided that the countrys current and former 
leaders except gorbachev and premier nikolai i ryzhkov are no 
longer entitled to privileges such as the dachas and theyve been 
ordered to move out 
valery a sidorov an aide to the chairman of the soviet 
legislatures commission on privileges told the associated press 
monday that the dachas have become a mass insult and their 
occupants will just have to get used to a normal lifestyle 
where once the soviet high and mighty played and sipped vodka 
children will roam sidorov said the country homes are being turned 
over to the soviet health ministry for use as rest homes and 
kindergartens 
as if losing the dachas wasnt enough of a blow retired members 
of the communist partys longruling politburo will also have to do 
without the three household workers and black volga cars the 
government has been providing them virtually free of charge 
sidorov said 
they also will lose the right to order food from special 
government stocks 
the changes are part of a general attack on the perks of the 
soviet elite that under public pressure gorbachev reluctantly 
agreed to endorse only last year 
in a country where shortages of housing food and consumer goods 
are a major source of discontent the network of special stores 
private airports sleek black limousines fancy homes and 
highquality medical care for the government and party elite have 
generated massive public fury 
maverick communist boris n yeltsin built an entire 
parliamentary election campaign on the issue last year and became 
wildly popular because of it 
more radical antiperks movements have swept through eastern 
european countries like east germany and bulgaria where ousted 
communist leaders face prosecution for abuses of power that 
included extravagent living 
in the soviet union regional communist bosses have recently 
lost jobs after being caught amassing luxury goods not available to 
the masses 
most of the soviet leaderships dachas some are believed to 
feature tennis courts and private swimming pools and fountains 
are on the outskirts of moscow and shrouded in secrecy 
they are surrounded by fences and guards and traffic police stop 
anyone venturing close to the secluded dacha rows 
in a reflection of the secrecy sidorov said in a telephone 
interview he did not know how many dachas are affected and he 
declined to provide a complete list of who would have to move out 
he said however that his boss privileges commission chairman 
yevgeny m primakov and politburo member alexander n yakovlev are 
the only people on the current 19person politburo who do not have 
government dachas 
primakovs record however is not untarnished a newspaper 
reported saturday that a special plane arranged for him at one of 
moscows vipsonly airports held up dozens of other flights at 
other airports so the sky could be kept clear for security 
several former politburo members many of them in their 90s 
are believed to live in fancy dachas including holdovers from the 
leonid i brezhnev era such as geidar aliev boris ponomarev and 
peter shelest 
sidorov said many of the former politburo members especially 
ponomarev are not giving up their perks without a fight he said 
ponomarev had sent a protest letter to the commission on privileges 
no deadline for the evictions was set sidorov said 
former residents of the dachas will be offered comparatively 
meager luxuries in return for moving out they will be allowed to 
rent at their own expense country homes run by government 
agencies for a few days a month as well as a government car from a 
fleet for up to 20 hours a month sidorov said 
if they want their own dachas he said they will have to build 
them themselves

natures own cancercausing chemicals that 
are an unavoidable part of everything from pot roast to peanuts 
represent a greater health danger than pesticides and other 
pollutants a health official warns 
a new estimate by the us food and drug administration 
concludes that more than 98 percent of the cancer risk in the diet 
results from ordinary foods not from additives poisons or other 
manmade contributions to the food chain 
the risk is from natural carcinogens in the diet because they 
overwhelm all the others said dr robert j scheuplein director 
of the office of toxicological sciences at the us food and drug 
administration 
this does not mean that all food is dangerous or even that 
people can do much about the hazard instead scheupleins analysis 
was intended to focus attention away from what he sees as a largely 
bogus health issue the hazards of chemical contamination 
dr frank young a former fda commissioner who now is deputy 
assistant secretary of health and human services agreed 
the headline should not be all foods cause cancer or drop 
dead dont eat young said the good news is let us not as a 
nation focus just on the technological food additives we ought to 
focus on the big issues as well 
instead of worrying about the vanishingly small risk of alar in 
apples or dioxin in milk scheuplein said food scientists should be 
exploring ways to remove the important toxins in ordinary foods 
even a modestly effective attempt to lessen the dietary risk 
of natural carcinogens would probably be enormously more useful to 
human health than regulatory efforts devoted to eliminating traces 
of pesticide residues or other specific tracelevel chemicals 
scheuplein said 
he presented his findings monday at a meeting of the american 
association for the advancement of science 
scheuplein based his conclusions on a statistical analysis of 
the quantity of cancercausing toxins found in various parts of the 
diet 
he said that the risk of dying from cancer from dietary exposure 
to all kinds of carcinogens or cancerinducing substances was 77 
percent the risk from traditional foods alone was 76 percent 
most of the risks are peoples personal choices scheuplein 
said they are not imposed on people by corporations apparently 
thats a hard lesson people want to blame somebody 
the clearest cancercausing agent in ordinary food he said is 
fat which has been linked with several kinds of tumors however 
most foods now eaten would not pass safety tests required for new 
food chemicals and additives 
he estimated that carcinogens make up onetenth of 1 percent of 
the food people eat among concerns he cited were 
wellcooked highprotein foods such as meat and eggs contain 
bacterial substances that can cause genetic mutations an ordinary 
days protein can be as damaging to the genes as five cigarettes 
hazardous urethane is a natural product of fermentation it is 
present in beer yogurt bread and other foods 
mycotoxins produced by molds are common in many foods 
especially when stored in warm humid conditions aflatoxins occur 
in corn and peanuts zearalenone in soybeans and luteoskyrin in 
yellow rice 
smoked or salted fish and pickled vegetables may cause 
digestive cancers this is attributed to nitrates and funguses 
grilling and charring fish or meat can produce potentially 
hazardous substances such as nitropyrenes 
many spices contain questionable substances there is estragole 
in tarragon eugenal in cloves cinnamaldehyde in cinnamon 
myristicin in nutmeg and anethole in fennel several spices 
including oregano majoram and bay leaves may cause genetic damage 
other naturally occurring carcinogens include dlimonene in 
oranges psoralens in celery hydrazines in mushroons and nitrates 
in spinach

at least 80 farming operations were paid more 
than the limit of 100000 set by congress under 1988 drought aid 
legislation according to agriculture department records 
the payment list of top recipients under the disaster assistance 
act of 1988 was compiled by the departments agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service 
congress provided 39 billion in aid mostly to help with crop 
losses suffered in the 1988 drought as of dec 31 payments of 
more than 388 billion had been made to 805152 recipients 
agency officials said the list of top payments was sent to the 
office of management and budget which has been reviewing large 
payments to farmers under various commodity and emergency programs 
a copy was made available to the associated press 
were asking for our money back if weve overpaid anybody 
said daniel f shaw ascs deputy administrator for state and county 
operations the computers are set to flag anybody that goes over 
the 100000 limit even by a dollar 
agency rules are flexible when it comes to some kinds of farm 
operations however including joint ventures and family 
partnerships 
shaw was asked about the biggest payment on the 1988 list 
380092 to the bureau of indian affairs in minnesota 
theyre a joint venture so they didnt go over the 100000 
limit he said thats for an indian tribe and an indian tribe 
is a joint venture so every indian in that tribe is entitled to 
the 100000 limit its almost impossible for an indian tribe to 
violate 
another leeway is provided in a family partnership which 
could be made up of four people in a family shaw said each 
one is eligible for 100000 
but the ascs computer operation in kansas city mo tracks 
other possible violations including identical or similar 
addresses particularly if used by different individuals 
single names bother me shaw said they should come up 
flagged and well be asking for our money back if theres a 
violation 
if all other conditions are met properly the agency is likely 
to ask only for the amount in excess of the 100000 limit in some 
cases however the farmer might have to return the entire amount 
not all blame can be put on the farmer if a payment is out of 
line agency officials admit mistakes are made in administering the 
program and some overpayments can be the result of usda errors but 
thats one reason for checking out the payments 
the agency stepped up its review of drought payments after a 
series of associated press stories in december showed widespread 
misapplication of funds in the 39 billion 1988 relief program 
last month the ascs said it was checking specific misdeeds 
spotted by the ap in its sevenmonth study of drought payments in 
22 counties in eight states 
the issue of large subsidies to farmers under the usdas annual 
commodity programs and the drought payments is part of a developing 
controversy in congress over federal crop insurance and disaster 
payments 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter says its too expensive to 
have both and congress will have to choose between an overhaul of 
federal crop insurance or abandoning it in favor of permanent 
disaster aid 
rep kika de la garza dtexas chairman of the house 
agriculture committee who defends the drought aid program because 
of its emergency nature said last week that the bush 
administration is forcing our hand into enacting reforms 
about half of the top 80 payment recipients exceeded the 
100000 limit by less than 100 each according to the list 
provided to the ap overall the 80 recipients were concentrated in 
montana 15 michigan 9 south dakota 9 illinois 8 texas 6 
and wisconsin 6 
in addition to those getting more than 100000 in payments the 
list included more than 600 others who received exactly 100000 
under the 1988 drought program

people may not recognize the 
faces but the names of the two former contras are part of the 
mythology of the mountains 
which one is dumas a woman asks in the bustle of sunday 
market which one is rigoberto 
this is contra country many families have collaborated with the 
usbacked rebel force losing sons husbands brothers 
sweethearts to nicaraguas fratricidal war 
rigoberto tirzo moreno dumas cesar chavarria fernando 
diogenes hernandez and licenciado victor sanchez led those men 
into battle until they were ousted from the contras in may 1988 
now they are back trying to persuade rebel fighters to lay down 
their arms helping the leftist sandinista government make its case 
for demobilization arguing that next sundays elections mean there 
is no longer any need for the contras to fight 
chontales province is a rugged cattle region and these wary men 
and women of los chinamos in their boots and cowboy hats and spurs 
are a tough audience 
the pouring rain turns into a drizzle the road melts into a 
slippery ribbon of red mud still people gather when the former 
comandantes climb onto the back of a truck in the middle of town 
some residents are confounded by the sight of the former contras 
swooping in aboard a sandinista air force helicopter then standing 
side by side with government soldiers 
why arent they in honduras one man mutters as he moves 
under an eave to escape the chilly mistlike rain how did they 
get here 
rigoberto fernando licenciado and dumas have been living in 
the united states since being forced out in one of the more 
notorious internal battles that have bedeviled the contras 
they were deported from honduras where the rebels are based 
after telling the cia they believed thenchief of staff enrique 
bermudez was corrupt and demanding a change the next thing they 
knew they were on a plane to miami 
all four deny any sandinista government role in their return to 
nicaragua they say they came back on the eve of general elections 
because they believe nicaragua is finally moving toward democracy 
in the governments eagerness to see the contras disbanded the 
sandinistas advanced the elections nine months and opened the 
political process 
most of the opposition has united behind publisher violeta 
barrios de chamorros challenge to president daniel ortega in 
sundays elections 
despite the new political openness however few contra fighters 
have come down from the mountains the only activeduty comandante 
to lay down his arms luis adan fley says the four are letting 
themselves be used by the sandinistas fley has returned for the 
elections but refuses to have anything to do with his former 
comrades 
the sandinista expedition included santiago murey and franco 
vicente of the united nationsorganization of american states 
commission to demobilize the contras 
the trip to los chinamos 100 miles east of managua is their 
first foray into the countryside 
trial by fire murey says as he climbs onto the truck bed 
he and vicente tell the crowd that contras who demobilize will 
not face sanctions or harassment standing in drenched shirts they 
invite questions 
no one speaks up 
then rigoberto steps forward ignoring a loudspeaker as he looks 
down on a sea of impassive peasant faces 
were here so young men wont keep dying in this land of lakes 
and volcanos he says the time has come to put an end to this 
war 
he insists that the elections represent real change a big step 
on the road to democracy on the road to the cause for which they 
fought so long 
there is no justification for staying in the mountains 
rigoberto says 
a man steps forward and asks what the four former comandantes 
can do to end the war since they no longer have contact with the 
contras 
were going to make contact here rigoberto replies they 
should negotiate their own fate their own life without an 
intermediary 
later they work the crowd like politicians grabbing arms 
shaking hands slapping backs threading their way among mules 
laden with cheeses 
rigoberto and his companions then clamber up a steep muddy 
hillside they set up a radio stringing an antenna to the tallest 
tree 
they roam the frequencies calling out to former comrades in 
arms as 10 sandinista soldiers look on 
rigoberto makes contact 
were not here to surrender anyone he says we were in 
the mountains for seven years were here looking for a solution 
the radio crackles back 
i know you rigoberto a voice says 
a wave of static washes out his next words then the voice comes 
through loud and clear 
we dont want anyone here who sells out his homeland we want 
men here with convictions and guts you dogs

authorities hunting for clues in two grocery 
store bombings said monday they hoped for help from a 
securitycamera videotape of people entering and leaving one of the 
stores 
we have no leads at all said police chief jerry king at 
this point we have no motive 
the saturday bombings spurred copycat bomb threats monday 
including one that prompted the evacuation of north fulton regional 
hospital in roswell around 935 pm said police dispatcher 
charles tyson no bombs had been found by late in the evening 
the bombs at a kroger and a cub foods store in this wealthy 
suburb about 20 miles north of atlanta misfired no one was injured 
and only minor damage was done 
both stores had been warned about the bombs by an anonymous 
caller the kroger store was evacuated but about 100 shoppers in 
the cub foods store ignored the warning and were shopping when the 
bomb detonated 
the videotape was made at the kroger store as a matter of 
routine because a bank is inside the store king said he said 
investigators would review the tape for any suspiciouslooking 
people 
the two bombs were basically identical king said 
it was not a pipe bomb it wasnt anything that 
sophisticated he said 
the detonators fired but did not trigger large explosions fbi 
spokesman pat johnson said 
fbi and federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms agents 
met monday with police to discuss the case atf spokesman tom 
stokes said officials could release no further information 
stokes said sunday the devices apparently were not built by 
whoever made powerful bombs that killed a federal judge in alabama 
and a lawyer in georgia in december 
investigators have found absolutely no connection between the 
grocery bombings and the nailfilled mail bombs that killed judge 
robert vance of the 11th us circuit court of appeals in mountain 
brook ala and attorney robert robinson of savannah ga stokes 
said 
 
but fulton county youth investigator steve rose said federal 
investigators would receive information on a 16yearold sandy 
springs youth who purchased materials to make a bomb three days 
before the explosions 
well pass what we have along to them and let them decide what 
they want to do about it he said 
police said they have no evidence that would indicate that the 
youth was connected to saturdays bombs 
rose said a sales clerk at c and c hardware co told police the 
teenager purchased copper pipe end caps and two boxes of kitchen 
matches wednesday at the store 
the youth also asked the sales clerk where he could buy aluminum 
pipe and wood alcohol and said he planned to make a bomb rose said 
rose said the sales clerk got the license number of the car the 
boy was driving and gave it to police

usually its a little difficult to feel 
sympathetic with manon in the second act of manon lescaut 
after leaving her student lover she lives luxuriously in paris 
with the elderly geronte even when geronte finds out hes been 
twotimed and sends for the police she delays flight to gather up 
her jewels 
but mirella freni sang manon with such depth of emotion such 
phrasing and nuance such exquisitely held notes that one melts 
before her singing puccinis beautiful melodies about true love 
the metropolitan opera orchestra conducted by nello santi 
sounded wonderful in the first manon lescaut of the season the 
opera was last heard at the met in the 198687 season this 
production is by desmond heeley 
tenor peter dvorsky of czechoslovakia sang the young lover des 
grieux in act 1 he was without subtlety blaring from soft to 
loud later dvorsky sounded much better his tone didnt become 
magnificent but it became more of one piece 
j patrick raftery who has sung at the paris opera and lyric 
opera of chicago among other places was making his met debut as 
manons brother he wasnt projecting in act 1 and he also was 
better later in the opera his is the kind of baritone voice that 
remains focused never spreading all over the tones 
act 1 in general looked and sounded underrehearsed 
italo tajo was very good as the elderly geronte in act 1 
though he sounded appropriately aged his singing came through the 
best of the male principals

efforts to predict the effects of global 
warming are being hurt by lack of access to 40 years of secret 
soviet and us military data on the north polar ice cap 
scientists said 
submarine sonar measurements of the thickness of the ice cap are 
crucial to understanding ocean currents underneath the ice cap 
said michael schlesinger of oregon state university 
those currents must be understood if researchers are to predict 
accurately the rate of warming of the earths climate as carbon 
dioxide is released into the atmosphere schlesinger said monday at 
the annual meeting of the american association for the advancement 
of science 
what i want is month by month the thickness of sea ice 
which you can only get by submarine schlesinger said 
soviet military planners have the same data on the north polar 
ice cap that american military officials have schlesinger said 
but his soviet colleagues have told him they cannot get the secret 
data 
satellite measurements of the monthly changes in the size of the 
ice cap are available but the satellites cannot be used to measure 
the ices thickness he said 
schlesinger is one of a small number of researchers developing 
computer programs to simulate the effect of global warming and 
predict its future consequences 
such models need data on ocean currents to make accurate 
predictions he said there are five such models in the united 
states and the same number in the soviet union he said 
all the models have run with some assumption of this missing 
term under the ice he said 
syukuro manabe another developer of such models said the ocean 
can absorb a lot of the heat produced as increasing amounts of 
carbon dioxide in the air trap more and more of the suns heat 
researchers said they do not yet know exactly how much heat the 
oceans can absorb 
the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is expected to 
double by the first half of the next century but the associated 
warming will probably lag by several decades because at first the 
heat will be lost into the oceans said manabe a researcher at a 
national oceanic and atmospheric administration laboratory at 
princeton university in new jersey 
the eventual temperature rise is expected to be an average of 2 
degrees to 4 degrees around the world the researchers said 
manabe hopes the abatement of the cold war will help 
globalwarming researchers 
im hoping that this will be one of the peace dividends he 
said that the us and the soviets will exchange sea ice data

the sandinista government says nine 
people were killed in clashes with contra rebels over the past 
week but international observers are noting a lull in political 
violence as general elections near 
the foreigners say they expect sundays potentially pivotal 
balloting to be peaceful free and fair 
over the last two weeks we had been rather worried about 
possible violence iqbal riza of pakistan local head of the 
united nations mission to observe the elections said monday 
over the last few days the tone has been lowered he said 
and we are noticing a willingness by each party to avoid 
violence 
tension had shot up over the past two weeks as the leftist 
sandinistas and their main challenger the usbacked united 
national opposition coalition exchanged threats of violence 
president daniel ortega seeking another sixyear term 
threatened to close the newspaper published by coalition 
presidential candidate violeta barrios de chamorro and confiscate 
her house if the sandinistas win 
he also threatened to seize the home of its vice presidential 
candidate virgilio godoy 
godoy had threatened to make the sandinistas pay the bill 
an ominous nicaraguan expression that can imply anything including 
death 
both threats came in campaign speeches but both sides have 
since toned down their rhetoric 
as riza was speaking at a news conference at the foreign 
correspondents club in managua the defense ministry issued a 
communique on the clashes with the usbacked contras 
th onepage statement said sandinista troops fought contras in 
chontales province in the south on wednesday and friday and in 
nueva segovia province in the north on sunday 
it said five rebels died in the clashes it did not report any 
army casualties 
the defense ministry also accused the contras of ambushing and 
killing four peasants in the northern province of jinotega on week 
ago and of kidnapping a civilian in the south atlantic autonomous 
region on sunday it said one of the peasants killed in jinotega 
was a sandinista front militant 
the four jinotega victims were buried monday in the town of 
esteli 
the sandinistas have repeatedly accused the contras of 
intimidating and killing sandinista supporters in the countryside 
the contras have denied it 
figures obtained by the associated press show managua the 
capital and one of the big question marks in the election 
represents the largest single chunk of registered voters nationwide 
a final tally of voters registered in nicaraguas nine regions 
show managua has 462446 registered voters out of a national total 
of 1750550 or 2642 percent of the vote 
many public employees and members of the armed forces live in 
managua an advantage for the sandinistas in the voting 
but the urban poor and managua is by far the largest urban 
center in nicaragua have suffered the most from a ravaged economy 
that the opposition blames on sandinista mismanagement and the 
sandinistas blame on the us economic embargo in effect since 1985 
and years of war with the contras 
the rebels began fighting the sandinista government in 1981 two 
years after the revolution that toppled dictator anastasio somoza 
in february 1988 the us congress cut off military aid to the 
contras who are based in neighboring honduras 
president bush has said he wanted nonlethal aid to continue to 
the contras to ensure that the sandinistas hold free elections

farm organizations are skeptical about the 
bush administrations refusal to spell out precisely what it wants 
in new farm legislation regarding price supports and target prices 
some members of congress arent pleased about the footdragging 
either at a hearing of the senate agriculture committee on feb 7 
chairman patrick leahy dvt challenged agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter 
we cant write a farm bill without an idea of what the 
administration wants leahy said i want specifics 
but yeutter continued to stonewall the administration will 
not declare today what its position is on target prices he added 
that talks on spending ought to take place in private rather than 
in a public hearing 
yeutter had another opportunity to provide more details at a 
hearing today before the house agriculture committee and chairman 
kika de la garza dtexas but there wasnt much expectation he 
would get into more specifics than he did with leahy 
meanwhile the administrations fuzziness about target prices 
rates upon which crop deficiency payments to farmers are based 
has prompted doubting stares and a few fiery glances from farm 
groups 
the american farm bureau federation which has been relatively 
placid about administration policies says it isnt satisfied by 
the bush farm bill proposals so far 
failure to address target price levels is the largest question 
mark that we have in our minds said federation policy specialist 
rob nooter thats going to be a very important element of 
putting together a new farm bill how much income support do we 
include 
the federation favors freezing target prices at their 1990 
levels but without an answer from the administration its 
obvious that congress is going to have to make that decision in 
negotiations with the bush people nooter said 
at the heart of the bush plan is flexibility so farmers can 
have more choice as to what crops to plant under annual commodity 
programs the basic idea appears to have strong acceptance among 
some farm groups although its not unanimous 
the national grange said the 1990 farm bill proposals announced 
by yeutter on feb 6 would as expected lead to policies the 
administration believes will be more oriented to market signals 
instead of government regulation 
notably absent from the proposals are specific recommendations 
for target prices for the governments crop programs the grange 
said also absent was any mention of the proposals to eliminate 
farm subsidy payments to this nations largest wealthiest farmers 
and to tighten farm subsidy payment limits that were part of 
president bushs recent 1991 budget message to congress 
in his budget proposal to congress on jan 29 bush said the 
administration will work closely with lawmakers to close loopholes 
in federal subsidy restrictions and to eliminate excessive 
payments to wealthy farmers 
the grange said the administrations proposals include features 
that are both supported and opposed by its members 
conservation trade research and grain storage proposals are 
close to grange objectives but flexibility dairy and the 
administrations plan to kill federal crop insurance are at odds 
with current grange policy 
the national farmers unions appraisal of bush farm bill 
strategy was characterized by nfu president leland swenson as a 
house with no foundation it may look good from the outside but 
you soon realize something pretty important is missing 
yet the administrations general blueprint has some features 
the nfu finds appealing 
many of the recommendations closely follow those called for in 
the farm bill proposal we announced last july swenson said 
but recommending changes in planting decisions setaside 
determinations loan rate and the like without any consideration 
of farm income levels is shortsighted at best 
the strongest appraisal of administration proposals came from 
the national farm coalition which says it is made up of 40 
grassroots farm organizations from across the united states 
secretary yeutters guidelines for a 1990 farm bill are just a 
continuation of the 1985 farm bill a disaster for farmers 
taxpayers rural communities and the environment said ralph 
nodland a north dakota grain farmer and president of the coalition 
nodland said the administration plan would further reduce 
farmers income by keeping farm prices low he said the 
flexibility concept actually amounts to an option to keep cutting 
prices

leftist guerrillas freed an american 
priest monday night who had been kidnapped in protest of president

the priest francis amico ferrari 43 said in a live radio 
interview that he was released unharmed in the western colombia 
city of cali 
the radio network caracol which carried the interview reported 
that amico ferrari is from houston other priests in his parish in 
cali had said last week that amico ferrari is from rochester ny 
in cartagena a caribbean port city where president bush met 
with three latin presidents last thursday guerrillas dynamited an 
electric power substation monday night and attacked three police 
posts police there told the associated press five police officers 
were wounded and much of the city of 530000 people was left 
without power the police said 
the national liberation army claimed responsibility for the 
attack the policeman said speaking on condition of anonymity 
the group kidnapped amico ferrari thursday morning in cali while 
on his way to his church in a slum neighborhood 
the guerrillas also kidnapped two other american citizens last 
week to protest bushs visit and they remained in the hands of the 
group which is led by a former priest manuel perez 
those two james donnelly of detroit and david kent of 
indianapolis were kidnapped last tuesday in the northwestern city 
of medellin 
amico ferrari said after being released that he had been 
lectured by the guerrillas on the need to nationalize foreign oil 
holdings in colombia latin americas foreign debt and rightwing 
death squads 
the colombian attorney generals office says rightwing death 
squads have killed hundreds of leftists in colombia in the last 
five years 
amico ferrari said the leader of the guerrillas who kidnapped 
him was polite and intelligent and treated him with respect the 
priest said he was treated well during his five days of captivity 
amico ferrari is the superior of a parish in cali that is in one 
of that citys poorest neighborhoods he founded the basilian 
priests branch in the neighborhood san andres after arriving in 
colombia in 1987 
the national liberation army issued a communique through 
colombian news media friday claiming that the kidnappings were in 
protest of bushs visit 
the communique accused the united states of trying to impose its 
will on colombia 
the associated press obtained a copy of the communique which 
declared gringos out el salvador and colombia will win 
the national liberation army was organized in the mid1970s and 
has followed the ideology of cubas fidel castro 
there are an estimated 10000 guerrillas in six groups in 
colombia the national liberation army has become the most active 
of the six in the last four years blowing up oil pipelines 
ambushing army patrols attacking military bases kidnapping people 
and attacking small towns to destroy police stations and rob banks 
one colombian guerrilla group the april 19 movement named 
after the date of a presidential election in 1970 has signed a 
peace treaty with the government four other groups say they also 
are interested in peace talks 
the national liberation army has vowed to fight on however

pssst can you keep a secret the census 
bureau can 
the same people who churn out a seemingly endless supply of 
details about americans in general will reveal nothing about 
individuals 
urging people to answer the census bureau director barbara e 
bryant stresses their responses are completely confidential 
the answers are not shared with any other government agency or 
individual they are combined into statistics with individual 
information kept private until the year 2062 she says 
confidentiality was not always the rule two centuries ago 
copies of the census lists were posted in public places so people 
could point out omissions and errors 
but today individual privacy is both policy and law and the 
census bureau has compiled an enviable record of protecting the 
information people provide 
for example even during the hysteria following the bombing of 
pearl harbor in 1941 the bureau refused to release the names and 
addresses of japaneseamericans living on the west coast 
it also turned down the attorney generals demand for 
information about individuals suspected of being communists during 
a red scare in 1947 
and in 1980 the bureau refused to comply with a federal court 
order demanding addresses for certain city officials 
in turning down the court bureau officials said even releasing 
information on the number of people living in various apartments 
could harm individuals by revealing those doublingup or by 
disclosing the presence of squatters welfare fathers illegal 
aliens and others 
confidentiality is especially stressed in promotion efforts 
directed at the hispanic community where many people may be in the 
country illegally and those who are legal often distrust 
government officials 
the law requires the bureau to count all the people in the 
nation not just citizens so it makes a special effort to reach 
those who are reluctant to be included 
hence the emphasis that information given the census is not 
passed on to the immigration and naturalization service or the 
internal revenue service or the selective service or anyone else 
names and addresses of individuals are collected to make sure no 
one is missed or counted twice but they are not recorded in the 
giant computers which compile and sort the census information 
officials say 
those machines merely digest the information about people living 
on particular blocks or census tracts across the nation and 
provide that information for a variety of statistical uses 
in cases where even releasing those statistics would reveal 
something about an individual the numbers are kept private 
for example the 1980 census found 2315 people living in census 
tract 20 of kansas city including one black person 
normally data such as income type of residence employment and 
so forth is released by race 
but not in this tract because it would have been obvious who 
was being reported on indeed the bureau suppresses data unless a 
large number of people are averaged out so that no one can learn 
about an individual or family or small group 
census bureau employees who reveal information about individuals 
are subject to a 5000 fine and five years in prison but no one 
has ever been convicted of releasing such data 
only after 72 years does the information on individuals become 
public record then it is made available at the national archives 
for people doing research on their ancestors that means individual 
data from the 1920 census will become available in two years 
the only use of census data permitted earlier is for individuals 
who request information to prove their age this often is needed to 
qualify for pension benefits or for some other purpose when birth 
certificates or other documents have been lost 
the legal confidentiality of the census was instituted in 1910 
to protect information on businesses and in 1930 that was extended 
to cover the general population 
privacy was apparently not a consideration in 1790 when the 
first us census was taken the us marshals who took that census 
posted their lists in public a practice that continued until 1830

congress is mobilizing for the possibility 
that large numbers of troops will be mustered out as a result of 
growing world peace 
at least two lawmakers have introduced proposals providing a 
khaki parachute to soften the landing of soldiers into civilian 
life and a law that took effect in january could lay the 
groundwork for making readjustment easier 
among the measures 
legislation introduced by rep thomas j downey dny to 
restore unemployment compensation benefits to exmilitary personnel 
to the same number of weeks available to civilians 
veterans now must wait four weeks to start 13 weeks of benefits 
instead of one week to start 26 weeks of benefits the current 
formula for veterans dates back to the beginning of the 1980s when 
an effort was made to cut off eligibility altogether 
in an era when we are cutting defense spending at the same 
time we expect our fighting men and women to risk their lives in 
grenada and panama the least we can do is provide them with 26 
weeks of benefits after the coming reduction in force downey 
said 
a bill introduced by rep jim slattery dkan that would 
entitle enlisted personnel and noncommissioned officers to 
separation pay if they have completed five or more years of active 
duty before being involuntarily discharged officers already 
receive up to 30000 in severance pay slattery said 
many men and women join the service expecting to spend their 
entire career serving their country slattery said i think 
that it is unfair for the government to release them without some 
kind of compensation 
an estimate prepared by the private non commissioned officers 
association says the cost would be 58 million to 105 million 
depending on when in the fiscal year the soldiers are separated 
the ncoa says that money would be offset by savings of 126 
million in unemployment compensation those 5000 officers were 
earning 96 million a month the estimate says 
a package of veterans benefits legislation that was enacted 
late last year set up a pilot program to provide employment and 
training services to members of armed forces preparing to leave 
oddly enough this was not in anticipation of the budget or 
events in europe said john v meyers deputy assistant secretary 
of labor for veterans employment and training however the 
timing of the pilot program couldnt be better 
the program now is borrowing staff from other functions a 
report on the operations is due in may 1992 but meyers says 
largescale troop reductions could hasten full implementation 
the program helps members of the military within 180 days of 
leaving the service the help includes economic profiles of 
regions wage rates in areas resume preparation and help in 
applying skills acquired in the military to civilian jobs 
the pilot program is underway at camp pendleton calif for 
marines san antonio texas for the air force norfolk va and 
jacksonville fla for the navy and ft benning ga and ft 
eustis va for the army programs for disabled personnel are at 
san antonio for the air force jacksonville for the navy and 
fitzsimmons army hospital colo 
meantime the department of veterans affairs says it expects a 
large new wave of veterans to have little impact on its ability to 
deliver services most of the veterans are relatively young and 
healthy so they should place little demand on the health care and 
compensation system said spokesman bonner day 
day said he expected an increase in applications for the gi 
bill which provides payments for college or other posthigh school 
education 
but some veterans groups say the system already is strapped as 
a result of tight budgets and the biggest problem is with the time 
it takes to handle benefits applications 
employees who handle the gi bill they say are working to ease 
the backlog in other areas discharged soldiers who fall upon hard 
times may try to resurrect old injuries in order to get veterans 
compensation worsening the logjam the groups say

this is a story of three brothers the 
oldest is mayor of new haven the youngest rose to the rank of a 
police detective the middle one descended into the world of drug 
addiction and was charged this month with being a pusher 
on feb 6 the 37th day of mayor john daniels first term of 
office in this southern connecticut city of 127000 and 10 days 
before detective melvin daniels was to put in for retirement the 
lives of the three brothers were changed forever 
robert daniels 48 surrendered to melvin to answer cocaine 
possession and trafficking charges and the mayor was put on the 
spot to explain how brothers could be so different 
few suggest that john daniels 53 new havens first black 
mayor will lose his position as a role model for this citys black 
youth or see his relentless antidrug message undermined 
as melvin daniels the youngest of the brothers at age 45 put 
it you cant be held responsible for an almost 50yearold man 
weli radio host steve kalb said that when he wondered out loud 
whether the mayor should have kept closer tabs on his brother i 
got jumped on mostly callers expressed sorrow over the turn of 
events 
a former city alderman state senator and businessman the 
softspoken nattily dressed john daniels established an 
unblemished record of public service as he kept his sights on the 
mayors office for more than 20 years 
but while johns fortunes were rising roberts were falling 
the mayor said roberts problems began in the late 1970s when 
he got laid off from his bluecollar job and got mixed up with the 
wrong crowd family members efforts to help met with little 
success one stay in a residential treatment program had no lasting 
effect 
when robert daniels was arraigned this month he listed no 
assets and was granted a courtappointed attorney 
some people just take a lot longer than others to hit 
bottom said melvin 
robert who was using the alias of dan daniels allegedly sold 
cocaine to an undercover officer on two occasions a warrant was 
issued for his arrest following a raid on his apartment that netted 
7500 worth of cocaine when robert gave himself up to his brother 
four days after the raid it was his first arrest 
according to a court source he entered a 28day drug treatment 
program at connecticut valley hospital in middletown three days 
after his arrest no trial date has been set 
the brothers have gotten together only occasionally for holidays 
and family birthdays although robert did stop by for johns 
victory party nov 7 
melvin who has spent the last five years on the front lines of 
new havens escalating drug war is trying to forget the day he 
faced off against his brother in that battle 
i dont want to keep on opening it up said the police 
detective whose nickname is rock i want to let that thing 
die 
let me put it simply for you he said its part of the 
territory of being a police officer even though it hurts 
sometimes you do what you got to do 
john daniels jr is the oldest of the three sons and two 
daughters of john and ludelia daniels who were on hand to watch 
him sworn in as mayor the family moved from georgia to new haven 
when john jr was a young boy 
a star football player in high school john attended villanova 
university on a full athletic scholarship his first job was as a 
teacher and he later worked for qunnipiac college yale university 
and a city development agency 
melvin entered the navy after high school and worked as a 
mechanic before becoming a housing authority police officer in 
1969 he is sort of a carbon copy of john said albert rogers 
the mayors executive assistant and friend since grammar school 
he just went out and did his job 
robert who has two daughters but is separated from his wife 
was always a very lovable and happygolucky guy said melvin 
in his 1960 high school yearbook robert listed dancing as his 
favorite hobby and entry into the air force as his ambition melvin 
said his brother did go on to join the air force but eventually 
received a medical discharge because of asthma 
in the black community sympathy was expressed for roberts 
family 
i have compassion and support for his family because i know 
what it feels like said lisa sullivan a yale graduate student 
and political activist who advises the naacp youth council i 
have cousins and uncles in my family who sell drugs and are 
addicted to drugs the black community is in crisis 
the mayor told a news conference on feb 7 that if the fact 
that the mayors brother can fall prey to the lure of drugs will 
help the rest of the community realize that it can happen in any 
family to any one then something good has come of roberts 
tragedy

the job pays 93432 a year but seven 
candidates for governor already have spent more than 20 million 
trying to land it and analysts say the final tab could hit 50 
million 
the bulk of the money is going for production and broadcast of 
television commercials exposure thats mandatory for reaching the 
states 17 million residents 
texas is so large that to blanket it a candidate must purchase 
air time on more than 70 stations in 21 tv markets including 
outlets in arkansas louisiana and oklahoma 
campaign costs are going up because of television and postage 
the television advertising is so expensive and the markets are so 
numerous it costs a ton to run for office said george 
christian political consultant and former press secretary to 
president lyndon johnson 
its unfortunate he said but its a fact of life in 
texas 
four republicans and three democrats are vying for nominations 
in the march 13 primaries to succeed retiring gov bill clements 
the states only republican governor in 100 years 
top spender is the man who according to polls is the leader in 
the republican primary field millionaire oilman clayton williams 
he has spent 64 million more than 4 million of it from his 
personal bank account and first aired television commercials in 
august 
state treasurer ann richards who leaped to national attention 
by keynoting the 1988 democratic convention leads in democratic 
race polls but lags in fundraising at 21 million 
the democratic financial lead goes to attorney general jim 
mattox who raised more than 4 million and spent 37 million 
including almost 2 million on television ads in the past month 
alone 
former gov mark white who raised 3 million since joining the 
democratic race in november 
according to campaign finance reports filed by all candidates 
spending on the race totaled 201 million by feb 12 and that was 
with a month left until the primary and two months until the 
expected runoff elections 
analysts in both parties have said that by november the race 
will easily eclipse the state record 335 million spent in 1986 
when clements ousted white 
williams defends his spending as proof of his independence from 
special interests 
clayton is not beholden to anybody some people consider that 
an asset to be able to contribute to your own campaign said 
williams aide scott bohnenkamp 
williams gop opponents accuse him of trying to buy the 
republican nomination 
referring to williams cowboy image and two admitted fist fights 
since he turned 50 a spokeswoman for gop hopeful tom luce 
retorted i dont know how tough clayton is but he has a black 
belt in spending 
asked about soaring campaign costs mark sanders press 
secretary to republican candidate kent hance said television 
advertising its just that simple hance a former boll 
weevil democratic congressman who changed parties in 1985 has 
raised 22 million recent polls put him second in the gop race 
candidates say collecting money takes more work than it used to 
since the states oil and real estate busts 
i dont believe theyre stealing any but they do have to beg 
and borrow christian said 
its really hurtful to campaigns because it means they have to 
be devoted primarily to raising money to get their message out on 
tv its not just the candidate everybody is hustling for money 
and theyre hustling against great competition right now there 
are legislative races local races he said 
mattox was criticized for raising money from law firms while 
serving as attorney general but his strategy of banking money 
early has let him outspend the other democrats as election day 
nears 
theres a time to reap and a time to sow said mattox 
spokesman kelly fero we reaped early and now were sowing we 
still have more to spend and the bulk of it is of course on tv 
ms richards who raised funds with the help of celebrities such 
as lily tomlin and marlo thomas has frontrunner status to help 
offset her smaller bank account christian said 
because shes ahead and seems to have a fairly strong base of 
support they didnt have to spend as much money early he 
said they have squirreled their money away for the end and will 
hit the television with a pretty heavy buy when youre ahead you 
can do that 
glenn smith ms richards campaign manager said that while her 
21 million is less than mattoxs war chest or whites the bulk 
of it came from small contributors not regular political backers

the dollar held steady against the yen tuesday 
while the key index on the tokyo stock exchange continued its fall 
the dollar closed at 14458 yen up 006 yen from its daybefore 
level of 14452 yen it traded narrowly throughout the day after 
its 14450yen opening ranging between 14445 yen and 14465 yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average which lost 23772 points 
monday shed an additional 32708 points or 08 percent to end 
the day at 3689552 trading was said to be light at about 330 
million shares 
brokers attributed the stock markets loss to persistent fears 
of another rise in the bank of japans official discount rate the 
rate charged to banks which now stands at 425 percent following 
three increases last year 
dealers said the speculation was reinforced when the central 
bank released figures in the afternoon showing that japans money 
supply grew by 115 percent in january from a year earlier it was 
the second straight month of doubledigit money growth a sign of 
inflation and a rise from decembers growth of 106 percent 
bank of japan governor yasushi mieno has warned repeatedly about 
the threat of inflation especially in light of recent higher oil 
prices and the yens persistent weakness that has been pushing up 
import costs 
if money supply growth is high then the possibility of a 
discount rate hike increases explained a dealer at a japanese 
securities firm who spoke on condition of anonymity he said he 
doubted any increase would come right away 
chris schreiber a trader with new japan securities co said 
you also have selling pressures ahead of yearend settlements in 
march the japanese fiscal year ends march 31 
other negative factors schreiber pointed to included an 
oversupply of convertible bonds coming onto the market earnings 
disappointments and concerns about a slowdown in the us economy 
basically there are no new buying incentives he said

us officials are warning that war and bad 
weather are causing new and immediate hunger emergencies in western 
africa 
the officials say antigovernment forces in ethiopia have shut 
down a port that is a key entry point for food assistance 
threatening the lives of up to 5 million ethiopians severely 
diminished harvests because of poor rainfall in northern ethiopia 
are further aggravating the situation 
us officials say a crisis situation is also rapidly developing 
in the sudan where a bitter civil war is preventing the transport 
of relief supplies to rebelheld territory in the southern part of 
the country 
president bush sent a letter to the sudanese president last week 
asking for his cooperation in restarting the international relief 
effort to which the united states contributes 157 million 
renewed fighting has led to the suspension of food flights to 
southern sudan and the government is preventing the departure of a 
relief train along a route where food shortages are severe the 
rebels also have been blocking relief efforts 
estimates are that 1 million to 3 million sudanese could suffer 
from famine 
in ethiopia the cutoff of relief supplies through massawa a 
deep water port on the red sea affects the eritrea and tigray 
provinces and portions of three other provinces 
the next six weeks to two months is the critical time said 
andrew natsios director of the office of foreign disaster 
assistance were trying to explore options for getting the food 
in 
he added that a worst nightmare scenario is developing a 
civil war and a famine in the same area at the same time 
a western relief official told the washington post if the 
port is closed for any length of time then there is the 
possibility of tragedy n northern ethiopia 
the situation evokes memories of the 198485 period in ethiopia 
when more than a million people died primarily because of drought 
renewed drought last year in ethiopia touched off a major 
international relief program led by the united states and the 
european community both of which funnel food donations through 
private voluntary organizations other contributing countries 
include canada and australia 
the united states has either delivered or pledged more than 70 
million to the relief effort the figure for the rest of the 
international community is about 84 million according to us 
estimates 
the goal of the donor countries was to compensate for severe 
shortages expected early this year resulting from disappointing 
rainfall last summer 
but earlier this month the eritrean peoples liberation front

who was kidnapped on thursday to protest bushs visit to the the 
caribbean port city that day for an antidrug summit with three 
andean presidents

army led by former priest manuel perez claimed responsibility 
the police said speaking on condition of anonymity 
a news release from the administrative security department the 
countrys secret police said the shoulderfired missiles which 
can shoot down planes were found in a raid monday on a bogota 
drug hideout 
it said two men arrested there were suspects in the november 
slaying of tv news anchorman enrique pulido in the capital pulido 
was one of 13 news media workers killed presumably by assassins 
working for drug bosses since president virgilio barco declared

president bushs attitude toward 
organized labor appears to be a marked improvement from the reagan 
era labor leaders said but they doubt theres been a substantive 
shift in policy 
the bush administration deserves credit for its involvement in 
the pittston coal strike labor secretary elizabeth dole met with 
both sides and appointed a super mediator and for 
compromising on labors longsought hike in the minimum wage union 
leaders said 
however aflcio leaders gathered for their annual winter 
meeting also complained that bush while praising worker movements 
abroad such as solidarity in poland has demonstrated union 
busting tendencies at home by vetoing legislation to create a 
commission on the eastern airlines strike 
our president seems to be saying workers rights are fine in 
other parts of the world but not in my backyard said john 
sweeney president of the service employees international union 
the executive council of the 41 millionmember aflcio hopes to 
achieve improved relations with the bush administration as its 
33member board meets today with mrs dole 
i give bush and liz dole an aplus on pittston and a zero on 
eastern said joyce miller vice president of the amalgamated 
colthing and textile workes union 
many union officials considered ronald reagan who fired 
striking air traffic controllers in 1981 and effectively killed 
that union the worst president of the century for organized labor 
president bush and his kinder gentler nation at least talks 
about issues that affect workers like education child care and 
health care it took them long enough to come around on minimum 
wage so well see on the others sweeney said 
susan cowell vice president of the international ladies garment 
workers union said bush has been forced to improve the climate 
toward labor 
reagan created a revolution that was exposed as a fraud and 
the public tide has turned against it bush is almost forced to be 
more moderate that limits the degree to which he can hurt us 
cowell said 
bush is an odd character he doesnt embrace an ideology the 
way reagan does but its hard to see a policy difference she 
said 
last year bush agreed to address the aflcios convention in 
washington marking the first time a president had addressed the 
federation since jimmy carter did in 1979 reagan refused to speak 
in 1981 and was never invited again 
at the time aflcio president lane kirkland who a month 
earlier had called bush reagan lite said the presidents 
willingness to strike a compromise on minimum wage showed their had 
been some improvement over labors strained relationship with 
reagan 
on monday kirkland said union leaders would continue to lobby 
congress for an override of bushs veto of the eastern airlines 
legislation 
as expected the federations executive council skipped a vote 
on prochoice resolutions and instead appointed a 14member 
committee of union leaders to determine whether a stand should be 
taken 
kirkland said the panel would not be swayed much by a national 
right to life committee letterwriting campaign that urged union 
officials not to take a stand 
ive been around a while and i think i can tell grass roots 
from astroturf kirkland said insinuating the letters were not 
from rankandfile union members 
the letters warned union leaders that rankandfile members 
opposed to abortion would likely seek to have part of their union 
dues withheld if the aflcio which has sidestepped the issue for 
more than a decade adopted a prochoice position 
i do not think the committee will be moved by threats or 
suggestions of reprisals i think the committee will address the 
issues fairly and rationally and on the merits and will act 
accordingly kirkland said 
national right to life committee officials have said the aflcio 
should sit the issue out because it does not impact collective 
bargaining or workplace conditions 
prochoice union officials contend the issue impacts the 
economic wellbeing of working women they note the aflcio has 
traditionally taken a stand on a wide range of issues including 
civil rights gay rights and school busing 
i would say that the committee probably breaks down almost 
5050 said miller a prochoice member of the abortion panel 
she predicted the aflcio could adopt a prochoice position as long 
as it included language acknowledging the moral and religious views 
of some union members 
kirkland declined to identify his personal position the panels 
chairman william wynn president of the united food and commercial 
workers international union is prochoice but has said his 
personal feelings would not influence the committees decision 
kirkland did not give the panel a deadline but prochoice 
officials want a decision by the councils may meeting that would 
let labor leaders use the issue when making endorsements for the 
1990 elections

buildings in downtown tokyo swayed for more than a 
minute tuesday as a strong earthquake rocked the capital area 
there were no immediate reports of serious injuries or damage 
the earthquake struck at 353 pm and sent office workers 
leaping from their desks trains on two highspeed bullet train 
lines were briefly halted the japan broadcasting corp nhk 
reported 
the central meteorological agency said the quake measured a 
preliminary 66 on the richter scale and was centered off the izu 
peninsula southwest of tokyo an area of high seismic activity its 
epicenter was 12 miles below the ocean bed it said 
an earthquake registering 6 on the richter scale can cause 
serious damage in populated areas a quake measuring 7 is 
considered major and capable of widespread damage 
japan is hit frequently by earthquakes and many buildings in 
the tokyo area are designed to withstand strong temblors 
the earthquake registered 4 on the japanese scale of 7 in tokyo 
yokohama and tateyama west of the capital meteorological 
officials said 
a quake registering 4 on the japanese scale is strong enough to 
topple such objects as vases the japanese scale measures ground 
motion at particular locations and is not convertible to the 
richter scale which measures an earthquakes total strength 
each increase of one number in the openended richter scale 
corresponds to a tenfold increase in magnitude 
meteorological officials said there was no danger of tsunami or 
strong ocean waves caused by seismic activity

polluted snow from acid rain may be 
killing off salamanders in the colorado rockies one of a series of 
mysterious population declines among amphibians around the globe a 
researcher said 
scientists fear the decline of frog toad and salamander 
populations even in relatively pristine national parks may 
presage ecological disaster 
amphibians are tough critters said david wake director of 
the museum of vertebrate zoology at the university of california at 
berkeley they survived whatever wiped out the dinosaurs and 
they have thrived through the age of mammals if they start to 
check out now we better take it seriously 
an 8year study by john harte a professor at the university 
indicates a link between declines of hardy 6inch tiger 
salamanders in the rocky mountains and an increase in the acidity 
of ponds in which they live 
hartes study noted that snow formed from acid rain melted in 
the late spring pouring into 14 ponds he studied and raising their 
acid level 
the study found acid levels such as those created by melting 
snow severely disrupted egg growth and killed developing salamander 
embryos harte said monday 
studies in the eastern united states have shown the impact of 
acid rain on fish populations but hartes study is the first 
strong evidence that the same problem may be hitting the west the 
university said in a statement 
harte collaborated on the project with erika hoffman a 
scientist at the lawrence berkeley laboratory 
the study was presented at a special meeting called by the 
national research council at the national academy of sciences 
beckman center in irvine in southern california scientists were to 
meet through today to discuss declining amphibian populations a 
global phenomenon 
amphibians are coldblooded moistskinned creatures who spend 
part of their lives in the water and part on land declines in 
local populations on six continents were first noted in the late 
1970s 
in the past few years drastic population declines have been 
noted in such species as the golden toad in costa rican rain 
forests the yellowlegged frog in the sierra nevada and spotted 
frogs in the northwestern us which now are being considered for 
addition to the endangered species list 
suggestions about the cause of declines in specific populations 
range from acid rain and other water pollution to disease 
exploitation for food and climactic changes

stormie jones the 12yearold recipient of 
the worlds first heartliver transplant underwent a second liver 
transplant early tuesday because of damage from hepatitis 
a team of surgeons began the operation around 315 am said 
liz mcmahon a spokeswoman for childrens hospital 
the surgery was expected to last 12 to 16 hours said another 
hospital spokeswoman margy buczynski 
the doctors arent expecting many complications because she is 
in good condition ms buczynski said 
stormie and her mother lois purcell flew to pittsburgh from 
their home in white settlement texas on monday 
the surgery is necessary because stormies first donated liver 
no longer functions normally due to damage from hepatitis said liz 
mcmahon another hospital spokeswoman 
ms buczynski would not identify the donor of the new liver 
stormies heartliver transplant on feb 14 1984 was done by a 
medical team led by transplant pioneer dr thomas e starzl starzl 
will be present for part of the latest operation but dr andreas 
tzakis will lead the team ms buczynski said 
the first transplant took 16 hours the donated heart and liver 
came from a 4yearold girl who died in a new york car accident 
before the double transplant stormie had suffered two heart 
attacks and undergone two triple coronary bypass operations 
she suffered from a rare congenital disease which increased to 
10 times normal the level of cholesterol in her blood the 
imbalance was caused by a faulty liver 
stormie was leading a fairly normal life until october 1988 
when she was readmitted to childrens hospital for possible organ 
rejection she improved the next month after surgeons removed a 
bile duct obstruction but was back again in january 1989 because 
of elevated enzyme levels that interfered with her antirejection 
medication cyclosporine 
the girl started losing liver function in november and returned 
to the hospital once again starzl replaced her cyclosporine with 
an experimental japanese drug fk506 believed to be 50 to 100 
times more powerful with fewer side effects 
stormie returned to childrens hospital on jan 6 with more 
liver problems tests showed no evidence of organ rejection but 
rather a noninfectious form of hepatitis 
surgeons followed stormies 1984 operation with two more 
attempts at heartliver transplants but both patients died within 
a few days of surgery 
those were the only attempts in america at replacing the heart 
and liver in a simultaneous operation until dec 3 when pittsburgh 
surgeons performed the worlds first heartliverkidney transplant 
the patient cindy martin 26 of archbald remains in critical 
condition in the intensive care unit at presbyterianuniversity 
hospital 
ms martin also is receiving fk506 and has experienced no 
organ rejection

a nearterminally ill woman implanted with 
an artificial lung device died about 15 hours after surgery 
a team of anesthesiologists and surgeons at the penn state 
university center placed the device known as the intravascular 
oxygenator in the woman at noon sunday the university said the 
unidentified women died of pneumonia at 3 am monday 
dr michael t snider director of the study at the milton s 
hershey medical center said the device helped sustain the 
34yearold womans life during the hours it was used 
this was a woman with a nearterminal disease snider said 
unfortunately her disease was too far advanced to save her 
it was the second clinical trial of the experimental device 
melicia harvey 16 of arthur city texas died feb 7 of lung 
failure she lived 4 days on the device known as ivox which had 
functioned normally after her operation at lds hospital in salt 
lake city 
the device mimics the lungs ability to filter carbon dioxide 
out of the blood and replace it with oxygen it was designed to 
give damaged lungs time to rest and recover 
the food and drug administration has approved experimental use 
of the device for up to seven days in patients with respiratory 
problems 
before the lungassist device mechanical ventilation has been 
the only method to help patients who have trouble breathing 
the device is a 20inch bundle of hundreds of synthetic tubes 
almost as fine as human hair with walls so thin that oxygen and 
carbon dioxide can pass through 
it is inserted via the neck or groin into the inferior vena 
cava the large vein that brings blood to the heart 
two tubes the diameter of a soda straw are attached to the 
bundle of tubes and lead out of the body one delivers oxygen to 
the blood while the other removes carbon dioxide 
 
jd mortensen a thoracic surgeon and vice president for 
research at cardiopulmonics inc in salt lake city conceived the 
ivox and developed it

black members of the boston school committee 
demanded the right to veto a replacement for the citys first black 
superintendent whose ouster last week has been called racist 
during a twohour meeting with committee president daniel burke 
the four black members monday also urged that the replacement of 
laval wilson be a minority who would be selected by a panel of 
community activists parents and teachers in a nationwide search 
burke rejected the demands and said the committee would search 
for a successor to wilson 54 who was dismissed feb 13 
i am very confident that the boston school committee with the 
full input of its minority members can adequately find an interim 
and a superintendent burke said 
the black members along with committee vice president john 
grady a strong wilson supporter who is white walked out of the 
committee meeting last week shortly before the 71 vote in favor of 
ousting wilson was taken 
burke met monday with the five behind closed doors at the 
peoples baptist church in an attempt to reconcile the 13member 
panel 
minority leaders have charged the ouster was racist since the 
seven members who voted to remove wilson are white 
the group said the process deciding wilsons fate was unfair 
but did not recommend reversing the decision to buy out the 
remaining 18 months of his contract 
his reputation has been so maligned his authority so 
undermined that he believes it would not be in the best interests 
of the children to try and prolong the confusion said member 
john obryant he has asked us not to fight to keep him 
obryant asked that wilsons contract be bought out for about 
200000 burke and other committee members have said buying out 
wilsons contract would cost between 130000 and 160000 
critics of wilson said he failed to work effectively with 
parents students teachers and others to improve the citys 
schools they said little progress has been noticed in the school 
system since wilsons appointment five years ago 
blacks hispanics and asians make up about threefourths of the 
citys 56000 school population

the tokyo stock exchanges leading index fell 
sharply for the second consecutive day today amid fears of higher 
interest rates while the dollar rose slightly against the japanese 
yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average which lost 23772 points 
monday plunged an additional 32708 points or 088 percent 
closing at 3689552 
prices started lower today following mondays decline and sank 
further after the bank of japan announced a substantial increase in 
the nations money supply seen as inflationary and likely to force 
the bank to raise the official discount rate an official of nomura 
securities co said 
the supply rose by 115 percent in january from a year earlier 
it was the second straight month of doubledigit growth and the 
highest yeartoyear increase since march 1988 
chris schreiber a trader with new japan securities co said 
the growth rate was way above what people were expecting its 
definitely cause for concern its a very high level compared with 
real economic growth 
a broker speaking on condition of anonymity said the fact 
that the bank of japan did not raise the discount rate right away 
probably means that they will wait until midmarch to see what 
longterm effects the last rise has 
the discount rate the interest fee charged by the central bank 
for loans to commercial banks affects other interest rates higher 
interest rates generally discourage stock investment 
meanwhile the dollar closed at 14450 yen up 006 yen from 
mondays close of 14452 it opened at 14450 and ranged between 
14445 yen and 14465 yen 
trading totaled 5242 billion down from 7 billion on monday 
an official at the bank of tokyo said the foreign exchange 
market had expected the substiaial increase in the money supply

prime minister toshiki kaifu bolstered by what he 
called a vote of confidence in parliamentary elections today 
discussed with other governing party leaders a new lineup for the 
cabinet 
members of the conservative liberal democratic partys powerful 
executive and general councils tendered their resignations at 
meetings this morning clearing the way for kaifu and party 
powerbrokers to begin negotiations for the top cabinet and party 
posts 
party leaders also discussed strategies for battling the 
opposition over taxes and the budget when parliament convenes later 
this month 
before sundays election for the lower house of parliament 
kaifus position had appeared shaky 
he has a weak personal power base in the party and there were 
doubts about the liberal democrats chances tarnished as they were 
by an influencepeddling scandal and an unpopular sales tax 
pressed by reporters he said he would resign after just six 
months in office if the party failed to retain at least 257 of the 
512 seats in the powerful lower house 
but with 275 seats won in the election and 14 conservative 
independents likely to join them later the liberal democrats are 
not far behind the 295 seats they held in the outgoing house 
the leading opposition socialists won 136 seats up from 83 
though the combined opposition fell far short of ousting the 
liberal democrats in the lower house it holds a majority in the 
upper house which must give its assent to most bills passed by the 
more powerful chamber 
the lower house can name the prime minister pass the budget and 
approve treaties without upper house assent 
kaifu said the election result absolved the party of its 
taint of scandal and promptly declared that he would serve out his 
twoyear term as party president 
we started when the party was said to be in the greatest 
crisis since it was formed kaifu told reporters the result of 
the election is a vote of confidence of the people under the 
constitution and our government has passed it the liberal 
democrats have held power since 1955 
foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe told reporters today 
that president bush has congratulated kaifu in a letter on the 
election results 
bushs letter said he hoped both governments would continue to 
cooperate closely in promoting their partnership 
analysts say kaifus staying power will face several tough tests 
including how he deals with japans chronic trade surplus with 
the united states in the coming months and that it is possible 
he might misstep and become vulnerable again 
if he does a more powerful figure within the liberal democratic 
party former foreign minister shintaro abe is widely thought to 
be preparing to try to replace him 
kaifu 59 became prime minister in august when the liberal 
democrats were on the ropes after the resignations of two prime 
ministers amid sex and money scandals and a big loss in the july 
elections for the upper house he came from a small faction in the 
party had no personal clout and looked as if he could easily be 
the scapegoat if anything went wrong 
kaifus main opponent socialist party chairwoman takako doi 
was also strengthened after sundays polling and vowed to continue 
her struggles against the governing party 
she attributed the elections results to the liberal democrats 
backing by big business and their powerful political machines 
built up over more than three decades in power 
voters reelected major liberal democrats tainted by the scandal 
in which numerous politicians profited from cutrate stocks in a 
subsidiary of the business information firm recruit co 
they included former prime ministers yasuhiro nakasone 72 and 
noboru takeshita 65 as well as a handful of excabinet ministers 
nakasone ran as an independent

a magistrate today ruled that homicide 
was the cause of death of a sri lankan reporter for a foreign news 
agency whose body washed ashore two days after he was abducted 
richard de zoysa 33 correspondent for the romebased inter 
press service was abducted saturday from his colombo home by six 
armed men in a jeep normally used by police his mother dr 
manorami saravanamuttu told acting magistrate jinapriya peduruhewa 
de zoysa whose body washed ashore monday at moratuwa 10 miles 
south of colombo had two bullet wounds one on the neck and the 
other on his forehead said peduruhewa 
he was the first journalist working for a foreign news agency to 
be slain in sri lanka since ultranationalist sinhalese revolted 
against the sinhalesedominated government in 1987 
police said monday they suspected he was abducted by sinhalese 
militants who oppose the government for its offer of autonomy to 
minority tamils but police today said they were unable to name a 
particular group in the slaying 
de zoysa had written several articles on the sinhalese uprising 
for sri lankan newspapers 
the family had said a military official initially told them de 
zoysa had been taken for questioning by the military but later the 
family was informed de zoysa was not being held by the army 
a senior defense ministry official on monday also denied de 
zoysa was in military custody 
i do not know why my son was killed mrs saravanamuttu told 
reporters after the inquest 
i am lucky my son was well known she said i was able to 
see his body and will be able to bury him there are hundreds of 
other mothers whose sons just disappear and nothing heard after 
that 
authorities blamed sinhalese extremists from the peoples 
liberation front for the killings of three employees of the 
governmentowned television station last year 
at least 6000 people have been killed in hitandrun attacks by 
the militants and retaliation by the police and army since the 
uprising began

a sheriff who commandeered a national 
guard armory to ease overcrowding at the county jail won initial 
approval for the action from a judge 
superior court judge john f moriarty on monday issued a 
temporary restraining order prohibiting the state from evicting 
sheriff michael ashe and 15 prisoners from the armory 
moriarty also ordered armory commander col william whitman to 
give ashe keys to the buildings showers and kitchen ashes 
deputies have been transporting the prisoners to the hampden county 
jail for showers and food has been brought into the armory 
ashe also wants access to the armory telephone said his lawyer 
edward j mcdonough jr 
our feeling is that what the sheriff has done is lawful 
mcdonough said ashe took over the armory to keep the peace in 
hampden county to keep sentenced convicts off the street 
mcdonough said ashe and state officials would appear in court 
today to discuss a final solution to the conflict 
ashes move was sparked by westfield district judge philip 
contants decision to detain two hampden county deputies for five 
hours after they refused to take a prisoner to the overcrowded 
jail built to hold 279 inmates 
a federal judge ordered that no more than 500 inmates may be 
housed in the jail that cap was exceeded this week and sheriffs 
spokesman richard mccarthy said the usual remedies of early 
release late sentencing and housing prisoners elsewhere in 
massachusetts had not provided enough space 
a new prison in nearby ludlow has been approved but will take 
two to three years to build 
mccarthy blamed the jail space crisis on tougher sentencing laws 
combined with the publics reluctance to finance jails or live near 
them 
my belief is that what we have in hampden county is a real 
perfect microcosm of the whole national dilemma mccarthy said 
theres no constituency for corrections liberals find it 
distasteful and conservatives find any commitment of resources to 
be coddling

principals who broke traditions and refused 
to let bureaucracy strangle innovation were able to build better 
schools a nationwide study concluded 
those principals also helped improve teacher and student 
satisfaction according to the report released monday at the 
national association of secondary school principals annual 
convention 
good principals are like tom cruise in top gun they are on 
the edge of what can be allowed out there theyre flying their 
jets upside down said leonard pellicer a member of the 
organizations study team that conducted the research 
the study found a relationship between an individual schools 
success measured by students eagerness to learn and staff 
satisfaction and the willingness of its principals and assistant 
principals to gamble on new ideas faculty stability also was an 
important factor 
the more risks taken the better the outcomes said the 
97page report which examined the role of principals and their 
assistants at 74 schools nationwide during 1988 
risktaking behavior is probably necessary because of the 
bureaucratic nature of schools and school districts principals 
were regularly frustrated with their inability to deal with 
problems unique to the local school it said 
they were forced to go through channels the more successful 
principals often bypassed the red tape or acted pending approval 
they simply refused to let bureaucracy strangle innovation 
according to the report four factors critical to a schools 
success were the degree of autonomy given the school by its 
district amount of authority vested in the principal degree of 
community support and the competence diversity and stability of 
the school staff 
in cases where principals met resistance from a district they 
sometimes exercised creative insubordination 
its easier to ask forgiveness than it is to ask permission 
said pellicer director of the south carolina educational policy 
center and an education professor at the university of south 
carolina 
to deal with the disparate interests requires a principal who is 
more than the disciplinarian of yesteryear 
when we started out with education in america we basically 
brought kids to school and taught them reading writing and 
arithmetic now we transport them we feed them give them career 
counseling personal counseling we discipline them and develop 
them socially everything is so much more complicated and it takes 
a different kind of person to maintain a grasp of whats going 
on pellicer said 
others on the study team were james keefe the director of 
research for the reston vabased principals association edgar 
kelley a professor in the department of educational leadership at 
western michigan university and lloyd mccleary a professor in the 
department of educational administration at the university of utah

britain today pressed fellow european 
community members to drop the wealthy trading blocs ban on new 
investment in south africa hinting that it might otherwise lift 
the embargo unilaterally 
but as the meeting began in the medieval dublin castle irish 
sources suggested that as a compromise the community could send a 
factfinding team to south africa to determine whether the 
whiteled governments reform program warrants easing the embargoes 
the team would likely consist of officials from france ireland 
and italy possessors of the past present and next european 
community presidents the sources said the presidency of the 
12nation organization rotates every six months 
earlier irish officials said british foreign secretary douglas 
hurd appeared isolated in his demand for an immediate easing of 
sanctions 
the communitys commissioner for external relations frans 
andriessen added in an irish radio interview that the oneday 
meeting will not be easy but there might be much more 
understanding than people believe there to be 
the foreign ministers also were expected to focus on rapid moves 
toward german unification ireland announced last week that it 
would call a special european community summit in april because of 
the pace of developments 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain the wests most 
outspoken opponent of sanctions against south africa argues that 
the communitys relatively mild embargoes should be lifted 
gradually to reward the whiteled governments reforms 
she also says that unless south africas president fw de 
klerk can show some international response to his legalizing of 
the african national congress and release of nelson mandela this 
month he may be toppled by a white backlash 
mrs thatcher unilaterally lifted academic and cultural 
restrictions when de klerk announced his reforms this month she 
moved again saying britain would encourage such contacts when anc 
leader mandela was released feb 11 
apart from britain the community includes three of south 
africas other major trading partners west germany italy and 
france 
hurd in angry exchanges with opposition legislators in the 
british parliament last week said that if there is no agreement in 
dublin the government must reserve its right to act on its own 
if necessary 
mrs thatcher has said she will not drop unilaterally binding 
embargoes agreed on by the community in 1986 they consist mainly 
of bans on the imports of iron steel and krugerrand gold coins 
other nonbinding embargoes which mrs thatcher wants lifted 
quickly are bans on the promotion of tourism on new government 
loans to south african agencies and state funding of trade missions 
to south africa 
britain has been at the center of fierce disputes over south 
african sanctions at meetings of the commonwealth the largely 
third world association of britain and its former colonies 
the community however showed little enthusiasm for tightening 
embargoes after 1986 and its measures are far less comprehensive 
than those imposed by the united states 
in the past two years south african exports to the european 
community have more than doubled to nearly 15 billion 
international monetary fund statistics show west germany is 
south africas largest trading partner followed by japan britain 
the united states italy and france 
mandela who has called for continued embargoes until apartheid 
is dismantled said from his home in soweto monday that britains 
policy on sanctions was of primary importance 
he said he planned to telephone mrs thatcher about it after 
putting an undisclosed plan to fellow leaders of the anc

the grounding of three cargo ships 
along the stretch of coral reefs off the florida keys has led to an 
agreement by owners of 60 oil tankers to keep six miles away from 
the fragile reefs 
fifteen of the nations largest oil companies agreed monday to 
put more distance between their tankers and the 200milelong 
barrier reefs to guard against grounding and oil spills said gov 
bob martinez 
the coral reefs will be a much safer place martinez told 
reporters there were no spills from the three groundings last fall 
some 60 tankers regularly transit the straits and about 250 
other vessels occasionally passing through will stay outside the 
buffer zone some tankers carry as much as 21 million gallons of 
cargo 
the agreement which takes effect april 1 will increase the 
cost of traveling the route said amoco transport co president ed 
roland but the buffer zone will give cleanup crews considerably 
more time to contain a spill 
he could not estimate the extra costs roland who is chairman 
of the marine transportation committee of the american petroleum 
institute called the agreement a major step in further 
safeguarding the southern florida environment 
under the agreement the ships will stay 10 nautical miles or 
12 statute miles from the shoreline and five nautical miles or 
six statute miles from the edge of the shallow reefs 
ships sailing from the atlantic ocean into the gulf of mexico 
often hug the corral banks to avoid the strong fueleating 
currents of the gulf stream 
twentyfive percent of the tanker traffic will be more 
seaward than it is today martinez said

democracy battled clubwielding riot police around the legislature 
today burning police vans and smashing windows at least 80 people 
were injured authorities said 
the violence broke out after about 1000 demonstrators gathered 
outside the legislature to harass aging lawmakers of the governing 
nationalist party entering the building to elect a new speaker of 
the legislature 
the demonstrators mostly supporters of the opposition 
democratic progressive party demanded that the aging politicians 
who last faced election on the chinese mainland more than 40 years 
ago and dominate the assembly be replaced by taiwanelected 
lawmakers 
police said the clash erupted when police tried to disperse 
protesters who battered a taxi they suspected of carrying an 
elderly legislator 
police said protesters burned two police vans damaged 10 
others overturned six police cars and smashed several cars 
carrying the elderly lawmakers 
chiang kungliang a 77yearold legislator fainted in the

backed by water cannon arrived at the legislature

the demonstrators and about 30 protesters were also wounded in the 
clashes officials of the opposition party said at least five 
demonstrators were hospitalized with head injuries

nominated veteran politician liang shujung 69 to be the speaker 
in an attempt to appease old guard conservatives in the party

defense secretary dick cheney flew here today for 
talks aimed at boosting japans financial support for american 
forces stationed in japan as philippines president corazon aquino 
signaled a new willingness to discuss differences over compensation 
for us bases in her country 
the japanese are very understanding and are very willing to 
help us as much as they can said a pentagon official traveling 
with cheney speaking on condition of anonymity 
the official said that in his three days of talks cheney did 
not intend to deal in specific figures with the japanese who each 
year provide around 24 billion of the 7 billion it costs to base 
50000 us troops here 
however he said were confident they understand our 
requirements were hopeful that over the years well see a 
sizeable increase in japanese support for us forces here 
cheney on a twoweek tour that also took him to hawaii south 
korea and hong kong arrived in tokyo from clark air base in the 
philippines stopping briefly on the japanese island of okinawa to 
tour american bases 
mrs aquino had snubbed cheney during his twoday visit to the 
philippines but she sounded a more concilatory note in a statement 
issued as the defense secretary ended his visit 
i welcome the statement of support for this government and 
philippine democracy made by secretary cheney on behalf of the 
united states she said 
i also welcome his reiteration that the united states will 
make its best efforts to meet its pledge for foreign assistance 
she added referring to the 96 million shortfall in the 481 
million in aid the bush administration promised for the use of six 
military bases 
mrs aquino said the problem appears to be with the us 
congress and its funding priorities but we are as ready as the 
americans to discuss these difficulties in sincerity and good 
faith 
talks on the future of the bases whose lease expires in 
september 1991 are expected to begin in april 
columnist manuel martinez wrote in the independent newspaper the 
manila times today that americans were exploiting the philippines 
when you think of your visit here mr cheney remember you 
are coming to a country whom you massively looted and maimed and 
occupied martinez said and what do you do to the ordinary 
filipino you destabilize his democratic government you bamboozle 
his lady president you wring his neck with foreign debts 
on monday cheney met with philippine defense officials angry 
over what they believe is american failure to honor commitments 
made in 1988 to maintain the bases 
cheney told them the united states will abandon its bases in the 
philippines if it finds that keeping them is too expensive or that 
americans are unwelcome 
the united states will stay only as long as the philippine 
people wish it to stay and only if the terms negotiated are 
acceptable to both parties cheney told reporters after the 
meeting 
mrs aquino was so upset over the cut in us aid made by 
congress that she announced before cheney began his trip that she 
would not see him leaving that task to her defense minister fidel 
ramos 
security was tight during the brief visit to clark air base 
where cheney inspected us military aircraft last september 
communist rebels killed two american civilian employees of camp 
odonnell about 15 miles north of the base on the day vice 
president dan quayle arrived in manila 
on monday about 300 leftists clashed with police during a 
demonstration at the base demanding that clark and the five other 
us bases be closed police also dispersed about 200 protesters in 
front of the us embassy in manila 
we recognize there is a shortfall of 96 million over what we 
had anticipated cheney said after meeting with ramos i also 
pointed out that in east asia in this part of the world the 
united states provided a little over 600 million and about 500 
million of that comes specifically to the philippines 
an influential filipino minority is pressuring mrs aquino not 
to renew the agreement in addition leading filipino congressmen 
have urged her to postpone those discussions until this years cuts 
are restored 
there are about 18000 us military personnel in the 
philippines plus 20000 dependents 
ramos acknowledged that the bush administration needs 
congressional approval for aid commitments but said he had told 
cheney that time is of the essence in meeting current us 
obligations the secretary said ramos had been very direct and 
very forthright in presenting his governments position 
asked whether he could say that his government wanted the base 
to remain ramos declined to answer the question saying the issue 
was under discussion in the philippine congress 
us war jets from clark flew air cover for government forces 
during the coup attempt and it is widely believed the move was 
decisive in crushing the rebellion 
cheney who heads back to washington on saturday is touring the 
asian nations with us bases in preparation for an april 1 
assessment he is to give congress on the nations military posture 
in the pacific 
he has been telling officials in each nation that there is a 
limit to the pentagon pocketbook and that budget pressures may 
force 10 percent to 12 percent cutbacks in us military forces 
based in japan south korea and the philippines

africa must face the future 
expecting less economic aid as the west turns its attention toward 
eastern europe africas foreign ministers were told today 
the rapid changes in eastern europe have drastically altered 
the political thinking and strategic considerations of the west 
said salim ahmed salim secretary general of the organization of 
african unity 
the need for our economic unity is made all the more urgent in 
the face of the shift of priority by the west to eastern europe 
he told the ministers who met on the second day of their annual 
fiveday conference 
abebayo adedeji executive secretary of the un economic 
commission for africa also urged the foreign ministers to prepare 
for the future 
we should be ready for a new political world map and we should 
be prepared to fit into that new map not as a residual component 
but as a full and essential part of it he said 
some african leaders have expressed concern that western nations 
would abandon the continent and divert aid they previously gave 
africans to eastern europe where communist hardliners have been 
replaced by reformist leaders 
another item on the agenda is political changes in south africa 
where president fw de klerk recently legalized the african 
national congress and freed prison nelson mandela the best known

about 1000 students marched in the 
streets of the capital today and hijacked two buses to demand an 
impartial investigation into the slaying of kenyas foreign 
minister police said 
the demonstration came a day after the government issued its 
first detailed report on the death of the minister robert ouko 
and announced two british detectives and a pathologist were joining 
the investigation 
the students from the university of nairobi and kenyatta 
university were demonstrating for a fourth day 
the protesters carried green branches and chanted who killed 
bob no coverup and we want justice they taunted 
police with shouts of where were you 
police on friday discovered oukos partially burned body in the 
brush about four miles from his family farm in koru near lake 
victoria in western kenya he had been missing for four days 
the students estimated by one police officer to number 1000 
gathered today around the statue of kenyas first president after 
independence jomo kenyatta in the heart of the capital 
they then marched past government offices and demanded that 
hezekiah oyugi the permanent secretary in the office of the 
president resign oyugi is in charge of internal security 
the students commandeered two buses which were driven to oukos 
suburban nairobi residence 
the british investigation team comprises superintendent john 
troon and inspector graham dennis of scotland yard and dr ian 
west the government said late monday 
the move was seen in part as a government attempt to allay fears 
of a coverup since kenya gained independence the murders of 
three prominent politicians have gone unsolved and the former 
kenyatta government was accused of covering them up 
scotland yard is the commonly used name for the london police 
kenya is a former british colony and its security personnel 
continue to receive training from britons 
ouko disappeared one week ago apparently without telling 
colleagues or family members his disappearance was reported two 
days later 
the government on monday said pathologists found a bullet hole 
in the 58yearold ministers head 
in a statement it said police also found a 38caliber revolver 
near oukos right hand and the central firearms bureau which 
licenses guns identified the weapon as belonging to the minister 
near his body police also found a gas can and a plastic bag 
containing a pair of jeans a shirt and a leather jacket the 
jacket pockets contained four bullets and kenyan currency 
equivalent to 18 
the clothes were identified as belonging to ouko and a storeman 
said the gas can resembled one previously stored at the ministers 
home the statement said 
ouko was considered one of the most articulate and able members 
of president daniel arap mois cabinet he first served as 
permanent secretary in the foreign ministry in 1963 when kenya 
gained independence from britain 
ouko later held other highranking government jobs before being 
tapped by moi to head the foreign ministry in 1979

west germanys us ambassador 
acknowledging jewish concerns about german reunification told 
american jewish leaders that germans would stand up against any 
violations of human rights 
but mondays speech by ambassador jurgen ruhfus met a skeptical 
response and repeated questions about what a new german state would 
do to ensure that centuriesold conflicts among christians jews 
and moslems would not explode 
there is no guarantee ruhfus told about 500 delegates 
monday at the national convention of the american jewish congress 
but i can from my deepest convictions say that you can trust 
us he said prompting groans from the crowd in a hotel meeting 
room you can count on germans to stand up against any 
infringement of human rights 
it was ruhfus first public address to a jewish audience since 
serious discussions began of a union of east and west germany the 
ambassador said germans have worked for four decades to ensure nazi 
atrocities wont be repeated 
the german state he added would be accountable not to 
nationalism but to a new european federation based on individual 
freedoms and human rights 
we germans are aware that a germany growing together will be 
viewed in part with concern with considerable concern he said 
we are convinced that this fear is unjustified 
henry siegman executive director of the american jewish 
congress said afterward that jewish concerns in the aftermath of 
the holocaust are not easily susceptible to dissipation by some 
simple even rational political formula 
however he added to the extent that a jewish audience can be 
reassured that the german political leaders understand their 
concerns the ambassadors presentation was extremely 
wellreceived and considered reassuring 
ruhfus said west germany has accepted responsibility for the 
hitler era deaths of some 12 million people including 6 million 
jewish victims of the holocaust 
i understand the feelings of those who have suffered ruhfus 
said if we want to shape the future we must be aware of the 
past

the supreme court today allowed the federal 
government to withhold highway funds from states that do not comply 
with a national speed limit 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by nevada 
officials who want to set the speed limit at 70 mph on some state 
highways 
congress established a 55 mph national speed limit in 1973 in 
response to the arab oil embargo the law was aimed at conserving 
oil although it also was endorsed as a safety measure 
the limit was raised to 65 mph in 1987 for rural highways that 
move blunted most protests primarily from western states over the 
55 mph limit 
the 1987 law affects about threefourths of the 43000mile 
interstate system and makes another 7000 miles of federal state 
and local highways eligible for the 65 mph limit 
most states raised the speed limit to 65 mph on affected rural 
roads after congress allowed it 
the nevada legislature in 1985 increased the states limit to 70 
mph and in 1986 that limit was posted on a 33mile stretch of 
interstate 80 but the higher speed limit was withdrawn when 
federal officials threatened to cut off highway aid to the state 
nevada officials then sued in federal court saying the state 
had no real choice but to comply with the national speed limit 
because otherwise it would lose about 95 percent of its highway 
funds 
the state officials said the national limit violates the 
constitution by coercing compliance by the states 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals last august rejected the 
states arguments 
the impropriety of making judicial judgments regarding a 
states financial capabilities renders the coercion theory highly 
suspect the appeals court said 
it noted that nevada one of several states with no income tax 
could increase its tax revenue to make up for a cutoff in federal 
funds 
moreover the appeals court said congress could order states to 
adhere to a national speed limit not merely cut off funds for 
noncompliance 
the appeals court relied in part on a 1987 supreme court ruling 
that upheld a federal law threatening to reduce highway aid to 
states that refused to adopt a minimum drinking age of 21 
the case is nevada vs skinner 89686

colorado lost a highstakes fight today with 
the federal government over money and other property seized from 
drug traffickers as the supreme court refused to hear the states 
appeal 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that the 
proceeds of drug transactions automatically are forfeited to the 
federal government in the case that had been appealed the 
government later transferred nearly all the money to local police 
departments 
the case involved 15 million in cash and gold bars colorado 
attorney general duane woodward had contended that a states claim 
on such money and property to satisfy owed taxes sometimes should 
take precedence 
police in lakewood colo seized the cash and 12 gold bars from 
the home of albert and victoria levy during a nov 21 1982 search 
the money and gold were the proceeds of a cocaine deal 
the next month state tax authorities assessed taxes totaling 
194000 against albert levy based on alleged narcotics sales of 
almost 3 million in 1982 
a state judge ruling on a tax lien imposed said the money 
could come from the seized proceeds 
federal authorities meanwhile went into a federal court in 
denver seeking forfeiture of the seized loot they said a 1978 law 
gave the federal government a superior claim to the proceeds 
because forfeiture dates back to the commission of the crime 
us district judge john kane jr ruled that part of the states 
tax lien should be paid from the cocaine deal proceeds but justice 
department lawyers appealed his ruling 
the 10th us circuit court of appeals last april 21 reversed 
judge kanes ruling and ordered that all the proceeds be forfeited 
to the federal government 
the appeals court ruled that the 1978 law permits a federal 
claim to seized drugtrafficking proceeds at the time a crime was 
committed which always will come before a states attempt to 
attach a tax lien 
in the states appeal woodward said the appeals court ruling 
unduly interferes with state taxing powers the appeal also argued 
that the federal forfeiture law was permissive not mandatory 
bush administration lawyers urged the court to reject the 
states appeal noting that congress in 1984 amended the law to say 
explicitly that the interest of the united states vests at the 
time of the act giving rise to the forfeiture 
they argued also that the forfeiture law is mandatory 
last october judge kane ordered the cash and gold bars released 
to the federal government last dec 7 us attorney general dick 
thornburgh authorized transfer of about 90 percent of the forfeited 
propertys value to five police and sheriffs departments in 
colorado 
the lakewood police department received the bulk 63 percent of 
the revenuesharing transfer 
the case is colorado v us 89699

the owners and managers of an apartment 
complex have agreed to pay a record 450000 to settle a lawsuit 
accusing them of discriminating against blacks attorneys said 
the outofcourt agreement made friday but announced monday 
followed an undercover investigation by a housing rights group and 
is one of the largest ever in a housing discrimination case 
racial discrimination is still a very entrenched problem in 
this country said patrick o patterson an attorney for the 
plaintiffs if you looked at the evidence in this case attitudes 
that many people hoped would have been gone years ago are very much 
present 
until a 1988 amendment to the federal fair housing act punitive 
damages in such cases were limited to 1000 
the largest previous settlement in a housing discrimination case 
was 375000 in a new york case which was appealed after a jury 
awarded 500000 to the plaintiffs according to the naacp legal 
defense and education fund 
in addition to the money the defendants agreed to open the 
apartment complex to black residents and the percentage of black 
renters has increased from 2 percent to 17 percent patterson said 
the dispute began in october 1987 when allan lopez 29 who is 
black was refused permission to share the apartment of robert 
patrick o beaumont 31 who is white 
managers at the belford park apartments had lopez fill out a 
rental application then rejected him on grounds of his credit 
history patterson said 
many of the white tenants either had significantly worse credit 
histories than lopez or were not required to fill out rental 
applications the attorney said 
the nonprofit westside fair housing council sent three 
undercover investigators to the apartment complex to pose as 
prospective tenants 
a black investigator was told there were no vacancies while the 
two white investigators were told units were available patterson 
said 
lawsuits were filed in federal and state court against los 
angelesbased westchester investment co which owned the complex 
gutweilerwoolley properties which managed it at the time and a 
couple who were the onsite managers 
the owners and mangers were not available for comment phone 
messages left with westchester investments answering service were 
not returned and there was no listing for gutweilerwoolley the 
couple who managed the complex have moved out of state

the supreme court today refused to hear an 
appeal by a man convicted in the socalled pizza connection case in 
which prosecutors said tons of imported heroin and cocaine were 
distributed through a network of pizza parlors 
the court without comment let stand the conviction and 30year 
prison sentence of filippo casamento who said he was only a 
peripheral figure in the drug ring 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals last october upheld the 
convictions of casamento and 14 other men convicted in 1987 in new 
york city after a 17month trial one of the longest and costliest 
in history 
federal prosecutors said the drug ring brought narcotics valued 
at 16 billion into the country from turkey sicily and brazil 
all told there were 21 defendants and numerous charges of 
conspiracy racketeering money laundering and other offenses on 
three continents dating back to the 1970s not all those convicted 
appealed to the 2nd circuit court 
in the appeal acted on today casamentos lawyers described him 
as a small fish caught up in a flood of evidence concerning mafia 
wrongdoing and international narcotics dealings 
they said his rights were violated because he was not tried 
separately 
the 2nd circuit court said that while it had misgivings about 
the length and complexity of the trial and the number of 
defendants the rights of the accused were not violated 
the appeals court also suggested some new guidelines including 
possibly limiting the number of defendants if a joint trial is 
expected to last more than four months 
as for casamento the appeals court said there was sufficient 
evidence for the jury to conclude he engaged in illegal drug deals 
the leading defendants in the case were gaetano badalamenti 
reputed former head of the mafia in sicily and salvatore catalano 
the rings reputed new york boss both were sentenced to 45 years 
in prison 
the case is casamento vs us 891178

the supreme court today let stand a ruling 
that shields government social workers from being sued for placing 
children in foster homes where they are sexually abused 
the justices without comment refused to review a federal 
appeals court ruling that the social workers enjoy absolute 
immunity if their childplacement decisions were approved by a 
court 
in a decision that set a legal precedent for nine western 
states the 9th us circuit court of appeals said social workers 
in such cases share the absolute immunity that shields judges 
prosecutors and others in judicial proceedings 
the scope of such judicial immunity was the sole issue before 
the high court in a case from washington state 
the justices last october let stand a different federal appeals 
courts ruling in a maryland case that children who are abused by 
foster parents may not sue the government social workers who placed 
them in those homes 
in that case the appeals court did not rely on immunity 
instead it ruled that child abuse by foster parents is private 
not governmental violence 
the supreme court last year ruled that public officials may not 
be sued in federal court when their alleged gross negligence 
permits a child to be abused by a parent what the court called 
private violence 
that decision said a state has no constitutional duty to protect 
people including abused children who are not in the states 
custody but it left undecided whether a constitutional duty exists 
to protect children from foster parents chosen by government 
officials 
in the case acted on today two caseworkers with the washington 
department of social and health services were sued by three sisters 
who said they were repeatedly raped sodomized and sexually 
assaulted by their foster father over an 18month period in 198283 
the girls were ages six eight and 12 when the attacks allegedly 
began 
the foster father lee michael subsequently was convicted of 
statutory rape and indecent liberties he is serving a 55year 
prison sentence 
michael was the girls uncle the girls mother who committed 
suicide in 1978 was a sister to michaels wife 
the girls civil rights lawsuit named social workers wanda tyler 
and mark bronson as defendants the suit alleged that the social 
workers had violated the girls interest in being free from harm 
while in state custody 
ms tyler in the spring of 1982 placed one of the girls all of 
whom were then residing with their fathers parents in richland 
wash with michael bronson who took over the case from ms 
tyler placed the two other girls with michael shortly thereafter 
a federal trial judge refused to dismiss the suit but the 9th 
circuit court reversed that ruling last sept 6 
finding the social workers role to be an integral one in the 
judicial process the appeals court said they are entitled to 
absolute immunity 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for the girls noted that 
most foster care placements are courtapproved and involve periodic 
court reviews federal law bars states from obtaining federal 
reimbursement for foster care if the placements are not 
courtapproved 
the appeals court ruling is binding law in washington arizona 
alaska california hawaii idaho montana nevada and oregon

the supreme court today left intact a ruling 
that drastically limits the right of authors to quote unpublished 
material such as diaries and letters 
the court without comment refused to hear an appeal by a 
company that published a biography attacking the late l ron 
hubbard founder of the church of scientology 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals in a ruling last april 
that was denounced by scholars publishers and freespeech 
advocates imposed strict limits on the use of quotations from 
unpublished material 
the appeals court said federal copyright law generally bars use 
of such material without permission the appeals court rejected 
arguments that the ban violates constitutionally protected free 
expression 
the april ruling relied in part on an earlier 2nd circuit 
court decision barring random house from publishing a biography of 
author jd salinger unless quotations from and paraphrases of 
salingers letters were deleted 
because of a technicality the appeals court refused to block 
further publication of the hubbard biography entitled barefaced 
messiah the appeals court said the copyright owners who are 
affiliated with the scientologists waited too long to seek a court 
order blocking publication 
ironically that made henry holt and co publisher of the 
biography the technical winner before the appeals court 
the company nonetheless filed the appeal acted on today the 
appeal argued that holt suffered damages because us publication 
of barefaced messiah was blocked for nearly a year before the 
appeals court ruled 
moreover the company said the principle is of overriding 
importance it called the april ruling a grave threat to the 
publishing industry because the 2nd circuit court is based in new 
york city home to most of the nations major book publishers 
lawyers for holt said the ruling means the copyright law that 
was intended to promote the progress of the useful arts is now 
repeatedly being used to muzzle responsible biographers and 
historians 
the publisher also said the hubbard estate and the 
scientologists were largely successful in using their copyright 
monopoly to manipulate the public perception of mr hubbard and to 
prevent disclosure of the uncomfortable truth about a man who held 
himself out as a prophet 
numerous groups such as the american historical association and 
the authors guild supported the holt appeal 
barefaced messiah written by russell miller accuses 
hubbard of fakery and deception holt said quoting from hubbards 
unpublished letters and diaries was intended to expose the church 
founders lies 
new era publications a danish corporation is the church 
affiliate that holds the copyright on hubbards unpublished 
material 
the case is holt vs new era publications 89869

parents suspected of child abuse may be jailed 
indefinitely for refusing to disclose the whereabouts of their 
children the supreme court ruled today 
the court said societys need to protect children from harm 
generally outweighs a parents constitutional right against 
selfincrimination 
by a 72 vote the court upheld the indefinite jailing of a 
maryland woman until she tells authorities where her young son can 
be found the boy is feared dead 
justice sandra day oconnor writing for the court said forcing 
parents in such cases to reveal the whereabouts of children is 
aimed at protecting the children and not gathering incriminating 
evidence 
even when criminal conduct may exist a court may properly 
request production and return of the child for reasons related 
entirely to the childs wellbeing and through measures unrelated 
to criminal law enforcement or investigation oconnor said 
justices william j brennan and thurgood marshall dissented 
the court ruled against jacqueline bouknight who has been in a 
baltimore jail since april 1988 for refusing to disclose the 
whereabouts of her son maurice 
the boy has been missing since september 1987 when he was 11 
months old 
maurice was admitted to a baltimore hospital on jan 23 1987 
when he was 3 months old for treatment of a broken leg and other 
injuries for a while he was held in protective care after his 
emotionally troubled mother was observed throwing maurice into his 
crib during the infants hospitalization 
maurice was returned to his mothers custody on july 17 1987 
after she agreed not to punish him physically and to undergo 
training in parenting skills 
nine months later social workers said bouknight no longer was 
cooperating with them also they said maurices father recently 
had been shot to death in a drugrelated killing and bouknight was 
using drugs 
the mother was held in contempt of court by a judge on april 28 
1988 after she refused to disclose maurices whereabouts 
but the maryland court of appeals the states highest court 
ruled in december that jailing her for refusing to disclose the 
information violates her constitutional protection against 
selfincrimination 
she has remained in jail under an order by chief jusice william 
h rehnquist that suspended the effect of the state court ruling 
some compared the bouknight case to that of dr elizabeth morgan 
of washington dc released from prison on sept 25 after more 
than two years behind bars for refusing to let her daughter visit 
the girls father morgans former husband 
morgan went to jail rather than produce the girl for 
courtordered visits with the father morgan accused her former 
husband of sexually abusing the child charges he repeatedly has 
denied 
in the bouknight case oconnor said the mother as custodian 
of a child officials have determined has been abused has an 
obligation to produce her son for authorities 
these orders to produce children cannot be characterized as 
efforts to gain some testimonial component of the act of 
production oconnor said concern for the childs safety 
underlay the efforts to gain access to and then compel production 
of maurice 
she hinted that prosecutors may be barred from using any 
testimony bouknight gives in producing the child 
but marshall in his dissenting opinion said that is little 
comfort now for the mother 
i am not content to deny bouknight the constitutional 
protection required now in the hope that she will not be 
convicted later on the basis of her own testimony he said in an 
opinion joined by brennan 
the case is baltimore department of social services vs 
bouknight 881182

the supreme soviet legislature today urged a 
crackdown on illegal demonstrations planned for sunday and said 
authorities should exercise tight control over permitted rallies 
the official tass news agency reported 
the legislators said they feared extremists and criminals will 
exploit the demonstrations to destabilize the soviet unions 
political situation 
the rallies are being organized by political groups in moscow 
leningrad and other major cities to express their attitude to 
changes taking place in the country tass said 
the resolution introduced by deputy nikolai pivovarov urged 
authorities to curb unsanctioned rallies and force legal 
demonstrations to be held in specifically assigned places 
on monday lithuanias communist party urged the kremlin to 
begin talks on granting independence to the republic tass reported 
the committee adopted a statement saying it views as its chief 
objective the restoration of an independent lithuanian state and 
the ensuring of its international recognition the official news 
agency said 
the lithuanian communist party declared itself independent from 
the soviet party on dec 20 creating the first major crack in the 
monolithic party that has ruled the soviet union since the 1917 
bolshevik revolution 
the lithuanian statement said restoration of a lithuanian state 
must be achieved through parliamentary constitutional means 
tass said 
official negotiations between the soviet union and lithuania 
should begin soon with the aim of establishing stable international 
relations and economic cooperation between the ussr and 
lithuania the news agency quoted the statement as saying 
lithuania a baltic republic with a population of 34 million 
was forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 1940 along with the 
other baltic republics of latvia and estonia 
president mikhail s gorbachev who helped set in motion 
nationalist movements by encouraging democratic reform went on a 
personal mission to the lithuanian capital of vilnius to try to 
dissuade the republics people from leaving the soviet fold 
but the lithuanians showed themselves resolved to establish an 
independent state 
last week in an acknowledgment of slipping central authority 
the soviet communist partys central committee voted to end the 
partys constitutionally guaranteed monopoly on power and compete 
for the right to govern 
on monday the supreme soviet legislature devoted a closeddoor 
session to ethnic and nationalist unrest and sources said debate 
focused on the restive southern caucasus 
gorbachev chaired the session and supported a proposal for 
armenian and azerbaijani delegates to begin negotiations on their 
dispute the sources said it urges neighboring republics to draft 
a treaty on their territorial dispute over nagornokarabakh a 
mainly armenian enclave in azerbaijan but the azerbaijanis 
rejected the proposal and walked out of the session said arkady n 
murachev a moscow delegate 
although reporters were barred from the sevenhour meeting two 
participants murashev and vitautas a statulyavicus of lithuania 
gave details in telephone interviews 
deputies agreed in a few days to vote on a resolution on the 
dispute the source of bloody feuding between the ethnic groups for 
two years but previous supreme soviet action has failed to calm 
tempers in the caucasus 
on jan 20 soviet troops stormed into the azerbaijani capital 
of baku to put down a nationalist revolt and end attacks on members 
of the ethnic armenian minority official reports say 139 people 
were killed including 106 civilians 28 troops and five policemen 
azerbaijani delegates blamed the army for the civilian deaths 
but defense minister dmitri t yazov contended azerbaijani 
extremists were to blame

the supreme court today made it easier for 
disabled children to win some federal welfare benefits 
by a 72 vote the justices struck down a government regulation 
that gave children seeking the benefits less protection than adults 
the bush administration said the decision could force officials 
to reevaluate benefits for more than 250000 children 
the court ruled in favor of disabled children seeking what is 
called supplemental security income from the department of health 
and human services 
the benefits are provided to the disabled of all ages an adult 
is considered disabled if he or she is unable to engage in any 
substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically 
determinable physical or mental impairment lasting at least a 
year 
children under 18 are considered disabled if they suffer from 
any medically determinable physical or mental impairment of 
comparable severity 
the definitions were interpreted by hhs officials in a way that 
made it more difficult for children to qualify 
if an adults mental condition does not meet one of those listed 
in hhs regulations he or she is entitled to an individual 
assessment to determine the extent of the functional impairment 
but the hhs rule struck down today did not permit such 
individual determinations for children 
the bush administration said treating adults differently makes 
sense because they are evaulated with regard to their ability to 
work 
but justice harry a blackmun writing for the supreme court 
said a similar analysis can be used with regard to children 
an inquiry into the impact of an impairment on the normal 
daily activities of a childis no more amorphous or unmanageable 
than an inquiry into the impact of an adults impairment on his 
ability to performgainful work blackmun said 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justice byron r white 
dissented 
the case stemmed from an appeal by brian zebley of pennsylvania 
who suffers from congenital brain damage that has caused 
retardation and other problems the government cut off the 
supplemental benefits when the boy turned 4 in 1982 
justice department officials said a victory for the zebley boy 
could force hhs to reevaluate more than 250000 cases in which 
children have been denied benefits between 1983 and 1988 hhs 
estimated the cost of the reevaluations alone would be more than 
41 million 
the case is sullivan vs zebley 881377

a centuryold tradition of maleonly 
membership at two princeton university eating clubs could end 
within a year 
tiger inn one of the last two allmale eating clubs voted 
monday to end its policy of excluding women from membership 
the vote came less than a week after ivy club the only other 
allmale institution on the central new jersey campus voted in 
favor of admitting women 
under club rules a final policy change at each club requires a 
second confirming vote in one year which must then be approved by 
each clubs graduate board made up of alumni 
the ivy club and the tiger inn are the last two of the schools 
13 private eating establishments that do not admit women most 
juniors and seniors take their meals at the clubs which are housed 
in private homes near the campus 
despite pressure from opponents of the allmale policy many 
undergraduate women have attended the clubs which allow women to 
visit and use their facilities but not to join 
i think women go there to allmale clubs because of their 
laidback attitude sophomore julie slattery said we always 
have fun at their parties 
tiger inn president mike salerno said the decision to admit 
women would enhance the club some here decided this day and this 
year that it will be a positive change he said 
news of the vote pleased opponents of the maleonly policies 
im really happy and surprised said jen weiner a junior 
who directs the coalition for coeducated eating clubs i was 
concerned that there would be some backlash because of ivys 
decision in that the members might want tiger to remain the last 
bastion of allmaleness 
the two clubs have maintained their maleonly positions for 11 
years in the face of a sex discrimination lawsuit filed by sally 
frank a princeton graduate 
ms frank filed a lawsuit against three eating clubs that 
continued to deny membership to women after the university began 
admitting female students in 1969 the other 10 voluntarily opened 
their doors to women after the school went coed 
cottage club the third eating club originally sued by ms 
frank voted to end its discriminatory practices in 1986 and 
settled with ms frank for 20000 
the university was originally named in the suit but also settled 
in 1986 paying ms frank 27500 in legal fees and pledging to 
disassociate itself from sexually segregated clubs 
in may 1987 the new jersey division on civil rights ruled in 
ms franks favor and ordered tiger inn and ivy club to admit 
women however the superior court of new jersey appellate division 
reversed that decision in october 1988 due to procedural errors 
following the clubs appeal the case is pending in the new jersey 
state supreme court

the government is looking into whether to 
enlist swarms of caterpillars in the war against cocaine in peru 
and bolivia by setting them loose to eat coca plant leaves 
officials said today 
but a spokesman for national drug policy director william 
bennett emphasized that the program is in the experimental stage 
and that any unleashing of the caterpillars would have to be 
approved by the peruvian and bolivian governments 
the updated national drug control strategy released jan 25 
seeks 65 million for agriculture department research in fiscal 
year 1991 starting oct 1 a 5 million increase over the 15 
million to be spent this year 
the washington post which first reported on the plan in todays 
editions described the program to develop chemical and biological 
agents to destroy drug crops as secretive 
however bennetts spokesman don hamilton said its out 
there in the strategy its in the budget documents if we didnt 
look into this stuff i think wed be irresponsible 
hamilton stressed that the united states is not considering 
biological warfare against anyone or anything 
these are experimental programs looking at all drug plants to 
try and learn as much as we can about them including herbicides 
and natural enemies of the plants he said this isnt 
something that is an option yet its a prospect of an option 
the proposed experiments he said would have to show that one 
of these things was safe and effective and then you would have 
to talk to the governments involved and see if theyre interested 
until you do that you dont have anything the spokesman said 
the post said the principal focus of the effort is the malumbia 
a white moth that in its caterpillar stages eats the leaves of the 
coca plant 
growers in perus upper huallaga valley where more than half 
the worlds cocaine originates douse their crops with insecticide 
to kill the native malumbia caterpillars 
the newspaper said researchers believe that if they could breed 
the insect in mass quantities hundreds of millions of malumbia 
eggs or caterpillars could be airdropped over the cocagrowing 
regions thwarting the growers efforts at crop protection 
waldemar klassen associate deputy administrator for the 
agricultural research service told the post this is quite a 
voracious caterpillar if we could put them down there in 
sufficient number we could then defoliate the plants 
klassen was not immediately available to discuss the report 
both klassen and program leader larry christy were in meetings this 
morning according to aides 
the post reported that there has been no public disclosure of 
the project and one official told the newspaper he was reluctant 
to discuss it for fear of upsetting latin american leaders 
hamilton denied that the research was secret adding that 
general outlines were included in the strategy update and 
accompanying budget document 
the strategy does not specifically mention the caterpillar 
experiments or provide details of research plans but it notes 
great advances have been made in agriculture through the 
development of biological agents to enhance or reduce the 
productivity of various crops such endeavors may also have 
applicability to various aspects of the drug war 
the strategy says this is the reason for the 5 million increase 
in the agricultural research service drug budget request and says 
the research findings would be shared with and be made available 
to foreign governments 
the drug strategy budget summary document says the 5 million 
would be used in part to support increased research and 
development on nonherbicidal methods of control 
president nixon encouraged work on a biologically engineered 
worm during the height of the heroin epidemic in the 1970s more 
recently scientists have been working on an herbicide to kill 
drugproducing crops both efforts were not been carried forward 
because of political resistance by latin american governments 
were not looking for some magic bullet here hamilton said 
even if the caterpillar successfully wiped out coca crops he said 
youve still got other drugs this doesnt end everyones 
problems by any stretch of the imagination

communist premier hans modrow today urged 
east german and west german experts to start immediate talks on 
reunification under a formula negotiated with the world war ii 
allies last week 
meanwhile a joint commission led by cabinet ministers of the 
two germanys met today for the first time for talks on monetary and 
economic union between the two states a major step on the road to 
unification 
modrow addressing the east german parliament said experts from 
the two german states should begin preparing the 2plus4 
conference as soon as possible 
at a meeting in ottawa canada the victorious world war ii 
allies the united states the soviet union britain and france 
agreed with the two german states on a twostage plan to achieve 
german unification 
in the first stage experts from the two germanys would discuss 
political economic and legal steps to achieve unity in the second 
stage the two states would be joined by the four allies to discuss 
the international implications of unification the formula became 
known as 2plus4 
parallel to these talks preparations should be made for the 
35nation conference on security and cooperation in europe modrow 
said 
modrow also said the german states should issue a joint 
statement guaranteeing polands western borders 
he again ruled out membership in nato for a united germany the 
soviet union wants a united germany to become neutral while west 
germany and its western allies insist it should remain in the 
alliance 
earlier in his address to parliament modrow appealed to east 
germans not to hoard food following announcement that subsidies 
would be removed soon he said he had heard of runs on grocery 
stores to stock up while prices remain low 
i ask every citizen to show restraint and not to buy beyond 
normal needs he said 
on monday representatives of 16 organizations including the 
communistled government the prodemocracy parties and labor 
unions agreed to abolish state food subsidies before the march 18 
free elections 
the subsidies are being lifted in part to stop a run by west 
germans on cheaper food across the border and to put prices in 
line with the cost of production 
modrow did not specify which areas of east germany were 
suffering from panic foodbuying and no unusual crowding was 
noticed at east berlin stores 
modrow also urged east germans to keep their money in the banks 
east germans worried about their savings becoming worthless under 
a monetary union with west germany have been withdrawing their 
funds from banks 
he repeated his rejection of a monetary union before the 
election and again urged the west german government to approve 
massive immediate aid for the struggling east german economy 
in bonn west german chancellor helmut kohl met with industrial 
leaders to discuss german economic cooperation he said there would 
be no bailout unless east germany adopts wide reforms to encourage 
private investment including accepting the west german mark as the 
official currency 
leaders in both states hope a monetary union would stem the 
daily exodus of 2000 east germans to their rich neighbor 
walter romberg the minister without portfolio heading east 
germanys side in the talks said the panel would attempt to define 
exactly what a monetary and economic union is and what is needed to 
achieve it 
romberg said east germany will demand safeguards to protect his 
countrys pensioners unemployed and the savings of its citizens 
against losses in the event of monetary union 
horst koehler the state secretary in the bonn finance ministry 
leading the west german delegation said no target date for 
concluding the negotiations had been set 
east german economics minister christa luft said monday she 
believed a monetary union was possible before the end of the year 
kohl earlier this month offered a quick monetary union 
believing it would give east germans confidence in their future 
but east germans fear unemplyoment as inefficient factories are 
forced to close under a more competitive capitalist system 
while talks on reunification opened another piece of the cold 
war headed into oblivion as east german border guards started 
dismantling the berlin wall between the reichstag building and the 
checkpoint charlie border crossie next month the wall will be removed 
until the entire 
12mile stretch between the parliament building or reichstag and 
checkpoint charlie is gone 
since east germany opened its borders on nov 9 numerous 
crossings have been opened in the wallng 
over th thousands of souvenir 
hunters have chiseled away huge chunks of the concrete leaving 
gaping holes 
despite euphoria over removal of the hated wall the two 
countries moves toward unification is provoking unease according 
to a survey commissioned by west germanys zdf television network 
twothirds of west germans think the process is unfolding too fast 
the survey also revealed 71 percent of west germans want berlin 
to become the capital of reunited germanslug pmdrought payments sent

new yorks highest court today upheld child 
pornography charges against an albany man in a case involving only 
the purchase of pornography not its distribution or production 
but the court disappointed prosecutors by stopping short of a 
precedentsetting decision that could have outlawed the possession 
of child pornography throughout the state 
the court of appeals decided 70 that albany county prosecutors 
had properly secured a fivecount indictment against william keyes 
for promoting a sexual performance by a child 
a lawyer for keyes 41 contended that although keyes bought the 
magazines and videotapes with titles including wonderboy and 
lolita colour special 7 from undercover police officers he had 
not procured the magazines and videotapes under the meaning of 
the state antipornography statute 
to fall under the law albany lawyer terence kindlon argued 
keyes would have had to arrange for underage models to appear in a 
pornographic performance or he would have had to sell the items 
himself to other people 
the court rejected those arguments 
in a decision by judge fritz alexander iii the court concluded 
that the state legislature clearly meant for the purchase of child 
pornography to fall under the acts covered by the word procure 
when creating the statute a decade ago 
alexander said the statute is directed at the consumers of 
child pornography as well as at its manufacturers and 
distributors 
however the court did not make the kind of blanket antichild 
pornography pronouncement that prosecutor george barber had hoped 
it would make 
alexander did call child pornography a social evil but 
because keyes was charged with promoting the items rather than 
possessing them alexander said it was not necessary for the court 
to address the question of whether possession of child pornography 
is constitutionally protected 
thirteen states have explicitly outlawed possession of child 
pornography and barber said he had hoped the court today would 
remind new yorks legislature that it could follow suit 
keyes an auto body worker and partially disabled vietnam war 
veteran faces a maximum of 3 to 7 years in prison on each of the 
five counts he had been on 5 years probation for a conviction for 
promoting a sexual performance by a child at the time of his arrest

a quadriplegic who received court 
permission to turn off the machine that keeps him alive plans to 
ask the georgia senate on wednesday to take steps to help people in 
his situation 
larry mcafee 34 who since has abandoned plans to take his own 
life has said he plans to ask the lawmakers to review their 
policies of keeping people like myself cooped away in nursing 
homes 
he said he also will talk about his general dislike of nursing 
homes which he said cause patients to lose control of decisions 
about their everyday lives 
mcafee a georgia resident was sent to briarcliff nursing home 
at alabaster in august because it is one of the few residences with 
special units for patients dependent on ventilators to help them 
breathe last fall he got permission from the georgia supreme 
court to turn off his ventilator 
mcafee a mechanical engineer and sportsman before a 1985 
motorcycle accident left him paralyzed below the chin changed his 
mind about the ventilator after he was befriended by several people 
who work at the nursing home 
mcafee will speak to the lawmakers at the request of state sen 
hildred shumake an aide vinyl baker said shumake plans to work 
to change the system that forces mcafee and other disabled people 
to remain in institutions 
because his federal disability payments are not enough to pay 
for his care mcafee must depend on medicare and medicaid 
neither federal insurance program will pay for living expenses 
outside an institution although advocates for the disabled say 
such arrangements generally would be less expensive than nursing 
home care 
mcafee said he believes educating lawmakers and the public about 
the things disabled people are forced to endure is the only way of 
changing the system if it doesnt help me i am hoping that at 
least it will help others he said

the supreme court today rejected the appeal of 
a georgia school district ordered to pay lawyer fees incurred in 
administrative hearings by a couple who won a free and 
appropriate education for their handicapped daughter 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the federal 
law guaranteeing educational opportunity for handicapped youngsters 
authorizes such lawyerfee awards 
lawyers for the muscogee county school district had argued that 
lawyer fees may be awarded only when parents who invoke the federal 
law prevail in court not in administrative proceedings 
the school district lawyers told the justices that federal 
appeals courts are divided over the issue of awarding lawyer fees 
incurred in administrative hearings 
the muscogee county controversy began when paige mitten a 
13yearold girl with cerebral palsy partial blindness and mental 
retardation moved with her family to columbus ga in 1985 
paige had been attending public schools in texas where an 
individualized education plan was developed for her 
county school officials refused to permit paige to enter the 
public school system or to develop a new individual education plan 
for her instead they recommended she be placed in a staterun 
center in columbus 
paiges parents objected to placing her in the center but did so 
on a temporary basis 
at an administrative proceeding in late 1985 a regional hearing 
officer ruled that the school district violated the federal 
education of the handicapped act by not providing paige with the 
required free and appropriate education 
school district officials appealed but a state hearing officer 
upheld the regional hearing officers findings 
but the state hearing officer also concluded that the mittens 
would have to sue in federal court in their attempt to recover 
legal fees incurred in their fight to get paige an education 
a federal judge ruled that no lawyerfee awards are available 
under the handicapped childrens protection act for administrative 
proceedings but the 11th us circuit court of appeals reversed 
that ruling last july 20 and ordered the judge to determine how 
much the school district should pay 
the school district then sought supreme court review 
the case is muscogee county school distict vs mitten 89905

the past year with heavy troop presence in the region 
particularly during the last month of renewed unrest at least 27 
people have been killed this year 
serbs in the province today threatened to take up arms to defend 
themselves against what they claim is harassment by the ethnic 
albanian majority if authorities do not take action

away from schools in the province today to protest a state of 
emergency in the region several thousand also demonstrated in the

the white house was aware of the possibility 
that drug traffickers in colombia had surfacetoair missiles in 
advance of president bushs trip last week to a fournation drug 
summit his spokesman said today 
but press secretary marlin fitzwater added that despite 
security concerns over the prospect there was no hard evidence to 
confirm the reports 
on monday guerrillas dynamited a power station and attacked 
police posts in cartagena colombia four days after the drug 
summit there and police seized 10 shoulderfired missiles in 
bogota from drug traffickers authorities said 
asked about the missile seizure fitzwater told reporters i 
dont have specific information there was intelligence before we 
left of various kinds about missiles and rockets and other kinds 
of equipment with various plans 
there is no question that there has been terrorist activities 
in that country and that the kind of people operating there the 
drug cartel were capable of this the spokesman added 
two americans remained in captivity 65yearold james donnelly 
of detroit and 40yearold david kent of indianapolis they were 
kidnapped by guerrillas a week ago in the northwest city of 
medellin 
in cartagena guerrillas dynamited an electric power substation

people and attacked three police posts wounding five officers 
police said 
authorities said the shoulderfired missiles which can shoot 
down planes were found in a raid monday on a bogota drug hideout 
i think we said at the time that we did not have any 
confirmable information that there was a threat for sam7 missiles 
the shouldermounted variety fitzwater said 
to my knowledge that has not changed but theres intelligence 
suggesting all kinds of capabilities and these always have to be 
matters of concern

the supreme court today refused to block a 
state court libel lawsuit against the naacp by a virginia beach 
va white policeman who fatally shot a 22yearold black man 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that the suit 
against the national association for the advancement of colored 
people and one of its officials must be tried in state rather than 
federal court 
eddie upchurch shot and killed fred t gilchrist on june 20 
1987 upchurch said he fired unintentionally when gilchrist tried 
to grab his gun 
aaron wheeler of the local naacp branch was quoted in the 
virginia pilot as calling the shooting a murder 
this is a senseless murder and something has to be done about 
it the newspaper quoted wheeler as saying 
in his libel suit upchurch said wheelers remarks were false 
and that the civil rights official knew they were false or spoke 
them with reckless disregard for the truth the officers suit 
contended that the naacp had approved wheelers comments 
wheeler and the naacp sought to move the case from state to 
federal court to determine whether the the suedover statements 
were assertions of fact or libelproof expressions of opinion 
wheeler and the civil rights group also contended that a black 
accused of libeling a white cannot get a fair trial in virginia 
state courts they cited the lingering viability of an 1847 
state law that said a negro shall be punished with stripes a 
whipping if he uses provoking language or menacing gestures to 
a white person 
us district judge j calvitt clarke jr said there are no 
grounds for believing blacks will be denied fair treatment in 
virginia courts the judge said wheeler and the naacp were unable 
to cite any laws or court cases to support their claims 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals upheld clarkes ruling 
last july 
virginia beach on other occasions has been the scene of racial 
tensions law enforcement officers were accused of civil rights 
violations while quelling a riot among a crowd of 100000 youths 
there over the labor day weekend this year 
police used clubs to disperse the crowds which largely 
consisted of students from predominantly black east coast colleges 
attending the annual endofsummer greekfest 
the case is virginia naacp vs upchurch 89506

pakistani and indian troops 
exchanged fire for several hours today after a pakistani soldier 
became the first military casualty on the troubled kashmir border 
officers and a western observer said 
the soldier was shot in the leg sunday at a ceasefire line 
several miles from the village of chaukothi officials said on 
condition of anonymity 
they said there were no reports of casualties from todays 
firefight at the line which divides kashmir between pakistan and 
india 
the nations have twice gone to war over the himalayan state in 
1948 and again in 1965 the former princely state was divided 
between the two nations after british colonial rule ended in 1947 
relations between the neighbors have become increasingly 
strained since jan 20 when indian troops launched a military 
crackdown on moslem separatists in turbulent jammukashmir 
the militants want indias only majority moslem state to either 
become independent or join pakistan jammukashmir is an aberration 
in india where 82 percent of the countrys 880 million people are 
hindus 
the leaders of both countries have tried to soothe tempers in 
the dispute and have said another war over the region is unlikely 
however pakistani forces have now sealed off the border area at 
chaukothi forbidding civilians from entering the area 
the border crossing was the scene of a bloody confrontation on 
feb 11 between indian troops and pakistani students who were 
marching in solidarity with activists in indianheld kashmir 
indian troops killed three students and wounded several during 
that confrontation a pakistan defence ministry spokesman said the 
two armies also exchanged gunfire for about 30 minutes before calm 
was restored 
a paksitan army captain who said he witnessed the firefight 
said unlike the occasional shootings in the past indian soldiers 
appeared to be aiming at pakistani troops the western observer 
said sundays shooting of the pakistan soldier appeared to back up 
that assertion 
in another sign of increased tensions pakistani and indian 
officers are no longer accompanying united nations military 
observers as they pass through the borders 
it is not a normal situation the officer said the border 
is extremely tense 
pakistan officials said they were taking steps to quell what one 
official called war fever on the pakistan side 
we are trying to tie the people down said amir alan khan a 
retired lieutenant colonel who heads kashmirs civil defence he 
said hundreds of retired soldiers have approached him to ask for 
orders to fight the indian army

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether prosecutors who exclude blacks as jurors because of their 
race violate the rights of white defendants 
the justices said they will review the case of a white ohio man 
larry joe powers convicted of two murders by a state court jury 
after seven blacks who could have served as jurors were excluded 
the high court in 1986 ruled that when prosecutors disqualify 
potential jurors based on their race it violates the 14th 
amendments guarantee of equal protection 
but that case involved a black defendant and black jurors the 
court never has said whether unlawful racial discrimination in jury 
selection occurs when the defendant is of a different race than the 
excluded jurors 
in a decision announced jan 22 however five of the courts 
nine justices implied that excluding blacks as jurors because of 
their race does discriminate unlawfully against white defendants 
the court in that decision ruled that a separate right the 6th 
amendment guarantee of an impartial jury is not violated when 
prosecutors exclude blacks as jurors if the defendants are white 
although it was not an issue in the case five justices 
thurgood marshall william j brennan harry a blackmun john paul 
stevens and anthony m kennedy seemed to agree that such 
racebased exclusions do violate any defendants 14th amendment 
right 
powers was convicted of the july 27 1985 murders in columbus 
of gary golden and thomas kicas he was sentenced to 50 years to 
life in prison 
during jury selection at the trial powers lawyer objected to 
the prosecutions exclusion of the seven black jurors the 
presiding judge overruled the objections 
a state appeals court upheld the convictions

leaders of the governing liberal democratic party 
agreed tuesday that prime minister toshiki kaifu should stay in 
office and form a new cabinet 
because of his weak power base in the party kaifus position 
had been considered uncertain despite an election victory sunday 
that gave the liberal democrats a comfortable majority in the 
powerful lower house of parliament 
kaifu had said he would resign if the party which was formed in 
1955 and has governed japan since lost its majority 
doubt was cast on the partys chances by a widespread 
influencebuying scandal and an unpopular sales tax but it won 275 
of the 512 seats in the lower house which chooses the prime 
minister and controls the budget 
if 14 conservative independents join them as expected the 
liberal democrats will not be far short of their 295 seats in the 
outgoing house 
the leading opposition japan socialist party won 136 seats up 
from 83 the party leader is expected to vote for a leader soon and 
takako doi the chairwoman who led the socialists in sundays 
election is expected to win 
japan national broadcast corp said a socialist election would 
be held march 2526 and no one would challenge mrs doi 
a vote for the socialists was widely viewed as a protest of the 
new 3 percent sales tax and scandals in the ruling party the 
socialists entered only 149 candidates and could not have won a 
majority 
ms doi attributed the outcome to the powerful political 
machines of liberal democrats and support from big business 
sundays results illustrated the tendency of japanese voters to 
forgive indiscretions of the ruling party eventually which has 
helped the liberal democrats weather several scandals 
voters registered their dissatisfaction over the latest one 
which involved insider stock deals and large political 
contributions by the recruit co information conglomerate by 
depriving the party of its majority in the less powerful upper 
house in july 1989 
most senior liberal democrats tied to the scandal were 
reelected sunday including former prime ministers yasuhiro 
nakasone 72 and noboru takeshita 65 and some former cabinet 
ministers nakasone ran as an independent 
dozens of influential business and political figures resigned 
because of the scandal and 12 are being tried for giving or taking 
bribes 
popularity ratings had plummeted when kaifu 59 became prime 
minister in august he was untainted by the recruit affair and 
helped clean up the party image by promising reforms 
kaifu also has promised to ease the sales tax on food and some 
other basic items

despite a strong us plea the soviet union 
is unwilling to renew diplomatic relations with israel or begin 
direct flights of jewish immigrants to tel aviv us officials 
said tuesday 
were disappointed that they have not approved those 
flights marlin fitzwater the white house spokesman said 
but were hopeful it still might happen 
both issues were raised by secretary of state james a baker iii 
with foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze during talks in moscow 
two weeks ago baker also expressed concern about flashes of 
antisemitism particularly threats of pogroms on specified dates 
by antijewish groups 
considering what has happened with armenians the threats are 
not farfetched said a us official who spoke on the condition 
of anonymity the source said baker was told that one of the 
unfortunate results of president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or openness is that nasty views get an airing 
at the white house fitzwater said president bush is concerned 
about reports of growing antisemitism in that country he heard 
from american jewish leaders just a week or two ago who voiced 
great concern on that issue 
soviet relations with israel were broken by moscow in 1967 after 
israel defeated egypt which has been armed by the soviet union 
and other arab states in a mideast war 
in 1988 an israeli delegation including russianspeaking 
jewish emigres went to moscow to check conditions at the former 
israeli embassy a group of soviet diplomats went to tel aviv the 
following spring 
the exchange was generally seen as a move toward restoration of 
relations 
in the meantime israel is restoring ties with soviet allies in 
eastern europe beginning with hungary late last year with 
czechoslovakia on feb 9 and with poland next week discussions are 
under way with east germany and bulgaria romania never broke with 
tel aviv 
asked why moscow was not renewing its ties as well the us 
officials said the soviets replied they were looking into it 
the soviets also cited the settlement of some jewish emigres 
about 100 of the thousands who have poured into israel in the last 
few months on the west bank as a complicating factor 
the bush administration has criticized the settling of jews on 
the west bank and in gaza as an obstacle to peace talks 
additionally the officials said the soviets continue to say 
that israel must take further steps toward the palestinians 
more than 4500 soviet jews emigrated to israel last month as a 
result of gorbachevs lenient emigration policy and us pressure 
over the last several years israeli officials estimate at least 
twice as many would make the exodus if the soviets permitted direct 
flights to tel aviv 
the soviet airline aeroflot and the israeli airline el al signed 
an agreement last year for direct flights it was due to be 
implemented jan 1 
when baker asked about the delay the soviets werent 
encouraging an official said 
they didnt specifically say they are never going to do it 
the source said they cited problems with the arabs about 
settlements and soviet immigrants we pointed out the number on the 
west bank are minuscule 
and yet the official said they clearly did not encourage us 
they were going to move on this soon 
the administration is eager to have the air accord implemented 
because us admission of soviet jewish refugees is limited to 
50000 under a quota set by president bush in october thousands 
more are able to leave 
at the same time the administration is closing us processing 
centers in vienna and rome where thousands of jews who left with 
exit permits for israel are waiting to be resettled in the united 
states 
we believe that direct flights would be helpful in increasing 
the number of people that can get out fitzwater said 
last friday the administration concluded an agreement with the 
council of jewish federations and the hebrew immigrant aid society 
to fly up to 8000 refugees most of them jews to the united 
states 
the jewish groups will pay for processing and transporting the 
refugees and also their medical examinations placement and 
initial resettlement for two years after they enter the country 
the estimated cost is about 30 million

that former abc anchorwoman paula zahn will succeed kathleen 
sullivan as coanchor of cbs this morning starting monday 
cbs formal announcement came after two weeks of news reports 
that the move was pending sullivan indirectly confirmed the shift 
during her farewell to viewers friday her cbs contract expires in 
november 
erik sorenson the programs executive producer said today that 
it wasnt so much that we wanted to replace kathleen as that we

you make

began in november 1987 like zahn she was a morning news 
anchorwoman at abc before joining cbs 
sorenson said cbs officials were impressed with zahn when she 
recently filled in for joan lunden on abcs good morning

and shed be available for contract talks he said he quoted the 
agent richard leibner as saying there were only eight days in 
february when shed be available 
sorenson said he and cbs news president david burke spent three 
days weighing the pros and cons of hiring zahn 33 and it was 
not an easy decision because kathleen is a helluva broadcaster

hadnt exactly been going through the roof and there was a need 
to make a longrange decision for the show

the campaign has been contentious 
filled with threats and accusations of foul play but international 
observers say chances are good that sundays election will be clean 
credibility is a critical issue in an election that amounts to a 
referendum on a decade of sandinista rule 
both sides rely on the observers to ensure a fair election but 
for different reasons 
president daniel ortega and the sandinistas expect to win and 
approval by the observers will lend legitimacy the united national 
opposition whose presidential candidate is violeta barrios de 
chamorro says only international observers will keep the 
sandinistas from cheating 
more than 1000 observers are fanning out by jeep boat plane 
and horseback to watch the election from the first votes cast to 
the last counting 
one of the most visible observers is jimmy carter the former 
us president who denounced cheating in last years panamanian 
election while the votes were being counted his prestige and anger 
helped destroy the credibility of the election which gen manuel 
antonio noriega later nullified 
the largest observer missions are from the organization of 
american states which has 450 people and the united nations with 
200 
nicaragua is the first country to invite un election 
observers sandinista officials hope a verified victory will bring 
better relations with washington and international aid for an 
economy ravaged by mismanagement war with ussupported contra 
rebels and a us economic embargo 
a credible election can be the foundation for getting us out 
of this crisis said adolfo beteta spokesman for the supreme 
electoral council there has never been an election with more 
observers 
since the sandinistas overthrew president anastasio somoza in 
1979 nicaraguas economy has shrunk by more than half wages have 
fallen to less than 10 percent of their former value and private 
consumption is down by 70 percent the currency was devalued 39 
times in 1989 
officials of the un and oas observer missions and a 
representative of carters council of freely elected heads of 
government have been in nicaragua for months 
they have mediated disputes about opposition access to 
statecontrolled media use of government resources by the 
sandinistas intimidation campaign violence and many other 
subjects 
i expect a clean election but if there are irregularities on 
a large scale we will be able to detect them said jennifer 
mccoy head of the carter mission 
leonel zuniga of the oas said his observers plan to visit 2500 
of the nations 4391 polling places many unofficial observers 
will help from us congressmen to church workers 
between the oas and the other observers i would guess almost 
100 percent of the polling places will be covered zuniga said 
we hope for and we expect a clean election 
to keep them from voting more than once citizens will have to 
dip their fingers in bright blue ink that takes days to wash off 
to prevent stuffing of ballot boxes each precinct will be assigned 
a number chosen by poll watchers when it opens and the number will 
be stamped on every ballot 
ballots will be counted twice once at the precinct and at one 
of nine regional centers international observers will watch the 
counting at many precincts and all regional centers 
the un and the oas missions will get copies of the returns 
and will do their own sample counts to check against official 
returns 
some potential problems still exist voter identification cards 
do not bear photographs and each side accuses the other of buying 
cards stealing them or duping people into giving them up 
leaders of the opposition alliance known as uno express 
concern that their poll watchers will be frightened into resigning 
before the election but say they expect to have people at about 95 
percent of the voting stations 
angelica hunt spokeswoman for the un mission said were a 
deterrence our presence makes a difference but its absolutely 
essential for uno and the other opposition parties to have their 
poll watchers in place

the nuclear regulatory commission announced 
today that it will decide on march 1 whether to license the 
seabrook nuclear power plant setting the stage for an intense 
legal battle 
the commission is expect to approve the licensing and 
challenges to that decision are considered certain 
plant spokesman ron sher said preparations for fullpower 
operation would begin immediately after a license is issued he 
said the gradual ascension to fullpower commercial operation would 
take two to three months although the plant would produce a small 
amount of electricity within a month 
a key question for whatever court handles the promised appeals 
to a license would be deciding whether to stay operation of the 
plant pending resolution of the appeals 
the 64 billion plant the scene of huge antinuclear 
demonstrations in the late 1970s and 1980s was completed in 
mid1986 it has remained idle for lack of a federal operating 
license mainly because massachusetts officials contend that the 
safety of people living around the plant could not be assured in 
case of a major accident 
the federally mandated 10mile emergency planning zone around 
the 1150megawatt reactor includes six massachusetts communities 
challenges to a license also allege flaws in emergency plans for 
new hampshire towns 
seabrook critics including massachusetts attorney general james 
shannon have said the issuance of a license by the nrc is a 
foregone conclusion and that the real fight will be in court 
shannon and others argue that while nrc officials have deemed 
emergency evacuation plans for seabrook adequate to protect the 
public safety the commission has never spelled out its definition 
of adequate 
commission chairman kenneth carr said in january that such broad 
issues would not be addressed in the nrc decision on seabrook carr 
said the decision will instead focus on specific issues directly 
relating to the plant 
a 1979 new hampshire law targeted at seabrook bars utilities 
from charging their customers for unfinished and canceled power 
plants 
unable to bill customers for seabrook and faced with repeated 
cost increases and delays seabrooks main owner public service 
company of new hampshire entered bankruptcy reorganization two 
years ago a proposed settlement calls for public service to be 
acquired by connecticutbased northeast utilities

defense secretary dick cheney arrived tuesday from 
the philippines seeking what the united states hopes will be a 
sizable increase in japans 24 billion annual support for 
american troops stationed here 
cheneys visit came as philippine president corazon aquino 
signaled a willingness to work out differences over us bases 
there despite her refusal to meet with cheney during his stay in 
manila the previous three days 
the defense secretary had a warmer reception in tokyo 
the japanese are very understanding and are very willing to 
help us as much as they can said a senior pentagon official 
traveling with cheney 
and even though it was known that cheney intended to explore 
with japanese officials possible 10 percent to 12 percent cuts in 
us troop levels in asia japanese government spokesman taizo 
watanabe said officials were not worried by such a development 
the positive tone set by both sides at the opening of cheneys 
visit was in marked contrast to the scenes he has encountered at 
the other major stops on his twoweek asian tour 
in manila the defense secretary was burned in effigy by 
demonstrators who protested us military bases in their country 
in seoul cheney met with south korean officials who were described 
as horrified by his costcutting messages and projections of 
possible troop reductions 
despite the coolness of his manila stopover mrs aquino said 
tuesday i welcome the statement of support for this government 
and philippine democracy made by secretary cheney on behalf of the 
united states 
i also welcome his reiteration that the united states will 
make its best efforts to meet its pledge for foreign assistance 
she said referring to a 96 million reduction in money for the use 
of six military bases this year 
the military sessions in tokyo appear free of the tense 
wrangling that scars the two nations economic relations given 
that the united states looks to japan as the anchor of its asian 
military strategy and the japanese prosper under the protective 
us military wing 
the japanese are the linchpin of our military strategy in 
asia the us official said speaking on condition of anonymity 
theyre very supportive of our presence 
cheney was expected to tell the japanese what he already has 
told the south koreans that he is under congressional pressure to 
get them to double over the next three years their financial 
support for basing us troops in their countries 
the official traveling with cheney said the defense secretary 
did not intend to press the japanese to put forward an exact amount 
at this juncture each year the japanese provide around 24 
billion of the 7 billion it costs america to base the 50000 
troops here and in okinawa 
we do not have any numbers were confident they 
understand our requirements the official said adding were 
hopeful that over the years well see a sizable increase in 
japanese support for us forces here 
the us official said washington had received indications of 
such increased support from japanese officials during preliminary 
talks leading up to the cheney visit 
pentagon sources have said they are studying plans by which at 
least 10000 to 12000 troops could be withdrawn from the 120000 
based in the pacific rim nations that would mean a reduction of 
5000 troops in japan 
the study is part of a reassessment of the us military role in 
the pacific that cheney must send to capitol hill by april 1 some 
lawmakers are demanding cuts in overseas forces in light of reduced 
superpower tensions 
the official traveling with cheney said the japanese didnt 
appear to be disturbed by a reduction in noncombatant troops 
given that they face much less of a direct threat than south korea 
does and also because they are more concerned about the longterm 
us presence in their arena 
we understand the us congress is looking for ways to reduce 
government expenditures and as long as the united states 
fundamental position has not changed we are not worried 
watanabe said 
cheneys japanese counterpart juro matsumoto also expressed 
understanding of the american position he said that while the 
united states may carry out some streamlining it has no 
intention of reducing its fighting strength 
cheneys schedule here is a mix of business and pleasure as he 
lunches with some influential japanese citizens and visits us 
troops at the yokosuka naval base on wednesday he confers with 
japanese officials nearly the entire day on thursday 
after delivering a speech on usasian relations friday at the 
national press club the secretary was to be taken by japans famed 
highspeed bullet train for a trip to the ancient city of kyoto 
he was scheduled to return to washington on saturday

jurors in the trial of extanker 
captain joseph hazelwood saw a videotape today of the exxon valdez 
stranded on a reef surrounded by a sea of black oil 
the tape which graphically depicted the disaster caused when 
the tanker struck bligh reef last march 24 was introduced in 
evidence by the prosecution 
daniel lawn an environmental engineer with alaskas department 
of environmental conservation testified that he shot the footage 
after he was summoned by the coast guard to visit the stricken ship 
and record details of the nations worst oil spill 
he called the tape mental notetaking explaining how he 
accompanied coast guard investigators to the 987foot ship 
the tape which lasted about 10 minutes first showed the ship 
sitting in the darkness its lights glowing the video then 
switched to a period after dawn when the ships deck was more 
visible and a contrast was shown between the gooey black oil on one 
side of the tanker and the clear blue water on the other 
also visible were chunks of ice which the vessel had sought to 
elude in its course into prince william sound 
long narrated the tape showingwhich tanks were leaking oil 
saying at one point you can see it bubbling out 
the tape was offered as prosecutors began a final barrage of 
evidence aimed at proving that hazelwood skipper of the ship was 
drunk and reckless the night the tanker went aground 
after two weeks of testimony from 23 witnesses assistant 
district attorneys brent cole and mary ann henry plan to conclude 
their case late this week or early next 
on friday coast guard investigator mark delozier told of 
boarding the grounded tanker in the early morning hours of march 24 
and confronting hazelwood who smelled of liquor he said the smell 
was very intense and very obvious 
delozier also testified that in the captains quarters he found 
two empty cans of a lowalcohol beer he said there were more cans 
of the beer in a refrigerator 
the defense may cite the presence of the beer to explain why 
hazelwood tested positive on a bloodalcohol test administered 10 
hours after the exxon valdez grounding and some 15 hours after he 
was seen at a bar in valdez the blood test showed hazelwood had a 
blood alcohol level of 061 under the limit for driving in alaska 
but above the federal limit for operating a commercial vessel 
the 43yearold skipper is charged with second degree criminal 
mischief a felony and three misdemeanors reckless endangerment 
operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of 
oil if convicted his maximum penalties could be 7 years in 
prison plus 61000 in fines 
the exxon valdez a 987foot tanker ran aground on jagged bligh 
reef gashing holes in its oil tanks and spilling almost 11 million 
gallons of oil into the clear waters of prince william sound 
the spill was the nations largest killing countless birds 
fish and wildlife and blackening hundreds of miles of rocky shore 
deloziers testimony focused on the muchdebated question of 
whether hazelwood was drunk at the time of the accident testimony 
has been inconclusive on how many drinks hazelwood had during an 
afternoon in the town of valdez before the ship sailed 
ships officers who accompanied him say he had two or three 
drinks over a period of about three hours the prosecution 
maintains he was in a bar for about six hours and kept ordering 
vodka on the rocks 
the only point on which all witnesses seem to agree is that 
hazelwood never appeared to be drunk on the exxon valdez even 
delozier who smelled alcohol on him said he did not stagger slur 
his words or appear impaired by alcohol 
superior court judge karl johnstone was considering a 
prosecution proposal to call as witnesses experts who claim they 
can tell from listening to tape recordings of a persons voice 
whether they are intoxicated prosecutors want the experts to give 
their opinions about hazelwood from listening to the tape of the 
skipper reporting the exxon valdez grounding to the us coast 
guard

a settlement was reached today in a 
negligence case against a 92yearold widow who stood to lose her 
home and life savings for helping her nephew buy a car that later 
was involved in a serious accident 
luella wilson refused all pretrial settlements proclaiming 
i want a trial by jury arriving at the courthouse this 
morning wilson said she would take the stand in her own defense 
if i am able 
its the only way i can clear my name she said i didnt 
do nothing wrong its terrible what happened to that boy but im 
not responsible for what happened 
details of the settlement were not released but wilson claimed 
victory saying she will keep her home and property the agreement 
came during the noon hour after lawyers had presented opening 
arguments and testimony had begun 
wilson had been found negligent for giving her greatnephew 
money to buy a car that later was involved in an accident that left 
a man partially paralyzed the case was being heard again to decide 
if that negligence should be shared 
on monday wilson was presented with a number of settlement 
offers most of which would have left her home and assets to the 
accident victim when she died 
she refused them all my husband harry would roll over in his 
grave if i ever did that she said 
the trial struck a sympathetic chord with the public because 
wilson stood to lose 950000 the value of her home 80 acres of 
property and her savings after her story appeared in newspapers 
and on television wilson received letters of support and cash from 
around the nation 
legal experts and professional groups including bankers and car 
dealerships kept a close eye on the case because it could mark a 
legal precedent for negligence 
had the trial gone to the jury wilson an automobile dealership 
and its president would have had to prove they were not negligent 
in helping wilsons greatnephew willard stuart buy a car in 1984 
stuart had no drivers license or insurance at the time 
shortly after he bought the car stuart drove it off a bridge 
after drinking beer and whiskey and smoking marijuana with a group 
of young men including mark vince according to court records 
vince a backseat passenger was partially paralyzed as a 
result of the accident and later had one leg amputated he sued 
wilson for negligence under the legal concept of negligent 
entrustment for giving her nephew 6300 to buy the 1981 chrysler 
lebaron 
prosecutors claimed that wilson was negligent not by buying the 
car outright but by providing the money for the nephew to purchase 
it a 1987 superior court jury agreed and awarded vince 950000 
wilson was too ill to attend that trial 
while refusing to reverse that decision on appeal the vermont 
supreme court later ruled that a jury should decide if ace auto of 
bennington and its president and salesman in the deal gary 
gardner should share the liability for selling the car to stuart 
after the high courts ruling superior court judge arthur odea 
opened the way for a retrial saying jurors could also decide if 
vince shares the liability for entering the car when he knew the 
driver had been drinking and smoking marijuana

solidarity leader lech walesa met tuesday 
with world jewish congress president edgar bronfman and pledged to 
oppose antisemitism in poland 
bronfman continuing a visit to poland that included meetings 
monday with president wojciech jaruzelski and prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki also traveled to the auschwitz concentration 
camp in southern poland 
there is nothing to be said here only the wail remains 
bronfman wrote in the visitors book at the camp where officials 
estimate up to 25 million jews were killed by the nazis during 
world war ii 
during the meeting with walesa bronfman expressed concern about 
what he termed a reappearance of antisemitism in poland 
noting that there are only 10000 jews left in all of poland 
compared with a preworld war ii population of 35 million he said 
it was unprecedented for antisemitism to remain in a country where 
there are so few jews 
he asked walesa for a public condemnation of antisemitism 
i have condemned antisemitism everywhere walesa replied 
i have always been doing so and i will do so 
walesa called it a great loss that there are so few jews in 
poland 
jews have lived in poland for nearly 1000 years and made up 10 
percent of polands population before world war ii but despite 
that long history of coexistence relations between polish 
catholics and polish jews have often been marked by tension and 
hostility 
the solidarityled government of mazowiecki has pledged to 
improve polishjewish relations and oppose any resurgence of 
antisemitism 
it plans to restore diplomatic relations with israel next week 
and has moved to speed up construction of an alternate home for 
roman catholic nuns whose convent next to auschwitz has offended 
jews and others

a team of surgeons worked about 10 hours today 
to replace the diseased liver of 12yearold stormie jones who 
became the worlds first recipient of a heartliver transplant six 
years ago 
lead surgeon andreas tzakis and six other doctors started the 
operation at 315 am and finished at about 1 pm hospital 
officials said transplant pioneer dr thomas starzl was present 
for part of the procedure 
the word was everything went fine said childrens hospital 
spokeswoman lynn mcmahon stormie was listed in critical condition 
considered normal following transplant surgery 
stormie and her mother lois purcell flew to pittsburgh from 
their home in the dallas suburb of white settlement texas on 
monday arriving at the hospital about 7 pm 
as she was wheeled from her plane to a waiting ambulance 
stormie joked i feel like im in a straitjacket because of the 
stretchers confining straps 
doctors were optimistic because a donor liver was found only a 
week after stormies name was placed on the nationwide transplant 
list the success rate of a second liver transplant is estimated at 
65 percent to 70 percent hospital officials said 
hepatitis damaged stormies first transplanted liver and the 
organ no longer functions normally said mcmahon 
hepatitis which is caused by a viral infection inflames the 
liver 
she was last hospitalized here in january mcmahon said 
the doctors suspected a virus or hepatitis at that time they 
feel at this time their only option is another liver transplant 
stormies first transplant on valentines day 1984 took 16 hours 
and was headed by starzl who replaced the girls heart and liver 
with those of a 4yearold girl who had died in a new york car 
accident 
before that operation stormie suffered two heart attacks and 
underwent two triple coronary bypass operations 
she suffered from a rare congenital disease which increased to 
10 times normal the level of cholesterol in her blood the 
imbalance was caused by a faulty liver 
pittsburgh surgeons followed stormies 1984 operation with two 
more attempts at heartliver transplants but both patients died 
within a few days of surgery 
those were the only attempts in america at replacing a heart and 
liver in the same operation until last dec 3 when pittsburgh 
surgeons performed the worlds first heartliverkidney transplant 
the patient cindy martin 26 remains in critical condition in the 
intensive care unit at presbyterianuniversity hospital 
she is receiving fk506 an experimental japanese drug and has 
experienced no organ rejection 
stormie had no serious complications until october 1988 when 
childrens hospital doctors removed a bile duct obstruction she 
started losing liver function and returned to childrens hospital 
in november

the soviet legislature on tuesday urged a 
crackdown on illegal demonstrations scheduled for sunday and said 
authorities should exercise tight control on legal rallies the 
tass news agency reported 
the legislators saying they feared that extremists and criminal 
elements will exploit the demonstrations to destabilize the 
political situation adopted a resolution urging law enforcement 
agencies to take special measures to keep demonstrators in line 
the rallies were organized by various political groups in 
moscow leningrad and other major cities to express their 
attitude to changes taking place in the country tass said 
as far as newspaper reports indicate forces interested in 
destabilizing the situation also intend to join the 
demonstrators the news agency said 
the resolution introduced in the supreme soviet legislature by 
deputy nikolai pivovarov said unsanctioned rallies should be 
curbed and legal demonstrations be held in specifically assigned 
places 
in order to prevent actions by militants and possibly 
criminal forces the supreme soviet has asked the government and 
local authorities to adopt all necessary measures to protect law 
and order tass said 
the news agency quoted several deputies as saying there had been 
an increase in demonstrations under the perestroika reforms of 
president mikhail s gorbachev and that many of them had taken on 
an antistate character with some demonstrators exhorting people 
to violence 
the predominant motive of many rallies is usually down with 
something or away with something an unidentified deputy and 
member of the committee on glasnost was quoted as saying during the 
debate on the resolution 
antistate remarks that sometimes contain open appeals for 
violence have become a permanent fixture of their vocabulary he 
was quoted as saying 
tass said the resolution was adopted after the debate but did 
not break down the vote 
the supreme soviet on tuesday also approved a bill that would 
allow individuals to own land but sent it to committee for 
refinement before voting on an articlebyarticle basis that is 
expected next week 
land currently is the property of the state and passage of the 
law would also require reworking of the constitution some 
lawmakers expressed concern the law could disrupt farm production 
a law that would allow individuals to hold private property was 
sent back to a committee for revision last week both bills are 
intended to unleash individual initiative by giving citizens a 
greater say in how they live

the white house said tuesday that the secret 
service had known there was a possibility that drug terrorists had 
surfacetoair missiles when president bush flew to colombia for 
last weeks fournation drug summit ten such weapons were seized 
by colombian police monday 
there was intelligence before we left of various kinds about 
missiles and rockets and other kinds of equipment about people 
with various plans said presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
but he added that the reports were difficult to confirm at the 
time 
the weapons seized monday in a raid on a bogota drug hidout were 
capable of downing large aircraft two men were arrested 
bushs meeting thursday with presidents virgilio barco of 
colombia alan garcia of peru and jaime paz zamora of bolivia in 
the port city of cartagena was held amid extremely tight security 
security preparations included manuevers to lessen the chance of 
a missile attack on the presidential aircraft 
air force one did not fly directly into cartagena where the 
approach would have been over land but into a more secure airport 
in barranquilla where the approach was over the sea hhis 
helicopter then flew fast and low into cartagena accompanied by 
four other copters that zigzagged in a diversionary pattern 
the helicopters took a roundabout route to stay over water as 
much as possible 
bush had brushed aside concerns of some senior aides in deciding 
to attend the summit the officials expressed deep relief on the 
return trip once air force one was out of colombian air space 
fitzwater who was asked at his daily white house news briefing 
about the weapons seizure said warnings that the terrorists had 
shoulderheld sa7 missiles and might use them against the 
president were not deemed to be confirmable information 
theres intelligence suggesting all kinds of capabilities that 
always have to be matters of concern but nothing that we could 
confirm he said 
suffice to say that the secret service was aware of these 
kinds of activities there but i would not specifically say what we 
knew and didnt know fitzwater said 
we dont talk about security information because we dont want 
others to know how much we know and how we find it out and how we 
work with other governments to get these kinds of information and 
for political reasons it does no good to try to embarrass the 
host country fitzwater said

angola and cuba agreed tuesday to resume a 
withdrawal of cuban troops from the african nation one month after 
the pullout was suspended the angolan foreign minister said 
the withdrawal of the estimated 28000 cubans still in angola 
would start again sunday to comply with usbrokered regional 
peace accords signed in december 1988 by the two countries and 
south africa said foreign minister pedro de castro van dunem 
it is a sovereign decision of angola and cuba that 
reflects our political maturity he said 
van dunem headed the angolan delegation at talks with cuba that 
began monday and led to the decision which also was announced by 
the cuban news agency prensa latina 
havana suspended the troop withdrawal jan 25 after four cubans 
died in an attack by rebels of the national union for the total 
independence of angola known as unita the incident occurred in 
western angola above the 13th parallel currently the southernmost 
limit for havanas soldiers according to the peace accord 
van dunem said the two nations adopted a declaration requesting 
us guarantees to prevent the rebel attacks on cubans he said the 
attacks endangered the new york accords 
van dunem also criticized us aid to unita and what he called 
washingtons not very positive attitude toward angolas marxist 
government 
we would like the united states to cease its interference in 
the angolan question van dunem said were sure that if they 
want to use their influence with unita there will be no more 
attacks on cubans 
unita chief jonas savimbi in a broadcast on the rebels black 
cockerel radio tuesday said there was no proof cuban soldiers 
fought in a recent government offensive 
he said he sent a letter to cuban leader fidel castro 
apologizing for the january attack in which seven cubans were also 
wounded 
we guaranteed castro the death of the cuban soldiers was 
involuntary and that no such incident will be repeated savimbi 
said its in our interests that the cubans go home 
unita receives a reported 50 million a year in us assistance 
including sophisticated groundtoair stinger missiles 
the government forces are equipped with soviet weapons 
more than 31000 cubans of an estimated 50000 were withdrawn 
before the jan 25 suspension under the new york accords 33000 
are to have left by april 1 all are to be gone by mid1991 
fighting has flared in recent weeks in southeast angola where 
government and rebel troops are battling for control of a strategic 
airstrip and rebel base near mavinga 700 miles southeast of luanda 
a unita statement tuesday in lisbon portugal said rebels 
attacked government soldiers carrying supplies to troops near 
mavinga it said monday that rebels bombarded a government garrison 
at cuito cuanavale 90 miles to the northwest 
the statement repeated rebel claims that sovietsupplied 
government planes were dropping chemical bombs behind unita lines 
south of mavinga 
a separate unita statement said seven experts from austria 
belgium france and spain arrived tuesday at rebel headquarters in 
jamba 120 miles south of mavinga to verify the claims 
unita also said its forces killed 13 government fighters sunday 
at barraca garrison bengo province near luanda 
there was no independent confirmation of the claims but the 
angolan state news agency said 10 rebels died in clashes in central 
huambo cuanza south and benguela provinces last week 
the battle for mavinga said to be the heaviest in the 15year 
conflict has darkened hopes of getting government and rebel 
representatives back to the negotiating table

they were bottled after last weeks worldwide recall the company 
said tuesday 
source perrier sa told its domestic distributors that its 
representatives would visit them in the next week to collect 
bottles withdrawn from sale 
perrier representatives at the companys headquarters were 
unavailable to say when the bottled water might return to the 
united states and other foreign markets 
when the recall was announced feb 14 company executives said 
2 months might be needed to withdraw 160 million bottles from sale 
in 120 countries and replace them with water without the 
cancercausing chemical benzene

several countries including the united states where 72 million 
bottles have been pulled off the shelves

the state department said tuesday that cuba 
has received a new shipment of highperformance soviet fighter 
planes that the united states simply cannot tolerate such 
developments 
under questioning department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
denied that the statement constituted a threat to cuba she 
referred reporters to recent testimony before a soviet legislative 
committee by secretary of state james a baker iii in which he said 
cuba posed no threat to the united states 
in confirming a delivery of new mig29 jet fighters ms 
tutwiler gave no figure the washington times which reported the 
shipment in tuesdays editions put the number at six 
the report said the combined total of migs in cubas arsenal has 
now risen to more than 300 most of them older models 
ms tutwiler noted baker had told the soviet legislators during 
a visit to moscow two weeks ago that the united states has 
difficulty understanding why the kremlin continues to send mig29s 
to cuba particularly at a time when cuba has been so critical of 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs reform policies 
ms tutwiler also quoted baker as saying cuba is actively 
supporting the insurgency in el salvador and it is these kind of 
activities close to the shores of the united states that we simply 
cannot tolerate 
initially ms tutwiler dismissed as hypothetical a question 
as to whether the statement was meant as a threat to cuba she 
later said no threat had been intended 
ms tutwiler also attached little significance to the internal 
reforms announced recently by the cuban communist party 
she said the reforms appear aimed at consolidating the strength 
of cubas oneparty system 
the announcement ms tutwiler added distances cuba from the 
current wave of reform sweeping eastern europe by rejecting any 
attempt to duplicate foreign models permit democratic processes or 
allow a multiparty system 
in other words the cuban government seems committed to 
maintaining a rigid oneparty marxistleninist dictatorship the 
very system which socialist states in other parts of the world are 
now reforming

rival christian forces reinforced their 
positions tuesday and mediators sought ways to end a 3weekold war 
for supremacy that has killed more than 650 people most of them 
civilians 
a ceasefire agreed upon saturday by gen michel aoun and samir 
geagea commander of the lebanese forces militia appeared to be 
holding sniper fire could be heard throughout the day in christian 
east beirut but no major battles were reported 
the 19000 troops loyal to aoun trucked in large quantities of 
arms and ammunition to bases in the east beirut districts of furn 
elshubbak tahwita and horsh tabet 
in adjacent ashrafiyeh one of two militia strongholds in east 
beirut lebanese forces chief of staff fuad malek inspected 
positions and said his men were prepared to fight on if necessary 
the lebanese forces fighters are ready to teach the 
attackers a new lesson said malek a retired army major general 
ashrafiyeh cannot be taken 
ashrafiyeh on beiruts highest hill commands the network of 
roads linking areas held by aoun with beirut port which the 
militia controls 
aoun appeared to have backed off a weekend ultimatum to geagea 
to surrender the port and east beiruts karantina district his 
headquarters area next to ashrafiyeh by tuesday night or face an 
allout assault 
a source close to the threemember mediation committee said it 
had succeeded in extending the truce on a daytoday basis but 
that amounted to little more than the hope that an agreement of 
some sort might emerge 
aoun attacked geagea on jan 30 trying to establish sole 
authority over the 310squaremile enclave east and north of 
beirut where 1 million christians live the lebanese forces with 
6000 regulars and thousands of reservists is lebanons largest 
christian militia 
police say 667 people had been killed and 1872 wounded in the 
worst fighting between christians in a moslemchristian civil war 
that has cost more than 150000 lives since april 1975 
the generals forces control about onethird of the christian 
enclave and geagea holds the rest 
they agreed monday to a sixpoint plan designed to consolidate 
the truce but it falls far short of an overall settlement many 
observers see it as a temporary compromises allowing both sides to 
regroup 
geagea agreed to formation of an eightman national 
authority in the enclave under aouns leadership the source 
close to the mediators said but he added even if aoun goes 
along with this it would not mean that a political settlement has 
been reached 
he said there were no indications aoun would drop his demand 
the lebanese forces be disbanded and turned into a political party 
or that geagea would accept it 
mediators met with aoun tuesday in his bunker beneath the 
shattered presidential palace in baabda a christian suburb east of 
beirut 
president elias hrawi elected by parliament in november with a 
mandate to implement a lebanese peace plan aoun opposes dismissed 
him as military commander but the general will not step aside aoun 
does not recognize hrawis authority and refuses to turn over the 
presidential palace

the suburb of tukwila has achieved fame or 
embarrassment with a newspaper column that has made the town a 
euphemism for an act between two consenting adults 
reaction in tukwila to the towns new civic image ranges from 
rage to amusement and some folks feel any advertising for the town 
is good advertising 
it began when seattle times columnist eric lacitis wrote 
recently about rex and debby allen who volunteered the information 
that they had sex 500 times in nine months last year they kept 
track on their calendar mrs allen said 
lacitis decided to use the euphemism visiting tukwila for 
the activity in which the allens engaged so often 
the allens are considering printing bumper stickers reading 
have you gone to tukwila today 
but the tukwila city council denounced the column 
were tired of tukwila being known as the rodney dangerfield 
of king county we get no respect declared councilman clarence 
moriwaki 
whenever people need something to poke fun at they think of 
tukwila said councilman joe duffie its a big disgrace to the 
city 
a local television comedy show almost live created a skit 
called visiting tukwila which produced such other euphemisms 
for the same activity riding the monorail working at 
boeing and shooting herschel the collective name given 
troublesome sea lions that eat steelhead trout swimming through on 
their way to spawn 
tukwila was previously most famous as the site of a shopping 
mall and city administrator john mcfarland commented any 
publicity thats in fun or positive we dont mind he noted that 
tukwila is derived from an indian phrase meaning land of the 
hazelnuts 
carlo macri a 26year tukwila resident also said the free 
advertising is just fine 
im not offended at all he said in an interview at a local 
bar the more recognition we get the better 
in the meantime allen 37 an engineering inspector and his 
wife a 29yearold technician have set a goal of 750 visits to 
tukwila for 1990 
there are worse things we could do mrs allen said

space shuttle atlantis due to lift 
off thursday on a secret military mission faces a 70 percent 
chance of delay due to threatening high winds clouds and 
thunderstorms nasa said tuesday 
despite the dismal forecast nasa officials said the countdown 
that began sunday was continuing smoothly 
everythings still going smoothly no hitches whatsoever 
said space agency spokeswoman lisa malone weather is the only 
issue right now 
forecasters said a front that moved through monday night had 
stalled south of cape canaveral and was expected to shift back to 
the north on wednesday night on monday the weather forecast had 
been 60 percent favorable but dropped overnight as the weather 
system advanced 
a low cloud cover prevented the astronauts from taking part 
early tuesday morning in routine practice flights aboard a shuttle 
training aircraft instead the five men reviewed flight data and 
prepared for a possible practice flight wednesday nasa spokesman 
kyle herring said 
the astronauts were in bed by early afternoon adjusting their 
hours to match the sleep time they will have in space from about 
noon to 8 pm 
because of the secrecy surrounding the mission nasa was not 
providing precise countdown information and would say only that 
liftoff will occur between midnight and 4 am thursday it will 
make the count public nine minutes before the planned blastoff 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said atlantis will 
lift off at 1 am 
atlantis is the sixth flight in 34 missions dedicated solely to 
a national security payload officials say the secrecy makes it 
harder for soviet reconnaissance satellites and a spy ship off cape 
canaveral to track the shuttle and learn its mission 
the sources said the astronauts are to deploy a 37300pound 
satellite to snap highresolution reconnaissance photos and to 
listen in on military and diplomatic communications around the 
world 
they said the shuttle will be launched into an orbit that will 
fly over most of the soviet union 
the satellite known by the code name afp731 and other 
reconniassance spacecraft will help verify whether the soviets are 
complying with ussoviet disarmament agreements being forged the 
soviets have their own spy satellites to monitor us compliance

health secretary louis sullivan continued his 
campaign against tobacco companies tuesday and issued a report 
showing that smoking costs the country more than 52 billion 
annually in health care costs and lost productivity 
sullivan condemned tobacco company advertising practices that 
target women minorities and young people saying they must stop 
their irresponsibility 
in testimony before the senate labor and human resources 
committee he also called on advertising agencies to join 
antismoking efforts by renouncing tobacco ads and said television 
stations should donate free air time to help educate viewers about 
the dangers of smoking 
sullivan also said that while the bush administration supports 
the intent of legislation to increase regulation of tobacco 
products and educate about the risks of smoking it believes the 
bill which would cost an estimated 185 million is unnecessary 
the tobacco product education and health protection act of 1990 
would establish a center as part of the federal centers for disease 
control to expand education efforts on smoking conduct 
smokingrelated research and regulate tobacco products much as the 
food and drug administration regulates food products 
the center also would administer a paid advertising program to 
discourage smoking and provide incentive grants to states to 
encourage enactment and better enforcement of laws prohibiting the 
sale of tobacco to minors 
sullivan said his department yearly spends about 79 million on 
antismoking programs many of which duplicate the efforts proposed 
in the legislaton 
he said free public service announcements about the risks of 
smoking are preferable to governmentpaid ads in light of other 
demands on the federal budget he also said that regulating the 
additives in cigarettes envisioned in the bill would send the 
wrong message 
were concerned that this would suggest that we believe that 
under certain conditions with certain monitoring that tobacco is 
safe he said we would rather see our efforts on reducing and 
elmiminating by the year 2000 all tobacco from our society 
however sen edward kennedy dmass and chairman of the senate 
committee noted that bottled perrier water was pulled from the 
market when it was found to contain benzene at levels up to four 
times what is allowed under federal standards while a surgeon 
generals report estimated the benzene content of cigarettes is 
2000 times higher than that 
the consumer has a right to know the key ingredients and 
additives to a pack of cigarettes when they purchase the product 
kennedy said 
sullivan agreed that consumers should have such information 
charles o whitley representing the tobacco institute noted in 
testimony submitted to the committee that congress previously 
considered and rejected disclosure of ingredient information 
because it contains trade secrets this information is supplied to 
the health and human services secretary but it does not identify 
the company or brand of cigarettes 
whitley also said other provisions in the bill arent needed 
because young people are already aware of the risks of smoking he 
also denied that the industry targets young people in advertising 
campaigns to encourage them to take up the habit 
he also defended the industry against critics who say that 
tobacco companies target women and minorities saying the industry 
is not trying to encourage people to start smoking but rather hopes 
to retain or gain market share from competitors 
sullivan released a report on the economic consequences of 
smoking that estimated smokingrelated disease costs each american 
221 a year largely in healthcare and insurance costs 
he said the costs average 1 billion per state annually but 
range from a high of 58 billion in california to a low of 82 
million in alaska the reports analysis the first of its kind is 
based on 1985 statistics 
smoking causes an estimated 390000 deaths in the united states 
annually and about 29 percent of adults smoke he said 
sullivan recently criticized rj reynolds tobacco co for its 
plans to market a cigarette targeted at blacks reynolds 
subsequently dropped those plans but now intends to testmarket a 
cigarette called dakota news accounts have said the company was 
considering gearing the cigarette toward young women with a high 
school education or less 
sullivan has been concerned about minorities because they have 
higher rates of smoking than whites and have a higher rate of 
smokingrelated disease and death among high school seniors the 
smoking rate has leveled off at around 19 percent he said while 
lung cancer has surpassed the incidence of breast cancer among 
women

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan on 
tuesday expressed guarded optimism that the country can avoid a 
recession this year but his warnings on the dangers of 
accelerating inflation helped send financial markets into a 
tailspin 
setting up a potential clash with the administration greenspan 
said the central bank was looking for the economy to grow at a rate 
far below the one on which the administration based its 1991 budget 
wall street which has been battered this year by rising foreign 
interest rates took greenspans inflation warnings and growth 
forecast as further evidence that the central bank is intent on 
pursuing a tight money policy to battle inflation and thus will not 
move anytime soon to lower interest rates 
at midafternoon interest rates on longterm government bonds 
had jumped sharply while the prices which move in the opposite 
direction fell as much as 18 per 1000 in face value the dow 
jones industrial average of 30 stocks was down more than 38 points 
at the close of business 
were in an area where inflation is in danger of 
accelerating greenspan said in his appearance before a house 
banking subcommittee 
he called the performance of inflation so far this year 
horrendous although he said the januarys jump in prices was 
attributable in large part to temporary factors stemming from 
severe cold in december 
but he said that the risks of higher inflation in the present 
circumstances were larger than we should be willing to tolerate 
in the new fed economic forecast the central bank projected 
that the economy as measured by the gross national product will 
grow at an anemic rate of between 175 percent and 2 percent this 
year the slowest annual growth rate since the 198182 recession 
the bush administration in a forecast released last month with 
its 1991 budget request forecast growth almost a full percentage 
point higher at 26 percent when measured from the fourth quarter 
of 1989 
the administration also predicted that interest rates would drop 
sharply from their current levels a decline that would lower the 
governments borrowing costs on the 29 trillion national debt 
with the fed expected to keep interest rates high to restrain 
inflationary pressures economists said both the administrations 
growth and interest rate assumptions would prove to be too 
optimistic thus ballooning the federal budget deficit by billions 
of dollars 
the greenspan testimony is a clear indication of a toughened 
central bank stance against inflation said alan sinai chief 
economist of the boston co the message is that interest rates 
will stay high and perhaps go higher as the central bank keeps the 
economy throttled back to bring down inflation 
from june through december the central bank had been gradually 
easing shortterm interest rates out of concern that weakness in 
the economy might spell the end of the sevenyearold economic 
recovery the longest in peacetime history 
while economic growth did slow to a barely discernible 05 
percent annual rate from october through december the worst 
performance in 3 years greenspan in his testimony that he 
believed the danger point for an imminent recession had now passed 
he cited a variety of january statistics from rising auto sales 
to a surge in new home construction to bolster his belief that a 
modest rebound was occurring and that the weakest point may have 
passed 
while we cannot be certain that we are as yet out of the 
recessionary woods such evidence warrants at least guarded 
optimism he said 
the feds economic forecast for 1990 represented only a modest 
change from a preliminary estimate of 15 percent to 2 percent gnp 
growth made last june 
but the central bank did significantly alter its forecast on 
inflation predicting consumer prices would rise 4 percent to 45 
percent this year down from a june forecast of a 45 percent to 5 
percent increase 
analysts took this revision as another sign that the fed was 
toughening its inflationfighting resolve 
the ultimate objective of economic policy is to foster the 
maximum sustainable rate of economic growth greenspan said 
adding however that the economy might have to undergo subpar 
growth for a period of time in order to make sure inflation 
remained contained 
on other topics 
greenspan said that there was not at any time a desire on 
the part of federal officials to rescue drexel burnham lambert the 
large securities firm which got into financial difficulties because 
of its aggressive marketing of junk bonds 
he expressed his belief that the current turmoil in junk bonds 
would stabilize and that the sales of these highyield highrisk 
securities would continue although at a lower level 
the fed in its economic outlook said that the nearterm 
prospects for a moderation in labor cost pressures were not 
favorable and added that the recent declines in the value of the 
dollar would also worsen inflation by boosting the price of 
imported goods

with german reunification speeding western 
europes drive to create a 12nation single market by 1992 
president bushs trade policies were attacked sharply tuesday by 
both democrats and republicans in congress 
were going to be dealt out of the deal rep sam gejdenson 
dconn told top trade officials in the state and commerce 
departments and the white house office of the us trade 
representative 
rep toby roth rwis complained that bush is still living 
in the 1950s and 60s when we had free trade while the european 
community is about to join japan in erecting barriers to us 
exports through its ec 92 directives 
gejdenson chairman of the house foreign affairs committees 
trade subcommittee said adminstration officials assured him a year 
ago told that europe 92 is going to be the best thing since 
sliced bread 
but in the past nine months he said general electric and 
united technologies have decided to move some of their jet engine 
facilities to europe to assure continued market access there 
for the same reason several semiconductor manufacturers have 
reversed their initial plans to build new plants here and are 
instead going to put them in europe he said 
companies in this country have decided that youre not going 
to get the job done so theyre moving their investments to 
europe he asserted 
administration officials cited statistics at a hearing before 
gejdensons subcommittee showing that for the first time in five 
years the united states in 1989 enjoyed a trade surplus with 
europe a slight 17 billion 
while claiming success in knocking down proposed barriers for 
keeping us trucking companies and banks out of a unified european 
market they admitted losing key rounds on broadcasting and 
agriculture products 
we were not successful in the ec broadcast directive said 
peter allgeier the assistant us trade representative for europe 
but we have not left the playing field on that one let me assure 
you 
gejdenson complained that the administation hasnt even taken 
the field yet citing a congressional directive last may to augment 
the us delegation monitoring the negotiations in brussels with 
three career foreign service officers from the commerce department 
administration officials said two of those positions should be 
filled by this summer 
our single biggest trading partner is changing all the rules 
of the game and this is being treated as something we can get 
around to in the lazy days of summer gejdenson snapped 
it just boggles the mind he said this isnt a simply a 
debate about between liberalization and protectionism its about 
the survival of american manufacturing and european dominance over 
us economically 
assistant secretary of state eugene mcallister said moves in the 
past week toward reunifying east and west germany could very well 
help speed up the adoption of a singlemarket economy for all of 
western europe 
many of the ec nations are intent upon keeping germany 
westernoriented and they see ec 92 as a very important 
contributing factor to that he said

the bush administration under pressure to 
speed up its savings and loan cleanup said tuesday it will borrow 
11 billion by the end of march for its thrift bailout agency 
the new money should start flowing to the resolution trust corp 
by the end of this month said william taylor the chief staff 
officer of a treasuryled board overseeing the agency 
without the money the rtc would face a cash crunch that would 
virtually halt the disposal of failed thrifts after this week 
according to rtc spokesman stephen j katsanos 
bailout legislation enacted in august provides 50 billion 
through next year to cover the losses of failed thrifts but the 
trust corporation needs to borrow as much as an additional 100 
billion in working capital 
the 11 billion is the first leg of the borrowing which is to 
be repaid as the government sells loans real estate and other 
assets inherited from the failed thrifts 
the agency hasnt announced its borrowing plans for subsequent 
quarters but taylor said the amount in the apriljune period 
could be more than 11 billion 
tuesdays announcment follows a ruling last week by the justice 
department which found the rtc a government agency eligible to 
borrow through the treasury although the trust corporation is 
overseen by a treasuryled panel its work is performed by an 
independent banking agency the federal deposit insurance corp 
members of congress and private analysts have harshly criticized 
the arrangement as bureaucratic and prone to delays however the 
establishment of the new borrowing plan likely will shift the brunt 
of pressure from the administrations oversight board to the fdic 
were going to try to stay out of their way as much as 
possible taylor told reporters 
federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan a member of the 
oversight panel told a house banking subcommittee tuesday he 
expected a significant acceleration of activity 
at the end of last week the rtc had disposed of only 49 of the 
368 failed thrifts it has seized the agency has made little 
headway in selling the 180 billion in assets owned by the sampls 
it is projecting an increase in resolutions to 50 institutions 
per quarter approximately double the pace of its first six months 
of operation

a pentagon report released tuesday said that 
the air force colonel who resigned last week as editor of the 
pacific stars and stripes newspaper violated military regulations 
by manipulating the papers news content 
col edwin j montgomery resigned friday citing the report by 
ombudsman philip foisie 
foisie was hired by the defense department last year to assess 
the free flow of information to the military readership of the 
toykobased pacific stars and stripes and its european sister 
publication based near frankfurt west germany 
montgomery had said he was disappointed that foisie viewed his 
editing practices as news management but was pleased he had not 
been accused of censorship 
in his report foisie said that the editing process at pacific 
stars and stripes under montgomery was seriously flawed but 
that there was no censorship in the sense of readers being 
systematically deprived of any specific type of news 
in my professional judgment col montgomery has too often 
infringed on the common practice of good journalism foisie 
wrote if censorship is the wrong word news management is 
probably the right description of these infringements and it is 
expressly prohibited in the military regulations 
civilian journalists at pacific stars and stripes have publicly 
complained of censorship by military editors news management and 
harassment of journalists who raise objections 
foisie said montgomery who assumed the role of commander and 
editorinchief of the newspaper in 1986 was seriously miscast 
due to a lack of journalistic experience and had failed to delegate 
many editing duties 
foise credited montgomery with improving the newspapers 
financial position and said some of montgomerys critics on the 
paper had exaggerated the news management problem by claiming 
he frequently killed stories unfavorable to the military 
but foisie said montgomery was preoccupied with the details of 
editorial content and had introduced what many staff journalists 
consider an ideological element in deciding which stories were 
printed and how they were displayed in the paper 
this foisie wrote has had a chilling effect on the staff 
and has induced a degree of selfcensorship 
foisie said the tokyo newsroom had fallen into disarray and was 
plagued by very low morale an incipient staff revolt and one 
might say a staff conspiracy 
reiterating a recommendation he made in a preliminary report 
last month foisie said the newspaper should put a civilian in the 
post of top news executive that would make the paper less 
vulnerable to charges that the military censors it he said 
the stars and stripes papers are authorized but unofficial 
publications the pentagon says their charter says they are to 
provide a free flow of news and information without 
censorship or news management

prospects for farm income continue bright 
although there is some slippage from the record level of two years 
ago an agriculture department report said tuesday 
net cash income may be in the range of 52 billion to 57 
billion compared with an estimated 53 billion in 1989 and the 
record of 572 billion in 1988 
that is the money left for farmers after deducting cash expenses 
from gross cash income in a calendar year it can include proceeds 
from sales of commodities held over from previous years 
net farm income another method of bookkeeping may be in the 
range of 44 billion to 49 billion this year compared with 48 
billion in 1989 and 427 billion in 1988 
this method measures income from farming during a specific year 
including changes in the value of inventories allowances for 
family dwellings and depreciation 
figures for both accounting methods were unchanged from 
projections made by the departments economic research service the 
last two months 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter noted in testimony before 
the house agriculture committee earlier tuesday that virtually 
all indicators of farm sector wellbeing have improved the last 
few years 
farm income is up farm failures are down farmland values are 
recovering and debttoasset ratios have improved yeutter said 
commodity surpluses have all but disappeared some idle land has 
returned to production and farm program spending is down 
the agency report said farmland values have been revised based 
on the 1987 census of agriculture the average us price of 
farmland as of february 1989 for example was revised upward to 
667 per acre from the earlier estimate of 597 no state figures 
were included

black leaders have renewed demands for new 
charges against a former fertilizer salesman who was tried and 
freed in the slaying of civil rights activist medgar evers 26 years 
ago 
the rev ld bass a longtime civil rights leader in jackson 
contended monday at a rally that prosecutors are not adequately 
pursuing a new trial against byron de la beckwith 
were not going to rest until byron de la beckwith is brought 
to justice in mississippi bass told about a dozen people 
gathered for the protest in front of the hinds county courthouse 
murder charges against beckwith a white supremacist were 
dropped after two allwhite hinds county juries were unable to 
reach verdicts in 1964 
prosecutors said monday they are continuing to determine whether 
sufficient evidence exists to reopen the case 
evers 37 who was a field secretary for the mississippi naacp 
was killed june 12 1963 by a bullet in the back as he emerged 
from his car at his jackson home 
beckwiths rifle bearing one of his fingerprints was found 
near evers home beckwith contended the rifle had been stolen from 
him 
the rifle and all other evidence from the two trials disappeared 
several months ago presumably from the hinds county circuit 
clerks office where such documents and property were supposed to 
be kept 
we are just as interested as anyone else in bringing the 
killer of medgar evers to justice but it takes evidence to do 
that right now we just dont have that evidence assistant 
district attorney bobby delaughter said monday 
beckwith 69 lives in signal mountain tenn 
last year the national association for the advancement of 
colored people and jackson city council asked for the case to be 
reopened after reports that the states old segregation spy agency 
the sovereignty commission screened potential jurors before 
beckwiths second trial 
prosecutors investigated and said they found no evidence of jury 
tampering 
the local offices of the fbi state department of archives and 
history and the jackson police department failed to turn up the 
missing evidence delaughter said 
a search also was made of the fbis washington office but 
delaughter had no word on the results 
they have swept it the case under the rug and theyre not 
even moving at a snails pace bass said we want the district 
attorney to come forward and bring this case to justice 
aaron henry president of the state naacp who also attended the 
rally questioned the sincerity of the hunt for the missing 
evidence 
keep on looking because whenever we dont want to do 
something we find reasons not to do it he said 
beckwith said by telephone monday that he might return to 
mississippi some day to seek political office he ran 
unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in mississippi in 1967 
if things get much worse in mississippi i plan to run for 
lieutenant governor so that people will know men and women of white 
christian lineage will not put up with this deviltry beckwith 
said

social security commissioner gwendolyn king on 
tuesday defended the agencys nationwide tollfree telephone 
network as a success story but acknowledged that callers too 
often get busy signals 
mrs king said the agency was preparing television and newspaper 
public service announcements encouraging people to have breakfast 
with social security by calling between 7 and 9 am when lines 
are less busy 
the telephone network which went nationwide in october was 
expected to handle about 250000 calls a day but more than 15 
million people try to get through on peak days and many call 
between 10 am and 2 pm she said 
the 800 number is the biggest success story weve had mrs 
king said at a media briefing we just have too a big a success 
on our hands the trick is how to manage it so that it works 
better 
the telephone network reached by dialing 18002345ssa is 
staffed from 7 am to 7 pm local time across the country and 
allows callers to take care of many matters without going into a 
social security office 
however congressional critics have complained that people often 
are unable to get through on the tollfree lines and that many 
dont get full and accurate information when they do get through a 
house ways and means subcommittee was scheduled to hold a hearing 
wednesday on the network 
mrs king said a study by the inspector generals office of the 
department of health and human services found that 67 percent of 
those who used the tollfree line said they would use the telephone 
again to do business with social security up from 53 percent in 
1984 
eightytwo percent of those who contacted social security using 
the 800 number reported the service was good or very good she said 
what we are finding is that when people do get through they 
find the service is courteous theyre very happy with the 
information they received she said 
in january traditionally a busy month for the agency an 
estimated 52 percent of calls to the tollfree number were met with 
busy signals compared with 14 percent in december 51 percent in 
november and 30 percent in october mrs king said her goal is to 
reduce the busy rate on peak days to 35 percent by the end of the 
year 
mrs king also announced three steps to improve morale and 
service at the social security administration where many workers 
have complained that they are overworked and unable to provide good 
service because of huge staff cuts during the reagan administration 
mrs king said she is 
dispatching four strike teams to visit field offices 
throughout the country and approve additional employees and 
equipment where needs are the greatest about 400 employees could 
be added she said 
suspending all numerical performance goals such as handling a 
certain number of cases per day or per month mrs king said the 
agency would come up with a new set of goals to better measure 
workloads and performance 
naming bill rogers a former social security employee from the 
seattle area as ombudsman to hear complaints and ideas from social 
security managers and employees

the senate on tuesday unanimously ratified an 
international labor organization convention agreement aimed at 
improving the collection and reporting of labor statistics around 
the world 
the ilo convention on labor statistics was approved 940 nearly 
five years after it was approved by the unaffiliated labor 
organization in geneva switzerland 
president reagan transmitted the treaty to the senate on jan 3 
1989 less than three weeks before he left office reagan 
recommended its ratification at the time as did secretary of state 
george p shultz and labor secretary ann mclaughlin 
the reagan cabinet officers noted that the united states already 
was collecting and reporting basic labor force employment and 
economic statistics of the kind the ilo was seeking in its 
convention on statistics but these officials said that since the 
united states could readily abide by the terms of the treaty there 
was no reason not to ratify it 
sen daniel patrick moynihan dny told colleagues tuesday 
that the labor statistics treaty afforded the senate a good 
opportunity to go on record in supporting the work of the ilo

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
tuesday the most critical challenge facing the united states in 
combatting illegal drug use is the problem of domestic consumption 
rather blocking supplies from abroad 
as long as the demand for drugs by americans remains 
voracious our nation faces an endless uphill struggle to halt 
supply baker said 
his remarks were prepared for delivery in new york at the un 
special session on narcotics a text of his remarks was released by 
the state department 
baker expressed hope that a unled effort to act against drug 
smuggling will help the world come closer to ending the drug 
scourge 
he added that to be successful any such program must entail 
concrete commitments and be fully implemented by un agencies 
certainly we the member governments cannot ask the united 
nations to do things that we will not do at home he said 
bakers appearance at the un session just five days after the 
drug summit in colombia was aimed at reinforcing the high priority 
the bush administration is attaching to the drug issue 
he said the domestic antidrug budget has increased to 76 
billion a 67 percent increase while internationally the increase 
has been 73 percent to 31 billion 
we fully realize that attacking the problem of domestic 
consumption is our most critical challenge baker said 
indicating he is sympathetic to latin appeals that the 
administration shift its emphasis to combatting drug abuse on the 
home front instead of the supply source 
he added however that us drugcontrol strategy calls for an 
attack on the drug problem in all its aspects consumption

house speaker thomas s foley offered praise 
on tuesday to a proposal to allow people to partially offset the 
costs of the social security payroll tax by taking a credit on 
their income tax returns 
the plan is one of several options under study by a task force 
of top house and senate democrats weighing what to do about the 
vast surpluses accumulated each year by the social security trust 
funds the issue has attracted attention in recent weeks after sen 
daniel patrick moynihan dny proposed reducing the surpluses by 
cutting the payroll tax 
the democratic leaders are considering a list of proposals 
compiled by aides the lawmakers are expected to recommend a course 
of action as early as this week 
foley dwash called the income tax credit idea a very 
interesting proposal in his daily briefing with reporters but 
provided no details 
it would i think tend to restore some progressivity to the tax 
system and it has other features i think are worthy of very 
serious consideration foley said 
workers pay a 765 percent social security payroll tax an 
amount that is in addition to their income tax employers must also 
pay the government an equal amount on behalf of each employee 
critics have charged that the payroll tax discriminates against 
low and middleincome workers because it is levied only on the 
first 51300 of annual earnings people pay no payroll tax on 
their wages above that amount and pay no payroll tax at all on 
income from interest dividends rents and other nonwage earnings 
sources speaking on condition they not be identified said there 
are several formulations of the incometax credit plan no final 
decisions have been made on the credits amount who would qualify 
or when it would begin 
what it would accomplish supporters say is sidestep the 
criticism the bush administration and other republicans have 
leveled at moynihans proposed tax cut that it tinkers with social 
security a highly sensitive political issue for congress white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater has said moynihans idea will 
eventually lead to offsetting tax increases or cuts in social 
security benefits 
its one great source of appeal obviously is you dont have to 
do anything about the social security trust fund said one source 
moynihans plan would cut the governments payroll tax 
collections by 62 billion over the next two years a sizable 
addition to what is already an expected 138 billion budget deficit 
for this year it has been criticized by senate finance committee 
chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas house ways and means committee 
chairman dan rostenkowski dill the american association of 
retired persons and the national association of manufacturers 
but the plan is believed to have the support of many members of 
congress because it would cut taxes 
senate budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn said 
tuesday that there is a large fluid body of senators undecided 
about moynihans bill and predicted there could be a stampede if 
favor of the moynihan proposal should there be a vote on it 
the social security task force consists of bentsen 
rostenkowski sasser senate majority leader richard gephardt 
dmo and house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif 
this year the social security trust fund is expected to have a 
66 billion surplus moynihan and others say those collections make 
the federal deficit appear smaller that it really is

the united states on tuesday defended 
construction of a 300 million shortwave relay station in israel 
with one official saying tremendous attention was given to 
ensure the project doesnt hurt the environment 
malcolm forbes jr chairman of the board of international 
broadcasting told the house foreign affairs committee that more 
than 2 million had been spent on environmental studies 
please know that the bib shares these concerns and has given 
them tremendous attention throughout the design phase of the 
project forbes said there have been no significant findings 
whatsoever that this station will have a detrimental effect on the 
environment in the negev 
environmentalists have raised concerns that the project in the 
negev desert 30 miles south of the dead sea near the border of 
jordan could damage the ecology particularly the path of migrating 
birds 
the project conceived three years ago will consist of 16 
500kilowatt transmitters and 37 curtain antennas the transmitters 
will be used by the voice of america and radio free europeradio 
liberty governmentfunded stations 
the board of international broadcasting is the parent of radio 
free europeradio liberty 
the transmitters will give the stations added power to reach 
asian regions of the soviet union as well as listeners in africa 
india and pakistan 
despite forbes assurances environmentalists and rep james 
scheuer dny continued to oppose the project 
its quite time for the project to be reappraised scheuer 
said adding it would be more suitable to put the station in asia 
scheuer also argued that events in eastern europe where 
democracy is emerging have lessened the need for the station in 
israel us officials disagreed 
the situation in yugoslavia and bulgaria both intended 
audiences for this relay station remains fragile the bib said 
in a statement 
brent blackwelder vice president of friends of the earth an 
environmental group said the project should be rescinded and the 
money channeled elsewhere 
because the station is a complex project of towers cables and 
guy wires it will present a major visual impact in this desert 
area and will have the potential to impact in this desert and will 
have the potential to impact the very significant bird flyway 
connecting africa to europe and asia blackwelder said

she said 
the case grew out of wilsons decision in 1984 to loan willard 
stuart the money to buy a car despite his poor driving record and 
lack of a drivers license 
shortly after that stuart drove the car off a bridge after 
drinking beer and whiskey and smoking marijuana with a group of 
young men one of his companions mark vince was in the back seat 
during the accident and was seriously injured he later had one leg 
amputated 
vince sued wilson a 1987 jury found her liable and ordered her 
to pay vince 950000 which amount to all of her assets 
while refusing to reverse the 1987 decision on appeal the 
vermont supreme court later ruled that a jury should decide if ace 
auto of bennington and its president and salesman in the deal gary 
gardner should share the liability for selling the car to stuart 
in opening arguments at the trial tuesday morning wilsons 
lawyer frederick harlow told jurors that vince not wilson must 
bear the blame for the fact he is mostly paralyzed and has lost a 
leg 
that theme was echoed by j fred carbine the lawyer for the car 
dealership that sold stuart the car 
i say use your common sense he told jurors this was a 
bad day for mark vince a day that ruined his life but we didnt 
do it

the supreme court ruled tuesday that parents 
suspected of child abuse sometimes may be jailed indefinitely for 
refusing to disclose the whereabouts of their children 
voting 72 the justices permitted the indefinite jailing of a 
maryland woman for refusing to tell authorities where her young son 
can be found th boy is feared dead 
societys interest in protecting the boy from harm prevails over 
the mothers claim that her right against selfincrimination will 
be violated if she is forced to reveal the childs location the 
court said 
although narrowly written the ruling could provide a new weapon 
for officials seeking to protect children from parental abuse 
in other action the court 
made it easier for disabled children to win some federal 
welfare benefits the 72 decision in a pennsylvania case could 
force the government to reevaluate benefits for some 250000 
children 
agreed to use an ohio case to decide whether prosecutors who 
exclude blacks as jurors because of their race violate the rights 
of white defendants 
left intact baltimore md ordinances requiring the citys 
employee pension plans to divest themselves of all investments in 
companies doing business with south africa 
rejected an appeal by nevada officials letting the federal 
government withhold highway money from states that do not comply 
with a national speed limit 
refused to revive a lawsuit against the federal government and 
a nasa engineer by the widow of one of the astronauts who died when 
the space shuttle challenger exploded in 1986 
in a case involving the private papers of church of scientology 
founder l ron hubbard left intact a ruling that limits 
dramatically the right of authors to quote unpublished material 
rejected an appeal by colorado officials seeking proceeds of 
drug transactions that were forfeited to the federal government 
in the case of the jailed maryland mother jacqueline bouknight 
has been behind bars since april 1988 for refusing to disclose the 
whereabouts of her son maurice the boy has been missing since 
september 1987 when he was 11 months old 
maurice was admitted to a baltimore hospital in early 1987 when 
he was 3 months old for treatment of a broken leg and other 
injuries he temporarily was held in protective care 
maurice was returned to his mothers custody after she agreed 
not to punish him physically and to undergo training in parenting 
skills 
nine months later social workers said ms bouknight no longer 
was cooperating with them the mother was held in contempt by a 
judge after she refused to disclose maurices whereabouts 
the maryland court of appeals the states highest court ruled 
that jailing ms bouknight for refusing to disclose the information 
violates her constitutional protection against selfincrimination 
that ruling was overturned tuesday 
justice sandra day oconnor wrote for the court that ms 
bouknights claim that her constitutional rights are being violated 
is particularly weak because of her agreement with welfare 
officials 
moreover oconnor said in most missingchildren cases 
officials are trying to help the children and not prosecute parents 
concern for the childs safety oconnor said underlay 
the efforts to gain access to and then compel production of 
bouknights son 
the government demands production of the very public charge 
entrusted to a custodian and makes the demand for compelling 
reasons unrelated to criminal law enforcement and as part of a 
broadly applied regulatory regime she said in these 
circumstances bouknight cannot invoke the privilege against 
selfincrimination to resist the order to produce maurice 
oconnor noted that the mother never said she was unable to 
produce the child because she did not know where he is 
oconnor also hinted that prosecutors might be barred from using 
any testimony bouknight gives in producing the child 
but justice thurgood marshall in a dissenting opinion said 
that is little comfort now for the mother 
accusing the court of riding roughshod over individual 
rights marshall said i am not content to deny bouknight the 
constitutional protection required now in the hope that she 
will not be convicted later on the basis of her own testimony 
marshall was joined in dissent by justice william j brennan 
benna ruth solomon chief counsel for the state and local legal 
center said the decision gives significant help to welfare 
officials 
were happy to have won this case she said i suppose it 
would have been more helpful to childprotection people in the 
field to have gotten more guidance but i see no reason to be 
pessimistic 
some have compared the bouknight case to that of dr elizabeth 
morgan of washington dc released from jail last september after 
more than two years behind bars for refusing to let her daughter 
visit the girls father morgans former husband 
morgan went to jail rather than produce the girl for 
courtordered visits with the father morgan accused her former 
husband of sexually abusing the child charges he repeatedly has 
denied 
the right against selfincrimination was not an issue in that 
case so the bouknight ruling appears to have no bearing on it

foreign minister moshe arens will meet with 
us secretary of state james a baker iii this week to discuss the 
stalled middle east peace process the foreign ministry announced 
tuesday 
a potentially damaging split meanwhile emerged in prime 
minister yitzhak shamirs likud bloc following the resignation of 
the hardline trade minister ariel sharon 
a foreign ministry statement said arens will stop in washington 
for two days following a visit to mexico and will meet baker friday 
the visit is in the framework of continuing contacts to 
advance the peace process the statement said it gave no further 
details 
baker has proposed a threeway meeting with the foreign 
ministers of egypt and israel to discuss the peace process and 
resolve differences over the composition of a palestinian 
delegation for proposed israelipalestinian talks 
the threeway meeting would be aimed at reviving an israeli 
proposal for elections in the occupied west bank and gaza strip as 
a first step toward peace 
the israeli plan offers limited autonomy to the 17 million 
palestinian residents of the territories captured by israel from 
jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war but it stops short of 
meeting palestinian demands for an independent state and for talks 
with the plo israel considers the plo to be a terrorist 
organization 
prime minister yitzhak shamir has been under fire by rebel 
ministers within his own party who fear the ussponsored talks 
could provide a backdoor entry for the plo and could lead to an 
israeli surrender of occupied lands including arab east jerusalem 
last week hardline trade minister ariel sharon announced he 
was resigning from the cabinet and challenged shamirs leadership 
of likud the resignation was effective tuesday 
also tuesday five of sharons allies threatened to pull out of 
likud which would make the rival labor party the largest in 
parliament however it was not clear if the rebels threat was 
serious or they were only playing for more power within likud 
sharon told reporters he had not sanctioned the split but 
added all these things to my regret are because of one thing 
an absence of leadership in likud 
in a surprising display of strength shamir appointed three of 
his allies to replace sharon at the trade ministry and on the 
decisionmaking inner cabinet and to fill a vacancy in the full 
cabinet 
he appointed moshe nissim a member of the former liberal party 
as trade minister he also appointed longtime ally moshe katzav to 
sharons position in the 12member inner cabinet and legislator 
david magen to the cabinet 
the appointments must now be approved by parliament where they 
are expected to face little opposition israel radio said 
the rebel legislators headed by economic affairs minister 
yitzhak modai submitted a letter on monday to parliament 
demanding recognition as an independent faction 
their letter made public by newspapers tuesday said the group 
would cease to be part of the likud faction in parliament if 
the knesset house committee granted their request 
a decision on whether to recognize the separate faction was 
expected next monday israel radio said 
such a move would reduce likud to 35 seats in the 120member 
knesset or parliament compared to 39 for the centerleft labor 
party the five rebels all are members of the liberal party which 
earlier merged with likud 
one of the rebels legislator pinchas goldstein noted on israel 
radio that the break with likud was not final but refused to 
specify what their demands were 
the radio said a likud split could convince labor to leave the 
coalition cabinet and try to form its own government with small 
parties should likudlabor disagreements on the peace process come 
to a head 
labor favors accepting the usproposed compromises to revive 
israels stalled plan for holding palestinian elections shamir has 
publicly opposed most of the suggested compromises

in an effort to save africa and europe from a 
pest that once plagued the western hemisphere the house 
agriculture committee on tuesday approved a bill allowing sale of 
sterile screwworms to other countries 
sterile screwworm flies mate with fertile screwworm flies but 
produce no offspring causing the population to eventually 
disappear 
through intensive efforts the pest was declared eradicated in 
the united states in 1982 the government has spent millions of 
dollars to kill it off in mexico and central america so it doesnt 
return to the united states 
the discovery of the pest in north africa causes deep concern 
because it potentially could spread to the middle east and southern 
european nations bordering the mediterranean sea said rep kika 
de la garza chairman of the agriculture committee 
the screwworm fly is a flesheating parasite that attacks all 
warmblooded animals even humans and is a serious threat to 
livestock 
de la garza said that in countries such as those in north 
africa where drought and famine have weakened human health people 
are abnormally vulnerable to the insect 
this could lead to the need for additional requests for food 
aid and public health assistance in a region already burdened with 
over 140 billion in external foreign debt he said 
he said that shortly after the screwworm was discovered in 
africa the un food and agricultural organization asked the joint 
usmexico screwworm commission to help 
the only facility mass producing sterile screwworms has been 
operated since 1976 by the commission in tuxtla gutierrez mexico 
the usda agriculture department reports that it is possible 
the screwworm could become the most devastating livestock and 
wildlife pest on the african continent said de la garza this 
bill would provide the necessary authority for the usda or the usda 
working through the commission to sell sterile flies to the food 
and agricultural organization 
the legislation is not controversial and is supported by the 
bush administration though the senate has not yet acted speedy 
movement through congress is anticipated

school 
over 750000 american students will drop out of school this 
year said sen edward m kennedy dmass chairman of the labor 
and human resources committee 
they will have many reasons for doing so including poor 
teachers broken homes devastated communities poverty drug use 
and the need to go to work whatever the cause their decision is a 
tragedy for them and the nation

a network of international agreements has 
eliminated cause to be scared to death of a reunited germany 
austrian chancellor franz vranitzky said tuesday 
vranitzky who spoke at the national press club also met with 
president bush at the white house where they discussed changes in 
eastern europe 
it must be a universal delight in terms of those changes in 
your neighboring countries bush told him 
absolutely right said vranitzky 
a good deal of people have second thoughts or apprehension 
when they hear about a united germany vranitzky told the press 
club recalling how germany wielded its power earlier in this 
century 
but he said european democracy has developed to the point 
where large countries dont exert pressure on smaller ones 
vranitzky said he sees no prospect for a repeat of 1933 when adolf 
hitler came to power in germany or 1938 when germany annexed 
austria and part of czechoslovakia 
secondly europe today is characterized by a broad network of 
international agreements a very wellknit network for 
international cooperation and for stability and security 
vranitzky said 
so i do really not think that as somebody said we should be 
scared to death by german unity he added 
vranitzky asked whether many austrians favored a closer 
political and economic union with germany said no the answer 
is no clear no definite no 
vranitzky whose country decided to become permanently neutral 
when the victors of world war ii ended their occupation in 1955 
was asked whether he thought a united germany should be neutral 
i do not think that it is realistic to believe that germany 
will become a neutral country within any foreseeable future said 
vranitzky

political reform in the soviet union and 
eastern europe has made the soviet kgb spy agency less 
confrontational but the threat from foreign spies will decline only 
modestly for now the head of the cia said tuesday evening 
i think the kgb has become less confrontational in the sense 
that they avoid doing blatant or flatfooted things that would 
create a major press issue the cia director william webster 
said in remarks prepared for delivery to the baltimore council on 
foreign affairs but the activity is there and it will continue 
the agency released a text of his remarks in washington 
within the soviet union however there does seem to be a 
movement toward relaxing kgb repression of soviet dissidents 
webster said noting a similar withering of internal secret police 
activity among the kgbs allied spy agencies in eastern europe 
webster predicted the eastern european agencies would reduce 
their cooperation with moscow but that no major reduction in their 
effort to gain us secrets would occur so long as the warsaw pact 
remains in place 
he also said that as economic competition replaces political 
and military tension between east and west attempts to acquire 
sensitive technology by all nations is increasing and becoming 
more sophisticated 
webster presented a complicated picture in eastern europe where 
spy agencies have operated since world war ii as proxies for the 
kgb 
their subservience to the kgb and gru soviet military 
intelligence is due for careful review he said 
he noted that the hungarian foreign ministry publicly 
disassociated itself recently from the alleged spying efforts of 
us army sgt clyde lee conrad arrested in west germany in 1988 
on charges of spying for a hungarian intelligence officer 
the foreign ministry declared it an erroneous policy pursued 
by the previous leadership without regard to the countrys national 
interests webster said 
but the intelligence chief cautioned that espionage and 
counterintelligence are widely recognized in eastern europe as 
necessary functions and the apparatus for this work is likely to 
remain in place the work will continue 
the warsaw pact he said requires that east european 
intelligence services cooperate with the soviet union so i dont 
expect military intelligence collection efforts to abate 
certainly not in the near future 
overall he said his agency hopes that new political leadership 
in eastern europe will reduce some hostile intelligence activity 
such as passing sensitive technology to the soviets an activity 
which is incompatible with requests for us loans but fundamental 
changes in intelligence missions are not likely while the warsaw 
pact treaty connections are still in place 
in addition he said the current spy managers in east europe 
were picked from the old communist loyalists and trained in the 
soviet union and may be difficult to replace 
webster said all the changes would ultimately depend on the 
success of soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs efforts to put the 
soviet union on the road to a more democratic government 
but the new system he is trying to create is not yet ready to 
take the place of the old one he is discarding webster added 
economic conditions have deteriorated crime is increasing 
ethnic turmoil is escalating 
whether gorbachevs responses will satisfy the soviet people 
quite frankly we dont know and neither do they 
he also outlined two separate rates of political change in east 
europe 
profound transformation is going on in hungary 
czechoslovakia east germany and poland where communist parties 
are in full retreat webster said but in the balkans the 
process of transformation is more complicated 
political opposition is not welldeveloped in many of these 
countries in bulgaria for example communists stand a good chance 
of playing a major role in the government after elections in may 
and in romania some particularly the intellectuals and students 
are concerned that the national salvation front will simply replace 
the communist party and not offer the hopedfor change 
he also cited ethnic strife in romania and yugoslavia as an 
obstacle to reform

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev said a united 
germany must respect europes current borders and only the four 
victorious allies of world war ii can determine germanys final 
status tass reported tuesday 
gorbachev addressed the issue of german unity in an interview 
with pravda carried by tass before it appeared wednesday in the 
communist party newspaper 
progress toward reunificaion has accelerated in recent weeks 
premier hans modrow of east germany plagued by mass emigration and 
a crumbling economy asked on tuesday for immediate reunification 
talks under a formula worked out with the allies 
modrow and chancellor helmut kohl of west germany both visited 
moscow this month to discuss unification with gorbachev the soviet 
president 
kohl said he had gorbachevs assurance the soviet union would 
respect the desire of germans to have one nation 
in the pravda interview gorbachev said germans should decide 
the form and schedule of reunification but emphasized that germany 
unity also concerns others and any encroachment upon the borders 
of other states must be ruled out 
he specifically mentioned polands western border kohls 
failure to make a public pledge to respect that border prompted 
poland to request a roll in talks on reunification between the two 
germanys and the allies 
both germanys are bound by treaties to respect the frontier but 
a united country would not be and some conservatives in west 
germany have suggested reunification be sought within the 1937 
borders in 1937 onethird of what is now poland was german 
territory 
gorbachev spoke in the interview of the rights of nations to 
protect their interests and said i refer primarily to poland 
the inviolability of its postwar borders like the borders of other 
states must be guaranteed only an international legal act can 
provide such a guarantee 
about a united germanys relationship with nato and the warsaw 
pact he said the alliances retain a role as a new european 
security system evolves and any disruption of the 
militarystrategic balance is unacceptable 
east germany is moscows most important military ally and about 
twothirds of the 575000 soviet troops in eastern europe are 
stationed there 
emergence of a reunited germany as a powerful economic and 
military force in central europe has aroused concern and gorbachev 
said in the interview 
no one has a right to ignore the negative potential formed in 
germanys past especially as it is impossible to fail to consider 
peoples memory of war of its horrors and losses therefore it is 
very important that germans deciding the question of unification 
should be aware of their responsibility 
this applies particularly to our country to the soviet 
people it has an inalienable right to expect and the possibility 
to exert efforts to ensure that our country should not sustain 
either moral or political or economic damage from german 
unification

a palestinian human rights group charged 
tuesday that israeli soldiers were carrying out deliberate 
coldblooded killings of palestinian suspects instead of 
arresting them 
officials of al haqlaw in the service of man told a news 
conference that its researchers documented three such cases and 
were investigating 15 possible other such killings in the past year 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
an israeli military spokesman denied israel had any policy of 
deliberate killings and the army issued a fivesentence statement 
saying it categorically rejects the baseless and unfounded 
accusations detailed in the 692page report 
the report cited several changes in israeli policy in the past 
year that have been acknowledged by the government but which al haq 
and other human rights organizations see as violations of 
international law 
among these were 
increasing the initial time a suspect in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip can be held without charges or trial under 
administrative detention from six months to one year 
allowing soldiers to open fire at masked palestinian suspects 
even if they are unarmed when the suspects ignore orders to halt 
the army has said soldiers first must fire warning shots in the air 
and then shoot at the suspects legs al haq noted that 17 of the 
31 palestinians killed by soldiers in october were masked men 
sealing houses of people suspected of throwing stones 
previously sealings and demolition of houses were used for those 
suspected of firebombings or other more serious attacks 
the us state department and amnesty international have 
complained about administrative detentions and house demolitions as 
violations of international law 
fatah azzam administrative director of al haq said not enough 
international pressure had been put on israel and the report 
itself complained of unwillingness by israeli authorities to 
respond to criticism 
while the use of illegal measures to suppress the uprising has 
been intensified attention has been deflected through the 
periodic issuance of new regulations and policy statements intended 
to reassure the international community it said 
as to the charges of deliberate killings al haq said all three 
of the victims were shot at close range and that in two cases they 
were denied needed medical attention 
yaser abu ghosh 17 was shot by a soldier who took careful aim 
and fired from a distance of seven yards as the teenager was being 
chased july 10 in ramallah the report said it said the victim 
apparently received no medical treatment for more than two hours 
nidal alhabash 21 was shot as he raised his hands to 
surrender after being surrounded following a chase by soldiers in 
the west bank city of nablus on oct 9 al haq said 
atwa harzallah 27 was stopped with four other palestinians on 
feb 27 1989 in the west bank village of deir ibzi and while all 
five raised their hands soldiers shot harzallah twice in the head 
the report said it said two of those with harzallah were later 
arrested 
the al haq report noted the army had maintained that proper 
procedures were followed in the shooting of abu ghosh including 
shouted warnings and first shooting at the suspects legs but 
added that eyewitness accounts contradicted this version 
it also noted that authorities claimed harzallah was killed 
during a stonethrowing incident it said a lawyer for his family 
requested an investigation in april but has not yet received a 
response 
on tuesday an army spokesman said he was checking the status of 
the three cases but he denied any policy of deliberate killings 
we totally and completely deny any policy which calls upon 
soldiers to premeditatedly kill palestinians he said 
the army statement said al haq is known as an organization 
made up entirely of palestinians and their supporters it is no 
surprise that the report it has presented is oneside and 
negative 
al haq which is affiliated with the international commission of 
jurists in geneva switzerland listed 379 killings of palestinians 
by soldiers israeli settlers and collaborators with israel during 
the year 
it did not give an accounting of killings of alleged 
collaborators by other palestinians and despite repeated questions 
at the news conference its officials refused to criticize directly 
the palestinian groups who may have carried out the killings 
mona rishlawi an attorney for al haq said the organization had 
no way of investigating underground killings and had to hold 
israel responsible as the occupation authority 
as long as the de facto authority is in the hands of the 
israeli military it is they who are responsible she said 
according to statistics kept by the associated press 658 
palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers or civilians 
since the uprising began 26 months ago at least 187 palestinians 
have been killed by fellow arabs most on suspicion of 
collaboration fortythree israelis have died 
in the latest casualty a 14yearold palestinian youth died 
tuesday in tel aviv of a gunshot wound suffered sunday in a clash 
with troops soldiers also shot and wounded five arabs in the 
occupied gaza strip arab hospital officials said

health secretary louis sullivan continued his 
campaign against tobacco companies tuesday and issued a report 
showing that smoking costs the country more than 52 billion 
annually in health care costs and lost productivity 
sullivan condemned tobacco company advertising practices that 
target women minorities and young people saying they must stop 
their irresponsibility 
in testimony before the senate labor and human resources 
committee he also called on advertising agencies to join 
antismoking efforts by renouncing tobacco ads and said television 
stations should donate free air time to help educate viewers about 
the dangers of smoking 
sullivan also said that while the bush administration supports 
the intent of legislation to increase regulation of tobacco 
products and educate about the risks of smoking it believes the 
bill which would cost an estimated 185 million is unnecessary 
the tobacco product education and health protection act of 1990 
would establish a center as part of the federal centers for disease 
control to expand education efforts on smoking conduct 
smokingrelated research and regulate tobacco products much as the 
food and drug administration regulates food products 
the center also would administer a paid advertising program to 
discourage smoking and provide incentive grants to states to 
encourage enactment and better enforcement of laws prohibiting the 
sale of tobacco to minors 
sullivan said his department yearly spends about 79 million on 
antismoking programs many of which duplicate the efforts proposed 
in the legislaton 
he said free public service announcements about the risks of 
smoking are preferable to governmentpaid ads in light of other 
demands on the federal budget he also said that regulating the 
additives in cigarettes envisioned in the bill would send the 
wrong message 
were concerned that this would suggest that we believe that 
under certain conditions with certain monitoring that tobacco is 
safe he said we would rather see our efforts on reducing and 
elmiminating by the year 2000 all tobacco from our society 
however sen edward kennedy dmass and chairman of the senate 
committee noted that bottled perrier water was pulled from the 
market when it was found to contain benzene at levels up to four 
times what is allowed under federal standards while a surgeon 
generals report estimated the benzene content of cigarettes is 
2000 times higher than that 
the consumer has a right to know the key ingredients and 
additives to a pack of cigarettes when they purchase the product 
kennedy said 
sullivan agreed that consumers should have such information 
charles o whitley representing the tobacco institute noted in 
testimony submitted to the committee that congress previously 
considered and rejected disclosure of ingredient information 
because it contains trade secrets this information is supplied to 
the health and human services secretary but it does not identify 
the company or brand of cigarettes 
whitley also said other provisions in the bill arent needed 
because young people are already aware of the risks of smoking he 
also denied that the industry targets young people in advertising 
campaigns to encourage themhabit 
he also defended the industry against critics who say that 
tobacco companies target women and minorities saying the industry 
is not trying to encourage people to start smoking but rather hopes to 
take up the 
to retain or gain market share from competitors 
sullivan released a report on the economic consequences of 
smoking that estimated smokingrelated disease costs each american 
221 a year largely in healthcare and insurance costs 
he said the costs average 1 billion per state annually but 
range from a high of 58 billion in california to a low of 82 
million in alaska the reports analysis the first of its kind is 
based on 1985 statistics

the african national congress said tuesday 
it has lobbied african governments to boycott proposed talks with 
south african president fw de klerk scheduled for this weekend in 
zaire 
the organization also urged european governments to ignore 
british calls to ease economic sanctions against south africa 
britain tuesday failed to persuade the european community to 
ease sanctions and said it would act alone to remove a british 
embargo on new investment 
de klerk in an effort to ease friction with black states is to 
meet saturday in zaire with the leaders of that country rwanda 
burundi chad and the african central republic to discuss regional 
issues and political developments in south africa 
togo and gabon may also be represented at the oneday meeting 
which would be the first multination conference between south 
africas whiteminority government and black african states said 
south african officials who declined to be identified south 
african presidents have had meetings with single black heads of 
state in the past 
the meeting could clear the way for south africa to start 
establishing political and economic ties with black africa after 
years of being isolated because of its apartheid policies the 
officials said south africa wants to expand economic ties to help 
stimulate its own economy they said 
de klerk is expected to brief the black leaders on his recent 
reforms including the feb 11 release of nelson mandela and the 
legalization of the anc and other antiapartheid groups 
in lusaka anc international affairs chief thabo mbeki said the 
organization had approached foreign ministers of the 50member 
organization of african unity currently meeting in addis ababa 
ethiopia and urged them to stop the zaire talks 
we see no reason for de klerk to be received oau policy is to 
isolate apartheid nothing has changed apartheid is still there 
every day mbeki told reporters in lusaka 
earlier tuesday the anc urged european governments to ignore 
british calls to ease economic sanctions against south africa it 
said it had appealed to all european community governments to 
coincide with a meeting of ec foreign ministers in dublin ireland 
british prime minister margaret thatcher has argued that the 
recent political changes introduced by de klerk deserve an easing 
of the world trade and investment boycott 
mbeki said the anc reminded european governments of an agreement 
in strasbourg last december by their leaders including mrs 
thatcher that sanctions would only be reviewed after there was 
profound and irreversible change to end the apartheid system of 
racial separation in south africa 
we are saying the ec ought to respect international agreements 
it enters into he said 
he said an easing of the sanctions would encourage de klerk to 
believe he had made sufficient reforms therefore he can take his 
time about ending apartheid and this is to prescribe further 
suffering for our people

leaders of the church of england were urged on 
tuesday to reject an unpublished report that recommends homosexuals 
be treated with more sympathy by the church 
the report was commissioned by the bishops in the churchs 
policymaking general synod who wanted advice on dealing with 
matters of homosexuality but they decided not to publish it 
the rev david holloway a traditionalist clergyman told the 
synods regular february session that leaked copies of the report 
indicated it contradicted a 1987 synod decision that homosexual 
acts fell short of the christian ideal 
he said the leaked version appeared to suggest that only 
onethird of the bishops held to the biblical and traditional view 
of the church which opposes homosexual relationships 
while most bishops in the words of the report would not 
sponsor or ordain anyone whom they knew to be homosexually active 
presumbly some would we need reassurances holloway said 
holloway sought an emergency debate to discuss church leaders 
who favored the homosexuality report but no debate or vote 
followed on the first day of the threeday session at westminster 
the synod is a 574member body of bishops clergy and laity 
archbishop of canterbury robert runcie said the bishops had no 
plans to authorize publication of the report 
it is not an accepted policy document it is advice and we are 
now considering it said runcie spiritual head of the church and 
leader of the worlds 70 million anglicans including 25 million 
us episcopalians 
holloway told reporters later the bishops suppressed the report 
for 18 months and when it was leaked it did enormous damage to 
the church 
what we want to discuss is the way we have got into the mess 
we have got into he said 
richard kirker general secretary of the lesbian and gay 
christian movement said the decision to repress the report runs 
contrary to principles of open government which apply in church if 
the church is not an unconditionally welcoming community determined 
by love we have no business to call ourselves christians 
the suppressed document is known as the osborne report after its 
chairwoman the rev june osborne a deaconess working in londons 
east end in 1986 the bishops asked the sevenmember working party 
of clergy and laity that she headed to advise them on how to 
handle homosexuality matters in the church of england 
the report was completed in 1988 but remained unpublished this 
month copies were leaked to a television company and some 
newspapers 
the 134page report as summarized in the anglican church times 
weekly said we have been made very conscious of the poor 
experience of the church encountered by many homosexual people 
the bishops have a particular responsibility to set a tone of 
welcome and acceptance in these matters 
a church times editorial on friday said the report offered 
people in the church of england the chance to reexamine their 
thinking about homosexuality 
it said the last synod debate on the subject in 1987 showed that 
numbers of churchpeople disapproved of it but that was no longer an 
adequate response 
there are probably at least a million homosexuals in the 
united kingdom the weekly said 
the church of england has homosexuals among its priests 
ordinands and worshipers these are people who have the same need 
for sexual expression in its many forms for companionship for 
acceptance as heterosexuals it becomes increasingly difficult to 
deny them those things and argue that the denial is merciful or 
truthful or practical

east german premier hans modrow pressed by 
mass emigration and a crumbling economy appealed tuesday for 
immediate reunification talks under a formula worked out with the 
allied victors of world war ii 
helmut kohl the west german chancellor urged modrows 
government to create a social security system as generous as west 
germanys as a means of stopping the flight 
kohl made a campaign trip to east germany lending his support 
to conservatives there and telling a rally of 90000 that his 
government will provide aid to help the troubled countrys social 
safety net 
the chancellor a christian democrat was repeatedly cheered by 
the large crowd in the city of erfurt who waved west german flags 
and shouted for quick unification 
he tried to justify his refusal to give massive aid to the 
current interim communistled government 
i was not ready to invest billions in a system if i cant see 
that the citizens will benefit kohl said 
the crowd responded by shouting helmut helmut 
more than 400000 people have left the east for west germany in 
the past year most of them skilled workers after giving up hope 
of significant improvement in living conditions at home 
kohl met with west german industrial leaders tuesday to draft 
plans for solidarity with east germany and told journalists 
his government would help finance unemployment benefits and 
pensions for east germans 
he was vague about the degree to which west germany would 
underwrite the costs of east germanys transition to capitalism 
however saying only that bonn could provide startup financing 
for the benefits 
his references to german social unity reflected a growing 
realization among west germans that they must pay for 
reunification kohls government has been reluctant to make firm 
deals with modrow a reformminded communist whose interim cabinet 
will govern only until free elections march 18 
east germanys parliament passed a constitutional amendment and 
legislation tuesday setting rules for the elections 
the new parliament will have 400 seats 100 fewer than the 
current peoples chamber and no minimum percentage of the vote 
will be needed for a party to win seats in west germany a party 
must get 5 percent of the vote 
modrow addressing the parliament said representatives of the 
two germanys should begin preparing the 2plus4 conference as 
soon as possible 
at a meeting in ottawa canada last week the united states 
soviet union britain and france agreed with east and west germany 
on a twostage plan for reunification 
in the first stage of what became known as the 2plus4 
formula german experts would discuss political economic and legal 
steps to unity in the second the germanys would be joined by the 
allies to discuss international ramifications 
modrow said parallel plans should be made for a meeting of the 
35nation conference on security and cooperation in europe 
he again expressed regret that bonn would not provide the 9 
billion in immediate aid he requested such aid is in my opinion 
necessary to counter a further exodus and this should be of common 
interest to both governments the premier said 
west germany has approved the equivalent of about 35 billion 
for projects over which modrows government has little control 
east and west germany should issue a statement guaranteeing 
polands western borders modrow said kohl concerned about 
conservative support in the december elections has not made a 
public unequivocal declaration that he recognizes those borders 
about onethird of poland was part of germany before world war 
ii and the poles have demanded inclusion in the 2plus4 
because of concern over possible german claims to its territory 
modrow supported that position monday but west germany has 
resisted it 
a joint government commission of east and west germany met in 
east berlin on tuesday to discuss ways of achieving monetary and 
economic unity 
earlier this month kohl offered to make the west german mark 
the official currency of both countries he said that would give 
east germans confidence in their future but the east germans fear 
unemployment as inefficient factories are forced to close under a 
more competitive capitalist system 
leaders of both countries hope monetary union will stem the 
flight of about 2000 people a day from east to west but no 
agreement is expected until after the march elections 
east germany is planning to end subsidies and modrow appealed 
to citizens tuesday not to hoard food he reported hearing of runs 
on grocery stores while prices remain low but journalists saw no 
unusual crowding at food stores in east berlin 
modrow urged people to keep their money in the banks east 
germans worry about their savings becoming worthless under a 
monetary union with west germany and have been withdrawing funds 
he also appealed to east germans to stay home and work for 
change

prince norodom sihanouk who ruled 
cambodia until he displeased the americans by keeping it out of the 
indochina war will return and live in a bamboo hut until his 
country is free a spokesman said tuesday 
sihanouk was overthrown in 1970 fled cambodia when the 
vietnamese invaded in december 1978 and has lived since in the 
palaces and luxury hotels of beijing pyongyang paris and bangkok 
he now leads guerrillas fighting the government of premier hun 
sen whom the vietnamese installed and spokesman ek seryewat said 
he would take up residence friday in a liberated zone of 
northeastern cambodia 
ek a spokesman for sihanouk in bangkok said the prince would 
live in oddar meanchey province bordering thailand in a house 
built of bamboo 
before returning to cambodia the 67yearold prince was 
scheduled to hold another round of peace talks wednesday with hun 
sen in bangkok their first meeting in thailand 
all parties involved in the cambodian conflict are scheduled to 
confer monday and tuesday in jakarta indonesia 
the threefaction guerrilla alliance sihanouk leads has made 
substantial gains in western and northwestern cambodia since 
vietnamese troops were withdrawn at the end of september 1989 
hun sen may live in a palace in phnom penh but there are no 
palaces in the liberated zone ek said 
he said sihanouk would continue to travel on diplomatic 
missions but his home would be in oddar meanchey until the 
liberation of the whole of cambodia 
international support has grown for a negotiated peace involving 
the united nations in an interim administrative role 
hun sens government has rejected guerrilla demands that it be 
dismantled before elections contending that would leave the way 
open for the khmer rouge to regain power 
the khmer rouge ruled cambodia from april 1975 until the 
vietnamese invasion and more than 1 million people were killed or 
died of starvation or disease it now is far stronger than either 
of the other two noncommunist guerrilla factions 
sihanouk and hun sen last met at the paris international 
conference on cambodia in august but their meeting and the 
conference achieved little 
the french put sihanouk on the throne of cambodia when he was 19 
and he led his country to independence in 1953 he was ousted by a 
rightwing coup in 1970 after resisting us attempts to draw 
cambodia into the war 
in rural areas of a nation that has known little but war for 
decades sihanouk still is revered as a godking who brought peace 
many of the old and new elite either dismiss him as irrelevant or 
consider him a traitor who helped destroy cambodia

a key responsibility of a tanker 
captain is delegating authority to other officers an exxon 
official testified tuesday at the trial of the skipper who gave 
control of the exxon valdez to his third mate 
however ship crew coordinator william deppe of walnut creek 
calif testified at the trial of former tanker skipper joseph 
hazelwood that he would have remained on the ships bridge during a 
maneuver to avoid hitting ice 
the exxon valdez was outside normal shipping lanes to avoid ice 
in prince william sound when it struck bligh reef ripping open its 
hull and spilling more than 10 million gallons of crude oil the 
disaster killed countless birds fish and marine mammals and 
blackened hundreds of miles of rocky shore 
deppe who holds a shore position with exxon represented the 
company at the national transportation safety boards hearing into 
the nations worst oil spill he also took control of the grounded 
exxon valdez after hazelwood left to meet with investigators 
deppe holds a captains license and assistant district attorney 
brent cole asked him numerous questions on how he would have 
handled the grounding of the exxon valdez deppe was reluctant to 
answer on many points saying he was not there and didnt have 
enough information 
but he appeared to support hazelwoods decision to let third 
mate gregory cousins navigate through prince william sound 
one of the responsibiltiies a master has is to delegate a lot 
of responsibility to other people he said if i had an officer 
i had confidence in to carry out commands deppe indicated he 
would trust him 
but when cole pressed him on what he would have done while 
steaming past ice in prince william sound he said i probably 
would have been on the bridge and not left it to the third mate 
hazelwood 43 is charged with seconddegree criminal mischief 
a felony and three misdemeanors reckless endangerment operating 
a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil if 
convicted he could be sentenced to 7 years in prison and 61000 
in fines 
deppe testified after jurors were shown a videotape of the exxon 
valdez sitting on bligh reef surrounded by floating black oil the 
man who shot the footage dan lawn then told of boarding the ship 
and encountering hazelwood who lawn said appeared sober 
lawn said that at one point on the morning after the accident 
he smelled what resembled stale beer on the captains breath 
deppe later testified that while exxon forbade alcohol on its 
ships the company did allow moussey a lowalcohol beer from 
france to be taken on board 
the defense appeared to be laying groundwork to contend that 
hazelwood drank moussey long after the accident explaining why he 
had a low level of alcohol in his blood 10 hours after the 
accident

the general assembly convened its first 
special session on narcotics tuesday with major drugproducing 
nations and major drugconsuming nations seeking to forge an 
international battle plan for the 1990s 
the fourday session is expected to shift the previous emphasis 
on stopping drug production in poor countries to a more balanced 
approach which includes fighting consumption in wealthier nations 
it is expected to consider wider issues of distribution 
marketing and money laundering the related arms trade and sale of 
manufacturing chemicals 
secretary of state james a baker iii told the session the 
most critical challenge facing the united states in combating 
narcotics abuse is the problem of domestic consumption 
as long as the demand for drugs by americans remains 
voracious our nation faces an endless uphill struggle to halt 
supply baker said 
a text of his prepared remarks was released by the state 
department 
the debate began with colombian foreign minister julio londono 
paredes telling the 159nation assembly that for too long the 
burden in the drug fight has been borne by a small number of 
developing nations 
action must be taken on many fronts he said including action 
against the production of manufacturing chemicals and against 
corrupt officials and increased aid to developing countries to 
reducing the demand for drugs 
paredes said colombia believes that to fight drugs there must be 
sustained growth in the producing countries and that requires the 
creation of jobs external financing and easier access of exports 
to external markets 
international cooperation is necessary he said but he 
emphasized the responsibility of each state to control drug 
trafficking responsibility also must include respect for the 
sovereignty of other states he said without using drug traffic as 
a lever for applying economic pressure 
the session with more than 100 speakers is an effort to 
develop a blueprint for international cooperation against illegal 
drug supply demand trafficking and distribution 
un officials said the session would not focus on production by 
poor third world nations where many farmers have little choice in 
cultivation but would look at a broad spectrum of issues the 
session aims to enhance the effectiveness of un agencies in the 
battle against drugs and seek more money for them 
mexicos attorney general enrique alvarez del castillo called 
drugs the universal social disease the plague of the modern 
world 
but he said mexico is opposed to the creation of all 
multinational military or paramilitary forces and added the 
sovereignty of peoples and territorial integrity are not open to 
discussion multilateral cooperation should rest on the principle 
of respect for the rights of others 
del castillo said his government supports application of an 
international legal framework 
he said it was pointless to debate whether producing or 
consuming nations were more to blame we all are responsible 
he said 
he noted that mexicos drug consumption is relatively low 
regular users numbering only about 8 percent of the population 
mostly urban youth 
brazils foreign minister roberto de abreu sodre said the 
focus has been on production of illegal drugs but today there is a 
greater understanding that effective action must address many 
facets from cultivation to consumption 
elimination of illicit crops he said only can be achieved 
through integrated programs of rural development that provide 
economically viable alternatives 
there also is growing concern to address the problem of the 
covert flow of arms to drug traffickers and to curb the 
participation of mercenaries in drugrelated criminal activities 
in his address baker expressed hope that a unled effort to 
act against drug smuggling will help the world come closer to 
ending the drug scourge 
he added that to be successful any such program must entail 
concrete commitments and be fully implemented by un agencies 
certainly we the member governments cannot ask the united 
nations to do things that we will not do at home he said 
bakers appearance at the session five days after the drug 
summit in colombia was aimed at reinforcing the high priority the 
bush administration is attaching to the drug issue

the senate on tuesday opened discussion of a 
contentious resolution remembering armenian genocide amid 
potential strains in usturkish relations and a rift between some 
republicans and the bush administration 
the resolution which would set april 24 as a day of remembrance 
of the armenian genocide of 19151923 is sponsored by senate 
minority leader bob dole rkan 
about 15 million armenians died during the period victims of 
the ottoman empires attacks on the ethnic group the ottoman 
empire is now turkey 
its time for the united states officially to commemorate 
the armenian genocide dole said on the floor of the senate 
for too long we have ignored history for too long we 
have failed to speak the truth about the tragedy of genocide 
it is time finally for all of us to do what is right 
turkey a nato ally is fiercely opposed to the measure and has 
objected to the term genocide to characterize what happened to 
armenians during the period 
turkish prime minister turgut ozal made his views known in 
meetings last month with dole and other senators 
i am deeply concerned that if the senate passes the 
resolution it will unwittingly slap the face of a very important 
nato ally said sen robert byrd dwva an opponent of the 
resolution and the only senator to speak against it tuesday 
he said passage of the measure could jeopardize the upcoming 
round of negotiations on base rights 
the turks already have banned ports of call by us 
nuclearpowered warships and barred flights by training missions 
into a gunnery range according to mike mcnamara who represents 
turkey 
byrd called genocide a specific legal term as defined by the 
geneva convention 
i do not know whether what happened to the armenians 
constitutes genocide he said whatever happened was wrong he 
said 
discussion was expected to continue until thursday when the 
senate is scheduled to vote to cut off debate with a cloture vote 
sixty senators are needed to end talk so a vote can be taken 
dole had 61 cosponsors when he introduced the resolution last 
year however the measure now has only 46 cosponsors 
what has changed is the launching of a massive lobbying effort 
against the resolution by the administration by the government 
of turkey by american businesses who operate in turkey and 
regrettably by some private organizations and individuals who 
ought to be supportive of the resolution 
the bush administration has publicly opposed the resolution 
although george bush indicated during the 1988 presidential 
campaign that he would be inclined to remember victims of the 
armenian slaughters 
sen paul simon dill quoted bush as saying in 1988 that the 
united states must acknowledge the attempted genocide of the 
armemians i would join congress in commemorating the victims of 
that period simon quoted bush as saying 
clearly a different signal is coming from the white house 
today simon said 
dole who said he was not trying to embarrass the turkish 
government said he is willing to introduce legislation to ban any 
possible reparations to the armenians

west german chancellor helmut kohl 
told a rally of 90000 cheering east germans tuesday that his 
government will provide massive aid to help the troubled countrys 
social safety net 
west german politicians who themselves face the voters in 
december are increasingly using east germanys election campaign 
to promote their own causes 
with plans for reunification moving quickly west german 
politicians are also trying to enlist supporters in east germany 
for future elections 
the west germans also are lending campaign support to their 
inexperienced sister parties in east germany and allied groups that 
have sprung up since the peaceful prodemocracy revolution in 
october and the ouster of the hardline communist government 
the countrys first free elections are on march 18 
kohl a christian democrat was lending support to east 
germanys conservatives he was repeatedly cheered by the large 
crowd waving west german flags and calling for quick unification 
the rally was organized by the socalled alliance for 
germany a group comprising the east german christian democrats 
the german social union and democratic awakening 
the christian democrats are trying to shake off 40 years of past 
association with the communists 
kohl took a swipe at the opposition social democrats and their 
veteran leader willy brandt saying brandt only one year ago 
dismissed german unity as unrealistic 
east german social democrats are widely predicted to win the 
march election brandt remains hugely popular in east germany and

the expected suspension of 13 striking 
united mine workers chilled any celebration in this eastern 
kentucky coal town over tuesdays end to the strike against the 
pittston coal group 
some area business owners and residents were relieved to hear 
that the umw rank and file in virginia west virginia and kentucky 
approved the contract 63 percent to 37 percent 
everybodys just tickled that its over said eva ryan who 
operates a motel in toler near the kentuckywest virginia border 
everybodys for the miners we want them to get what they want 
in the charleston wva area sighs of relief also replaced 
the tension 
we are overjoyed said mark spurlock a logan county 
commissioner it is always a source of concern to everyone in 
logan county when there is an interruption of work in the coal 
mines its hard on everyone specifically the miners 
when the mining industry gets sick logan county gets 
pneumonia were overjoyed that its been settled apparently with 
a contract thats well thought of by the miners who are going back 
to work 
gov gaston capertons spokesman also welcomed the announcement 
the governors principal viewpoint was that there are many 
families here who have suffered some real hardship during the 
10month coal strike said spokesman gc morse for their sake 
and their communities this is certainly a good day for west 
virginia 
the topic on the minds of many however was the fate of the 13 
miners the umw expects pittston suspend for alleged misconduct 
during the strike 
members of local union 5737 at mcandrews campaigned to defeat 
the contract because it failed to guarantee the 13 miners jobs 
three of them belong to the local in eastern pike county 
many miners had expected the local to handily defeat the 
contract as a statement of union solidarity for the 13 workers 
they spoke bitterly about the locals surprisingly narrow 
rejection of the agreement 93 votes in favor and 96 against 
to me its the end of the union said ann osborne the wife 
of a striking miner i still say a man who voted yes on that 
contract is no better than a scab who went to virginia 
mrs osborne who runs osbornes midnite video said the narrow 
vote in kentucky revealed a fatal crack in unity among the miners 
jack clevenger jr a retired miner said those who voted for 
the contract were independent people voting for themselves 
the high rate of approval for the contract probably will cause 
tension in the local he said 
its a sore and its going to take time to heal it but time 
will heal it clevenger said 
the specific allegations against the 13 miners would be detailed 
after contract ratification said glenn stanley the locals 
president the cases then would be turned over to an arbitrator for 
settlement 
dave scott a striking miner said the suspended miners were 
meeting in virginia to discuss their fates with umw vice president 
cecil roberts

the ruling sandinistas traded boasts 
and accusations with the opposition tuesday and outside observers 
checked everything from paper ballots to computers for the weekend 
election 
in the remote chance that we lose i will personally 
congratulate my adversary the way they do it in all the 
democracies opposition presidential candidate violeta barrios de 
chamorro said in a speech to 400 chanting supporters 
it was the second campaign speech billed as the last of her 
campaign by law campaigning stops at midnight wednesday and the 
united national opposition alliance that backs mrs chamorro held a 
rally sunday that she said would close out her public campaign 
president daniel ortegas campaign manager said the sandinistas 
would win an election certified as fair by international observers 
and predicted the united states would be friendlier afterward 
were optimistic about the future bayardo arce told 
reporters we expect president bush to divorce himself from the 
policies that he inherited from president reagan 
reiterating a sandinista campaign theme arce said a us 
embargo and washingtons support for the contra rebels were 
responsible for nicaraguas economic crisis 
he said the voters knew that and also know the efforts the 
government has made to implement policies to protect the poorest 
sectors of society 
alfredo cesar chief strategist for mrs chamorro predicted uno 
would win on sunday with 55 percent of the vote to 40 percent for 
the sandinistas 
arce said the sandinistas would relinquish power in the 
hypothetical case of an opposition victory but other 
sandinista officials have said they would not necessarily give up 
control of the army or police 
the military will have a place in our society but they will 
not be the directors of national life mrs chamorro said 
the whole thing is in ortegas hands cesar said in an 
interview if he concedes defeat theres nothing the others can 
do 
ortega agreed to the election as part of a central american 
accord also designed to disband the contra force organized in 1981 
two years after the sandinistas overthrew president anastasio 
somoza 
it pits the sandinistas against the 14party uno coalition and 
eight other parties a president vice president 90member 
national assembly and local officials are to be chosen for sixyear 
terms 
recent independent polls have shown the sandinistas leading but 
their accuracy is questionable because so many nicaraguans are 
afraid to reveal their true feelings to a stranger 
hotels were filled long ago by official observers unofficial 
observers and journalists some late arrivals said they were bumped 
despite numerous confirmations and sought beds in private houses 
every rental car in managua was gone by tuesday and the 
government was getting 100 a day plus mileage for battered 
sovietmade ladas official observer missions use white buses and 
fourwheeldrive vehicles 
among the observers arriving tuesday was elliot richardson a 
former us attorney general who heads the un team 
the mission has over the last week significantly increased its 
observer force amounting now to over 200 election monitors who 
will be deployed in 100 teams of two across the length and breadth 
of the national territory he said in a statement 
a practice runthrough of election procedures was being planned 
at the central election center the supreme electoral council 
issued a statement saying it would make the official count and 
issue the results however many observers were present 
arce congratulated mrs chamorro on the conciliatory tone of 
her final campaign speech sunday but said violent elements in 
the opposition were ignoring her 
he said 14 sandinista party activists had been killed by contra 
rebels since december and repeated accusations that mrs chamorros 
supporters hoped to obscure a sandinista victory with violence 
on monday the government said nine people had been killed in the 
past week in clashes with contras but claimed that was not an 
increase in rebel activity the civil war has continued at a low 
level despite the end of us lethal aid to the contras 
government sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
they did not expect any real disruption by the contras 
the opposition accused the sandinistas of political murder in 
the shooting death monday of fernando jesus moya jimenez an 
18yearold alliance activist relatives gathered tuesday at his 
coffin which was draped with a uno banner 
police said moya was shot while trying to rob a woman on the 
street 
in downtown managua where blocks of buildings wrecked in a 1972 
earthquake have not been rebuilt workmen constructed a podium and 
grandstands for the closing sandinista rally wednesday

he made the car into a trash can flexilease owner frank 
mcgrath said adding that downey defaulted on monthly payments 
spector said his client was out of town until next week and he 
would advise him not to comment because of the sensitive nature of 
bankruptcy filings

initially enjoyed good ratings after its debut in october 1987 but 
began a slide as downey repeatedly got in trouble with the law the 
show was canceled in september 1989 
downey was charged at least twice with assaulting guests on the 
show including a gayrights activist in april 1989 downey was 
acquitted on charges that he slapped the gayrights activist the 
other case was dropped

the fbi said tuesday it was investigating 
possible civil rights violations in the savage beating of a state 
prison inmate allegedly attacked by guards three of whom were 
suspended with pay 
corrections department spokesman joseph dinitto confirmed that 
three guards were suspended jan 17 in connection with the nov 19 
beating of donald r coulter who was held on a charge he assaulted 
his girlfriends 13monthold son 
we completed our investigation on these three people and 
feel that there might be some need for prosecution dinitto said 
fbi spokesman paul cavanagh in boston said the bureau had begun 
an inquiry at the request of corrections department officials and 
would work with federal prosecutors in providence as well as the 
justice departments civil rights section in washington 
i think it will be less complicated than some cavanagh said 
of the investigation but gave no details 
two other guards who cooperated in the investigation were put on 
administrative leave after they complained of harassment by their 
colleagues said john sabalewski president of the rhode island 
brotherhood of corrections officers 
dinitto refused to discuss those two guards but sabalewski 
confirmed that they alleged fellow guards had harassed them and 
refused to work with them 
they did have a hard time for various reasons but i dont 
want to get into them because the investigations still going on 
said sabalewski who would not identify them 
he said the administration had declined his offer to meet over 
the pairs grievances administrative leave doesnt solve 
anything he said if anything it creates a problem when they 
do come back they still have to deal with the problem 
dinitto said the three guards would remain suspended until a 
departmental hearing next week 
sabalewski called the process a farce and charged that 
discipline decisions were made beforehand he said the guards 
denied the charges 
theres a possibility the inmate was beaten before he ever got 
into the institution sabalewski said declining to elaborate 
coulter 33 of cranston who was charged with firstdegree 
child abuse was beaten so badly the day of his arrest that he was 
hospitalized and missed his court appearance the next day the 
providence journalbulletin reported 
he allegedly was cornered in a holding cell at the adult 
correctional institutions and beaten by guards the newspaper 
quoted an unidentified source as saying 
corrections officials refused comment at the time even after 
coulter was admitted to rhode island hospital with multiple 
bruises a swollen face and broken ribs doctors also found a 
spinal abnormality they said could have been caused by the beating 
the newspaper said 
coulter who has been unable to post 150000 bond remains in

britain on tuesday failed to persuade the 
european community to ease sanctions against south africa and 
announced it would go ahead and lift an embargo on new investment 
it said it had us support for such an action 
we need to give support to south african president de 
klerk who has taken his political life in his hands british 
foreign secretary douglas hurd declared after a daylong meeting of 
foreign ministers of the wealthy 12nation trade bloc ended in 
deadlock 
it is not enough to sit back and say thats encouraging 
lets see what you do next he said 
hurd said president bush wrote british prime minister margaret 
thatcher on tuesday analyzing the legal situation imposed by 
congress bush is prevented by congress from lifting sanctions 
until south africa fulfills strict conditions 
he bush went on to say the steps we are taking are positive 
and added that he feels very strongly that when someone does what 
you are asking him you should recognize that fact hurd said 
the foreign ministers rejected a british compromise to delay 
action if all 12 nations pledged to scrap the 1986 investment 
embargo when south africa lifts the state of emergency and to end 
all embargoes when black and white leaders start negotiations 
the community said in a statement that the whitedominated 
governments political reforms while welcome do not yet go 
far enough 
the ministers decided to send a threenation factfinding 
mission to south africa the countries france ireland and italy 
are the past present and next holders of the communitys 
rotating presidency 
hurd said while britain did not oppose the mission it did not 
meet the case it would be interpreted as a signal by the 12 
delaying rather than encouraging 
irish foreign minister gerry collins said unilateral action 
would damage the credibility of european political cooperation 
this would be a dangerous precedent and i would appeal to 
everyone here not to embark on such such a course 
collins said the community did agree to lift cultural and 
scientific restrictions on the understanding that our objective 
in doing this is to contribute to the ending of apartheid 
mrs thatcher ended those restrictions this month when president 
fw de klerk announced farreaching reforms including legalizing 
the african national congress and then releasing black leader 
nelson mandela 
she argues that unless de klerk can show some positive 
international response to his actions he could be toppled in a 
white backlash 
only portugal like britain a former colonial power in africa 
gave hurd some support before finally going with the majority 
hurd said britains long and often lone policy of opposing 
sanctions had paid off in persuading white south africans through 
encouragement to move away from apartheid 
he said britain will end the investment ban with an announcement 
in parliament by the trade department adding i see no reason 
for delay 
the ban on new investment is among the voluntary measues 
against south africa imposed by the ec in 1986 it also imposed 
four binding measures bans on importing south african gold coins 
iron and steel and on arms exports 
britain is the largest single foreign investor in south africa 
although several major british corporations and the londonbased 
barclays bank pulled out because of pressure from antiapartheid 
groups 
south africas biggest foreign trading partners are four ec 
nations britian west germany italy and france and the united 
states and japan 
in a separate development the foreign ministers urged that a 
35nation eastwest committee be set up to prepare for a summit due 
this year of the conference of european security and cooperation 
the summit is to address the effects of german unification on other 
nations 
earlier west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
pledged that a united germany would be a stabilizing force in 
europe and scrupulously honor existing borders 
italian foreign affairs minister gianni de michelis cautioned 
the european community not to focus exclusively on east germany in 
its review of the momentous developments in eastern europe his 
aides quoted him as saying the other emerging democracies should 
get equal attention 
genscher assured him that west germany shared this view 
also the ec ministers in a closing statement urged israel not 
to settle soviet jews in the occupied lands saying it would 
endanger the middle east peace process

finance minister michael wilson presented a 1990 
budget tuesday that tightens the governments belt squeezes 
payments to the provinces and in a highly unusual move levies no 
new taxes 
however canadians will still pay more to the government this 
year because tax increases left over from the 1989 budget take 
full effect in 1990 
in a move expected to calm jittery money markets the finance 
minister saved 23 billion to hold the conservative governments 
annual deficit to 2374 billion for the fiscal year ending march 
31 1991 
that deficit figure is only 417 million higher than wilson 
predicted last year and is lower than the 254 billion deficit 
expected for the current fiscal year 
the finance minister said at a news conference he believes his 
steps to control spending and the deficit should pave the way to 
lower inflation and interest rates 
i believe that we are going to see inflation come under 
better control and as we see that happen then we will be able to 
see that reflected in lower interest rates wilson said he did 
not say how quickly he expected interest rates to fall 
the bank of canada has kept interest rates relatively high to 
battle inflation and interest rates jumped sharply last week to 
shore up the sagging canadian dollar 
under the new budget federal spending will increase 34 percent 
to 1231 billion in 199091 from 119 billion in the last fiscal 
year 
but wilson said his measures to control spending increases 
including steps taken in december saved 25 billion 
other highlights of the 19901991 budget include 
transfer payments to the provinces will rise by 83 billion 
less than expected for a national increase of 3 percent ontario 
alberta and british columbia will receive only 23 percent more 
than last year and the poorer provinces will get 4 percent more 
for health postsecondary education and welfare 
spending on defense foreign aid science and technology will 
be limited to a 5 percent increase approximately the rate of 
inflation 
outright grants to business will be virtually eliminated and 
government loans will be harder to get 
canadians will still feel a heavier tax bite because increases 
announced in the 1989 budget take full effect this year taxpayers 
will pay 38 billion more in personal income taxes this year a 
91 percent increase from 1989 
wilson said his 1990 budget will help reduce the burden of 
carrying the governments 303 billion debt but the biggest 
improvement wont come for at least three years 
he said in his speech that tough times lie ahead for the 
canadian economy 
this will not be an easy year he told the commons which 
now must debate the budget 
finance department officials said the sevenyear economic boom 
in canada has come to an abrupt halt they said a recession 
defined as six months of negative economic growth is not forecast 
but is within the margin of error of wilsons predictions 
wilson said he expects the economy will grow about 13 percent 
this year after accounting for inflation down from 26 percent for 
1989 
but there will be little or no growth for the first six months 
of this year he said

president bush on tuesday presented the first 
charles stark draper award to two texas engineers who developed the 
semiconductor microchip an invention that helped america change 
the world 
jack s kilby and robert noyce working separately in the 1950s 
developed the microchip also known as the integrated circuit 
integrated circuits have enabled us to do the unimaginable 
bush said at an awards ceremony at the state department now it 
is unimaginable to believe we could ever live without them 
the microchip helped america change the world 
the integrated circuit incorporates a large number of 
transistors on a single tiny piece of silicon 
kilby is chief technical officer of the houston area research 
center noyce is president and chief executive officer of austins 
sematech a research consortium of high technology companies 
the two men who are recognized by the scientific and 
engineering community as independent coinventors of the monolithic 
integrated circuit will share the 350000 award 
the draper award for engineering achievement is sponsored by the 
national academy of engineering it was established in 1988 with an 
endowment by the cambridge massbased charles stark draper 
laboratory 
the prize will be awarded every two years to individuals who 
have contributed significantly to the advancement of engineering 
and whose achievements have produced important benefits to the 
wellbeing and freedom of all humanity 
bush said the microchip in addition to transforming everyday 
life with such items as computers and calculators has stirred 
the new breeze of democracy across the world 
during a visit tuesday with vaclev havel the new president of 
czechoslovakia bush said he thought about how the microchip had 
helped provide images that linked the peoples of prague and 
warsaw budapest and berlin images of bravery and defiance of 
humanitys quest for freedom 
and it was the microchip which carried those images from one 
nation to another becoming an instrument of liberty and the symbol 
of the information age 
microchips are used in products ranging from medical equipment 
to calculators and watches their invention provided for storing 
and manipulating information in a very small space replacing the 
need for miniaturized components such as transistors 
very few things have changed the world as dramatically as the 
integrated circuit robert m white president of the national 
academy of engineering said in a statement the development of 
the integrated circuit was the singlemost important event that 
helped to usher in the information age 
since kilby and noyce pioneered the chip the 
informationprocessing capacity of a single chip has doubled about 
every three years

president bush gave investment and trade 
rewards to czechoslovakia tuesday for overthrowing communist rule 
but told president vaclav havel the united states wouldnt retreat 
from a precautionary strong military presence in europe 
bush gave a warm welcome to the first of eastern europes new 
reform leaders to visit the white house 
he called havel a onetime dissident playwright who went from 
prison to the presidency in a years time a man of tremendous 
moral courage one of the heroes of the revolution of 89 
the two leaders talked for 2 hours in the oval office and over 
lunch 
afterward havel said the talks had been very warm very open 
very friendly and he invited bush to visit prague 
bush announced a waiver of the jacksonvanik amendment that 
restricts trade relations with communist nations that inhibit 
jewish emigration 
the waiver clears the way for negotiation of a trade agreement 
and the eventual award of mostfavored nation trading status which 
would provide czechoslovakia the most liberal access possible to 
american markets in return the czechoslovak parliament would have 
to enact a law ending the former communist governments restrictive 
emigration policies 
bush also authorized the exportimport bank to operate in prague 
and said he would support readmission of czechoslovakia to the 
international monetary fund and world bank bush authorized sending 
peace corps volunteers to czechoslovakia by autumn to teach english 
regarding military forces havel has called for disarmament 
throughout europe and has asked the soviet union to withdraw the 
75000 soviet troops in czechoslovakia some czechoslovak leaders 
have called for eventual dissolution of nato along with the warsaw 
pact the sovietled alliance to which czechoslovakia belongs 
interviewed on the macneillehrer newshour on public 
television havel havel said the soviets want to withdraw but are 
unable to feed and house the troops at home 
the security system was based on two conflicting blocks and 
this era is soon to be over havel said at this moment its 
not quite clear to me who could be a potential enemy of 
czechoslovakia 
asked if a play could be written about the experience of his 
country havel replied its a great drama with features of all 
dramatic genres from greek tragedy to absurdist drama but it is a 
play so thrilling and so peculiar that no earthling could have 
invented it and written it 
in his public comments bush said i know i can speak for all 
western leaders when i say that the atlantic alliance will continue 
to play a vital role in assuring stability and security in europe 
at this great and historic moment 
and america will continue to play its part including a strong 
military presence for our security and for europes said bush 
who has proposed that the united states and soviet union reduce 
their troops in central europe to 195000 on each side 
bush in the private discussions talked at length about a need 
for us troops in europe and portrayed nato as a stabilizing 
factor at a time of great transition said assistant secretary of 
state raymond seitz 
seitz quoted havel as saying there is no doubt about the 
stabilizing role of nato and the united states and he said the 
czechoslovak president agreed on a need for nato and us forces 
until new security structures emerge in europe 
bush said nato perhaps should have a broader role than at 
present seitz said 
moreover the official said bush told havel he did not 
envisage the us presence going on forever and ever and ever and 
ever it was contingent on the us presence being centrally 
welcomed in europe and that if the united states were no longer 
welcomed in europe the us forces would come home forthwith 
right away last one out turn out the lights 
havel told bush he expects soviet troops to be withdrawn from 
his country on a pretty prompt timetable 
discussing the turmoil in the soviet union havel told bush it 
was important that the soviet union not experience political 
earthquakes 
havel said that the difficulties plaguing the soviet union 
almost inevitably would have should things go sour almost 
inevitably have an impact on eastern europe indeed on all of 
eastern europe seitz said 
the czechoslovak president said he has no fears about german 
reunification so long as the new country is a democracy i 
wouldnt be afraid of a democratic country if it had 100 million 
people but i would be afraid of a totalitarian country with a 
million people he said 
havel who arrived in the united states on monday will address 
a joint session of congress on wednesday before traveling to new 
york for business political and cultural meetings he will return 
home thursday night next week he will make his first visit to 
moscow

foreign minister mesut yilmaz long viewed 
as a potential leader of the ruling party resigned tuesday 
reportedly over differences with the premier and other members of 
the government 
premier yildirim akbulut and yilmaz made separate statements to 
reporters on the resignation but both declined to give a reason 
turkish newspapers have reported in recent days that yilmaz of 
the ruling motherland party was irritated about criticism in the 
council of ministers while he was abroad and which had leaked to 
the press 
yilmaz 42 has been a member of all the governments of the 
ruling motherland party since the party founded by president 
turgut ozal came to power in the 1983 general elections that 
restored civilian rule 
he kept his post after ozal was elected president and in 
november akbulut became premier and formed a new government 
there has been speculation in the turkish press that yilmaz was 
preparing to challenge akbulut for party leadership 
the resignation came on the eve of a debate in the parliament on 
general foreign policy and turkeys recent problems in that area 
the problems have included a flareup of the feud with greece 
this time over the moslem turkish minority in western thrace 
protests by southern neighbors syria and iraq over turkeys use of 
the euphrates river waters the problems of the turkish minority in 
bulgaria and a resolution pending in the us senate that accuses 
ottoman turks of the genocide of armenians in world war i 
sen bob dole rkan sponsored the resolution and presented it 
tuesday 
turkey is fiercely opposed to the measure and objects to the 
term genocide to describe what happened to the armenians 
a demand by yilmaz that wednesdays foreign policy debate in the 
parliament be televised nationwide was viewed by akbulut as an 
attempt to upstage him and brought on the cabinet discussion and 
criticism of the foreign minister newspaper reports quoting 
unidentified cabinet members said

natures own cancercausing chemicals that 
are an unavoidable part of everything from pot roast to peanuts 
represent a greater health danger than pesticides and other 
pollutants a health official warns 
a new estimate by the us food and drug administration 
concludes that more than 98 percent of the cancer risk in the diet 
results from ordinary foods not from additives poisons or other 
manmade contributions to the food chain 
the risk is from natural carcinogens in the diet because they 
overwhelm all the others said dr robert j scheuplein director 
of the office of toxicological sciences at the us food and drug 
administration 
this does not mean that all food is dangerous or even that 
people can do much about the hazard instead scheupleins analysis 
was intended to focus attention away from what he sees as a largely 
bogus health issue the hazards of chemical contamination

efforts to predict the effects of global 
warming are being hurt by lack of access to 40 years of secret 
soviet and us military data on the north polar ice cap 
scientists said 
submarine sonar measurements of the thickness of the ice cap are 
crucial to understanding ocean currents underneath the ice cap 
said michael schlesinger of oregon state university 
those currents must be understood if researchers are to predict 
accurately the rate of warming of the earths climate as carbon 
dioxide is released into the atmosphere schlesinger said monday at 
the annual meeting of the american association for the advancement 
of science 
what i want is month by month the thickness of sea ice

if gay television characters turns up as 
a category on jeopardy david gadberry is ready 
steven carrington was a gay character a bisexual character 
then a gay character then a straight character gadberry says of 
the member of the dynasty clan 
jody on soap was flamboyant and considering a sex change 
operation and from there he became a gay character to a bisexual 
character to a straight character he says 
but gadberry 29 is not on a trivial pursuit he wants to 
change how television handles gays to a steven carrington who 
stays gay and gay couples included in scripts as regular characters 
for some reason i dont know why the industry seems to be a 
lot on the homophobic side gadberry said 
with no hope of seeing his plans on network television any time 
soon gadberry pinched his bank account and tapped local gay 
businesses for help to produce a onehour pilot called secret 
passions billed as a gay soap opera 
among the characters are a black lesbian city council candidate 
a gay jr ewing orange county land developer a gay male 
couple gadberry is one side of that relationship and a gay 
female couple a rock singer and her manager 
theres also the conservative crusading rev arthur dimsdale 
whose name is only one consonant away from the agonized puritan 
minister of nathaniel hawthornes the scarlet letter 
we have two men in bed we have kissing but were more 
suggestive than explicit said gadberry of the shows content 
its produced by his golden west productions inc located in of 
all places conservative orange county 
the 12000 pilot has been shipped to at least 19 markets for 
public access cable shows the fringe of the market through which 
gadberry hopes to make his way to the middle among the cities 
where viewers can catch the show are new york los angeles 
cincinnati chicago st louis houston san francisco nashville 
and seattle 
gadberry whos made a media blitz with talk show appearances 
and interviews will appear on donahue next week from los 
angeles 
his critics have called him a publicityhungry vendor pushing a 
bad show 
we dont think its a threat said steve sheldon of the 
conservative traditional values coalition also based in orange 
county i think its interesting that they spend more time on 
public relations than production but its clear the intention of 
the soap opera is to change values through the media 
agreed says gadberry an orange county native who attended 
golden west college a twoyear school and lives with his parents 
suffering from the flu he picked up while in new york for a talk 
show he gave a recent interview at home encased in a plaid 
bathrobe 
gadberry said sheldon is nonchalant because were in a 
position where he cant do anything they might want to boycott us 
but we dont have any sponsors 
he conceded that fellow gays also have questioned the quality 
and direction of secret passions after viewing its first and 
only episode gadberry is currently seeking funding for additional 
episodes 
we are going to present some of the stereotypes he said 
and then gradually we are going to knock down the stereotypes and 
present the real person 
gadberry wants to move from public access channels to cable 
programming agreeing with others that network television is not 
ready for his characters or story lines from him or any other 
source 
when thirtysomething showed its homosexual character russell 
in bed with another man last november the show lost about 15 
million in advertising according to reports 
officials from nbc cbs and abc all declined to comment about 
the prospects of gay couples on network television 
i dont think were going to see anything like this on the 
three main broadcast networks anytime soon said larry gerbrandt 
a television programming analyst with paul kagan associates 
what gadberry has on his side are time cables 
narrowcasting capabilities and the lure of advertising 
a demographic analysis by simmons market research bureau 
rivendell marketing co showed gay individuals incomes average 
about 36800 while gay households average 55400 against the 
us average of 36500 
nearly 60 percent are college educated and 49 percent hold 
professional and managerial positions the analysis showed 
gadberry has established a 900 number for those seeking 
broadcast times for secret passions and says inquiries have 
come from around the country right there that tells me that 
theres a market that the american public is at least curious 
he said

an exodus from ireland over the past decade has 
left tens of thousands of irish men and women in the united states 
without legal status while most of the illegals congregate in 
cities such as boston and new york an underground railway of 
priests nuns pub keepers and others is helping them find refuge 
all across the country

call them the illegal irish the undocumented 
irish the outofstatus irish or the just plain new irish 
but call them if theres a job or an apartment available begs 
sister veronica dobson who came here 30 years ago from county 
carlow to work among mexicans crossing the border into texas and 
now runs an outreach program for irish immigrants in boston 
and please call she adds if theres a stick of furniture 
available for them to start a new life 
nobody knows for sure how many irish between the ages of 17 and 
30 have unlawfully overstayed their visas in the united states in 
the past eight or nine years since the irish economy went sour 
estimates range from 60000 to 150000 they live haunted by the 
fear often exaggerated but real enough of being turned over to 
immigration authorities 
but theyre not always unwelcome 
theyre handy at carpentry and bricklaying so landlords and 
the neighbors like having them around says the rev gerard 
burns whose bishop in galway sent him to the dorchester section of 
boston with the rather vague assignment of visiting the bars the 
hurling grounds and dance halls to minister to a runaway irish 
flock 
as it was in the flight from the potato famine nearly a century 
and a half ago boston or new york is their first safe harbor but 
an underground railway of priests nuns pub keepers lawyers even 
congressmen and aldermen is helping them find refuge in ports of 
call from galveston texas to san francisco 
a congressman from bostons dorchester section brian donnelly 
dmass has become a household word in ireland as wellknown 
as the pope or john f kennedy says irish consul general liam 
canniffe for sponsoring the donnelly visa that since 1986 has 
helped thousands immigrate from 36 mostly european countries of 
the 15000 donnelly visas granted last year on a lottery basis 
ireland won an astounding 12000 
last st patricks day 900 irish men and women seeking legal 
status attended a visa clinic in dorchester and hundreds more 
lined up for applications at a ballroom in new york citys woodside 
area another haven for the new irish 
the exodus of young people in the past decade has so depopulated 
parts of western ireland where the unemployment rate is nearly 50 
percent that parish priests in rural mayo and galway cant put 
together a dance as burns puts it the gaelic football team in 
waterville disbanded for lack of a 15man starting lineup 
meanwhile bars like cuchulainns the emerald isle and the 
blarney stone on dorchester avenue and hundreds more from boston to 
baltimore import bands such as the dingle spike and tf 
much from ireland for the packed weekend dances many young men 
of 20 said goodbye the theme song of the new wave of 
immigration dampens many an eye 
the newcomers gave the kiss of life to gaelic games in this 
country avows the rev martin keaveny who was the first priest 
sent over by the irish bishops to work as a chaplain among the 
illegals at the urging of cardinal john oconnor making the rounds 
of their homes playing fields and bars along the irish mile in 
the bainbridge section of the bronx in new york he often runs into 
young people from his parish back in mayo 
monday night when video tapes of sundays hurling and football 
matches are flown in from ireland is prime time for pastoral pub 
crawling 
the big provincial championships and allireland finals are 
brought in live by satellite at 20 dollars a ticket keaveny 
says sports and the church are the two anchors linking them to 
home 
i could sit all day in st ambroses rectory across the street 
and no one would call says burns sitting at a back table at 
cuchulainns near a poster announcing irish daily and provincial 
newspapers on sale every tuesday and a bulletin board papered 
with pleas for jobs and apartments you got to go where the 
people are 
and the bar is where they are agrees innkeeper kieran 
staunton a legal immigrant from mayo the bar is their bank 
their employment agency their apartment finder their social club 
as well as the cure for loneliness 
the undocumented irish as he prefers to call them are 
reluctant to open bank accounts for fear of having their bogus 
social security numbers exposed and their funds confiscated by the 
authorities 
they pay cash for everything even tools or a used truck 
needed on the job they cant go into business for themselves 
without a credit rating staunton says theres no building a 
future not knowing from one day to the next if youll be deported 
they cant even join a union which is shocking when you consider 
that the secret organizations like the molly maguires built the 
union movement in this country

a century and a half ago irish laborers digging canals laying 
railroad tracks and working in the coal fields banded together in 
secret societies for protection against ruthless contractors who 
underpaid and overworked them in hazardous conditions and often 
absconded with the payroll 
undocumented aliens are not eligible for food stamps medicare 
or other federal programs 
very few apply for relief says sister veronica theyre 
here to succeed going from the irish dole to the welfare rolls 
here would be an admission of defeat a blow to their pride 
thanks to a national education system that makes higher 
education available to anyone qualified this generation is the 
best educated in irelands history and has the worlds highest rate 
of computer literacy 
computer training comes early in our education scheme 
explains consul canniffe wang digital and most of the major 
software and hardware firms have plants in ireland 
the new irish compete with an even larger influx of asians and 
central americans for jobs that have become much scarcer since the 
1986 immigration reform act made employers liable for stiff fines 
for hiring illegals 
with irish income taxes and health taxes that can eat up 65 
percent of a paycheck architects and engineers can make more here 
as construction workers or behind the counter in a jewish 
deli says burns and girls with the highest accounting skills 
find themselves six or seven years later still minding children or 
looking after old people 
like their forebears many work longer hours for less pay 
without vacation or retirement benefits and no compensation if hurt 
on the job they fall prey to greedy landlords loan sharks and 
unscrupulous immigration lawyers 
these shysters ask a down payment of 1000 and promise a 
green card in two years staunton says four years later youre 
still paying and no green card in sight 
the priest and the publican swapped other recent examples of 
exploitation a maid held in virtual slavery by a detroit couple 
who had confiscated her passport a new hampshire woman who 
advertised in irish newspapers for domestics at 200 a week but 
paid two girls who came out only 50 a week until they worked off 
their air fare all were hesitant to go to the police 
timothy whelan deputy district director of the us immigration 
and naturalization service in boston regrets that despite the 
immigration reform act some employers still resort to 
underthetable deals accepting fraudulent documents that wouldnt 
fool anybody else 
his agents recently moved in on a south shore nursing home 
operator who hired 11 illegals as orderlies and nursing aides 
through ads in the dublin papers promising green cards 
for openers we confiscated his mercedesbenz says whelan 
who is reconciled to being regarded as something of a villain 
by the irish 
but i have a responsibility under the law and im not 
insensitive to their plight my father came from cork i made a 
trip there last year i play the bagpipes tears come to my eyes 
when i hear the clancy brothers sing four green fields 
sure we nab three or four now and then but i dont wear my 
black hat all the time we could raid those irish bars every 
weekend and pick them up by the hundreds but we have more 
important priorities aliens involved in criminal activities like 
the drug traffic keep us plenty busy 
canniffe is relieved that so far irish illegals havent 
contributed much to crime in boston but i dont like to see them 
getting involved in underthetable jobs living on the margin of 
society outside the law is very dangerous most want to be 
honest but if they find themselves treated as outlaws they might 
be induced into more serious illegal activities 
burns also sees the danger to be out of work in ireland is no 
disgrace to be out of work in boston is devastating they come 
here figuring things couldnt be any worse and dont know what 
theyre getting into in ireland you never worry about getting sick 
or growing old here they worry about paying to send the kids to 
parochial school 
most of the new arrivals look upon boston new york chicago or 
wherever as a refueling stop on the road to a better life 
the pull for home is very strong with them says sister 
veronica they plan to put a little something aside for a house 
and a car and go home someday 
home home says tavern keeper staunton with just the trace 
of a jeer and a sigh thats all they ever talk about around 
here some are here up to eight years and still dreaming about 
going home its only a 7hour jet ride but i know of several who 
wouldnt go back for their mothers funeral for fear of not getting 
back in here

while the irish economy is improving officials 
predict that a migration of young people from the country will 
continue throughout the 1990s 
liam canniffe the irish consul general in boston and a trained 
economist says the exodus of our young people to england 
australia canada and the united states will continue at least 
until the year 2000 
its a matter of demographics half our population in under 27 
years old we need to provide 30000 jobs a year to keep them at 
home even if we had a phenomenal growth like taiwan or korea we 
couldnt do it this year well get 18000 of those needed jobs so 
the amount having to go abroad will be dramatically reduced but 
the problem wont go away 
meanwhile unemployment is down in ireland from 27 percent to 16 
percent and inflation has been cut to 21 percent the lowest in 25 
years

the disintegration of the iron curtain in europe 
has brought the reunion of families divided for decades refugees 
who managed to reach the west are returning to their homeland to 
find their relatives who were not so lucky one who went home 
recently was ap correspondent denis d gray this is his story 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
nearly four decades after fleeing 
my homeland as a little boy i walked past the house where i was 
born past the 15th century cathedral where generations of my 
family were married at the end of an avenue dusted by morning 
snow i rang a doorbell 
a lady with white hair appeared for a few moments we looked at 
each other silently then fell into a long embrace zdenku 
zdenku aunt vlasta sobbed we knew you would come back one 
day we knew you would come home 
thirtynine years ago i had leaped off a moving train into the 
darkness and run through frontier forests that gave cover to 
thousands of us refugees fleeing the stalinist gloom into which 
eastern europe was receding 
i knew nothing about communism or the iron curtain and little of 
what we myself my mother younger sister and our guide were 
doing that summer night in 1951 
but filtered through a childs sensitivity the forest rustle 
became a sinister pursuer and with the dawn caught exposed in a 
wheat field came palpable terror our mysterious guide was 
grappling with a border guard and all of us were running running 
 
we survived crossing the czechaustrian border and finally 
being smuggled into that great refugee haven of the cold war the 
sector of vienna occupied by american forces 
ahead was a joyful reunion with my father who had been forced 
to flee a year earlier and decades of freedom for me and family 
we severed our links to the past gave up traditions property 
friendships and even our czech names 
the country and relatives we left behind went through the iron 
rule of the 1950s the dashed hopes of the 1968 prague spring and 
then last years bloodless uprising which allowed me to 
reestablish ties without fear that my relatives would be 
jeopardized 
on the afternoon of my return uncle slava called my father in 
california the two brothers very close as boys and young men 
had not talked to each other since 1950 when my father a rising 
young politician vocally opposed to communist rule was warned of 
his impending arrest and managed to flee with the help of a roman 
catholic priest 
that evening uncle and aunt cousins and their children three 
generations that ideology had separated from me talked and 
talked we planned the coming days together and brought out bottles 
of the slightly bitter beer for which pilsen is renowned 
to a new better czechoslovakia we toasted 
what happened last year our velvet revolution was 
indescribably wonderful although i wont live long enough to enjoy 
its fruits my 76yearold uncle said but perhaps my children 
or grandchildren will 
two of the grandchildren lovely and lanky petra and michaela 
proudly told how they organized protests and traveled to factories 
and farms to explain democratic demands petra a molecular biology 
student at pragues charles university had donned a santa claus 
outfit to deliver sacks of coal and potatoes to the doors of 
communist leaders to mock and rattle the fallen order 
while both talked of job opportunities and perhaps scholarships 
in the west the stories of my uncle and aunt sadly showed that 
they and their generation could have made far more of their lives 
and abilities 
welleducated and capable slava was running factories and other 
businesses owned by his inlaws before the 1948 communist takeover 
then all the businesses were summarily nationalized without 
compensation and slava spent seven years in forests chopping down 
trees

during the stalinist era many people in pilsen disappeared 
others less lucky than ourselves were shot or captured trying to 
breach the iron curtain slava was shadowed threatened and 
interrogated about my father by the stb the dreaded secret police 
that was recently abolished 
in the 1960s while i was attending yale university and my 
father was succeeding as an executive at ibm in paris and new york 
slava was employed as an administrator at an institute of physical 
education eva one of his daughters with whom i played as a child 
was refused admission to the college of her choice because of her 
bourgeoiscapitalist background 
slava retained his dignity and a sense of humor but like most 
czechs eva told me her father made his compromises with a system 
he privately detested but felt incapable of changing he kept a low 
profile and avoided the ideologues he focused his life on his 
familys happiness and as much economic wellbeing as was possible 
the prague spring brought momentary hope to my relatives as it 
did to millions of czechs they began exploratory contact through 
letters to an aunt then the soviet tanks came 
good day my uncle greeted a passerby as we strolled 
together through pilsen your father knew that man he says to 
me he was pilsens master tailor in 1968 he took out an old 
american flag and flew it for that he was made a furnace stoker 
it happened to many 
we walked through the streets and main square of the inner city 
my uncle convincing me that my vague remembrance of old world charm 
was not mere nostalgia but grime now coated once stately 
residences and even historic buildings were dilapidated behind 
painted facades slava pointed to the scaffolding around the citys 
symbol the cathedral tower 
for each of the past six years newspapers wrote that the 
tower would be repaired by years end he said with a wry smile 
but in this great workers state they couldnt even organize the 
clearing of the meterthick layer of pigeon droppings in the 
belfry 
the past 41 years have been an endless parade of stupidities 
the state robbed the people and the people tried to rob the 
state my uncle said work and ability didnt matter more 
important was turning up for the may 1 parade 
eva sensitive and perceptive described people as sleepwalking 
through the work week speaking one way and thinking another even 
avoiding friendships for fear of betrayal 
we withdrew into ourselves and our families we longed for the 
saturdays and sundays she said now lets hope that we can 
look beyond and treat one another with more kindness 
before i left the city of my birth i had a private reunion with 
someone i had missed most over the years perhaps because i never 
got to know the full man and because boys make idols of their 
grandfathers 
his grave lay on the crest of a hill watched over by pale 
birches and barren oaks bending to an icy wind patches of snow and 
flowers withered by winter covered the raised earth 
it just cant go on like this the communists are bound to 
crack soon my uncle said grandfather told him before he died in 
1965 full of hope until the end 
in his youth grandfather had dreamed of a czechoslovakia 
independent of the austrohungarian empire so he deserted the 
emperors army alongside the allies he fought at verdun and other 
murderous battlefields of world war i 
independence was won but the communists would take away 
grandfathers property his basic freedoms and in a sense half 
his family his son my father stood up bravely until hopeless 
odds drove him into exile 
now a third generation of our family is trying for a more decent 
czech way with michaela marching on the streets of prague and 
petra playing santa claus to thumb his nose at the old communist 
leaders

its perhaps the most famous promenade in the 
world the champs elysees the onceelegant avenue that was the 
epitome of paris but the schlock of urban living is spoiling the 
vista today the grande dame of avenues has become a bit tacky 
its time for a new dress some paris leaders say and already the 
designers are at work

thomas jefferson would have been aghast to see the 
garish billboards the hamburger joints and the street vendors 
lining the champs elysees 
charles dickens no stranger to the seamier side of london 
would have been taken aback at the sight of deformed beggars 
selling pencils to leatherjacketed youths along the famed avenue 
which he favored for its country flavor 
and napoleon the embodiment of the grandeur of france might 
have been enraged to see a ragged toothless fireeater cavorting 
in the shadow of his majestic arc de triomphe 
indeed these and other former habitues of the champs elysees 
once the most beautiful avenue in the world would wonder what in 
the world has happened to the old neighborhood 
its hardly the champs elysees of legend a magical haven of 
luxury and leisure fabled in song and fiction and celebrated on 
the silver screen offering a breathtaking vista sweeping from the 
place de la concorde to the triumphal arch commemorating napoleons 
victories 
but thanks to an ambitious project unveiled in january by city 
officials the champs elysees will get a badly needed face lift a 
chance to reverse its decline into mediocrity 
thomas jefferson the third us president lived on the champs 
elysees while he was ambassador to france from 1785 to 89 so did 
victor hugo and charles dickens who disdained the headiness of 
left bank literary society for the quiet of the champs 
marcel proust played in the gardens at the rond point and after 
world war ii dwight d eisenhower directed the allied forces 
operations from his headquarters overlooking the champs as the 
avenue is known for short 
they would hardly recognize the champs today with its 
bumpertobumper traffic and oversized sidewalk cafes that force 
pedestrians onto the road 
the champs elysees should once again become the privileged 
place for promenades it was designed to be and once again 
become the most beautiful avenue in the world mayor jacques 
chirac told reporters 
the plan expected to cost from 26 million to 36 million and 
take four years to complete calls for eliminating the carjammed 
side alleys running parallel to the main street which is 6266 
feet long 
in their place sidewalks will be widened to 70 feet and paved 
with multihued granite slabs laid out in geometrical designs two 
new underground parking garages will replace the 390 spaces lost 
the piece de resistance will be a second row of more than 300 
plane trees to be staggered several feet behind the existing lane 
thus reinforcing the luxuriance of the 233footwide avenue 
the brainchild of pierreyves ligen a veteran urban planner 
whose accomplishments include overseeing the revamping of the 
louvre museum in the mid1980s the overhaul also will target the 
giant billboards hanging on buildings along the champs 
theres no reason why the worlds most beautiful avenue should 
be used like a christmas tree with any old thing hanging on it 
ligen says under his plan billboards will be allowed only on 
ground and first floors 
fastfood restaurants with their brightly colored logos 
familiar worldwide also will have to tone down their decor 
some cafes and restaurants may have to reduce or even eliminate 
their sidewalk terraces 
pedestrians shouldnt have to step over subway vents just 
because a terrace has taken over half the sidewalk ligen says 
and in the hope of luring back highclass hotels the stone 
facades of several large buildings will be classified as historical 
monuments 
a similar maneuver saved fouquets the legendary champs elysees 
restaurant and bar that has catered to the worlds film industry 
for generations and is one of the few remaining establishments 
serving up traditional fare in a comfortable setting 
but to roland pozzo di borgo president of the champs elysees 
committee which represents 200 store owners and managers the 
avenue is fine just the way it is 
the champs is simply evolving along with the new lifestyle and 
needs of those who frequent it 300000 people daily according to 
police officials he says 
those strollers enjoy the varied nonstop street life a choice 
among about two dozen firstrun movies 24hour kiosks selling 
newspapers and magazines from around the world a giant music 
store and competing auto showrooms serving hamburgers and banana 
splits 
though pozzo di borgo supports the mayors plan he says his 
group worries that prolonged construction will hurt business 
his biggest headaches he says are the many vagrants and street 
vendors illegally hawking everything from giant balloons to roasted 
chestnuts and who flock back to the champs despite repeated police 
raids 
despite the crowds the champs elysees is one of the safest 
areas in paris police say 
for the vendors it is also one of the most lucrative pozzi di 
borgo claims a choice location on the champs costs each vendor 
between 1700 and 2600 paid to an underground organization that 
furnishes the goods posts lookouts and collects the profits 
many blame the decline of the champs elysees on skyrocketing 
rents and the rer the regional express transit line that links 
eastern and western suburbs and has a major stop at etoile under 
the arc de triomphe 
the rer has brought in a young suburban population on a beer 
budget says andre parinaud secretary general of the 
organization remontons les champs elysees up the champs elysees 
the stores offer what they can afford beer records and 
sandwiches 
the only furclad visitors he says are the foreign tourists 
taking in some of the glamour at the lido nightclub one of the few 
surviving champs elysees institutions 
parinaud accused pozzo di borgos group of being too concerned 
with shortterm profits 
cultural values are more important than economic ones he 
says his group is urging a cultural renaissance with more 
theaters a cultural center and no more hamburger joints and pizza 
parlors 
laid out in 1667 by jeanbaptise colbert finance minister under 
louis xiv the champs elysees was designed to extend the sightline 
of the tuileries palace since destroyed by fire and surround it 
with wide treelined walkways that the king could admire from the 
salon of his royal residence at the louvre

elysees was toppled and the site was renamed square of the 
revolution 
1793 a guillotine known as the national razor was 
erected especially for the beheading of king louis xvi and later 
queen marieantoinette charlotte corday and other victims of the 
reign of terror 
1829 a 75foot obelisk in pink granite and weighing more than 
220 tons was erected at what is now called the place de la concorde 
1885 victor hugos body lay in state for a night under the arc 
de triomphe shrouded in black crepe before the long funeral 
procession carrying his body from the champs to his burial at the 
pantheon

lured to bolivia by cheap land prices and 
exemptions from military service and public schooling in the 1960s 
colonies of the mennonite religious sect have prospered in the 
south american country growing cotton and soybeans but now there 
is trouble in paradise some of the brethren fell victim to loan 
sharks and are now in prison for failure to pay their debts

the world that abraham groening and 
his mennonite ancestors fled for 400 years has caught up with him 
the onceproud farmer who is 45 years old and has 13 children 
is confined to a squalid local prison because of debts to loan 
sharks 
i sold off everything i had but it wasnt enough he told a 
visitor now i dont even own my own bed and here i am 
a borrower who falls behind on payments can be imprisoned in 
bolivia where the law equates incurring bad debts with criminal 
fraud 
six brethren share both groenings predicament and his cell 
block hundreds of others have managed to avoid prison but also 
were victimized squeezed after borrowing at exorbitant interest 
rates or guaranteeing the loans of others 
they couldnt read the fine print said menno ediger an 
overseas volunteer for the pennsylvaniabased mennonite central 
committee they arent well educated they arent equipped to 
deal with the outside world 
such was the case of groening i borrowed 4000 but the debt 
grew faster than i could pay it back he said in two years he 
owed 40000 he said 
groening has spent six months in the santa cruz jail and has 
yet to have a court hearing he could receive a sentence of several 
years in prison 
to keep himself busy he cuts out wooden puzzles by hand with a 
jigsaw 
some of his fellow prisoners already have been jailed for a year 
or more and some have found more worldly ways to pass the time the 
gaunt and dazed expressions of some of the prisoners signal drug 
abuse use of bazuka a cheap and often contaminated form of 
cocaine is common among prisoners 
at the prison in the tropical brush outside the city the 
mennonites are painfully surrounded by the trappings of modern life 
shunned by their creed 
rock music blares from portable stereos televisions drone in 
the cell blocks and in the flyinfested prison canteen 
broadcasting soccer games and soap operas wall posters warn about 
the danger of aids there is no prison farm no work programs 
the scandal has darkly clouded life in the 16 mennonite colonies 
scattered across the sandy scrubcovered plains outside santa 
cruz in south americas barely tamed amazonian heartland 
it is inspiring some believers to move on continuing a 
migration that dates back centuries to the sects origins 
the mennonites arose from among swiss anabaptists in the 1530s 
and took their name from a dutch protestant reformist menno 
simons belief in the bible adult baptism and nonresistance are 
fundamental but within the sect currents range from extremely 
conservative to liberal 
most of those in bolivia are socalled old colony mennonites 
and resemble the amish that broke away from the main church 200 
years ago they speak a low german dialect dress simply in 
overalls or frocks with widebrimmed straw hats and educate their 
many children at home they reject most modern technology making 
their livings as farmers or craftsmen and riding about in 
horsedrawn buggies 
they try to avoid unnecessary contact with what they call the 
world they are prohibited from working outside their colonys 
borders and are barred from using rubber tires on their tractors 
it might tempt someone to take a ride into town instead they use 
spiked steel wheels unsuitable for pavement 
over the centuries their fundamentalism has forced periodic 
migrations to russia canada and mexico among many other 
countries 
they began flowing into bolivia mostly from mexico and belize 
in the 1960s about 6000 to 7000 came in all since then 
sporadic new arrivals and births have swelled their numbers to 
about 20000 
as in previous migrations they were attracted to bolivia by 
cheap land and special government exemptions from military service 
and public schooling they also received an exemption from import 
duties for farm equipment 
many were escaping pressure to culturally conform 
its always the conservative ones who find the world is 
getting too close ediger says they came here because they 
wanted to preserve or get back to a way of life threatened by the 
advance of technology

program directed at the colonists

ediger is sharply critical of fundamentalism but confesses a 
grudging admiration for the old colony adherents strength and 
independence youve got to hand it to them he says they 
came here and started from scratch hacking and burning the brush 
and building their homes 
pat gavagan a roman catholic expriest from britain who farms 
land adjacent to a mennonite colony called the sects members 
absolutely brilliant at working with their hands 
theyre terribly confident they can go anywhere even the 
middle of nowhere and make a life at farming he says and the 
thing is they can do it 
the colonists did not arrive in bolivia emptyhanded many 
brought seed money in the form of savings and profits from selling 
their land in mexico or elsewhere they imported new tractors 
combines and other expensive farm equipment 
they began quickly turning a profit in the new colonies first 
growing cotton and nowadays mostly soybeans in the sandy soil 
around santa cruz they now produce about 70 percent of the 5 
million in soybeans exported by bolivia 
the colonies with their sturdy brick bungalows are models of 
neatness flaxenhaired children and big farm dogs frolic on the 
welltended lawns 
their affluence attracted attention not all of it good their 
stores and homes sometimes have been robbed by gunmen who learned 
that the mennonites because of their pacifism dont fight back 
bankers sought out their business appreciating the colonists 
reputation for thrift and honesty 
in the mid1980s an economic crisis left most bolivians with 
little cash and less credit lenders aggressively sought out the 
mennonites who also were feeling the squeeze and for the first 
time in bolivia were obliged to borrow against their crop 
in 1986 the bankers printed up leaflets that said mr 
mennonite come and borrow from me ediger recalls they 
spread them around the colonies 
in many cases however the bankers did not lend the money 
themselves they steered the naive mennonites to friends who ran 
shady loan agencies that offered us dollars at usurious rates 
up to 5 percent or more a month 
ediger estimates at least 300 mennonites were fleeced in the 
scheme in many cases the colonies are having to use common money 
normally saved for buying land to pay off the debts 
some of the imprisoned mennonites get visits from relatives who 
must travel for hours by bus on dusty roads from the colonies but 
others have fallen into disgrace and even their wives and children 
now shun them 
they dont come here anymore enrique jiesprecht boll 43 
said of his wife and five children other people are telling them 
not to come 
he has been in the prison 16 months and has yet to receive a 
sentence 
some of the prisoners even have been banned a form of 
excommunication in which close contact even with immediate family 
members is prohibited among those banned was a debtor who became a 
trusty driving the prison truck to town on errands the 
fundamentalist code prohibits driving of automobiles and trucks 
there are colonists who feel the jailed mennonites were victims 
of their own greed or sloth some werent workers says franz 
rempel a 39yearold cabinet maker in a colony called swift 
current southeast of santa cruz 
when you take out a loan you have to work to pay it back 
some didnt know how to do that 
according to colonists the borrowers were naively trying to 
repeat the profits that could be made by borrowing pesos in the 
early 1980s when devaluation outpaced interest rates with 
inflation running at five digits a loan in pesos equivalent to 
1000 in 1983 could be paid back a year later with the equivalent 
of just 75 a government austerity program put an end to high 
inflation and the accompanying financial speculation in 1985 
margaretha ediger maintains however that the indebted 
mennonites have more than paid for any sins their crimes are 
nothing compared to the crimes of those the lenders who are 
keeping them in prison she says 
one of the inmates 28yearold abraham friesen only days away 
from his scheduled release after 18 months imprisonment said he 
planned to emigrate with his wife and six children 
id like to go to another country maybe canada he said 
i had to sell everything theres nothing left for me here

authority 
the nobels members of an independent reformed church consider 
public schools to be unchristian places that do a mediocre job of 
educating they also find a nearby christian school unacceptable 
because of doctrinal differences 
they are among an estimated 750000 to 1 million american 
families teaching their kids at home says chris klicka senior 
counsel for the home school legal defense association in paeoian 
springs va the association offers legal assistance to 
homeschoolers for a 100 annual fee 
many cite religious reasons for keeping their children out of 
public schools and some end up in court says klicka whose group 
is involved in more than 30 cases nationwide protesting state 
restrictions on homeschoolers 
were gaining ground he says thirtyone states have 
passed bills permitting schooling at home and 29 have done so 
since 1982 
michigan and iowa remain the most restrictive states with laws 
requiring certified teachers klicka says homeschoolers also 
object to laws in other states that require such things as teacher 
competency tests or college degrees 
michigans law is being challenged in a case pending before the 
michigan supreme court and has been altered by previous court 
decisions 
jean shane education consultant for the michigan department of 
education says recent court decisions require the state to give 
teaching permits to people with bachelors degrees even if they 
lack teaching certificates 
parents who ask for a permit must report the names of the 
children being taught and the curriculum being used shane says 
about 700 filed reports this year but klicka says many never 
report for fear of being taken to court 
mrs nobel a college graduate who won a court ruling allowing 
her to teach at home began teaching her children more than 11 
years ago with 22yearold abigail and now with 3yearold hannah 
the nobel children begin their day with chores on the familys 
77acre dairy farm about 25 miles south of grand rapids then they 
gather in the living room at 9 am for hymns while charity 17 
accompanies them on the piano 
the children grab their books and scatter to their separate 
study areas on the floors of their bedrooms at the diningroom 
table or in the kitchen 
unless i have a problem i dont even go downstairs i just 
work by myself in a way thats better says charity who does 
her schoolwork sitting crosslegged on the floor of her tidy 
bedroom 
economics history biology government algebra english 
literature typing and bible fill about five hours of her day the 
younger children spend about three hours a day on their studies 
downstairs mrs nobel spends a few minutes with each child 
hope at the dining room table recites for her mother a portion 
of the midnight ride of paul revere that the 11yearold 
sixthgrader has memorized then she takes a science test 
luke 14 has read a story at a small desk at the end of his bed 
and mrs nobel quizzes him about it 
then the older children work independently while mrs nobel 
helps samuel a 7yearold firstgrader sitting at a small desk in 
the kitchen read a story about jesus walking on water 
i think that they get the basics says mrs nobel who has 
found herself brushing up on algebra and chemistry to stay ahead of 
her students 
some of the childrens books and worksheets come from the 
christian liberty academy in arlington heights ill a private 
school that also operates a correspondence school for parents who 
teach their children at home 
the children follow a school year similar to a traditional 
school they get report cards four times a year and take 
standardized achievement tests used by many traditional schools 
on a recent round of tests their scores were at or above grade 
level in all areas 
they arent being compared with other children their age 
says mrs nobel who has taught as many as seven children at once 
they move at their pace and arent really that much aware that 
they are behind or ahead of others 
one daughter is attending calvin college in grand rapids and 
another graduated as a registered nurse mrs nobel says they were 
as well prepared as their classmates 
there were a few things they had to catch up on such as 
science laboratory work but it was by no means impossible she 
says 
the childrens studies are supplemented by trips to the library 
occasional field trips with other homeschooling families softball 
games and volleyball matches 
mrs nobel who taught briefly in a christian school says a 
teaching certificate is no guarantee of a teachers ability 
but mary anne adams consultant in the michigan education 
associations professional development department says teachers 
without certificates may lack knowledge of how children learn and 
what should be taught 
children taught entirely at home also may lag in social 
development because they have fewer opportunities to mix with 
others their own age adams says 
that whole socialization process is important

when roberto athayde wrote the play miss 
margaridas way in brazil 19 years ago it was forbidden to 
criticize government figures so he wrote about a schoolteacher 
athayde says audiences immediately identified his schoolteacher 
as the general who was then brazils dictator 
now dictators are falling but the author says the message of 
miss margaridas way is that they can also rise and people 
allow it to happen 
estelle parsons who is back in the role of miss margarida for 
its current revival on broadway agrees 
roberto said when he wrote it he wanted to show miss margarida 
had a tremendous amount of appeal people have to love dictators 
and perpetuate them and keep them going people are always saying 
how could this happen i thought this is how it happens 
onstage at the helen hayes theater parsons as miss margarida 
berates her eighthgrade class the audience if somebody comes in 
late she demands that they come to the stage and apologize they 
do 
she postures seduces fascinates she demands obedience 
punishes offenders and rants insanely theres no army backing her 
up but shes in control 
parsons who likes substance in the work she does first played 
miss margarida at the offbroadway public theater and then on 
broadway in 1977 since then she has played the role across the 
united states and in england ireland australia and turkey 
the revival on broadway opened on feb 15 for a sixweek run 
it is really a classic she says it always works 
parsons whose college degree is in political science began her 
show business career here as a singer in such vehicles as julius 
monks revues at the upstairs at the downstairs she began acting 
in a search for substance 
the change in the audience response to miss margarida since 
1977 troubles parsons 
it is scary to me that people are more passive now more 
willing to take it she says i had someone come up and confess 
to something i stood him in the corner facing the wall wearing a 
dunce cap and he missed the whole second act thats the first 
time anyone has done that theyve fidgeted around the cap has 
fallen off and theyve gone back to their seat 
theres a part where i say everybody has to sing they always 
sing they never used to sing before they do what i tell them 
thats rather frightening isnt it were heading toward 
addlebrained leaders machines talking to us people wanting to be 
led our confidence as individuals is getting less and less and 
less 
parsons won an academy award as best supporting actress as 
blanche in bonnie and clyde she plays tess truehearts mother 
in dick tracy coming out in june she currently plays roseanne 
barrs tv mother occasionally on roseanne 
she has no regrets about not pursuing a film or tv career i 
could never do that steadily she says its not profoundly 
interesting to me and i have no interest in money i dont have 
any material desires i love to have real crises for two hours 
where you get to entertain a group of people i have to have that 
mount everest to climb 
it doesnt matter how many times you walk out there on the 
stage every time it is a great adventure anything can happen 
next summer shell take miss margarida back to turkey play 
lady macbeth in florida and gypsy in hawaii 
parsons has twin daughters from her first marriage martha 
gehman an actress and abbie britton a freelance writer 
she and her second husband lawyer peter zimroth are adoptive 
parents of abraham whos in the first grade 
i really love taking care of my family the actress says 
im really split i also love to work in february i had to give 
up taking abraham skiing its really hard everybody who works has 
that problem

citing national interest humanitarian causes and 
business competition western democracies are slowly dismantling 
the sanctions they imposed on china after the bloody suppression of 
the democracy movement last spring 
western officials are coming back to renew contacts with chinese 
counterparts but tourists and businessmen still apparently wary 
havent returned in the numbers they came in before 
the west remains committed in principle to limits on 
highlevel visits arms sales and new aid packages but with the 
beginning of the year exceptions have become the rule and some 
sanctions never strong to start with are withering away even 
though repression continues 
the turning point was the surprise visit in december by us 
national security adviser brent scowcroft and disclosures that he 
had made a previous visit in july just a month after the army 
killed hundreds perhaps thousands in snuffing out the 
prodemocracy movement 
president bush was assailed in congress for his overtures to the 
hardline beijing government but other western nations quickly 
followed suit in easing bans on highlevel contacts 
but the tourists and businessmen who had poured into china after 
it opened up to the west a decade ago are staying home 
touristhotel occupancy rates are only about half what they were 
a year ago and the china market seems to have lost its luster for 
businessmen as the government reasserts central controls and puts 
off new marketoriented reforms 
businessmen were the first to argue we really ought to get 
back in said an australian diplomat now they are some of the 
most reluctant to come back 
john frisbie of the uschina business council said there is 
little direct correlation between sanctions and business but the 
direction of chinese policy was positive before now businessmen 
are uncertain and will be for some time 
the renewed contacts are chiefly governmental 
the european economic community decided in midjanuary that 
political visits short of the ministerial level were acceptable 
australia said on jan 23 that visits by cabinet ministers would be 
allowed on a casebycase basis 
in january japan played host to the head of chinas state 
planning commission and britain disclosed that sir percy cradock 
senior foreign policy adviser to prime minister margaret thatcher 
held secret talks in beijing in december 
more crucial to china has been the lifting of bans on credit and 
aid in december the eec gave its 12 member nations the goahead to 
extend export credits to china and spain responded by announcing a 
30 million development loan in early january 
on feb 2 the us exportimport bank signed a 975 million 
loan with a chinese oil corporation a week later the bank 
announced a 104 million grant part of a 231 million package to 
encourage china to buy american equipment for a shanghai subway 
project 
the bank said contracts won by american companies would have 
been jeopardized if financing had not been finalized west germany 
has provided 275 million in preferential credit for the subway 
project 
only a few private syndicated loans have been made since june 
but as one west german diplomat said everyone is waiting for 
the world bank 
the chinese are almost passionate about world bank loans 
said one us official he said chinese officials constantly bring 
up the 780 million in world bank concessionary credit suspended 
since june and blame the united states for it 
they say if the world bank loans do not come through we 
will retaliate against you the official said 
on feb 8 the world bank following a white house decision to 
back loans for human needs approved a loan package of 30 
million to aid an earthquakestruck area of northern china 
the ban with 151 nations as members is still withholding the 
big development loan package but a positive decision could open 
the floodgates particularly from chinas main creditor japan 
japan continues to discourage commercial lending but has also 
given the goahead to human need loans and has started talks on 
a fiveyear 56 billion package of development aid 
other signs of encroaching normalcy in relations are showing up 
a 600 million us project to develop avionic equipment for 
chinese fighter planes is on course chinese engineers were allowed 
to return to their jobs at us plants in october 
a vote by the us congress in late january to codify sanctions 
drew howls of protest from china but congress allowed bush to 
waive sanctions if it was in the national interest a right he 
exercised in approving the export of three usmade satellites to 
be launched by chinese rockets 
the us department of agriculture recently announced china was 
authorized to buy an additional 1 million metric tons of wheat at 
subsidized prices and uschina trade in general expanded by 
nearly 40 percent in 1989 over 1988 
talks are under way to resume the fulbright program the peace 
corps unable to send its first volunteers last year hopes to 
start its program this year 
canada announced in january its first new cultural project since 
last year a community college exchange program 
bush and other western leaders have argued that the chinese 
people should not suffer from sanctions and that its bad policy to 
isolate the chinese government so far however china has done 
little to reciprocate the wests conciliatory gestures 
the government in moves mainly intended to improve its 
international image and obtain badly needed foreign credit lifted 
martial law in beijing in january and announced the release of 573 
participants in the prodemocracy movement 
but political repression continues with dissent outlawed and 
thousands of activists languishing in jails without being formally 
tried and forbidden to see families and lawyers 
government leaders continue to say chinas economic reforms and 
open door policy go on yet the communist party is reasserting 
controls over industry and the propaganda line is that western 
technology is fine but western values must be repudiated 
as a consequence its hardly business as usual with china 
foreign minister gareth evans of australia has said his countrys 
continued ban on new aid projects and concessional lending 
reflects the reality that unhappily nothing much has changed 
since last june 
japans foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe concurred 
we are ready to cooperate as soon as possible in the direction of 
the modernization of china but the developments under which we can 
conduct normal relations have yet to arrive 
tourism a major source of foreign exchange for china has 
picked up only slightly occupancy rates at beijings main foreign 
tourist hotels averaged around 30 percent in january compared to 
nearly 60 percent a year earlier 
no major new joint venture projects have been put together since 
june chinas trade ministry said foreign loans implemented in 1989 
were down 51 percent from the previous year to 48 billion and 
technology import contracts were off 25 percent 
asked about the prospects for a quick return to normal business 
transactions liu xiangdong spokesman for the ministry of foreign 
economic relations and trade said we do not have any 
unrealistic fantasies

the helicopter appears as a pinlight on the 
northern horizon the brightest star in a dark blue sky 
coming closer it shoots a wide beam of light over the rooftop 
at jackson memorial hospital and settles down with a shuddering 
blast of tropical air two men inside have been shot twice each 
with 9mm bullets and one is dying 
dr jeff vaughan waiting on the landing pad turns to a nurse 
youre going to see blood now sister he says 
but spilled blood is routine at jackson memorials trauma 
center already this evening the trauma crew has treated a woman 
shot by her boyfriend a man dumped 30 feet off a scaffold a 
10yearold bicyclist hit by a car and a prison inmate stabbed with 
a homemade knife 
that roster accounts for every serious injury suffered in the 
miami metropolitan area in the preceding six hours if youre badly 
hurt in dade county these days the only place to go is jackson 
memorial 
that distinction puts jackson a publicly financed teaching 
hospital at the forefront of a dismal national trend it is one of 
a shrinking number of big city hospitals offering special care for 
trauma the medical name given to lifethreatening injuries 
in los angeles chicago philadelphia and elsewhere private 
hospitals have been shutting down trauma units most of which 
opened in the mid1980s the specialtys boom years 
the resulting squeeze threatens not only quality of health care 
but also the financial stability of the hospitals left carrying the 
load 
gunfights car crashes the occasional industrial accident 
these are the lifeblood of trauma care centers the american 
college of surgeons estimates that 250 to 350 trauma centers 
operate around the country ranging from such giants as new yorks 
bellevue hospital and miamis jackson memorial to the nt enloe 
hospital in chico calif and easton hospital in easton pa 
trauma units are usually affiliated with but distinct from 
ordinary emergency rooms ers handle broken legs concussions 
poisonings the lesser varieties of mayhem trauma units take over 
in more serious cases of multiple injuries when lives are on the 
line 
trauma centers are staffed by surgeons and major trauma 
hospitals keep full staffs of specialists on duty around the clock 
if you need a neurosurgeon at 3 am jackson memorial will have 
one 
in rural and suburban areas trauma is almost always the result 
of auto accidents and the drivers are usually insured in these 
areas trauma centers pay their way even make profits 
but in inner cities patients increasingly are members of what 
doctors caustically refer to as the knife and gun club club 
members have a couple of things in common they are almost always 
involved in drugs they are almost never insured 
at jackson memorial which handles 6000 trauma cases a year 
about onethird of the patients are admitted for penetrating 
trauma knife or bullet wounds about onethird of the patients 
are uninsured 
these are expensive injuries and blunt trauma injuries 
suffered in car crashes can be even costlier its not unusual for 
traumacare bills to mount into the tens or even hundreds of 
thousands of dollars 
even with the paying patient trauma is going to cost more 
than the average treatment more than what insurance will probably 
pay said jeanne eckes a registered nurse who coordinates 
jacksons trauma service 
jackson estimates the trauma unit will lose at least 12 
million this next fiscal year in addition to direct losses the 
hospital loses money when trauma patients bump regular patients 
out of operating rooms and intensive care beds that happens nearly 
every day 
of four patients admitted to jacksons trauma center so far this 
evening three have been sent to the operating room or intensive 
care the lone exception is the luckless prison inmate whos been 
treated for his stab wounds and sent back to jail 
it is already a grueling evening filled with splitsecond 
lifeordeath decisions even the janitor is busy mopping up blood 
from the trauma room floor 
on a break in the action vaughan and another doctor alan 
rosenberg wolf down dinner in the cafeteria they are there when 
air rescue calls about 10 pm 
two men with gunshot wounds had shown up at a hospital eight 
miles away they couldnt be treated there the hospital doesnt 
handle trauma they are being flown to jackson 
on the elevator to the roof rosenberg and vaughan turn goofy 
with excitement they stretch out on the two gurneys and joke and 
slap five they dont get serious until the helicopter is down and 
then with the blades still blurring overhead they get serious in 
a hurry 
vaughan is first into the elevator with the more seriously 
wounded man before the doors shut he is frantically at work 
hes not moving any air man he says his voice tight with 
tension he shoves a tube down the mans nose and squeezes a 
bulbous green bag a hole in the patients chest gurgles with blood 
when the elevator reaches the ground floor vaughan runs with 
the gurney to the trauma room his patient is slipping away 
patients like this are flown to jackson every day the hospital 
tallies more than 1000 helicopter landings a year in what some 
doctors say is a legacy of the vietnam war the airborne rescue 
some people say the entire modern system of trauma care grew out 
of the militarys medical experience in vietnam others say it 
evolved in large urban hospitals in the 1960s 
trauma care grew rapidly after research in the late 1970s proved 
trauma centers routinely saved lives that would be lost with 
ordinary emergency care 
by the early to mid1980s trauma had become hot business in 
search of prestige and profits hospitals jumped at the opportunity 
to treat trauma victims despite the expense of maintaining a 
24hour staff of surgical specialists 
some cities established trauma networks to ensure patients were 
sent to the closest trauma hospital miamis network established 
in 1985 ultimately consisted of six private hospitals and the 
public jackson memorial 
b boyd benjamin the blunttalking gravelvoiced chairman of 
the board of the dade county public health trust recalls what 
happened then 
it was wonderful he said big committees met everything 
was fine and the first thing that happened i guess was some poor 
sonofabitch got run over and didnt have a penny and he ends up at 
one of these forprofit hospitals and they want to ask wheres 
your insurance i dont have any insurance they found out 
very quickly that this was going to be a loser 
in the space of six months in 1987 all six private hospitals 
dropped out of the network leaving jackson the only metropolitan 
area hospital willing to accept adult trauma patients miami 
childrens hospital accepts injured children 
a similar winnowing process has taken place in other big cities 
as hospitals discover their expected profits are elusive 
they see it as fiscally irresponsible said dr gerald o 
strauch director of the trauma department at the american college 
of surgeons in chicago we all know that hospitals have become 
big business and theyre managed like a big business

in los angeles county a regional trauma network with 23 
hospitals has shrunk to 13 chicago had 10 adult trauma hospitals 
two years ago the loss of another hospital this month will reduce 
the number to six 
houston is down to just one level i trauma center capable of 
handling the most serious cases one of philadelphias major trauma 
centers temple university hospital recently announced it was 
leaving a regional trauma system 
the hospitals that remain are increasingly overwhelmed their 
trauma centers resembling nothing so much as military mash units in 
the heat of battle indeed the military sends its physicians to 
inner city trauma centers to prepare them for combat 
the consolidation of trauma care raises some daunting questions 
what happens to the patient whos in a serious auto accident and 
has to be taken 25 miles to a hospital instead of five worse what 
happens when a plane crashes 
its gotten to the point where no matter who you are if 
youre injured in a city your chances of getting to a trauma 
center that has everything it needs are getting slimmer said dr 
jeff augenstein one of the attending surgeons in charge at jackson 
jacksons administrators believe theyve found a solution 
having accepted their hospitals role as the citys only 
traumacare center they intend to capitalize on it they are now 
trying to raise 25 million for what benjamin the public health 
trusts board chairman calls a state of the art world class 
selfcontained freestanding shocktrauma center 
the idea is to get trauma patients out of the main hospital 
leaving more room there for regular paying patients our 
projections show that we will at least break even benjamin said 
hospital officials hope the new center will become a magnet for 
research dollars and talented staff in the meantime doctors at 
jackson insist they can handle anything that comes their way 
it is 1014 pm when jeff vaughan wheels the gurney into the 
trauma room half a dozen people jump to action one slips an 
oxygen mask over the patients face another takes blood vaughan 
examines the body it is young and strong and has bullet holes in 
the chest and shoulder two police officers stand to the side 
watching 
wheres xray vaughan hollers cmon hector lets get a 
quick film 
at 1018 vaughan inserts a tube nearly the width of a garden 
hose into the left side of the mans chest it begins pumping 
hemorrhaging blood out of the chest cavity and into intravenous 
tubes for transfusion vaughans rubber gloves and gown are covered 
with blood red dots shine on his eyeglass lenses 
whats his pressure someone shouts 
very very low vaughan yells back hes got serious 
problems in his chest 
he goes to the other side and inserts another tube weve got 
blood on this side too guys and lots of it 
within minutes the crisis ebbs the patients systolic blood 
pressure about 50 when he entered the trauma room is up to 110 
his pulse is strong he breathes with the aid of the oxygen mask 
the gurney is pushed out the door and up to the operating room 
hes a long way from being ok but hes got a chance 
vaughan says 
bloody footprints mark the path down the hall 
it has been a remarkable display of grace under pressure but it 
isnt enough this time the patient dies 10 minutes into surgery 
his buddy survives and not for the first time medical records 
show hes been treated at jackson before for gunshot wounds six 
times 
hey man you gonna get some frequent flier miles if you keep 
coming in here vaughan tells him 
police say the two men claimed to have been attacked on the 
street for no reason the cops tone suggests disbelief 
vaughan drifts into an employee lounge for a dr pepper and a 
smoke he is about 18 hours into a 24hour shift and it is 
beginning to show he speaks bitterly about the strains of the job 
and patients who would just as soon kill us as look at us 
its a war zone he says and its like this in every 
major city

alaska is a young frontier state where 
oldtimers still are called pioneers and being a pioneer has its 
benefits 
the state runs six bargainrate retirement homes pays residents 
65 and older 250 a month regardless of need provides them a 
propertytax exemption or rent rebate and issues free hunting and 
fishing licenses 
there also are local salestax exemptions free university 
tuition and free transportation on state ferries 
compared to other states alaska is generous to its elderly but 
that may not last the decade 
they are exacting a growing cost as alaskas population ages 
and a severe drop in oil revenues expected this decade already has 
led to changes in the most expensive programs 
the residency requirement for the 250amonth longevity 
bonus was increased from one to two years jan 1 and the 
legislature is considering phasing out the program over the next 
two decades and rates at the states pioneers homes were 
increased by as much as 52 percent recently 
after planning their retirement around the programs many older 
residents fear they may be left out in the street in their 
final years said barbara bathony director of the state pioneers 
benefits division 
it is traumatic for a person in their later years to have to 
think what is going to happen to me said joe alter of juneau 
a 74yearold retired civil engineer who moved to alaska 46 years 
ago when nobody thought of retiring here 
changes are inevitable said rep red boucher of anchorage who 
is 69 if changes are made carefully and over time he said senior 
citizens will adjust 
we treat them as good as any other state in the union if not 
better he said i think thats good we just have to achieve a 
balance in it i dont know of a single alaskan who wouldnt agree 
with that 
alaska began caring for its older residents long before it 
became a state in 1959 the first pioneers home opened in sitka in 
1913 
this year the state expects to spend more than 25 million to 
run the homes for about 540 residents 
more than double that amount is spent on the unique longevity 
bonus program created in 1972 to reward people who had helped 
settle the alaska territory at first it provided 100 a month to 
alaskans 65 and older who had lived in the state continuously for 
at least 25 years 
it started out as a great idea for those people who came here 
in hard times and made many sacrifices boucher said 
in 1984 however the alaska supreme court ruled the 25year 
residency rule unconstitutional the number of recipients and the 
programs cost increased sharply today more than 19000 alaskans 
claim the bonuses at a cost of about 62 million a year including 
administrative expenses 
proponents say that investment pays off economically and 
socially for many older alaskans the bonus helps them meet the 
states high cost of living 
theres a strong feeling that senior citizens want to become 
part of this society they dont want to be isolated alter said 
some of those benefits make it possible for these people to stay 
here economically otherwise theyd be going south 
when they leave they take their savings accounts their 
pensions and their retirement money out of state said connie 
sipe executive director of the state older alaskans commission 
the programs apparently have kept the elderly in alaska and 
brought in a few more the number of alaskans over 65 has grown at 
a rate faster than the overall population since 1970 according to 
the state labor department in 1988 those over 65 accounted for 38 
percent of alaskas population up from 23 percent in 1970 
we are having a little inmigration sipe said i dont 
think its because of the benefits i think its because of 
family 
even without transplants alaskas older population is expected 
to continue growing in the 1990s alaskans ages 5564 who soon 
will be signing up for longevity bonuses and beds in pioneers 
homes represent 54 percent of the population 
thats still a small percentage but they make up 15 to 20 
percent of the voting block making lawmakers reluctant to attack 
the programs publicly said rep terry martin of anchorage 
im not concerned because i dont think anythings going to 
happen right away said mellie terwilliger 80 an alaskan for 60 
years who lives with her husband in tok near their son and his 
family 
she said senior citizens have considerable political clout in 
juneau were very wellorganized 
martin favors basing the bonus on need a couple with a pair of 
pensions social security income and investments do not need an 
extra 500 a month from the state he said 
but sipe notes a 1984 study for the older alaskans commission 
which showed that half the longevity bonus recipients lived on 
10000 a year or less the study said 176 percent had incomes 
above 20000 
state sen jay kerttula a creator of the longevity bonus said 
it was not based on need because that would have made it seem like 
welfare lawmakers understood from their lifetime of experiences 
on the frontier what allowed a frontiersman to accept some type of 
assistance with some dignity kerttula said 
basing the bonus on need would require more bureaucracy and the 
increased costs would outweigh any savings said vera gazaway 
executive director of the nonprofit older persons action group 
inc in anchorage 
kerttula has proposed an annuity plan to replace state funding 
of the bonus an idea that has not yet become law 
state retirement homes also are becoming more costly 
pioneers homes are for those over 65 who have been continuous 
residents of alaska for at least 15 years however destitute 
alaskans get priority and do not have to meet the age limit 
onesixth of those in the homes at the end of 1989 were considered 
destitute 
the greatest demand is for beds in the nursingcare units where 
the wait can run to five years the rates up to 800 a month for 
nursing care compare with private nursing homes that charge more 
than 5000 a month 
the six homes are a major part of the elderly healthcare system 
in alaska there are no profitmaking nursing homes and only 12 
private nonprofit facilities all but one with fewer than 100 
beds 
the pioneers homes charge only those who can afford to pay and 
because of the restrictive residency requirements the homes do not 
get federal medicaid money bathony said that while costs have 
continued to rise the legislature has not increased the homes 
budget since 1986 
alaska needs a system for home care as an alternative to nursing 
homes sipe said legislation is pending that would allow the state 
to use medicaid money for home care 
were quite behind other states she said were in the 
bottom third in terms of homecare options for seniors

it used to take the old ira man an hour to cross 
the room at a noraid fundraiser besieged as he was by people who 
wanted to shake his hand kiss his cheek or snap his picture 
this theyd tell their children is michael flannery the 
teenage soldier who fought the british in irelands war of 
independence the young man who moved to america but never forgot 
ireland the old man who founded irish northern aid to support the 
irish republican armys battle against british rule in northern 
ireland 
but when noraid held its annual dinner last month for the first 
time in 18 years michael flannery stayed home 
at 88 most people are inclined to ease off accepting easy 
acclaim and benign deference not flannery he has denounced the 
leaders of noraid and of sinn fein the iras political party for 
placing too much faith in politics and not enough in military force 
it grieved me to leave noraid because i was its founder he 
says in his squeaky brogue but it was the only thing my 
conscience would allow me to do 
for threequarters of a century flannerys conscience 
repeatedly has forced him to choose principle over expediency and 
to fight other irishmen over how to best fight the british 
on a recent morning flannery greeted a reporter at the door of 
his queens home his step once brisk now inclined toward a 
shuffle and his back once ramrod stiff was slightly hunched he 
sat on a piano bench in the living room folded his long thin 
hands on his lap and talked for two hours straight 
he began not a month a year or a decade ago but on easter 
1916 when irish nationalists rose against british rule he was a 
lanky 14yearold from tipperary who volunteered to run messages 
for the rebels 
the angloirish conflict ended in 1921 with a treaty giving 26 
of irelands 32 counties virtual independence as the predominantly 
roman catholic irish free state based in dublin but the six 
mostly protestant northeastern counties remained part of the united 
kingdom and civil war ensued in the south between those for and 
against the partition 
flannery joined the antitreaty ira faction led by eamon de 
valera and was captured and imprisoned for two years he saw 
several of his comrades executed in reprisal for ira attacks and 
he took part in a 39day hunger strike he left prison as bitter at 
dublin as he was at london 
de valera however formed a new political party in 1926 and led 
his supporters into the dublin parliament flannery meanwhile had 
moved to america he watched in horror as de valera rose to power 
and crushed the ira which still fought for a unified irish 
republic 
within four years de valera was arresting ira men flannery 
said four years after that he was executing them 
flannery settled in the new york city borough of queens with his 
wife got a job with an insurance company and joined irish athletic 
and cultural groups and he raised money for the ira 
the american irish lost interest in irelands intramural 
squabbles but flannery never gave up he claimed to have visited 
every saloon in new york city looking for donations even though he 
was a teetotaler a remnant of military discipline 
when a rising tide of violence against catholics in northern 
ireland revived the ira in the late 1960s flannery was ready 
again he faced a choice the official ira which decided to 
seek power politically or the provisional ira which took up 
arms in the north 
flannery threw in with the provos with a few other vets he 
founded noraid 
flannery insisted that the millions noraid collected went to the 
families of dead or imprisoned ira soldiers but in 1981 he was 
arrested on his way out of church and accused of banking an 
operation to smuggle guns to the ira 
at the trial flannery delivered his own opening statement we 
are indicted here for the love of freedom he said and the 
love of freedom alone 
even those opposed to the ira whose attacks often killed or 
maimed civilians were moved by such a durable passion although 
flannery and his codefendants essentially admitted the 
accusations they were found innocent and the next year flannery 
was elected grand marshal of the new york st patricks day parade 
but americas guns money and prayers did not resolve northern 
irelands troubles and in 1986 sinn fein declared itself willing 
to take seats in the dublin parliament a body from which militant 
nationalists had abstained since the islands partition to 
flannery this was official recognition of the government that had 
imprisoned him killed his comrades and sold out the north 
the ira sided with sinn fein as did most of noraids younger 
members flannery did not press the issue he continued to attend 
some noraid functions and noraid continued to use his name 
but last year a rift developed in noraid and flannery joined 
dissidents in accusing the organizations leaders of steering it 
toward politics and away from its original humanitarian 
objectives 
shortly thereafter he stood before noraids executive committee 
in a wedding hall in queens and accused sinn feins leaders of 
being free staters whose devotion to politics would soommunist party 
chief milos jakes 
the countrys first parliamentary elections in more than four 
decades are planned for june 8 
havel 53 who has said he is more interested in being a writer 
than president is popular among his countrymen and has not 
announced whether he will seek election in june 
havels government has insisted the soviet union withdraw its 
73500 troops as quickly as possible and favors eventual 
dissolution of the warsaw pact some czechoslovakian officials also 
have urged that nato be phased out something the bush 
administration strongly opposes

companies with international operations may find 
it easier to set up a worldwide telephone and datatransmission 
network using a new digital phone service offered by atampt 
the phone company on monday demonstrated potential uses for the 
service which links the united states with japan and great britain 
using an international transmission standard a number of other 
nations are expected to be added to the network by the end of the 
year 
the service can be dialed up like a regular phone call once a 
special digital line is installed to the customer american 
telephone amp telegraph co said 
unlike conventional analog phone lines digital lines enable the 
transmission of computer data and video conferences they also 
provide distortionfree phone calls and far faster fax 
transmissions overseas 
atampt began offering dialup digital lines to other nations in 
1988 but these lines are based on a north american standard which 
transmits data at 56 kilobits per second most of the rest of the 
world uses digital lines that transmit data at 64 kilobits per 
second 
a kilobit is 1000 bits a bit is the smallest piece of 
information used by a computer and represents either the digit 1 
or 0 
the difference in standards has meant us customers must use an 
adaptor to send computerbased information abroad which creates 
the possiblity that errors could be introduced in the transmission 
said atampt spokesman rick wallerstein 
with the new service which was announced last month a us 
company could set up a phone and datatransmission network around 
the world based on the 64kilobit standard 
before the dialup digital services were available the only way 
for a company to send computer data overseas was through a leased 
private line these dedicated lines are more expensive in 
general than the dialup services which are billed per minute of 
use like conventional phone lines 
the new switched digital international service was approved feb 
5 by the federal communications commission 
the service to japan is provided in cooperation with nippon 
telegraph and telephone corp and overseas communications japan 
while the british service is a venture with british telecom plc 
at a news conference monday atampt demonstrated a video 
conference hookup with tokyo using two of the new phone lines 
simultaneously because video transmissions contain a huge amount 
of data their quality is improved by sending it over two lines at 
once 
but the picture quality still is lower than what is provided by 
normal television broadcasts the image is grainy and the motion is 
delayed giving the impression that the video is being shown in 
slow motion 
the equipment used for the video conference is made by 
picturetel corp of peabody mass which has a marketing agreement 
with atampt 
atampt also demonstrated a personal computer linkup through the 
phone lines when changes were made on a computer screen in new 
york they could be seen on a similar computer screen in tokyo by 
watching the tv monitor used for the video conference 
in addition atampt demonstrated a digital telephone which 
provides far higher quality voice transmission than conventional 
phones and an optical scanner that allows the user to scan 
documents or objects electronically then send them over the phone 
lines abroad where they appear on a computer screen 
nippon telegraph and telephone also demonstrated computer and

the head of the governments savings 
and loan bailout board defended his agencys track record against 
criticism that it has been slow to act 
l william seidman chairman of the resolution trust corp as 
well as the federal deposit insurance corp on monday cited a 
barrage of statistics to demonstrate his agencys progress since 
its creation last year 
the rtc has taken over more than 350 thrifts in 37 states and 
advanced 114 billion to institutions to stem runs on deposits or 
replace highcost brokered deposits seidman told the american 
bankers associations national conference for community bankers 
in addition the rtc has listed for sale about a tenth of the 
300000 properties it took over from the failed thrifts seidman 
said 
seidman said he has hired a staff of almost 1900 people while 
in the process of merging his agency with the the federal savings 
and loan insurance corp a merger he described as a marriage 
that is about the equal of trump versus trump referring to the 
marital troubles of develop donald trump and his wife ivana 
he also said the agency has developed a strategic plan for how 
it will attack the sampl problem 
given the bureaucractic world we live in that alone is 
earthshaking he said 
seidman said the thrift bailout should be a boon to lawyers 
the rtc is handling more than 40000 lawsuits against failed 
thrifts and thats just the beginning he said we expect 
80000 by the end of the year and over onehalf billion dollars in 
outside legal fees on top of the expenses for about 1000 
government lawyers 
we are well under way to creating a shortage of lawyers in 
this country he quipped 
seidman spoke at the phoenecian resort the palatial luxury 
complex built by charles h keating jr keatings thrift lincoln 
savings and loan association of beverly hills calif and the 
resort were taken over by the government last year regulators say 
lincoln could become the most costly thrift bailout ever 
seidman joked that he wanted to put a stop to some rumors that 
were circulating at the bankers convention among them he said 
was that the phoenecian would be given away as a door prize 
on another topic seidman criticized the credit union industry 
saying it was expanding too quickly and overstating its financial 
strength 
credit unions seidman said have been claiming that their 
depositinsurance fund run by the national credit union 
administration is stronger than that of other institutions because 
credit unions keep 1 percent of the funds on deposit with the ncua 
but the practice is deceptive because the credit unions also book 
the money as assets seidman said 
credit unions are growing extremely quickly and are increasing 
their investments in areas where they have little experience he 
said theyve got a lot of the symptoms that the sampls had he 
said 
many critics of the thrift industry attribute the bulk of its 
problems to rapid growth and bad investments in projects outside 
its traditional breadandbutter areas such as housing loans

wendys international inc reported a 16 
percent drop in net income for the fourth quarter of 1989 but 
noted that earnings for the year increased 7 percent over 1988 
the restaurant chain also reported monday that systemwide sales 
topped 3 billion for the first time in company history 
wendys based in suburban columbus cited no specific reason 
for the drop in fourthquarter earnings president and chief 
executive officer james w near said the company ended the year 
with 55 fewer restaurants mostly because of sales to franchise 
owners 
for the fourth quarter that ended dec 31 1989 aftertax 
profit totaled 57 million or 6 cents a share on revenue of 
2611 million that compared with earnings of 68 million or 7 
cents a share on revenue of 2587 million in the same 1988 period 
profits for all of 1989 rose to 304 million or 32 cents a 
share from 285 million or 30 cents a share in 1988 revenue 
also were up from 106 billion in 1988 to 107 billion 
wendys said the results include a firstquarter accounting 
change for income taxes the change improved net income by 52 
million or 5 cents a share 
systemwide sales which include total sales from company and 
franchise restaurants were 740 million for the quarter up from 
711 million during the comparable period in 1988 for the year 
sales totaled 304 billion compared with 29 billion the 
previous year 
near said customer transactions which realized a 3 percent gain 
during the third quarter grew another 4 percent in the fourth 
quarter he said a new menu offering selected items at 99 cents 
each and an advertising campaign featuring wendys founder r david 
thomas were significant reasons for the jump in transactions 
im satisfied with our progress but i know we must make 
more dramatic improvements to gain market share in the 90s near 
said 
at years end there were 3755 wendys old fashioned hamburgers 
restaurants worldwide including 1118 operated by the company

chicago industrialist william f farley may be in 
financial trouble over his 58ashare hostile takeover of 
georgiabased west point pepperell inc last year 
farley faces a march deadline for his 103 billion bridge 
loan 
but the investment banking firm he was using to issue junk bonds 
drexel burnham lambert inc is going out of business after its 
parent company filed for bankruptcy protection and farley has been 
unable to sell any of west points major assets 
hes getting squeezed more and more said edward f johnson 
director of johnson redbook service a new york research firm 
its getting tougher the textile business is slowing plants he 
wanted to sell would bring less and he certainly wouldnt have 
paid as much for west point this year as he did 
last april farley paid 16 billion for 95 percent of west 
points shares and assumed about 1 billion in debt for the 
wellrespected georgia textile and apparel firm the purchase came 
after a bitter fight with former chairman and chief executive 
officer joseph l lanier jr whose family had run the company for 
years 
however farley must sell about 350 million in assets to 
receive an extension of his bridge loan through june and sales 
arent going well 
a jittery financial market has caused a lot of buyers to pull 
back out of the market said edgar davis executive vice 
president of west point money that would normally be available 
to financial investors is out of their reach right now for a lot of 
reasons 
drexels chapter 11 filing also hurts said richard byrne a 
junk bond analyst with merrill lynch 
west point is an excellent company unfortunately its highly 
leveraged he said adding that the companys paper in todays 
shaky junk bond market would be difficult to sell if not 
impossible 
last april west point issued 905 million in private placement 
of junk bonds a week before drexel filed for bankruptcy two of 
the leading bond rating agencies lowered their ratings of farley 
inc west pointpepperell and some subsidiaries 
last year farley announced it had reached an agreement to sell 
the hosiery shirt and tailored apparel divisions of cluett peabody 
amp company inc to a parisbased company for 600 million lower 
than the 700 million farley sought 
the deal was to have closed last november but reports in the 
trade press say the price has now dropped to 430 million and that 
one of the major banks backing the buyer bidermann group has 
backed out a spokesman for bidermann industries usa inc declined 
to comment on whether price has been a factor the deal is now 
expected to close next month 
farley has made some nutsandbolts changes at west point he 
hired charles a lieppe who had worked 21 years with procter amp 
gamble co as president and chief operating officer 
and davis said farley intends to concentrate on the companys 
strong core business of bed and bath products 
the company has added 800 people at five plants making the 
products and davis said another 100 jobs may be added during the 
first six months of 1990 farley also has invested between 80 
million and 90 million in equipment and physical improvements to 
make the bed and bath plants more efficient

frozen sandwich line 
knowlton told securities analysts monday in fort lauderdale 
fla that the austinbased company aims to grow mainly through 
internal expansion and new products but also is searching for 
acquisitions

co fell apart last year 
lacey logan a spokeswoman for stroh declined to comment stroh 
is the nations thirdlargest brewer behind anheuserbusch inc and 
miller brewing co coors and heileman follow 
stroh executives were examining a threeway deal that would have

winstonsalem nc ap rj reynolds tobacco co might find 
itself embroiled in another battle over the test marketing of a 
cigarette a leading womens advocate says 
after a national firestorm of criticism a month ago reynolds 
shelved plans to market in philadelphia a new menthol brand called 
uptown a cigarette the company said was targeted for black smokers 
now the company plans to testmarket a cigarette called dakota 
in houston in april according to news accounts a marketing plan 
designed for the cigarette would gear a publicity campaign toward 
young women with a high school education or less 
rj reynolds a division of rjr nabisco inc says it has not 
seen the marketing plan 
molly yard president of the national organization for women 
said monday from washington in an interview with the greensboro 
news amp record that she will encourage womens groups in houston to 
organize and combat dakota as black groups battled uptown in 
philadelphia 
i personally and im sure i speak for a huge majority of now 
members cannot understand how any selfrespecting company could 
seek to exploit so deliberately a group of young women who clearly 
because they are not collegebound probably never read any reports 
from the surgeon general on smoking she said 
they are deliberately leading them into a mode of life which 
will probably lead to their premature death 
a marketing plan said to have been leaked to the washington 
post the wall street journal and the magazine ad age said that 
dakotas chief goal is to capture the lucrative market among 18 to 
24yearold women with a high school education or less the only 
group of americans whose rate of smoking continues to increase 
but a spokeswoman for rj reynolds challenged the validity of 
the marketing plan maura payne said rj reynolds has not seen the 
plan which was developed under contract by an outside firm and 
does not know if it was fabricated or altered in any way 
she said the cigarette is designed to compete against marlboro 
anyone that is stealing documents and disseminating them is 
not above in my mind doing some altering of the documents as well 
to serve whatever agenda they seem to have ms payne said 
she said rj reynolds would stand by its new cigarette 
we will bring it to market and we will let the smokers the 
consumers decide if its a viable competitor for marlboro or 
not ms payne said 
marlboro made by rival philip morris is the worlds 
bestselling cigarette outselling reynolds winston brand by 
almost 21 philip morris is the worlds top cigarette maker and 
in recent years has increased its us market share over no 2 
reynolds 
in houston antismoking groups might mount a fight against 
dakota 
i very strongly feel there will be an opposition effort 
eleanor tinsley a houston city council member said monday this 
is a particularly vulnerable group of young women to pick a group 
of young women who have not received a great deal of education and 
then give them cigarettes is from my point of view 
reprehensible 
three years ago ms tinsley pushed through an ordinance that 
gave houston its first public smoking restrictions

represented charges for loans to lesser developed countries 
sharply higher than 49 million pounds or 84 million in such 
charges a year earlier

banks provisioning for loans to lesser developed countries which 
increased its coverage on problem sovereign loans to 75 percent 
from 36 percent in 1988 natwest has put the debt problem firmly 
behind us 
the bank also took an exceptional charge of 50 million pounds 
or 86 million in 1989 to cover legal fees and other potential 
costs associated with criminal charges stemming from its investment

some local school officials criticized the 
state board of education after it decided to sue over the use of a 
commercial television program and to expand its ban on the product 
the board voted monday to take the thomasville city school 
system to court because of its refusal to abide by the state 
boards ban on the use of channel one a 12minute commercial 
television program the board also decided to sue the programs 
producer whittle communications of knoxville tenn 
the state board had voted to ban channel one contracts signed 
after feb 1 but monday declared that all contracts for the news 
show were void even if they had been signed before the board 
outlawed it state officials said about 90 local schools had agreed 
to show the program 
some local school officials criticized the moves saying they 
infringed on the prerogatives of local boards 
the thomasville school board set up mondays confrontation on 
feb 8 by signing a contract for the program saying the state 
board had exceeded its authority by banning the show 
the issue speaks very directly to local control vs state 
control ronald b singletary the thomasville schools 
superintendent told the news and observer of raleigh 
its going to be very difficult for us to motivate teachers 
and administrators to seriously look at options that are considered 
nontraditional with this kind of presumption that if it hasnt 
been used then dont use it he said 
channel one offers a daily 12minute news program which 
includes two minutes of advertising the contract with whittle 
communications requires schools to show the program to all students 
each day in exchange the schools are loaned 50000 worth of 
video equipment for the length of the contract 
the suit also charges that the thomasville board exceeded its 
authority by signing the contract allowed students to be exploited 
for commercial purposes surrendered its control of classroom 
materials to whittle and violated state laws that guarantee the 
privacy of students 
the suit asks the court to bar thomasville and any other local 
school system from contracting or implementing a contract with 
whittle communications 
a statement from whittle communications said the company was 
studying the state boards action 
thomasville school officials did not return phone calls seeking 
reaction to the lawsuit 
whittle communications announced in new york last thursday it 
had signed up 2510 school nationally for channel one and had sold 
200 million in advertising the program is scheduled to debut

appalachian coal miners voted nearly 2to1 
to ratify their contract with pittston coal group union officials 
announced today the vote ends a bitter 10month strike that served 
as a rallying point for the american labor movement 
pittston employees in virginia west virginia and kentucky voted 
1247 to 734 in favor of the pact sixtythree percent of the 
striking miners and laidoff workers endorsed the contract and 37 
percent opposed it according to figures provided by the united 
mine workers 
the results were announced jointly in virginia and in bal 
harbor fla where the aflcio is holding its annual winter 
meeting umw president richard trumka aflcio president lane 
kirkland and us secretary of labor elizabeth dole joined in the 
florida announcement 
mrs dole appointed the super mediator former labor secretary 
william usery who helped forge the tentative settlement announced 
jan 1 
trumka called miners in castlewood va at about 915 am to 
tell them the strike was officially over kirkland and mrs dole 
joined in the call 
kirkland called the vote a happy conclusion to a long and very 
gallant struggle 
he told the miners your example and your steadfastness and 
your solidarity has been an inspiration to the entire trade union 
movement not just here but throughout the world its given us all 
a lift and i want you to know we share your victory 
mrs dole said it was a joyous day for the nation because the 
ratification was an example of the success of the collective 
bargaining process 
in virginia umw vice president cecil roberts told pittston coal 
group president michael odom of the results thats fantastic 
news odom said i think the both of us can agree weve got a 
worthy contract for employees the union and the company 
it could be a week to 10 days before miners return to work since 
mines must be reinspected and workers have to go through training 
courses union officials said 
of the 1310 miners voting in virginia 813 or 62 percent 
endorsed the contract while 497 workers or 38 percent opposed it 
of 479 workers voting in west virginia 339 or 71 percent 
favored the plan while 140 or 29 percent were against it 
the closest vote came in kentucky where 97 miners or 505 
percent opposed the plan while 95 workers or 495 percent 
supported it 
rufus hall 56 said miners were concerned about the scheduling 
flexibility in the new pact but about nine out of 10 members of 
his virginia local voted for it 
its a pretty good package except for the swing shift he 
said 
under the tentative agreement pittston would continue to pay 
100 percent of miners healthcare coverage rather than forcing 
them to take on 20 percent of those costs pittston also would 
continue paying into an industrywide pension fund from which it 
had withdrawn 
the company won the right to operate shifts around the clock and 
to suspend 13 strikers accused of illegal strike activity and force 
them to go to arbitration if they want to keep their jobs 
the strike drew widespread support from labor unions and 
religious leaders because of the use of peaceful civil disobedience 
primarily mass sitdown demonstrations to block coal trucks and 
because they believed pittston was trying to break the union a 
claim the company vigorously denied 
last october a delegation of international labor leaders 
including representatives of polands solidarity trade union 
attended a rally of pittston strikers in russell county soviet 
coal miners also toured the coalfields 
last summer the walkout touched off wildcat sympathy strikes at 
other coal companies that had settled with the umw at their peak 
those strikes affected tens of thousands of miners in much of the 
east and midwest 
the pittston strikes peaceful image was marred by sporadic 
violence aimed at company property supervisors and replacement 
workers russell county circuit judge donald mcglothlin cited the 
violence when he refused last week to drop 64 million in fines 
against the union for illegal strike activities 
trumka said when the settlement was announced that the union 
would withhold a rankandfile vote until all litigation related to 
the strike was dissolved but he announced thursday that the union 
was going ahead with the vote and the miners received copies of 
the proposed contract friday

the government will borrow 6 billion more 
than previously announced during the januarymarch quarter to meet 
the requirements of the savings and loan bailout the treasury 
department announced today 
treasury estimates that a total of 476 billion of market 
borrowing will be required for the januarymarch period including 
the 344 billion that had been issued or announced through friday 
feb 16 it said 
the treasury originally announced on jan 31 it would need to 
borrow 416 billion 
the additional funds will be obtained through regular auctions 
of weekly three and sixmonth bills and 52week bills the 
treasury said cash management bills also may be necessary to cover 
low points in the cash balance it said 
the revision takes into account the most uptodate estimate 
of the resolution funding corps requirements to borrow from the 
federal financing bank through march 31 it said 
the bank is a conduit for funneling treasury money to government 
agencies the resolution funding corp was created in the thrift 
bailout law as the financing arm of the resolution trust corp 
which actually disposes of the failed savings and loan institutions 
the bailout legislation provides 50 billion through next year 
to cover the losses in failed thrift institutions but the trust 
corporation needs to borrow as much as an additional 100 billion 
the borrowing called working capital would be repaid as 
the government sold loans real estate and other assets inherited 
from failed thrifts

the supreme court today refused to bar 
national banks from selling mortgages in the form of passthrough 
certificates a practice the securities industry says violates 
federal banking law 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that such sales 
are legal 
federal law allows national banks to sell the conventional real 
estate mortgages they hold but generally prohibits banks from 
underwriting buying and selling securities 
banks traditionally have sold longterm mortgages for other 
revenue sources and an increasingly popular means of selling 
mortages is the use of passthrough certificates which are 
securities 
the buyer of such a certificate obtains an interest in a pool of 
the banks conventional mortgages rather than a single mortgage 
the californiabased security pacific national bank began 
selling mortgage passthrough certificates in 1987 with a 194 
million public offering with the securities and exchange commission 
the securities industry association a group of more than 500 
organizations that account for over 90 percent of the nations 
securities brokerage and investment banking business asked federal 
regulators about the validity of passthrough certificates 
the comptroller of the currency concluded that security 
pacifics passthrough certificate program was authorized under 
the national banking laws which he said does not restrict the 
means by which national banks may sell or transfer interests in 
their mortgages 
the comptrollers decision was in keeping with the recent trend 
toward deregulation of the banking industry with the courts and 
federal regulators obliterating legal barriers between the banking 
industry and other forms of commerce 
after the comptrollers decision on security pacifics sales of 
passthrough certificates the securities industry association sued 
in federal court the suit sought to stop what the association 
asserted is the illegal sales of securities 
us district judge kevin duffy of new york city ruled in 1988 
that selling passthrough certificates amounted to underwriting 
securities in violation of a 1933 federal banking law the 
glasssteagall act 
but the 2nd us circuit court of appeals last sept 8 reversed 
duffys ruling and agreed with the comptroller of the currency 
the appeals court said such sales constitute the business of 
banking and not the business of dealing in securities and stock 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for the securities 
industry association said the effect of the 2nd circuit courts 
ruling is to write glasssteagall right out of the statute 
books 
in a friendofthecourt brief supporting the appeal 
lawyers for the investment company institute said the appeals court 
ruling has allowed the underwriting of mortgagebacked securities 
directly by national banks 
the decision simply demolishes the glasssteagall act they 
said 
the bush administration and lawyers for the security pacific 
national bank urged the court to reject the appeal 
the case is securities industry association vs clarke 89748

a new government report today estimated that 
smoking costs the nation more than 52 billion a year largely for 
health care expenses 
the report by the department of health and human services 
estimated smokingrelated disease averages 1 billion per state but 
said some states pay a much higher price than others 
california the most populous state has the highest costs 58 
billion the economic cost is lowest in alaska where it is 82 
million per year 
im especially concerned that we make more progress in 
reaching young people women minorities and bluecollar workers 
with accurate and compelling information about smoking and its 
devastating impact on their health hhs secretary louis sullivan 
said in a statement accompanying the report 
presenting the report at a hearing by the senate labor and human 
resources committee sullivan called on tobacco companies to stop 
targeting women minorities and young people 
sullivan in written testimony said that while americans have a 
personal responsibility to protect their health tobacco companies 
and smoking advertisers must also be responsible 
it is high time that we also stopped allowing smoking 
advertisers such a high hand he said a cigarette is the only 
legal product that when used as intended causes death 
advertisers who disproportionately target women minorities or 
young americans have gone too far they must stop their 
irresponsibility 
sullivan also said advertising agency and the media should 
question their involvement with tobacco companies he said he hoped 
to see them step forward to renounce tobacco ads and join in our 
antismoking efforts 
sullivan said the annual percapita costs of smokingrelated 
disease was 221 nationally he said that ranges from a low of 56 
a person in utah to 284 in rhode island 
the cost comes out of the pockets of smokers and nonsmokers

zenith electronics corp on tuesday said the sale 
of its computer division to a french company is in dispute 
the company also announced a 47 percent drop in fourthquarter 
profit from its consumer electronics business and a 17 million 
loss for the full year 
zenith the only major american manufacturer of color 
televisions reported results only for its consumer electronics and 
components business 
in a statement the suburban glenviewbased company said results 
for its zenith data systems computer business were not yet 
available because of a major dispute with the buyer groupe 
bull of france over the final sale price 
zenith said the sale which was announced in october was 
completed for 4964 million in late december but that groupe bull 
has since requested a refund of 49 million plus interest 
apparently due to a disagreement over the value of the divisions 
assets 
zenith reported net income from continuing operations of 4 
million or 15 cents per common share for the three months ended 
dec 31 compared with 75 million or 29 cents per share for the 
corresponding quarter a year earlier 
fourth quarter revenue from continuing operations rose slightly 
to 443 million from 440 million in 1988 
for the full year zenith reported a net loss from continuing 
operations of 17 million or 64 cents a share compared with a net 
loss of 11 million or 42 cents a share in 1988 
annual revenue from continuing operations rose 11 percent to 
15 billion from 14 billion in 1988 
zenith attributed the poor performance to higher material and 
labor costs which the company said offset the positive effects of 
higher sales volume and efficiency improvements

labor secretary elizabeth dole said 
today organized labor has an improved relationship with the bush 
administration despite the presidents refusal to let government 
intervene in the eastern airlines strike 
i think its clear that we have a positive relationship in 
that they believe the door is open that i want a continuing 
dialogue that the president does mrs dole said after meeting 
privately with aflcio leaders 
i understand that there are issues where well have to agree 
to disagree eastern is one of them all right so be it we have 
to agree to disagree there she said 
again defending president bushs veto of legislation that would 
have created a panel to resolve the eastern dispute mrs dole said 
there had been no favoritism toward management 
some union officials contend that bush unfairly sided with frank 
lorenzo head of texas air corp easterns parent company labor 
considers lorenzo a unionbuster who has refused to try to settle 
the strike through arbitration 
i feel mr lorenzos labor policies leave a lot to be 
desired mrs dole said 
the president was right to veto the legislation because 
transportation was not disrupted in any region of the country 
because of the strike she said 
why are we arguing about it i think its clear she said to 
reporters 
union officials say bushs attitude toward organized labor 
appears to be a marked improvement from the reagan era but they 
doubt theres been a substantive shift in policy 
the administration deserves credit for its involvement in the 
pittston coal strike mrs dole met with both sides and appointed 
a super mediator and for compromising on labors longsought 
hike in the minimum wage union leaders said 
but they also complain that bush while praising worker 
movements abroad such as solidarity in poland has demonstrated 
union busting tendencies at home with the eastern veto 
our president seems to be saying workers rights are fine in 
other parts of the world but not in my backyard said john 
sweeney president of the service employees international union 
the executive council of the 41 millionmember aflcio hopes to 
achieve improved relations with the bush administration as its 
33member board meets today with mrs dole 
i give bush and liz dole an aplus on pittston and a zero on 
eastern said joyce miller vice president of the amalgamated 
colthing and textile workes union 
many union officials considered ronald reagan who fired 
striking air traffic controllers in 1981 and effectively killed 
that union the worst president of the century for organized labor 
president bush and his kinder gentler nation at least talks 
about issues that affect workers like education child care and 
health care it took them long enough to come around on minimum 
wage so well see on the others sweeney said 
susan cowell vice president of the international ladies garment 
workers union said bush has been forced to improve the climate 
toward labor 
reagan created a revolution that was exposed as a fraud and 
the public tide has turned against it bush is almost forced to be 
more moderate that limits the degree to which he can hurt us 
cowell said 
bush is an odd character he doesnt embrace an ideology the 
way reagan does but its hard to see a policy difference she 
said 
last year bush agreed to address the aflcios convention in 
washington marking the first time a president had addressed the 
federation since jimmy carter did in 1979 reagan refused to speak 
in 1981 and was never invited again 
at the time aflcio president lane kirkland who a month 
earlier had called bush reagan lite said the presidents 
willingness to strike a compromise on minimum wage showed their had 
been some improvement over labors strained relationship with 
reagan 
on monday kirkland said union leaders would continue to lobby 
congress for an override of bushs veto of the eastern airlines 
legislation 
as expected the federations executive council skipped a vote 
on prochoice resolutions and instead appointed a 14member 
committee of union leaders to determine whether a stand should be 
taken 
kirkland said the panel would not be swayed much by a national 
right to life committee letterwriting campaign that urged union 
officials not to take a stand 
ive been around a while and i think i can tell grass roots 
from astroturf kirkland said insinuating the letters were not 
from rankandfile union members 
the letters warned union leaders that rankandfile members 
opposed to abortion would likely seek to have part of their union 
dues withheld if the aflcio which has sidestepped the issue for 
more than a decade adopted a prochoice position 
i do not think the committee will be moved by threats or 
suggestions of reprisals i think the committee will address the 
issues fairly and rationally and on the merits and will act 
accordingly kirkland said 
national right to life committee officials have said the aflcio 
should sit the issue out because it does not impact collective 
bargaining or workplace conditions 
prochoice union officials contend the issue impacts the 
economic wellbeing of working women they note the aflcio has 
traditionally taken a stand on a wide range of issues including 
civil rights gay rights and school busing 
i would say that the committee probably breaks down almost 
5050 said miller a prochoice member of the abortion panel 
she predicted the aflcio could adopt a prochoice position as long 
as it included language acknowledging the moral and religious views 
of some union members 
kirkland declined to identify his personal position the panels 
chairman william wynn president of the united food and commercial 
workers international union is prochoice but has said his 
personal feelings would not influence the committees decision 
kirkland did not give the panel a deadline but prochoice 
officials want a decision by the councils may meeting that would 
let labor leaders use the issue when making endorsements for the 
1990 elections

prices sharply lower on londons stock exchange 
tuesday pushed downward by weakness in the worlds bond markets 
and a big decline on wall street 
some bargain buying at early afternoon lifted prices to their 
best levels of the day however the rally could not be sustained 
dealers said especially after the sharp drop in the initial hours 
of wall street trading 
by the close of the european day the dow jones industrial 
average was off 4414 points at 259144 
market watchers said volume remained light which indicated a 
lack of outright selling and more of a drift lower 
the markets decline is due to more selling than buying but 
there hasnt been much of either one dealer said 
at the close the financial timesstock exchange 100stock index 
was down 201 points or 09 percent at 22770 just slightly 
above its lowest point for the day of 22764 and off from a

the quaker oats co has no 
immediate plans to sell its fisherprice toy company but has not 
ruled out a sale in the future the quaker chairman said 
william smithburg speaking at a meeting in fort lauderdale 
said quaker is working aggressively to turn around the depressed 
profits of the toy unit by fiscal 1991 
but he told a group of securities industry analysts here monday 
the company only will be marginally profitable in the second half 
of fiscal 1990 
fisherprices market share in younger childrens toys has 
dropped in the last year from 10 percent to the high 8 percent 
range said paul price quakers senior vice president of finance 
and new president of the division 
some analysts have predicted that the company could bring as 
much as 700 million to 800 million if the company were turned 
around 
we will examine all and i mean all options regarding 
fisherprice smithburg said 
that comment was a nod to analysts meeting here many of whom 
have said that quaker should get away from the volatile toy 
business 
quaker used to say no fisherprice is not for sale now at 
least they say they are thinking about it said john mcmillan an 
analyst for prudential bache securities 
as previously reported for the six months that ended dec 31 
fisherprice reported operating income of 19 million down 63 
percent from the same time a year before quaker blames production 
delays and a poor mix of toys 
but smithburg said fisherprice is still the leader in the 
preschool toy business and noted we are setting a pattern for a 
sizable turnaround in 1991 and into 1992

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said 
today the economy has likely passed the danger point for an 
imminent recession and he predicted continued although modest 
economic growth for the rest of this year 
greenspan said the central bank expects the economy to grow far 
more sluggishly this year than the bush administration predicts 
that scenario could dash the administrations hopes of making 
significant progress on reducing the federal budget deficit 
greenspan commented in an annual appearance before congress to 
reveal the banks allimportant monetary and economic growth 
targets for the new year 
the testimony bolstered the belief among many private economists 
that the federal reserve board is not likely to move soon to push 
interest rates lower 
following greenspans testimony prices tumbled in the stock and 
bond markets in midday trading that analysts said reflected 
investor worries about rising interest rates worldwide 
on wall street the dow jones industrial average of 30 stocks 
was down 4257 points to 259302 at 2 pm est in the credit 
markets the bellwether 30year treasury bond was off by about 
1250 per 1000 in face value with its yield rising to 863 
percent from 846 percent late friday 
greenspan emphasized a belief that the economy appears to be 
rebounding from an extremely sluggish octoberdecember period while 
at the same time inflationary pressures remain at unacceptable 
levels 
the fed chairman cited a string of recent economic reports 
showing a rebound in economic activity in january ranging from 
rising auto sales to a big jump in housing construction 
from these and similar data one can infer the beginnings of a 
modest firming in economic activity greenspan told a house 
banking subcommittee 
while we cannot be certain that we are as yet out of the 
recessionary woods such evidence warrants at least guarded 
optimism he said available indicators of nearterm 
economic performance suggest that the weakest point may have 
passed 
greenspans testimony served to reaffirm statements he made 
three weeks ago in another congressional appearance 
the feds economic forecast showed that the central bank is 
looking for the economy as measured by the gross national product 
to grow at an anemic rate of between 175 percent and 2 percent 
this year 
that is far below the administrations projection that the 
economy will grow by 26 percent this year when measured from the 
fourth quarter of 1989 
the administration is pinning its hopes of cutting the federal 
budget deficit in half on a belief that economic growth will 
rebound significantly in 1990 from the depressed level in the 
fourth quarter when the gnp rose at an annual rate of just 05 
percent its poorest showing in 3 years 
but if as appears likely the fed pursues a tighter credit 
policy to dampen inflationary pressures then interest rates will 
be higher than the administration is forecasting and growth will be 
slower two developments that will add billions of dollars to the 
budget deficit 
the feds economic forecast for 1990 represented only a modest 
change from a preliminary estimate the central bank made last june 
when it forecast growth of 15 percent to 2 percent 
however the fed substantially lowered its inflation estimate to 
4 percent to 45 percent for consumer prices down from a june 
forecast of 45 percent to 5 percent signaling perhaps a renewed 
emphasis on getting prices lower 
greenspan said that while consumer prices for january scheduled 
to be reported wednesday would show a sizable jump due to energy 
and food costs a reversal of this temporary spurt is apparently 
under way 
the ultimate objective of economic policy is to foster the 
maximum sustainable rate of economic growth greenspan said 
adding that inflation insidiously undermines business and 
consumer confidence in the economys future course 
greenspans testimony tracked the expectations of many 
economists who believe that the fed is succeeding in attempts to 
engineer a soft landing for the economy in which growth slows 
enough to dampen inflation but not enough to end the 7yearlong 
economic recovery 
but analysts said greenspans testimony sets the stage for a 
possible clash between the administrations optimistic economic 
goals and a fed intent on keeping a damper on growth to make sure 
that inflation does not get out of hand 
the public comments from the administration will be coming hot 
and heavy later on this year as bush officials try to nudge the fed 
into an easier stance predicted david jones chief economist of 
aubrey g lanston amp co a government securities dealer 
economists said a spurt in prices at the beginning of the year 
caused in large part by unusually cold weather which pushed up food 
costs also was working against lower interest rates 
the fed does not want to be perceived as easing at a time when 
inflation is accelerating even if those inflationary pressures 
were considered to be temporary jones said

the symbolic collapse of the berlin wall opened a 
door of opportunity that attracted a big flow of japanese 
investment to the west german stock exchange helping not only to 
fuel a market boom but also raising speculation of a big slump once 
the money dries up 
according to the securities dealers association of japan 
japanese investors increased the amount of their holdings of west 
german stocks to 944 million worth by the end of 1989 about 2 
times the amount of a year earlier 
the amount of japanese investments have been growing nowhere 
else but in west german stocks said kazumasa funaoka an 
association spokesman 
helping attract the investment is speculation that eastern bloc 
liberalization and weakening eastwest tensions will mean big 
moneymaking opportunities for west german companies in coming years 
relatively weak performances in other major stock markets also 
have made the frankfurt exchange look attractive 
the west german markets main indicator the 100issue faz 
index has soared some 20 percent in the last three months in 
contrast the tokyo stock exchanges 225issue nikkei stock average 
rose 5 percent and the new yorks 30issue dow jones industrial 
average rose only 15 percent 
five west german issues listed on the tokyo stock exchange 
commerzbank ag bayer ag deutsche bank ag dresdner bank ag and 
volkswagen also have posted strong gains 
kenji maeshiro an analyst with yamaichi securities co said 
the japanese investment boom in west german market is based on 
expectations of stability in the west german economy and growth of 
the frankfurt stock exchange 
japanese investors also are seeking a foothold ahead of the 
european communitys 1992 integration as well as access to the 
newly opening eastern bloc economies 
daiwa securities co is sending additional staffers from tokyo 
to its frankfurt subsidiary daiwa also has introduced a 
europeoriented fund for individual investors its second since 
november said daiwa spokesman yoshihiko azuma 
giant nomura securities also recently introduced its first 
german fund similar funds have been traded in the united 
states and europe 
stock investors increasing demand for the west german mark has 
strengthened the currency analysts said the mark which is 
trading at around 80 yen or 167 has gained 20 percent against 
those two currencies since november 
the investing power comes from japans abundant foreign exchange 
reserves the rising value of the yen and substantial capital 
savings 
maeshiro said the tokyo stock markets recent slowdown helped 
accelerate the german boom as investors moved to an arena with 
greater returns 
that in turn has made it more difficult to revive the tokyo 
market because market players are buying stocks in the west 
german market not here said one nomura dealer speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
as stock prices continue rising more on speculation than on 
economic fundamentals some analysts have been expressing concern 
that a massive inflow of japanese money may overheat the west 
german market which is only about onetenth the size of the tokyo 
market 
price increases under such conditions make the market 
vulnerable maeshiro said the markets uptrend can be easily 
reversed once negative news comes out 
but finance ministry spokesman yoshikazu sakai said japanese 
investment would not be so influential as to damage the frankfurt 
market the market will correct itself as more investors worry 
about the speed of price increases and start cashing in their 
gains sakai said 
we dont see japanese investment there as a possible cause of 
economic problems in japan and west germany he said 
but sakai said the boom could be temporary look at spain 
funds and southeast asian funds which investors used to be crazy 
about these funds no longer attract them he said who knows 
if west german funds are going to be like those

president bush welcomed czechoslovak president 
vaclav havel to the white house today promising trade rewards for 
pragues moves toward democracy and assuring him the united 
states will be part of your nations rebirth 
bush cautioned however that troops of the north atlantic 
treaty organization will continue to play vital role in assuring 
stability and security in europe and that america will 
continue to play its part including a strong military presence for 
our security and for europes 
some czechoslovak leaders have called for eventual dissolution 
of nato along with the warsaw pact the sovietled alliance to 
which czechoslovakia belongs 
however a us official who briefed reporters on the 
presidents talks said havel agreed that nato troops were needed 
until european nations could provide their own security 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said havel 
believed that until new security structures emerge the 
requirement for nato and the continued us presence would endure 
havel a former dissident playwright who spent five years in 
prison was the first of eastern europes new reform leaders to 
visit the white house 
after their meeting bush hailed havel as one of the heroes of 
the revolution of 89 a year that saw the old hardline communist 
government peacefully replaced by the reformers who put havel into 
the presidency 
your life is a tribute to the difference one man can make 
bush told him in a departure speech 
bush announced his intention to waive the socalled 
jacksonvanik restrictions on trade relations with communist 
governments as us and czechoslovak representatives begin 
negotiations on a new trade agreement with a goal of giving prague 
mostfavorednation status as a preferred trading partner 
granting czechoslovakia such status extending to it the same 
low tariffs available to the nations best trading partners is 
contingent on the czechoslovak parliament passing a law ending the 
former communist governments restrictive emigration policies 
congress then would would be asked to grant mostfavorednation 
status 
bush said he would also send peace corps volunteers to 
czechoslovakia by the end of summer 
havel in brief remarks said his talks with bush had been 
very important negotiations and that he was happy to have 
the opportunity to be here to explain what happened in 
czechoslovakia 
discussing his visit in a television interview before the white 
house meeting havel said 
above all i want to inform the americans about what happened 
in our country what are the international consequences of it what 
is our foreign policy what it will be and i want to lay 
foundations for a real authentic friendship between our two 
nations 
we are also interested in trade relations he said on nbcs 
today show 
after his television appearance havel went to georgetown 
university where he spent nearly an hour answering questions from 
students through an interpreter he drew laughter at one point when 
he said there no longer are any dissidents in czechoslovakia 
if there are they are in government or other high positions 
havel also said that his government is facing a difficult task 
of changing the economy and has removed all controls on freedom 
of speech 
and havel said he has no fears about german reunification so 
long as the new country is a democracy i wouldnt be afraid of a 
democratic country if it had 100 million people but i would be 
afraid of a totalitarian country with a million people he said 
havels visit comes as relations are fast warming between prague 
and washington 
our relationship has been sort of frozen with the communist 
government whose fall led to havels dec 29 installation as 
president said a senior administration official who briefed white 
house reporters about the visit and were now able to warm it 
up i think rather naturally and quickly 
havel arrived in washington on monday evening after stops in 
iceland and canada in the week before his first trip to moscow 
besides his private visit with bush in the oval office he met with 
top bush advisers and was guest at a white house lunch 
havel is not expected to seek an economic handout from 
washington but rather focus on czechoslovakias role in the future 
of europe and international financial institutions said the 
administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
havels country is on much firmer economic footing than its 
neighbors poland and hungary 
what they want is mainly language help said shirley temple 
black the us ambassador to czechoslovakia who accompanied havel 
on the helicopter trip from andrews air force base to washington 
they want to know about managing they didnt come for the 
money she said 
after arriving havel spent about 15 minutes in a very 
cordial meeting at blair house with secretary of state james a 
baker iii said havels press secretary michael zantovsky 
we are not going to the united states to beg for big economic 
aid or loans or something similar havel told the new york times 
in an interview before he left prague we are going to learn from 
a democratic system like the one we enjoyed for only so brief a 
period only 20 years and lost we can learn from american 
democracy we can learn from a highly industrialized country a 
highly developed education system and universities from many 
spheres that can serve as examples to us 
on wednesday havel speaks before a joint session of congress 
before heading to new york for business political and cultural 
meetings 
in new york he also will be feted by a rock concert in his 
honor before heading home thursday night 
havel was elected by the czechoslovak parliament a few weeks 
after a peaceful revolution ousted the hardline government of 
communist party chief milos jakes 
the countrys first parliamentary elections in more than four 
decades are planned for june 8 
havel 53 who has said he is more interested in being a writer 
than president is popular among his countrymen and has not 
announced whether he will seek election in june 
havels government has insisted the soviet union withdraw its 
73500 troops as quickly as possible and favors eventual 
dissolution of the warsaw pact some czechoslovak officials also 
have urged that nato be phased out something the bush 
administration strongly opposes

appalachian miners ratified a contract 
with pittston coal group after striking for nearly 11 months and 
were credited by labor leaders tuesday with helping to rejuvenate 
the trade union movement 
striking and laidoff united mine workers from virginia west 
virginia and kentucky voted 1247 to 734 monday to accept a 
contract nearly identical to a national umw agreement that pittston 
broke away from in may 1987 
this is a victory for all workers umw vice president cecil 
roberts told about 50 striking miners in announcing the results 
tuesday at a union office here 
the settlement ends a strike punctuated by violence sitdown 
strikes and other tactics that resulted in millions of dollars in 
fines against the union 
it could be a week to 10 days before the 1700 active miners 
return to work because mines must be reinspected and workers must 
go through training courses officials said 
umw members across the country had viewed pittston as a maverick 
company attempting to break the union a claim the company 
vigorously denied the union also felt other companies would copy 
pittstons tactics if it won concessions 
the miners got job security and health and retirement provisions 
they sought but gave up the traditional fiveday work week 
contained in the 1988 bituminous coal operators association 
contract signed by most other producers that means pittston won 
the right to operate around the clock with voluntary labor on 
sundays a day the miners traditionally have not worked 
pittston set out to try to break our union and they didnt 
succeed james hall a 57yearold striking miner from st paul 
said at a rally its a victory no doubt about that 
umw president richard trumka treasurer john banovic aflcio 
president lane kirkland and labor secretary elizabeth dole 
congratulated the miners in telephone calls from the aflcio 
convention in miami 
you rejuvenated the labor movement throughout the world with 
this strike banovic said kirkland called the strike a gallant 
struggle that was an inspiration to the entire trade union 
movement 
dole who intervened in the strike to appoint former labor 
secretary william usery to mediate a settlement called the pact an 
example of successful collective bargaining 
its a joyous day for everybody for the miners who are going 
back to work for the families who will be getting a steady 
paycheck and certainly for the company which will be going back to 
full production dole told the strikers 
during his news conference roberts called pittston president 
michael odom to tell him the contract was ratified you have been 
a worthy adversary he told odom were hoping to work just as 
hard together now 
i think the both of us can agree weve got a worthy contract 
for employees the union and the company odom said 
odom said at an afternoon news conference that some miners will 
be back on their jobs as early as thursday and most will be back to 
work next week 
umw members worked 14 months without a contract before the union 
struck on april 5 1989 
umw officials persuaded members and leaders of other unions that 
the labor movement desperately needed a victory in the pittston 
dispute and hundreds of thousands of union members converged on 
the southwestern virginia coalfields to show their support to 
further show sympathy nearly 46000 umw members from appalachia 
and the midwest went on short wildcat strikes last summer 
we all learned some lessons from this strike its better to 
talk than to fight roberts said i hope we can bring peace 
back to the coalfields of southwest virginia were going to go 
about the business now of mining coal 
arthur mabry 60 of lebanon said hes glad to be going back to 
work were going to try to work the best we can with the company 
and hopefully overcome the hard feelings he said 
the umw leadership will turn its attention to circuit judge 
donald mcglothlin who rejected a request by union and company 
attorneys to drop 64 million in strikerelated fines against the 
umw the judge gave them until thursday to try to change his mind

the supreme court said tuesday it will decide 
whether selffunded employee health care plans which cover some 
95 million americans are subject to state insurance laws and 
regulations 
the justices said they will use the case of a seriously injured 
pennsylvania teenage girl to decide whether federal regulation of 
such plans preempts any state regulation a decision is expected 
sometime in 1991 
selffunded plans are those in which all benefits are paid 
directly by an employer and not purchased through an independent 
insurance company 
the illinoisbased fmc corp has such a plan for its employees 
and their dependents and that plan paid for a substantial part of 
the more than 178000 in medical expenses incurred by cynthia ann 
holliday since a january 1987 automobile accident in indiana 
county pa 
miss holliday then 15 suffered permanent injuries when the car 
in which she was a passenger crashed 
her father gerald is an fmc employee 
holliday sued the cars driver robert lyons in state court 
under a september 1987 settlement miss hollidays recovery was 
limited to 4987550 plus interest 
when fmc sought to recover some of its expenses by claiming the 
lawsuit settlement funds holliday successfully invoked a 
pennsylvania law that prohibits such action 
fmc then turned to a federal trial judge for help contending 
that the federal employee retirement income security act erisa 
was meant to be a sole means of regulating selffunded health plans 
and that it therefore preempts the prohibitive pennsylvania law 
the judge upheld by the 3rd us circuit court of appeals last 
sept 11 ruled that state regulation of selffunded health care 
plans is not preempted by erisa 
fmcs appeal was supported by the us chamber of commerce the 
selfinsurance institute of america and numerous selffunded health 
and welfare plans 
the case is fmc corp vs holliday 891048

us sprint said tuesday the fbi is 
investigating a former employees allegations that the 
longdistance company obtained confidential information about 
competitors when it bid successfully for part of a 25 billion 
government contract 
sprint officials said the allegations first arose in august 
during an exit interview for a sprint salesman in the washington 
area whose job was eliminated during a restructuring 
spokesman syd courson in kansas city where sprint is based 
said the company investigated the allegations and found no evidence 
of wrongdoing 
courson said the former employee made broad allegations that 
sprint employees had obtained and used other longdistance 
companies confidential information when preparing sprints bid for 
the fts 2000 communications contract 
sprint the nations thirdlargest supplier of longdistance 
service won 40 percent of the giant contract industry leader atampt 
won the majority 
we chalked it up to a disgruntled employee a former 
employee courson said 
sprints internal investigation was completed in october but 
resumed later in the year after allegations assumed to be by the 
same person that sprint had tapped into the general services 
administration computer courson said 
in october a sprint employee in the washington area was 
contacted by the fbi courson said three other employees and an 
outside consultant who had worked for sprint were contacted in late 
january about the allegations 
we then contacted the fbi and told them of our findings and 
offered them various documents courson said we want to 
cooperate fully on this and get it behind us thats essentially 
where it stands 
courson said the former employee who made the allegations had 
not worked directly on sprints bid for the fts 2000 contract 
described as the biggest nonmilitary award ever handled by the 
federal government

energy futures prices ended mostly lower in 
lackluster trading tuesday pressured by supply and demand concerns 
on the new york mercantile exchange the march contract for west 
texas intermediate the main grade of us crude oil fell 23 cents 
to 2219 a 42gallon barrel the contract which expired at the 
close of trading lost 42 cents in the previous session 
the april contract ended 11 cents lower at 2214 a barrel and 
may finished at 2193 also down 11 cents 
analysts said the fivecent spread between the march and april 
closing prices did not bode well for future price expectations 
its not a bullish signal for the spread to be as weak as it 
is said tom bentz director of futures trading for united energy 
inc 
bentz said the small difference suggested weakness in demand 
if demand were up march would have been a strong premium over 
april he said 
among refined products wholesale unleaded gasoline for march 
delivery rose 021 cent to 6020 cents a gallon after losing 065 
cent in the prior session all other contracts finished lower 
no 2 heating oil for delivery in march slipped 010 cent to 
5738 cents a gallon april declined 011 cent to 5670 cents and 
may dropped 025 cent to 5562 cents a gallon 
energy analysts said activity in the energy pits was relatively 
light with many traders in london for the international petroleum 
exchange convention 
cool weather in the northeast gave heating oil futures a 
psychological boost midway through the session but buying dried up 
amid expectations that demand has weakened while inventories have 
climbed 
analysts said march gasoline got a lift from a report about an 
explosion at an amoco oil co terminal in whiting ind a truck 
loading liquefied petroleum gas into a storage tank caught fire and 
exploded killing two people and injuring three others authorities 
said 
the explosion was not expected to disrupt product shipments

interests in mining and processing metals will commence a tender 
offer of 17 per share for freeportmcmoran gold which is 61

minorco failed last year in a 62 billion bid to take over 
consolidated gold fields plc gold fields was later bought by 
hanson plc in a friendly 57 billion deal

we announced our intention of selling some assets and reducing 
our debts by 12 billion to 15 billion and using the money to

maines attorney general said he was prepared to pursue an 
antitrust suit if necessary against georgiapacific corp although 
gov john r mckernan and some mill workers were more optimistic 
about tuesdays announcement that the company was buying great 
northern nekoosa corp 
attorney general james e tierney said the state should use the 
lawsuit to protect woodcutters and landowners who could be hurt 
financially by the 5 billion buyout 
we have wood owners and woodcutters who for years have been 
able to sell to two companies and now they only have one said 
tierney who hoped to negotiate with georgiapacific for assurances 
environmentalists also had concerns that the deal would place 
more than 26 million acres about 12 percent of the land in maine 
in the hands of a single outofstate corporation groups such 
as the maine audubon society said they wanted to be sure 
atlantabased georgiapacific uses its new holdings for timber 
harvesting instead of development 
michael kellett northeast regional director of the wilderness 
society said the trend toward consolidation stifled diversity and 
created a more oligopolistic situation 
but in this case great northern already owned so much that 
im not sure its going to make a huge situation kellett said 
i do not feel any horrible sense of dread or crisis 
kellett said that in terms of land stewardship there is no huge 
difference among the paper companies 
jerry bley resource specialist with the natural resources 
council of maine said it remained to be seen whether 
georgiapacific would abide by its assurances that it will maintain 
its mill operations use its land for timber operations rather than 
sell parcels to developers to help pay debt incurred in the buyout 
great northern is headquartered in norwalk conn but is 
incorporated in maine 
mckernan said he would reserve judgment on pursuing the 
antitrust suit but he was optimistic about georgiapacifics 
willingness to continue talks on woodland preservation and job 
security for maine workers 
we have been able to work with georgiapacific they made it 
clear they wanted to be good corporate citizens they wanted to 
have the company flourish here in maine he said 
georgiapacific operates three mills in woodland in eastern 
maine and owns about 470000 acres of forest land according to the 
attorney generals office great northern owns 21 million acres 
and three mills 
great northern mill workers said they were relieved but 
apprehensive about tuesdays announcement which followed a bitter 
fourmonth takeover battle 
im kind of relieved to get it over with said fredericka 
boynton whose family has worked in the millinocket mill for 
generations i think its going to be all right you make the 
best of it

zenith electronics corp on tuesday revealed a 
disagreement with groupe bull over the final sale price of zeniths 
computer business to the french concern 
both parties agreed the issue does not threaten to derail bulls 
acquisition of zenith data systems which was effectively completed 
in december 
but because the eventual outcome will affect zeniths financial 
condition the company reported fourthquarter and annual results 
only for its consumer electronics business which consists mainly 
of televisions and tv components 
the results included a 47 percent drop in fourthquarter profit 
and a 17 million loss for all of 1989 which the company said 
reflected higher material and labor costs despite higher sales 
volume and efficiency improvements 
zenith is disputing bulls request for a 49 million refund on 
its dec 28 payment of 4964 million for zenith data systems said 
zenith spokesman john i taylor 
zenith had previously indicated that it expected a further 
payment not a refund request from bull as the final adjustment to 
the purchase price 
clearly we have a difference of opinion of significant 
magnitude zenith chairman jerry k pearlman said in a statement 
zenith characterized the disagreement as a major dispute and 
said bull may have violated the terms of their contract 
a bull spokesman denied the charge and downplayed the issue 
pointing out that zenith has 30 days to review the request and 
another 30 days in which to negotiate a resolution before an 
arbitrator steps in 
we dont see it as major dispute at all said spokesman 
patrick marx in a telephone interview from bulls paris 
headquarters 
zenith announced oct 2 an agreement to sell the computer unit 
to bull for 919 million plus the adjusted net book value of the 
assets sold for a total that zenith initially estimated at 635 
million and later lowered to an estimated 610 million 
on dec 28 bull paid zenith 4964 million in cash an 
agreedupon amount that taylor said reflected 90 percent of the sum 
of the 919 million premium and the adjusted net book value of the 
computer units assets through nov 30 
the payment effectively closed the sale of zenith data systems 
leaving only a final adjustment that would include the units asset 
value at the end of december 
the sale agreement provided for bull to submit the final 
adjustment based on an audit of zenith data systems commissioned 
by bull 
electronics analysts said the dispute was a surprise and that a 
49 million refund would hurt zenith 
if it works against them it will affect their ability to 
bring down debt levels said laura lederman an analyst with duff 
amp phelps inc in chicago 
zenith had previously estimated a 22 million fourthquarter 
operating profit from the computer unit but said tuesday that 
because of substantial deterioration in the business during 
december it expects the division to report a net loss 
for its consumer electronics business zenith reported net 
income of 4 million or 15 cents per common share for the three 
months ending dec 31 compared with 75 million or 29 cents per 
share for the same period a year ago 
fourthquarter revenue from consumer electronics rose slightly 
to 443 million from 440 million in 1988 
for the full year zenith reported a net loss from consumer 
electronics of of 17 million or 64 cents a share compared with a 
net loss of 11 million or 42 cents a share in 1988 
annual revenue from consumer electronics rose 11 percent to 15 
billion from 14 billion in 1988

walt disney co chairman michael eisner 
on tuesday labeled reports of a possible merger with broadcasting 
giant cbs inc as rumors 
but asked about the possibility of a merger by one of 9000 
disney shareholders at disneys annual meeting eisner added 
that is not to say we wouldnt talk to them havent talked to 
them 
the shareholder cited repeated reports in business and 
entertainment trade publications of a possible takeover of cbs by 
cashrich disney which is rapidly expanding its entertainment 
theme parks resorts and consumer products businesses 
disney earned 703 million in fiscal 1989 35 percent more than 
in 1988 
we dont comment on any rumors eisner said at the meeting 
held at a convention center near disneyland acknowledging the 
persistence of the reports he added if we did comment we would 
have to comment every day on ridiculous rumors 
eisner and disney president frank wells were brought in to run 
disney at the end of 1984 and since then the company has boomed 
with sharply higher revenues expansions of moviemaking and theme 
parks and the decision last year to start a record label 
the executives reviewed disneys overlapping plans to exploit 
its trademark characters in theme parks resorts television 
movies recordings and magazines 
they showed off italianlanguage disney comics and planned 
software to allow computer users to create their own disney 
animation displayed a prototype of a planned mickey mouse magazine 
in russian and said polish and hungarian versions were being 
developed and described the promotional blitz of products that 
will accompany disneys dick tracy movie this summer 
they also said disney hopes to expand its stores from 41 now to 
perhaps 200 with outlets in tokyo and paris reviewed previously 
announced plans to add new attractions to its theme parks and open 
allnew parks in california japan and florida and said they would 
court convention business with new hotels to help during slow 
periods 
epitomizing how disney is expanding and blending its franchises 
was a tape of miss piggy disney acquired rights to the muppets 
last year singing some day my prince will come from 
cinderella in french for a christmas special on european 
television 
a great percentage of our growth potential lies outside our 
borders wells said 
the wholesome image nurtured by founder walt disney was foremost 
in the minds of many shareholders who peppered eisner with 
questions about concerns over movies for mature audiences put out 
by disneys touchstone studio soon to be joined by hollywood 
pictures a third disney studio 
asked about the use of fourletter words in those pictures 
eisner said im no more pleased to see bette midler use an 
expletive than to see my 16yearold use an expletive 
but he said our movies tend to reflect society adding that 
disney can never hope to attract top filmmakers if we become 
censors 
another shareholder asked whether disney was worried about 
losing the publics confidence by releasing crime terror and 
violence such as dick tracy and cocktail which starred tom 
cruise 
i believe there is a place for all kinds of movies if they are 
correctly labeled eisner said he said he thought viewers would 
find dick tracy to be clearly a disney film and less 
violent than it appeared in the trailer 
separately disney said tuesday it was increasing the companys 
quarterly cash dividend from 12 cents per share to 14 cents per 
share the dividend is payable may 15 to shareholders of record on 
april 13

finish his term earlier paid a civil penalty of 100 million to 
the sec for trading on inside information 
ward who has denied any wrongdoing and is fighting extradition

facing saunders 54 heron group chairman gerald ronson 50 
stockbroker anthony parnes 44 and millionaire financier sir jack 
lyons 74 they have pleaded innocent 
the prosecution alleges an illegal operation to spend the 
equivalent of 425 million boosting the price of guinness stock to 
make its cash and share bid for distilers more attractive in the 
face of a rival bid from supermarket operator argyll group plc 
the prosecution alleges ward illegally received the equivalent 
of 88 million following the takeover and authorized an illicit 
payment of the equivalent of 510000 to lyons

to pay bills incurred in the united states but he gave only 
vague descriptions of the work done roux said 
roux said ward wanted the money put into an offshore bank 
account of a company named marketing and acquisitions consultants 
to maintain confidentiality 
the prosecution alleged ward used the account to receive 
personal payments 
roux said he was concerned because all payments to directors had 
to be disclosed to the full board but saunders confirmed the 
payment and reassured him the money was not going to ward 
personally 
when the prosecutor concluded his opening statement on monday 
he claimed that saunders received 51 million from the payment 
made to ward and kept it in a secret swiss bank account

chevron corp said tuesday it was cutting 
its us oil exploration and production business because of 
diminishing oil reserves in the continental united states and 
public opposition to offshore drilling 
chevron usa the domestic oil and gas subsidiary of the 
nations thirdlargest oil company said it expects to eliminate 
800 to 1000 positions or 10 to 12 percent of the organization 
including middle and senior managers 
chevron which will expand its international exploration and 
production plans to accelerate sales of us assets by unloading 
about 1000 of its 1700 domestic oil fields for some 700 million 
over the next two years 
the company said it will sell the fields which account for only 
11 percent of current production to small or regional operators 
for whom the fields might make a better fit or negotiate trades 
with large companies 
the changes are expected to result in a charge against 1990 
firstquarter earnings of between 25 million and 30 million the 
company said 
chevron with 345 billion in assets took a 12 billion 
charge against fourthquarter 1989 earnings primarily because of an 
inactive oil field and environmental cleanup costs the charge led 
to an 883 million loss for the quarter and depressed 1989 profits 
to 251 million from 177 billion in 1988 
chevrons problems left its stock undervalued according to 
analysts and vulnerable to a takeover or restructuring 
that in turn spurred heavy trading in recent months while 
chevron engaged in a legal battle to force pennzoil co to sell its 
88 percent share of chevron stock chevron said it is worried that 
pennzoil would try to use its position to force a restructuring 
detrimental to chevron stockholders 
wall street reacted with mild enthusiasm to tuesdays 
announcement as chevrons stock down 112 before the release hit 
the wire late in the trading day rebounded slightly to close down 
67 cents at 6925 
im very encouraged said frederick leuffer an analyst with 
cj lawrence morgan grenfell inc in new york i think it 
represents a turn for the company all the details are not out 
this is only a relatively modest step in the right direction we 
should find out more tomorrow 
chevron executives scheduled a meeting with analysts wednesday 
in new york 
the company said its restructuring is aimed mostly at cutting 
layers of management and lowering operating costs to make it more 
competitive and enhance profitability and shareholders investments 
leuffer said chevron the nations third largest oil company 
after exxon corp and mobil oil corp is vastly undervalued he 
placed its value at at least 116 a share and said the stock 
could reach 90 a share 
in 1988 and 1989 chevron sold about 210 million worth of 
domestic assets 
the company said it hoped that many staff cuts could be achieved 
voluntarily 
the organizational changes include 
chevron usas three current exploration land and 
production regions based in san ramon calif houston and new 
orleans will be eliminated including their management 
organization structure and positions 
in place of the regional organization the exploration and 
production functions will be divided into seven distinct business 
units each directly responsible for its own financial performance 
plus a centralized land department all will report to a chevron 
usa senior vice president in san francisco 
in production five business units will be set up headquartered 
in bakersfield calif denver midland and houston texas and new 
orleans current production activities now managed from ventura 
calif will be consolidated and report to the bakersfield office

officials of eastern airlines met tuesday with 
major creditors in an effort to reach agreement on a new plan for 
its bankruptcy reorganization 
easterns exclusive right to file such a plan was due to expire 
at midnight unless the federal bankruptcy court granted the airline 
another extension 
representatives of the airline and its creditors continued to 
meet late tuesday and planned to extend the discussions into 
wednesday said karen ceremsak a spokeswoman for eastern at its 
headquarters in miami she declined to provide further details 
ms ceremsak said it appeared unlikely that eastern would 
request an extension of tuesdays end to its exclusive period 
because creditors were negotiating with eastern and unlikely to 
file their own reorganization plan 
creditors attorneys and other representatives couldnt be 
reached for comment 
last monday us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland granted 
easterns request for an eightday extension to tuesday of the 
deadline for filing its reorganization plan on an exclusive basis 
during that time other parties such as creditors cannot submit 
competing proposals 
lifland extended the deadline after several parties in the 
proceeding said progress had been made toward agreement on a plan 
eastern has been restructuring under bankruptcy court 
supervision since a bitter strike began last march 4 
david i shapiro the courtappointed examiner overseeing 
easterns chapter 11 proceeding supported easterns request last 
week for an extension and told lifland that substantial 
progress is being made in negotiations between the airline and 
its creditors 
the committee representing unsecured creditors also supported 
easterns petition 
even representatives of preferred shareholders who recently 
advocated liquidation or outright sale of eastern supported the 
airlines request for more time 
the preferred shareholders had criticized easterns latest 
reorganization proposal which proposes to pay them no more than 10 
cents on the dollar in the form of new stock 
easterns latest plan also calls for paying unsecured creditors 
only 10 percent of their debts in cash when the airline emerges 
from bankruptcy protection and 70 percent more over the following 
10 years without interest 
in return for accepting partial repayment easterns parent 
texas air corp would give the unsecured creditors 40 percent of 
easterns equity 
lawyers representing the air line pilots association and the 
machinists union have opposed easterns requests for extensions of 
the deadline 
last weeks extension was the fourth granted by lifland since 
the bankruptcy proceeding began last march 9 
the eastern pilots and flight attendants abandoned their 
sympathy strikes just before thanksgiving but eastern had rebuilt 
as a smaller carrier and hired mostly nonunion workers to replace 
the strikers the machinists union remains on strike against the 
carrier

a man who was accused of embezzling more than 
200000 from house accounts at prudentialbache securities has 
been sentenced to 24 months probation 
richard kofler who pleaded guilty june 29 to one count of 
felony mail fraud also was ordered by us district judge john 
keenan in manhattan to pay 6840160 in restitution 
assistant us attorney kerry lawrence said that in addition to 
the restitution kofler had agreed with prudentialbache to pay 
back an additional amount to the firm 
kofler 38 of staten island admitted during his plea that he 
used his position as an operations manager to transfer shares from 
a prudentialbache mutual fund account to a fictitious account 
kofler said he wrote letters in the name of the fictitious 
account holder asking that the shares be redeemed and sent to one 
or more private post office boxes 
keenan told kofler he was imposing the lenient sentence 
primarily at the request of the us attorneys office but he 
warned kofler that any similar future conduct would result in a 
jail term 
lawrence said he did not know if kofler still works in the 
securities industry and declined to comment on why his office 
sought leniency
