ousted president nicolae ceausescu and 
his wife elena were executed monday after they were convicted of 
genocide and grave crimes against romania at a secret military 
trial the provisional government said 
ceausescu 71 the last hardline communist leader in the warsaw 
pact was chased from power friday after his dreaded security 
forces massacred thousands protesting his repressive 24year rule 
and harsh economic policies 
he and his wife who served as a virtual secondincommand were 
executed by firing squad after a trial at an undisclosed location 
according to bucharest radio and romanian television 
the radio and television which formerly were controlled by 
ceausescu are under control of the national salvation comittee 
the new provisional government 
fighting in central bucharest which continued spporadically 
late into the night had driven many people from the streets by the 
time the announcement of the executions was made around 830 pm 
130 pm est however cheers rang out from the few people on 
the streets and from apartment balconies 
the broadcasts on both radio and television did not specify 
where the executions took place 
romanian television early tuesday showed the ceausescus before 
their execution being brought to an undisclosed location in an 
armored car 
ceausecu dressed in a dark suit and a heavy black overcoat 
looked gaunt and tired but smiled as a man in a white coat checked 
his blood pressure his wife looked forlorn as she sat against a 
wall dressed in a beige furlined coat with her head covered 
peasantstyle in a scarf 
the footage also included a scene of the couple sitting at a 
wooden table apparently at their trial 
romanian staff at the hotel intercontinental clustered cheering 
around a television set when the film appeared some even spat in 
the direction of the television in a gesture of contempt 
the film was the first of ceausescu to be shown since the new 
government announced his capture saturday 
bucharest radio blamed the ceausescus for the deaths of more 
than 60000 romanians and said they plundered the poor country of 
more than 1 billion that they deposited in foreign banks the 
report did not make clear whether the deaths occurred during the 
11day uprising that toppled ceausescu or during his entire tenure 
oh what wonderful news an unidentified announcer said 
the antichrist died on christmas day the announcer said 
ceausescu became the first eastern european leader executed 
since imre nagy the leader of hungarys revolt against soviet rule 
who has hanged in june 1958 
the radio interrupted patriotic music to make the announcment 
that the couple had been executed after being convicted by a 
military tribunal of particularly grave crimes including 
subversion of the state theft of public assets destruction of the 
national economy and an attempt to escape 
today we removed the most hideous tyrant who soiled with 
blood the history of romania an unidentified radio announcer 
said lets be happy in the new year 
the couple built a cult of personality unequaled in eastern 
europe since the days of josef stalin his party hailed him as 
the conducator and the genius of carpathians 
just one month ago the communist party gave ceausescu another 
fiveyear term in a lavish show of support for his rejection of 
reforms sweeping eastern europe 
the national salvation committee had announced over the weekend 
that it would put the ceausescus on trial and impose severe 
punishment it was not immediately clear why the committee pledging 
to restore democracy in romania chose to put the ceausescus on 
trial in secret and execute them immediately 
the decision could have stemmed from an attempt to stop the 
fierce fighting in bucharest and other cities between the 
proceausescu security forces and the army which is supporting the 
popular revolt 
we regret the trial did not take place in an open and public 
fashion white house spokesman sean walsh said in washington 
we urge an end to all violence and bloodshed in romania 
ceausescu came to power in 1965 and built an autocratic 
stalinist regime but was once courted by the west for his refusal 
to slavishly follow the soviet line in recent years his regime 
became isolated and was criticized for the forced destruction of 
ethnic villages and the draconian measures imposed to pay off the 
nations foreign debt 
ceausescu and his 72yearold wife fled the presidential palace 
by helicopter friday 
their last public appearance was at a governmentorchestrated 
rally thursday in bucharest at which thousands of angry people 
jeered them and demanded their ouster ceausescu appeared startled 
and halted his speech his troops later fired on the crowd 
the ceausescus son nicu and daughter zoiaelena were paraded 
before tv viewers after their arrests on friday and sunday 
on monday ceausescus diehard security agents continued to 
battle army patrols and snipers fired at civilians venturing onto 
bucharest streets the fighting followed some of the fiercest 
fighting in europe since world war ii

heavy explosions boomed near the hotel intercontinental and 
volleys of sniper fire were answered immediately with staccato 
bursts of automatic weapons 
there were widely conflicting reports on the number of 
casualties claimed by the revolution 
hungarian radio named unspecified authoritative sources as 
saying that between 70000 and 80000 people had died then it 
cited victor ciobanu health minister under ceausescu and now in 
opposition to him as denying that such a large number of people 
had died 
while unable to provide overall casualty figures he told 
reporters 500 people had died in bucharest alone over the past four 
days and 2000 were wounded 
that was on the low end of several estimates offered by 
officials and appeared to contradict figures given by doctors 
operating on the wounded there was no way to independently verify 
the casualty figures 
at bucharest emergency hospital doctors who had not slept in 
three days said they had treated 2000 civilians since thursday a 
fraction of the city total by sunday afternoon 90 bodies had 
arrived at one of several morgues 
army troops sealed off wide areas of the battlescarred capital 
in preparation for a buildingtobuilding search of other 
securitate snipers supporting ceausescu 
a member of the new national salvation committee said his 
transitional government was in control of romania but acknowledged 
that much remained to be done 
even myself i spent all night at the emergecy hospital ion 
grigorescu said lifting a cuff to show a bandage and producing the 
snipers bullet that caught him in the leg as he went to the radio 
by monday at least 12 nations including the united states 
had recognized the new leadership 
christmas dominated bucharest despite the turmoil with radio 
broadcasting mass and christmas carols for the first time in 
decades and churches filled to overflowing 
at the patriarhie orthodox cathedral in downtown bucharest 
worshipers caught an agent of the security police trying to sneak a 
hand grenade into christmas mass after a woman started shouting 
we know this man hes a terrorist he was led away by soldiers 
armed with automatic rifles 
weekend reports that foreigners had been fighting alongside 
ceausescus elite troops appeared to be gaining some credence 
monday 
doctors at the emergency hospital said they treated two men they 
identified only as arabs and two more believed to be north koreans 
one of the arabs admitted under sedation to being part of a 
400man elite ceausescu guard committed to holding out until death 
if needed for the defense of ceausescu said one of the doctors 
asking that he not be named 
the crackling of machinegun fire could be heard from some 
bucharest suburbs but did not deter crowds from taking to the 
streets 
people clustered around spontaneous soapbox speakers denouncing 
communism and generally enjoying their first chance to sound off in 
public in four generations 
the media under the stern grip of censorship for more than four 
decades also was showing a freer face 
spark the rigidly loyal communist party newspaper that was 
dominated by pictures and reports of ceausescu up to his fall 
appeared under the name of the truth mondays edition published an 
appeal of the national salvation committee the interim leadership 
of the country for all civilians to surrender their arms 
alongside letters from former ceausescu officials expressing 
support for the committee 
among the array of new newspapers sprouting up over the weekend 
was one called free youth which denounced ceausescu as the 
worlds most atrocious criminal language unthinkable just 11 
days ago 
we have lost an epic of darkness and unthinkable terror on 
earth we have also lost the fear to go out on the steets and 
defend romania with our hearts a frontpage editorial in free 
youth proclaimed 
thousands of romanians reportedly were massacred by security 
officers who opened fire on unarmed antigovernment protesters in 
the western romanian city of timisoara dec 17 two days after the 
start of demonstrations the revolt spread across the country and 
reached bucharest thursday when students defied gunfire to chant 
for freedom

editors note if new years day seems strangely muted next

departing ed koch who stretched another kind of color line to the 
outer limit

he goes as he came possibly the most 
effervescent politician of the dying decade 
to effervesce mr webster says is to bubble and hiss if 
anything the unretiring retiring mayor of new york now leaves 
office after 12 noisy years with more bubble than hiss 
god has been very nice to me ed koch concludes without 
suggesting that god ever got a single word in edgewise 
american leaders cross the bridge from power to private life in 
a variety of moods ulysses s grant worried about money william 
howard taft felt like a giant locomotive suddenly pulling a toy 
train herbert hoover and jimmy carter felt dejected and rejected 
ed koch was also rejected by the voters but not never by ed 
koch he sounds like the happiest lame duck in the pond 
he says he no longer feels like sisyphus of greek mythology 
trying every day to push a huge boulder up a mountain and every 
day near the top watching it roll back down 
but now now im crossing over into the promised land he 
says arms akimbo grinning to his ears little brown eyes dancing 
bald pate dazzling in the reflected light of a new dawn 
no more decisions i dont have to alienate anybody suddenly 
im popular again maybe its nostalgia maybe revisionism is 
setting in early but even the columnists who reviled me unfairly 
are saying nice things 
the job of mayor could shorten your life god extended mine i 
came through that stroke two years ago with no diminution of 
faculties mother teresa prayed for my full recovery and she is a 
powerful person 
i am a lucky man i can sing and dance i can walk and talk 
encountering no resistance to that last verb koch said he was 
looking forward to the practice of law lecturing around the 
country teaching at new york university writing a column for the 
new york post and doing tv and radio commentary all in all he is 
expected to avoid the poverty line by about 500000 a year 
in a farewell interview with the associated press koch spoke 
warmly of the new york police during his tenure he went to 50 
police funerals and wept and as his days in city hall dwindled 
down he tried to visit every one of the citys police precincts 
during shapeup to thank them and say goodbye 
he told them his plans and offered to help anybody who thought 
koch could be of help as a private citizen he had pictures taken 
with them now and then a policeman stepped forward made a little 
sentimental speech and gave the departing mayor a present like a 
sweat shirt 
koch leaves a lovely muted office in a corner of city hall 
gently decorated with graceful paintings comfortable furniture and 
a restrained number of pictures taken with foreign dignitaries the 
room suggested little connection with the raucous world outside 
here the mayor received visitors in shirt sleeves and usually in 
full gallop 
the job of mayor of new york is often called the second toughest 
in the country had this mayor ever thought of going for the 
toughest 
no 
not even one teensy passing thought about becoming the first 
jewish president of the united states 
no no no its never been part of my lifes goals i swear 
it never entered my mind that it was doable running for governor 
and losing was foolish enough 
city hall he insists was pinnacle enough and he leaves on a 
high proud he was one of only three men to serve three terms 
confident of his place in history feeling in no way a loser or 
ignored he says fiorello la guardia was new yorks greatest mayor 
but didnt become that in peoples minds until years after he 
served 
as for his own record im proud of bringing fiscal stability 
back to the city of returning a spirit people had lost when we 
felt like beggars under predecessors abe beame and john lindsay 
i gave people back a sense of themselves and a sense of humor and a 
sense of getting things done 
he closes out 25 years of public service as district leader 
city councilman member of congress and mayor still he does not 
fear decompression leaving power and the march of great events he 
is particularly confident he will not have to fight back tears 
leaving reporters 
he says he took much unfair abuse from the media in the kind of 
coverage that keeps good people from running for public office he 
particularly will not miss six columnists he doesnt name who he 
says wrote with one voice like clones of each other he said 
they actually took part in political campaigns to defeat him 
because im such a powerful personality i gave life back to 
city hall made it relevant again i exercised the power of an 
office that had gone into eclipse and so i was blamed if a sparrow 
fell anywhere in the city 
six large sparrows were convicted of corruption during kochs 
tenure each was like a dagger in my heart and ill never get 
over it in this respect i think my administration was equal to 
the best but we got the worst attacks from the press in lindsays 
time the entire police force was corrupt one of his commissioners 
even sold a reservoir to organized crime 
oh yes koch is doing another book which reminds him of the 
time a brooklyn rabbi was showing him around there the rabbi 
pointed is the biggest library on jews in the world 
koch do you have my books 
rabbi which ones 
koch mayor politics and his eminence and hizzoner 
written with cardinal john oconnor in alternating chapters 
rabbi well take the first two 
koch why not the third 
rabbi you know we cant have his book in our library 
koch you could tell your people to read every other chapter

some advertisers promoting vacation spots 
hundreds of miles from wyoming have the power to move mountains 
the picturesque grand teton and its sister mountains have been 
used in ads for amtrak which doesnt run through wyoming and such 
places as a resort in montana and even a condominium in the heart 
of the rockies in colorado 
for the record the tetons have been standing firm in 
northwestern wyoming for eons 
and while imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery the 
jackson hole chamber of commerce isnt happy to see the craggy 
peaks plastered on brochures touting destinations that dont have a 
view of the range even on a clear day 
the tetons are one of the most recognizable mountain ranges in 
the world and we are more than a little miffed that our competitors 
continue to use our assets to promote their areas said carol 
waller the chambers director of marketing we are seriously 
considering trademarking the tetons im only halfjoking 
while managers of those outofsight resorts responded with 
shock or embarrassment when queried about their use of the tetons 
none offered any apologies not even resort managers in colorado 
which boasts of being home to the greatest skiing in the world 
larry dempsey general manager of the crestwood condominium 
hotel in snowmass village colo just north of aspen said he 
didnt even realize his magazine advertisement of a skier used the 
tetons as a backdrop 
no matter he said the picture is representative of a winter 
ski vacation in the colorado rockies even if the tetons are 
nearly 400 miles north 
the ad agency that used the tetons on the brochure couldnt say 
much more than oops 
it was just a case of mistaken identity said bill cutting 
of the agency penna powers cutting and haynes of salt lake city 
believe me we had no intention of using the tetons to advertise 
a condo project in aspen 
still he said the tetons do resemble aspens maroon bells 
when you look at one mountain from 25 different angles it 
would be difficult to tell the difference said cutting besides 
he insisted no one reading one of the brochures would know the 
difference or care much either 
except waller she is contacting the resorts to ask them to 
retract their advertisements 
one of those being contacted is the fairmont hot springs resort 
in gregson mont it uses a brochure with a full view of the nearly 
14000foot grand teton crown jewel of the teton range 
naturally inviting the cover says 
resort manager ed henrich said the tetons were used when the 
marketing company couldnt find any stock photos of montanas 
pintlar mountains 
i was totally against it but we had to get something out on 
the market immediately he said no you cannot see the tetons 
from montana but they look an awful lot like the pintlars 
waller says its false advertising 
i cant say how much its hurting us but wed rather not 
confuse people they might see the beautiful mountains and wonder 
if they are in california wyoming montana or colorado wed just 
like them to know theyre in wyoming she said theyre not 
portable

romanias provisional government thanked those nations who have 
sent humanitarian aid to the besieged country and said it would 
welcome more 
the national salvation committee which has set itself up as the 
leadership in romania said sunday night that medical assistance 
drugs and food already have arrived from france the soviet union 
bulgaria czechoslovakia and hungary 
but as offers of aid poured in east bloc media said few 
supplies were able to get through because of the heavy fighting 
that continued in the streets 
in terms of military aid frances foreign minister offered 
sunday to help put together a brigade of volunteers to help 
romanians fight security forces loyal to ousted communist dictator 
nicolae ceausescu 
foreign minister roland dumas said that if the soviet union 
believed it necessary to intervene in romania on the side of the 
anticeausescu forces france not only would not object to it 
but would support this action 
us secretary of state james a baker iii said the bush 
administration would not object if the soviets or other warsaw pact 
nations used their armed forces to assist the anticeausescu forces 
they are attempting to put off the yoke of a very very 
oppressive and repressive dictatorship so i think that we would be 
inclined probably to follow the lead follow the example of france 
who today has said that if the warsaw pact felt it necessary to 
intervene on behalf of the opposition that it would support that 
asked directly whether the united states would not object to a 
warsaw pact military intervention in romania where bloody street 
fighting has followed the ouster of ceausescu baker said on nbcs 
meet the press that would be my view yes 
there was no indication of imminent military intervention by 
soviet forces soviet premier nikolai i ryzhkov said saturday that 
sending the red army to romania would be impermissible and a 
repetition of past mistakes 
romanianborn playwright eugene ionesco who lives in france 
urged the west to provide military aid in arms and ammunition to 
the regular romanian army so it can defend the people against the 
agents of the security police 
france has sent two planeloads of medical supplies and emergency 
medical teams to romania in a mission led by bernard kouchner 
minister for humanitarian action in the socialist government 
romanias agerpres news agency said the national salvation 
committee thanked all governments that have offered humanitarian 
assistance to romania at a time when the people were fighting to 
liquidate the terrorist gangs of the deposed dictator 
it added that the provisional government welcomes with 
gratitude any humanitarian help 
cubas radio reloj reported sunday night that it had sent blood 
plasma and food to bucharest 
taking into account the high number of injured people and 
victims that have been caused by the recent tragic events in 
romania the cuban government has sent humanitarian aid to that 
country the report said

the hunt for manuel antonio noriega is over 
but president bush still is searching for ways to bring the 
expanamanian dictator to justice even though he is now closeted in 
the vatican ambassadors home a white house spokesman says 
bush learned at camp david late sunday afternoon shortly after 
returning from a pentagon briefing that noriega had surfaced 
seeking asylum at the residence of the papal nuncio in panama city 
after five days on the run 
the first reaction from white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
was that noriegas reign of terror is over 
but drugtrafficking indictments still hang over noriegas head 
and us authorities are weighing options for dealing with the 
fugitive exdictator 
under international law if the vatican grants noriega asylum 
us forces cannot legally enter the papal embassy to arrest him 
president bush is gratified that general noriega has been 
located the president is pleased that operation just cause 
is on course the united states will continue to pursue avenues for 
bringing general noriega now located to justice fitzwater said 
the italian news agency ansa quoted the papal nuncio in panama 
city monsignor sebastiano laboa as indicating he would not hand 
over noriega to the united states or the new usbacked government 
in panama 
sen jesse helms rnc said late sunday that sources in 
panama told him noriega is seeking to be permitted to leave and 
go to one of two or three countries including cuba 
sources in panama familiar with the situation told the 
associated press that the papal nuncio had mentioned to other 
diplomats the possibility of noriega going to spain or cuba 
helms said he spoke to white house chief of staff john sununu 
who tells me that they are in strenuous negotiations with the 
vatican pointing out that he is not there for political reasons 
i asked him if the prospects look good and he says they dont 
look bad because the church realizes how the people feel in 
panama 
fitzwater said a highranking deputies committee led by 
deputy national security adviser robert gates met sunday afternoon 
and night to discuss the options 
we just cant speculate on any course of action for the 
present said fitzwater we still are pursuing ways to bring 
him to justice 
asked if anyone now would get the 1 million reward the united 
states had offered for noriegas capture fitzwater said no i 
dont think so 
defense secretary dick cheney who traveled to panama on 
christmas eve learned en route that noriega had sought asylum 
i am delighted that general noriega has finally been run to 
ground he said on arrival at howard air force base four miles 
west of panama city 
now it is up to the lawyers and the diplomats to figure out 
what is next cheney said as far as im concerned the 
military has done its job 
earlier before getting the news bush promised stepped up 
humanitarian aid for the beleaguered population of panama city and 
praised the performance of the 26000 us troops there as 
outstanding 
bush had interrupted his own holiday weekend at camp david md 
to huddle with military chiefs at the pentagon 
he also delivered a radio address to us armed forces around 
the world saying americans possess the strength to confront 
tyranny when we must general noriega is the latest one to learn 
that lesson 
bush departed the pentagon flashing a thumbsup sign and telling 
reporters he sensed a real turnaround 
even before noriega surfaced bush and other us officials were 
cheered by the return of a semblance of order to panama citys 
streets and the surrender of four of noriegas top military 
commanders 
fitzwater said more than 20000 weapons had been captured and 
thousands of other arms turned in by members of the army noriega 
used to lead the panama defense forces he said more than 1000 
former pdf soldiers have returned to duty in the countrys new 
security force law and order is being successfully restored and 
signs of normal commercial life are beginning to emerge said 
fitzwater 
the shelves of stores across panama city had been stripped bare 
by looters in the lawless days after the dec 20 invasion that 
toppled noriega 
bush told reporters the emphasis now is on cleaning up the 
last parts of resistance seeing that civilian government takes 
over tranquility in the city is an important goal 
he said american troops are now putting a great deal of proper 
emphasis on humanitarian concerns including getting food and 
medicine to the populace 
cheney said earlier sunday on abcs this week with david 
brinkley that the us forces still have a lot of work to do 
to restore order and put down the last resistance in panama 
but noriegas decision to seek asylum removed bushs biggest 
worry the fear that the crafty devil as one us general 
called him might be able to wage a prolonged guerilla war against 
us troops and the fledgling government of president guillermo 
endara 
bush was staying at camp david until wednesday with his five 
children and their families including 11 grandchildren he leaves 
then for a fiveday hunting and fishing trip to texas and alabama 
he also planned to spend part of sunday new years eve 
visiting servicemen wounded in panama at military hospitals in san 
antonio texas 
this christmas eve was the 45th anniversary of bushs own return 
home from the pacific war front as a decorated navy combat pilot 
during world war ii 
then as now he said there are times when america must 
sacrifice in the cause of peace 
in panama as in every other such test in our history 
americans put their lives on the line for the basic values of 
liberty and decency on which our nation is founded the president 
said

third world countries though struggling with 
poverty violence and debt have made big strides in schooling 
their children and prolonging peoples lives in recent years 
according to figures assembled by the world bank 
the world bank is the biggest source of aid loans to the third 
world it collects data on 185 countries and territories in the 
world bank atlas the 1989 edition was published recently 
take sri lanka the island republic off the coast of india torn 
by ethnic conflict among a population with an average income of 
only 420 a year 
between 1970 and 1988 the country increased life expectancy for 
newborn children from 64 to 71 years not far from this countrys 
75 years 
the number of children a sri lankan mother could expect to have 
dropped to 26 in 1988 from 43 in 1970 reducing the size of the 
future population is important in a country that crowds more than 
16 million people into an area smaller than the state of maine 
by 1986 the date of the most recent figures 84 percent of sri 
lankan children were in school up from 71 percent in 1970 
india too a country much more populous than sri lanka and even 
poorer had built schools for 60 percent of its children in 1986 
compared with 49 percent in 1970 parents of an indian baby born 
last year could expect it to live until age 55 instead of only 48 
in 1970 
between 1965 and 1986 food supplies went down in some of the 
poorest areas ethiopia chad zaire and nigeria africas most 
populous country but many of the 42 areas in the banks low 
income group showed an increase in food supplies including 
indonesia nepal laos malawi and tanzania 
the average indonesian for example had a daily average of only 
1800 calories available in 1965 by 1986 that had risen to 2579 
calories though the average citizen was earning only 500 a year 
americans have an average daily supply of 3645 calories 
even africa has progress to show though incomes have gone down 
in many countries since they emerged from colonial rule in the 
1960s togo for example claimed to have 78 percent of its girls 
in elementary school in 1986 up from only 32 percent in 1965 togo 
got its independence from france in 1960 incomes have been 
dropping throughout the 1980s averaging 370 last year 
in 1965 togo had one physician for 23240 people yet by 1984 
the average had improved to one doctor for 8720 people that was a 
long way from this countrys 470 prospective patients per doctor 
but still a considerable improvement 
many latin americans are especially proud of progress in 
education although otherwise they speak of the 1980s as a lost 
decade incomes have declined in many areas wealthy citizens 
have sent much of their wealth abroad and the burden of foreign 
debt has increased greatly 
for instance a poor country like bolivia was educating 87 
percent of its children in primary school in 1986 93 percent of 
the boys and 82 percent of the girls compared with 73 percent in 
1965 it also increased the number of young people in higher 
education to 19 percent from 5 percent 
countries where women traditionally have been at a disadvantage 
were giving them more education the number of girls in secondary 
schools rose from 5 percent in 1965 to 27 percent in 1986 in 
morocco and from 15 percent to 54 percent in egypt in the same 
time span

a top soviet official rules out military 
intervention in romania but secretary of state james a baker iii 
says the bush administration would not object if soviet troops 
helped revolutionaries battling loyalists to deposed communist 
despot nicolae ceausescu 
romanians are attempting to put off the yoke of a very very 
oppressive and repressive dictatorship so i think that we would be 
inclined probably to follow the lead follow the example of france 
who today has said that if the warsaw pact felt it necessary to 
intervene on behalf of the opposition that it would support 
that baker said sunday on the nbctv program meet the press 
dutch government officials also said they would not oppose 
soviet or warsaw pact military intervention if it would support 
the aspirations of the romanian people 
however soviet premier nikolai i ryshkov said saturday that 
sending the red army to romania would be impermissible and a 
repetition of past mistakes 
us officials by late sunday detected no sign of foreign 
intervention in romania where fierce fighting continued between 
ceausescu backers and the national salvation committee said 
defense secretary dick cheney 
it is obviously our hope that the proreform forces will win 
but its still a very hairy situation a great deal of violence 
and i would think that the outcome is probably still in doubt 
cheney said on the abctv program this week with david brinkley 
we havent seen any sign of any outside intervention said 
cheney 
president bush speaking briefly to reporters in washington 
said the british ambassador to romania took refuge in the us 
embassy in bucharest because his embassy was destroyed 
the british embassy was razed and so the british ambassador is 
now our guest i understand so that has been a very traumatic 
prechristmas uprising bush said after speaking by telephone 
with the us ambassador to bucharest alan green 
the french offered to send volunteers to fight for romanias 
national salvation committee baker asked whether america was 
prepared to send us troops into romania said any such decision 
would rest with bush 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters later 
we dont have any indication that there is a chance of the 
soviets going in at least not at this time so we dont expect 
that to occur 
asked about bakers comment fitzwater added we could see a 
situation that might be severe enough where thered be a need to 
help establish law and order but he said that it certainly is 
not necessary now and does not appear to be necessary 
baker said us officials were in contact with the 
revolutionaries but he declined to give specifics 
weve had some discussions with representatives of the new 
group and weve been encouraging in our comments and frankly we 
would like to see this be resolved in as peaceful a fashion as 
possible but we think it is important that there be a move toward 
freedom and greater political pluralism in romania baker said

each month jim barclays robot toby 
receives a love letter full of yearning from a mysterious 
girlfriend as she travels the country 
nobody has seen the girlfriend called jodi but her letters 
arrive about once a month bearing postmarks from all over 
sometimes she even takes the robot along 
barclay a practical joker himself doesnt know whos behind 
the elaborate scheme that began with the robots arrival last 
christmas at the rea clinic in this southern illinois town of 3000 
i dont want to know whose doing it he said im having a 
ball out of it 
barclay a printer and maintenance worker at the clinic said he 
came to work one morning and found the foothigh goldtoned 
plastic robot in his chair 
an accompanying note read jim maybe toby can work the second 
shift and help catch up santa 
barclay said his wife margene and each of the clinics 50 
employees denied any involvement so began the string of 19 love 
letters gifts and even tobys temporary disappearance 
every month to six weeks another card comes to the clinic for 
toby barclay said 
when we get a card everybody at the clinic gets excited 
barclay said recently 
the letters have come from as far away as eagle colo and 
tampa fla 
that one we got from florida it was a tearjerker i sat here 
and tears came to my eyes he was standing over there doing 
nothing barclay said nodding in tobys direction in mock 
disgust 
toby walks and plays a programmed message but doesnt do much 
else around the shop barclay said 
the postmarks give clues about jodis travels but the gifts and 
disappearances have confused him 
barclay came to work one morning and toby was gone replaced by 
a note saying the robot was with jodi a week later barclay 
arrived at work to find toby back along with a note saying the 
robot and jodi had enjoyed a trip to wisconsin wisconsin cheese in 
the refrigerator was for barclay the note said 
the intrigue continued in september when jodi and toby took off 
to wausau wis and spent a week at the marshfield clinic a 
regional rural health center barclay said 
when toby reappeared he was accompanied by a note from a dr 
paul stamer declaring the robot to be in fine health 
but employees at the health clinic said stamer doesnt exist 
barclay said 
as christmas approached the barclays nearly decided to take 
toby home because of concerns that jodi would take him away for 
good during the holiday weekend they decided against it 
we dont want to interfere with their love life barclay 
said 
their trust was rewarded 
in a christmas card with the usual confessions of love from jodi 
and a message for barclay to look in an old car at his home 
inside the car was a plaster elephant painted gold barclay 
collects toy elephants and a 15pound ham with a tag wishing the 
couple merry christmas from jodi and toby

president bush welcomed news that gen manuel 
antonio noriega had sought asylum at the vatican mission in panama 
city declaring on christmas eve that the deposed dictators 
reign of terror is over 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said top bush 
administration deputies were meeting into the night at the white 
house considering an appropriate course of action for bringing 
him to justice 
us military officers meanwhile hoped noriegas action would 
take the spirit to resist out of loyalists still fighting in 
panama said a pentagon spokesman col miguel monteverde he said 
it was not clear whether the development would hasten the 
withdrawal of us troops 
under international law diplomatic missions are safe havens for 
those seeking asylum and noriega is not the only prominent figure 
to take advantage of this convention since june chinese dissident 
fang lizhi has kept chinese authorities at bay by taking refuge in 
the us embassy in beijing 
while fitzwater said the administration wants to bring noriega 
to justice he declined to say whether that would involve a us 
effort to gain custody of the general who is under indictment in 
the united states on drug trafficking charges 
sen jesse helms rnc said white house chief of staff john 
sununu told him strenuous negotiations with the vatican were 
ongoing 
us officials are pointing out that noriega is not there 
for political reasons he is as sununu told me a common 
criminal helms told the associated press 
i asked him if the prospects look good and he says they dont 
look bad because the church realizes how the people feel in 
panama helms said 
helms said sources in panama say that he noriega probably 
went in with the escort of a diplomat he is seeking to be 
permitted to leave and go to one of two or three counties 
including cuba 
earlier defense secretary dick cheney had said it was uncertain 
whether the united states would seek to try noriega or whether the 
new government in panama would deal with him 
the italian news agency ansa quoted the papal nuncio in panama 
city monsignor sebastiano laboa as indicating he would not hand 
over noriega to the united states or the usinstalled government 
in panama 
noriegas lawyer in miami raymond takiff said sunday that 
noriegas action surprised him i was sure hed die in panama 
us inability to capture noriega had become a sore point for 
the administration which earlier sunday fended off criticism that 
civil order in panama was being undermined by his continued freedom 
bush was at the presidential retreat at camp david when he got 
word sunday afternoon of noriegas request for asylum at the 
vatican mission in washington press secretary marlin fitzwater 
said on behalf of bush we have been notified by the papal nuncio 
in panama city that general noriega has turned himself in at their 
embassy 
i am pleased that the general is now under the control of 
diplomatic authorities his reign of terror is over said the 
statement as we work to help return law and order to panama 
city and as the government of president guillermo endara begins 
its work the demise of general noriega sends a strong signal that 
freedom and democracy in panama are on the rise 
earlier sunday bush had traveled to the pentagon for a briefing 
on panama developments and he dispatched defense secretary dick 
cheney to panama city just hours before noriegas asylum bid was 
disclosed 
archbishop marcos mcgrath of panama city asked by cbstv why 
noriega went to the vatican mission said apparently he decided 
that the moment had come to end his resistance and he made 
contacts by telephone and drove in a private car and walked into 
the papal nuncios residence and thereby entered into an area of 
diplomatic immunity 
apparently he went in alone and he would be out of the area of 
arrest either by the panamanian government authorities or any 
action of the us military the roman catholic archbishop said 
under diplomatic tradition noriega is safe from arrest as long 
as he remains inside the diplomatic mission or until agreement is 
reached on terms for him to leave the area of immunity 
at the state departments panama task force richard sanders 
said administration officials had not decided whether to take steps 
to bring noriega to the united states 
putting noriega on trial poses risks to the united states 
noriega formerly had an association with the central intelligence 
agency and might be in a position to disclose embarrassing details 
of that relationship in defending himself for trial he could seek 
to use classified documents in his defense 
us military officials had anticipated that noriega might seek 
diplomatic sanctuary and on thursday troops were sent to ring the 
panama city embassies of nicaragua and cuba 
top administration officials discussed the panama invasion on 
television interview shows sunday acknowledging that the 24000 
us soldiers now there still have a lot of work to do to 
restore order 
secretary of state james a baker iii and cheney defended the 
administration against criticism it had not acted quickly enough to 
quell looting in panama city after us troops invaded early 
wednesday 
us forces initially concentrated on military targets but are 
now working more with endaras government to restore order cheney 
said on abcs this week with david brinkley 
the looting is dying out said cheney he acknowledged that 
some pronoriega paramilitary forces known as dignity 
battalions were running loose in the streets but the 
situation appears to be steadily improving 
its not all over yet he said we still have a lot of 
work to do but clearly we are in better shape today than at any 
point since the effort started 
in a broadcast to us armed forces around the world bush said 
america has the strength to confront tyranny when we must gen 
noriega is the latest to learn that lesson 
bush told reporters outside the pentagon that the emphasis now 
is on cleaning up the last parts of resistance seeing that 
civilian government take over restoring tranquility in the city 
and then moving on food and medicine 
baker appearing on the nbctv program meet the press 
reiterated the administration position that the us troops will 
remain in panama as long as it takes to get the job done 
the pentagons casualty figures stood at 24 us servicemen 
killed in action 284 wounded and two civilian dependents killed 
earlier pentagon officials had said 25 us servicemen died but 
later reported that they had been counting one death twice 
casualties for the panamanian defense forces were 154 killed 
113 wounded and 2969 captured the pentagon reported 
additionally about 18000 weapons had been captured 
official tallies of panamanian civilian casualties were 
unavailable but the air force said a c5 cargo plane loaded with 
medical supplies was sent from south carolina to help treat injured 
civilians

barely a year ago state taxpayers were 
cashing preholiday rebate checks worth nearly 42 million but 
with the northeasts economy in a tailspin maine officials face 
spending cuts of half again that much 
while the officials say they hope to avoid any serious 
disruption in existing services or layoffs of state workers they 
acknowledge it otherwise may be impossible to achieve a 67 million 
reduction through mid1991 
the targeted amount represents 2 percent of the states 
twoyear 32 billion budget which by law must be balanced 
to assume that we can cut this level of dollars without some 
impact on services i think is unrealistic state finance 
commissioner h sawin millett said last week sooner or later 
you get into programs 
heads of state departments and agencies have until tuesday to 
propose the initial round of cuts for the rest of the fiscal year 
that started july 1 
gov john r mckernan who also has expanded a partial hiring 
freeze and called for cutbacks in state employees travel as part 
of the new austerity policy is expected to make the final 
decisions by midjanuary and present a budgetreduction bill to the 
legislature by the end of the month 
mckernan has ruled out any increase in the state income or sales 
taxes 
state executives said its too early to specify what cuts would 
be proposed 
were all scrambling said robert l woodbury chancellor of 
the sevencampus university of maine system 
at this point nothing is sacred said human services 
commissioner h rollin ives whose department administers most 
socialservice programs the last thing i want to do is cut 
essential existing services 
the pending cuts come in response to a sharp downturn in the 
economy that has caused budget problems of varying degrees for 
other states throughout the northeast following several years of 
robust growth in the mid1980s that growth generated such a 
windfall in maines incometax revenue that lawmakers voted last 
fall to return nearly 42 million in an electionyear rebate 
among the states worst off now is massachusetts which faces a 
fiscal year 1990 budget deficit that the administration of gov 
michael s dukakis estimates at more than 800 million dukakis has 
urged a tax increase by the end of the year but that prospect 
appears unlikely as lawmakers approach the end of this years 
session and the budget debate is expected to spill over into next 
years legislature 
in new hampshire gov judd gregg is forecasting a shortfall of 
30 million to 50 million gregg imposed a hiring freeze in 
october and is working with lawmakers to pare state spending by 
about 18 million for the biennium 
mckernans call for spending cuts in maine resulted from the 
second reduction this year in his administrations projections of 
salestax revenues following a review of state finances by an 
outside accounting firm 
the consultant concluded that the money generated by the 5 
percent state sales tax which is second only to the individual 
income tax in the amount of revenue generated should continue to 
grow in the months ahead but that the increases would be much 
smaller than anticipated sluggish sales of motor vehicles and 
building supplies have been cited as the chief reasons 
the governor ordered department heads to recommend spending cuts 
equal to 5 percent of their discretionary income for the six months 
left in this fiscal year and to revise their fiscal 1991 budgets to 
eliminate any growth 
those proposals are expected to yield about 94 million in 
potential cuts administration officials have said 
some agencies are expected to be affected more than others 
because mckernan has pledged to preserve critical services 
particularly those provided through the departments of mental 
health corrections and human services as much as possible 
the administrations consultant washingtonbased peat marwick 
main amp co has been contracted to help state officials devise a 
more reliable economic model to use in forecasting revenues 
clearly well be in better shape when we build the next 
budget said finance commissioner millett

while its not the first time a political 
figure has sought refuge in a vatican embassy roman catholic 
officials faced a unique dilemma when gen manuel antonio noriega 
showed up at the papal nunciate in panama 
helping the strongman flee the country would likely pique the 
united states which invaded panama last week to try to capture the 
strongman and bring him to trial on drug charges 
at the same time the vatican would not be eager to hand him 
over to us authorities for fear of appearing to condone the 
invasion and take sides in an international dispute 
its a very complex problem said a senior vatican official 
early today after learning that noriega took refuge sunday at the 
papal nunciate or vatican embassy in panama city 
the official who works in foreign policy issues and spoke under 
the usual ground rule of anonymity noted that the vatican has no 
tradition or policy of accepting asylum seekers 
the vatican policy is were not open to taking people we 
cant take them back to the vatican the vatican needs to 
negotiate with a third government to take them this is much more 
difficult the official said 
the official said the vatican mission could seek to turn noriega 
over to the new panama government or to arrange for safe passage to 
another country 
i dont think they could directly hand noriega over to the 
americans who are an invading army the official said they 
would be recognizing the americans as the local authorities 
instead they could hand him over to the government there on 
condition of a fair trial 
the official said noriega may have chosen to take refuge at the 
vatican embassy because he feels it offers the most guarantees and 
is the one mission whose diplomatic immunity the united states 
would not want to violate 
just two months ago the vatican embassy in panama had sheltered 
opposition leader guillermo endara after he was beaten by noriegas 
soldiers endara was later installed as president after the us 
invasion 
in 1983 four marxist guerrillas sought refuge at the vatican 
mission in santiago chile after they were accused by chilean 
authorities in the assassination of retired army gen carol urzua 
the governor of metropolitan santiago 
the holy see arranged for their safe conduct out of the country 
on grounds they would have faced summary judgment in chile by an 
army war tribunal 
another case of political refuge involving the vatican was that 
of the late hungarian cardinal josef mindszenty who was convicted 
of treason in 1949 in what was widely regarded as a rigged trial 
mindszenty was freed from prison by hungarian revolutionaries in 
1956 and took refuge in the us mission in budapest when soviet 
tanks crushed the uprising he left his asylum in 1971 under an 
agreement with the vatican and died in vienna in 1975 
pope john paul ii and the local roman catholic church have 
expressed concern about the us military intervention in panama 
on friday the pope said there have been clashes with innocent 
victims and grave discomforts to the population

a wave of cheers roared through the 
streets of the city as panamanians facing a grim christmas 
learned gen manuel antonio noriega had surfaced and was seeking 
political asylum 
some found it hard to believe noriega had gone to the vatican 
mission sunday afternoon but when the report was confirmed 
elation ruled in besieged panama city 
now we can have christmas said one man who grabbed a 
friend and hugged him i dont have a turkey in the house we 
dont even have any hamburger all we have is a can of sardines 
but what the hell 
people banged pots cheered and honked horns as they drove up 
and down streets which were barricaded and still littered and 
smoldering after days of looting 
the man has fallen he is gone exclaimed two young men who 
said they heard the report on the radio 
attention people of panama attention people of panama said 
one excited radio announcer there is a report that noriega has 
turned himself in if thats true there is a fat man that is going 
to be very happy tonight 
he was referring to newlyinstalled president guillermo endara 
at the vatican embassy a throng of people soon amassed and grew 
by the minute as the sun went down over the panama city waterfront 
for many the news provided a release for their hate 
lets go lynch that son of a bitch yelled a group of young 
men in a car 
another group smashed a pineapple with their shoes and cursed 
pineapple face as the hated dictator was often called because 
of his pockmarked face 
the capital of 1 million had faced a bleak christmas days of 
looting stripped stores bare and there was a shortage of food and 
items to buy for presents 
happy holidays to the people of panama said a european 
ambassador who was visiting the embassy he asked not to be further 
identified 
mission accomplished said a passing cab driver that 
coward 
is it true a woman asked people from her balcony she 
squealed with joy when told it was 
although there were 26000 us military personnel in panama 
trying to find the general an informed military source said 
noriega drove himself or was driven through the city to the embassy 
in an upper class shorefront neighborhood and entered the building 
alone 
there were no us troops around the twostory building and 
garden that occupy half a city block when noriega arrived at about 
3 pm 
since the us invasion last wednesday sent noriega into hiding 
us soldiers have surrounded the cuban libyan and nicaraguan 
embassies in the belief noriega would seek refuge in one of those 
countries 
after it was reported that noriega was inside the vatican 
embassy armored cars and dozens paratroopers ringed the site as a 
helicopter hovered overhead the crowd of several hundred was kept 
100 yards from the site 
newscasters issued calls on television for people to stay inside 
their homes and not take part in demonstrations because they might 
get in the way of us troops still looking for noriega loyalists 
the broadcasts reminded people that a curfew began at 6 pm 
although the curfew has been widely ignored the crowd began slowly 
to disperse after sunset

the romanian faithful today are 
celebrating the christmas miracle that freed them from a communist 
dictator who trampled religious freedoms and even kept christmas 
music off the radio 
there were so many years when i did not come to church for 
fear of the government said one worshiper victoria ionita on 
christmas eve now there is shooting in the streets but i come 
because of trust in god 
christmas music rang out sunday throughout romania for the first 
time since communists took over in 1947 
but fighting raged on between soldiers backing the provisional 
government and security forces loyal to dictator nicolae ceausescu 
who was ousted in a popular uprising friday and later arrested 
a few families carried freshly cut christmas trees through 
bucharest early sunday but sniper fire by ceausescu supporters 
quickly cleared the streets 
for many romanians ceausescus downfall was a christmas miracle 
from st dimitrius the 12th century holy man whose relics lay in 
the gilded and frescoed cathedral the deposed dictator wanted to 
destroy 
this was a painful reenactment of the bible said patriarch 
teoctist the graybearded pontiff of romanias orthodox church 
ceausescu was a follower of herod and when herod was seeking 
jesus christ he ordered the killing of many thousands of children 
on oct 26 the eve of st dimitrius day churchmen prayed for 
the overthrow of ceausescu it came they said as an answer to 
that prayer 
everybody believes that said teoctist with a sly smile 
dont forget we are believers 
outside the cathedral old couples and young men lighted candles 
and bowed a woman in a green coat letitia patrut spoke of 
students slain during the uprising who would miss christmas 
these young people how they sacrificed for us she said 
we must pray for these poor young people who defended the 
people 
one woman was so badly shaken she paused long moments between 
words she had fasted since friday night in sympathy for the 
victims to emphasize her point she fished from her pockets two 
bullets she had dug from her wall 
patriarch teoctist said romanians have remained a deeply 
religious people despite political adversity 
he said 85 percent to 90 percent of romanians are orthodox 
christians and that he was encouraged by how many people came to 
church during the dictatorship 
freedom of religion is indescribably important romanians 
lived all these years with their church and now they realize how 
they escaped from a nightmare the patriarch said 
he said ceausescu wanted to destroy the partriarchal residence 
and possibly even the cathedral every day i feared i would wake 
up and someone would tell me the bulldozers were coming

cheers from noriegas neighbors 
do you need anything do you want some ice ana julia real 
asked as she handed four quart bottles of cocacola over the high 
stone wall 
merry christmas a man called as he passed 
e4 greg frye of daltona fla passed the sodas around to the 
rest of his squad sweating in the tropical heat 
i try not to think about christmas because that just makes it 
harder he said but the moral support of the people has really 
helped 
sgt john stowe was one of the few who had planned to spend 
christmas in panama city but he thought it would be his hometown 
panama city fla 
instead of unwrapping christmas gifts he was cracking open 
boxes of g3 assault rifles at an arms cache 
he didnt seem to mind the cache was one of the biggest found 
so far 
at the international airport which us troops seized the first 
night of the invasion a group of soldiers sat around with their 
m16s singing christmas carols 
for some it was still a family christmas even though they were 
far from home

bit battered but still a happy sight to the dogs owners who were 
almost fleeced out of reward money offered for their pets return

the 300 reward money the caller said he would ship teddy bear 
home 
but when dean rider checked the address the man gave he learned 
it was a residential hotel that doesnt allow pets and there was 
no one registered there under the name given to rider 
but after they were the focus of a newspaper story about the 
incident the riders got another phone call this one legitimate 
an employee at the mission district animal shelter recognized 
the dog pictured in the newspaper story as one brought to the 
center after being hit by a car the good samaritan immediately 
called the riders 
hes got a big fat lip and a bruised hip a gash in his paw 
and an eye infection but he was wild with joy when he saw us

two police officers were on patrol when a man 
who looked like a haggard santa claus flagged them down from the 
side of the road saying he had something to give them 
the whitebearded man dressed in worn overalls and a thinning 
jacket led officers michael leonard and ed mcdaniel to his 
makeshift home a clapboard hideaway tucked beneath the stairwell 
of a warehouse and handed them two magnificently handcarved 
wooden toys 
i want you to give these to a boy and a girl who would 
otherwise not have a good christmas wayne miller 53 told the 
officers 
we were moved to tears leonard said friday as he recalled 
the recent encounter near the marine corps recruit depot he had 
several other toys in various stages of completion and he seemed 
very disappointed that those would not be ready for christmas 
miller revealed little about his personal life to the officers 
except that he has been living on the streets by his own choosing 
for 12 years one of the toys which he began carving last july 
was an auto that could double as a jewelry box because of its 
compartments the other was a tractortrailor loaded with logs 
he collected the materials to build the toys while digging 
through dumpsters for food and aluminum cans leonard said at 
night he carves the wood in front of his campfire 
leonard delivered the toys to the department of social services 
childrens center where assistant deputy director sherry paul 
promised that workers would deliver the gifts to a family by today 
the officers meanwhile started a collection to buy miller a 
sleeping bag or warm jacket despite millers insistence that hes 
doing fine

panamanians who held captive a cbs news producer 
and another american had hoped to use them to bargain for the 
release of troops captured by us servicemen the producer said 
the people who held the men for four days cried hysterically 
when freeing them saturday 33yearold jon meyersohn told a news 
conference sunday 
evidently they couldnt find anyone to negotiate with 
meyersohn said they didnt really know what to do with us they 
just knew they had a hot property 
meyersohn and doug mullen a gte executive were seized 
wednesday at the marriott hotel in panama city by paramilitary 
forces loyal to deposed strongman gen manuel antonio noriega they 
were released unharmed saturday 
at a news conference at cbs in new york meyersohn said he and 
mullen were tied up threatened and psychologically abused but were 
not physically harmed during their fourday ordeal 
he said his captors appeared disorganized and confused before 
surrendering to us embassy officials saturday afternoon 
everyone was in tears meyersohn said 
meyersohn said his captors armed with ak47 and m16 automatic 
rifles as well as hand grenades told them we just want people 
to understand what were going through tell the world we just want 
dignity we dont want to be a colonial nation 
at least 24 us servicemen have been killed and about 280 
injured since the united states invaded and occupied panama late 
tuesday and installed the civilian government of president 
guillermo endara 
just hours after meyersohns sunday news conference us 
officials announced noriega had turned himself in to the vatican 
mission in panama and requested political asylum 
meyersohn and mullen were abducted at about 9 am wednesday by 
members of noriegas socalled dignity battalions meyersohn said 
he mullen and two others were first driven to a panamanian defense 
forces building 
there were guns everywhere guns in our faces and we heard 
threats like were going to kill the gringos meyersohn said 
they were marched up six flights of steps ordered to sit with 
their hands on their heads and interrogated he said 
meyersohn said that at one point a captain of the panamanian 
defense forces took mullen and meyersohn aside and told them in 
english we need you as a hostage to bargain for 
the two americans were then tied up with their shoelaces taken 
back to the pickup truck made to lie beneath a tarpaulin and 
driven away later they were driven about 30 minutes into the 
countryside 
the americans were taken to three other locations including a 
jungle clearing where they were tied up on saturday they were 
taken to the apartment of a panamanian friend of mullen who 
negotiated their release 
meyersohn said that while in captivity he thought often of the 
15 hostages held in lebanon particularly about terry anderson the 
chief middle east correspondent for the associated press who has 
been held since 1985 
ill never look at a hostage situation in the same way 
again meyersohn said

the carolinas and parts of georgia had their first white 
christmas in at least a century and florida utility officials asked 
people not to use electric ovens to cook holiday turkeys today as a 
stubborn cold wave refused to ease 
temperatures in northern florida were lower than in anchorage 
alaska this morning 22 in jacksonville at 2 am est compared 
with 31 in anchorage 
one visitor to florida wasnt complaining 
this is nice its not christmas without some cold said 
louis dussault of montreal strolling in miami beach with his wife 
and two children 
florida gov bob martinez extended a state of emergency to 
today easing weight restrictions on roads and bridges to help 
growers move freezedamaged citrus and strawberry crops quickly 
there is no one smiling in florida agriculture today said 
roy parke of parkesdale farms in plant city selfproclaimed winter 
strawberry capital of the nation 
and though warmer weather creeped slowly eastward it was too 
late to prevent citrus crop devastation in the lower rio grande 
valley of texas where temperatures plunged to 11 degrees during 
the weekend temperatures hit the low 50s there sunday but dipped 
below freezing again this morning 
its going to take probably weeks and maybe months to 
determine how much damage weve had said richard hensz director 
of the texas aampi university citrus center in weslaco but its 
very extensive 
the arctic blast has left a trail of nearly 300 broken records 
from the canadian border to the gulf of mexico since friday the 
national weather service said it it has been blamed for at least 
83 deaths from the plains to the east coast since dec 15 
it was a painfully cold christmas for thousands of homeless in 
new york despite the efforts of volunteers infused with the 
holiday spirit an estimated 38000 homeless men women and 
children were expected to be without shelter today said peter 
smith president of partnership of the homeless a private shelter 
network he estimated new york citys homeless population at 82000 
across the nation smith estimated there are 720000 people 
without shelter 36 percent of the total 2 million homeless 
the cold combined with a lowpressure system off the 
midatlantic coast sunday to create blizzards in the carolinas 
drifts stood up to 8 feet high in south carolina and 
wilmington nc recorded its greatest snowfall ever 15 inches 
eclipsing the record of 12 inches on feb 910 1973 
the last white christmas in wilmington was in 1870 and for 
north carolinas outer banks it was 1874 along the georgia coast 
it was the first since at least 1871 the weather service said 
the blizzard caused a 600foot navy tanker to run aground on the 
outer banks no fuel spilled and nobody was injured 
the cold wave stranded travelers and overloaded power plants in 
florida 
transformers and electric cables overloaded despite rotating 
blackouts about 300000 of the 3 million customers of florida 
power amp light co were without power sunday some for more than 10 
hours said palm beach district manager bill ellis 
with many businesses and restaurants closed for the holiday 
utilities planned fewer blackouts overnight but slowcooking 
turkey dinners on christmas remained a problem said rick janka 
spokesman for florida power co on the gulf coast 
the christmas tree lights wont be too much of a problem now 
but we still have to conserve higher energy uses like dishwashers 
and ovens janka said 
among places recording temperatures in the single digits sunday 
were ocala fla athens atlanta and columbus ga and mobile 
ala 
floridas governor mobilized national guardsmen and other state 
workers to rescue motorists from gridlocked icy highways 
but warmer weather in the midwest began moving eastward 
temperatures rose to 40 at chamberlain sd and into the 20s in 
minneapolis after nearly five straight days below zero

marilyn quayle said rape victims should be 
allowed to abort a pregnancy and in such cases she supported use 
of a french morning after pill 
the use of the pill known as ru486 has been strongly fought in 
the united states by antiabortion groups 
mrs quayle wife of vice president dan quayle made her 
comments in an interview sunday on the use of a pill her 
statements apparently contradict comments she made on the issue 
last week 
mrs quayle said in a letter thursday to john c willke 
president of the national right to life committee i do not 
support any medical procedures or pills other than those that 
actually prevent pregnancy 
willke wrote her asking for a clarification of her position on 
the issue 
in the letter it was not clear whether she was referring to 
contraceptive pills or other pills including ru486 
i think that anyone who is raped should report it absolutely 
immediately and every step should be taken to insure that a 
pregnancy has not occurred mrs quayle told the daily news 
something like the french morning after pill if proven 
effective would be very appropriate and would lessen the 
psychological trauma of a rape victim she said 
ru486 is a synthetic chemical that causes an abortion by 
inducing the uterus to expel the egg

ernest morial new orleans first black mayor 
who spent a lifetime breaking down racial barriers has died from 
an apparent heart attack after leaving a christmas party he was 60 
morial was found slumped over the steering wheel of his car at 
11 pm saturday after leaving a party said jinx broussard a 
spokeswoman for mayor sidney barthelemy morial apparently had 
suffered a heart attack 
he was taken to mercy hospital where efforts to revive him 
failed and was pronounced dead at 130 am sunday broussard said 
the feisty attorney became the citys first black mayor in 1978 
at a ceremony loaded with symbols of blackwhite unity and tough 
promises 
he served two terms leaving office in 1986 after an 
unsuccessful attempt to persuade voters to amend the city charter 
to allow him a third consecutive term he then practiced law 
becoming mayor wasnt the only time he achieved a first for 
blacks 
he was the first black graduate from louisiana state university 
law school in 1954 he was the first black assistant us attorney 
in louisiana serving from 1965 to 1967 he became the first black 
louisiana legislator in modern times serving in the house from 
1967 to 1970 when he was appointed to a juvenile court judgeship 
in 1973 he was the first black elected to the louisiana 4th 
circuit court of appeal 
he also was a president of the national conference of mayors a 
democratic national committee member and an adviser to democratic 
presidential candidate michael dukakis in 1988 
moon landrieu who was mayor from 1970 to 1978 said sunday that 
morial was a formidable leader who left his mark on city state and 
national politics 
im satisfied that when youre the first of anything youre 
long remembered for that dutch was the first black individual to 
achieve high public office in this state that alone i think is 
a very significant achievement landrieu said 
i think he will also be remembered for his tenacity and 
pugnaciousness he was certainly controversial and i think will be 
remembered for that also and very fondly by some 
morial was born ernest nathan morial on oct 9 1929 a son of a 
new orleans cigar maker morial later had his name changed to make 
his nickname dutch his second middle name 
he was really an extraordinary individual said arnold 
hirsch a professor of history and urban studies at the university 
of new orleans 
if theres one thing that constantly comes to mind about 
morial it was his dogged refusal to accept any of the barriers 
that were laid in his way 
morials public service career was launched in the 1960s when he 
became president of the local chapter of the national association 
for the advancement of colored people 
he had his signature on almost every case that began to 
dismantle the edifice of jim crow here brick by brick hirsch 
said 
at a speech in 1967 morial said new orleans wont have the 
kind of political climate it takes to elect a negro mayor for eight 
or 10 years he was elected 10 years later 
as mayor morial dealt with floods in 1978 a city police strike 
in 1979 that effectively shut down mardi gras and the 1984 
louisiana world exposition that was a financial disaster 
when voters rejected a charter change that would have allowed 
him to run for a third term morial backed sen bill jefferson to 
succeed him but jefferson was defeated by sidney barthelemy a 
former state legislator and councilman barthelemy is up for 
reelection in february 1990 
morial had been considering running against barthelemy and 
challenger donald mintz but two weeks ago he said the demands on 
his family would be too great 
survivors include his wife sybil and five children 
morial will lie in state wednesday at gallier hall in new 
orleans a prayer service is scheduled that evening in municipal 
auditorium 
a funeral mass will be said thursday at historic st louis 
cathedral in the french quarter burial will be in st louis 
cemetery no 1

about 2000 opposition supporters marched 
downtown today in a noisy but peaceful demonstration on 
constitution day to demand swifter political reform 
about 2000 riot policemen backed by water cannon trucks guarded 
the national assembly building from behind barbedwire barricades 
earlier 11 legislators from the opposition democratic 
progressive party scuffled with guards at the national assembly who 
tried to prevent them from carrying protest banners into the 
building 
three assemblymen said they suffered bruises in the brief 
scuffle before they were allowed to take the banners into the 
national assembly where president lee tenghui appealed for greater 
tolerance toward dissent 
in a more open society we need to have the magnanimity to 
tolerate dissent lee told the assembly as our society faces a 
transition we need to build a new political culture and strengthen 
psychological reconstruction 
as lee and premier lee huan addressed the assembly taiwans 
electoral college the opposition assemblymen unfurled their 
banners which demanded aging assemblymen step down we want 
universal suffrage for the presidency and please proclaim 
taiwan an independent state 
both the nationalist government in taiwan and the rival 
communist government in beijing are opposed to independence for 
taiwan which they say is a chinese province both say they are the 
sole legitimate government of all china and beijing has indicated 
it may use force to prevent taiwan from gaining independence 
the 780member national assembly which meets every six years to 
elect the president is dominated by aging members many in their 
70s who were elected on the chinese mainland before the 
nationalists fled to taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to the 
communists 
most of the aged assemblymen are nationalist supporters and they 
have been frozen in office to support the nationalist claim to be 
the legitimate government of china 
the opposition has demanded the retirement of the aged 
assemblymen the government has offered them handsome pensions if 
they step down but has refused to force them to retire 
the old members did not face reelection for 40 years and 
they cannot represent taiwanese people said chou chingyu a 
democratic progressive party assemblywoman they dont have the 
right to elect our president 
lee who is expected to be reelected president in march told 
opposition assemblymen at a meeting last week that political 
reforms must be introduced slowly to maintain taiwans stability

a trail through aptos canyon has become a 
tourist attraction drawing hundreds of hikers eager to stand at 
ground zero of the deadly and devastating october earthquake 
its awfully crowded its swamped said senior park aide 
barbara louck on sunday adding that the crunch of curious 
sightseers were creating problems for parking and access to the 
sixmile roundtrip trail 
its an exciting place to be said bud getty superintendent 
of forest of nisene marks state park this was the major quake of 
peoples lifetimes and it really captures your imagination to walk 
out to the epicenter you can really see the power of the earth 
a sign posted by ranger jerry waggoner marks the spot about 50 
miles south of san francisco that was calculated by latitude and 
longitude the site has 4footdiameter redwood trees snapped off 
at the ground and a 150foot wide landslide nearby just beyond 
the epicenter the trail is closed because of danger from new 
landslides 
thats enough to convince me said pat wagner 62 of 
burlington iowa ive never been in an earthquake and i never 
want to be 
can you imagine what it took to rip these trees out asked 
julie dawson of milpitas during a hike to the epicenter last week 
and can you imagine the sound it made snap crackle and pop 
dawson said she understands why the previously obscure park site 
has become so popular since the 71magnitude on oct 17 that 
killed 67 people and resulted in 10 billion in damage 
i stayed away from san francisco because i didnt want to be a 
rubble necker i wouldnt want that in my neighborhood she said 
but theres no one to bother out here 
the walk to the site takes about an hour most of the trail is 
in a deep forest where sunlight rarely penetrates 
in addition to nisene park other san francisco bay area 
locations are experiencing renewed interest from temblor tourists 
at point reyes national seashore the 06mile earthquake trial 
leads to the epicenter of the 1906 san francisco quake and visitors 
can see a fence displaced by fault movement of 16 to 20 feet 
and in hollister meeting place of the san andreas calaveras 
and hayward faults a selfguided earthquake walk wanders past 
curbs offset by fault creep and buildings damaged in the oct 17 
earthquake

the soviet communist party leadership met today to 
deal with the lithuanian partys unprecedented declaration of 
independence from the kremlin 
lithuanian communists voted wednesday at a special congress in 
vilnius to form their own party rejecting appeals for unity from 
president mikhail s gorbachev and other top soviet officials 
staterun radio moscow reported that the national partys 
policymaking central committee convened in moscow to consider 
the situation in the lithuanian party branch 
the lithuanians break is serious because it is without 
precedent in the history of the party founded by vladimir i lenin 
who demanded and forged a unitary party across the entire territory 
of the soviet union lithuanian reformers predict local party 
organizations in many of the other 14 constituent soviet republics 
may follow suit 
algirdas brazauskas the lithuanian party leader said the 
break which included drafting a separate party program was 
necessary for lithuanian communists to compete successfully in 
local elections feb 24 
however lithuanian communists who opposed the break formed 
their own leadership and pledged continuing loyalty to moscow 
the national party leadership invited both brazauskas and the 
leaders of the antiseparatist faction to moscow to attend todays 
meeting radio moscow said

us troops and armored vehicles 
ringed the vatican embassy early today after deposed strongman gen 
manuel antonio noriega took refuge there and asked for political 
asylum 
american troops captured the town of santiago southwest of 
panama city but otherwise fighting died down as christmas came to 
panama 
about 40 soldiers kept watch in the predawn darkness as a 
helicopter its running lights turned off landed several times 
across the street from the vatican embassy then took off the 
chopper was not seen picking up or dropping off anyone 
the vatican in its first official statement on the situation 
said today that noriega took refuge in the embassy sunday after 
expressing the will to end the conflict between his supporters 
and the united states 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said it was too early to say 
if noriega would be handed over to the united states where he 
faces drug charges or given passage to another country 
under international law embassies are sacrosanct ground and 
us troops cannot legally enter the papal embassy to arrest 
noriega 
earlier an official at the vatican said he doubted the embassy 
would immediately turn noriega over to the united states 
panamanians banged pots and pans and cheered when word of 
noriegas surrender spread through the capital littered with glass 
and looted bare after five days of fighting 
the american invasion which began at midnight tuesday has 
killed at least 23 american soldiers and two american civilians 
and nearly 300 panamanians according to us figures announced 
today many panamanian victims are believed to be civilians 
lt col jerry murguia told reporters at a southern command 
briefing today that american troops had captured santiago 120 
miles southwest of panama city taking 188 prisoners and seizing 
several hundred small arms 
it was a quiet night thats the good news he said 
there was little else to celebrate in this mainly roman catholic 
country 
what am i going to tell my 6yearold daughter i cannot tell 
her santa claus was killed by a bomb said one woman in a 
middleclass neighborhood christmas eve 
residents roamed their neighborhoods cleaned glass and trash 
off streets and put up christmas lights 
noriega drove himself or was driven to the embassy in a car at 
about 3 pm sunday an informed military source said none of the 
26000 american troops searching for noriega in this central 
american country was at the embassy at the time 
american soldiers had surrounded the nicaraguan and cuban 
embassies after rumors noriega might seek refuge there 
navarro rejected the idea the vatican was embarrassed by 
noriegas decision to seek refuge at its embassy and depicted it as 
an opportunity to bring peace to the country 
i can announce with satisfaction that the conflict in panama 
seems to be nearing a solution without further shedding of blood 
he said in a fourparagraph statement and this is good news for 
christmas day 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the united states 
would continue to seek ways to bring noriega to the united states 
asked if anyone would get the 1 million reward the bush 
administration offered for noriegas capture fitzwater said no 
i dont think so 
gen maxwell thurman chief of the us southern command said 
he ordered the vatican embassy surrounded after noriegas surrender 
to prevent noriega supporters from blowing into the place i 
would not want them to come with an armored car and blow their way 
into the embassy 
noriega surfaced a few hours after three highranking members of 
his defense forces surrendered and another pledged loyalty to the 
usbacked government 
witnesses said they saw several noriega officials including 
former acting president manuel solis palma entering the embassy 
the italian news agency ansa reported from panama city that 32 
people had sought asylum from the vatican including high officials 
of the panamanian defense forces and political parties of the 
noriega regime 
panamanians cheered as word spread that noriega had turned 
himself in hundreds congregated at the embassy 
the man has fallen he is gone some shouted 
a radio station went on the air with a nationalistic song called 
patria fatherland written and sung by panamanian ruben 
blades 
now we can have christmas said one man in panama city as he 
grabbed a friend and hugged him i dont have a turkey in the 
house we dont even have any hamburger all we have is a can of 
sardines but what the hell 
food and medical supplies were in short supply and stores were 
ransacked by looters 
combat from noriega loyalists dwindled sunday but there was 
fighting in the workingclass san miguelito district one of those 
where the pronoriega paramilitary dignity battalions are strongest 
thurman estimated the battalions number about 1800 they have 
been joined by an unknown number of noriegas original 
15000member defense forces 
murguia said today that 23 us soldiers had been killed and 285 
wounded since the invasion began the pentagon on sunday said 25 
us soldiers were killed it then changed that figure to 24 
saying one death had been counted twice 
murguia in announcing his figures said two deaths were counted 
twice 
the latest figures no longer listed a soldier as missing 
pentagon officials also said two american civilians had been 
killed 
murguia said 290 enemy troops had been killed 121 wounded 
and 3780 captured it was not clear whether the figures included 
both defense forces and dignity brigade personnel 
dr elmer miranda director of santo tomas hospital put the 
panamanian death toll at 260 and said many victims were civilians

long on these airlines 
the smokers guide to smokers flights in the nordic area 
lists flights by other airlines with smoking sections that have 
stopovers in the region 
to get to copenhagen from helsinki the pamphlet says a 
traveler can fly pan am to stockholm and transfer to a soviet 
aeroflot aircraft to the danish capital a heavy smoker might have 
time for two cigarettes on each leg 
finnair claims it was the first airline to introduce nonsmoking 
seats more than 20 years ago 
smokepeace which adopted the symbol of an indian in feathered 
headdress puffing a peace pipe says it just wants a fair deal for 
smokers and nonsmokers 
in 10 months it has drawn 1500 members some are nonsmokers 
offended by discrimination oste said and 53 percent are women 
smokers have to back down a bit so as not to harm or irritate 
nonsmokers said oste an anchorman for swedish tv news who says 
he has been a pipe smoker for 45 years 
at the same time fair provision should be made for smokers he 
said too often company managers and politicians are making 
decisions without asking workers oste said 
henry launched two years ago by a danish wine and tobacco 
merchant enlisted denmarks pipesmoking foreign minister uffe 
ellemannjensen in an advertising campaign last spring to plead 
that tolerance and consideration are the basis of living 
together 
although it doesnt release financial figures henry reportedly 
gets part of its finances from the danish tobacco industry 
norway has enacted some of the worlds toughest antismoking 
laws which critics say make lighting a cigarette indoors illegal 
almost everywhere except at home 
swedens parliament is in the early stage of drafting a new 
comprehensive law which many legislators want to fashion on the 
norwegian model steps toward a similar bill in denmark were 
interrupted by an election and have been dropped for now 
among norways regulations is a ban on smoking in any office 
occupied by more than one person even if everyone in the room is a 
smoker 
smoking was outlawed in schools hospitals theater lobbies and 
public transportation selling tobacco to youths under 18 is 
illegal 
many scandinavian hotels have nosmoking rooms and some have 
barred tobacco from entire floors 
most work places have set aside smoking areas the stockholm 
daily aftonbladet banned smoking anywhere in its new ninestory 
building except in a few glassedin rooms by the coffee machines on 
each floor they are so poorly ventilated that workers refer to 
them as the gas chambers 
high tobacco taxes also are meant to deter in norway cigarettes 
cost about 4 a pack slightly more than in the other countries 
rollyourown tobacco is becoming more popular in denmark where 
pipe tobacco has less tax 
one dodge from smoking bans is snuff a plug of tobacco that 
many scandinavians stick under their upper lip 
the government in oslo adopted an ambitious and critics say 
unrealistic target of making norway smokefree by the end of the 
century 
the critics note that although tobacco has not been advertised 
since 1973 four out of 10 norwegians smoke and consumption is 
rising by 500 tons of tobacco a year 
the other governments have gone no farther than to endorse the 
world health organizations goal to reduce smoking by 25 percent in 
the next 10 years

a 41yearold businessman fought for 
four months to get his 11400 speeding fine reduced to 1050 but 
he still says finlands traditional system of punishment based on a 
persons wealth is fair 
police in august nabbed rainer rooth for driving his bmw 75 mph 
in a 50 mph zone and tax authorities set the 11400 fine based on 
his 1987 income 
penalties for exceeding the speed limit by more than 10 mph are 
based on what the offender says is his annual income the minimum 
is 5 
the principle of paying fines according to earnings has been 
around for years and finns say the fine is the fairest way to 
punish offenders even rooth who may have received the highest 
fine on record doesnt argue with it 
i think the system is just but there has to be some kind of 
limit said rooth who built a tourist attaction based on the 
wild west 
when ticketed rooth told police he was getting no income from 
his business which was heavily in debt 
the case went to the tax authorities who ruled that rooths 
earnings in 1987 was roughly 300000 and set the fine at 11400 
rooth protested and the case was twice adjourned 
i didnt earn that kind of money when the offense occurred 
rooth said in an interview 
on wednesday the court reduced the fine to 1050 rooth 
estimated he paid at least 3000 with legal costs included 
i tell you the taxman was after me its as simple as that 
the new fine is still not right but i can live with it another 
appeal would probably cost just as much he said 
kauko aromaa a justice minstry researcher said the system of 
fines based on income was a just way to punish people 
the dayfine is at most onethird of an offenders daily 
income based on gross annual earnings the number of dayfines an 
offender is given is determined by the severity of the offense 
rooth was given 27 dayfines for his highspeed driving 
in 1987 the dayfine system was used in 350000 cases ranging 
from traffic offenses burglaries drunken driving embezzlement 
and assault 
police admit the system has flaws 
sure we know that most of those we stop in a speed trap lie 
about their pay but we cant check them all but mostly if they 
make it credible enough we wont doubt it said antti kivela 
duty officer at the helsinki traffic police department 
obviously when someone who drives a big bmw says he doesnt 
have a source of income we are going to suspect something that 
guy was asking for it kivela said of rooth 
kivela said that the average speeding fine around helsinki is 
from 120 to 240 but 1000 fines were not uncommon 
in a widely publicized case last year a northern court rejected 
as too low the fine given to matti ahde who was then parliament 
speaker 
a quick check found that he lied about his income 
sure theres a loophole in the system it is almost as if we 
are challenging people to give wrong information because its not a 
crime to lie about your income to the police said aromaa

the army monday ordered the courtmartial of an 
israeli colonel accused of telling troops to break the bones of 20 
bound and gagged palestinian prisoners 
col yehuda meir will be the highest ranking officer to face 
trial during the 2yearold palestinian uprising against israeli 
occupation and the proceedings are expected to touch off debate 
over the militarys orders concerning the beating of palestinians 
in related developments monday a pathologist disclosed that a 
palestinian prisoner died while in the custody of the secret 
police and the military said an israeli coronel would be indicted 
for a shooting in which a 15yearold palestinian was killed 
the army announcement to prosecute meir came one day after the 
supreme court overturned the militarys decision not to press 
charges the announcement gave no date for the trial 
meir was reprimanded by lt gen dan shomron the armed forces 
chief of staff for the january 1988 incident and given the choice 
of leaving the army or standing trial meir the former military 
commander in the occupied west bank city of nablus resigned in 
april 
the armys chief prosecutor brig gen amnon straschnow had 
argued that meirs dismissal from the army was adequate punishment 
and trying the coronel would be difficult because the armys orders 
on the use of force were foggy 
testimony in trials of other soldiers showed that at the time 
army orders allowed soldiers to beat stonethrowers to deter 
further acts the orders have since been changed to ban such 
beatings 
the independent maariv newspaper quoting military sources said 
straschnow may resign after the supreme court rejected his decision 
and accepted the appeal by four palestinians and the association 
for civil rights in israel 
justice yaakov kadmi wrote that meirs orders to beat 
palestinian detainees stands in complete contradiction to the 
basic foundations of the nation of israel 
meir is accused of ordering troops to beat and break the legs of 
20 bound and gagged palestinians from the nearby towns of hawara 
and beita 
soldiers under his command left beaten and bound palestinians in 
a field until other arabs arrived and rushed then to a hospital 
he was also investigated in connection with an incident in which 
troops beat two palestinian teenagers in nablus the incident was 
filmed by a us television crew 
the military disclosed monday that straschnow decided last week 
to indict an unidentified colonel for firing plastic bullets in 
violation of army orders and fatally wounding a 15yearold gazan 
five months ago 
also monday pathologist michael baden said a prisoner from the 
occupied gaza strip died from internal bleeding caused by blows to 
the abdomen 
baden who works for the new york city police department was 
called as an independent investigator by the family of khaled kamel 
sheikh ali ali 27 was found dead dec 19 in his prison cell 
while in the custody of the shin bet secret service 
baden questioned five shin bet investigators who were involved 
in alis interrogation israel radio said

president corazon aquino called on 
filipinos in a christmas message to join together to help the 
country recover from the most recent coup attempt thousands of 
people lighted candles in a plea for peace 
the candles we will be lighting as one symbolize the longing 
of the ordinary citizen for peace and tranquility and his 
repudiation of violence as an instrument of power the manila 
chronicle said in a frontpage editorial 
mrs aquino said the dec 19 coup attempt tarnished the 
countrys reputation and stalled efforts to improve the economy 
still suffering from 20 years of rule under former president 
ferdinand marcos 
what we need to do today is to join hands so that we can 
regain the momentum that we lost so that we can heal the wounds 
that were inflicted upon us mrs aquino said 
marcos was ousted in a february 1986 militarycivilian uprising 
that propelled mrs aquino to power marcos died in september in 
exile in hawaii 
in another statement monday the central committee of the banned 
communist party of the philippines blamed the december coup attempt 
on mrs aquinos failure to solve the countrys economic social 
and political problems 
the party claimed the country was drifting toward a new era of 
repression because of the growing influence of the military faction 
that has quelled six coup attempts during the aquino administration 
the december coup try was the worst leaving at least 113 people 
dead 
the recent upsurge of popular unrest owing to the worsening 
political and economic crisis the military rebellion in december 
and the shameless manner in which the aquino regime asked for us 
succor to quell the rebellion have dramatically exposed its 
ineptitude to rule the party said in a statement distributed to 
news organizations 
the statement was issued to mark the 21st anniversary of the 
communist party of the philippines founded dec 26 1968 
thousands of candles flickered in front of homes businesses and 
military camps across the politically troubled land 
the nationwide candlelighting ceremony was organized by 
entertainer danny javier in a bid to forge national unity in the 
wake of the coup and amid insurgencies by marxist and moslem rebels 
people were urged to place one candle in front of their home for 
each member of the household as a gesture of peace and national 
reconciliation hundreds of thousands of filipinos also crowded 
churches in asias only predominately christian country to pray for 
peace 
in his christmas message roman catholic cardinal jaime l sin 
said violence had drowned out the song of peace and good will 
that was sung by the heavenly choir over bethlehem on that first 
christmas

along with late greeting cards and christmas 
bills more than 107 million american households will get unwelcome 
mail from the internal revenue service starting tuesday their 
annual tax forms 
the mass mailing of tax packages which carries a 26 million 
pricetag for printing and postage is conducted every year 
immediately after christmas 
some taxpayers may already have received their forms because 
their local postmaster jumped the gun the forms have been sitting 
in post offices with irs instructions not to mail them until after 
christmas but every year some postmasters send them early anyway 
in an effort to reassure jittery taxpayers officials are 
stressing that the forms contain few changes but much to the 
chagrin of the irs one of the changes should not have been made 
the problem involves the catastrophic health program which 
congress voted to repeal in november after a revolt among the 
elderly who would have had to foot the bill the wealthiest senior 
citizens would have faced an added tax burden of 800 
the tax liability was abolished along with the decision to scrap 
the program however the congressional action came too late to 
change the tax forms which were printed up in october with 
outdated information about the now obsolete tax 
the irs hopes to keep confusion to a minimum with a publicity 
campaign also no form exists for taxpayers to compute their 
liability under the catastrophic program 
if some taxpayers still fail to receive the word and include an 
amount on the line for the medicare premium the irs says it will 
refund the money irs official arthur altman estimated 12 million 
elderly taxpayers could be led astray 
the irs said this years forms which should be in most homes 
before new years day will offer relatively minor changes 
among them 
the personal exemption the amount you may exempt from 
taxation for yourself your spouse and each dependent increases to 
2000 per person up from 1950 last year 
the standard deduction claimed by people who do not itemize 
rises to 3100 for a single person up from 3000 last year 
while the exemption for a couple increases to 5200 up from 
5000 last year 
tax rates remain the same at 15 percent 28 percent and 33 
percent but the tax brackets have been widened so that more income 
will be taxed at a lower rate thus compensating for the impact of 
inflation 
bowing to the increase in separate last names for husband and 
wife the irs for the first time will include two lines instead of 
one so that spouses filing a joint return can enter their names 
and social security numbers on separate lines 
taxpayers must show the social security number for any 
dependent they claim who is age 2 or older last year the cutoff 
was age 5 
families with income as high as 19340 may qualify for an 
earnedincome credit up from a limit of 18576 last year 
in one of the few changes with an adverse impact only 20 
percent of interest paid on credit card debt auto loans and other 
personal debt will be deductible on 1989 returns down from 40 
percent last year 
the tax forms must be filed this year by april 16 one day later 
than normal because april 15 falls on a sunday 
the irs expects about 1112 million individual income tax 
returns will be filed for the 1989 tax year the majority of 
taxpayers 65 percent will end up using the comprehensive form 
1040 designed for taxpayers who itemize or who have incomes above 
50000 annually 
the rest who do not itemize and meet other qualifications can 
file the more simple form 1040a or the simplest of all the 
nineline form 1040ez the form a taxpayer receives in the mail is 
based on the form the taxpayer used last year 
all the tax forms come with a pitch from new irs commissioner 
fred t goldberg jr urging taxpayers to consider filing their 
returns electronically 
offered this year for the first time nationwide electronic 
filing features the advantage of cutting down the time required to 
process refund checks to three weeks compared to the normal six to 
10 weeks 
in 1988 twothirds of all taxpayers qualified for a refund with 
the average refund totaling 875 
the irs hopes that 2 million taxpayers will file their returns 
electronically this year and it is providing a toll free telephone 
number 18004241040 for people to call for a list of tax 
preparers in their area who have the capability of filing returns 
electronically

the vaticans official english translation 
of the annual christmas day message urbi et orbi to the 
city and to the world from pope john paul ii 
he gave power to become children of god john 112 today 
is the solemnity of christmas the eyes of our soul see the child 
laid in the manger 
the gaze of our faith rests upon the words of the prologue of 
john to all who received him he gave the power to become 
children of god 
we bless you son of man who are the eternal word 
glory to the father who has given you his onlybegotten to us 
glory to the spirit who proceeds from the father and from you o 
son of god 
glory to the ageless mystery which embraces all things 
in this night that mystery has drawn close to mankind it has 
entered mankinds life and history it has passed the threshold of 
our human existence 
the child wrapped in swaddling clothes and laid in a manger the 
helpless human child and at the same time the power which 
transcends all that man is all that he can accomplish for man 
cannot become like god through his own efforts as history has 
made clear from the beginning 
and yet man can become like god through gods own power this 
power is in the son the eternal word who became flesh and dwelt 
among us john 114 
today is the first day of his sojourn in our midst 
he was in the world and the world was made through him yet 
the world knew him not he came to his own home but his own people 
received him not 
but to all who received him he gave power to beome children 
of god who were born of god john 11013 
history continues on its way countless men and women nations 
peoples languages races cultures millions upon millionsyet 
he is unique laid now as a child in the manger there was no 
room in the inn and later upon the cross he and none other 
and then risen he and none other 
how many have received him not how many still receive him not 
how many know of him how many do not 
we would like to measure with human statistics how far this 
power reaches the power which is in him born crucified risen 
we would like to know humanly speaking how many have become 
in him and through him children of god children in the son 
but human measurements cannot fathom the mystery of god 
they cannot fathom the gift of gods birth present in the 
history of mankind present in the history of the world at work in 
human souls through the power of the spirit the giver of life 
all the ends of the earth have seen the victory of our god 
psalms 983 
yes the shepherds of bethlehem came and they saw 
yes the wise men from the east came and they saw 
and the aged simeon and the prophetess anna saw in the temple 
at jerusalem 
just how do the ends of the earth see you o word incarnate 
because you are for everyone the salvation of our god is for 
everyone and it comes through you

of the truth 1 tm 24 
truth is through you and grace as well you are the truth you 
are the way and the life cf john 146 and even though your own 
people received you not even though there was not room for you 
at the inn in you god has received god has received each 
one of us 
in you god has received us as well the men and women of the 
second millenium now hastening to its end 
he has not regarded our contradictions our infidelities our 
inconsistencies 
indeed he has sent you his word to heal us of them to tell 
us that by taking the road we are taking we are racing towards 
selfdestruction 
the world longs for peace yet every day our brothers and 
sisters are dying in the present conflicts in lebanon in the holy 
land in central america they are dying in fratricidal struggles 
for supremacy racial ideological economic they are dying 
because of senseless and reckless courses of action 
the world longs for reconciliation yet every day thousands of 
refugees are abandoned and rejected ethnic and religious 
minorities go neglected in their basic needs whole groups are kept 
on the margins of society in evergrowing isolation 
the world longs for balance both within and without yet every 
day the environment becomes more polluted for reasons of 
selfinterest or from lack of concern 
the message of truth and grace which comes to us at christmas 
through you must touch each of us that message is for us because 
you have come for us you have become one of us make us receive 
you o eternal word of the father 
may the world receive you awaken in hearts the rejection of all 
barriers be they of race ideology or intolerance guide the 
negotiations now under way for arms reduction and control 
strengthen all who strive for an end to the hostilities that 
have continued for all too long in africa and in asia so that the 
peoples involved may regain their freedom and their rights through 
frank and trusting dialogue 
and may this old europe of ours also receive you o word 
incarnate deep within her she carries the imprint of your gospel 
from which she has derived her culture her art her concept of the 
inviolable dignity of man 
may this europe open her doors and her heart to understand and 
receive the anxieties the fears and the problems of the nations 
which seek her help 
may she respond with the strength and the generosity of her 
christan roots to this very special moment of history a true 
kairos of gods providence which the world is now experiencing 
as if awakened from a nightmare and opened up to a better hope 
in particular bless at this hour o lord the noble land of 
romania which is celebrating this christmas in fear and trembling 
with sorrow for the many human lives tragically lost and in the joy 
of having taken once more the path of freedom 
brothers and sisters present here brothers and sisters

iran released 50 ailing or disabled iraqi 
prisoners of war monday to red cross representatives as a gesture 
of good will tehran radio reported 
it was not clear whether iraq would reciprocate and release some 
of the iranian pows it holds an earlier attempt to arrange a 
formal swap collapsed 
the radio said the prisoners were released in tehran to the red 
cross for eventual repatriation 
tehran radio monitored in cyprus quoted a foreign ministry 
statement as saying the 50 were freed on humanitarian grounds and 
in response to a request by un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar 
it did not say when perez de cuellar made the appeal but 
baghdad last week sent a memorandum to the un chief expressing 
concern over pows in iran after a red cross report on dec 6 that 
22 iraqis have died in jail 
the deaths were attributed to heart attacks and relevant 
diseases but iraqi media suggested the prisoners might have been 
tortured to death 
the red cross has registered 50000 prisoners held by iran and 
more than 19200 in iraqi camps united nations officials and 
diplomats estimate the two sides hold about 100000 pows between 
them 
the red cross secured an agreement to repatriate ailing 
prisoners immediately after a unceasefire halted the war on 
aug20 1988 the deal collapsed after the repatriation of only 400 
disabled and wounded prisoners with both sides accusing each other 
of falsifying the number of captives seeking asylum 
angelo gnadinger middle east chief for the red cross visited 
tehran and baghdad last week seeking a swap of the remaining 1000 
wounded and disabled pows held by both sides 
the mediation collapsed mainly because tehran insisted the 
exchange be coupled with a withdrawalof iraqi forces from chunks of 
land they occupied in the final weeks of the war 
unsponsored peace talks have been deadlocked mainly over the 
troop withdrawal issue and iraqs demand for redrawing the border 
to give it full sovereignty over the shattalarab waterway 
the channel a confluence of the great tigris and euphrates 
rivers is iraqs sole outlet to the persian gulf before the war 
the border ran down the middle of shattalarab

back in washington the brass was saying 
how the landing zone was clear not a hot lz at all thanks 
to the proficiency of new stealth fighter planes but the gis on 
the ground told a different story 
excited from their first taste of combat the soldiers described 
how one paratrooper was shot in the door of his c130 aircraft as 
he prepared to jump his ranger comrades had to pull him back to 
save his life 
a little incident among many demonstrating anew the primary law 
of conflict even in a little war the truth is an early casualty 
the pentagon said that forces defending this panamanian army 
compound were quickly subdued because us stealth jets slipped 
past radar and bombed a nearby field to provide a distraction yet 
us paratroopers who took this panamanian army compound said they 
landed amid an intense firefight which claimed several american 
lives and more than a dozen us wounded

near panama city was the witch house a modest residence 
where manuel noriega was said to have kept his four brazilian 
voodoo witches 
soldiers said they apparently just missed getting the witches 
themselves when they crashed into the house during wednesdays 
attack but the evidence of the strange rituals which took place 
there remained a bucket of blood animal entrails and a variety 
of seemingly random religious artifacts carefully arranged on the 
desk 
before reporters were allowed in the military removed what 
soldiers said were packets of cocaine wrapped in tropical leaves 
soldiers who confiscated the stockpile described their haul as 
about 50 pounds of cocaine 
at headquarters and in washington the generals said it was 50 
kilograms at 22 pounds per kilo that would better back up the 
us claim that noriega was involved heavily in the drug trade 
it was possible the generals were referring to cocaine also 
recovered elsewhere but reporters never were able to reconcile the 
figures

perhaps the most difficult term to grasp in the war area was the 
word secure as in the area has been secured 
early thursday reporters were told the area around the marriott 
hotel on the east side of panama city was secured but within 
hours an attempt to land a helicopter containing a news group at 
nearby patilla airport was waved off because of a firefight 
the southern command headquarters also was supposed to be secure 
when on thursday afternoon a new battle erupted there 
the area that was one of the first attacked and secured 
wednesday was that of the commandancia noriegas downtown 
headquarters but reporters visiting the area friday were told of 
new sniper fire from the charred and shattered high rises 
soldiers nervously patrolled the streets while local residents 
brazenly looted what was left in the buildings 
one gi showed reporters a motorized twoperson tricycle with a 
machinegun mount in back it was operated by noreiga defenders to 
whiz through the streets and fire upon the attacking americans 
until they came in the crosshairs a us soldiers m60 machine gun 
the gi proudly showed the spot a few yards away where the 
panamanian gunners brains had landed 
on avenue a nearby a young panamanian man waved at the us 
troops trying to get their attention he failed until he came up 
with a grabber he walked out and placed a live rocketpropelled 
grenade round in the middle of the street 
it seemed there was little security in the term secure

about 200 cambodians prayed for peace on 
christmas day in their refugee camp in thailand exactly 11 years 
after vietnam invaded their homeland and sparked the civil war that 
forced them to flee 
i pray to god that i can go back to my country said sau 
rany 22 a religion teacher who wants to be a nun 
inside a church of bamboo and palm leaves she and other 
refugees paid respect at an altar with a traditional cambodian 
greeting hands folded before their faces besides the altar 
drooped a christmas tree with a cellophane star and plastic 
flowers no mass was offered since there are no priests among the 
refugees and the foreign priests were away 
sau ranys father and her brother were killed by the khmer 
rouge and she fled to the unaided guerrilla camp in 1984 
because of food shortages and other hardships she said god allows 
her suffering probably to test my endurance 
vietnamese divisions invaded cambodia on dec 25 1978 ending 
nearly four years of khmer rouge rule and installing another 
communist government the un border camps hold more than 300000 
refugees from the conflict 
the war between the phnom penh government and a threeparty 
guerrilla coalition dominated by the khmer rouge has intensified 
since vietnams troop pullout in late september 
almost all those at the church were women and their children 
usually we have more men here but today they are carrying weapons 
and food at the border sau rany explained 
one soldier bith phonn 42 made it to church after taking 
leave to look after his wife eight months pregnant with their 
ninth child 
bith phonn displayed the scars from bullet wounds in both thighs 
and the back of his head he said he has killed about 10 enemy 
soldiers in six years of fighting 
i know it is a sin but if i dont kill him he will kill 
me he said 
relief officials and diplomats say that prince norodom 
sihanouks group which controls site b has stepped up 
conscription because the united states and other countries are 
supplying aid to the guerrilla armies depending on their size 
the un border relief operation and the international 
commuittee of the red cross have told sihanouk officials they 
oppose what appear to be efforts to conscript minors 
one aid officials speaking on condition of anonymity said a 
large group of students some as young as 14 were taken out of the 
camp in august and earlier this month for military help 
the deputy sihanouk administrator at site b kun kim teng 
claimed sunday that all those involved were 18 or older he said 
the students went for political not military training in august 
and those who left this month were carrying food to civilians in 
newly liberated areas near the thai border 
all were volunteers he said

the communist party leadership met monday but 
failed to agree on how to deal with the lithuanian partys 
unprecedented declaration of independence from the kremlin a 
source said 
the source one of the more than 250 members of the partys 
policymaking central committee said the committee would resume 
its plenary meeting on the question tuesday 
they decided to think it over and start again said the 
highranking party official who spoke on condition he not be 
identified 
lithuanian communists voted wednesday at a special congress in 
their capital of vilnius to form their own party rejecting appeals 
for unity from president mikhail s gorbachev and other top soviet 
officials 
the lithuanians break is serious because it is without 
precedent in the history of the party founded by vladimir i lenin 
who demanded and forged a unitary party across the soviet union 
moreover lithuanian reformers predict local party organizations 
in many of the other 14 constituent soviet republics will rapidly 
follow their example which would present gorbachev with a 
fractured party as he prepares for a nationwide party congress in 
october 1990 
the central committee convened in moscow on monday to consider 
the situation in the lithuanian party branch staterun radio 
moscow said other official media did not immediately report on the 
closeddoor session 
algirdas brazauskas the lithuanian party leader said the 
break which included drafting a separate party program was 
necessary for lithuanian communists to compete successfully in 
local elections feb 24 
however a group of lithuanian communists who opposed the break 
countered by forming their own leadership and pledged continuing 
loyalty to moscow 
the central committee invited both brazauskas and the leaders of 
the antiseparatist faction to moscow to attend its meeting radio 
moscow said

the protestant pastor who sparked 
romanias revolution by inspiring his congregation to defend their 
faith is a quiet clergyman eager to resume his parish duties 
the revolution that toppled president nicolae ceausescu began 
dec 15 in the western city of timisoara when several hundred 
people formed a human chain around the parish church of laszlo 
toekes to prevent his arrest 
that gesture grew into massive protests for freedom that 
resulted in a bloodbath as thousands were gunned down by 
ceausescus forces 
the brutality of that massacre ignited the hatred and anger of 
the countrys 23 million people who had suffered immense hardship 
under ceakusescus repressive leadership 
a chant often heard in the nationwide protests that finally 
toppled ceausescu friday was timisoara timisoara 
toakes was named to the national salvation committee that was 
formed to run the country but the softspoken minister said he 
planned to remain in his western village and build up a 
congregation there 
born in 1952 in the transylvanian city of cluj toekes a 
reformed protestant resisted stifling oppression to campaign for 
religious and ethnic rights 
of ethnic hungarian extraction and the son of a protestant 
minister toekes has been suspended from ministering to his 
parishes and moved to other areas when the state deemed that his 
influence among his congregation had grown too strong 
in april he was again suspended by his church superiors from 
practicing in timisoara where he had been since 1986 
toekes refused to comply with the order his home was repeatedly 
attacked and he received threatening notes 
toekes said in october that reforms in eastern europe had 
created favorable political circumstances for romania and i 
am among those who have had enough of silence and being silenced 
after masked men reportedly broke into his home in november and 
threatened to kill him and his family he moved into the church 
with his pregnant wife and sent their son to stay with grandparents 
on saturday toekes told two hungarian visitors that when the 
unrest started in timisoara he was abducted and beaten by security 
guards 
he said he was interrogated for three days at the parish in the 
transylvanian village of mineu on thursday he was asked to sign a 
document stating he had not been mistreated and the interrogating 
officers asked him for forgiveness the hungarian mti news agency 
reported quoting the hungarians who visited him 
toekes cause has been taken up in hungary where the plight of 
the estimated 17 million ethnic hungarian minority in romania has 
become a chief concern 
relations between the two countries have long been strained over 
the territory of transylvania which had belonged to hungary for 
centuries before it was awarded to romania in a 1920 treaty except 
for a brief period during world war ii it remained with romania 
in 1988 toekes joined 16 people in signing a petition opposing 
a plan to move ethnic hungarians from rural villages to government 
housing complexes hungary and western human rights activists said 
the plan would destroy village culture and ethnic traditions 
since the revolutionaries took over the state tv and radio in 
bucharest friday ethnic hungarians again have been allowed a voice 
i believe that now for the first time in centuries there is a 
historical opportunity for the hungarian and romanian peoples to 
extend a hand to each other in friendship toekes was quoted by 
his hungarian visitors as saying

many families reunited for the 
first time in decades carolers sang on pragues old charles 
bridge and church bells rang across the nation monday on 
czechoslovakias first free christmas in 41 years 
i feel like this is a miracle said ivan martin jirous who 
was in prison last christmas serving time for offering unauthorized 
lectures on art and publishing an unofficial arts magazine 
jirous 45 was released nov 25 about a week after the start 
of the peaceful revolution that ousted the hardline communist 
president put the government in the hands of reformers and set the 
nation on the road to electing a former dissident vaclav havel as 
president before the new year 
imprisonment and exile have torn apart families for years 
jirous who spent more than eight years in jail for his 
subversive activities accompanied his two young daughters and 
his wife to church monday to give thanks for his release which he 
called a present from the mercy of god 
on christmas eve 1978 jirous was in ostrov nad ohri prison 
notorious for its brutal guards as well as for the cruelty between 
prisoners 
but on christmas something happened jirous recalled we 
placed a table in the middle of our cells and everybody broght 
food chrismas sweets fruit everything good that they had 
together we sat at the long table and there were no 
differences no accounting done on how much we brought or took we 
sang songs not real christmas carols because people who are in 
czechoslovak prisons do not know about christmas maternal warmth 
the closeness of families morals or religion but together we 
sang 
jirous said he considered saying a few words about the meaning 
of christmas the birth of christ and christian charity 
but i didnt the way these people at the bottom of society 
were unselfishly and joyously together was the real fulfillment of 
christmas without a theological facade it was my most beautiful 
christmas he said 
on the 15th century charles bridge groups of young carolers 
sang haunting traditional christmas melodies in the days leading 
up to christmas in previous years police chased carolers from the 
broad cobbled kings road 
rejoice the christ is born rejoice the carolers 
exuberantly sang sunday night while joy illuminated the faces of 
many listeners 
everybody is so happy so cheerful it is euphoric with 
everybody chatting about the future said dagmar vogel 22 home 
for christmas for the first time since she was 15 months old 
family conversations are filled with new possiblities the 
chance to study abroad to write freely to work without fear to 
be reunited with relatives overseas she said 
miss vogels parents emigrated from czechoslovakia to 
switzerland after the 1968 soviet invasion crushed the reforms of 
the prague spring 
for 21 years they kept in touch by letter but miss vogel said 
she did not know many of the family members she has met since 
coming home this week 
there are so many aunts cousins i havent met but from the 
first moment ive felt like i belong its great to have a family 
its wonderful to know somebody is there she said standing 
beside the giant fir tree on old town square with a sign reading 
freedom under the christmas tree 
on christmas eve miss vogel her family and millions of other 
czechoslovaks watched christmas mass on an unprecedented live tv 
broadcast the mass from pragues 13th century strahov monastery 
was said by vaclav maly a former dissident priest who was banned 
for 11 years for his human rights activities 
millions of other believers jammed into churches and cathedrals 
throughout the nation for midnight mass on christmas day 
90yearold cardinal frantisek tomasek said mass at the gothic st 
vitus cathedral overlooking the city delivering a sermon on the 
responsiblity that freedom brings 
in central prague on the site where prodemocracy rallies 
turned the tide of czechoslovak history last month crowds of 
students gathered to sing and share the holiday at the statue of

organizers struggled for three years to 
stage a winterfest of snow sculpting and ice skating in spite of 
balmy temperatures that sometimes seemed more suited to new orleans 
than new york 
so this year they gave up and canceled the festival 
then the snow began 
buffalonians awoke monday to their first white christmas since 
1985 in a december that figures to be one of the two coldest on 
record nearly 3 feet of snow has fallen here so far this season 
and the national weather service says theres reason to believe it 
will stay around for quite some time 
three feet so early in the season isnt unusual buffalo is on 
the downwind side of lake erie and gets lake effect snow 
increased by moist air over the lake but its a far cry from the 
kind of weather the city has seen in the last couple of few years 
but despite the return of wintry weather the greater buffalo 
chamber of commerce is adamant there will be no winterfest this 
year 
the chamber which provided the services of 10 staff members and 
raised 150000 from businesses to put on the threeweek festival 
wont quite say that the lack of snow was the reason it decided in 
september to cancel the 1990 edition 
but spokeswoman karen wodarczak said last week that the chamber 
did not really believe it was getting its moneys worth from the 
festival 
city residents have not put up a great outcry to have winterfest 
revived but the situation has prompted a few jokes 
someone just called me and said cant you bring it back 
then we wont have any snow said dottie gallagher spokeswoman 
for buffalo place an organization that oversees the downtown 
shopping district and helped sponsor the previous festivals 
a lot of people here felt it was kind of ironic said deputy 
mayor samuel iraci all that stuff went into publicizing the fact 
that here we are in buffalo and it gets cold here yeah and we get 
snow but so what and then theres no snow 
last years winterfest was held in late january a month in 
which only 5 inches of snow fell and temperatures reached 59 
degrees 
youd walk around saying is it really winter here said 
national weather service meteorologist george skari 
the year before when only 564 inches fell during the entire 
winter a little more than half the normal amount snow for the 
snowsculpting contest had to be trucked in from canada and the 
hills south of buffalo 
this year however is the coldest december on record since 
1876 although the longrange forecast is for near normal 
temperatures the rest of the winter skari said there is reason to 
be skeptical about that 
when you have a cold november and december especially 
december like weve had theres a higher percentage of the next 
month being cold he said theres no scientific fact to that 
its just playing with statistics but some of the harshest 
winters have followed a cold december 
as for snowfall skari said watch this year be just about 
banner well have all kinds of snow and there wont be a 
winterfest 
a few parts of the show will still go on including the 
snowsculpting contest sponsored by buffalo place in early february 
iraci said buffalos first first night celebration an arts and 
music festival on new years eve also will help pick up the slack 
he said the city will help revive winterfest if other private 
groups want to assume the chambers role 
wodarczak found a silver lining in the troubles of winterfest 
one of our goals of winterfest was to improve buffalos 
national image wodarczak said we did get some national 
publicity over the fact that there was no snow so we considered it 
a positive

leonard bernstein transformed a christmas 
performance of beethovens ninth symphony into an appeal for 
brotherhood as west and east berliners mingled freely in the 
divided city for the first christmas in 28 years 
i am experiencing a historical moment incomparable with 
others in my long long life the american conductor said during 
the nationally televised performance monday 
bernstein conducted an international group of musicians in the 
schauspielhaus capping three days of performances that celebrated 
the demise of the berlin wall and the struggle for freedom 
throughout eastern europe 
the ninth symphony was inspired by german writer friedrich 
schillers 18th century poem ode to joy in the concert 
bernstein substituted the word freedom for joy in the 
chorus to reflect his personal message 
the 71yearold musician conducted the same symphony at the 
philharmonic in west berlin in a performance timed to end at 
midnight saturday when west germans were allowed to travel without 
visas into east germany for the first time 
more than 1000 people poured into the schauspielhaus for the 
1030 am christmas concert while hundreds more packed the square 
in front of the concert hall to watch the performance on a giant 
television monitor 
the concert was also broadcast live in more than 20 countries by 
satellite 
bernstein united an international group of musicians from east 
and west germany as well as the united states britain france and 
the soviet union the four victorious world war ii allies still 
technically responsible for governing berlin 
the east german government presented bernstein the star of 
peoples friendship 
in the city hundreds of thousands of berliners passed freely 
through the wall via crossings created in the concrete barrier 
after east germany threw open its borders six weeks ago 
west berliners had to wait up to three hours to cross into east 
berlin by car and there were long lines at two new crossings at the 
brandenburg gate 
one west berliner riding a bicycle and dressed up as santa claus 
failed to persuade border guards to let him through ahead of the 
rest of the crowd 
berliners packed cafes and restaurants on unter den linden east 
berlins most elegant boulevard while in west berlin street 
vendors did a brisk business selling sausages on a cold sunny day 
east german border police reported that 274500 east germans had 
crossed into west germany while 268000 west germans went into 
east germany 
it was busier in berlin however where 220000 east berliners 
went west and 257000 west berliners went east

an anonymous benefactor is enriching the 
lives of veteran whitworth college faculty members providing free 
vacations anywhere in the world exotic food and other gifts 
this person has been a santa claus many times over said ed 
olson a geology professor who has been given two weeks in new 
zealand with the use of a motor home next month 
for the past year and a half 17 faculty members who have been 
at the small private liberal arts college at least 20 years have 
benefited from the largesse of a man they know only as mm for 
mystery man 
professors typically are contacted by laurel livingston of the 
bremerton aaa travel agency who offers them and their spouses 
twoweek vacations including travel lodging and sometimes 1000 
to cover miscellaneous expenses 
after the trips they get presents like thanksgiving hams 
imported coffee exotic foods from distant cities cameras 
binoculars calendars and art many accompanied by notes signed 
only mm 
one professor got a coffee grinder and a few months later a 
second coffee grinder with a note explaining the first model was 
unreliable 
the travel agent wont say who the donor is but faculty members 
believe he graduated from whitworth sometime in the 1960s went 
into business in the puget sound area and lives in seattle 
we honestly cant identify who it is said howard gage a 
math professor who took a gift trip to england with his wife last 
summer thats part of the fun 
this is too good to be real said art professor spike 
grosvenor who got a trip to england last summer its the sort 
of thing that only happens on christmas tv specials or in the 
readers digest 
recipients since the program began in june 1988 are 14 men and 
three women 50 to 87 years old six are retired two other retired 
faculty members were were unable to accept trips for health reasons 
ive never heard of any other faculty group getting this sort 
of reward said psychology professor patricia macdonald who has 
taught at whitworth for 35 years and received a trip to hawaii last 
summer it makes us feel special 
chemistry professor bob bocksch the first recipient of a gift 
vacation initially refused a second trip 
i think he felt our first trip didnt cost enough being just 
two weeks in hawaii so he suggested we take a second one he 
said 
bocksch wrote a note through the travel agent suggesting a 
donation to a chemistry equipment fund instead 
the donor sent a 5000 check to the school then insisted that 
bocksch take a second vacation he relented and took a 10day 
alaskan cruise 
the first three trips were given to faculty members who were 
told that the gifts were in gratitude to teachers who helped the 
mystery man when he was a student 
later gifts went to people he wanted to honor for their 
contributions to whitworth livingston said 
livingston described the donor as a very generous very caring 
person who travels frequently and likes people she said he would 
not give his reasons for the gifts or say how much he had spent 
grosvenor is one of three recipients who have talked with him by 
phone 
certain clues make me think he was a classmate of howard 
gages and mine grosvenor said he knew that i spent one 
summer working as a groundskeeper at the college 
whoever he is he does his homework he knew all about my 
field of study and that i had never been to europe its amazing 
how much he knew 
grosvenor said the donor suggested a trip this fall to england 
to study stained glass the professors special interest he said 
the resulting trip was the most wonderful perfect vacation i 
could have had 
music professor thomas tavener was just offered a trip but has 
yet to choose a destination it is exciting he said i guess 
there are benefits for staying in one place for 31 years

debts of east european and third world 
countries are due to rise next year despite the plan of treasury 
secretary nicholas f brady to ease some of the heaviest burdens on 
debtor countries 
when you have a vibrant growing economy like indonesia 
for example debt can be a good thing if it doesnt grow too 
fast said john m underwood of the world bank 
its a sign that foreigners have confidence that its a good 
place to put their money 
indonesias debt rose from 43 billion in 1986 to 52 billion 
last year according to figures the bank issued this week 
indonesia had to pay out nearly 85 billion in principal and 
interest to its creditors in 1988 
third world leaders complain that such outflows leave them litle 
to build the schools and buy the equipment to create jobs for their 
growing populations the bank calculated the total outflow at more 
than 51 billion this year 
until 1983 new loans to developing countries brought them more 
money than they had to pay out on the old ones 
despite the cost third world governments still seek more loans 
if only to help pay the interest on the old loans 
underwood is top economist in the international economics 
department of the world bank the largest source of aid to third 
world countries the aid is also in the form of loans over 21 
billion in the year that ended june 30 
the bank plans to provide as much as 135 billion to poland 
which got nothing last year but already owes more than 42 billion 
its new noncommunist leadership is hoping to borrow an additional 
4 billion or more in the coming year 
bradys strategy seeks to ease the burden for 39 debtor 
countries by combining debt and interest reduction with new loans 
from banks so far plans have been developed for three countries 
mexico the philippines and costa rica 
the world bank estimated that his strategy could save as much as 
6 billion a year for 19 severely indebted middleincome 
countries like argentina and the philippines which owe much of 
their debt to private banks he made his proposal last march 
before the big changes in eastern european countries which now have 
better prospects for getting the new loans they want 
for the poorest countries governments are the main creditors 
rather than banks during the 1980s 10 creditor governments have 
forgiven 23 billion owed to them the united states which was 
not among the 10 has promised to forgive another billion new aid 
to these countries most of them in africa is now largely in the 
form of grants 
two officials of resources for the future a private study group 
in washington said that the united states has an interest in 
easing the debt burden the heaviest debtors are among the biggest 
buyers of us goods the less they have to pay out to banks the 
more they have left over to buy the products of us farms and 
industries they pointed out 
the net result of easing debt burdens would be more robust 
economies that would support more stable political systems and 
create stronger markets for us exports wrote elaine m koerner 
and george e rossmiller in the fall issue of resource for the 
future the organizations quarterly publication 
the world bank predicted that the debt of 111 countries will 
rise to 1189 trillion in 1990 from 1165 trillion this year 
underwood said that the institute of international finance which 
collects figures for major private banks adds another 188 billion 
for 10 countries including the soviet union that the bank does 
not count the central intelligence agency estimated that the 
soviets owed 423 billion to western banks last year 
that would bring the current total to 1353 trillion the 
figure could be raised in 1990 by new lending to help east european 
governments as they switch to something more like the market 
economies of the west

balcony overlooking sundappled st peters square where tens of 
thousands of faithful and tourists listened to the annual urbi et 
orbi latin for to the city and to the world

english his head bowed 
the world longs for peace john paul declared then listed 
conflicts worldwide lebanon the holy land central america 
africa and asia 
after his words about eastern europe and especially romania the 
pope paused for a few seconds and lifted his head 
may this old europe of ours also receive you o word 
incarnate he said deep within her she carries the imprint of 
your gospel from which she has derived her culture her art her 
concept of the inviolable dignity of man 
may this europe open her doors and her heart to understand and 
receive the anxieties the fears and the problems of the nations 
which seek her help the pope said 
may she respond with the strength and the generosity of her 
christian roots to this very special moment of history which 
the world is now experiencing as if awakened from a nightmare and 
opened up to a better hope

was referring to czechoslovakia east germany bulgaria hungary 
and his native poland where communist regimes this year have seen

manuel antonio noriega has sought refuge at the vatican embassy to 
evade us troops sent in to capture him more than 200 people have 
died as a result of the fighting

when texan john baize a vice president for 
the american soybean association criticized the united states 
controversial sugar program in an interview with a graduate 
student he thought he was speaking off the record 
but after copies of an alleged transcript were leaked on capitol 
hill baize found himself out of a job and at the center of an 
international intrigue that has touched minnesotas agriculture 
commissioner and apparently angered agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter 
at a yearend news conference thursday yeutter appealed for 
broad support of liberalized trade policies being advocated in 
geneva in ongoing negotiations under the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade 
yeutter said he believes there is broad support for the bush 
administrations proposals but noted that we have seen some 
evidence of undercutting here and there by particular groups 
which he did not identify 
kelly shipp his press secretary later told the associated 
press that yeutter referred mostly to minnesota agriculture 
commissioner jim nichols a democrat and not specifically to any 
farm organizations 
pressed about nichols she said only that nichols was the one 
thats on his mind 
in an interview friday nichols said the baize incident and 
yeutters complaints are linked and he is not yeutters only 
opponent on gatt issues 
nichols farm policy analyst mark ritchie is responsible for 
circulating copies of baizes interview with the european student 
to minnesota sugar beet growers who have a stake in protecting 
the governments strict quotas on sugar imports those comments 
ended up on capitol hill and sparked the furor that led to baizes 
resignation on nov 10 from the job he had held since 1979 
as baizes comments were circulated anonymously on capitol hill 
ritchie also was circulating gatt documents in congress from the 
us trade representative which nichols contended pitted soybean 
farmers against sugar producers 
baize believes the student who taped the august interview 
which he thought was to be an academic discussion to help her write 
a thesis on agricultural trade turned the tape over to an 
organization in france 
baize said the french group apparently gave the interview to 
ritchie who acknowledges providing summaries to minnesota sugar 
beet growers 
those growers contacted others in the sugar industry and the 
transcript was suddenly being faxed all over the hill baize 
said 
marlyn jorgensen president of the american soybean association 
moved to assure rep kika de la garza dtexas chairman of the 
house agriculture committee that the asa does not oppose the us 
sugar program 
in a letter dated oct 25 jorgensen told de la garza whose 
district includes texas sugar cane growers that baizes comments 
had been taken out of context and it appears that asa has been 
used for purposes that many of us do not know 
i cant believe john lost his job over this deal nichols 
said johns said it for years 
said baize i had a frank academic discussion and i 
understood and was told it was to be off the record i resent 
anyone using an offtherecord interview taking things out of 
context with a malicious intent to injure me but so be it 
baize a gatesville texas native said his sources say the 
student was told before she left europe to specifically interview 
him and that when she returned the group asked for only one 
interview tape out of 25 or 30 his 
baize said he may have been singled out because he was the 
architect of the soybean associations charge that the european 
communitys oilseed subsidies were illegal under international 
trading rules 
a dispute settlement panel of gatt ruled the us position was 
100 percent correct baize said 
the fact that we filed the case and were very aggressive in 
persuing it here and in europe angered a lot of people in the 
oilseed industry in france and europe baize said 
ritchie the farm policy analyst claims baize knew the 
interview was on the record and that the students report would be 
published in europe 
ritchie who is on a technical review committee for the 
students thesis said baizes comments put his states 370 
million sugar beet industry at risk by giving europe more 
ammunition to fight the us sugar program in gatt 
baize meanwhile said he has other irons in the fire and 
is not bitter at his former employer 
i guess ive always been a sucker for these students who come 
in and want to learn something baize said

charles hunter surprised his teacher and 
classmates with the results of a oneinamillion task but he had 
a little hightech help from a computer 
steve randak who teaches a biology class for gifted students at 
lafayette jefferson high school told his students he would give an 
a for the semester to anyone who wrote out every number from one to 
1 million 
hunter took up the challenge last week he toted in all 1 
million numbers printed on about 2400 pages of paper that weighed 
about 50 pounds 
he didnt qualify for the a because he generated the numbers on 
his home computer but his regular work is earning him an a in the 
course anyway 
hes the first one who ever took off and did something 
creative with this and this is typical of charles said randak 
hunter said he first set out to write each number by hand but 
he lost interest at about 5000 
his interest was renewed when he thought of printing the numbers 
by computer he ran the program at least seven hours a day for two 
weeks after 2 boxes of computer paper and three ink cartridges 
he reached the magic number 
i just thought it would be really neat to show someone could 
do it and to prove how large a million is said hunter 
doing the task longhand even at the brisk pace of one number a 
second would take more than 11 days straight working night and 
day

in a musty basement storage room of the 
muskegon county museum surrounded by mannequin parts and antique 
canoes in disrepair wilfrid berg is picking up where he left off 
55 years ago 
the 81yearold artist is finally getting the chance to paint 
the second of two murals commissioned from him in 1934 by the works 
progress administration for the childrens reading room at the city 
library 
i had the sketches done i was all ready to do it back then 
and then the money ran out said berg a slight man with white 
hair and sparkling blue eyes 
the wpa a new deal program of president franklin d roosevelt 
to help economic recovery from the depression notified the lake 
michigan city it was eligible for mural funds at the time artists 
were being put to work on murals in public buildings nationwide 
berg then 26 was contacted and the next morning i was 
looking for a spot he recalled 
the childrens reading room of the hackley public library was 
chosen 
the wpa commissioned two murals for opposite walls of the room 
above oak bookcases berg finished one now mounted on the west 
wall called the world at your door it features people of 
different nations in native dress 
he recalls being paid either 100 or 200 for that project 
before funds ran out he worked five more weeks on his own time to 
complete it 
the second mural featuring characters from classic childrens 
literature was canceled 
i put the sketches away and forgot about it but really its 
something i always wanted to do berg says as he glances at his 
sketches of intermingling characters such as pinocchio robinson 
crusoe peter rabbit cinderella and huck finn 
library officials had been trying to find the sketches for the 
29foot mural for two or three years before they surfaced at the 
adjacent muskegon museum of art a couple of years ago said dale 
pretzer the librarys director 
it was like looking for a lost manuscript thats a sequel to a 
great book pretzer said 
once the sketches were found there still was the challenge of 
finding funds for berg to take up his task again 
along came muskegon residents shirley and daniel rapoport 
longtime supporters of the library which is celebrating its 
centennial in 1990 
my children loved that library so much as they were growing 
up said mrs rapoport a retired schoolteacher when we found 
out about the other mural and that the artist was still alive i 
thought it would be such a lovely gift for the centennial 
celebration 
she wont say how much she is contributing for the work calling 
it a modest amount 
meanwhile berg dressed in blue jeans and a denim shirt is 
working in his makeshift studio seven hours a day and is expecting 
to finish the project in about four months 
i dont move quite as fast as i used to he said with a 
smile 
he is keeping the murals original design and theme idle 
hours with good books is time well spent the dedication of the 
mural is scheduled for july 
the project has not overwhelmed berg hes never retired the 
nevermarried muskegon native i could never afford a wife he 
says recently completed a mural for the county museum chronicling 
the history of the city and paints lake michigan landscapes 
he recalls taking odd jobs truck driving house painting 
framing to support his love of creating art although hes been 
painting most of his life recognition has come only in the last 
few years 
in 1988 the art museum featured his varied work including 
watercolors oils lithographs even cartoons in a oneman show 
wilfrid berg a muskegon treasure 
muskegons not exactly a hotbed of art so were very lucky 
to have him said volunteer curator robert youngman who found 
the sketches i have a great respect for his talent and im 
thrilled hes finally getting the recognition he deserves

nicolae ceausescu a peasants son who 
rose to rule romania with an iron grip for 24 years created a cult 
of personality unmatched in eastern europe since the days of soviet 
dictator josef stalin 
his wife elena became his virtual secondincommand until 
their sudden descent from power 
the two were reported captured saturday trying to flee a popular 
revolution sparked by a massacre of thousands of people on monday 
bucharest radio said they were executed after a secret trial found 
them guilty of grave crimes among them the deaths of 60000 
protesters this month and spiriting 1 billion in public funds out 
of the country 
before he was shouted down at a bucharest rally he orchestrated 
thursday his last public appearance the 71yearold communist 
leaders hold on power was so firm that he could carry out a 
foreign policy independent of the soviet union and the other east 
bloc countries 
just one month ago he was overwhelmingly reaffirmed as supreme 
leader by a fiercely obedient communist party conference he was 
the last hardline communist leader in the soviet bloc after 
democratic reforms swept through poland hungary east germany 
czechoslovakia and bulgaria this year 
his party hailed himself as the genius of the carpathians 
and the conducator his severity earned him the nickname 
draculescu for bram stokers bloodthirsty count of 
transylvania 
he imposed austerity on the people yet was building a 
presidential palace as a monument to himself he had lavish 
mountain and sea retreats 
born jan 26 1918 in scornicesti ceausescu was the third son 
of a large peasant family an elementary school dropout he was 
apprenticed as a shoemaker took a job in a factory and joined the 
illegal communist party youth organization at age 15 he became a 
party member three years later in 1936 
before and during world war ii his communist activities landed 
him in jail several times he became a protege of communist leader 
gheorghe gheorghiudej rose quickly in the party and succeeded 
his mentor after his death in 1965 
he turned the party into a personal instrument gradually 
pushing aside all leaders who opposed his policies and installing 
loyalists on the ruling 23member politburo including elena 
ceausescu who rose to head the countrys scientific community 
despite doubts about her background and education 
nicu their youngest son was regional party chief in central 
romania valentin an adopted son zoiaelena their daughter and 
ceausescu brothers held prestigious posts as did several inlaws 
western analysts and knowledgeable romanians estimate that about 
40 members of his family held top jobs in the party and state 
hierarchy 
when he was elected president in march 1974 an official picture 
showed him holding a silver scepter as the symbol of authority 
the personality cult he encouraged took on the trappings of 
worship and pervaded practically all aspects of public life his 
portrait lined the streets in bucharest and other romanian cities 
and bookstores were full of works attributed to him 
the united states and other western powers originally cultivated 
ceausescus relatively independent foreign policy stand within the 
sovietled warsaw pact two us presidents visited bucharest 
richard nixon in 1969 and gerald ford in 1975 and president jimmy 
carter threw a state dinner for him in washington in 1978 queen 
elizabeth ii awared him an honorary knighthood 
ceausescu maintained diplomatic relations with israel even after 
other soviet bloc countries broke them during the 1967 middle east 
war 
in keeping with his maverick image he denounced the sovietled 
invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 refused to participate and 
refused to allow any foreign troops in romania 
romania was the only east bloc country to send athletes to the 
1984 olympics in los angeles breaking the sovietled boycott 
in later years he grew more dogmatic rejecting the need for 
reform adopted by other bloc allies such as poland and hungary 
earlier this year he urged his warsaw pact allies to invade poland 
to prevent a solidarityled government from taking power 
romania became increasingly isolated in both east and west 
particularly after 30000 romanians mostly ethnic hungarians fled 
to hungary last year 
the hungarians complained about alleged discrimination and 
denial of their ethnic and cultural rights but they also sought 
refuge in hungary to escape chronic hardships under ceausescu 
ceausescu viewed the changes in eastern europe with alarm and 
accused other warsaw pact countries of abandoning orthodox 
communism 
the triumph of the revolution requires unity severe 
discipline and a spirit of sacrifice a firm organization is needed 
as well as a tested political leader who knows how to unite and 
lead the masses he told a mass meeting in bucharest earlier this 
year 
he invested billions of dollars in a crash industrialization 
program and rigidly followed a policy of domestic austerity to pay 
off romanias 11 billion foreign debt 
romania once known as the breadbasket of the balkans became 
one of europes poorest countries the longer the food lines and 
the more vocal the peoples complaints the more harshly the regime 
cracked down on critics 
despair spread among the nations 23 million people as hardships 
became more severe throughout the 1980s and in the end not even 
the secret policy or the army could keep them down 
on dec 17 his security forces opened fire on thousands of 
demonstrators in timisoara who demanded freedom and a better life 
beginning the chain of events that brought him down 
he looked surprised and dismayed as his orchestrated rally 
thursday turned into an anticeausescu rally protesters on friday 
burned his portraits and hurled his books into the street

she sits at the negotiating table with mikhail 
gorbachev advises james a baker iii travels on air force one 
with george bush and spars daily with the nations foreign policy 
pundits 
but margaret debardeleben tutwiler a birmingham ala 
debutante with a thick southern drawl says its laughable 
ludicrous embarrassing to suggest shes one of the most powerful 
women in washington 
others disagree 
the 39yearold tutwiler a longtime aide to secretary of state 
baker wears the twin hats of assistant secretary of state for 
public affairs and the state departments spokeswoman one of the 
most visible jobs in government 
as spokeswoman shes the first woman to be assistant secretary 
of state for public affairs the workaholic unmarried tutwiler 
appears almost every day on the klieglighted podium to explain 
us foreign policy to reporters and television audiences around 
the world 
its a long way from finch college tricia nixons alma mater 
and the new york school tutwiler attended before she transferred to 
the university of alabama 
while tutwilers face has become familiar in the last year most 
washington insiders say her influence stems more from her access to 
baker than her sessions at the podium or her knowledge of 
diplomatic nuance 
her greatest strength has always been her close relationship 
with jim baker and her knowledge of what he is doing and 
thinking said john mcwethy abcs state department correspondent 
theodore wilkinson president of the american foreign service 
association agreed 
a career foreign service officer undoubtedly would have a 
stronger grasp of policy but probably wouldnt have tutwilers 
great asset her access to baker he said 
so if access is power and in washington it is tutwiler has 
it 
amidst the oriental rugs and antiques on the departments 
exclusive seventh floor suite tutwilers wellappointed cubbyhole 
has a door leading to bakers office 
and friends and colleagues say shes not bashful about opening 
it to tell her boss of nearly a decade what she thinks on subjects 
ranging from sanctions against china to briefing times during the 
stormtossed ussoviet summit on malta 
behind the southern belle is a steel magnolia say those who 
have seen tutwiler cross wires with the likes of gennady gerasimov 
gorbachevs spokesman 
she has good judgment and instincts about the publics 
reaction says v kim hoggard tutwilers deputy she judges by 
her own reaction thats why baker values her advice 
levelheaded is the way her childhood friend virginia 
scruggs describes tutwiler 
tutwiler although reluctant to engage in selfpromotion says 
her assets are her loyalty and her forthright manner 
i know he thinks im loyal she said of baker and in 
sessions with the secretary and others in his inner circle she 
said she speaks her mind im not playing a game with him in 
other words many times i say what i believe 
tutwilers relationship with baker was forged in the 1980s when 
she was his assistant at the white house at the treasury 
department and on the 1988 bush presidential campaign 
she came to the white house after working in bushs unsuccessful 
1980 presidential primary campaign ronald reagan captured the gop 
nomination but named bush as his running mate she counts both 
baker and bush as her friends 
although tutwiler served as an assistant secretary at the 
treasury department she preferred to remain behind the scenes 
rarely briefing reporters or talking in public 
that changed at the state department 
it was very terrifying and frightening to me to grapple with 
can i do this job that the president and secretary of state would 
like for me to try to do she said 
besides appearing on television tutwiler had to grapple with 
the subject matter 
ill be honest with you it was absolutely overwhelming she 
said to learn all at once the united states foreign policy in 
cambodia in afghanistan in nicaragua in el salvador in arms 
control to learn all our policies about germany to learn 
the world at once 
in the daily press briefings the stylish tutwiler with her 
fashionable clothes and streaked blonde hair usually reads 
verbatim statements prepared by diplomats on issues of the day at 
times she seems stilted fearful of making a mistake 
mcwethy and others say shes getting better without question 
her performance at the briefings has improved and she has a better 
grasp of the subject matter he said 
tutwilers glamorous career hasnt come without some sacrifice 
mainly her personal life 
i really havent had one tutwiler said i always keep 
putting my other interests on the back burner and im definitely 
doing that here 
an organized perfectionist tutwiler keeps a grueling schedule 
she rises at 530 am is at her desk at 630 am and rarely 
returns to her home in fashionable northwest washington before 9 
pm breakfast and dinner often consist of cheese and crackers at 
her desk 
then there is the seemingly nonstop travel over 126000 miles 
since february to places as far away as australia 
in december she traveled to malta for the summit and then 
accompanied baker to london berlin and brussels later that month 
she went to st martin with baker at christmas shes going skiing 
with her brother and sister and their families 
but tutwilers philosophy is that life is a tradeoff a 
compromise and she doesnt know many people who would walk away 
from the chance to sit at the table with gorbachev or see the 
kremlins inner sanctum 
money cant buy that she said 
tutwiler said there will always be time for her other interests 
of which she has many 
i grow roses i love entertaining i love reading i love 
biographies of women i love histories of the south i enjoy 
cooking i enjoy flower arranging i enjoy the study of carpets i 
enjoy personal travel 
despite her consuming job scruggs who has known tutwiler since 
the first grade in birmingham said tutwiler is a familyoriented 
person and a doting aunt who loves spending time with her 
nieces and nephews 
when scruggs the mother of two children gets together with 
tutwiler the two talk about how they envy parts of the others 
life 
but tutwiler seems happy with the choices shes made 
im a very lucky lucky girl she says

the us coast guard says it will test 
a new system for keeping track of oil tankers in alaskas prince 
william sound site of the nations worst oil spill 
the system will utilize satellite signals and longrange aids to 
navigation rather than radar said mike sollosi chief of vessel 
traffic services in the coast guards washington dc 
headquarters 
it is a black box on a ship which takes an accurate position 
of the vessel and transmits the information to a vessel tracking 
system such as the vessel traffic center in valdez sollosi said 
in a statement issued last week 
he said a satellite is a tool for tracking because it is not 
affected by mountains which is a problem in alaska 
tanker traffic in prince william sound has been monitored by 
radar but when the exxon valdez ran aground march 24 the coast 
guard said the vessel was beyond the area normally scanned by the 
valdez radar the ruptured tanker spilled 11 million gallons of 
crude oil into the sound 
after the skipper reported the tanker was aground the coast 
guard was able to find it on radar but operators said reliability 
of the radar was limited by weather 
sollosi said the new system will be evaluated for one year in 
the sound and 22 other ports and waterways around the country he 
said vessel owners will be responsible for the cost of installing 
the black boxes

one year younger than her husband nicolae ceausescu mrs 
ceausescu actually was 72 a year older than the deposed dictator 
bucharest radio said she and her husband were put on trial 
secretly and executed monday for genocide and other crimes against 
the romanian people 
mrs ceaucescu was born in petresti a village in southern 
romania in 1917 she married her husband when both were teenage 
revolutionaries and joined the communist party in 1937 in bucharest 
where she worked in a textile factory 
after ceausescus takeover in 1965 she rapidly rose in the 
party hierarchy she was named a member of the party executive 
committee in 1973 and also was a member of the politburo and first 
vice premier 
she once was elected queen of a workers parade on may 1 
1939 and she lived like one in the last two decades 
elena and nicolae ceausescu acted much like a royal family 
traveling abroad conducting wellstaged visits to farms and 
factories and making a regal promenade at state receptions 
romanian tv on sunday showed footage from one of the ceausescus 
residences displaying some of her jewelry and western currency 
allegedly prepared in a bag for escape 
one of her many expensive fur coats was found at the communist 
party headquarters friday and paraded in front of photographers 
after she and her husband fled the capital by helicopter 
mrs ceausescu was said to be a trained chemist and was praised 
as a scientist of world fame her works filled romanian 
bookstores and were translated into foreign languages but they 
were believed to be ghostwritten by other scientists 
as chairman of the national council for science and education 
mrs ceausescu was in charge of all curricula from elementary 
schools to higher education 
her celebrated competence in science was less than genuine 
during her time as director of the central institute of chemical 
research she took the floor at several national conferences and 
meetings but spoke on general matters 
whenever a specific scientific theme arose she deferred to a 
comrade engineer who then had to explain the details 
gen ion pacepa chief of romanian intelligence operations 
abroad until 1978 when he defected to the united states said in a 
book published last year that his duties included collecting 
classified technological information to be used in the books by 
mrs ceausescu 
pacepa said he was also ordered to ensure mrs ceausescu could 
shop for jewelry whenever she wanted 
he said he reported to her once a week with tapes secretly 
recorded at the residences of their children two sons and a 
daughter and other high officials so she could keep tabs on them 
sources close to her entourage said she was cynical and paid no 
attention to the real needs of the 23 million romanians whom she 
despised 
the worms never get satisfied regardless of how much food you 
give them she was once overheard saying referring to their 
complaints about food shortages that plague romania

romanias revolution against communism 
unlike others in eastern europe has exploded in volatile emotions 
and violence against the repression enforced by the 24year 
dictatorship of nicolae ceausescu 
ceausescu and his wife elena were reported to be executed on 
monday after a secret trial on charges of particularly grave crimes 
against the people 
no other east european country revolting in the name of 
democracy has reacted in this way but no other east european 
country had a ceausescu whose unparalleled personality cult 
trumpeted his golden era while imposing more and more hardship 
as mandated debt repayment and industrialization programs 
brought hardship to every romanian dissent was largely repressed 
by his dreaded securitate a massive network of at least 700000 
people 
workers who dared to protest disappeared mysteriously 
intellectuals with a higher profile in society faced prison 
mental hospital internal exile or house arrest 
laws mandated the reporting of every unauthorized conversation 
with a foreigner the registration of every typewriter potential 
weapons in the war of words against ceausescus rule and 
censorship far more draconian than any other in the soviet bloc 
everywhere in eastern europe the existence of the censor lent 
weight even to words written with little intention of riling 
against the communist rule despised across half a continent 
in romania this was taken to the extreme dissident poet ana 
blandiana a member of the national salvation committee that is now 
trying to run the balkan country had a book banned last year 
simply for a poem about a scallion 
for this scallion she wrote poems have been written and 
portraits painted the regime assumed she was referring to 
ceausescu 
such actions revealed the nearparanoia of the ceausescu regime 
a government headed by peasants turned revolutionaries then 
dictators whose total control knew none of the limits imposed on 
aristocrats or monarchs by generations of breeding and sense of the 
possible 
thus the ceausescus and their children reportedly drank 
gambled and lived the high life at will ion pacepa former chief 
of counterintelligence who defected to the united states in 1978 
wrote in memoirs published last year that elena ceausescu listened 
every week to tapes made at her childrens apartments and the homes 
of high officials 
the ceausescus regarded every aspect of public life as their 
private property in 1966 ceausescu decreed that every romanian 
family should have four children a norm increased two years ago 
to five kids per family 
few complied but women were regularly subjected to 
gynecological examinations at work to ensure that they were not 
hiding any pregnancy they might try to abort for fear they could 
not feed their own children 
blandiana once talked of the romanians as an entire people 
still unborn yet condemned to be born through womens bodies 
never asked if they consented 
citizens everywhere feared tight surveillance on a flight out 
of romania in 1987 a romanian exile living in sweden talked 
nonstop of the privations he had found on his first visit home in 
five years apologizing for burbling because he had been unable to 
speak the truth for 10 days 
the barefaced lies of officials in romania angered even 
westerners who visited just for a few days for citizens it was 
much worse 
a romanian now living abroad recalls for instance that one of 
her closest friends once confided in a whisper in a private house 
that her husband a state official would take her into the 
bathroom and run water speaking in a soft voice if he wanted to 
tell her about anything however harmless at the office 
such repression was bound to explode in a cascade of words once 
ceausescu went this is happening now all over romania where 
makeshift committees in each town repeatedly denounce the regime 
but the unparalleled repression akin only to josef stalins 
soviet union and not to any other east european country in 1989 
also bred the violence now seen on the streets of bucharest 
the revolt against ceausescu was bred of that violence and of 
despair the thousands of antigovernment protesters who took to 
the streets of timisoara on dec 17 mown down by the gunfire of 
security forces braved death because despair had overcome fear in 
their quest for bread and freedom 
knowing of the massacre and the other revolutions that had left 
their land the last bastion of stalinism in the warsaw pact 
romanians in several other cities also revolted 
more carnage by the security forces convinced the army to come 
over to their side early friday then desperation switched sides 
knowing that popular hatred of the dictator they once served 
will suffice to kill them or put them behind bars ceausescus 
security forces began to draw arms caches and safe houses to shoot 
destroy and kill in a murderous last show of their power 
it is as if the clock had turned back 44 years to the dying days 
of world war ii in europe when soviet troops had to fight street 
for street to gain control of berlin from diehard nazis who knew 
they had only death to face if they surrendered 
the national salvation committee is issuing repeated appeals to 
the population not to take retribution for the years of privation 
they suffered at the hands of ceausescu and the securitate 
but a discussion of the most suitable punishment for the 
captured dictator on bucharest radio sunday before the execution 
reflected the bitter hatred of a population that felt even a death 
sentence would not pay them back for what they have endured 
ceausescu was a bastard said maria stoica a worker in 
bucharest he shouldnt die quickly he must pay for all the 
crimes with which he poisoned us 
he killed us for 24 years said dumitru grunea a car 
worker let him be tried before the people and executed the way 
18th century prince constantin brincoveanu was killed 
brincoveanu was beheaded by the turks in constantinople after 
being forced to witness the executions of his own sons 
alluding to the meager supplies for which romanians had to queue 
six hours a day an unidentified woman added ceausescu should 
eat the meatless bones we were given as food

archbishop desmond tutu of south africa on 
monday compared his countrys suppression of blacks to israels 
treatment of palestinians in the occupied lands where christmas 
celebrations were subdued because of the arab uprising 
the nobel peace prize laureate came under increased criticism 
from jews and also christians sympathetic to israel who accused 
him of taking a onesided approach to the middle east conflict 
during his fiveday trip 
members of our team have remarked on the similarities between 
the situation in the occupied territories and that in south 
africa tutu told reporters 
in the methods of resistance used by palestinians and in the 
ways the israeli government deals with the resistance we 
experienced an extraordinary sense of being at home he said 
in the west bank city of bethlehem hundreds of christian 
pilgrims marked christmas with a visit to st catherines basilica 
in manger square the legendary site of jesus birth 
israeli soldiers removed barricades and metal detectors from 
manger square after christmas eve passed without incident but the 
military presence was heavy and at least 50 paratroopers and 
soldiers from the elite givati brigade patrolled the square 
i dont like it but i guess its for security said sara 
paredes 20 of fort leavenworth kan as she stood outside the 
church of the nativity 
paredes said making a pilgrimage to bethlehem was a dream 
for her but added that she would like to return in the future when 
tensions and security are lessened and when i can find a better 
christmas 
twenty palestinians were wounded after troops opened fire on 
stonethrowing demonstrators in the gaza strip arab reports said 
the army said it was investigating the reports 
tutu drew harsh criticism after he refused to meet with a 
delegation of ethiopian jews saying their visit to the st george 
anglican church in east jerusalem was not on his schedule 
he did not have time to sit with us even for two or three 
minutes yitzhak rahamim a spokesman for the ethiopian 
immigrants association told a reporter outside the church i 
heard he had time to meet with palestinians but not with jews 
even with us from africa 
tutu met monday with a group of prominent palestinian leaders to 
discuss the situation in the occupied territories where 
palestinians began their revolt against israeli rule in december 
1987 
the jerusalembased international christian embassy headed by 
willem van der hoeven a dutch evangelist cleric published a 
statement denouncing tutus repeated expressions of support for 
palestinians 
in the statement that was also sent to israeli leaders van der 
hoeven wrote we specifically apologize for the remarks made by 
the visiting anglican archbishop desmond tutuwe bow our heads in 
shame 
tutus endorsement of a palestinian state has alienated many 
israelis and israels two chief rabbis refused to meet with the 
anglican human rights leader 
when asked to comment on criticisms of his visit tutu replied 
the biblespeaks about israel as being an agent of god for 
establishing justice and peace and there is no way i am going to 
say the way israel is treating palestinians is just and if they 
revile me for that tough luck

queen elizabeth ii said in her annual christmas 
broadcast that it would be splendid if all nations learned to 
love their neighbors and united to save the earth from further 
environmental damage 
the queen also spoke of the exciting news that barriers 
between eastern and western europe were coming down and people on 
both sides were beginning to think about their future as neighbors 
its still hard for us to be sure what is going to happen as a 
result of these great events but it would be splendid to think 
that in the last years of the 20th century christs message about 
loving our neighbors as ourselves might at last be heeded she 
said in the 11minute broadcast 
she addressed her message particularly to children in the 
49nation commonwealth of britain and its former colonies saying 
they brought out the best in grownups and part of that best in 
us could be a particular tenderness towards this earth which we 
share as human beings 
if we can reduce selfishness and jealously dishonesty and 
injustice the 90s can become a time of peace and tranquillity for 
children and grownups and a time for working together for the 
benefit of our planet as a whole 
the queen broke a tradition of keeping her message secret until 
christmas by delivering part of it to an audience of 6000 at 
londons royal albert hall last tuesday night 
spotlighted in the halls vast arena the queen explained that 
she wanted to use the presence of 2000 children at the 
fundraising gala for the save the children charity to send a 
special message to all children in the commonwealth 
a group of youngsters whose parents work for commonwealth high 
commissions or embassies in london were allowed to ask the queen 
questions during intermission 
she told them she found her crown quite heavy admitted she 
was sometimes nervous in front of big crowds and said she liked to 
believe in father christmas the english name for santa claus 
one small girl asked do you like being the queen the queen 
replied indirectly saying its a very busy life 
another child asked rather shyly what are you going to buy 
prince william for christmas 
with the 7yearold prince son of prince charles and princess 
diana hovering in the background the queen neatly sidestepped 
replying i dont think i had better say it too loudly he might 
hear me 
in her message the queen said she received many letters from 
people worried about the greenhouse effect caused by warming of the 
earths atmosphere crop devastation caused by floods and drought 
and the destruction of forests 
these problems make neighboring cooperation throughout the 
world a pressing necessity she said the great thing to 
remember is that it is not too late to reduce the damage if we 
change our attitudes and behavior

southern cities and the carolinas dug out after a rare december 
blizzard

of last weeks surge of arctic air that broke hundreds of low 
temperature records nebraska warmed into the 40s and it was the 
first time in 10 days that indiana had no readings at or near zero

southward into minnesota with wind chills of about 40 below zero

in 92 hours the mercury had been above freezing temperatures also 
eased in florida but the day started with a record of 30 degrees 
in miami 
the temperature fell to an alltime record low of zero at the 
airport for wilmington nc which was partly paralyzed by the 
cold and the record 15 inches of snow that fell sunday the 
previous alltime low at wilmington of 5 above had stood since 
february 1899 
other record lows monday all in florida were 29 at fort 
lauderdale 46 at key west and a recordtying 33 at miami beach 
the national weather service reported a far cry from last week 
when temperatures hit record lows in more than 100 cities a day 
mondays low for the lower 48 states was 17 degrees below zero at 
houlton maine 
elsewhere the cold prevented the annual reenactment of george 
washingtons famous revolutionary war crossing of the delaware 
river to capture british troops at trenton nj we couldnt get

the north coast which received well over a foot of snow in places 
melting snow was expected to refreeze on roads and make driving 
treacherous during the night

some instances blackouts as utilities tried to keep up with demand 
for electricity 
some people went without power for as long as 12 hours you 
cant heat a house cook a meal or take a shower said ellen

supplies 
we are drawing from all of our emergency supply sources 
said charles zeigler chairman and president of public service co 
of north carolina 
numerous burst water pipes were reported because of the cold 
and water pressure was low partly from people letting water run to 
avoid frozen pipes

apparently there is a lot of iced fruit said dick whalley 
a spokesman for florida citrus mutual the states big grower 
cooperative 
but strawberries fared better said roy parke of parkesdale 
farms a berry farmer in plant city fla a lack of wind allows 
irrigation systems to build an even layer of ice on fragile plants 
to hold them at 32 degrees wind scatters the water from 
sprinklers allowing lower temperatures to get to the plants 
we got good ice cover and i figure ill be able to save 80 
percent parke said monday

fruit that wasnt harvested before friday and saturdays cold can

manuel antonio noriegas decision to seek 
asylum at the vaticans embassy in panama city forces president 
bush into the thicket of diplomacy and international law in pursuit 
of his goal of bringing the deposed dictator to trial on drug 
trafficking charges 
now its up to the lawyers and the diplomats summed up 
pentagon chief dick cheney whose troops tried but failed to 
capture the elusive dictator in more than four days of searching 
when noriega drove up to the vatican embassy in panama city on 
christmas eve bush accomplished a central goal of the invasion he 
ordered last week removing the indicted drug trafficker from all 
power in panama 
but how bush panamas usbacked government the vatican and 
other nations handle the next step could determine not only 
noriegas fate but the future of the strategically placed isthmus 
for years to come 
us interests appear to be best served by noriegas speedy 
removal from the papal nunciature where he is protected by 
diplomatic immunity and by the spotlight of international 
attention as long as he stays attention could be diverted from 
us efforts to restore order to the devastated country 
in talks with vatican officials in rome on monday the bush 
administration delivered a forceful message demanding noriega be 
turned over to us custody the message was delivered in 
extraordinarily tough terms said one official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
but the vatican which has offered haven to noriegas foes in 
recent months would have to reverse centuries of practice and 
diplomatic principle to hand the general to the united states 
against his will 
asked if a simple turnover were foreseeable vatican spokesman 
joaquin navarro said well i dont think so there isnt an 
extradition treaty or anything 
bush who has held several diplomatic jobs in his career 
presumably understands the complexities well the united states has 
been sheltering chinese dissident fang lizhi in the us embassy in 
beijing for many months despite chinese demands to hand him over 
bush could ask the government of usbacked president guillermo 
endara to demand noriega be handed over by the vatican but endara 
has already said his country is forbidden by its constitution to 
extradite any panamanian citizen to the united states 
another solution could lie in removing noriega from panama to a 
third country the united states set a precedent for such a 
scenario when it negotiated with noriega in 1988 after he was 
indicted in florida and again as recently as october 
state department officials were apparently prepared to drop 
their demand for bringing noriega to the united states if he agreed 
to resign his posts later the us upped its ante and demanded 
that noriega leave panama 
spain cuba and the dominican republic where noriega has a 
daughter and some real estate have been mentioned as possible 
exiles until now noriega has refused to go 
but in any deal noriega works out he would likely demand a 
promise that he not be extradited to the united states 
that could create a problem with spain which has a 1970 
extradition treaty with the united states 
foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez said monday that 
spain would not be a convenient place for noriega to seek asylum 
because he would have to be turned over to us authorities on 
drugrelated charges 
an exile closer to home could prove troublesome if it left 
noriega close enough to foment resistance to the new panamanian 
government among former loyalists of his regime 
part of the deal would have to be that he promise not to 
interfere in panamanian politics said james goodby a professor 
of diplomacy at georgetown university the farther away he goes 
the better 
even if noriega were brought to this country other 
complications could stand in the way of a trial 
raymond takiff noriegas attorney in miami said prosecution 
would result in sensitive information being divulged about 
noriegas long association with the cia federal prosecutors 
familiar with the case say they believe a trial could go forward 
the nature of the sensitive information could include material 
relating to bush himself 
according to kevin buckley who is writing a book for simon and 
schuster about noriega the deposed panamanian leader and bush 
first met in 1976 bush headed the cia at the time and buckley 
said noriega commanded his countrys intelligence services 
in 1983 bush visited noriega in panama and reportedly hinted 
that if the general helped the usbacked nicaraguan contra 
rebels the united states would turn a blind eye to his drug profit 
laundering buckley said bush has denied making any such promise 
noriega also met in 1985 aboard a yacht with former white house 
aide oliver north to discuss help for the contras according to 
buckley 
he noriega knows where a lot of skeletons are buried in 
central america and some of them may be very close to bushs 
office said william schneider a senior fellow at the american 
enterprise institute

a strong earthquake struck the ungava peninsula 
of northern quebec baffin island and the eastern part of the 
northwest territories on christmas morning but no damage or 
injuries were reported 
the quake which occurred at 924 am est measured 62 on the 
richter scale said seismologist robert north of the ottawa office 
of the geological survey of canada 
an earthquake over 6 points is a serious earthquake and can 
cause severe damage in a populated area north said 
but fortunately the quake took place in a sparsely 
populated area which has no large buildings so the effects should 
not cause any personal damage he said 
north said his office received a telephone call from the inuit 
village of igloolik to report the quake iqaluit on frobisher bay 
in baffin island also felt the temblor 
father paulemile tremblay director of the seismological 
observatory at montreals jean de brebeuf college said the 
epicenter was in the eastern part of the northwest territories and 
the quake was felt within a 620mile radius 
we have been noticing lowlevel tremors in that area for some 
time so we were not surprised by the strong earthquake which 
occurred on christmas morning he said 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph

a poet who had described deposed 
president nicolae ceausescu as the most beloved son of the 
romanian people tried to take refuge monday in the us embassy 
to escape a crowd that wanted to lynch him 
but army soldiers intervened and took adrian paunescu away after 
embassy personnel would not let him enter witnesses said 
paunescu in his mid40s for years was responsible for running 
song to romania a festival of music and poetry eulogizing 
ceausescu and his wife elena 
ceausescu was overthrown friday and captured a day later by the 
army following a popular uprising the couple was executed monday 
state radio said after being tried and found guilty of grave 
crimes including the deaths of 60000 protesters and the 
plundering of 1 billion in public money 
paunescu who owns a 10room villa in downtown bucharest 
complete with a swimming pool and sauna was considered ceausescus 
court poet for many years until he fell into disfavor in 1985 when 
police reportedly found he was involved in orgies at home and had 
illegally built an alpine retreat at breaza north of bucharest 
under ceausescu romanians were allowed to own just one home 
when it became apparent that ceausescus demotion would be 
imminent paunescu tried to address a rally in the palace square in 
front of the communist party headquarters friday to criticize the 
dictator but was booed by the crowd 
in 1973 when bookstores were filled with volumes bearing 
ceausescus picture entitled homage paunescu said the book was 
issued as a rousing evocation of the reverberations produced in 
the mind of the romanian nation by the anniversary of the most 
beloved son of the romanian people president nicolae ceausescu

investigators on monday slogged through 
firefighting foam and charred remains of storage tanks damaged in a 
deadly explosion and fire at the nations second largest 
petrochemical refinery 
the intense blaze at the exxon refinery burned for 15 hours 
before it was extinguished at 5 am monday said company spokesman 
dave gardner 
one contract worker died sunday when his pickup caught fire in 
the explosion crews searched monday for an exxon employee missing 
following the blast gardner said 
flames engulfed eight storage tanks holding more than 4 million 
gallons of oil and lubricants and two separator units which 
remove water from oil officials said 
it was believed to have been ignited by a gas release but what 
caused the release was under investigation said plant manager ed 
galante 
a maintenance work center a building that was in the area 
that used to be a small office satellite complex was destroyed 
gardner said luckily there was nobody in there 
production was halted at the refinery which has a capacity of 
455000 barrels more than 19 million gallons of crude oil a 
day exxon spokesman ron embry said he did not know whether that 
would worsen any shortages of home heating oil during the nations 
recordsetting cold snap 
generally the limit to fuel oil seems to be due to 
transportation problems in bad weather and not supplies embry 
said 
two investigative teams have been assembled one to determine 
the cause of the accident and another to assess the damage and 
decide whats necessary to get the plant back in operation gardner 
said 
it will take some time and some effort at this point its 
almost impossible to say how much he said 
the worker killed in the blast was identified as mechanic harold 
guillory 31 of irwinville an employee for contractor vernon 
mckenny enterprise gardner said 
guillory died when his pickup truck caught fire 100 to 200 feet 
from the explosion gardner said 
the missing exxon worker was not identified and no other 
information about his disappearance was released his family has 
been notified gardner said 
three exxon employees and four contract workers were treated for 
injuries at baton rouge hospitals and released sunday gardner said 
numerous employees had cuts and bruises but didnt go to 
hospitals galante said 
a skeleton crew was on duty because of the christmas holiday he 
said 
the blast shattered windows up to six miles away and was felt up 
to 15 miles away the fire sent a plume of thick black smoke 500 
feet into the air 
gov buddy roemer called out 50 national guardsmen overnight to 
prevent looting of stores where plateglass windows were blown out 
initial reports said looters hit some stores but police lt willie 
stevens said monday that there had been no arrests 
the refinery on the mississippi river in north baton rouge has 
been on the site since 1909 
petroleum inspectors david abshire and wiley aymond said they 
were 300 feet from the tanks when they exploded 
the explosion caved in the whole side of the building 
abshire said we would have been worse off if we were inside 
because of the all the flying glass 
when i looked up i saw the sky full of stuff pieces of wood 
insulation just a sky full of stuff he said i was in a daze 
and was just running in circles looking for some place to get away 
from it all and there was no place to go 
the blast temporarily knocked out electricity and telephone 
service in the area and forced the closure of a section of nearby 
interstate 110 for the night 
state department of environmental quality workers monitored air 
outside the plant but roemer said the burning chemicals were all 
nontoxic hydrocarbons propane ethane and diesel fuels an area 
around the area was closed to incoming traffic for a time but no 
evacuations were ordered

the government said monday it 
foiled an attempted coup against the 2yearold government of 
president blaise compaore but denied reports that it executed 
seven of those arrested 
justice minister antoine komi sambo told a news conference 
foreign mercenaries were among those arrested but he refused 
to provide any details 
he said those arrested would be brought before the courts of 
this landlocked west african former french colony once known as 
upper volta 
burkina faso with a population of more than 85 million gained 
independence in 1960 
in paris the burkinabe league of human rights issued a 
statement protesting the arrests and what it called repression by 
the countrys military dictatorship 
as of dec 25 more than 50 people have been arrested and 
their number is likely to double in the days to come according to 
disquieting information coming from burkina faso it said 
earlier monday the french news agency agence francepresse 
quoted what it called wellinformed sources in ouagadougou as 
saying seven people were executed sunday night and monday morning 
and about 30 others mostly soldiers were arrested 
compaore took power oct 15 1987 in a military coup that left 
president thomas sankara among those slain officials reported 
another aborted coup last september and said four alleged plotters 
were executed summarily including the men who were no 2 and no 3 
in compaores government 
the justice minister did not disclose on monday when any of the

with us troops christmas eve said at a news briefing monday that 
noriega had been very skillful in eluding capture and moving 
every night 
cheney called the us invasion the most surgical operation of 
its size ever carried out not only by our forces but by anybody 
elses forces 
after congratulating us soldiers on their mission and touring 
noriegas battered headquarters cheney met with leaders of the new 
usbacked government he reiterated washingtons desire to have 
noriega brought for trial in the united states 
the area of monday nights fighting includes the cuban embassy 
which is surrounded by us troops as well as the foreign 
ministry where the government of new president guillermo endara 
has set up shop

embassys personnel lay on the floor during the firing which 
slackened after 45 minutes he said spanish ambassador tomas lozano 
called a us colonel in charge of operations in the area and the 
colonel said im on the ground too

expressing the will to end the conflict between us soldiers 
and his supporters 
vatican panamanian and us officials could not say if noriega 
would be handed over to the united states where he faces drug 
charges or be given asylum in another country the vatican has no

blowing into the place 
us soldiers had surrounded the cuban libyan and nicaraguan 
embassies to prevent noriega from seeking refuge there but no us 
troops were around the vatican building when noriega drove in 
sunday afternoon

carrying out our basic mission we could not come in and 
surround literally every embassy in panama in the hopes that you 
could head off mr noriega 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said monday the concerned 
parties would examine noriegas case asked if a simple 
turnover of noriega to the united states was foreseeable navarro 
replied well i dont think so there isnt an extradition 
treaty or anything 
the vatican depicted the situation as an opportunity to bring 
peace to panama and indicated it knew of noriegas position before 
he showed up sunday afternoon 
i can announce with satisfaction that the conflict in panama 
seems to be nearing a solution without further shedding of blood

a christmas eve fire that killed 16 
and injured dozens at a highrise retirement home might have been 
worse if so many people hadnt been away for the holiday 
authorities said monday 
officials accounted for 10 of 11 residents who had been listed 
as missing after the blaze at the 11story john sevier retirement 
center the 11th person is also believed to have been away at the 
time they said 
i cant think of a worse time on christmas eve said pc 
snapp mayor of this town of 40000 on the other hand it could 
have been a good time because a number of people had gone to visit 
relatives 
the blaze surged through the lower floors of the brick building 
sending thick smoke to the floors above residents of upper floors 
waved flashlights and screamed for help from the windows of their 
smokefilled apartments 
about 50 people were injured including about 15 firefighters 
some of whom also suffered frostbite most were treated for smoke 
inhalation and released at least one person was seriously burned 
said dan blevins spokesman for northside hospital 
the cause of the fire was under investigation 
my personal feelings are it was an accidental fire said 
lt george leonard city fire marshal 
the building a former hotel renovated in 1977 and turned into 
an apartments for retirees didnt have sprinklers but had water 
hoses on each floor 
the fire marshal said the building complied with fire codes at 
the time of its renovation if the building were renovated today it 
would be required to have sprinklers basically it was not an 
unsafe building leonard said 
the john sevier partnership which owns the building had 
planned to have a 100000 sprinkler system installed in the 
spring said grant trivett of mampm properties which manages the 
building 
we didnt feel uncomfortable with the safety of the building 
we just had seen fires basically on tv and other places the 
comment was made that the sprinkler system would have been a 
benefit trivett said monday night 
if its renovated it will be renovated to todays codes you 
know it would be a shame to not utilize the building in the 
future trivett said 
in october a resident died in a fire in the building when a 
kerosene heater apparently mistakenly filled with gasoline 
ignited his apartment 
two of the victims sunday were people who had been visiting 
residents when the fire alarms sounded at 511 pm in all nearly 
150 people lived in the building 
as many as 250 firefighters fought the fire which was brought 
under control by midnight 
fire chief doug buckles said the fire was believed to have begun 
on the first or second story but the deaths occurred on the higher 
floors probably because of the smoke 
we began hearing fire alarms go off but they were not loud 
enough that we realized what it was said ben peterson who was 
visiting his grandmother on the fourth floor by the time we 
finally realized what it was and went into the hall it was full of 
smoke 
it was terrible last night it was a terrible ordeal said 
samuel e williams 52 
im like other people id like to know what caused that fire 
because it was so fast it was just like that williams said 
snapping his fingers he said he escaped from his thirdfloor 
apartment through billowing smoke 
what really got to me after we were out on the street and 
looking up he said we saw people laying out their windows 
saying help me and we couldnt help them

the bush administration demanded in 
extraordinarily tough terms monday that vatican authorities turn 
deposed panamanian dictator manuel antonio noriega over to us 
custody a state department source said 
negotiations have brought a mexican standoff a 
confrontation that neither side can win the official said with 
church authorities rebuffing the request and trying thus far 
unsuccessfully to find a country to take noriega from his 
sanctuary in the vatican embassy in panama city 
while the negotiations went on president bush summoned national 
security adviser brent scowcroft to his mountain retreat christmas 
day to discuss diplomatic options for dislodging noriega to bring 
him to trial on drug charges in the united states 
and speaking in panama defense secretary dick cheney said he 
would like to bring us troops home as soon as possible but 
added they will stay as long as they are needed we dont want 
to leave too soon before the task is accomplished 
roughly 26000 us troops are in panama more than double the 
12000 normally based there 
the state department source speaking only on condition he not 
be named said the us demand for custody of noriega has been 
delivered to the vatican in extraordinarily tough terms 
but he said the vatican has been contacting a number of latin 
american and european countries hoping that one will agree to 
accept noriega the officials didnt mention names but countries 
that have surfaced as possible refuges include spain cuba and the 
dominican republic 
he has no place to go yet the official said nobody wants 
him 
the official said most of the discussions have been carried out 
between the state department and church officials at the vatican 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said in rome it was too early 
to say whether he would be handed over to the united states or the 
new usbacked government in panama or given passage to another 
country 
scowcroft was asked to come to camp david in the catoctin 
mountains of maryland where the president was spending a holiday 
weekend with his wife five children and 11 grandchildren the 
white house said secretary of state james a baker iii was keeping 
in touch by telephone from houston where he spent the holiday

been indicted with noriega on drugrelated charges in florida was 
escorted to miami on monday by us drug enforcement agents the 
justice department said lt col luis del cid surrendered to us 
forces in panama on saturday 
noriega entered the vatican embassy on sunday after eluding 
capture by american troops in the four days since their invasion 
despite a 1 million bounty offered by the united states 
that relieved us forces in panama from their intensive and 
frustrating task of locating him but it also set in motion a 
diplomatic and legal ballet now its up to the lawyers and the 
diplomats said defense secretary dick cheney in panama for a 
brief onsite inspection 
sanctuary in embassies usually is granted for people seeking 
political asylum not protection from criminal prosecution 
we want him in the united states to face the indictments 
said a member of the state departments task force on panama we 
are exploring avenues by which this might be done said the 
official who insisted on anonymity 
reports from panama mentioned the possibility that noriega wants 
to go to spain or cuba when us officials were negotiating with 
the panamanian strongman after his indictment in this country last 
year he reportedly expressed a willingness to go into exile in 
either country but in the end did not 
miguel gil a spokesman for the spanish government said no 
official overtures had been made by noriega and foreign minister 
francisco fernandez ordonez said the case was a matter to be 
decided between the united states and the vatican spains national 
news agency efe later reported him as saying spain is not the 
ideal country to accept noriega because of its extradition 
agreement with the united states which includes drug trafficking 
cases 
in vatican city spokesman joaquin navarro said the concerned 
parties would examine the case as soon as possible and that 
noriegas legal status was still being determined 
navarro was asked in a television interview if a simple 
turnover of noriega to the united states was foreseeable 
well i dont think so said navarro there isnt an 
extradition treaty or anything 
the pentagon issued new casualty figures in panama the death 
toll of us troops stood at 23 revised downward by one from 
sunday because one victim was counted by two different units 
there were 303 us wounded none missing and two dependents 
killed lundquist said

the hunt for manuel antonio noriega is over 
but president bush still is searching for ways to bring the 
expanamanian dictator to justice even though he is now closeted in 
the vatican ambassadors home a white house spokesman says 
bush learned at camp david late sunday afternoon shortly after 
returning from a pentagon briefing that noriega had surfaced 
seeking asylum at the residence of the papal nuncio in panama city 
after five days on the run 
the first reaction from white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
was that noriegas reign of terror is over

and us authorities are weighing options for dealing with the 
fugitive exdictator

vicious weekend street battles and christmas carols rang out for

300000 were wounded since the popular revolt that ousted communist 
president nicolae ceausescu began dec 15 
hungarys budapest radio and the british broadcasting corp

sources in bucharest but giving no details 
the reports like others on casualties was impossible to verify 
independently but if accurate the romanian uprising would be the 
bloodiest anticommunist revolt ever its death toll far eclipsing 
that of the hungarian revolution of 1956 in which about 30000 
people are believed to have lost their lives

and violence against the repression enforced by the 24year 
dictatorship of nicolae ceausescu

monday after a secret trial on charges of particularly grave crimes 
against the people 
no other east european country revolting in the name of 
democracy has reacted in this way but no other east european 
country had a ceausescu whose unparalleled personality cult 
trumpeted his golden era while imposing more and more hardship 
as mandated debt repayment and industrialization programs 
brought hardship to every romanian dissent was largely repressed 
by his dreaded securitate a massive network of at least 700000 
people 
workers who dared to protest disappeared mysteriously 
intellectuals with a higher profile in society faced prison 
mental hospital internal exile or house arrest

manuel antonio noriegas decision to seek 
asylum at the vaticans embassy in panama city forces president 
bush into the thicket of diplomacy and international law in pursuit 
of his goal of bringing the deposed dictator to trial on drug 
trafficking charges 
now its up to the lawyers and the diplomats summed up 
pentagon chief dick cheney whose troops tried but failed to 
capture the elusive dictator in more than four days of searching 
when noriega drove up to the vatican embassy in panama city on 
christmas eve bush accomplished a central goal of the invasion he 
ordered last week removing the indicted drug trafficker from all 
power in panama 
but how bush panamas usbacked government the vatican and 
other nations handle the next step could determine not only 
noriegas fate but the future of the strategically placed isthmus 
for years to come 
us interests appear to be best served by noriegas speedy 
removal from the papal nunciature where he is protected by 
diplomatic immunity and by the spotlight of international 
attention as long as he stays attention could be diverted from 
us efforts to restore order to the devastated country 
the white house said sunday it still hopes to bring noriega to 
justice he was indicted in florida on federal charges in 1988

apartheid but his performance since his inauguration has raised 
hopes higher than ever for peaceful change 
even the whiterun governments most militant opponents 
acknowledge a dramatic shift in mood since pw botha quit the 
presidency they say de klerks conciliatory moves resulted from 
pressure rather than conviction but many antiapartheid leaders 
now believe for the first time that the government sincerely 
wants to negotiate with them 
exit a president named pw to be replaced by one named fw 
remarkable what a difference that one letter made wrote the

continue to use our assets to promote their areas said carol

considering trademarking the tetons im only halfjoking

the ingredients of a credibility gap are 
showing in the tortuous white house explanations of administration 
missions and gestures toward china a private easing of publicly 
declared sanctions it is an account heavy with fine print and fine 
distinctions as president bush and his spokesmen argue that 
americans were not misled by secret diplomacy 
administrations that offered hairsplitting definitions in 
defense of their actions have had trouble before lyndon b 
johnsons credibility problems began when he shaded meanings to 
create impressions that would build support for his policies 
the controversy over the bush administrations secret and 
secretive china overtures is not ended only on hold because of 
us intervention in panama it will be revived with an effort to 
override a bush veto of a bill extending visas for chinese students 
due soon after congress reconvenes jan 23 
the administrations sanctions were imposed june 20 after the 
massacre in tiananmen square that began chinas repression of 
democracy demonstrators bush was said to have suspended all 
highlevel exchanges of government officials while halting 
military exchanges and postponing international loans to beijing 
but within two weeks of that decree bush secretly sent two top 
officials to beijing on a mission disclosed dec 18 after it had 
been reported by cable news network the same two men brent 
scowcroft the national security adviser and lawrence s 
eagleburger the deputy secretary of state went to china on dec 2 
and 3 that trip was announced at 2 oclock on a saturday morning 
after they had arrived bushs spokesman said the chinese wanted it 
done that way 
the second trip had stirred sharp criticism from congressional 
democrats who said the chinese hadnt done anything to warrant an 
easing of the sanctions which some critics had said were too tame 
in the first place 
bush said he ordered those contacts with china because improved 
relations serve us interests and because a nation of more than 1 
billion people should not be isolated 
the initial secret trip came to light a day after the 
administration sent eagleburger to brief a top congressional 
democrat on the december mission to beijing while withholding 
word of the one in july senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine said he was astonished to learn of the july mission the 
white house said bush sent scowcroft on that one to tell the 
chinese of his shock and concern at the tiananmen killings 
bush by then had ordered the sanctions he and scowcroft had 
confronted the chinese ambassador with the same message at a white 
house meeting 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said scowcroft was sent to 
beijing to make sure that the chinese did not think this was just 
a public statement 
he said bush considered it important that the july contact be 
kept secret from congress as well as from the public to the 
suggestion that the scowcroft message might have been reinforced 
had congress been advised and joined in the reproof fitzwater 
replied 
it might carry more weight in the american way of thinking 
but not in the china way of thinking 
and bush on thursday said people should pay close attention to 
the words he uses insisting that he never precluded highlevel 
contacts with the chinese i said no highlevel exchanges he 
clarified so please look at it carefully 
secretary of state james a baker iii wasnt careful enough he 
said in a dec 10 television interview that the latest 
scowcrofteagleburger visit was the first time weve had 
highlevel us officials go to the peoples republic of china 
since the sanctions after the secret trip was disclosed the state 
department said baker regrets that he may have misled some 
people 
there was a further easing of the sanctions dec 19 when bush 
lifted a ban on loans that promote us business in china and 
approved the export of three communications satellites that are to 
be launched into orbit by the chinese 
bush insisted thursday that his policies were the right ones 
i know how china works he said see what we can do make a 
representation of how strongly we feel against human rights abuse 
but see what its going to take to go forward 
he also has said that reciprocal chinese actions would silence 
some of his critics i notice now that some of the critics who 
were so opposed using this fantastically diabolically antime 
language they come up now and say well if you get a b and c 
then it would be all right 
that may be so but the chinese havent offered any of the above 
on thursday beijing condemned the us move into panama as a 
shocking violation of international law and demanded immediate 
withdrawal
