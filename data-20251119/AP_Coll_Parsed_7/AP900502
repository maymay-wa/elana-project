secretary of state james a baker iii 
said wednesday that nato membership for a unified germany should be 
up to the alliance not the soviet union 
but baker said he is willing to consider the kremlins views 
when he meets with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
friday and saturday in bonn 
partly to persuade the soviet union to accept a unified germany 
in nato baker will tell nato foreign ministers that the united 
states will withdraw some nuclear artillery from germany and 
favors prompt negotiations to eliminate other groundbased nuclear 
weapons from europe the washington post said in thursday editions 
while shevardnadze has recently signaled a willingness to drop 
the soviet demand that a unified germany be neutral soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev said last weekend that his countrys 
attitude toward unilateral unbalanced proposals for the entry of 
a future german state into nato remains negative 
west germany is the strongest us ally in the north atlantic 
treaty organization similarly east germany was the staunchest 
soviet ally in the warsaw pact until its conversion to 
westernstyle political democracy earlier this year 
shortly after baker left washington officials of the two german 
states announced a tentative agreement on a plan for merging their 
economies settling basic differences over how the nations should 
assess the costs of unification 
todays agreement announced by officials in east berlin sets 
the stage for a full merger of the economies of the two nations on 
july 2 
west german chancellor helmut kohl has predicted political union 
by the end of 1991 
baker launching a fiveday european trip in which germanys 
future will be the predominant issue said the size of the german 
army is a legitimate topic for eastwest negotiators meeting in 
vienna 
but he said the question whether the unified germany should 
be a member of nato is a question that is properly decided in nato 
with the participation of a united germany 
west germany has become more and more reluctant to be host for 
shortrange nuclear weapons because they would almost inevitably 
explode on german territory if used 
gerhard stoltenberg the west german defense minister said in a 
speech in washington on tuesday that nato might move to get rid of 
all groundbased nuclear weapons leaving only airlaunched 
missiles and bombs in its nuclear arsenal 
according to the international institute for strategic studies 
in london the united states and its allies in 1989 deployed 2872 
artillery pieces in nato theoretically capable of firing nuclear 
shells while warsaw pact powers had 2070 
the united states has been retiring some older 8inch guns 
recently and officials disclosed last month that the pentagon had 
put on hold development of a new edition of the nucleartipped 
lance missile 
the united states has expected to begin talks with the soviet 
union on shortrange nuclear weapons in europe later this year 
after conclusion of an agreement on convention weapons 
baker spoke to reporters aboard his air force jet en route to a 
refueling stop here from washington he then flew to brussels for 
sessions thursday with nato and european community foreign 
ministers 
last saturday the 12nation community took strides toward 
political union by 1993 
france and west germany led the drive britain denmark and 
portugal are hesitant the bush administration has not taken a 
position and baker declined to be drawn into the matter 
baker will fly to bonn on friday for separate sessions with west 
german foreign minister hans dietrich genscher and with 
shevardnadze 
on saturday the foreign ministers of the two germanys and the 
four wartime allies the united states britain france and the 
soviet union will meet 
among the issues baker said they will take up is how to 
relinquish fourpower control of berlin which they have held since 
germanys defeat in 1945 
but germanys membership in nato isnt a proper subject for 
discussion with the soviets baker said 
the fact of the matter is you cant take a decision of that 
nature without having the members of the alliance sitting at the 
table 
at the meeting of the four wartime allies and the two germanys 
there will be indeed a very full and complete discussion of 
that issue because that is one of the foremost issues right now 
that separate the alliance from the position of the soviet union 
baker said 
the prospect of a united and stronger germany in nato has caused 
alarm in moscow and stirred memories of world war ii in which an 
estimated 20 million soviets perished 
at times soviet leaders have called for dissolving both nato 
and the warsaw pact shevardnadze said last week that germany 
should become a testing ground of new forms of eastwest 
security cooperation 
the soviet foreign minister also has floated the idea of the 
unified germany being a member of both alliances the western 
allies meanwhile have suggested keeping nato troops out of what 
is now east germany

a minister pleaded with mourners at a 
funeral wednesday for one of three teenage suicides to put aside 
questions about what led to their deaths and focus instead on 
avoiding the same path 
thomas smith 17 was the first of three suicides among sheridan 
high school students in two days and counselors for their 
classmates were on 24hour call about 80 students missed classes 
wednesday about 30 more than usual school officials said 
some of the absentees were among about 250 people packed into 
the buie funeral home chapel to hear the rev dennis moon urge them 
to cling to god as they grieved over smiths death 
bringing back tommy is beyond our control but going with him 
is still our choice said moon during the 20minute service 
we dont need to ask god why he would let this happen said 
moon of the landmark baptist chruch we need to ask god what 
would he want us to do 
a graveside service followed at a cemetery in grapevine some 23 
miles from sheridan 
five members of the schools rotc of which smith was a member 
stood at attention about five feet from the casket a man walked up 
to each youth removed a white flower from his uniform lapel and 
set it in the youths white gloves 
as the gathering broke up four young men approached a reporter 
and three photographers and demanded their film the photographers 
refused two of the youths threw rocks at the car as it left 
on monday smith stood in front of his american history class 
told a female classmate i love you pulled a gun out of his 
pants and shot himself 
later that day chidester 19 of the grapevine community a 
friend of smiths died of a gunshot wound he left a note that 
said i cant go on any longer according to police 
on tuesday the body of jerry paul mccool a 17yearold 
sophomore was discovered in his home by his father mccool who 
also had been shot knew smith and chidester but wasnt close with 
them officials said 
all three deaths were ruled suicides said grant county sheriff 
cary clark 
in addition to those deaths a 17yearold classmate shot 
himself to death march 28 and three other county residents ages 
22 40 and 82 have killed themselves since jan 23 
hours after the latest shooting parents and students packed the 
schools 1000seat auditorium to discuss the suicides some held 
hands some cried 
about 60 counselors and clergymen from around the state had 
arrived at the normally quiet bedroom community 30 miles south of 
little rock 
school superintendent david robinson said students met with 
counselors in group sessions and oneonone wednesday 
obviously school as such is not occurring at the moment 
robinson said actually its more like a massive counseling 
session 
later wednesday he said the mood had improved the bottom 
line is we feel pretty good about how people are recovering the 
kids have told us theyre ready to try to get back to normal 
some said the atmosphere was less somber at the school wednesday 
than earlier in the week 
lisa deal 18 a senior and president of the student council 
said even though the mood had improved the community had a long 
way to go to get over the series of deaths 
its scary knowing your friends would go to these 
extremes she said ms deal said she was an acquaintance of 
smith and chidester 
the students really opened up here today she said of the 
counseling sessions yesterday was bad for us because it was 
newer everybody had just heard about it 
robinson who held a news conference wednesday morning said he 
also felt the situation was getting better 
i think the fact that our students were involved in a kind of 
organized session this morning and were able to express their 
feelings helped he said

the extradition of a man who says he masterminded the abduction of 
a mexican doctor accused of participating in the death of a us 
drug agent 
mexican attorney general enrique alvarez del castillo said 
extradition papers are being prepared for antonio garate 
bustamante who claims to be a drug enforcement administration 
operative who organized the kidnapping of dr humberto alvarez 
machain in guadalajara on april 2 
us attorney general dick thornburgh met with alvarez del 
castillo for more than an hour discussing drug enforcement efforts 
as well as the current controversy over the alleged abduction of 
alvarez 
we have in process a corresponding arrest order to solicit his 
garates extradition from whichever country he is found 
alvarez del castillo said in spanish after the meeting 
thornburgh refused to say whether alvarez del castillo asked for 
garates extradition during the meeting adding that such requests 
would be made through the us state department 
thornburgh said the matter of alvarez arrest will be dealt with 
during a may 25 federal court hearing in los angeles 
garate a former mexican police officer told the los angeles 
times last week that he arranged the abduction of alvarez with 
approval from the dea garate said 10 mexicans were promised 
100000 for alvarez capture and delivery to el paso texas

scene arias said that man jorge cobarrubias an expoliceman 
from the mexican state of hidalgo said he lined up the others to

united states and mexico which has threatened to stop cooperating 
in the fight against drug trafficking 
arias also said that mexico wants an agreement with the united 
states that would allow mexican drug agents to operate in the 
united states the same way us dea agents work in mexico there

states and gustavo petricioli of mexico were at wednesdays

us rep donald lukens convicted of a 
sex offense that threatens his career is taking his case to the 
voters 
i apologize i made a dumb mistake im sorry the 
republican said wednesday in announcing for reelection less than a 
week before tuesdays primary 
the 59yearold divorced congressman was convicted of a 
misdemeanor charge last year of contributing to the unrulinesss of 
a minor for having sex with a 16yearold girl at his columbus 
apartment in 1988 
he was sentenced to 30 days in jail and fined 500 but is free 
on appeal 
robert bennett chairman of the ohio republican party said 
lukens displayed a lapse of morals and he repeated a call for 
the congressman to resign this is not a political matter its a 
moral matter he said 
on may 8 i am sure the voters will do the right thing and say 
goodbye to donald buz lukens bennett said 
ohio democratic party chairman james ruvolo said he wouldnt 
count lukens out he also said i assume hes given bob 
bennett heartburn 
lukens is facing three republican challengers former us rep 
thomas kindness state rep john boehner and bond underwriter mort 
meier three candidates are running in the democratic primary 
reaction to lukens reelection bid was mixed 
rita hardman of fletcher said she will vote for lukens i 
think he has a lot of undercover supporters that dont have the 
nerve to say im going to vote for him but will she said 
dan cook a republian said lukens legal situation disqualifies 
him in his mind i think hes embarrassing to the party i think 
hes embarrassing to the whole government he said hes not 
the good example that you would expect 
lukens had said since his conviction that he wouldnt decide on 
his political future until after the outcome of his appeal he 
filed for reelection but hadnt openly campaigned 
appearing with his mother he made his announcement wednesday 
before about 20 supporters outside the post office in this farming 
village of 515 
i apologize for the situation i allowed to be created 
lukens said i made a bad mistake but the mistake was not evil 
and not criminal im saying im not guilty of the charge 
boehner said he doesnt believe lukens will be a factor in the 
race and he called the congressmans announcement a lastditch 
effort to save his job 
i guess it surprises me that after all this time he would 
conveniently come to the conclusion that he ought to apologize six 
days before the election boehner said 
donald birgel chairman of the butler county republican party 
said lukens could win his supporters will be there at the 
polls birgel said theyre not going to stay home 
lukens served in congress from 1967 to 1970 when he made an 
unsuccessful attempt to gain the gop gubernatorial nomination 
after 15 years in the ohio senate he returned to congress in 1986

a bible belt prosecutor has pulled the 
plug on a national xrated tv channel that beamed movies like 
rambohhh sex platoon and hardcore girlfriends to 
satellite dish owners 
civil libertarians are alarmed by the ease with which district 
attorney jimmy evans a democratic candidate for state attorney 
general drove new yorkbased home dish satellite networks inc out 
of business 
whats happened is some little small town in the south is 
setting the standard for the rest of the country said martin 
mccaffery vice president of the civil liberties union of alabama 
its a horrendous precedent 
evans says adult films have no first amendment protection 
these movies not only violate alabamas obscenity law they 
violate every state obscenity law and the federal obscenity law 
he said this is a national scandal 
he said he began an investigation after parents complained that 
their young children were obtaining videotapes of pornographic 
movies broadcast on the american exxxtasy channel which was 
operated by home dish 
i know from experience that hardcore obscenity leads to the 
abuse of women and children the montgomery county prosecutor 
said its bad for our community and bad for our children 
the american exxxtasy channel transmitted hardcore movies to 
home satellite subscribers but it also operated the tuxxedo 
channel a cable channel featuring rrated softcore porn 
in february a grand jury in montgomery returned more than 500 
indictments against home dish three other outofstate companies 
and 10 people on charges of distributing hardcore pornography via 
satellite into alabama 
the other indicted companies general telephone and electronics 
corp gte spacenet corp and us satellite inc provided the 
satellite capability for american exxxtasy but they pleaded 
ignorance and cut off home dish service 
the tuxxedo channel soon met the same fate its broadcasts to 
local cable affiliates and dish owners were removed from a 
satellite owned by general motors corp after a grand jury returned 
another indictment against home dish 
home dish which had reached 12 million cable customers and 
80000 satelliteequipped homes had to lay off its 100 employees 
its president paul klein and three other company officials still 
face an alabama extradition request 
i cant fight it said klein a former nbc executive im 
small and very vulnerable im out of business and theyre still 
trying to extradite me new york gov mario cuomo has the 
extradition request under review his office said 
without proving that anything is obscene jimmy evans has 
succeeded in bankrupting this company and keeping the rest of the 
country from seeing these movies in the privacy of their home 
mccaffery said 
klein said his channels which had 30 satellite customers in 
montgomery and about 600 around the state were meant for 
consenting adults but perhaps thousands of others were stealing 
the service with illegal descramblers 
klein said many tuxxedo affiliates switched their subscribers to 
one of two other softcore cable channels rendezvous and playboy 
evans said he knows nothing of those channels which montgomerys 
only cable company doesnt offer 
evans montgomerys chief prosecutor since 1973 went after 
adult magazines in 1986 while in his first unsuccessful bid to 
become attorney general 
playboy and penthouse magazines fought back filing a lawsuit 
that accused evans of arbitrarily listing about 50 adult magazines 
as obscene and then pressuring montgomeryarea merchants not to 
sell them 
a federal judge sided with the publishers in a sharply worded 
order that barred evans from bringing criminal charges against 
merchants for past sales of sexually explicit magazines 
despite the order convenience stores and other merchants 
continued to refrain from selling hardcore sex magazines 
last year evans attacked adult videotapes thirteen businesses 
were charged with selling and renting allegedly obscene tapes 
about 130 indictments were returned against the businesses their 
managers and other store employees 
the cases never went to trial the stores agreed to pay fines 
and remove the offending tapes from their shelves 
evans denies that hes mixing politics with porn but hell be 
the first to admit that hes ready to expand his smutbusting 
campaign from the confines of montgomery a city of 180000 
when i get in the attorney generals office theres not going 
to be a single hamlet or village or city in this state thats going 
to have that kind of stuff for sale he said

after years as the butt of western jokes east bloc 
fashion hit the paris runways with a display of such 
glasnostinspired styles as seethrough culottes minuscule minis 
and a velourcovered submachine gun 
four designers from the soviet union poland hungary and east 
germany paraded their creations before a small group of invited 
guests at the prince de galles marriott hotel on wednesday 
it was a preview of a big fashion showcocktail party for 700 
guests to be held tonight at the salle wagram a dance 
hallturnedauditorium a prize will be awarded by the lalique 
crystal company to the most talented designer 
whoever wins will be happy but all four designers were pleased 
to be showing in paris widely viewed as the wests fashion capital 
soviet designer lena zelinskaia 25 startled the audience with 
shiny velour culotte suits in fireengine red turquoise blue and 
grass green accompanied by matching velourwrapped submachine 
guns 
she denied the guns were a ploy to attract photographers 
the machinegun accessory symbolizes the russian revolution 
which is still very much in our minds zelinskaia said taking a 
bow with the other designers after the show 
her clothes were a far cry from the western image of soviet 
fashion perhaps most mercilessly parodied in a tv commercial for 
wendys in which a matronly model in a drab dress for daywear 
merely adds a flashlight for evening and a beach ball for swimwear 
as for the future of soviet design she said it wont be 
french were a different country with different religion and 
politics but we have many tendencies and i cant speak for the 
others only myself 
im an old designer in the business for 30 years said 
polish creator jerzy antkowiak 50 who displayed the most variety 
in his preview his clothes ranged from a flowing gray crepe de 
chine printed duster over a wide long pantskirt to a deep red 
taffeta minidress with several daring cutouts on the back and a 
transparent navy longculottes outfit 
weve got many problems in poland said antkowiak dressed 
in a loose charcoal linen suit and ochre scarf for instance we 
have to import all our fabrics but we have hopes that well get 
investments from the west to set up better manufacturing and 
business 
the show was organized by the ecole superieure de commerce de 
compiegne a french business school north of paris last year the 
school featured top soviet designer slava zaitsev 
this years choice of designers evolved from embassy suggestions 
and from connections that one of the organizers boris bostjancic 
has with moscow contact a new firm that seeks to set up eastwest 
commercial agreements 
east german designer anja wenzel showed attractive long looks 
featuring some folkloreinspired fabric mixes and a black chiffon 
halternecked jumpsuit with a metal snake slithering up back and 
front 
hungarian designer katelin berenyi 24 has lived in paris for 
the past two years studying at the national decorative arts school 
one of her outfits reminiscent of pierre cardin included a 
velvet micromini over thighhigh socks and coneshaped pleated 
gauntlets of white paper on the models arms 
i love crazy fashions said antkowiak who admits that his 
clothes look wayout and are expensive for poland about 50 a 
dress he said they are usually purchased by privileged richer 
women diplomats and tourists 
so far i have to keep prices high he said because if i 
offer cheaper models my old clientele asks why and doesnt want 
to buy them they want to be special

police swarmed into a gritty park and clashed 
with squatters holding a may day festival tuesday night after 
people began throwing bottles to protest an abrupt end to a park 
concert police said 
the clash at tompkins square park in the east village left 12 
officers injured and several protesters were arrested police said 
dozens of homeless people live in the park tensions have flared 
the past two summers when police moved to oust the squatters 
concertgoers began throwing bottles when police turned out the 
lights to the bandshell at 9 pm because the band had a permit to 
play only until then said police capt charles hanley 
there were about 300 people there hanley said they got 
angry started throwing bottles it was basically a riot 
the injured officers suffered assorted head and hand injuries 
said hanley and lt dave fenton police apparently made their first 
charge after a parks department officer was hit in the face with a 
bottle 
rob nunzio 27 lead guitarist in the band antidote was on 
stage when the lights went out said when they shut the music 
off people started protesting the cops came in from avenue a it 
looked like hundreds of them people started screaming at the 
copsthe cops grabbed whoever was in their way and threw them 
down 
one cop got hit by a bottle while on stage and got very mad 
and started trashing our equipment said another musician jason 
goodrow 
later about 50 police officers wearing helmets and carrying 
shields and nightsticks remained in the park dozens of people were 
walking around the neighborhood knocking over garbage cans and 
setting trash on fire 
others sat down in the street by the park chanting at police 
officers the cops started the riot 
about half hour later at 11 pm a skirmish broke out when 
about four officers on scooters apparently tried to break through a 
line of 50 protesters the protesters retaliated by knocking the 
officers off their scooters prompting about two dozens officers to 
rush in pushing aside the protesters and dragging one of them off 
the squatter may day festival featuring live music 
contests and food began saturday and was scheduled to end tuesday 
at the east village park

the post office is proposing a 
revolutionary idea that the 150 million people of latin americas 
largest country pay their bills by mail instead of standing in line 
brazil is modern in many ways but you still cannot write a 
check for your electricity bill put it in a stamped envelope and 
drop it in a mailbox 
virtually all bills are paid at banks which are clogged with 
long lines of grumbling sweaty people holding stacks of 
electricity gas and water bills school department store health 
insurance and credit card accounts auto license fees and 
statements of income or property taxes 
a specialized commercial culture has sprouted around the 
practice companies and wealthy individuals hire young men 
universally called office boys to do their standing and paying 
one companys office boy presented a check to pay the telephone 
bill but the bank insisted on cash he went to the companys own 
bank which said it would take a check but must have a new one 
naming the bank as payee in desperation the office boy returned 
to the first bank where the manager finally made an exception and 
accepted the check 
the post office wants to make things simpler 
its press spokesman jose valfranio medeiros de oliveira said 
in an interview theres nothing easier than paying bills by 
mail and we want to make life easier for our citizens 
some newspapers have begun rather timidly to support the 
program 
yes there is a long tradition here of not paying by mail 
oliveira said but we have the infrastructure we have 
credibility theres no reason this wont work 
this month he said the post office will run a test program 
allowing people in the northeastern state of bahia population 116 
million to pay telephone bills by mail if that goes well the 
experiment will be extended to other states and to bills for water 
gas and federal taxes 
all brazils 4000plus townships have post offices whereas 
onethird dont have banks oliveira said 
in addition there are 22000 public mailboxes and 3000 rural 
collection points on farms and ranches post offices have longer 
hours than banks some post offices are open on weekends 
brazils largest commercial bank the governmentcontrolled 
banco do brasil announced plans for a citizens comfort a 
program that would allow even people without accounts at the bank 
to mail it their checks for water electricity gas and federal tax 
bills 
alberto policaro the bank president said that would make life 
easier for brazilians and free bank workers from receiving bills 
and let them get on with the banks real business taking in 
deposits and making loans 
public acceptance of such a departure is far from universal 
luis santanna mendes a rio teletype operator who used to work 
for the post office telegraph service said id rather wait in 
line at a bank that way you have confirmation that you paid 
at a bank you get a stub with a machine stamp showing the 
amount paid 
oliveira said post offices could provide the same kind of 
receipt that means bill payers would have to line up at the post 
office of course but the press spokesman said our lines move 
faster than bank lines 
surveys by brazils largest private polling company known as 
ibope indicate the post office is brazils most trusted public 
institution but skepticism persists 
you just dont know if the letter really will get there 
mendes said 
another problem is that brazilian banks do not return canceled 
checks they keep check records on microfilm in the case of a 
disputed payment the payer would have to line up at the bank to 
see his account record 
there are technical details to be worked out oliveira 
acknowledged but if you can pay bills by mail in the united 
states and europe theres no reason you cant do it in brazil 
too

looks arent everything if they were zoo 
curators across the country wouldnt be scrambling to get their own 
colonies of naked mole rats 
the fanged 4inch african mammals are desired for their 
subterranean social habits not their pink wrinkled looks 
theyre not the most attractive mammal ive ever seen said 
james doherty general curator at new yorks bronx zoo which plans 
to open an exhibit next winter 
since march 1989 the cincinnati zoo has had the nations only 
display of the hairless mole rats but the brookfield zoo near 
chicago plans to open its exhibit may 18 zoos in philadelphia and 
london have mole rats that are not on display while zoos in phoenix 
and washington dc are seeking colonies 
it continues to be a popular attraction because they catch 
your eye for one reason or another said randy morgan an 
entomologist who oversees the cincinnati zoos 40rat exhibit i 
dont think of them as ugly i think they come across as bizarre 
animated and comical 
zoo curators and scientists say mole rats beauty and 
significance are in their lifestyles virtually blind they live 
underground and burrow in a constant search for food tubers and 
roots they find by stumbling upon them 
however they are distinguished by their social system morgan 
said tuesday 
they live in colonies of about three dozen only one female in 
each colony breeds using her sharp teeth to fend off challengers 
and secreting a scent that inhibits other females from developing 
into queens 
only one or two males mate with the queen and researchers are 
uncertain how they are selected morgan said all other ablebodied 
mole rats search for food for themselves and the queen 
in exhibits they scamper backward as easily as forward yanking 
other mole rats out of the way by their tails and digging through 
wood and cork shavings within their home 
they sleep in huddles piling on top of each other for warmth 
but a pile of naked mole rats is seldom still if one twitches in 
its sleep the entire huddle shudders morgan said 
documented more than a century ago naked mole rats are found 
only under the desert of kenya in eastern africa zoos pay about 
200 an animal said bruce brewer curator of mammals at the 
brookfield zoo 
zoo curators credit south african researcher jennifer jarvis 
with bringing mole rats to light which piqued zoos interest 
the problem with zoo displays was the mole rats extreme 
sensitivity to sound and vibration doherty said the rats are 
easily panicked by the slightest sound or vibration and their huge 
incisors can rapidly scratch plexiglass into a frosted opaque 
shield 
we kind of whisper around them doherty said 
zoos have developed ways to shockproof their mole rat habitats 
some building mazes of glass tubes on tables embedded in sand and 
others erecting double glass walls that trap air as insulation 
reaction from zoo patrons varies when they first see naked mole 
rats morgan said 
it varies from oh yuck to oh my god morgan said they 
see mole or rat on the display and think these are the things in 
my front yard 
but for people who take time to read about them they are 
amazed he said on busy days people are lined up three to 
four deep

oriental food is king in this queen city 
of the ozarks where even the burger joints serve the dish that all 
springfield craves cashew chicken 
ozark cuisine may conjure up images of panfried trout and 
catfish fried chicken mashed potatoes and gravy but just as 
surely as bostonians bake beans and chicagoans take pride in pizza 
springfields culinary claim to fame is cashew chicken 
more than 50 of springfields 375 licensed restaurants feature 
chinese food another dozen or so korean polynesian japanese and 
vietnamese restaurants contribute to a gastronomic smorgasbord for 
asian food lovers 
im a chinese food nut with a chinese restaurant on every 
corner im in heaven says gary wilson an attorney and regular 
at the allyoucaneat noon and evening buffets offered by many of 
the restaurants 
but not just any chinese food chinese restaurants here are 
judged not for their moo goo gai pan or egg rolls but for their 
cashew chicken and not just chinese restaurants even cafeterias 
and burger shops serve up the dish 
springfields unofficial nickname says it all cashew chicken 
capital of the midwest 
one newspaper columnist took calculator in hand and figured that 
springfield restaurants serve a minimum of 6697 to 8554 orders of 
cashew chicken a day that averages out to 24 million to 31 
million orders a year 
springfields variation on the dish isnt the standard cashew 
chicken dish found around the country where stirfried chicken and 
vegetables are mixed with cashews 
chefs here dip the chicken in batter deepfat fry it smother 
it with a thick brown sauce made from chicken stock and soy sauce 
add cashews and a few bits of green onion and serve the concoction 
beside a bed of fried rice 
one aficionado fondly describes the meal as kind of like 
chicken mcnuggets with gravy 
so peculiar is the cashew chicken recipe to springfield that 
chinese restaurants in cities like dallas chicago kansas city and 
st louis that try to imitate it identify the dish on menus as 
springfield cashew chicken 
but the cashew chicken served outside of springfield a regional 
trade and health center in southwestern missouri usually falls 
short of the dish current and former residents crave 
ive never tasted the cashew chicken i loved in springfield 
anywhere else says timolyn skeeters a flight attendant based in 
charlotte nc and a graduate of southwest missouri state 
university in springfield i miss it out here cashew chicken is 
just regular chicken and a few cashews i think the secret must be 
in the sauce 
the roots of springfields love affair with cashew chicken can 
be traced to 1963 
that was when david leong and his wife shau left florida to 
found leongs tea house springfields first chinese restaurant at 
first ozarkers were skeptical of chinese food 
my father noticed that people here liked fried chicken said 
ling leong president of his familys restaurant and chinese 
specialty foods company so he cut it into bitesize pieces and 
served it with a special sauce and cashews and rice 
springfield cashew chicken was born and quickly became a hit 
among the meatandpotatoes crowd 
soon more chinese then vietnamese began moving to springfield 
where minorities still account for barely 2 percent of the 
population they opened restaurants and virtually every one 
featured cashew chicken 
i think one reason cashew chicken became popular is because 
this is chicken country said woodrow sun who with his wife 
aurora owns four chinese restaurants people like to eat 
chicken eighty percent of my restaurants sales are chicken 
dishes 
the low price of cashew chicken ranging from about 250 for a 
carryout order to around 7 in fullservice restaurants appeals 
to families and the 25000 students attending four colleges in the 
city 
leong said hed heard two more chinese restaurants would open 
this year 
if they asked me my advice would be dont do it sun said 
with a wry smile thats all this town needs is another chinese 
restaurant

day and night heavy artillery and tank 
barrages thunder along a 90mile front in what might be the 
decisive battle of the nearly 30yearold eritrean civil war 
africas longestrunning conflict 
the battle raging between ethiopian government troops and 
eritrean rebels in ethiopias northernmost province is possibly the 
most destructive conflict in the world today resulting in 
thousands of casualties on both sides 
the rebels appear to have the upper hand in the fighting along 
what is called the ghinda front so fierce are the artillery and 
tank exchanges that their distant rumble can be heard clearly in 
the strategic red sea port of massawa about 37 miles away 
massawa now in rebel hands was the target of six ethiopian air 
raids in april by sovietbuilt mig fighters rebel spokesmen say at 
least 110 people many of them civilians have been killed in the 
cluster bomb attacks 
the antagonists in the fight are the marxist government of 
president mengistu haile mariam and rebel forces dominated by the 
eritrean peoples liberation front which seek independence for the 
province of 35 million people the eritrean front is considered 
leftleaning but its leaders say they reject any political 
identification tag 
the government forces immediate objective is to recapture 
massawa one of only two ethiopian red sea harbors that have 
traditionally handled most of the countrys trade and international 
relief supplies for millions of famine victims 
the port was captured by the eritreans on feb 11 three days 
after they launched a major new offensive in their 29yearold war 
of secession 
the rebels have their sights set on a bigger objective the 
capture of their ancient hallowed provincial capital of asmara and 
the end to a conflict that has claimed hundreds of thousands of 
lives 
the ghinda front straddles the only road from asmara to massawa 
a twolane ribbon of asphalt stretching 62 miles 
the addis ababa government has issued few war communiques but 
in a rare pronouncement acknowledged last friday that the battle 
had reached a decisive final stage 
the last previous government statement on the conflict came in 
midfebruary shortly after the fall of massawa to the rebels 
at that time mengistu told parliament that failure to recapture 
massawa would mean the loss of his 2nd revolutionary army asmara 
and eritrea itself 
that now seems likely 
mengistus 2nd army more than 100000 strong representing 
almost a third of ethiopias military strength is virtually 
surrounded in the highlands around asmara its only remaining 
supply route is a tenuous air link from governmentheld territory 
far to the south and east 
another major rebel force the tigre peoples liberation front 
has tied up mengistus remaining armies in an offensive that has 
taken the tigreans to within 100 miles of the capital of addis 
ababa the tigreans are seeking mengistus ouster 
the ethiopian government claims and the eritrean rebels freely 
acknowledge that the two offensives by the separate rebel forces 
have been coordinated the tigrean rebels began their offensive 
last august sweeping south and east out of their stronghold of 
tigre province just south of eritrea 
isayas afeworki the general secretary of the eritrean rebel 
movement says his strategy is to bleed mengistus 2nd army dry on 
the ghinda front then retake the offensive 
there is no hope for the dergue government to take back 
massawa afeworki said i think what they are doing is 
motivated by desperation 
a new offensive aimed at asmara from the south already is 
under way but it is unclear if it is being pursued by the 
eritreans or the tigreans 
ethiopia claims a tigrean force has pushed northward 
overrunning three government garrisons south of asmara and behind 
the ghinda front the eritreans claim the new move as their own 
on the ghinda front afeworki said the ethiopian army had made 
three major attempts to retake massawa in the past month but 
described it as a futile suicidal effort 
afeworki and other rebel leaders said the 2nd armys only access 
to the lowland plains leading to the red sea is through a few 
narrow mountain roads that are easy to choke 
they have to get through our artillery tank and mortar fire 
then our minefields then our fighters pop up out of their bunkers 
and chew up those that remain afeworki said 
the rebels claim they have inflicted some 13000 casualties on 
government forces in nearly a month of fighting along the ghinda 
front including 6000 killed they dont talk in specific numbers 
about their own losses but afeworki said they were less than a 
tenth of the governments 
ethiopias armed forces are the largest in black africa 
numbering 315800 the international institute for strategic 
studies based in london estimates the eritrean rebel force at 
30000 and the tigreans at 20000 
the government and the rebels have made exaggerated battlefield 
claims which cannot be independently verified but there is no 
doubt about the ferocity of the fighting 
in recent testimony to a senate committee in washington the 
assistant secretary of state for african affairs herman j cohen 
described the conflict as possibly the largest in terms of 
combatants and the most destructive in the world today 
the intensified fighting follows two unsuccessful rounds of 
peace talks held late last year between government and rebel 
emissaries under the mediation of former president jimmy carter in 
nairobi kenya and atlanta

president mikhail s gorbachev drummed his fingers 
as protesters in red square shouted resign but he showed no 
anger over a demonstration that he himself authorized 
food is not a luxury read one sign protesting the failure 
of gorbachevs reforms to deliver economic benefits 
a dictator is a president without an election said another 
slogan referring to gorbachevs appointment as president in march 
by a legislature that also granted him sweeping powers beyond those 
he enjoys as general secretary of the communist party 
in a nation where pollsters have not published comprehensive 
opinion surveys on the leaders popularity the may day outburst 
was the clearest sign yet of rising public anger over a slowdown in 
reforms under gorbachev 
such an outburst may have been just what gorbachev had in mind 
when he signed a presidential order last month moving control over 
demonstrations in moscow from the city government to the national 
council of ministers the council made up of gorbachevs 
supporters approved tuesdays unofficial demonstration 
they werent surprised they knew exactly what to expect 
said leonid zhuralev one of the tens of thousands of protesters 
who filed through red square 
gorbachev might use the protest to persuade reluctant 
hardliners to agree to radical economic reforms that he has 
promised recently 
he has used the tactic before on feb 4 a crowd officially 
estimated at 200000 gathered outside the kremlin demanding a 
multiparty system 
three days later conservatives on the communist party central 
committee bowed to gorbachevs suggestion that the constitution be 
amended to deprive the party of its monopoly on power 
in the five years since he became party general secretary 
gorbachev has managed to turn nearly every defeat into a victory 
staying a step or two ahead of his opponents on the right and left 
he could be in for the harshest test yet of his political 
agility in the coming weeks 
the parliament of the russian federation the largest of the 15 
soviet republics convenes for the first time on may 16 and it 
could elect gorbachevs populist rival boris yeltsin as president 
of the republic 
the party is in turmoil it opens a congress on july 2 and is 
widely expected to split into at least three factions left and 
right with gorbachev supporters in the middle 
after elections in march radical reformers took over the moscow 
and leningrad city governments 
radicals like many of the may day protesters want to move more 
quickly to a market economy 
conservatives such as party apparatchiks and many military 
officers oppose market reforms and fear the uncertainties of 
political change 
many wise men of economics are calling us to plunge headlong 
into a market economy trusting our luck said yevgeny kuznetsov 
a union leader who addressed the may day crowd before the 
protesters filed through red square 
but we wont be able to trust our luck if we dont beforehand 
take into account the consequences growth in prices a fall in the 
standard of living and unemployment kuznetsov said 
the conservatives are also angry that gorbachev allowed the 
collapse of the soviet empire in eastern europe and the 
declaration of independence by lithuania the may day protesters 
by contrast shouted freedom for lithuania 
the domestic furor has deflected soviet attention from an aspect 
of gorbachevs policies that has made him popular in the west the 
pursuit of arms control and the reduction of world tension 
and that means gorbachev may not get much of a boost at home 
from his planned summit meeting with president bush at the end of 
what has already started as a very harried month of may

gov bill clements called the legislature 
into session today for a third try at school finance reform after a 
judge gave the state another month to devise a plan to send more 
money to poor schools 
if the legislature and clements cannot agree on a plan this 
time one will be written for them state district judge scott 
mccown said tuesday 
the present scheme of public school finance is a great wrong 
the poor have waited for too long mccown said as he extended 
the texas supreme courts tuesday deadline for overhauling school 
financing to june 1 
the reprieve allowed a 500 million state aid payment to be made 
in may and ensured schools will stay open through this school year 
mccown warned there will be no further deadline extensions the 
texas supreme court ruled 90 last year in favor of propertypoor 
school districts that challenged the current 135 billionayear 
system as unfair 
school spending in texas as in many states is based mostly on 
property taxes 
state education commissioner william kirby said he feared a 
third legislative failure would lead to a courtwritten plan he 
said that the court can only shift money around not raise taxes 
and that any courtordered solution would be a robin hood one 
taking from the rich giving to the poor 
other school officials praised the ruling 
if it needs to be corrected judiciously so be it said 
charles hohertz superintendent of the shallowater independent 
school district one of 54 school systems that took part in the 
suit 
the second attempt to overhaul school financing failed over a 
proposed tax increase tuesday 
the democraticcontrolled legislature had approved a 555 
million reform plan to pay for it legislators proposed cutting 
114 million from the budget and raising the state sales tax from 6 
cents to 6 cents on the dollar 
but clements a republican vetoed the tax increase he said the 
money should be taken from other programs 
in case clements and lawmakers fail again the judge tuesday 
said he would appoint a special master to get started on a finance 
plan of his own 
at edgewood high school in san antonio where many classrooms 
are not airconditioned and lockers and bathrooms are in disrepair 
educators and students said they were not optimistic about 
lawmakers solving the problem by june 1 
but pat ramirez an english teacher said she knew how to make 
lawmakers deal with the issue 
just come and sit in a classroom with four fans blowing hot 
air if youre lucky enough to be in a room that has four fans like 
mine and you would come up with something very quickly she said 
texas is one of a dozen states where courts have overturned 
school finance systems deemed unfair to poor districts 
the others are kentucky new jersey kansas wisconsin 
california connecticut washington west virginia wyoming 
arkansas and montana

the pentagon touting the contribution its new 
radar could make in the drug war is seeking money for the 
hightech system that congress wouldnt buy for its military value 
the 2428 million radar which would scan deep into mexico to 
find drugsmuggling aircraft has resurfaced as the costliest item 
in the defense departments 1991 counterdrug budget 
congressional investigators question whether moving the system 
to the popular and growing antidrug budget is a maneuver to save 
it 
i categorically deny it said michael a wermuth deputy 
assistant secretary of defense for drug enforcement policy 
the defense department tried to sell a southernfacing sector of 
over the horizon backscatter radar to congress in fiscal years 
1989 and 1990 citing a potential bomber threat from latin america 
but lawmakers such as rep nicholas mavroules dmass chairman 
of the house armed services investigations subcommittee were 
unconvinced and declined to approve the project 
mavroules said there was absolutely not in my judgment a 
bomber threat from latin america the lawmaker said he wants to 
investigate the budget shuffle but is willing to let the pentagon 
prove the radar is an effective tool in drug interdiction 
the first backscatter system became operational april 24 in 
bangor maine to protect the atlantic coast wermuth said test 
results showed it could detect the slowmoving lowflying drug 
planes that plod toward the us southwest border 
other backscatter sites are under construction in the west 
and congress also has agreed to construction of the radar in alaska 
this is not a system that has been purchased exclusively for 
counternarcotics said the pentagons wermuth arguing there 
still is a longterm bomber threat from the south even if theres 
no current threat from latin america 
he said the southernlooking sector of backscatter was moved 
to the drug budget in recognition of the contribution that part 
of the system will make in the counternarcotics effort 
the centralsouthwest sector of backscatter comprises 
onefifth of the pentagons 12 billion antidrug budget for the 
coming fiscal year this year the military is expected to spend 
887 million to combat illegal drugs wermuth said 
a house armed services committee staff member familiar with the 
decision not to fund the southernbeamed radar said skepticism 
about a bomber threat from latin america was the dominant reason 
the project was not approved 
the staffer who spoke on condition of anonymity said it is a 
common ploy of the pentagon to transfer controversial programs into 
the sacred cow of the day right now its drugs 
it raises the question of whether its just a shuffle to get a 
system that may not be justified to meet a military threat said 
louis rodrigues who is directing a general accounting office 
investigation into the radar systems costeffectiveness 
the investigation was requested by the senate armed services 
committee 
if backscatter works as planned it would be able to spot 
even the smallest smuggler aircraft somewhere over mexico long 
before it reached the border 
the hightech system bounces powerful radio beams off the 
ionosphere unlike conventional radars whose beams are limited to 
line of sight return signals reach massive antennas and generate 
computer radar pictures of targets between 500 and 2000 miles 
distant 
pentagon officials say the systems computers then would be able 
to feed tactical information on drug targets to law enforcement 
intelligence centers 
the centralsouthwest sector would be located in north dakota 
south dakota and minnesota

in a village in kosovo province 
tens of thousands of ethnic albanians gathered to formally renounce 
the practice of seeking blood vengeance against rival families 
tanjug reported 
the previously unannounced gathering tuesday proceeded without 
major incidents or police intervention the state news agency said 
kosovo repeatedly has seen clashes between the southern 
provinces ethnic albanian majority which seeks greater autonomy 
and massive security forces sent in to protect the slav minority 
from alleged albanian harassment 
tanjug said the ethnic albanians waved flags without the 
communist symbol of a fivepointed star and shouted at any member 
of kosovos serb minority passing by 
the gathering in the village of gornja luka close to 
neighboring communist albania was the second such meeting in the 
past month in kosovo 
the tradition of blood vengeance dates from the middle ages 
and binds the head of an ethnic albanian family to claim blood if a 
family member is attacked by any member of a rival family 
reconciliation is usually completed with the head of the family 
claiming blood vowing not to seek fresh blood women are exempt 
from blood vengeance and traditionally have taken over the field 
work of any male relatives who feared their lives were in danger 
and thus stayed inside family quarters 
tanjug estimated tuesdays crowd at 100000 other sources who 
asked not to be identified estimated the number at tens of 
thousands 
tanjug said thousands of car tractors trucks buses and cattle 
drawn carts clogged the roads around gornja luka from early morning 
until early afternoon 
staterun television and radio made no mention of the ceremony 
and it was not clear how many ethnic albanian families buried their 
feuds at the gathering

suspicious fires destroyed or damaged 32 cars at a 
parking lot near the new tokyo international airport before dawn 
today and police blamed radical leftists opposed to the airports 
expansion 
incendiary devices were found under the burned vehicles at a 
private lot about 3 miles north of the airport said a local police 
officer no injuries were reported 
judging from the circumstances we suspect the fire was caused 
by radical extremists said the officer who requested anonymity 
the airport in narita is 40 miles northeast of tokyo and many 
of the 68 cars at the lot were owned by travelers using the airport 
the government plans to build a terminal and two new runways by 
the end of march 1991 to ease overcrowding and meet demands for 
more flights 
radicals have resisted plans to expropriate farmland to expand 
the airport which opened in 1978 eight farmers living on the 
expansion site refuse to leave

vice president dan quayle who came to the job 
with his resume blank on foreign affairs is learning international 
diplomacy on the fly literally 
quayle is outpacing president bush in foreign travel and that 
says a lot since bush who has been to 17 countries since taking 
office has traveled more than any previous us president at a 
comparable time in his term 
with bush preoccupied with the upcoming soviet and sevennation 
economic summits and with events in eastern europe and on the 
hostage front quayle has been landing one foreign assignment after 
the other 
just back from nicaragua and mexico quayle will be in the air 
again next week with stops in rome london and paris for 
festivities honoring the late president eisenhower italy britain 
and france are countries nos 2325 on quayles vice presidential 
passport 
thats a lot of globetrotting for a former indiana senator who 
aides say doesnt like to travel 
quayle has just completed a major mission a series of goodwill 
trips to mend fences with latin american leaders uneasy over last 
decembers us invasion of panama 
in the process he visited 14 latin american countries and began 
establishing his credentials as a specialist on the region at a 
time of dramatic change 
quayles performance as a goodwill ambassador in latin america 
has won praise from senior white house officials and from many 
lawmakers including sen edward m kennedy dmass who 
accompanied quayle on one of the trips 
thats not to say that quayles visits have all been studies in 
smooth execution and good timing 
for instance 
in managua for the inauguration of president violeta chamorro 
quayle found himself shorthanded when trucks bearing 1000 tons of 
us flour and vegetable oil didnt make it from honduras in time 
for a kickoff fooddistribution ceremony he had to make do with 
the few bags of flour and cans of oil his delegation brought that 
morning from washington 
in paraguay quayle joyfully accepted on behalf of the national 
zoo a gift of two prized jaguars only to discover they were on the 
us endangered species list the cats stayed in paraguay 
his goodwill tour ended on a frosty note last week with a 
tonguelashing in mexico from president carlos salinas who 
registered anger at the abduction to the united states of a mexican 
doctor accused in the 1985 slaying of a us drug enforcement agent 
then there was the matter of the doll quayle purchase over 
wife marilyns protests of an xrated wooden doll in valparaiso 
chile was widely reported making quayle the brunt of many 
washington jokes 
the problem with quayle and the image business is every time 
he makes a miscue you know its going to be grist for latenight 
tv comedians said stephen hess a specialist on the presidency 
with the brookings institution 
still hess said quayles performance has helped counter his 
image as young and immature 
as he travels and is perceived as someone with international 
experience it has to rebound to his benefit hess said he can 
now talk with some confidence about other parts of the world about 
world leaders 
quayle seems less confident when he deals with some areas of the 
world 
for instance in a recent speech he urged israel to commit 
itself to the arrow antimissile missile being developed by us 
and israeli scientists 
but when asked by members of the audience to elaborate quayle 
simply repeated the words of his speech he denied that the level 
of us funding was an obstacle to the project even though 
officials on both sides say funding is one of the main problems 
and his office had to scramble on march 26 when a soviet 
official quoted quayle to support the kremlins crackdown on 
lithuanian army deserters quayle had said a certain element of 
discipline was needed in any armed force quayle aides insisted 
the soviets took the remarks out of context 
quayle still has a way to go to close in on bushs frequent 
flier record as vice president 76 countries but bush took eight 
years to accumulate that and quayles only been in office a little 
more than 15 months 
in addition to his foreign travel quayle has been to 40 states 
as vice president he will be on the road 19 days this month alone 
does dan quayle enjoy all the travel he doesnt said 
spokesman david beckwith he likes to be home with his family

exxon workers hitting alaskas beaches 
for a second summer of cleanup got approval from gov steve cowper 
to use potentially toxic fertilizer to remove oil everythings 
dead anyway he said 
about 100 exxon workers in five teams tuesday were sent to pick 
up oily debris on the shoreline in prince william sound three more 
squads of 20 to 50 each will go out later this week said exxon 
spokesman jim robertson 
the cleanup from exxons march 1989 spill of nearly 11 million 
gallons of north slope crude was suspended in september the 
nations biggest oil spill killed hundreds of otters and thousands 
of birds and other animals more than 200 miles of shoreline still 
have some oil according to an exxon survey 
state officials decided tuesday to permit extensive use of 
fertilizers along the prince william sound shoreline the urea and 
phosphorousbased fertilizer speeds the growth of bacteria known to 
eat oil 
we know direct application of these chemicals will have a 
toxic effect cowper said but the flip side is these beaches 
have been heavily oiled and everythings dead anyway 
alaskas department of environmental conservation had balked at 
the process known as bioremediation environmentalists fishing 
groups and recreational users of the sound had expressed concern 
that incorrect application of the fertilizer could produce unwanted 
slime 
exxon has said it wants to use bioremediation on 160 of the 209 
sites it had surveyed by last week 
the state dropped its hesitation over the technique after 
reviewing environmental protection agency data on toxicity and the 
effectiveness of inipol a frenchmade fertilizer developed 
especially for oily shores 
fertilizers will be used carefully to avoid exposure to mammals 
and will be monitored daily and reviewed in six weeks for 
effectiveness officials said 
oily tar balls will be removed bhy hand on environmentally 
sensitive shores said coast guard rear adm david ciancaglini the 
governments onscene coordinator for the cleanup 
priority will be given areas considered important for recreation 
and commercial fishing officials said 
cowper said relations between the state and exxon corp have 
improved significantly this year 
last summer we often had to rely on confrontational press in 
order to generate any kind of action the governor said i 
think a lot of the rough spots have been cleared away

resorts on opposite sides of the 
continent are battling to build the worlds longest sand sculpture 
in a down and dirty fight 
we shall fight them on the airwaves we shall fight them in 
the newspapers most importantly we shall fight them on the 
beaches proclaimed a group of civic leaders in the tiny resort 
community of long beach wash 
a similar coalition of civic leaders in myrtle beach sc 
issued a declaration of war 
last june about 2000 people carved a worldrecord sand 
sculpture 15063 feet long at myrtle beach but the record fell in 
july when long beach sculpted a sea serpent of 16040 feet just 
over three miles long 
myrtle beach hopes to reclaim the record in a oneday attempt on 
june 1 while long beach a community of about 1300 yearround 
residents begins work on a new sculpture may 31 
even before the first sand is turned the contest has turned 
gritty 
both cities have tollfree hotlines to muster support for the 
battle and officials in myrtle beach which has a yearround 
population of 60000 hope 5000 will take part 
long beach expects about 1500 but that doesnt concern city 
manager nabiel shawa

wearing tank tops cutoff shorts and dirty clothes white socks 
are out thongs are out chest hair displayed beyond the second

hollywood fashion arbiter mr blackwell said in a telephone 
interview that he welcomed the change 
im a little tired of getting into a cab and they show up in 
an undershirt and theyve got armpits hanging out mr blackwell

the metropolitan operas last die walkure of 
the season was presented with new singers in the two leading 
soprano roles 
the operas two scheduled sopranos were felled one of them 
literally 
hildegarde behrens scheduled to sing brunnhilde was hit on the 
head by a falling piece of scenery near the end of 
gotterdammerung saturday night 
jessye norman scheduled to sing sieglinde was ill 
both were replaced tuesday night by their covers the singer 
standing by in case shes needed to perform 
gudrun volkert made her metropolitan opera debut as brunnhilde 
she has a beautiful middle range but her top notes arent produced 
easily miss volkert who was born in brno czechoslovakia has 
sung brunnhilde in seven european opera houses she is tall and 
very thin 
hanna lisowska of warsaw poland made her met debut on april 21 
as gutrune in gotterdammerung she proved more of a 
disappointment possibly partly because the audience expected not 
to hear hildegarde behrens but thought it was going to hear the 
lush vocal outpouring of jessye norman 
miss lisowska has a smaller voice and was singing with two 
bigvoiced men 
gary lakes was in good voice as siegmund sounding warm and 
heroic matti salminen as hunding made his bass notes round hollow 
and ominous 
miss lisowska sang a competent sieglinde but didnt make a 
listeners heart beat faster 
james morris was remarkable as wotan singing the long part with 
nuance and power never tiring 
christa ludwig sounded splendid as fricka as she left the 
stage maestro james levine blew her a kiss a program note said 
this performance celebrates the 30th anniversary of christa 
ludwigs metropolitan opera debut 
the ring cycle operas arent being presented at the met next 
season its possible that miss ludwig may not sing fricka at the 
met again 
levine made instrumental tempos and wotans act 2 monologue to 
brunnhilde unusually slow sometimes during the evening tempos 
were brisk 
miss behrens and her doctor have not decided whether shell be 
able to sing brunnhilde in thursdays siegfried or in

an ohio congressman is taking up the case of a 
german rocket scientist who worked for the united states after 
world war ii but was later accused of having brutalized prisoners 
in nazi slave labor camps 
rep james traficant is collecting files and information about 
arthur rudolph who surrendered his american citizenship and left 
the united states in 1984 under an agreement with the us 
government 
traficant believes pressure was put on arthur rudolph to 
renounce his citizenship h west richards a spokesman for the 
maverick democrat said tuesday he said the lawmaker will address 
supporters of rudolph next week in huntsville ala 
traficants interest in the case appears to stem from his 
campaign against the justice departments office of special 
investigations a unit that hunts suspected nazis 
he has sharply criticized the office for trying to discredit 
some witnesses in the case of john demjanjuk a retired 
clevelandarea auto worker on death row in israel after being 
convicted of committing nazi atrocities 
he believes they use questionable methods said richards 
but neal sher head of the osi said it is absurd for anyone 
to claim that rudolph was pressured or forced into renouncing his 
citizenship and leaving this country 
the case against rudolph was made in large measure by his own 
admissions the fact is rudolph simply did not want to be 
confronted with the damning evidence against him sher said 
rudolph who joined the nazi party in 1931 was production 
manager of a v2 rocket factory attached to the doranordhausen 
concentration camp he told osi investigators that he knew camp 
prisoners he picked to work in the underground factory died of 
maltreatment transcripts show 
rudolph was brought here along with more than 100 other german 
technicians and scientists after world war ii to help the united 
states develop space and armament programs he went to work for the 
national aeronautics and space administration becoming the manager 
of the saturn 5 rocket program that sent astronauts to the moon in 
1969 
now 84 he lives in hamburg west germany 
in the agreement he signed the osi said rudolph participated 
under the direction of and on behalf of the nazi government in 
germany in the persecution of unarmed civilians because of their 
race religion national origin or political opinion 
rudolph said in the agreement a copy of which was obtained by 
the associated press that he was familiar with the allegations and 
did not contest them he also acknowledged that my us 
citizenship was illegally procured and were i a nonus 
citizen i concede that i would be deportable 
the osi is looking into the files of other former participants 
in the rocket program to see if any of them lied about their past 
and could be stripped of their citizenship said one official 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
rudolphs supporters in alabama some of them former german 
colleagues maintain that he served the united states loyally and 
when he was no longer needed he was intimidated and harassed until 
he left the country 
mr traficant is the one man in congress who has opened his 
eyes to the methods used by the osi and called them into 
question said the invitation issued by friends of arthur rudolph 
to the may 12 event 
he is coming to huntsville because he wants to share his 
views with rudolphs friends and all who are concerned with justice 
and fair play the organizers wrote 
traficant prides himself of running against the pack several 
months ago he accused the cia of failing to reveal that it knew in 
advance that pan american flight 103 that exploded over scotland 
in december 1988 might have had a bomb aboard 
a federal appeals court has ruled that traficant owes the 
government more than 280000 in back taxes penalties and interest 
on a bribe he allegedly received as an ohio sheriff

whats the good word according to the american 
dental association its jussive or maybe grisaille 
a threemember team from the ada spelled those words as well as 
some others like cataclasm oubliette and bireme to 
beat 49 other corporate teams in an adultsonly spelling bee 
the ada team spent nearly three hours late tuesday beating out 
the rest of the top 20 teams in the second annual olsten corporate 
great grownup spelling bee an event that raised an estimated 
20000 for the literacy volunteers of chicago 
officials said it was about 10 percent of the annual budget for 
the volunteers who teach reading to adults 
its funny but since we made the finals last week weve been 
saying whats the word for today whenever we meet in the 
elevator or in the cafeteria and someone always suggests some 
obscure word said ada team member david curry 48 
a couple of days ago i asked the question and someone said 
grisaille 
someone else who said grisaille was indianapolis newsman 
lloyd a anderson the pronouncer who conducted the spelling bee 
he said it first to a threeman team from van kampen merritt an 
investment house who misspelled it griseille 
curry and his teammates sheila cassella and lois schuhrke 
spelled it right which led to jussive and the championship 
a grisaille by the way is a monochromatic painting usually 
done in shades of gray jussive means expressing or having 
the effect of a command a cataclasm is a breaking down or 
disruption an oubliette is a type of dungeon and a bireme is an 
ancient ship with banks of oars on two levels 
the winners were actually members of the adas team no 2 
ada team no 1 was the first team eliminated tuesday 
misspelling cummerbund in the first round 
the van kampen merritt team jack pace ray hoffman and rudy 
wright finished second 
they were almost eliminated in an early round when they 
misspelled beneficent but were allowed back in on a protest 
when the judges ruled that anderson had pronounced it in a 
misleading manner 
ive conducted more than 450 spelling bees over the last 25 
years and ill keep on doing it until i get it right anderson 
said 
a team from the first national bank of chicago finished third 
as bankers they had no problem with forecloseable they 
also managed words like perquisite ostentatiously and 
schuss but shih tzu a small chinese dog spelled their 
waterloo 
the team from the chicago tribune once the home of simplified 
spellings such as altho thru and burocrat lasted 
until the final rounds correctly spelling words like misogyny 
panegyrical and contumacious 
what nailed the newsmen was a word that doesnt show up often in 
newspaper copy bombilation defined as a buzzing droning 
sound 
the champions said they came by their spelling proficiency 
through their work 
my title is manager of educational services for the department 
of professional relations but basically im a speechwriter said 
curry i work with words 
ms schuhrke 45 is assistant secretary for the council on 
dental education and said she prepared for the finals by going to 
dinner in minneapolis and staying up late 
im a proofreader what more can i say asked ms cassella 
39 actually though im a literacy volunteer myself and 
teaching another adult who cant read makes you think a lot about 
the english language

michael sancilios little sister 
represents the 4yearold boys best and perhaps only hope for 
life 
doctors on tuesday drew blood from the girls umbilical cord 
during birth in hopes of using it to save her leukemiastricken 
brother 
the blood was rushed to indiana university to see if it matches 
michaels if so scientists will try for the first time to use the 
unique cells of umbilical cord blood to grow healthy bone marrow in 
a leukemia patient 
it will be several days before doctors know if there is a match 
the chances of which were rated by doctors at 1in4 
in march michael was diagnosed with chronic myelogenous 
leukemia a rare incurable form of the disease that strikes fewer 
than 1 percent of childhood leukemia victims said dr stephen 
rodgers the familys pediatrician children with the disease 
generally survive less than a year after diagnosis he said 
leukemia patients normally are treated with bone marrow 
transplants but because time is short and the chances of finding a 
compatible donor are 1in20000 doctors are attempting the new 
treatment 
on tuesday doctors at virginia beach general hospital took the 
first step in delivering christina grace sancilio by caesarean 
section they clamped off the umbilical cord and removed about a 
cup of umbilical cord blood 
rodgers said umbilical blood contains special cells called stem 
cells that develop bone marrow in babies in their first nine months 
if christinas blood matches michaels the cells will be grown 
at the university which pioneered the procedure for the treatment 
of some forms of anemia once scientists have grown a sheet of the 
cells they will inject them into michaels heart after his 
diseased bone marrow has been killed by radiation 
the new cells in theory will act as they do in a newborn 
heading straight for the bone to produce bone marrow 
with sons michael and tony in his arms anthony sancilio 35 
tried to express his joy and hope at seeing his daughter im 
speechless he said im thankful the baby is healthy and 
hopeful that we will have a match 
tests on 7yearold tony showed he was not a compatible donor 
for his brother 
dr leslie l wasserman who delivered both christina and 
michael said the collection of blood went smoothly though the 
surgical team had to make sure none of the mothers blood was mixed 
with the umbilical cord blood 
wasserman said a caesarean section was undertaken because of 
33yearold denise sancilios difficulties in delivering michael 
he said mother and baby are doing fine 
the procedure has been done twice before to treat forms of 
anemia because it has never been tried on a leukemia patient 
doctors are unsure what to expect 
this is most likely his only chance rodgers said its 
all going to take several months and michael will be close to the 
end of his disease when we try the transfusion 
even if the procedure is successful rodgers said the child 
faces a lifetime of treatment to ensure the body does not reject 
the new bone marrow

the senate upset over president bushs 
decision not to punish the soviet union for its actions in 
lithuania is urging him to put the brakes on a new ussoviet 
trade agreement 
by a 7324 vote the senate passed a resolution tuesday seeking 
a halt to any trade agreement that would grant the soviet union 
lower tariffs as long as the crackdown on lithuania continues 
the nonbinding resolution urges bush not to act on any trade 
agreements until the soviets lift their economic blockade against 
lithuania and enter into negotiations aimed at independence for the 
republic 
in a political twist the measure was introduced by a fellow 
republican sen alfonse damato of new york and supported by 
most gop senators only republican sens john warner of virginia 
and alan simpson of wyoming voted against the measure 
the measure also split democrats with senate majority leader 
george mitchell of maine supporting it and sen claiborne pell of 
rhode island chairman of the senate foreign relations committee 
opposing it 
bush decided last week not to take any action against moscow for 
its blockade against the baltic republic where a new noncommunist 
parliament declared lithuania independent on march 11 
the presidents goslow approach has drawn widespread criticism 
from members of congress particularly from those with large 
lithuanianamerican communities in their districts 
mitchell called for bush to clearly demonstrate that the 
united states supports a free and independent lithuania and opposes 
the soviet economic sanctions 
it would be unfortunate for all if the united states fails to 
make this position clear he said 
the bush administration on april 26 announced substantial 
agreement with the soviet union on a trade agreement that would 
clear the way for the soviets to obtain significantly lower tariffs 
on goods they sell in the united states officials expect the 
treaty to be ready for signing at the may 30june 3 ussoviet 
summit in washington and it also must be ratified by congress 
some of us feel that we are slipping and sliding into most 
favored nation status with the soviet union while they are still 
taking aggressive oppressive actions in the baltic countries 
said sen dennis deconcini dariz 
secretary of state james baker iii said completion of the 
outline of a new agreement did not mean bush would recommend to 
congress a oneyear waiver of high us tariffs 
but he said the ussoviet relationship ran deeper than the 
lithuanian independence issue we have a lot of interests at 
stake here that are very important interests to the united states 
of america baker said 
meantime the white house announced that bush will meet with 
lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene on thursday 
ms prunskiene an economist is coming to the united states on 
a private visit said marlin fitzwater the white house spokesman 
she also will meet with state department officials and members 
of congress and will speak friday at the national press club 
fitzwater called the meeting with ms prunskiene a rare 
opportunity to get a firsthand analysis of the situation he 
stressed however that bush has not changed policy on lithuania

the apollo capsule in which three astronauts 
died 23 years ago will be entombed with the debris of the space 
shuttle challenger in an abandoned missile silo 
the remnants of the capsule will be transferred from the langley 
research center in hampton va to the cape canaveral air force 
station in florida about may 20 the national aeronautics and space 
administration said tuesday 
astronauts virgil gus grissom roger b chaffee and edward 
h white ii died when fire flared through the capsule during a 
countdown rehearsal for the first manned apollo mission 
the fire in a cabin filled with 100 percent oxygen was 
triggered by a spark when a broken or bruised wire beneath 
grissoms couch contacted metal the astronauts were trapped by a 
wall of flame and died within seconds 
grissom and chaffee are buried side by side at arlington 
national cemetery white at west point ny 
the spacecraft has been kept in a container along with its heat 
shield other hardware and investigative data at langley as 
directed by a board that investigated the fire 
the container has been deteriorating and several small leaks 
have developed nasa said routine repairs were made to the 
container but due to its age it cannot be effectively maintained 
on a continuing basis 
the remnants of the challenger which exploded after liftoff 
jan 28 1986 were placed in the missile silo at the cape 
canaveral base after investigators were finished with them

a spending bill containing 720 million in 
emergency aid for nicaragua and panama is headed for 
housesenate negotiations after senators added a sharp warning 
against soviet punishment of lithuania 
the senate late tuesday approved its 34 billion version of the 
spending package on a voice vote sending it to a conference with 
the house that could begin as early as thursday the house passed 
its 24 billion measure on april 3 
both bills include 420 million in aid president bush sought for 
the new government in panama and 300 million for nicaraguas new 
democracy 
but both versions took on dozens of additional provisions as 
they moved through the legislative process raising numerous 
difficult issues for example the senate bill includes language 
permitting the district of columbia to use local money to pay for 
abortions for poor women and bush has vowed a veto if it remains 
in the bill 
there also is likely to be a squabble over terms for 400 
million in loan guarantees for israel to build housing for soviet 
emigres the senate version waives about 25 million in 
administrative fees while the house version allows the full fees 
to be charged 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said he supported the 
guarantees but voiced concern over israeli moves to place new 
settlers in the occupied territories and questioned whether 
concessions should be made 
what is the justification dole asked for waiving fees and 
other normal program requirements 
we also have countless tens of thousands of homeless in this 
country he said we dont hear their voice much but they 
might ask what about us 
another difference is in the lithuania provision on tuesday 
the senate voted 7324 for a nonbinding provision urging bush not 
to send congress a ussoviet trade agreement for approval until 
moscow rescinds economic sanctions against the independenceminded 
baltic republic 
in addition to foreign aid and 70 million for refugee programs 
bush had sought the bill became the vehicle for a long list of 
unrelated provisions lawmakers added hundreds of millions of 
dollars for disaster relief fighting forest fires food stamps 
veterans benefits and other domestic programs 
most of the spending would be offset by cuts in this years 
pentagon budget representing the first major application of a 
peace dividend from reduced eastwest tensions 
padding of a supplemental spending bill is common but bush 
complained about it on tuesday saying none of it related to 
nicaragua none of it related to panama all of it related to other 
priorities they had 
panamanian president guillermo endara in a speech at the 
national press club was more understanding this is the price we 
pay for democracy he said its the best system and we 
want a democracy even with all the delays 
endara said his country would use the 420 million to rebuild 
its battered economy and repair damage from the december us 
invasion which installed him in power but he said panama will not 
ask for more us economic aid next year 
by using part of the money to pay off pastdue loans to 
international banks panama would again become eligible to meet 
future financial needs through new development loans he said

member of congress are protesting president 
bushs willingness to see l william seidman the straighttalking 
boss of the administrations savings and loan bailout quit before 
his term expires 
there are problems with the savings and loan bailout but you 
dont solve that problem by shooting the messenger said rep 
bruce vento dminn chairman of a house task force overseeing the 
cleanup we need more qualified individuals and fewer 
political yes men 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater indicated tuesday that 
bush would not resist a move by seidman 69 to leave before the 
october 1991 expiration of his term as chairman of the federal 
deposit insurance corp and the resolution trust corp 
the fdic manages deposit insurance funds for banks and sampls 
while the rtc conducts the administrations thrift bailout 
bill has indicated hes not going to stay the whole term and 
we are interested in getting new leadership there that would carry 
on an aggressive program when the time comes fitzwater said 
however he denied a report in the washington post that bush 
suggested in a meeting with the regulator two weeks ago that this 
would be a good time for him to leave the newspaper quoted two 
unidentified administration sources 
the president has not asked him to leave or suggested a 
specific departure the spokesman said 
seidman appointed by thenpresident reagan in 1985 has made no 
secret of his desire to leave before the end of his term however 
despite periodic feuding with white house chief of staff john 
sununu and deputy treasury secretary john robson he had given no 
indication his departure was imminent 
reached by telephone from his hometown grand rapids mich 
where he was accepting a business award seidman declined to 
comment on the post story or on his plans for the future 
however he noted that he has said he planned to leave after 
getting the bailout agency off to a good start a month ago he 
announced ambitious plans to sell or close 140 sampls by the end of 
june and he said tuesday that would be a good start 
although he has riled administration officials with his 
independent ways seidman gets high marks on capitol hill for 
steering the fdic through the unprecedented failure of more than 
800 banks during his term and for his candor about the sampl 
industrys problems 
almost alone he has been a tellitlikeitis 
playitlikeheseesit kind of guy said rep jim leach riowa 
a senior member of the house banking committee but what is 
refreshing frankness to some on capitol hill has been grating on 
the nerves of some in treasury and perhaps in the bowels of the 
white house 
twentyfour house democrats in a letter circulated by rep 
charles schumer dny called on bush to urge seidman to stay 
they said his departure would paralyze the administrations bailout 
effort 
it is intolerable that chairman seidmans early departure may 
be the result of his frustration with the internal bickering 
bureaucratic interference and turf battles that have marked the 
first nine months of the thrift bailout effort the democrats 
wrote 
seidmans feud with sununu dates to the first month of bushs 
term when he skewered an administration proposal to charge bank 
customers a fee for deposit insurance he ridiculed the idea as the 
reverse toaster theory in which the depositor would give the 
bank a toaster to open an account 
most recently seidman has irked treasury officials by warning 
congress that the administration likely will be forced to propose a 
second installment of the bailout after this years congressional 
elections 
fitzwater said there has been no discussion of seidmans 
possible successor 
kenneth guenther executive vice president of the independent 
bankers association of america said that one of the leading 
candidates to replace seidman is comptroller of the currency robert 
clarke clarkes office regulates federally chartered banks and he 
sits on the fivemember fdic board

joe schock is still on the lam two 
decades after fleeing charges that he torched 29 national guard 
trucks and jeeps in reaction to the killing of four vietnam war 
protesters at kent state university 
yet after an odyssey through the radical underground schocks 
life has evolved into an existence similar to that he fled today 
he is a paunchy suburban father of two daughters teaching english 
to young accountants in paris 
and much to the sorrow of his family the 42yearold fugitive 
vows never to return to the united states 
ive gone down another road he said in a recent telephone 
interview with the idahonian newspaper in moscow idaho i dont 
feel good about the states i dont want to readapt 
he is a free man in france shielded from us authorities by a 
treaty that bars the extradition of political fugitives he has 
become a french citizen 
schock served as a marine in vietnam but he returned with 
growing doubts about his countrys role his skepticism intensified 
after he joined antiwar groups at idaho and washington state 
universities 
on may 4 1970 his parents and police say the deaths at kent 
state led him to go to the lewiston armory with boltcutters and 
gasoline 
he told me where the wire cutters and gloves were left where 
he left them said ed schock his father i cant say if he was 
alone but i think he did it 
police said a witness saw schock toss an object over the armory 
fence and run moments after a thunderous explosion schock flagged 
down a car but he was arrested at a roadblock his clothes reeking 
of gasoline police said 
schock neither denies nor admits involvement with the sabotage 
some day i still may have to defend myself in a us court he 
said 
he fled the country in july 1970 while awaiting trial on federal 
charges of destruction of property his family did not hear from 
him for two years 
schocks sister lois gibbens of pasco wash has not seen him 
since he left his parents have visited him in france three times 
its a tragedy in our family gibbens said 
her brother agreed my family most certainly has suffered from 
my problems 
but schock insisted he would not come home even if charges were 
not hanging over him 
if they could give me a job in lewiston at 200000 a year i 
wouldnt want to come home he said i dont want to be 
dominated by that economic system 
although a judge dismissed the indictment against schock in 
1979 prosecutors say it was merely a housekeeping chore to clear 
the books of old cases prosecutors and schocks lawyer carl 
maxey agreed that charges could easily be reinstated 
the charges carry up to 10 years in prison and a 10000 fine 
schock said he would not be received warmly by most americans if 
he came home 
theyd still hold it against me he said they wouldnt 
justify that kind of action

leftist guerrillas attacked 
strategic targets in the capital late tuesday and automatic weapons 
fire and explosions could be heard in several neighborhoods much 
of the city was without power 
there were no immediate reports of casualties 
it appeared to be the most serious guerrilla attack since 
november when the rebels launched a huge monthlong offensive in 
the capital 
the rebels dynamited five high voltage utility towers along the 
road leading north to the city of chalatenango leaving at least 
half of san salvador without electricity the privately owned radio 
station yskl reported 
the station said a rebel group also attacked an electricity 
relay station north of the city on the slopes of san salvador 
volcano 
the gunfire began around 10 pm and continued sporadically 
until early wednesday military helicopters could be heard buzzing 
several areas of the capital 
guerrilla groups shot it out with government soldiers near the 
former sheraton hotel in the western residential district of 
escalon and the gunfight spilled over into the tasumal 
neighborhood residents there said 
they said they heard automatic weapons fire and explosions that 
could have been from hand grenades or missiles 
guerrillas also trained gunfire on the police academy on the 
road to santa tecla a small town 14 miles west of the capital as 
well as a civil defense post in the southern neighborhood of costa 
rica and the national elections board building in escalon 
according to witnesses 
the fighting broke out hours before president alfredo 
cristianis rightist government and the guerrillas farabundo marti 
national liberation front were to hold indirect preliminary talks 
on seeking an end to the war 
a representative of un general secretary javier perez de 
cuellar was due to arrive in san salvador today to act as a 
gobetween in setting up an agenda and arranging other details for 
the peace talks to begin 
two attempts to negotiate an end to the war ended in deadlock in 
1984 and 1985 and a series of direct talks began shortly after 
cristiani was sworn in as president in july but broke off as a 
result of the november offensive 
more than 72000 people have been killed most of them 
civilians since the civil war began in october 1979

the short shrift that blacks and other racial 
minorities get from the us healthcare system is intolerable and 
must end an ethics panel for the american medical association said 
today 
studies dramatizing the disparities in medical treatment between 
the races go back decades but blacks are still getting less 
frequent and less aggressive care said the ama council on ethical 
and judicial affairs 
whether the racial disparities in treatment decisions are 
caused by differences in incomes and education sociocultural 
factors or failures by the medical profession they are 
unjustified and must be eliminated the council said 
not only do the disparities violate fundamental principles of 
fairness justice and medical ethics they may be part of the 
reason for the poorer quality of health of blacks in the united 
states 
american blacks have twice the infant mortality rate of whites 
and a life expectancy six years shorter the panel said in a report 
in the journal of the american medical association 
black men under 45 years have a 45 percent higher rate of lung 
cancer and 10 times the likelihood of dying from high blood 
pressure than white men in the same age group added the council 
the panel said many of the disparities also exist for other 
racial minorities but are less welldocumented 
the panel recommended a triplebarrel approach to improve health 
care for blacks greater access greater awareness and concrete 
medical guidelines for what is acceptable care 
ensuring greater access should include requiring employers to 
provide health insurance to all their workers expanding medicaid to 
all americans below the poverty level the panel said 
the panel called for a state role in helping the poor obtain 
health insurance 
robert j blendon chairman of the department of health policy 
and management at harvard school of public health said the 
recommendations most of which the ama already has made 
individually represent really a step out for an association that 
has not taken a strong stand on this issue for many years 
the panel said studies that document disparities in us medical 
care have found the following 
while black men nationwide suffered a certain type of heart 
attack at threefourths the rate of white men the blacks were only 
half as likely to get special heart xrays and only a third as 
likely to undergo bypass surgery 
although blacks accounted for 33 percent of medicare patients 
with endstage kidney disease between 1977 and 1985 they accounted 
for only 21 percent of kidneytransplant recipients 
among pneumonia patients in 17 hospitals from 1970 to 1973 
blacks were less likely to receive medical services particularly 
intensive care 
black patients surveyed by telephone in 1986 were more likely 
than white patients to report that their physicians did not 
inquire sufficiently about their pain did not tell them how long 
it would take for prescribed medicine to work did not explain the 
seriousness of their illness or injury and did not discuss test and 
examination findings

finding ways to prevent and treat diseases 
that disable the elderly can provide a cushion in the next century 
when aging baby boomers are expected to push health care costs into 
the sky researchers say 
while medical advances are keeping americans alive longer this 
may mean that more people will be at risk of becoming disabled in 
late life by such conditions as alzheimers disease and hip 
fractures 
we cant afford not to invest more now in research on aging 
said dr edward l schneider dean of the university of southern 
californias andrus gerontology center and coauthor of a study on 
the impact of aging baby boomers could have on the nations 
heathcare system 
the study reported in this weeks journal of the american 
medical association projected that medicare expenditures which 
were 71 billion in 1987 could soar as high as 212 billion in 
2040 when the average age of a baby boomer is 85 
medicare costs for those 85 and older the fastest growing 
segment of the us population could grow sixfold the study said 
nursing home costs now 31 billion for 13 million patients 
could rise to as much as 139 billion with 59 million people 
living in these facilities the study estimated 
the number of americans with conditions like alzheimers disease 
and hip fractures caused by osteoporosis two of the biggest 
contributors to nursing home admissions could quadruple unless 
ways are found to prevent or delay the onset of these conditions 
the study said 
research is also needed for other diseases that afflict the 
elderly including parkinsons disease osteoarthritis and vision 
and hearing ailments researchers said 
this is where the challenge of aging research lies said 
dr jack m guralnik an epidemiologist at the governments 
national institute on aging and coauthor of the report 
cost containment will not be enough to offset the huge increases 
in health care that will be needed in the next century the 
researchers said 
the greatest savings will be found in preventing and delaying 
the onset of the debilitating diseases that rob the elderly of 
their independence and force them to rely on others for care they 
said 
a 1 billion annual investment in alzheimers research would 
likely yield advances that could at least delay the onset of the 
disease by a minimum of five years which would save 500 billion 
in care costs in the two decades from 20002020 schneider said 
the federal government is spending about 148 million this year 
to research alzheimers disease the most common form of dementia 
in the last 100 years we have extended life expectancy 29 
years but weve done precious little research into how to make 
those last 29 years quality years sen tom harkin diowa said 
at a briefing where the study was released on tuesday 
harkin chairman of the senate appropriations subcommittee that 
deals with medical research said he will introduce legislation to 
increase federal financing of aging research from the current 400 
million to 1 billion annually 
were either going to invest now or pay later he said 
joseph califano jr once secretary of the old department of 
health education and welfare and a national spokesman for project 
independence for older americans said the study findings show that 
the most costeffective research the united states can put money 
into now is in aging research

nuclear weapons reactors shut down for nearly 
two years because of safety and environmental concerns would resume 
production early next year under a new energy department schedule 
energy secretary james d watkins announcing the planned 
restart of three reactors at the savannah river plant in south 
carolina said his department also is reviewing a proposal to 
resume production this summer of plutonium warhead triggers at its 
rocky flats plant in colorado 
at this time there does not seem to be any alternative for 
the nation other than keeping rocky flats on line to deal with 
warhead management watkins told a senate armed services 
subcommittee tuesday 
he said the department plans to restart its k reactor at the 
savannah river plant in december and after a period of lowpower 
testing begin producing tritium for nuclear weapons in january 
the p and l reactors at savannah river would be restarted in 
march and september 1991 respectively with production of weapons 
components from each to resume a month after their startup 
watkins said 
all three reactors at savannah river have been shut down since 
mid1988 and operations at the rocky flats plant were suspended 
last november bringing the restocking of the nations strategic 
weapons stockpile to a halt 
watkins said the government has spent 75 billion in the past 
three years on modernizing the savannah river and rocky flats 
facilities to bring them up to current environmental and safety 
standards 
environmentalists and antinuclear activists particularly 
those living near the plants called for a continued moratorium 
and have vowed to fight reopening the plants in court 
several unresolved issues relating to restart of the savannah 
river reactors remain on the table its much too soon for 
secretary watkins to announce a restart schedule said brian 
costner director of the energy research foundation of columbia 
sc an environmental group 
but watkins expressed confidence his department can now defeat 
any legal challenges saying it will release draft environmental 
impact statements this friday on the resumed operation of the 
savannah river reactors 
a month ago for the first time i began to feel comfortable 
about savannah river he told the strategic forces and nuclear 
deterrence subcommittee i hadnt felt that way before 
everything has turned around down there 
although the department and appointed outside experts have not 
yet completed their reviews and approved the schedule for resuming 
operations at rocky flats watkins said he anticipates making a 
formal announcement on it next month 
he also said he was looking at opening the waste isolation pilot 
plant in new mexico to its first shipment of military nuclear 
wastes in october or november 
he said he envisions only a very modest amount of wastes 
moving to the new mexico site initially primarily for research 
testing its suitability as a permanent burial ground for such 
wastes 
despite lingering environmental concerns senators at the 
hearing agreed that the united states cannot afford to continue 
forestalling a resumption of weapons production 
i wish i could say we dont need any production of weapons 
material said the subcommittees chairman sen j james exon 
dneb that is not the case the soviet union is going to be 
relying on its nuclear deterrent as a strategy more than ever 
before 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said the soviets have 11 
weapons production reactors in operation including three for 
making plutonium despite a marginally greater stockpile of 
plutonium than the united states 
they have the capability to turn a switch on and make more we 
dont he said 
watkins declined to discuss in detail the state of the nations 
tritium stockpile other than to say it is deteriorating at a rate 
of 55 percent a year with the savannah river reactors shut down 
were going through a very dramatic period now he said 
before the hearing went behind closed doors for a classified 
briefing on the stockpile in the near term we can meet the 
majority of our national security requirements

senate republicans are seeking to grab the 
initiative on campaign finance reform with a proposal to ban all 
political action committees but set no overall spending limits 
republican leaders on tuesday unveiled a package supported by 34 
of the senates 45 gop members as democrats continued haggling 
behind closed doors on their proposal 
republicans are tired of being accused of obstructing 
reform said sen mitch mcconnell rky the primary author of 
the gop package the real problem in campaign finance is the 
source of political money not how much spending is necessary 
he accused democrats of trying to railroad through congress a 
bill with spending limits because it serves the partisan 
interests of the democratic party by curtailing republican 
fundraising advantages 
leading democrats responded with a willingness to consider the 
abolition of pacs whose donations in recent years have tended to 
benefit incumbent democrats over gop challengers but only in 
exchange for establishing ceilings on spending 
the most important factor in any reform proposal must be 
limits on spending said senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine he called the republican package disappointing because 
it rejects such limits 
theres plenty of room for negotiations said oklahoma sen 
david boren chief author of the democratic bill which mitchell 
plans to bring to the senate floor possibly later this week 
were perfectly willing to eliminate pacs too boren said 
as long as it is within the framework of total comprehensive 
reform and that means overall spending limits without that 
youll just have this continuing chase for money in other 
forms 
however several democrats including a large number up for 
reelection in 1992 have vigorously defended pacs as have some 
republicans 
mitchell and republican leader bob dole of kansas said they 
believe a bipartisan consensus can be found 
we can either get serious or continue to make speeches and 
protect the status quo on capitol hill dole said were 
serious about this were willing to work out any differences with 
the other party 
but in the last week both party caucuses in the senate have 
moved away from the concept of flexible spending ceilings proposed 
as a compromise in march by a panel of experts appointed by 
mitchell and dole 
it would have placed fixed limits on how much a candidate can 
solicit from individuals and pacs outside his or her state but 
imposed no ceiling on small contributions from instate residents 
republicans in their package were willing to cut the current 
1000 limit an individual can give to a campaign to 500 for 
outofstate donors but rejected any limit on the totals that can 
be raised from either source 
democrats are still insisting on an overall ceiling that also 
would cap the amount of allowable instate contributions but they 
disagree among themselves on how much to curb pac activities 
there must be 15 versions said alabama sen howell heflin 
one of the two senate democrats who defected from the partys 
position and helped republicans sustain a filibuster against a 
campaign reform bill two years ago 
republicans acknowledged the courts likely will reject their 
call for a ban on pacs as an unconstitutional abridgement of 
freedom of speech and association 
as a fallback position their package includes a provision 
abolishing corporate and union pacs but allowing socalled 
nonaffiliated issue pacs such as those maintained by groups 
on both sides of abortion gun control and environmental issues 
however the ceiling on contributions from those nonaffiliated 
pacs would be cut from a total of 10000 for both primary and 
general elections to 2000 
the gop package also would ban socalled soft money 
unreported expenditures by corporations unions trade associations 
and public interest groups 
the gop bill however would continue to allow contributions by 
individuals to state party organizations to go unreported

a real estate broker who embezzled 2 
million in federal housing money to live like a playboy drew six 
years in prison from a judge who observed no wonder we have the 
national debt we do 
cy walker 50 was also fined more than 2 million tuesday and 
ordered to make 2 million in restitution 
walker stole from the department of housing and urban 
development in 198687 and bought 180000 in sports cars an 
18000 speedboat furs and jewelry 
us attorney jim wilson said walker was not connected to 
highlevel hud officials but he said the fact that walker 
could have pulled this off is indicative of the weaknesses in hud 
under the reagan administration 
the agency is under investigation for alleged fraud 
embezzlement influencepeddling and political favoritism under 
thensecretary samuel pierce 
walker had pleaded guilty to embezzlement and tax charges as 
part of the plea bargain he served as an informant in a drug sting 
that led to the conviction of a racehorse trainer 
the tragedy of this case is not only that you committed the 
crime but that you were able to get away with it for so long 
us district judge joel dubina said 
i hope that since this happened hud has established a system 
of quality control the court is shocked to think how much 
money was embezzled nationwide no wonder we have the national debt 
we do 
walker had a hud contract to handle closings of agency property 
in the montgomery region a hud audit found that he diverted 
closing money to a personal bank account then depleted it when the 
scheme was discovered

ethnic koreans are disappointed with a new 
agreement on their legal status because it ends fingerprinting for 
only the youngest descendants of koreans brought over during world 
war ii for forced labor 
the agreement reached in seoul on monday between the foreign 
ministers of south korean and japan clears the way for president 
roh taewoo of south korea to visit japan in late may 
it allows third and succeedinggeneration koreans to live in 
japan permanently and exempts them from fingerprinting a 
requirement now for all foreign residents of japan there are fewer 
than a dozen thirdgeneration koreans in japan all of them infants 
japan ruled korea as a colony between 1910 and 1945 when the 
war ended with japans defeat and the korean peninsula was divided 
into the capitalist south and the communist north 
among the 700000 koreans living in japan boys and girls 
under the age of 15 number about 120000 the agreement means that 
they still have to have their fingers printed when they reach the 
age of 16 like criminal suspects said hwang youngman 
secretary general of the proseoul korean residents union 
japan retained the right to keep such records on first and 
secondgeneration koreans who were granted permanent resident 
status under the 1965 japansouth korea normalization treaty 
similar status has been granted to the roughly 200000 members of 
the pronorth korea organization the general association of korean 
residents in japan 
japan and north korea have no diplomatic relations 
when bilateral talks on the issue were reported to have hit 
snags earlier this year over the fingerprinting issue roh came 
under pressure from opposition and human rights groups to cancel 
his scheduled may trip 
roh will be the second south korean president to visit japan 
his predecessor chun doohwan visited tokyo in september 1984 
when the late emperor hirohito told him at a state dinner it is 
indeed regrettable that there was an unfortunate past between us 
for a period in this century and i believe that it should not be 
repeated again 
pak jae ro a vice chairman of the pronorth korean group said 
he believed the agreement would bring little change to the 
legal status of korean residents he noted that the seoul agreement 
calls for a new registry to replace the present alien registration 
card for the third and succeedinggeneration korean residents 
it means that japan will invent a new method of registration 
and will continue surveillance of koreans he said 
japans alien registration law requires all foreign residents 
over the age of 16 to carry a registration card that contains a 
copy of their fingerprint 
many korean residents in japan complain that they have the same 
tax and other obligations as japanese but do not have the same 
rights to education job opportunities social security and welfare 
programs

wisconsins chippewas already under 
attack from sportsmen for taking advantage of 19th century treaties 
letting them spear fish off the reservation have begun exercising 
their right to cut timber as well 
four indians began logging in a state forest tuesday but it was 
more ceremonial than commercial they cut a couple of trees for 
the tv cameras said ralph hewett a state department of natural 
resources spokesman 
they really couldnt get started because they were waiting for 
some shearing equipment hewett said 
the mole lake chippewa band was authorized to begin cutting wood 
for free in the northern highlandamerican legion state forest 
north of minocqua the forest is among those used by the states 8 
billionayear paper industry 
federal courts since 1983 have said that the chippewas 
according to 19th century treaties under which the tribe ceeded 
northern wisconsin to the us goverment may hunt fish trap and 
cut timber on public property 
since 1983 they have exercised only the right to spear fish 
encountering sometimes violent protests by fishermen who fear game 
fish will be depleted 
if nonchippewas were to cut the timber made available tuesday 
they would have to pay about 160000 for it the wood is free to 
the chippewas 
so far the mole lake band is the only one of wisconsins six 
chippewa groups seeking to cut timber 
hewett said the logging is under interim rules adopted by the

the government denied a news report that 
riot police killed two people at an unauthorized opposition 
demonstration that occurred one week after the president lifted a 
20year ban on opposition parties 
the official zairean news agency azap on tuesday disputed the 
report which was carried by a french news agency and confirmed by 
opposition sources 
at the same time the government reportedly demanded that the 
news agencys reporter prove that his report was true 
also tuesday the government canceled its annual may day labor 
parade an hour before it was scheduled to start the official may 
day march joined for the first time by unions independent of the

held next year in this sprawling central african nation of 32

progress later confirmed the news report saying the killings 
occurred when police broke up a rally by 300 people outside the 
home of one of its leaders 
the rally had not been officially approved by police 
authorities decided sunday that political rallies in the capital be 
subjected to police permission

zsa zsa gabor has been slapped with 
an extra 60 hours of community service for serving most of an 
earlier sentence at her mansion 
municipal judge charles rubin on tuesday said fundraising from 
the belair mansion was not what he had in mind last year when he 
sentenced miss gabor 72 to 120 hours of community service for 
smacking a beverly hills motorcycle policeman 
the judge tacked on the extra time after vern davis executive 
director of a shelter in venice said miss gabor had spent about 50 
hours there and the rest of the time at home organizing a june 8 
fundraiser for the shelter 
it means nothing to miss gabor buying community service 
hours she is a wealthy person the judge said after meeting with 
miss gabor he said the actress was more interested in 
selfpromotion than paying her debt to society 
miss gabor later told reporters i served food why do i have 
to promote myself im so damned famous its sickening

ruth duff was in palm springs calif 
last week when she turned on the television and saw her home here 
consumed by molten rock 
on tuesday she came back to look at the lava where her home 
used to be 
i was in my house watching the news when i saw my house 
burning she said then i thought maybe it was just as well i 
wasnt here 
duff lived in the kalapana gardens subdivision for 23 years 
after she and her husband bought most of the land from a developer 
in 1968 she and her husband john purchased about 600 lots put 
in roads and began to sell and lease them 
on tuesday she pointed across the street to six lots the first 
of which was not more than 50 yards away from the lava 
these lots here we bought them from the catholic church a few 
years ago she said they must have known something we didnt 
kilauea the worlds most active volcano has destroyed 126 
homes since its latest eruption began in 1983 
civil defense spokesman lanny nakano said the 2000footwide 
lava flow was spreading out and moving east across kalapana gardens 
subdivision 
five homes burned down tuesday as the lava flow moved about 300 
yards from the kalapana store and drivein the towns meeting 
place molten rock had moved to within 15 feet of three more homes 
late tuesday nakano said 
a second lava flow poured in from the north nakano said it was 
moving downhill 1000 feet from homes and could reach homes by the 
weekend 
about a hundred yards from the kalapana store workers dug up 
ground around the star of the sea church preparing to pick up and 
move the painted church so dubbed by locals because of its 
brightly decorated interior 
behind the church some newly homeless families frolicked in the 
ocean seemingly oblivious to the molten rock heading their way 
a woman at the store watched the workers and shook her head 
its sad she said they dont have any faith a lot of 
people dont want to move it 
gov john waihee arrived by helicopter tuesday to meet with 
county and federal disaster officials visit workers at the church 
and say hello to the owner of the store whom he sends christmas 
cards every year 
waihee said the federal government needed to change the way it 
was looking at the calamity the governor has declared the kalapana 
a disaster area in hopes the federal government will do the same 
and open the door to aid 
they see this and say how can you call this a disaster 
he said but weve lost more than 100 homes now

protesters are demanding that interim president ion iliescu resign 
because of his communist past

we will not give up until the clique of reds is removed 
the protest has also caused a diplomatic row with france the 
government officially protested today the actions of two french 
parliament members who addressed the crowd on university square on 
tuesday 
the university square protest which has occurred virtually 
roundtheclock since april 22 is the most visible against the 
interim government as the country prepares for its first free 
elections in more than 50 years on may 20 
five major opposition parties threatened on monday to boycott 
the elections saying more time is needed to prepare for the vote 
they accused iliescus national salvation front which dominates 
the provisional governing coalition of monopolizing power 
on tuesday the interim government guaranteed equal chances to 
all parties contesting the election and offered to meet the 
opposition parties to discuss their criticisms 
the government said claims that the front was harassing 
opposition activists and using facilities left by the deposed 
communist party can be discussed with representatives of the 
government to eliminate any kind of suspicions and to improve 
some organizational aspects of the elections 
the opposition parties which repeatedly have accused the front 
of using public funds for electioneering and unfairly dominating 
the national media had no immediate reaction to the government 
statement 
on tuesday 8000 anticommunist protesters gathered in 
university square to demand iliescus resignation 
they protesters claim the front is filled with former communist 
party members who advocate neocommunism iliescu is a former 
communist party official who became a critic of deposed dictator 
nicolae ceausescu 
the front has dominated the interim coalition government that 
came to power during the december revolution that resulted in 
ceausescus execution 
two visiting french parliament deputies jeanclaude mignon and 
jeanpierre ferrand both from a rightwing party spoke to the 
crowd occupying university square tuesday 
government spokesman cristian unteanu told the associated press 
that only romanias very good relations with france saved the 
two french deputies from being expelled from the country they 
should have been declared persona non grata as in any civilized 
country unteanu said 
he said prime minister petre roman had strongly protested the 
deputies behavior in a telephone call today to french prime 
minister laurent fabius

when the vote was announced after a secret ballot goencz won 
339 votes of the 370 votes cast the post of president is largely 
ceremonial in hungary 
goencz replaces interim president matyas szueroes a member of 
the socialist party that grew out of the old communist party and 
governed until being roundly defeated in free elections in march 
and april 
szueroes was elected one of three deputy speakers historian 
gyoergy szabad 66 and a founding member of the democratic forum 
was voted goenczs chief deputy with 348 votes vince voeroes 
leader of the smallholders party was the third deputy elected 
goencz promised to uphold hungarys new democratic system 
saying i know that confidence cannot be returned only lost 
his spoke in a brief thankyou address to hungarys first 
democratic parliament in more than 40 years 
before the vote a year to the day after hungary opened the iron 
curtain and paved the way to eastern europes revolt against 
communism deputies filed into parliaments lofty chamber newly 
stripped of its communist coat of arms 
the insignia of the old peoples republic renamed simply 
the republic of hungary in october was removed just last week 
in another gesture symbolizing hungarys transition from 
communism to democracy many deputies arrived from st stephens 
cathedral reviving a longlost tradition of attending mass before 
opening parliament 
the deputies also bid a formal farewell to the caretaker 
government of socialist miklos nemeth likely to be replaced this 
month by jozsef antall leader of the hungarian democratic forum 
which won the elections 
goencz a lawyer who entered politics after world war ii as a 
member of the then dominant smallholders party has headed the 
hungarian writers union since last december 
he spent six years in jail after the 1956 revolt against 
stalinism before winning a reprieve on his life sentence in the 
general amnesty of 1963 
at a news conference before the vote antall said his party and 
the rival free democrats also had agreed that parliament and not 
the nation as a whole would choose the final president 
goencz is likely to get that post once a coalition government is 
formed by midmay and the constitution is amended likely in early 
june antall said at a joint news conference with free democrat 
leader peter toelgyessy 
unlike other east european nations where the move away from 
communism was swift and dramatic hungary shifted toward democracy 
in gradual steps led by reformminded communists over the past two 
years 
one of its boldest moves was to begin demolishing iron curtain 
fortifications along the border with austria exactly one year ago 
the move encouraged a westward exodus of east germans 
despite the reforms of hungarys communists four decades of 
repressive rule built up so much popular anger that their socialist 
successors won only 33 seats in the recent elections 
hungarys politics are now dominated by the centerright and 
strongly nationalist forum and the liberal league of free 
democrats founded by former dissidents 
the forum wants to form a majority coalition with the 
likeminded agrarianbased independent smallholders who have 44 
deputies and the christian democrats who have 21 
the sessions opening minutes were laden with gestures intended 
to link hungarys new democracy with spells of past liberty 
an actor gave a stirring rendition of a poem by sandor petoefi 
the firebrand leader of the failed 1848 revolt against austrian 
hapsburg rule in which the poet called on hungarian lawmakers to 
build a new country better than the old 
otto von habsburg the former crown prince of hungary and a 
member of the european parliament was present

the two german states agreed on a plan today 
for merging their economies settling basic differences over how 
the nations should assess the costs of unification officials said 
the tentative agreement sets the stage for a full merger of the 
economies of the two nations on july 2 
the nations have been negotiating for weeks over how west 
germany can absorb the decimated east german economy without 
threatening the strength of the powerful west german mark 
the agreement was confirmed by mathias gehler spokesman for 
east german prime minister lothar de maiziere and rudolf seiters 
chief of staff for west german chancellor helmut kohl 
the plan calls for exchanging the nearly worthless east german 
marks at a 11 rate for the west german mark which will become the 
currency of east germany in july 
the rate would cover wages rents and pensions but would only 
apply to small savings accounts in a concession to east german 
demands the west german government agreed to a higher ceiling on 
the bank accounts of elderly east germans 
several protests have been held in recent weeks by east germans 
demanding protection from the widespread unemployment expected to 
occur when east german enterprises are forced to compete in the 
free market 
east germans who still only will earn about onethird of their 
west german counterparts also fear rising prices and the loss of 
subsidies when the nations are united 
west germans meanwhile fear that absorbing the east german 
economy will dilute the power of the mighty west german currency 
and lead to higher taxes and inflation 
savings accounts above 2300 would be exchanged at a 21 rate 
however the 11 rate would apply to accounts of up to 3530 for 
east germans aged 60 and older and up to 1180 for those of east 
germans aged 14 and younger 
debts owned by east german enterprises estimated to total 153 
billion would be converted at a 21 rate 
some economists say the debts should be forgiven so east german 
businesses and factories can have a fresh start when they enter the 
free market 
chief west german negotiator hans tietmeyer a director of the 
west german central bank said the bundesbank was in agreement with 
the proposal 
the bundesbank previously had said that a basic 11 conversion 
could lead to higher interest rates 
the former east german government valued the east german mark at 
a 31 rate but it truth it was virtually worthless in western 
markets 
a full political merger between the germanys likely will take 
place next year the four world war ii allies that divided the 
country the soviet union united states france and britain are 
to meet this saturday in bonn to discuss the international 
implications of unification

the united states will suffer a sharp loss of 
influence in europe if americans withdraw their troops west german 
defense minister gerhard stoltenberg says 
in the past american cooperation and influence on european 
policy was helpful and in future american policy and influence in 
europe can be helpful stoltenberg said tuesday evening 
but without any soldiers or significant numbers of soldiers 
your influence in all matters of security policy will sharply 
decline he added and i doubt whether this is desirable 
stoltenberg said in a speech before the american institute for 
contemporary german studies of the johns hopkins university that 
americans should maintain a substantial military presence for the 
foreseeable future 
he said the united states might be able to reduce its forces in 
central europe beyond the 195000 troops proposed by president 
bush if that could be coordinated with european allies and the 
soviet union 
the defense minister met with defense secretary dick cheney 
earlier tuesday and they discussed german unification and other 
european issues pentagon spokesman pete williams said 
a pentagon source who spoke on background said the officials 
discussed problems with eastwest talks in vienna to cut 
conventional forces in europe he declined to say what the problems 
were 
stoltenberg called on the north atlantic treaty organization to 
retain nuclear forces in europe but said their numbers should be 
greatly reduced

west german president richard von 
weizsaecker arrived today on an official fourday visit as poland 
seeks guarantees for its borders in upcoming negotiations on german 
unification 
von weizsaecker the first west german head of state to visit 
poland began his trip just days before the two germanys and the 
four victorious world war ii allies the united states soviet 
union britain and france are to meet in bonn to discuss the 
international implications of german unification 
von weizsaecker was greeted at warsaws airport by president 
wojciech jaruzelski and prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki the head 
of the solidarityled government 
he is scheduled to hold talks with both polish leaders as well 
as other dignitaries including solidarity leader lech walesa and 
cardinal jozef glemp the roman catholic primate 
the west german president will also visit the former nazi death 
camp at treblinka and the city of gdansk where the first shots of 
world war ii were fired 
von weizsaeckers trip marks a new stage in the difficult and 
sometimes bloody relations between poland and germany 
west germany is polands largest western trading partner and 
its support is critical to the success of the economic and 
political reforms undertaken by the new noncommunist government 
but with an older generation that recalls the devastating world 
war ii invasion and nazi occupation poland harbors feelings of 
bitterness and distrust toward germany that has come to the fore in 
the rush toward unification 
poland is seeking a seat at unification talks to guarantee its 
postwar western border and wants a treaty with the two germanys 
and the new government of a united germany making the boundary 
permanent 
drawn along the oder and neisse rivers the postworld war ii 
boundary incorporates into poland 40000 square miles of land that 
was former german territory 
this week poland submitted a draft treaty to the two germanys 
and the four world war ii allies us secretary of state james a 
baker iii and foreign ministers from the other countries will meet 
in bonn on saturday to discuss german unification 
on the eve of his visit von weizsaecker offered assurances to 
poles on the border issue 
the essence of the border problem has been unequivocally 
settled we cannot argue over territories and borders in europe any 
more von weizsaecker told polish television tuesday 
todays issue of the prosolidarity newspaper gazeta wyborcza 
welcomed von weizsaeckers visit with the headline this german 
inspires confidence over a profile outlining the west german 
presidents long support for polands border concerns 
kohl made a historic emotional and at points controversial 
visit to poland in november the trip was interrupted for a day 
when kohl returned to germany for emergency meetings as the east 
germans began to dismantle the berlin wall

a camp counselor who drowned trying to save 
three teenagers in icy convict lake in february had used marijuana 
within five hours of his death forensic toxicologists said 
randall porter 41 was lauded as a hero for his dying efforts 
to save the youths but investigators have questioned whether the 
youths were properly supervised when they went onto the thin ice of 
the sierra nevada lake 
the toxicological tests of a sample of porters blood dont 
indicate whether his judgment was impaired by the drug said dean 
warden a forensic toxicologist with the state department of 
justice 
the test however indicates porter had used marijuana within 
five hours of his death warden said tuesday 
results of toxicological tests on the other victims of the feb 
19 tragedy were negative according to the mono county sheriffs 
department 
three juvenile offenders housed at camp oneal fell through the 
ice and drowned during an outing four adults including porter and 
another counselor drowned trying to save the youths 
mono county prosecutors declined to file criminal charges in the 
drownings but the toxicological test on porter could be a factor 
in possible civil suits 
the state department of social services suspended camp oneals 
license in march for allegedly failing to provide proper 
supervision and care for the 34 teenage boys sent to the camp by 
probation and social service officials

a telephone company worker who claimed 
racial harassment forced her to quit after 13 years with southern 
bell has been awarded 1 million by a federal jury 
mary ann vance claimed that twice in 1984 she found a noose 
hanging from her work station at the companys jacksonville 
warehouse 
the award tuesday came in a second trial after a 35 million 
jury award in 1987 was thrown out as unreasonable and excessive 
thank you jesus thank you mrs vance said as she embraced 
friends in the courtroom when the verdict was announced 
dana bradford a southern bell attorney said the company will 
appeal the verdict by the allwhite jury 
mrs vance 41 charged she received inadequate training and was 
subject to unfair disciplinary actions from managers because she is 
black she testified that she heard after finding the nooses that 
one of her supervisors had placed them at her work station to 
increase productivity 
southern bell attorneys contended mrs vance created the noose 
incidents and suffered from a severe behavioral disorder that 
caused much of the stress she attributed to southern bell 
they said the stress from five failed marriages and financial 
troubles not racial harassment was the cause of her problems 
jurors deliberated more than four hours before reaching a 
verdict they awarded mrs vance 500000 in punitive damages and 
511500 in compensatory damages to cover past and future wages as 
well as medical costs 
mrs vance has been undergoing weekly therapy for anxiety since

a leading soviet newspaper said today that columns 
of angry protesters who marched through red square on may day 
insulted president mikhail s gorbachev and may engender a backlash 
antigovernment demonstrators were allowed to parade past 
lenins mausoleum for the first time tuesday in the traditional may 
day ceremony they shouted shame at the soviet leadership 
unfurled lithuanian national flags and carried signs bitterly 
critical of the leadership 
the extent and content of the public criticism was unprecedented 
for gorbachev in his five years as soviet leader 
he and the other leaders gathered on top of the mausoleum left 
after about 20 minutes of the protest but it was not immediately 
apparent whether they left because of it 
however the tuesday evening edition of the government newspaper 
izvestia said that in those conditions gorbachev and the rest of 
the leadership had to leave red square 
today was the last day of a threeday holiday for soviets and 
there was no comment on the may day protest by soviet officials 
but izvestia said the informal groups who gathered at least 
100000 protesters for the march for some reason thought that 
only by completely running down the government only with direct 
insults of the president could they show their bravery and speed up 
changes in the country 
we dont exclude that in the end they may achieve some kind of 
acceleration it added but the whole question is to what side 
will the changes be 
the protesters were pressing for more rapid change than 
gorbachev has allowed but the soviet leader also is under pressure 
from more conservative people who think he is moving too fast 
those forces the article implied could cause a conservative 
backlash 
speakers at a rally organized by trade union officials before 
the may day march warned of inflation and unemployment if the 
government goes ahead with plans to develop a market economy 
gorbachev impatiently tapped his fingers during the protest but 
otherwise showed no emotion 
izvestia accused the leaders of the demonstration of 
elementary political illiteracy it added that some of the 
banners and chants were aimed at direct confrontation with 
constitutional authority 
pravda the communist party daily carried a report on the may 
day parade on its front page but buried any comment on the protest 
in one paragraph near the end 
the informal groups it said unfortunately did not restrain 
themselves from extremist slogans containing provocative gross 
and insulting attacks against constitutional authority 
nationwide television showed less of the may day festivities 
than usual and the coverage was cut off before the unofficial 
protest began other soviet newspapers carried reports only about 
the official part of the celebration

president f w de klerk and 
african national congress leader nelson mandela pledged today to 
abolish apartheid as they launched historic talks on ending white 
minority rule 
de klerk and mandela said the government and the rival anc would 
seek to quickly clear the way for fullscale constitutional 
negotiations on bringing the 28million black majority into the 
national government 
mandela standing next to de klerk in front of a palatial dutch 
colonial mansion where the talks will take place through friday 
said swift progress was vital and the patience of blacks was 
running out 
we must succeed in the endeavor to remove these obstacles so 
that we can together move forward as rapidly as possible to end the 
inhuman system of apartheid mandela said 
the anc has been seeking discussions with whiteled south 
african governments since the organization was founded in 1912 
de klerk also called for rapid progress he challenged the anc 
to help end a wave of violence that has claimed hundreds of lives 
in recent months and said all political parties must make every 
effort to restore peace 
the vast majority of south africans desire the negotiation 
process aimed at a new constitution to get started in all 
earnest de klerk said 
the anc is demanding the government end a state of emergency 
release all political prisoners and allow the return of all anc 
exiles as preconditions for fullscale constitutional talks 
de klerk stressed that the white government was acting on behalf 
of all south africans and wanted to create a multiracial democracy 
where the right of all individuals would be equally protected but 
he said growing violence and racial division was a threat to hopes 
of peace 
confrontation will get south africans nowhere our joint 
destiny demands that all of us steer clear of it he said 
de klerk expressed hope that the two sides would make quick 
progress and overcome the obstacles blocking full negotiations 
there is cautious optimism as well as faith and conviction that 
our problems will be solved by negotiation 
the government has accepted the challenge of doing everything 
possible to achieve this he said 
mandela who complimented de klerk on his speech said the talks 
were an important step toward ending apartheid he cautioned that 
black south africans wanted immediate change and the two sides had 
to make rapid progress 
the black nationalist leader denounced the policies of white 
minority rule saying racial superiority and segregation could 
never again be the basis for politics and society in south africa 
he said blacks would never again accept that they had to be 
inferior to whites 
the pace at which we move to arrive at a just solution should 
be informed by the fact that the black masses of our country demand 
and expect fundamental change now and not tomorrow the people as a 
whole want the peace and stability which can only come about as a 
result of the total abolition of the apartheid system mandela 
said 
mandela attempted to reassure whites by saying there would be no 
discrimination against them in a future multiracial democracy in 
a gesture the majority of whites who are of dutch heritage he made 
the assurance in the afrikaans language 
the subject of violence on both sides was expected to be a major 
point of discussion the anc demands that the government control 
police violence and end the national state of emergency that gives 
officers wide powers and makes them almost immune from prosecution 
for any act 
de klerk and other government officials have asked the anc 
leaders to stop their calls for armed struggle and have expressed 
displeasure at the continuing recruitment of guerrillas into the 
ancs military wing which was founded by mandela 
joe modise commander of the military wing said on tuesday 
night that spear of the nation would continue recruiting 
members inside south africa because the south african defense 
force and white rightwing groups are continuing to recruit 
modise who is a member of the anc delegation in the talks said 
he was not surprised that the government team did not include 
defense minister magnus malan i nearly didnt come myself 
said modise the army is the enemy on one side the anc 
guerrilla wing is the enemy from their point of view 
modise and joe slovo the white leader of the south african 
communist party could both be charged with capital crimes under 
south african law because they have headed the ancs military wing 
de klerk assured them they would not be arrested so they would 
come to the talks from their exile headquarters in lusaka zambia

arpad goencz the writer and former 
political prisoner chosen interim president of hungary on 
wednesday dedicated his life to fighting the hardline communist 
leaders who were ousted last year 
in 1948 when the communists seized control goencz lost his job 
as a prominent editor and was forced to work as an unskilled 
laborer 
in 1956 he was at the forefront of hungarys shortlived revolt 
against stalinism and paid for his involvement with six years in 
jail he won a reprieve on his life sentence under a 1963 amnesty 
once free goencz began translating british and american novels 
into hungarian and later published several of his own novels and 
short stories 
by the 1970s he became associated with dissidents who signed 
petitions and published underground literature in a campaign to get 
the communist authorities to be more democratic and respect human 
rights 
he joined with them in founding the league of free democrats 
now hungarys secondlargest political party in may 1988 
a stout balding grandfather goencz was born in budapest in 
1922 he trained as a lawyer and graduated in 1944 from the citys 
respected university he immediately entered politics under the 
thendominant smallholders party 
the smallholders won control of parliament in 1946 goencz then 
editor of a budapest weekly seemed set for a prominent career with 
the conservative party that drew its strength from the farmers 
running hungarys agrarianbased economy 
the communist takeover in 1948 changed his fortunes while 
evidently failing to dent his commitment to democracy the twist of 
fate apparently made goencz philosophical about his newfound 
political stardom 
i would not call myself a professional politician goencz 
said when elected head of the writers union in december the 
homo politicus and the writer in me are one what is now taking 
place is the realization of my political dreams not of my career 
wishes he said of hungary 
after vaclav havel in czechoslovakia goencz is the second 
writerpresident in newly democratic eastern europe there is a 
great conspiracy of international writers goencz joked to 
western reporters after his election 
goencz was a surprise choice for interim president in a may day 
agreement hammered out by the free democrats and the victors of 
last months free elections the hungarian democratic forum 
the conservative forum expected to forge a centerright 
coalition government with two likeminded parties later this month 
apparently wanted to stress national unity as hungary faces a 
mounting economic crisis 
goencz is expected to be named to a full fouryear term as 
president once the coalition is formed and parliament in june 
passes constitutional amendments that would give the legislature 
not the nation the task of naming a full president as interim 
president goenczs powers are largely ceremonial and in line with 
those of the presidents of many west european states 
the president is commander in chief of the armed forces and is 
empowered to initiate a plebiscite negotiate international 
agreements and exercise clemency for prisoners under the current 
constitution the president may serve a maximum of two fouryear 
terms

departments legal adviser abraham sofaer and his iranian 
counterpart jaromi eftekhar to discuss claims disputes the 
iranus claims tribunal is the only official forum where the two 
nations meet 
the meetings take place almost monthly in the hague a us 
source said on condition of anonymity he decribed tuesdays 
meeting as routine 
president bush has praised both iran and syria for their roles 
in the release of robert polhill on april 22 and frank reed on 
monday the men were among eight americans believed held in beirut 
by proiranian groups 
iran and syria have said all 16 remaining western hostages in 
lebanon should be freed both countries reportedly are anxious to 
establish closer ties with the west 
but bush has said he wont deal to free the hostages 
a special state department team was questioning reed for a 
second day today in a search for inforamtion about the remaining 
western captives 
the private usiranian talks were believed to center on a 
settlement of all socalled small claims of under 250000 
those claims comprise the bulk of the caseload of the tribunal 
charged with settling billions of dollars in claims between the two 
nations arising from the 1979 iranian revolution 
so far the arbitration panel has presided over the settlement 
of more than 22 billion in financial disputes stemming primarily 
from expropriations by the iranian government 
us and iranian tribunal officials have repeatedly denied 
reports that their negotiations touch on the hostage issue 
the officials as they have in the past are here to discuss 
legal and technical issues concerning tribunal cases us 
embassy spokesman leonardo williams said 
the 9yearold claims tribunal was set up as part of the 1980 
algiers accords that brought freedom to the us diplomats held 
hostage in the us embassy in tehran for 444 days 
secrecy is a hallmark of the proceedings which occur in a 
converted hotel on a quiet residential street 
the claims are handled by three socalled chambers each of 
which has an iranian an american and a thirdnation arbitrator who 
acts as chairman 
ninetyfive percent of the claims were filed by american 
companies against iran a small number were filed by iranian 
commercial entities against us companies and the us government 
the largest is irans claim against the united states for 
militaryrelated items ordered by the prerevolutionary government 
of shah mohammad reza pahlavi the claim known as b1 amounts to 
up to 11 billion 
various iranian officials in the past have tied progress on the 
hostage issue to progress on that claim as well as the return of 
frozen iranian assets 
but the us government says much of the military equipment was 
never paid for and is being held by contractors over which the 
united states has no influence 
the tribunal source said 11 billion has so far been transferred 
to iranian control about 6 billion of that was used by iran to 
pay western bank loans 
the amount of iranian funds still frozen in accounts runs only 
into the millions the tribunal source said 
the tribunal is seeking a way to settle the small claims 
together and wipe out the remaining caseload of 2450

president lee tenghui today chose the 
countrys top military official to be the new prime minister in a 
surprise move that opposition leaders denounced as a setback for 
democracy 
defense minister hau peitsun the countrys only fourstar 
general said he accepted the offer to head the government during a 
meeting with the president the 71yearold hau would replace lee 
huan 73 in about two weeks 
president lee said the country needs me hau said in a 
television interview i thought i should not defy him 
hau who would be the first general to become prime minister in 
27 years said the proposed appointment does not mean the military 
will interfere in politics there are many such precedents in 
democratic countries he said 
lee is expected to formally announce haus appointment may 20 
when he is sworn in as president for a new sixyear term the 
nomination must then be approved by the parliament which is 
controlled by members of the ruling nationalist party 
opposition leaders reacted to haus nomination with suspicion 
and expressed concern about its impact on recent moves to 
liberalize the countrys political system 
chen shuipien a lawmaker from the democratic progressive 
party denounced the appointment as a move to drive taiwans 
democracy backward 
another opposition leader jiang pengchien called haus 
nomination odd and inappropriate an apparent compromise with 
the military 
he expressed concern that the military would take it as a signal 
to interfere more in politics 
the military has mistaken our societys newly emerged 
pluralism as social chaos and wants to stamp out opposition 
voices jiang said 
the nationalist party has gradually eased its authoritarian grip 
in recent years lifting martial law allowing opposition 
political parties and bringing more of the native taiwanese who 
account for 85 percent of the islands 20 million people into 
government 
but hau belongs to the nationalist partys old guard that fled 
to taiwan with generalissimo chiang kaishek after losing a civil 
war to the communists on the chinese mainland in 1949 
some politicians also wondered how haus appointment would 
affect the gradual easing of restrictions on contact with mainland 
china that has resulted in hundreds of thousands of taiwan 
residents traveling to the mainland 
the government now also tolerates indirect investment and trade 
with the chinese mainland and is under pressure from businessmen to 
further broaden contacts 
hau is among the nationalist conservatives who still dream of 
returning to china to overthrow the communists and he may be 
expected to take a fairly hardline stance on relations with 
beijing 
however he may still be an acceptable choice to chinese 
communist officials because he shares their view that taiwan is 
part of china and should not abandon the goal of eventual 
reunification 
political observers say lees move to appoint hau represents an 
attempt to broaden his power base and stem criticism among aging 
nationalist conservatives who have questioned his pragmatic 
policies toward their enemies in beijing 
lee is the first native taiwanese to serve as president and head 
of the ruling party he succeeded chiang chingkuo chiang 
kaisheks son who died in office in january 1988 
hau was appointed defense minister last year after being chief 
of the 500000member armed forces for eight years

efforts to cut us medical costs should leave in 
place the safety mechanisms that catch mistakes doctors make in 
prescribing drugs says a researcher who documented hundreds of 
such errors at a new york hospital 
the study in todays journal of the american medical association 
found an average of 2 errors a day in written prescriptions at 
640bed albany medical center hospital in 1987 one in five 
mistakes could have been serious or fatal 
medication errors are an all too common occurrence in the 
provision of modern health care and one of the many hazards of 
hospitalization the researchers said 
doctors at albany wrote 289411 prescriptions in 1987 and 
errors occurred in 905 of them including 182 mistakes that could 
have caused severe harm or death if they had gone undetected the 
researchers reported 
however quality assurance procedures operative within our 
hospital and in most healthcare systems appear to be quite 
effective said timothy s lesar assistant pharmacy director for 
clinical services and the studys coauthor 
all these errors were averted they never put a patient at 
risk he said in a telephone interview monday 
five years ago an error by two doctors in administering a drug 
to a pregnant cancer patient at albany led to better drugcontrol 
procedures there the researchers said 
the patient was left comatose and near death and her premature 
baby later died the hospital was cited by the new york health 
department for lacking effective policies to control dangerous 
drugs 
now for written prescriptions the hospitals pharmacists enter 
doctors orders into a computer that checks them again against 
patient data about drug allergies and other information 
researchers said 
in new york hospitals overall in 1984 drugs accounted for 20 
percent of the 27000 treatmentrelated patient injuries according 
to dr howard h hiatt head of a harvard medical school study 
released last month the study did not identify the number of 
injuries that might have been caused by physician errors 
things do fall between the safety net neil m davis 
professor of pharmacy at temple university school of pharmacy in 
philadelphia said today he said the albany study documented 
what pharmacists have always known 
hospitals better have good pharmacy units davis said in a 
telephone interview adding that pharmaceutical services tend to 
need strengthening in intensive care and newborn care units 
the albany study found an error rate of 313 per 1000 orders 
written of the 905 errors 522 or 577 percent were 
significant meaning they could have caused adverse 
consequences the researchers said 
mistakes varied from ordering too strong a tranquilizer for the 
size or age of a patient to prescribing penicillin or a related 
drug to a patient allergic to it 
researchers found higher error rates in obstetricsgynecology 
and surgeryanesthesia than in other services possibly reflecting 
less time or emphasis on nonsurgical aspects of patient care during 
training programs they said 
error rates were higher among firstyear residents and declined 
with successive years of training the researchers said 
mistakes were highest during daytime hours when large numbers 
of prescriptions were being written and lowest during evening 
hours suggesting fatigue is not a factor in prescription errors 
the researchers said

today he was held for months at a time with four other westerners 
including two americans and that he is angry they have not been 
freed 
reed was released to syrian officials in lebanon on monday after 
3 years in the hands of shiite moslem fundamentalist kidnappers 
he is now at the us air force hospital in wiesbaden for medical 
tests and debriefings 
i tell you im very very angry that anderson tom and 
terry are not free 57yearold reed said from a hospital 
balcony 
reed referred to terry anderson the associated press chief 
middle east correspondent and the longestheld hostage in lebanon 
and thomas sutherland an american educator anderson was kidnapped 
on march 16 1985 while sutherland was seized on june 9 1985 
for gods sake its nearly the sixth year for these men im 
absolutely embarrassed im out before they are reed said i 
spent two years wih tom and terry 
i have not seen tom and terry for awhile and i dont know 
where they are reed said 
reed also said he spent three years in the intermittent company 
of john mccarthy of britain and brian keenan of ireland reed said 
he had been kept in the same house with them since october and the 
three were also together periodically for three years 
mccarthy 33 a journalist for the londonbased worldwide 
television news agency wtn was kidnapped april 17 1986 and 
keenan 39 disappeared six days later no group has claimed to be 
holding either mccarthy or keenan 
earlier reeds wife fahima said her husband was kept with up 
to six other western hostages during his captivity 
a special state department team was to resume questioning reed 
for a second day today they seek clues about the 16 remaining 
westerners held hostage in lebanon six of whom are american 
mrs reed a 39yearold syrian moslem said that whenever a 
hostage was taken away her husband thought that captive was being 
freed she said that upon his release reed was surprised and 
angered to learn others remained captive 
our joy will not be complete until every single one of them is 
free mrs reed told a news conference 
while the educator underwent medical tests mrs reed disclosed 
details of her husbands imprisonment she said he was blindfolded 
and bound for almost his entire captivity except for 90 minutes 
during the evenings 
mrs reed said during that time reed was allowed to watch 
television or read magazines or books but he refused these 
things were so trivial compared to the things that were snatched 
away she said 
mrs reed said her husband was moved around a lot 
upon his release reed telephonedrelatives of several western 
hostages 
in london a group pressing for the release of mccarthy said 
reed told them of mccarthy and keenan they are both well they 
have some minor health problems they exercise daily and read 
voraciously 
peggy say andersons sister said reed told her terry was in 
reasonably good health although he had been having physical 
problems he said terrys attitude was still feisty as far as 
the guards go and he was always screaming for something to read 
on tuesday reed was flown from damascus syria to west germany 
for the medical tests and debriefings and was reunited with fahima 
his second wife and their 9yearold son tarek 
he celebrated freedom with a steak and a beer and showed no 
initial signs of serious health problems though doctors said he 
lost significant weight and muscle mass during his 43 months in 
captivity and felt tired and weak 
a hospital statement said reed would probably be at the hospital 
for the next two to three days 
the founder of a private school in beirut reed was the second 
american hostage to be freed in nine days robert polhill freed 
april 22 went through the same battery of medical tests and 
questioning last week 
the wiesbaden hospital has become the ritual stop for freed 
american hostages on their way home hospital specialists are 
experts at comforting freed hostages and helping them with 
postcaptivity psychological shocks 
the first group of excaptives to go through the wiesbaden 
hospital were 52 americans held in tehran until their release in 
january 1981 
at the time of his abduction sept 9 1986 reed ran the private 
lebanese international school which he founded after the 
international college had been bombed out

a drug can reverse the loss of vertebral bone and 
prevent fractures in older women with osteoporosis a common cause 
of disability among the elderly according to a study 
danish doctors who tested the medicine called etidronate found 
that while it halted the loss of bone in the spine it did not 
affect bones in other parts of the body 
an estimated 15 million to 20 million americans have 
osteoporosis the condition is blamed for 13 million fractures 
annually in people over age 45 it is especially common among older 
women when their bodies make less estrogen after menopause 
the research directed by dr tommy storm at sundby hospital in 
copenhagen was published in thursdays new england journal of 
medicine it was financed by procter amp gambles norwich eaton 
pharmaceuticals which makes etidronate 
the doctors performed a threeyear comparison study on 66 women 
who ranged from age 56 to 75 when it was over they found that the 
vertebral bone mineral content of those who got the drug increased 
7 percent but it decreased 3 percent in a comparison group who got 
dummy pills the number of vertebral fractures also decreased 
substantially in the etidronate group 
although we do not know whether the dose and treatment regimen 
used in our study are optimal our results are encouraging the 
researchers wrote 
the medicine has been approved by the us food and drug 
administration for treatment of pagets disease of bone

legislators at an international conference on 
the environment today passed a resolution calling for nations to 
commit themselves to a 50 percent total reduction in globalwarming 
pollutants over the next 20 years 
the legislators from 42 nations also called for other steppedup 
efforts to deal with the environment including creation of a 
global marshall plan to help developing countries cope with 
environmental concerns 
the threeday conference concluded with overwhelming approval of 
a reduction timetable for globalwarming pollutants pushed by the 
us congressional delegation which hosted the conference 
the resolution contrasts with bush administration policy which 
has advocated more research before specific pollution controls are 
proclaimed 
the resolutions and goals approved by the interparliamentary 
conference on the global environment are not binding on any nation 
but some participants said they hoped to use the conference report 
to sway fellow legislators back home about the need to take 
specific actions on environmental matters 
i hope that this is going to be the beginning the beginning 
in which we can have a global survival dialogue attiya 
inayatullah a member of the parliament of pakistan told reporters 
more than 200 lawmakers from 42 nations including the soviet 
union most european countries japan and many developing nations 
participated in the conference 
the conference agreed to establish a broad range of 
environmental goals including actions aimed at protecting the 
ozone layer reversing the loss of forests and committing greater 
resources to population control 
the policy statements however provided few specifics on how 
some of these efforts would be funded including the proposed plan 
by industrial nations to help developing countries deal with the 
environment 
this socalled global marshall plan for sustainable 
development and the environment would be patterned on the 
postworld war ii economic assistance efforts by the united states 
that help european recover from the war officials said 
sen albert gore dtenn one of the organizers and other us 
delegates had pushed for a consensus in a closing policy 
declaration that the time to act is now to deal with such 
issues as global warming 
one resolution that was approved calls for immediate action on 
setting specific goals for reducing manmade pollutants including 
carbon dioxide that cause global warming or the greenhouse effect 
delay exposes us our children and their children to 
calamities which we will have made irrevocable by inaction in the 
present the draft resolution declared 
the strong statement for action drafted by the us delegates 
to the conference is in sharp contrast to the bush 
administrations position that additional research into global 
warming and its potential economic impact is needed before specific 
pollution curbs should be set in concrete 
nevertheless gore and sen john chafee rri stressed that 
the gathering was not intended to embarrass president bush two 
weeks ago he caused rumblings among delegates to a white house 
conference on global warming by emphasizing the need for study over 
development of specific response strategies 
in contrast the legislative delegates drafted a globalwarming 
resolution that scarcely refers to the need for more research and 
calls for setting a timetable for specific cuts in global warming 
pollutants by the year 2010 
the resolution calls for a roughly 20 percent reduction in 
carbon dioxide a product of burning fossil fuels total 
elimination of chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs and a variety of other 
ozonedepleting chemicals and a 10 percent reduction in methane 
emissions 
altogether that would amount to about a 50 percent reduction in 
globalwarming pollutants by 2010

the arizona republic phoenix on the automobile industry 
not too long ago the americanmade automobile was a cherished 
symbol of national power and the envy of the world times have 
changed today the us auto industry is under siege and those 
shiny models of what was right with america have come to symbolize 
what is wrong 
the numbers tell the story in 1960 general motors ford and 
chrysler made more than half the worlds cars today they account 
for less than a third 
what went wrong the london economist offers a simple answer 
the japanese but more is involved than just the talents and 
enterprise of toyota honda and nissan detroits complacency 
along with what the economist calls a string of badly designed 
badly made cars in the late 70s invited disaster 
the japanese took advantage by raising quality and lowering 
prices 
by almost any measure detroit has improved but so have the 
japanese and at much lower cost even though production has been 
shifted to the united states if japanese car makers expand their 
us operations as expected predicts the brookings institution 
110000 new american jobs will be created by 1992 
americas auto industry has used the import quotas as the 
economist says to fatten executives bonuses and to help delay 
painful reform 
staring again into the face of economic death detroit has a 
choice it can learn from its competitors streamline its 
operations and become responsive to market demand or it can stand 
pat and anguish over the loss of the american edge

los angeles daily news on the camarena slaying 
no matter how important the arrest of dr humberto alvarez 
machain to stand trial in los angeles in the 1985 tortureslaying 
of enrique camarena of the us drug enforcement administration 
was to the dea the manner in which the agency reportedly brought 
alvarez into the united states arranging his abduction by offering 
a reward to mexican kidnappers who seized him in guadalara on april 
2 was out of bounds 
it subverted mexicos legal process and violated that countrys 
sovereignty 
while mexico has been victimized by many acts of corruption it 
is insulting for the united states to treat its neighbor as though 
it were so thoroughly and incorrigibly corrupt that american 
authorities could not depend on it to bring criminals to justice 
through legal channels 
furthermore the united states cannot expect other nations to 
follow due process of law which means among other things giving 
fair treatment to american citizens suspected of crimes if it 
goes on making end runs around mexicos legal system

the telegraph nashua nh on lithuania 
it looks like lithuania has gotten the message no country will 
come to the baltic countrys defense in its present confrontation 
with the soviet union not even the united states which we all 
know likes to sound off that theres nothing better on earth than 
democracy and freedom 
president bush last week began by sounding tough on the soviet 
unions plan to make lithuania knuckle under by shutting off 
supplies of oil natural gas and other vital materials to the small 
republic 
but when the time came to enact trade sanctions against the 
soviets in support of lithuania bush did a repeat of his beijing 
waltz he finally declared it was not in the best interest of 
further ussoviet union peace moves to help lithuania despite 
all his earlier sympathetic talk about lithuanias desire for

las cruces nm sunnews on lithuania 
a lot of people want president george bush to get tough with 
mikhail gorbachev about soviet pressure on tiny lithuania we think 
bush has been wise to adopt a cautious and restrained stance he is 
really not in a position to help lithuania very much but he could 
do great damage to the progress toward democracy in eastern europe 
we doubt that the most vocal critics of bushs policy have 
really thought much about the consequences if their advice was 
followed some we suspect are just posturing in support of what 
they conceive to be a popular cause 
it is easy to sympathize with the lithuanians annexed by force 
to a huge nation that oppressed and impoverished them but in a 
time of soaring expectations it is easy to expect too much 
the peoples of eastern europe have made tremendous strides 
toward freedom that were unimaginable little more than a year ago 
things are moving swiftly in the right direction it would be 
unwise to throw a monkey wrench into the process at this point 
what would be gained by doing so

the news and courier charleston sc on lithuania 
by playing tough guy mikhail gorbachev is winning important 
points with moscow hardliners who view any attempt to leave the 
federation as a dire threat to the integrity of the ussr as a whole 
president bushs decision outward decision that is to keep 
handsoff gives gorbachev carte blanche to do whatever is 
necessary short of invasion to keep lithuania in the fold 
helping gorbachev maintain his political equilibrium may 
satisfy washingtons geopolitical interests but it does not 
address the moral dilemma the united states faces an angry 
lithuanian president landsbergis raised serious questions when 
responding to bush he said can the freedom of one group of 
people be sold for the freedom of another what then is the idea 
of freedom itself 
surely these same questions were asked by congressional leaders 
as they met with bush prior to his announcement the 
presidents answers obviously satisfied a broad crosssection of 
americas political leaders we hope however that what bush 
said was transmitted also to landsbergis at the very least he 
is owed that much

the parkersburg wva news on racism 
professional baseball player jose cansecos claim hes a victim 
of racism should outrage every american 
canseco plays for the oakland athletics after signing a new 
contract for the coming year he had a few words to say to the 
press he was upset the as didnt agree to pay him more canseco 
is a hispanic who came to the united states from cuba the reason 
he didnt get a better contract is racism opined canseco 
his contract is for 2 million for one year 
various adjectives could be used to describe accurately a 2 
million a year contract for a baseball player racist isnt one 
of them 
people who have been victims of racism should be enraged at 
cansecos idiotic insensitive comment leaders of civil rights 
groups fighting true racism should condemn canseco for his 
egotistical outburst baseball fans should display their 
displeasure perhaps by letting as management know they dont 
appreciate canseco such expressions of concern might be 
particularly appropriate coming from members of minorities who have 
trouble scraping up the increasing price of admission to a 
professional game 
racism hardly with 2 million to invest and produce enough 
income to keep him on easy street for the rest of his life canseco 
never will experience some of the most difficult aspects of real 
racism thats a shame it might make him more sensitive to the 
plight of people who have real problems instead of imagined ones

the world coos bay ore on baseball 
its going to be interesting to see whether professional 
baseball collapses under its own greed or survives to maintain its 
place as americas favorite game of summer 
fresh on the heels of the strikelockout this spring comes 
news that television viewers across the nation are going to be 
short on chances to watch their favorite games this summer 
the saturday game of the week an american tradition as deep 
as hot dogs and cracker jacks is gone it was murdered in the 
crossfire of a corporate bidding shootout between nbc and cbs the 
winner cbs plans to give sports fans only 16 games this season 
and it might have been only eight if the public hadnt complained 
 
how long can baseball survive with fans who can only see 
occasional games on regular tv or cable tv or have to shell out 
lots of money for a satellite system or have to find time for 
longdistance travel to a game 
baseball has been a game of the common man a slow summer 
respite from the busy american lifestyle its history is one of 
being open to all exclusivity has never been a factor 
but greed seems to be leading baseball astray

the journal times racine wis on the americas cup 
perhaps it was appropriate that the final decision on the winner 
of the americas cup the super bowl of sailing was made in a 
courtroom far removed from the sea 
it epitomized the fact that the americas cup has been made a 
mockery as a premier sailing event and like so many other sports 
has become primarily a legal exercise 
for the record the new york court of appeals sitting in 
albany awarded the americas cup to the san diego yacht club in 
effect ruling that the catamaran used in the last races was not an 
illegal craft 
the appeal of the san diego yacht club victory had been filed by 
the loser new zealands mercury bay club 
the race was sailed in september 1988 and the outcome has been 
filling lawyers pockets ever since 
so san diego has the cup and we can look forward to another 
americas cup race in 1992 supposedly possession of the cup is 
vital to a city because it means millions of dollars in revenue to 
the host city during the races 
but we cant help wondering if the legal skirmishes and the 
ruling which pretty well opens the race to virtually any kind of 
vessel havent severely tarnished the cup 
we wont be surprised if when 1992 comes around many sailing 
enthusiasts simply shrug and say as we are tempted to who 
cares

told them 
they are both well they have some minor health problems they 
exercise daily and read voraciously 
mr reed said john had grown a beard and keeps fit by

his envoy terry waite 50 who disappeared jan 20 1987 after 
leaving his beirut hotel to negotiate the release of hostages no 
group has claimed to be holding waite 
even though mr reed appears to have no direct news of terry 
waite i am encouraged both by the release of the two american 
hostages and by the good news of brian keenan and john mccarthy 
runcie said in a statement 
in interviews with bbc tv and radio ms morrell said reed told 
her mccarthy was kept blindfolded most of the time but that he 
was getting news about the campaign for his release and was 
getting the messages that we put to him in the newspaper in 
beirut 
its just the best thing ive heard in four years its 
amazing she said

television news agency wtn was kidnapped april 17 1986 as he 
drove to beirut airport to leave lebanon 
keenan 39 is from belfast in britishruled northern ireland

angloirish national and was traveling on an irish passport

another mccarthy supporter catherine comerford said reed had 
been with the two for quite some time im not sure exactly how 
long he says that john is fit and well and able to walk about 
and do pressups have a bit of exercise so he seems to be in good 
shape 
it is fantastic news weve waited so long to hear anything as 
concrete as this so obviously were over the moon 
ms morrell said she had spoken to the british foreign office 
about the news and hoped the british government would now talk to 
the syrian and iranian governments about releasing the hostages 
if they britain didnt know it before then they certainly 
know it now that this is the way to go 
britain has no diplomatic relations with syria and iran and says 
it will do no deals for the release of the britons missing in 
lebanon

a conference on curing homosexuality 
through sports and therapy has drawn fire from some health 
professionals and gay activists who say homosexuality cannot cured 
because it is not a disease 
the utah chapter of the national association of social workers 
voted 65 last week not to allow social workers who attend the 
conference to receive academic continuing education credit for 
doing so the conference is set for friday and saturday 
evergreen foundation a group describing itself as a nonprofit 
organization of former homosexuals and friends is sponsoring the 
event 
evergreen president alan seegmiller a licensed clinical social 
worker said organizers believe homosexuality is caused by a 
gender inferiority complex originating in early childhood that 
can be turned around if a homosexual wants to change 
but psychiatrist r jan stout said the american psychiatric 
association dropped homosexuality as a mental disorder in 1973 
no one knows the causes of homosexuality but biological 
factors seem to be the most important whether youre homosexual or 
heterosexual stout said most professionals have a consensus 
view that psychological and social factors dont cause 
homosexuality 
we no longer talk about treatments or cures for 
homosexuality said stout homosexuals can change behavior 
sometimes through will power but that doesnt change their sexual 
orientation 
robert austin utah aids foundation said homosexuals will 
explain their concerns during registration sessions but they wont 
be disruptive you dont change peoples minds by stopping 
discussions he said 
seegmiller said his group has no scientific studies to back up 
the groups program because were more interested in helping 
people he said he knows of at least six individuals who changed 
their sexual preference from participating 
seegmiller said the group advocates therapy to deal with 
healing the inner child of the past the organization also 
sponsors activities traditionally associated with men such as 
basketball and softball 
the men learn skills that enable them to participate in 
athletic games they never learned before said seegmiller some 
have found it helpful to seek training in automobile mechanics 
whatever they feel is a deficient in their role that seems helpful 
to them

state police sealed 
off a mohawk reservation to outsiders and posted officers to keep 
the peace today after two indians were shot to death in a 
9monthold battle over casino gambling 
the slayings were the first fatalities in the dispute that has 
torn apart the 14000member reservation with gunfire and arson up 
to 600 mohawks fled to a refugee center in ontario last week after 
a week of nightly violence 
were trying to maintain some type of stability state 
police capt richard garrant said today were trying to ease 
some of the tension 
early tuesday 22yearold matthew pyke a casino opponent was 
slain while walking in the reservation in snye quebec during a 
gun battle between pro and antigambling factions the reservation 
straddles the uscanadian border 
later tuesday jr edwards 30 a member of the progambling 
warriors society was found dead next to his house not far from 
where pyke was shot 
in response gov mario cuomo sent more than 100 state police 
troopers to escort 95 to 100 canadian police through the new york 
section of the reservation 
at a late morning news conference cuomo said he has also 
ordered national guard troops to be on standby canadian military 
and some new york national guard units provided support services 
tuesday night but no military force was used cuomo said 
asked why he was not sending the national guard onto the us 
portion of the reservation cuomo said my position is we will 
not send in the military force because of the risk of bloodshed 
cuomo said one of his aides henrick dullea was en route to the 
reservation to meet with mohawk leaders cuomo said negotiations 
to settle the dispute could begin as early as next week he said 
late tuesday police sealed off all roads leading onto the 
reservation but later permitted residents to enter on the condition 
they stay in their homes 
garrant said an unspecified number of troopers would remain 
stationed throughout the reservation until formal negotiations 
between the governors office and the indians begin 
the whole community is being held hostage said diane 
lazores spokeswoman for the warrior society she said hundreds of 
troopers were stationed in the reservation and were not allowing 
indians to move about she said people werent allowed back on the 
the reservation to deliver food 
we have a hundred people here who havent eaten in 18 hours 
she said 
garrant denied lazores accusations they say a lot of 
things he said 
although there have been nightly confrontations between indian 
factions including a hand grenade attack on a mohawk police 
station last week that injured three people state police have 
seldom entered the reservation 
police had treated the dispute as an internal matter some 
indian leaders consider the reservation sovereign territory over 
which only mohawks have law enforcement powers 
thousands of rounds go off every night here said rudy hart 
who owns a dutyfree store on the reservation it got to the 
point where people thought somebody had to die nobodys willing to 
compromise they wont give in 
the issue of gambling on the reservation has been at the center 
of escalating violence since last summer when an fbiled gambling 
raid triggered a 12day standoff between a progambling group and 
state police 
the fbi had claimed the mohawks had violated federal gaming 
regulations the mohawks claim they are not bound by state or 
federal gambling laws 
progambling forces say the reservations six casinos which 
draw busloads of patrons from the northeast with their slot 
machines craps tables and other games are an economic boon 
opponents argue they encourage prostitution and drug use and 
threaten traditional ways 
antigamblers blamed the warriors society an armed group for 
the first slaying and said cuomo had let the situation get out of 
hand 
after my house has been shot at and two deaths now is the 
time for the governor to get off of his fingers said barbara 
montour 
governor cuomo finally woke up and realized that there are 
some grave afflictions here said barbara barnes a spokeswoman 
for the antigambling faction 
minnie garrow answering calls at the warriors headquarters 
denied the group was responsible for the slaying and added we 
feel badly about the loss of life 
last summer a mob of angry antigamblers burned down a casino 
sporadic shootings and other violence were reported in the fall and 
winter but tensions mounted in march when gambling opponents 
blockaded roads leading to the reservation to keep outsiders away 
from the highstakes casinos 
last week progamblers tore down the blockades in a hail of 
gunfire the first injuries came thursday when one of the barricade 
leaders was beaten and suffered a fractured skull

the senate budget committee today adopted a 
democraticproposed 12trillion budget for 1991 that cuts defense 
spending 99 billion below what president bush wants 
the package was adopted on a vote of 149 with all of the 
committees democrats joined by a single republican sen charles 
grassley riowa in voting for the measure 
the proposal mirrors the plan passed by the 
democraticcontrolled house tuesday both packages are seen by many 
lawmakers as a prelude to possible negotiations between the white 
house and the democratic majorities in congress on a spending plan 
for the next fiscal year 
budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn said the budget 
would address a new era in which economic vitality will be the 
true measure of strength of the nation rather than just solely 
military strength 
the proposal would set defense spending at 2939 billion in the 
fiscal year that begins oct 1 that is 99 billion less than the 
figure bush has proposed and about 2 billion below this years 
spending 
the proposal claims to reduce next years deficit by 43 billion 
by taking credit for 13 billion in defense cuts 139 billion in 
new tax revenues and 62 billion in new user fees and other 
receipts the growth of benefit programs such as medicare would be 
slowed by 56 billion while other domestic and foreign aid efforts 
would be cut by 35 billion 
the senate action came a day after the house adopted its own 
democraticwritten budget on a partyline vote that also attacks 
bushs defense programs 
with all 174 voting republicans oposing the package the house 
adopted its own 124 trillion spending plan on a 218208 vote 
the plans key contrast with bushs proposal was its defense 
figure 2955 billion 83 billion less than the president it 
also spent more for social programs than the president requested 
republicans accused democrats of forcing through a plan that 
excessively weakens american military power 
all you have to do is say im really mad about lithuania and 
ill prove it im going to gut the navy said rep newt 
gingrich of georgia the no 2 house gop leader 
but democrats said their proposal merely acknowledged the 
obvious the cold war has eased and it is time for the government 
to focus on domestic issues 
the key problems we face as a nation are addressed in this 
budget said house speaker thomas s foley dwash 
after the vote democratic leaders said they viewed their budget 
as a strong bargaining position for future talks with the senate 
and the administration 
foley house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif 
and others conceded that negotiations with the administration will 
be needed for the budgets priorities to be translated into future 
spending and tax laws the budget merely maps the governments 
fiscal plans 
the housepassed package claims to slice 36 billion off the 
deficit relying on defense cuts 139 billion in new taxes and 
other savings 
this allows it to meet the grammrudman laws requirement of a 
1991 deficit of no more than 64 billion 
meanwhile defense secretary dick cheney ordered a review of 207 
military projects for possible cancellation he complained that 
some members of congress want to cut the defense budget even as 
they plead to save the projects in their own states and districts 
cheney also extended a worldwide freeze on military construction 
projects affecting 7 billion in new contracts until june 15

maronite catholic religious leaders 
appealed for a maritime ceasefire wednesday as rival christian 
forces fired on passenger ferries near each others ports 
police said no casualties were reported in the latest round of 
fighting 
the ferries which operate out of cyprus provide the only 
regular link to the outside world for christians trapped in their 
310squaremile enclave north of beirut which is ringed by hostile 
syrian troops and their mainly moslem militia allies 
on wednesday rebel troops loyal to gen michel aoun and the 
lebanese forces militia led by samir geagea continued their 
maritime battle the latest flareup in their 3monthold power 
struggle for control of the christian enclave 
a police spokesman said an armed speedboat manned by lebanese 
forces militiamen intercepted the virgin butterly a hydrofoil 
ferry before dawn wednesday off of aouns only sea outlet the 
makeshift port of dbaye seven miles north of beirut 
the spokesman who cannot be identified under existing 
regulations said the militiamen did not try to seize the 
hydrofoil but fired warning shots from a 145mm machine gun to 
prevent it from heading for aouns port 
the spokesman said the virgin butterfly was not hit by the 
gunfire but sailed back to the cyprian port of larnaca 
aouns gunners responded by shelling another ferry the sunny 
boat as it waited to pick up passengers in the geageacontrolled 
port of jounieh five miles north of dbaye 
the sunny boat raced for the open sea as shells exploded in the 
water around it the police spokesman said there were no reports 
that the ship had been hit 
the maritime fighting has flared up since geagea imposed a naval 
blockade april 23 on the threemile stretch of coast controlled by 
aoun in a bid to prevent seaborne supplies of weapons and 
ammunition from reaching the generals forces 
geageas militia with 6000 fighters and 30000 reservists has 
one gunboat and about 20 speedboats armed with machine guns and 
rocket launchers 
aouns 19000man army lost most of its naval force when 
geageas forces seized the naval base at jounieh in february the 
general has two crippled gunboats trapped near dbaye 
the ferry attacks prompted maronite catholic religious leaders 
to seek a maritime ceasefire 
to that end bulos naaman former head of the order of maronite 
monks met with aoun and planned to see geagea later radio 
stations reported 
naaman refused to comment to reporters after his meeting with 
aoun 
by police count 920 people have been killed and 2448 wounded 
since jan 30 when the inconclusive battle began between geageas 
militia and aouns troops the worst conflict between christians in 
lebanons 15yearold civil war 
aoun has refused to recognize the syrianbacked government of 
president elias hrawi objecting to the 40000 syrian troops in 
lebanon geagea supports the hrawi government 
on wednesday the rival christian forces dueled with howitzers 
and mortars in east beirut and kesrouan province to the north 
but the fighting did not spread to the shellshattered resort 
town of kleiat in the mountains northeast of beirut where civilians 
have staged a sitin under a huge tent in the main square to 
protest further violence 
the sitin began tuesday evening after the expiration of an 
81hour ceasefire called by the maronite church to allow local 
townspeople to salvage what was left of their property

mayor tom bradley today proposed a water 
rationing program that would require citizens to cut water use 10 
percent below 1986 levels to cope with the fourth year of drought 
in california 
the measures bradley has asked the city council in the nations 
second largest city to adopt include penalties in the form of 
surcharges for excess water use and hiring of more department of 
water and power employees if needed to enforce the cutbacks 
the mayor proposes to change the citys fivephase drought 
ordinance the city has been in phase 1 voluntary water 
conservation since 1988 but there has been little compliance 
modifications to phase 2 which requires mandatory conservation 
include a recommended 3 surcharge per billing unit plus 15 
percent of the water bill allowing dwp to assess penalties for 
chronic violators and installation of flow restricters and service 
shutoff having customers use 1986 as the base year for determining 
at what level each household will conserve water 
under existing law a city council resolution is needed to 
implement the penalty aspects of the ordinance 
the bradley plan was outlined today in a statement from the 
mayors office prior to a news conference at city hall 
last month bradley called for a voluntary 10 percent cutback in 
water use but he told reporters on monday that the public has 
not gotten the message and said he was determined to go 
forward with a waterrationing program 
a plan involving possible fines for violators would mark the 
most drastic step yet to confront a water shortage estimated at 10 
percent by the regional metropolitan water district 
this may well set the tone for southern california said 
carl boronkay mwd general manager i think the mayor is taking a 
leadership position 
the mwd supplies 60 percent of all water to los angeles and the 
sixcounty area stretching from the mexican border to ventura 
county like other agencies its water supplies have been reduced 
by the fourth consecutive year of drought in california 
city water officials have said it could take several months to 
get a rationing plan rolling

the doortodoor portion of the 1990 census 
spreads out to the nations smaller cities and towns thursday 
census workers who began their household count in 110 larger 
cities april 26 are expanding to the remaining 374 census districts 
across the country according to bureau spokesman ray bancroft 
only about 63 percent of the nations households have returned 
census forms mailed in late march the bureau had hoped for a 70 
percent response and the shortfall will raise the price of the 
count by millions of dollars because of the expanded doortodoor 
effort 
the national count every 10 years is required by the 
constitution for use in reapportioning seats in the house of 
representatives the figures also are used to apportion seats in 
state legislatures and divide hundreds of billions of dollars in 
federal and state aid 
minority groups say past counts have missed more poor and 
minorities than whites and higher income people 
lower educational and income levels larger household sizes and 
the more frequent presence of distant relatives in households are 
major factors in these undercounts population analyst david j 
fein said in demography the journal of the population association 
of america 
fein of abt associates in bethesda md estimated that as many 
as 15 percent of puerto ricans 12 percent of blacks and 9 percent 
of mexican americans were omitted in the 1980 census 
census bureau figures were lower than that but the agency did 
estimate that while it missed about 14 percent of all americans 
the rate may have been as high as 6 percent for young black men 
the possibility of adjusting the 1990 figures to account for 
this undercount has been proposed and debated by politicians and 
statisticians the commerce department parent agency of the census 
bureau has said it is trying to do a complete count and will 
consider adjustment only after the basic census effort is done 
a coalition of cities and interest groups has filed suit against 
the bureau seeking to force a statistical adjustment of the final 
census figures 
forms for millions of americans were delayed by addressing 
mistakes while millions of others simply havent mailed theirs 
back the problems including large apartment buiildings and whole 
blocks and small towns seemingly overlooked have drawn heavy 
criticism for the census bureau 
in the last few decades the system of mailing census 
questionnaires and asking people to return them has become common 
practice it replaced the traditional but laborintensive process 
of having someone visit every home 
now the doortodoor count is reserved for sparsely populated 
areas and followup on people who dont answer by mail 
originally expected to cost 13 billion this year the price of 
counting americans could well increase by 180 million or more 
according to congressional sources 
in rural areas which were not included in the mailed portion of 
the count personal visits by census takers have been going on 
since march

a former federal housing official who admits 
taking bribes testified today that a federal hud grant was 
arranged for a project after its developer appealed to thenvice 
president george bush 
dubois l gilliam an imprisoned former deputy assistant 
secretary of the department of housing and urban development 
resumed testimony today about scandals at hud and described in 
detail how officials there steered projects to political friends 
including members of congress 
gilliam who is serving an 18month federal prison sentence was 
testifying under a court grant of immunity from further prosecution 
under questioning by rep tom lantos dcalif chairman of the 
house panel investigating hud gilliam said hud officials engaged 
in a grant swap in order to provide 500000 requested in 1985 to 
conduct a feasibility study for a hispanic trade center in kansas 
city mo 
gilliam said that hector barreto then president of the us 
hispanic chamber of commerce sought a hud grant for the project 
but that he first told barreto it was not qualified under secretary 
samuel r pierce jrs discretionary fund for special projects 
he said he got a call that afternoon from deborah gore dean 
assistant to pierce saying barreto had met with bush and that 
she had received a call from the vice presidents staff asking 
about the grant and indicated her desire to try to help get the 
project funded 
as a result gilliam said he persuaded a kansas city assistant 
city manager to provide the grant from the citys community 
development block grant funds provided by hud and that in turn he 
arranged to have a special grant go to kansas city to replace that 
money 
in other words lets make a deal you do this and ill do 
this gilliam said 
he did not name the person in the vice presidents office 
gilliam said he was unclear about the connection to bushs office 
but said dean had indicated something about mr barreto going 
on the vice presidents plane 
lantos before the meeting described the case this way we 
will hear testimony from mr gilliam about special projects how a 
particular project was funded at the request of someone in the 
office of the vice president in order to get a hispanic leader to 
accompany the thenvice president on a plane trip to puerto rico 
once a trusted assistant to pierce during the reagan 
administration gilliam painted a picture of rampant political 
abuse at the agency during his initial appearance before the house 
governmental operations subcommittee on employment and housing 
his second round of testimony involved socalled hud special 
project grants which were made from the secretarys 
discretionary fund 
the program was established to provide aid in cases of natural 
disasters and other unexpected needs without a competitive 
application process subcommittee staff director stuart weisberg 
said before todays hearing that although the money was 
administered at the secretarys discretion political use of the 
fund would constitute an abuse 
discretion does not mean political weisberg said there 
was no intent by congress that it be treated like a political 
action committee to reward political friends 
on monday gilliam disputed pierces assertion before the panel 
last year and in a subsequent magazine interview that he didnt 
decide who got federal grants and was a handsoff administrator 
gilliam said pierce himself ordered federal grants for 
particular projects he said pierce kept notes of which members of 
congress and political friends supported projects which he used 
when funding decisions were made 
his testimony was the first by a top hud insider in more than a 
year of investigation by the panel into allegations of fraud 
influencepeddling and political favoritism at the department 
gilliam pleaded guilty to felony charges of accepting illegal 
gratuities while at hud and conspiring to manipulate a housing 
grant to benefit friends 
pierces attorneys attacked gilliams testimony as motivated by 
a desire for early release from prison attorney paul l perito 
accused lantos subcommittee of an insatiable appetite for 
publicity 
gilliams testimony was not the first time bushs name has 
arisen indirectly in the hud scandal 
a former new york regional official of hud alexander naclerio 
testified last fall that he had been sent by hud officials to visit 
and facilitate funding of a puerto rico project proposed for a 
federal grant and that he understood that its developer delio 
rojo was a prominent backer of bush

a house ways and means subcommittee voted 
wednesday to allow people aged 65 through 69 to earn more money 
without losing any of their social security benefits 
a bill approved by the social security subcommittee also 
includes a provision removing the social security administration 
from the department of health and human services and creating it as 
an independent agency that provision is opposed by the bush 
administration 
the legislation also would require the social security 
administration to improve telephone access to local offices the 
administration cut local telephone service last year preferring to 
rely on a nationwide tollfree number for most beneficiary problems 
the proposed increase in the amount social security recipients 
may earn without losing benefits is considerably less generous than 
taxwriting committees of the house and senate approved last year 
congressional republicans have made outright repeal of the earnings 
limitation a top goal contending it reduces incentives for older 
americans to work 
present law allows a person aged 65 through 69 to earn up to 
9360 this year without penalty each 3 earned above that amount 
reduces social security benefits by 1 
an automatic inflation adjustment built into the law will raise 
the limit to 9960 next year and to 10440 in 1992 the bill 
approved without dissent by the subcommittee would raise the 
figures to 10200 in 1991 and 10920 in 1992 
the bill makes no change in the 6840 earnings limit on people 
under age 65 neither does it affect those 70 or older they could 
continue to earn an unlimited amount without losing any social 
security benefit

leftist guerrillas dynamited 
power stations and attacked strategic targets in the capital early 
today to protest human rights violations they blame on the armed 
forces 
the attacks began shortly before midnight tuesday and faded 
after several hours of predawn fighting the armed forces said it 
suffered five dead and six wounded and that 12 civilians were also 
wounded 
half the city was without electricity and automatic weapons fire 
and explosions ripped through several neighborhoods including the 
wealthy escalon district 
rebels had dynamited five highvoltage utility towers and a 
power plant on nearby san salvador volcano the privately owned 
yskl radio station reported 
there was no fighting in the capital during the morning but 
skirmishing was reported in several areas outside the capital 
including the town of ilobasco 40 miles to the northeast no 
casualty figures were available 
the attacks were a protest of the total immunity that exists 
in this country for members of the armed forces who violate human 
rights the farabundo marti national liberation front guerrillas 
said in a statement sent by fascimile 
the statement cited the stalled investigation and evident 
coverup of the intellectual authors of the crime against the 
jesuits referring to the killings of six jesuit priests at 
central american university in november 
president alfredo cristiani has admitted the six priests 
including the university rector were killed by members of the 
armed forces but critics have said the investigation should go 
farther 
one high officer col guillermo benavides has been charged in 
the killings of the jesuits along with three lieutenants and five 
soldiers 
despite years of deathsquad killings no officer has ever been 
convicted in a human rightsrelated crime 
the house foreign affairs committee voted last week to cut us 
military aid to el salvador in half from 85 million the other 
half would be cut if the government fails to properly investigate 
the jesuit killings or negotiate in good faith with the guerrillas 
the attacks also appeared timed to coincide with the scheduled 
start of preliminary peace talks today 
indirect preliminary talks were to begin today between 
cristianis rightist government and the guerrillas 
a presidential spokesman said a representative of un 
generalsecretary javier perez de cuellar was expected to arrive 
today to act as a gobetween in setting up an agenda and arranging 
other details for the negotiations 
the guerrilla statement said they were still disposed to 
continue with the negotiating process 
the first guerrilla attack on the power line towers began at 
about 10 pm tuesday hours after about 40000 people attended a 
huge may day rally organized by labor unions and opposition parties 
to criticize cristianis economic austerity program and urge peace 
talks 
at the peaceful rally militant leftists joined the moderate 
christian democrats whom cristiani succeeded in one of the largest 
opposition protests in a decade 
guerrillas shot it out with government soldiers near the hotel 
in escalon where americans had been trapped for a time during the 
november offensive and the gunfight spilled over into the tasumal 
neighborhood residents there said 
attempts to negotiate an end to the war ended in deadlock in 
1984 and 1985 and a series of direct talks began shortly after 
cristiani was sworn in as president in july 
they broke off as a result of the monthlong november offensive 
more than 72000 people have been killed most of them 
civilians since the war began in october 1979

someone set former gov evan mechams 
campaign headquarters on fire this morning causing an estimated 
35000 in damage officials said 
its very suspicious the fact that nobody was around when we 
got here its definitely not electrical glendale fire capt 
kevin pool said were calling it arson 
mecham a republican who was removed from office by impeachment 
conviction two years ago said he doubted there was a political 
connection 
i dont think we can draw any conclusions of that kind at 
all mecham said 
it was arson but there has been a couple of houses set on 
fire out here in northwest phoenix he added 
in april 1988 the state senate convicted mecham of obstructing 
an investigation of a death threat against an aide and of loaning 
his auto dealership 80000 from a protocol fund 
his removal from the governorship after less than 1 years in 
office capped one of the stormiest tenures in arizona history he 
is now attempting to make a political comeback 
he said the quick work of firefighters limited interior damage 
although there was heavy damage to the roof of the 
7300squarefoot building his former residence 
investigators said three spots outside the building had been 
blackened indicating three starting points for the fire there was 
no evidence of burglary police said 
a newspaper carrier for the arizona republic spotted smoke near 
the entrance of the structure about 315 am pool said 
firefighters had the blaze under control by 4 am 
the property appraised at about 50000 by a real estate 
information service faces foreclosure unless mecham works out a 
settlement with the federal deposit insurance corp an auction on 
the property is set for may 18 
mecham said he had no idea who would want to burn his 
headquarters which also is home of fazpac a political action 
committee and mp press a publishing arm of mechams campaign 
he called the arson a minor setback and predicted that his sixth 
campaign for governor would rebound he ran unsuccessfully four 
times before winning the office in november 1986

the department of veterans affairs opened the 
door wednesday to independent scrutinity of its effort to determine 
whether there is a link between exposure to agent orange and a 
variety of diseases 
the offer follows years of challenges to the credibility of the 
va centers for disease control and the defense department critics 
have charged the government with ignoring the scientific evidence 
of a connection between exposure and cancers and other diseases 
the offer came during testimony by va deputy secretary anthony 
j principi before a house veterans affairs subcommittee 
principi told the subcommittee on compensation pension and 
insurance that the department would agree to a review by the 
national academy of sciences to having its own panel of outside 
scientific advisers enlarged or to subjecting its work to outside 
review 
two agent orange compensation bills pending in congress call for 
establishment of a scientific review procedure through the national 
academy an independent group of scientists that advises the 
government 
should congress conclude that the process would be lent 
credibility by our consulting with additional outside experts 
we would be pleased to do so if that kind of consultation would not 
unduly delay our progress principi said 
but principi also asked the subcommittee to put off 
consideration of a compensation bill the bill would award 
serviceconnected disability payments to vietnam war veterans who 
contend they suffer due to exposure from one of four kinds of 
cancer or from a skin disease known as chloracne 
the bill would also pave the way to compensation for other 
ailments as the evidence comes in 
principi asked that the law be held in abeyance until the va 
comes up with final regulations oct 1 on who should be compensated 
and for what diseases those regulations depend in part on the 
recommendations of vas advisory committee on environmental 
hazards a 15member panel of scientists and lay persons 
the committee meets later this month 
veterans affairs secretary edward j derwinski has appointed his 
personal adviser on the agent orange issue retired adm elmo 
zumwalt to fill a vacancy on the committee zumwalt ordered 
spraying of agent orange during vietnam and also lost a son who 
served in vietnam to cancer 
we have i believe more than demonstrated our good faith 
principi said saying the va set its course a year ago when it 
decided against appealing a federal judges order that it draft new 
agent orange regulations 
but the house sponsor of the compensation bill rep lane evans 
dill suggested the va was trying to further postpone delivering 
benefits to veterans there is no guarantee the department will 
decide to award compensation in its final rules 
i think you are proceeding on a goodfaith basis but i 
believe the veterans who suffer from agent orange cant wait he 
said 
evans bill would compensate exposed veterans who suffer from 
nonhodgkins lymphoma softtissue sarcoma melanoma and basal 
cell carcinoma as well as chloracne the measure is expected to 
cost 89 million a year 
about 35000 veterans have filed claims asserting a connection 
between exposure to agent orange and a host of ailments only a 
handful of benefits have been granted for those suffering 
chloracne 
dioxin labeled by the environmental protection agency as a 
probable human carcinogen is suspected as the primary but not 
the only ingredient causing ailments among veterans exposed to 
agent orange

for years only a plain iron historical 
marker has stood at the site of the 1832 bad axe massacre where 
hundreds of indian warriors women and children were chased into 
the mississippi river and shot 
now the state facing unrest over relations with the chippewa 
is apologizing to the sac and fox indian nation who according to 
one historian endured one of the bloodiest tragedies in the sad 
history of americanindian relations 
the apology to be issued saturday finally recognizes the 
mistakes of the past said sister toni harris a roman catholic 
nun and member of the indian rights group honor our neighbors 
origins and rights 
if we recognize what was done in the past we make different 
choices for the future ms harris said a failure to 
recognize whether its the holocaust or other kinds of 
abominations of people against people only threatens the 
possibility of repeating those abominations 
honor based in milwaukee urged the legislature last year to 
pass the resolution formally apologizing for the armys action on 
aug 12 1832 
state rep david clarenbach hopes saturdays ceremony in the 
village of victory named by residents years ago to celebrate the 
massacre could set a very important tone for resolving a 
modernday dispute with wisconsins six chippewa indian bands 
the purpose of this kind of reconciliation is to draw strength 
from a new bond that replenishes old distrust said clarenbach 
who sponsored the apology approved by the legislature last october 
tribal leaders from the sac and fox nation in iowa oklahoma and 
kansas have been invited to wisconsin to accept the apology the 
ceremony is planned at the historical marker erected in 1955 
chief elmer manatowa of the sac and fox nation in oklahoma said 
he was pleased with the apology but admitted having second 
third and fourth thoughts about it 
why us why not the present day indian people in wisconsin 
that need the help now he asked referring to the fact that 
members of the sac and fox nation long ago left the state his 
oklahoma band has 2220 members 
to have the state of wisconsin publicly apologize is something 
we look at manatowa said i am going to ask the state of 
wisconsin to do the same thing for the chippewa to do something to 
ease the relationship up there 
headlines about indian relations in wisconsin in recent years 
mostly have focused on hostilities over the chippewas special 
treaty rights to spear fish hunt and cut timber off reservation in 
the northern third of the state 
since 1983 when a court affirmed that the chippewa retained the 
rights under 19th century federal treaties ceding their territory 
chippewa and nonindians have clashed over the tribes right to 
spear fish in spawning season 
last year 200 protesters were arrested at lakes where chippewa 
were fishing 
clarenbach said the states willingness to apologize to the sac 
and fox nation wont solve unrest over chippewa treaty rights but 
it symbolizes the beginning of a new atmosphere of freedom and 
trust 
according to the assembly resolution more than 1000 sac and 
fox indians following the leadership of black hawk were 
attempting to cross the mississippi river at a point that is now 
the southeastern corner of minnesota and restore their villages in 
1832 
the army aided by an armed steamboat set out to stop them 
estimates of how many indians died range from 850 to 1400 
the black axe massacre was one of the bloodiest tragedies in 
the sad history of americanindian relations historian ray allen 
billington wrote in westward expansion a history of the american 
frontier 
manatowa said the apology wont erase his peoples pain over the 
massacre or other injustices but he calls it a first step toward 
bringing future generations of indians and nonindians together 
the people who followed black hawk and didnt make it maybe 
this will help put them to rest he said

orders to factories for manufactured goods 
have rebounded from januarys worst decline in 16 years the 
government said wednesday in a report analysts interpreted as 
another sign the industrial sector is recovering from months of 
weakness 
the commerce department said orders for both durable and 
nondurable goods rose 38 percent in march to a seasonally 
adjusted 2404 billion after advancing 18 percent in february 
and thus recovered from the 55 percent decline in january 
robert g dederick chief economist with the northern trust co 
in chicago said the weakness is behind us and we now have a 
flat slightly upward bias 
i think the worst is over said allen sinai chief economist 
for the boston co the question now is what kind of rebound and 
whether the longterm interest spike over the last month or so 
will abort what appears to be a recovery 
the january drop was the steepest since a 7 percent decline in 
december 1974 the march increase was the largest since a 47 
percent gain in december 1988 
the department said most of the overall march increase was in 
durable goods up 66 percent to 1287 billion after a 24 percent 
increase the previous month 
durable goods bigticket items expected to last more than 
three years have borne the brunt of high interest rates since 
they often are financed through loans 
but most of the durable goods increase was concentrated in the 
transportation category it was up 224 percent to 366 billion 
due in large part to a 632 percent increase in aircraft orders 
transportation orders had risen 101 percent in february 
excluding transportation orders were up 1 percent 
other durable goods categories posting gains were primary 
metals up 73 percent to 117 billion after a 42 percent decline 
in february and nonelectrical machinery up 12 percent to 226 
billion after falling 06 percent in february 
electrical machinery orders on the other hand fell 16 percent 
to 196 billion after rising 28 percent the previous month 
nondurable goods orders also rose up 08 percent to 1117 
billion on top of a 11 percent gain the previous month food and 
chemicals accounted for most of the advance 
in the key category of nondefense capital goods a barometer of 
business investment plans orders advanced 144 percent to 413 
billion after declines of 59 percent in february and 136 percent 
in january 
but defense orders dropped 39 percent to 74 billion after 
jumping 183 percent in february excluding defense orders gained 
4 percent the largest such increase since a similar advance in 
april 1989 
the department also said shipments were up 11 percent to 2368 
billion after gaining 34 percent a month earlier they were the 
first backtoback gains since january 1989 
inventories fell 03 percent to 3719 billion their third 
decline in four months 
inventories are in extremely good shape and that points 
positively dederick said 
inventories are watched closely because if they increase without 
a corresponding gain in new orders production cutbacks could occur 
in the future as factories try to get rid of goods stored on 
shelves and backlots

members of nato not the soviet union 
must decide whether a unified germany should be part of the western 
alliance secretary of state james a baker iii said today 
baker who stopped here briefly on his way to a nato meeting in 
brussels belgium on thursday said however that he was willing to 
consider the soviet position in talks with foreign minister eduard 
a schevardnadze later in the week 
the question whether the unified germany should be a member of 
nato is a question that is properly decided in nato with the 
participation of a united germany baker told reporters on the 
flight from washington 
the fact of the matter is you cant take a decision of that 
nature without having the members of the alliance sitting at the 
table as a party to the decision baker said 
baker said that at a meeting saturday of the four wartime 
allies and the two germanys there will be indeed a very full 
and complete discussion of that issue because that is one of the 
foremost issues right now that separate the alliance from the 
position of the soviet union 
bakers first stop is brussels for separate sessions thursday 
with nato and european community foreign ministers this will give 
the administration a chance to say how fast it wants moves toward 
the political union of western europe to proceed and what the 
alliances future role should be 
britain with some support from denmark and portugal is trying 
to slow the pace being set by france and west germany the united 
states has kept its distance from what is essentially a european 
decision but it intends to keep close ties to its old allies 
shortly after baker departed washington officials of the two 
german states announced tentative agreement on a plan for merging 
their economies settling basic differences over how the nations 
should assess the costs of unification 
todays agreement announced by officials in east berlin sets 
the stage for a full merger of the economies of the two nations on 
july 2 
ahead for baker on friday in bonn is a round of talks on how the 
union of east germany with west germany will affect the security of 
neighboring european nations such as the soviet union and poland 
baker is intent on promoting membership in the north atlantic 
treaty organization for the reunified germany but the soviets are 
uneasy about their former ally east germany slipping into the 
western military camp 
there will be meetings of the big four allies that stopped the 
nazis in world war ii the united states britain france and the 
soviet union and separate talks by baker with soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze 
lithuanias drive for independence and the soviet economic 
blockade of the breakaway republic is high on the agenda 
on capitol hill tuesday baker came under pressure from several 
senators on the cautious stance president bush is taking toward 
moscow last week he withheld economic sanctions while us and 
soviet negotiators in paris completed the framework of a new trade 
agreement 
sens alfonse m damato rny dennis deconcini dariz and 
others urged the administration not to lower us tariffs for 
soviet goods as long as the soviets continue the blockade of 
lithuania 
some of us feel that we are slipping and sliding into most 
favored nation trade status with the soviet union while they 
are still taking aggressive oppressive actions in the baltic 
countries deconcini said 
going beyond lithuania the senator also criticized the 
administration as being too lenient to china which suppressed 
prodemocracy students in 1989 and to iraq which threatened to 
use chemical weapons against israel 
we must not lose our moral compass deconcini told baker 
similarly sen frank r lautenberg dnj said we urge you 
and expect that you will keep the kinds of pressure on the soviet 
union that you can short of totally disrupting a relationship that 
has been developing of recent years 
baker said the administration still hoped for a dialogue between 
soviet and lithuanian leaders over the baltic republics drive for 
independence 
he offered assurances that completion of the outline of a new 
ussoviet trade agreement did not mean bush would recommend to 
congress a oneyear waiver of high us tariffs lower tariffs 
depend also on the soviets completing legislation to permit free 
emigration by its citizens baker said 
he stressed however that the ussoviet relationship ran far 
deeper than problems in the baltics he cited negotiations for 
treaties to sharply reduce soviet tanks and troops in europe and 
the soviet arsenal of longrange nuclear missiles 
besides baker said we want to see a continued approach by 
the soviet union that will permit us to hopefully bring freedom and 
democracy to other areas of the world

tiny exclusive mills college has never 
been where the boys are but a vote by trustees of the 138yearold 
womens school may admit male undergraduates for the first time 
the trustees of northern californias only womens college meet 
privately thursday at an undisclosed location to decide whether to 
go coeducational 101 years after graduating the first women west of 
the mississippi 
students say they feel powerless to affect the boards decision 
although most of the 777 women undergrads at the quiet treelined 
campus in east oakland oppose the plan designed to boost enrollment 
and revenues 
i think the board of trustees is going to vote to go coed no 
matter what we say theyve shown that so far said nina 
schneider a 22yearold art major who will graduate this year 
mills has admitted male graduate students since the 1930s when 
the program began said lindsey beaben a mills spokeswoman who 
noted that schools can lose federal funds if they exclude graduate 
students because of race sex or national origin nearly 20 percent 
of the 264 graduate students are men 
its undergraduate school is one of three in the state and 98 
nationwide that exclude men 
although most students and faculty oppose admitting male 
undergraduates administrators say going coeducational ultimately 
will save the prestigious liberal arts school from a growing 
financial crisis 
of course it will be an unpopular decision it will be a 
heartbreaking decision said the trustees chairman f warren 
hellman whose family members have attended mills and held 
positions on its board for 75 years 
hellman a san francisco investment banker said the college 
must go coed to avoid relying too much on its 70 million 
endowment which provides onefifth of the schools 24 million 
annual budget 
we had a deficit last year and well have a deficit this year 
and the next hellman said its not working any longer i 
dont want to see us eat away at the endowment until were in real 
trouble 
opponents argue that admitting men would violate tradition at 
the institution that began as the young ladies seminary high school 
in benicia before moving 35 miles southeast to oakland as a college 
in 1871 
opponents also contend that letting men into undergraduate 
classrooms could spoil the atmosphere that allows women to take 
leadership roles in discussions and on campus 
theres a sense of empowerment women get from attending this 
college because of the climate in the classroom said robyn 
fisher the 21yearold senior president of the associated students 
at mills 
enrollment in mills colleges 33 undergraduate programs is down 
42 percent from three years ago and 29 percent below the 1000 
students needed to balance the budget peak undergraduate 
enrollment was 810 students in 1987 
frank detoma dean of the faculty said hes not sure if 
trustees will heed last weeks 5726 faculty vote against admitting 
male undergraduates 
many women do demonstrably better in this teaching 
environment said detoma who came to mills in 1989 after 19 
years at allwoman mount holyoke in massachusetts but i 
personally feel going coed will help maintain the liberal arts 
programs at the high standards we have now 
sociology professor ted thomas headed the panel that proposed 
the coed idea after rejecting ideas to attract more women students 
going coed is the least risky option for the future of the 
college said thomas whos been at mills for 26 years there 
are two ways to look at this in a funereal way or as a challenge 
to build upon something that has a great tradition 
even the numbers seem to favor a change only 42 percent of 
california students taking college entrance examinations say they 
want to go to an allfemale college 
and the 11900 tuition which usually increases 8 percent a 
year is 10 times more expensive than the university of 
californias public colleges and universities

president fw de klerk and 
african national congress leader nelson mandela on wednesday urged 
the swift abolition of apartheid and began historic talks aimed at 
ending whiteminority rule 
the three days of meetings are to remove obstacles to fullscale 
negotiations on a new constitution that would give the 28million 
black majority a voice in national affairs for the first time 
de klerk and mandela standing on the lawn of a dutch colonial 
mansion where the talks were held said south africans of all races 
want swift change all political parties must work toward a 
peaceful solution to racial and political divisions they said 
nearby the proapartheid conservative party walked out of a 
debate in parliament to protest the talks the conservative leader 
andries treurnicht said the government should not negotiate with 
an organization that has carried out guerrilla attacks and still 
was committed to armed struggle 
south african law forbids all these actions said 
treurnicht whose party is the main opposition in parliaments 
white chamber the tricameral parliament also has chambers for 
people of mixedrace and indian descent blacks are excluded 
mandela in a statement before the talks began said the pace 
at which we move to arrive at a just solution should be informed by 
the fact that the black masses of our country demand and expect 
fundamental change now and not tomorrow 
the people as a whole want the peace and stability that can 
only come about as a result of the total abolition of the apartheid 
system he said 
but de klerk warned that violence that has claimed more than 500 
lives in the past three months threatens such change much of the 
violence has been among black groups with differing views of a 
future south africa 
the vast majority of south africans desire the negotiation 
process aimed at a new constitution to get started in all 
earnestness de klerk said the government wishes this to 
happen as soon as possible and is consequently approaching the 
talks with the utmost earnestness 
the anc demands the release of all political prisoners lifting 
of the state of emergency and the return of exiled activists as 
preconditions to constitutional negotiations 
the government meanwhile is demanding the anc a guerrilla 
movement renounce its largely dormant armed struggle 
the talks are the first between a white government and an anc 
delegation since the organization was founded in 1912 the 
discussions are being held at the groote schuur estate once the 
official home of south african presidents 
security for the meeting was strict scores of uniformed police 
and plainclothes security agents guarded the house and grounds 
the two sides said they plan to make no further comment on the 
talks until they adjourn friday 
in his statement before the talks began mandela attempted to 
calm white fears about a black government saying whites would 
enjoy full rights in a nonracial democratic state 
he made part of his remarks in afrikaans the language of the 
dutchdescended afrikaners they comprise 3 million of the 
countrys 5 million whites and dominate the government 
mandela the ancs deputy president was released in february 
after 27 years in jail for helping to launch the ancs armed 
struggle he is the de facto leader of the group whose president 
oliver tambo last year suffered a stroke 
mandela called the talks a historic turning point marking the 
end of a servant and master relationship between blacks and 
whites 
south africa he said would never again base its political and 
social systems on racial superiority and segregation 
the idea that the color of a person defines their place in 
society must to all of us be as frightening as the plague he 
said 
mandela also stressed the need to improve the economic 
conditions of millions of blacks who live in desperate poverty 
while whites control most wealth 
the two sides are expected to make progress this week but 
government and anc officials say further preliminary talks may be 
necessary to remove all obstacles to constitutional negotiations 
de klerk has promised to end white rule but he opposes a simple 
oneperson onevote system he says such a system would replace 
white domination with black domination 
the anc says it is committed to a fully democratic system with 
no special rights for any minority the anc also wants a radical 
restructuring of the economy that could include nationalizing 
banks gold mines and other leading industries 
both sides are under pressure from black and white extremists 
who oppose any settlement proapartheid whites want to preserve 
white rule while radical black groups want to end all forms of 
white control and privilege

scientists have found new evidence that a single 
gene of the aids virus promotes an aidsrelated cancer called 
kaposis sarcoma 
the gene tells cells to produce a particular protein and the 
new testtube study found that this protein spurred the growth of 
kaposis sarcoma cells taken from aids patients 
scientists also found that the protein was released by cells 
infected with the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome 
kaposis sarcoma is a generally uncommon cancer that appears 
unusually often in people with aids it can be controlled medically 
and it rarely kills aids patients 
the study focused on a gene called tat which helps regulate 
growth of the aids virus in previous research scientists had 
found that when mice were given a copy of this gene they developed 
a skin disease that closely resembled kaposis sarcoma 
combined with that finding the new work indicates that once the 
genes protein escapes from an aidsinfected cell it may promote 
the development or progression of kaposis sarcoma elsewhere in the 
body researchers wrote in thursdays issue of the british journal 
nature 
the work was reported by dr robert gallo and colleagues at the 
national cancer institute and dr flossie wongstaal of the 
university of california san diego

prime minister yitzhak shamir is emphasizing 
the need for broaderbased negotiations with the arab world in 
place of the palestinianisraeli dialogue promoted by us 
officials 
shamir who appears likely to head israels next government has 
played down the importance of holding talks with palestinians in 
cairo as proposed by us secretary of state james a baker iii 
one should not expect us in israel to always agree with 
everything the americans offer us just as the americans would not 
always agree with our proposals shamir told reporters wednesday 
instead he and others in his caretaker government have 
emphasized that the focus of peacemaking efforts should be shifted 
toward arab states such as iraq syria and libya which pose a 
greater threat to israel than the 28monthold palestinian uprising 
the shift in emphasis appears to have been provoked by iraqi 
president saddam hussein who last month warned he would destroy 
half of israel with binary chemical weapons in response to any 
israeli attack 
i think that something is perhaps understood today that was 
not understood before saddam hussein spoke that the palestinian 
part of the arabisraeli conflict is only one of the parts and not 
the most important one compared to the other parts foreign 
minister moshe arens said on israel tv this week 
in recent months violence has tapered off in the occupied 
lands whereas concern about chemical warfare was brought home to 
every israeli by the armys plan provoked by saddams remarks 
to distribute gas masks nationwide 
in an interview wednesday brig gen nachman shai the army 
spokesman said the danger posed by arab states outweighs that of 
riots in the occupied lands 
people understand now that the argument is not now on the 
west bank it has gone back to square one what is the overall 
solution you cannot settle the nablus riots and be happy 
neither us nor them he said 
he said israels main concern now is radical arab regimes 
what do iraq and syria intend to do to look for the right 
moment to start a war he said 
but moshe maoz a hebrew university middle east expert argued 
that israel should start peace negotiations with the palestinians 
now if it does not want the arab world to unite against israel 
noting the egyptiansyrian summit in damascus and signs of a 
syrianiraqi rapprochement maoz said that for israel to be 
stubborn would reach an opposite goal and strengthen unity in the 
arab world 
sources say shamir also was put off the baker plan because he 
felt the united states encouraged his labor party rival shimon 
peres to provoke the current political crisis 
peres brought down a shamirled coalition march 15 after shamir 
refused to endorse bakers proposals but he failed to put together 
a government opening the door for shamir 
officials of shamirs rightwing likud bloc say shamir will not 
formulate a specific policy until he has assembled a ruling 
coalition and his hard line could be modified if the centerleft 
labor party is included 
shamir has been grumbling for some time that us proposals 
focus only on his offer of palestinian elections and ignore other 
aspects of his fivepoint plan which the government approved may 
14 1989 
the plan called for an end to the state of war with arab states 
aid to resettle palestinians living in crowded refugee camps peace 
with jordan and a statement of principles opposing talks with 
the palestine liberation organization or creation of a palestinian 
state 
we have voted in the cabinet on the five points and i see 
these five points together with our assumptions as one unity 
he told reporters 
but the arab world is unlikely to accept broader negotiations 
except in the context of a unsponsored international conference 
shamir has rejected that idea because he feels the conference would 
be biased against israel 
shamirs refusal to accept the baker approach is seen by many 
palestinians here and by arab leaders abroad as footdragging 
egyptian president hosni mubarak said after a may day speech 
that shamir does not appear to seek peace 
responding wednesday shamir said peace is not something you 
say today and it will happen tomorrow it is a long process

actors from the la law cosby and 
sesame street tv programs gave their support wednesday to a 
bill that would require all standardsized television sets to be 
able to display captions for deaf or hearingimpaired viewers 
witnesses at a house hearing including tv stars richard dysart 
geoffrey owens and linda bove said millions of americans are being 
excluded from access to broadbased communications systems 
particularly tv 
transmitting socalled closed captioning services on most tv 
sets would benefit not only the estimated 24 million americans with 
hearing disabilities but some 18 million youngsters learning to 
read and millions more foreigners and illiterate adults trying to 
learn english 
i think captioning should be a standard feature on the 
television signal thats how important it is said owens a 
costar on nbctvs cosby show 
a tv manufacturers representative however said it would be 
unfair to require that everyone particularly the poor or 
lowincome senior citizens be required to bear the costs of sets 
with closedcaptioning capability 
the bill by rep major owens dny and a companion measure by 
sen tom harkin diowa would require all sets with screens 13 
inches or larger be able to display captions cost of such 
circuitry has been estimated at 15 to 20 
making such circuitry mandatory amounts to a regressive excise 
tax on all purchasers of television sets in order to benefit a 
small albeit deserving minority said thomas p friel a vice 
president with the electronic industries association 
he urged the house energy and commerce subcommittee on 
telecommunications and finance to require that only some tv sets be 
capable of closedcaptioning 
beginning with the 1989 season abc cbs and nbc were offering 
closedcaptioning on all their primetime programs noted 
subcommittee chairman rep edward markey dmass but witnesses 
said most local and syndicated programs are not closedcaptioned 
and that only 90 of some 1500 local news broadcasts are 
closedcaptioned 
its a cost decision said i king jordan president of the 
gallaudet university school for the hearing impaired he said he 
feared the major television networks would stop offering 
closedcaptioning unless a way was found to enlarge the audience 
for such services 
he said the government already has spent 45 million on 
closedcaptioning since the late 1970s and the closedcaptioning 
bill would ensure that this money will not have been wasted 
dysart who is costar of nbctvs la law and 1990 
chairman of the council for better hearing and speech month 
dismissed the economic arguments he said the prices for the 
closedcaptioning circuitry would drop dramatically when all sets 
had the closedcaptioning circuitry 
dysart said most people cannot afford to buy settop devices 
that currently provide closedcaptioning only about 300000 of the 
settop decoders are in use primarily because of the 160 to 200 
perunit cost he said 
bove of the sesame street childrens show said captioning 
was very important in helping children with normal hearing learn to 
read she said it cost between 1500 and 2000 to caption a 
30minute tv program

lithuanias president said wednesday his baltic 
republic would consider suspending temporarily some of the 
proindependence laws that drove the kremlin to impose an economic 
embargo two weeks ago 
president vytautas landsbergis agreed to the step in a letter to 
french and west german leaders who last week proposed that such a 
compromise would help start negotiations between the republic and 
moscow 
everything is negotiable which does not question the matter of 
restored independence of the lithuanian state on march 11 1990 
landsbergis said in his letter to french president francois 
mitterrand and west german chancellor helmut kohl 
the letter was read to lithuanias parliament the supreme 
council which gave its approval without a vote said aidas 
palubinskas a spokesman for the parliament 
putting our confidence in france and the federal republic of 
germany as well as in other western democracies and in their 
support of lithuanian democracy we are asking you to transmit to 
the soviet authorities our consent to consider a temporary 
suspension of the effects of the decisions taken by the sovereign 
parliament of the lithuanian republic that could trouble the soviet 
authorities landsbergis wrote 
the idea behind the proposal from france and west germany was 
that if lithuania temporarily suspended those laws the soviet 
union in return might ease its pressure on the republic and also 
agree to talks on secession 
palubinskas stressed that the proposal from kohl and mitterrand 
did not ask for rescinding the declaration itself but urged the 
suspension of laws passed to implement the independence declaration 
lithuania declared independence on march 11 trying to restore 
the freedom it enjoyed before 1940 when the soviet union forcibly 
annexed it along with latvia and estonia it has since passed laws 
designed to back the independence drive including ending 
conscription of lithuanians into the soviet army issuing identity 
cards for nonlithuanians and seizing communist party property 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has declared the 
independence declaration invalid and rejected negotiations with the 
republic saying such talks are reserved for foreign countries he 
demanded that lithuania rescind those proindependence laws 
gorbachev imposed a partial economic blockade cutting supplies 
of fuel and other commodities to lithuania as of wednesday night 
no resumption of any of the fuel supplies has been reported 
the republic of 38 million people has been struggling 
economically ever since the embargo was imposed 
at least 10000 people have been thrown out of work due to 
factory closures palubinskas said with that number expected to 
increase to 35000 by the end of the week rationing of gasoline 
and food has begun and medicine is in short supply in some 
hospitals 
soviet officials have welcomed the frenchgerman proposal 
contained in a letter to landsbergis and gorbachev gorbachevs 
spokesman arkady maslennikov told a briefing in moscow on 
saturday that the letter is not far from the line that the soviet 
leadership has been pursuing 
the republics prime minister kazimiera prunskiene is 
scheduled to meet thursday with president bush in washington bush 
has urged the lithuanians and soviets to negotiate their dispute 
but has refused to impose sanctions on the kremlin or recognize the 
republics independence 
we hope that mrs prunskiene will more completely inform 
president bush about the situation in lithuania in the days of 
blockade landsbergis told parliament wednesday according to 
eduardas potashinskas of lithuanian television 
in another development the independent news service postfactum 
in moscow reported lithuania is trying to revive oil wells to help 
make up for the april 18 cutoff of oil supplies by the kremlin 
interfax a news service affiliated with moscow radio said the 
wells would be able to produce only enough oil for agricultural 
needs 
lithuanians are rebuilding facilities at the port of klaipeda to 
allow it to receive imported oil later this month interfax said 
it did not say who would supply the oil which would have to be 
bought with foreign currency that lithuania lacks 
wednesday was the first workday in lithuania under the food 
rationing system most stores were closed tuesday when the system 
went into effect because of the may day holiday 
daina kalendra a worker at the supreme councils information 
office said that for may and june each person is limited to the 
following sugar 44 pounds macaroni 22 pounds grains 44 
pounds salt 22 pounds flour 44 pounds grease or margarine 
about a halfpound 
lithuania supplies most of its own meat and dairy needs 
the crisis threatened to expand to latvia on thursday when that 
republics parliament will convene to consider declaring its 
independence 
unlike lithuania where native lithuanians make up 80 percent of 
the population native residents make up about 54 percent of 
latvias 27 million residents with the rest largely russians who 
frown on the idea of secession 
despite their ethnic disadvantage latvian nationalists have 
been pushing for the parliament to emulate lithuania

a gunman ambushed and killed a bicycle 
rider seriously injured a driver and wounded two police officers 
before he was shot in a sidewalk gunbattle outside a crowded 
shopping mall police said 
paul bellazain was wounded in the thigh tuesday during a 
shootout with officers near the westlake mall in daly city just 
south of san francisco said daly city police detective jim mchenry 
one of the officers tackled bellazain who carried a pistol as 
he tried to flee ending a 45minute rampage in which a gunman in a 
brown cadillac cruised a freeway and side streets in san francisco 
fatally shooting the bicyclist and firing at cars 
daly city police said bellazain would be booked for 
investigation of two counts of attempted murder san francisco 
police said bellazain was under investigation in connection with 
the shootings here bellazain 46 was in fair condition tuesday 
night at kaiser hospital 
bellazain a veteran san francisco transit driver has been off 
work the past five months receiving workers compensation because 
of a hand injury 
the shooting spree apparently began in san francisco shortly 
before 9 am when officers received reports of shots fired on 
alemany boulevard said police spokesman dave ambrose 
a short time later james newman was struck by a bullet that 
entered his arm and lodged in his chest as he was driving on i280 
in san francisco newman 41 was in serious condition tuesday 
night at san francisco general hospital 
at 910 am police received a call that a bike rider was shot 
to death at mclaren park near the daly city border he was 
identified by the coroners office today as james vaszko 43 a 
copy editor at the san francisco examiner 
everyone here was just shocked said larry kramer executive 
editor of the examiner he was just one of those really nice 
intellectual type of guys he was a sweetheart 
the gunman apparently continued south into daly city where 
between 910 am and 935 am chiropractor gene martin and his 
receptionist stephanie ryan were taken hostage in their office 
he said get over there doc and then he started to rant 
and rave how the system was messing him up a shaken martin said 
he had three guns when he came in and he said he was sorry he 
didnt have an uzi martin said i thought i was going to die 
but he was really after the cops 
bellazain gave martin tapes containing what he said were 
messages to his children proclaiming his love for them he told the 
hostages he wanted to get back at police because they were 
reportedly investigating him for alleged child abuse 
san francisco and daly city police said they knew of no such 
investigation but bellazain had been under a restraining order 
sought by his exwife shirley ann bellazain who said he abused 
her and their children during their 17year marriage 
the gunman let the receptionist go after she lied saying she 
was pregnant according to martin he said bellazain told him to 
call police before storming out of the office to confront officers 
with a volley of shots 
it seemed like the shooting went on forever said alfredo 
aguirre manager of the san mateo county mental health clinic near 
the shopping center where horrified shoppers witnessed the 
gunbattle 
two officers sgt ralph warren and gary smith were each shot 
in the arm during the gunbattle police said it was not clear who 
shot bellazain

merging their economies wednesday after west germany agreed to give 
elderly east germans more financial protection from the throes of 
the free market 
the tentative agreement which still has to be approved by the 
parliaments of both countries settles major differences between 
the two germanys over how to assess the high costs of unification 
it clears the way for a full merger of their economies by july 
2 when the west german mark will become the official currency of 
east germany 
in a major compromise west germany said it would allow senior 
citizens in east germany to convert more of their savings at a 
favorable 11 rate to the west german mark 
the plan comes just three days before a meeting between the two 
germanys and the four world war ii allies that divided germany 
the soviet union united states britain and france to discuss 
the international ramifications of german unity 
us secretary of state james a baker iii was to join foreign 
ministers from the other countries for the historic 
fourplustwo talks in bonn the west german capital 
a full political merger of the two germanys is expected next 
year but first some thorny issues must be resolved including 
membership of a unified germany in nato and new european security 
arrangements 
the economic merger agreement was confirmed wednesday by mathias 
gehler spokesman for east german prime minister lothar de 
maiziere and rudolf seiters chief of staff for west german 
chancellor helmut kohl 
i want to emphasize that what the germanys have agreed upon 
is tied with the responsibility of the economic and social 
developments in both parts of germany and the stability of the 
west german mark seiters said in a statement in bonn 
the two germanys have been negotiating for weeks over how west 
germany can absorb the crippled east german economy without 
threatening the strength of the powerful west german mark 
the east german mark is officially valued at 31 against the 
west german mark but is virtually worthless outside the country 
however east german officials said they needed a nearequal 
conversion rate to make up for removing subsidies which kept down 
prices under the former socialist system 
under the agreement all salaries earned by east germans would 
be converted at a 11 rate the agreement also will allow east 
germans to obtain ownernship shares in stateowned enterprises 
the plan also provides that people aged 60 and older will be 
able to convert up to 3350 in personal savings at the 11 rate 
while east germans 14 and under would be able to convert only up to 
1180 dollars 
everyone else would be able to convert 2300 at the 11 rate 
any savings above the ceiling levels would be changed at a 21 rate 
west germany originally had proposed a 2300 ceiling for all 
germans but east germany demanded a higher limit 
the bundesbank west germanys central bank had advocated a 21 
conversion rate warning that a 11 rate would cost the west german 
economy billions of dollars 
pensioners will receive the most protection under the plan 
elderly east germans will have their monthly pensions raised to 
west german levels when the economies are merged 
west germany also has agreed to allow some stillundefined 
financial protection for students and renters who may not be able 
to afford rents once they are set by the free market 
several protests have been held in recent weeks by east germans 
demanding protection from unemployment and competition from western 
businesses 
east germans who still will earn only about onethird of their 
west german counterparts also fear rising prices when the nations 
are united 
west germans meanwhile fear that absorbing the east german 
economy will dilute the power of the mighty west german currency 
and lead to higher taxes and inflation

seized by mexican agents and his crew members were beaten and 
jailed in retaliation for the alleged us kidnapping of a mexican 
physician accused of murder

camarena a dea agent 
this is just retaliation for the alvarez arrest said 
olenicoff who was not on board when the yacht was seized he said 
the mexican agents told his captain you have one of ours now we 
have yours 
on wednesday dea chief terrence m burke denied that his agents 
played a role in the abduction of alvarez we did not have any 
agent actively participate in the planning and execution of the 
operation burke told a senate hearing in washington dc 
state department spokeswoman frances jones said the mexican 
government insists it seized the 2 million 83foot yacht because 
it was carrying illegal guns and had two crew members who did not 
have visas 
jorge reyes a spokesman for the mexican embassy in washington 
said he could not comment because his office knows nothing about 
the incident 
ambrosius and his wife tammy gave this account of the seizure 
he was hired as captain of the yacht in february when the 
vessel was in panama midway through a cruise from california to 
fort lauderdale 
on april 20 the ship landed in cozumel and notified mexican 
customs he said 
two crew members polo herrera of panama and eddie tovar of 
colombia had problems because they did not have visas but mexican 
officials said the problem could be cleared up easily according to 
ambrosius 
the next day about 15 men who said they were mexican drug 
agents but had no identification or uniforms boarded the ship and 
found guns used for skeet shooting ambrosius said he should have 
declared the guns 
on april 22 he said the ship was searched for drugs and 
contraband by the mexican navy 
on april 23 the selfdescribed drug agents returned ambrosius 
said he heard them beat one of his crew members 
the agents told him his ship had been seized and they arrested 
herrera and tovar who he said are still in jail the boat remained 
anchored off the coast that day and night watched by patrol boats 
ambrosius said 
early the next day the patrol boats returned to port and 
ambrosius and his wife weighed anchor and drifted away for a 
halfhour before starting the engine 
he said 15foot seas kept the patrol boats from following 
later off the coast of cuba he noticed boats on radar that 
were mirroring his every move the boats were closing in out 
there in the middle of nowhere he said 
ambrosius said he made a sharp turn between two boats and 
briefly moved into cuban waters he then made it safely to key west 
coast guard officials in key west said they believed ambrosius 
story but did not see any mexican patrol boats

parliament made a firm departure from 
its communist past wednesday choosing as hungarys interim 
president a writer jailed for his role in the 1956 antisoviet 
revolt 
arpad goencz 68 replaced matyas szueroes a member of the 
socialist party formerly the communist party which ruled for 42 
years he received 339 of the 370 valid votes cast by secret ballot 
goenczs nomination was the result of a pact between the two 
largest rivals the centerright hungarian democratic forum which 
will most likely form the new government and the liberal league of 
free democrats 
his first deputy gyoergy szabad 66 a founding member of the 
democratic forum became acting speaker of the new freely elected 
parliament goencz is officially speaker but will act as head of 
state until a new president is elected 
goencz a trained lawyer who entered politics after world war ii 
as a member of the thendominant smallholders party has headed 
the hungarian writers union since last december 
he spent six years in prison on a life sentence for his role in 
the 1956 revolt before winning a reprieve in a 1963 general amnesty 
during wednesdays session historic figures from the last 
freely elected parliament before the communists took power were 
called to the podium the session also declared the 1956 uprising a 
revolution and a battle for freedom 
the democratic forum and the free democrats agreed that the 
permanent president should be elected by parliament rather than in 
a direct popular vote goencz appeared likely to get that post 
which in hungary is largely ceremonial 
forum leader jozsef antall said the presidential election could 
happen by early june if the necessary constitutional amendments are 
passed and the government is formed 
he said he expects the new government to be formed by midmay 
the forum is the largest party with 164 seats the smallholders 
and christian democrats have 44 and 21 respectively 
the government of socialist miklos nemeth formally submitted its 
resignation wednesday but will continue as a caretaker government 
until the new cabinet is formed 
in a speech nemeth noted hungarys gradual transition to 
democracy which unlike that of other east bloc countries was led 
by the ruling party 
many think we committed political suicide and in return 
for dismantling the partystate we were pushed from power nemeth 
said referring to his socialist partys poor showing at the polls 
the socialists won only 33 seats in the new parliament 
goencz was expected to ask antall to form a new government when 
parliament resumes on thursday 
wednesdays session was 10 deputies short of a full house eight 
seats set aside for minority representatives have yet to be filled 
exactly one year ago hungary began dismantling its borders 
sparking an exodus of east german refugees to the west that exodus 
precipitated the fall of communism in east germany and later the 
rest of the east bloc 
we must be proud that our country was the pioneer in all the 
changes of eastern europe szueroes said in a farewell address 
dictatorships have been removed walls have fallen and become 
pieces in museums 
among those who listened as a guest was otto von habsburg the 
former crown prince of hungary and a member of the european 
parliament 
the house also formally declared it would join the european 
parliament 
in another symbolic gesture of hungarys return to democracy 
the old communist coat of arms that had adorned the ornate 
parliament chamber was removed

a team of psychologists and social workers 
wednesday counseled and consoled classmates of a senior who 
committed suicide by driving his motorcycle into the side of his 
high school 
dolores bohen spokeswoman for the fairfax county public 
schools said a counseling crisis team also was sent to edison high 
school in franconia where jerry minnick was a student last year 
we are trying to keep as much structure in the routine as 
possible ms bohen said at the same time we are providing 
everyone an opportunity to break away from the routine and sit in 
on counseling sessions 
while classes were in session tuesday at hayfield high minnick 
took his motorcycle on the school running track removed his helmet 
and raced fullspeed into the outside wall of the boys locker 
room he died instantly 
county police spokesman michael proffitt would not estimate how 
fast the 18yearold minnicks motorcycle was traveling when it 
slammed into the brick wall 
in sheridan ark officials put counselors on 24hour call as 
grieving teenagers tried to cope with the apparent suicides of 
three classmates in two days including one who killed himself in 
class after declaring his love for a girl 
ms bohen said minnicks suicide was the first on school grounds 
in the 130000student school system 
because he was killed instantly police had to conduct the 
investigation there on the spot before the body was removed the 
school remained the focal point which was tough she said 
proffitt said minnick was distraught over personal problems 
but he refused to elaborate or say whether minnick left a note he 
did not know when tests would deterine whether minnick died under 
the influence of alcohol or drugs 
natasha reid 17 a hayfield senior said minnick had been in a 
car accident in front of the school about a month ago and a 
motorcycle accident earlier in the year she said he had not 
attended classes much lately 
arthur sullivan whose son chris was a friend of minnick said 
minnick apparently gave no outward sign monday night that he was 
about to take his life 
all his friends were talking to him and he was fine 
sullivan said its difficult to know what personal problem might 
have been ticking over 
school officials said minnicks parents are dead and for the 
past year he lived in the foster home of air force lt col edward 
seward who declined to comment

a former fbi agent said wednesday the 
reputation he established during the investigation that ousted gov 
ray blanton was one reason he defeated nashvilles indicted 
incumbent sheriff 
hank hillin received three votes to every one for incumbent 
sheriff fate thomas who faces a 38count indictment alleging he 
used his office to funnel 500000 in goods and services to himself 
the sheriffs race was one of four tuesday in which incumbents 
and appointed officials were ousted by newcomers 
i think it was just a feeling that the community was fed up 
with machine politics hillin said 
circuit judge harry lester who was defeated by lawyer marietta 
shipley said it seemed voters were picking on anyone in office 
it was just throw em out and they did it in a big way 
lester said 
thomas in office for 18 years said tuesday night after 
conceding defeat im sorry we didnt win maybe i didnt work 
hard enough 
thomas was known for a political organization that was effective 
in getting out the vote and for his grassroots barbecues voter 
mailing lists and ability to raise funds for himself and other 
candidates 
hillin led the investigation into the socalled clemency for 
cash scandal of the late 1970s although blanton who was 
governor from 1975 to 1979 was never convicted on charges that 
state prison inmates could buy their freedom two of his aides were 
sent to prison 
hillin also aided the later investigation that resulted in 
blanton spending two years in federal prison for a 1981 conviction 
on mail fraud extortion and conspiracy charges resulting from a 
scheme to sell liquor licenses the internal revenue service led 
that investigation hillin said 
blantons mail fraud conviction was thrown out on a legal 
technicalityafter he was released from prison he has appealed the 
other convictions 
i had a background of spending five years investigating the 
blanton administration political corruption is so difficult to 
ferret out a long and hard paper trail to follow i think that did 
establish me hillin said 
the office of metro davidson county sheriff in the consolidated 
countycity government is not an investigative law enforcement 
post the sheriffs major role is running the county jail and 
workhouse the metro nashville police department handles law 
enforcement and investigative functions 
unofficial democratic primary vote totals showed hillin winning 
with a count of 64023 votes or 71 percent to thomas 22304 or 
25 percent 
hillin now faces davidson county republican party chairman doug 
reynolds and two independent candidates in the aug 2 election 
thomas faces trial this summer on a federal indictment charging 
him and six other department employees with a violations ranging 
from racketeering and mail fraud to obstruction of justice and tax 
fraud

us trade representative carla hills tried 
wednesday to impart a sense of urgency to stalled trade talks by 
predicting gravely diminished prosperity for all if 
negotiations fail 
hills warning came at the start of three days of negotiations 
with trade ministers from japan the 12nation european community 
and canada 
the officials gathered at a resort north of here to search for 
ways to break an impasse in a fouryear effort to overhaul the 
rules governing the world trading system 
the talks involving almost 100 nations are designed to lower a 
variety of barriers to trade in agriculture textiles and other 
manufactured goods and services such as banking and investment 
the positions of opposing parties have become so entrenched that 
many fear failure for the talks being held under the auspices of 
the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
such an outcome would deal a blow to the administrations hopes 
for expanding export opportunities for us farmers and businesses 
as a way of whittling down americas huge trade deficit which has 
topped 100 billion for six years 
hills speaking to a group of business writers before the talks 
opened called the negotiations the last best chance this 
century to create the trading rules we so sorely need for the next 
century 
calling 1990 a pivotal year for the world economy hills 
painted failure of the talks in stark terms of diminished living 
standards for both industrial and developing countries 
down one path lie open markets expanded trade economic 
growth and prosperity down the other lie closed markets nations 
turned inward and gravely diminished prosperity for all 
hills said she hoped the discussions being held in a wine 
country resort in napa would provide enough guidance so that 
lowerlevel negotiators will be able to reach preliminary agreement 
in at least some of the 15 broad areas under discussion at a july 
23 session in geneva switzerland 
it is expected the talks will be high on the agenda when 
president bush is host for the sevennation economic summit this 
summer in houston 
a chief aim of the united states is an elimination of all 
tradedistorting agricultural subsidies hills estimated that 
ending the costly subsidies could boost us farm exports by 11 
billion annually equal to an extra 3400 for every american 
farmer 
however the european community is fighting efforts to reform 
the subsidy program that is politically popular with european farm 
groups 
the united states has encountered resistance among third world 
countries to its demands for strengthened rules to prevent patent 
and copyright piracy which costs us businesses an estimated 60 
billion annually 
third world nations led by india are fighting a us proposal 
to expand the gatt marketopening rules to cover trade in services 
such as banking investment and insurance 
us companies excel in the service field where 90 percent of 
new american jobs are being created developing countries fear 
their infant service businesses would be no match for huge 
multinational companies 
developing nations are pushing for the gatt talks to scrap trade 
barriers for textile products but the united states bowing to 
pressure from american textile groups wants a less comprehensive 
phasedown of existing textile tariffs and quotas 
the current gatt trade talks launched in uruguay in 1986 are 
scheduled to conclude in brussels on dec 37 
hills told members of the society of american business editors 
and writers that she hoped the obstacles will be resolved by 
december and that a comprehensive agreement can be presented to 
congress next year 
i am an optimist i couldnt hold this job unless i was she

leaders of the prodemocracy movement now 
governing this himalayan kingdom said wednesday that a new 
constitution soon to be drafted would sharply reduce the kings 
power 
prime minister krishna prasad bhattarai criticized the near 
absolute power wielded by the monarchy for the past 29 years under 
the partyless system of government known as the panchayat 
bhattarai told a meeting organized by the nepali journalists 
association that the proposed constitutional reforms would review 
the powers of the king and the active role the king has played 
the meeting was called to honor journalists jailed during the 
recent sevenweek campaign to restore multiparty democracy the 
protests forced king birendra to lift a 29year ban on political 
parties last month and turn over the government to an interim 
coalition made up of prodemocracy forces 
bhattarai whose centrist nepali congress party is the largest 
group in the new coalition government said the active role given 
to the king during the panchayat system was not appropriate 
ganesh man singh the head of the nepali congress party 
indicated that the kings role would be reduced to that of a 
constitutional monarch 
the king will have to remain under the constitution singh 
told the journalists meeting we will not allow him to go either 
an inch above or an inch below the constitution 
bhattarai said the new governments main priorities are to draft 
a new constitution and prepare for free elections that will be held 
within a year 
he said a constitution drafting committee would be set up soon 
and would be expected to complete its work within three months 
in his other remarks bhattarai reported progress in efforts to 
resolve a trade and transit dispute with india 
he said indian prime minister vp singh had expressed his 
willingness to settle the dispute as soon as possible during a 
meeting in new delhi with nepals finance minister devendra raj 
pandey 
pandey was in the indian capital to attend the annual meeting of 
the asian development bank 
india has closed all but two of the 15 crossing points along its 
border with landlocked nepal since march when a trade and transit 
treaty expired the move has caused a sharp increase in nepal in 
the price of essential imports including gasoline and medicine 
so far negotiations between the two countries on a renewal or 
new treaty have been unsuccessful 
bhattarais coalition government which also includes members of 
a leftist coalition independents and two birendra appointees took 
power april 19 
that ended the nearly three decadeslong hold on power by the 
monarchy under the panchayat system which was introduced by 
birendras father king mahendra 
the partyless system was imposed in december 1960 after mahendra 
dismissed the democratically elected nepali congress party 
government accusing it of corruption and poor administration 
the recent prodemocracy campaign climaxed on april 6 when 
police fired at prodemocracy demonstrators marching on the royal 
palace in katmandu witnesses said at least 200 people were killed 
but birendras government maintained that only 10 people were 
killed in the entire country on that day 
the public outcry of the shooting forced birendra to restore 
multiparty democracy

ship lovers on wednesday feared the ss milwaukee 
clipper would ride its last wave into a junk heap sold for scrap 
instead the 85yearold landmark steamer is headed for a new dock 
at an auction in us district court officials of hammond 
inds port authority outbid their only other competitor buying 
the former grande dame of great lake ferries for 335000 
the ss clipper had fallen on hard financial times ousted first 
from chicagos navy pier over a rent dispute then from its mooring 
on the chicago river in recent times it has languished at a dock 
on lake michigan in downtown chicago 
creditors were knocking on the door of its former owner james 
gillon the 361foot ship was subject to a maritime mortgage lien 
and by mutual agreement of owner and creditors was turned over to 
federal authorities in february for sale said attorney alan amos 
who helped in the auction 
wednesdays auction conducted by us marshals required a 
minimum of 100000 for the ship which has been designated a 
national historic landmark and boasts one of the few remaining 
quadruple expansion steam engines 
six bidders submitted the required 25000 deposit to take part 
in the auction but only hammond and one other group specialty 
restaurants inc which wanted to turn the ship into a floating 
nightclub vyed for the vessel 
robert kenney chairman of the hammond port authority said the 
ship would anchor a new yacht harbor being developed in the 
northwestern indiana city once transported from chicago the 
clipper will be revamped to accommodate a restaurant and pavillion 
for the harbor kenney said 
the ss clipper has made its home in the great lakes since its 
construction in 1905 in cleveland 
the ship which carried 900 passengers and 120 automobiles was 
first used as an excursion liner between buffalo ny and duluth 
minn said thatcher waller collections manager at the chicago 
maritime society which runs a small maritime museum 
it was restored in 1940 and during the summer would carry 
passengers and their cars between different lake michigan 
destinations 
this was a liner that went out for a crossing of six hours it 
had state rooms on board the whole bid said waller 
during winter when tourist use slacked off the ship was 
enlisted to carry new cars from detroit to cities on lake 
michigans southern shore he said 
the ship was taken out of service in 1970 and moved to chicago 
by its former owner gillon who began a second restoration gillon 
hoped eventually to sail it again said waller who worked on the 
restoration 
but the coast guard sought massive work before the ship could be 
declared ready to steam and gillon eventually settled for using 
the ship as a floating banquet hall before financial problems led 
it onto the auction block 
several scrappers inquired about buying the clipper for junk 
but the steamer instead will soon be towed by another ship to 
hammond said kenney 
i dont think chicago was really ever aware of the gem that it 
had waller said people need an awareness of their history

banned and vilified by white 
leaders the african national congress has achieved a goal sought 
throughout its 78year history talks with the government on ending 
white domination 
the anc south africas most powerful opposition group began 
meeting with the government wednesday to clear the way for 
negotiations on a constitution that will give the voteless black 
majority a voice in government 
even before the talks began anc leaders described the meeting 
as a triumph for the organization founded in 1912 to fight for 
black political rights 
it is a new lease of life said anc leader reg september 
who returned to south africa last week after 27 years in exile 
we will take full advantage of this and move forward to a new 
south africa 
in this divided country the anc and its close ally the united 
democratic front are the largest political organizations with a 
multiracial leadership 
the ancs rankandfile is overwhelmingly black and male but 
the 11person delegation meeting with the government is comprised 
of six black men two black women two white men and an indian man 
the government side is made up exclusively of male afrikaners 
descendents of dutch who account for 3 million of the countrys 5 
million whites 
the anc has millions of black supporters in south africa and an 
estimated 15000 members in exile many exiles are expected to 
return this year and most observers believe the group would win 
elections if the countrys 28 million blacks were allowed to vote 
several anc rallies have attracted crowds of more than 100000 
people since february when president fw de klerk legalized the 
organization after a 30year ban and freed nelson mandela after 27 
years in prison 
before de klerk assumed power last august government officials 
frequently denounced the anc as a communistinspired terrorist 
group that would be barred from any negotiations 
but de klerk has initiated reforms saying he wants to negotiate 
an end to apartheid which has allowed the white minority to 
maintain political and economic control over blacks 
however he opposes the outright black majority rule favored by 
the anc and other antiapartheid groups 
throughout its history the anc has been led by older 
welleducated blacks who have sought a negotiated solution to the 
countrys race and political conflicts 
albert lutuli anc president in the 1950s and winner of the 
nobel peace prize repeatedly wrote to white leaders requesting a 
meeting the government never consented instead outlawing the 
thenpeaceful anc in 1960 
a year later mandela a lawyer helped launch the ancs 
guerrilla campaign saying it was the only way to oppose apartheid 
most of the leadership was soon arrested or went into exile and 
headquarters were established in lusaka zambia 
the armed struggle which the anc still embraces has never 
posed a serious threat to the government but it has won the 
support of black youths who have received their political education 
in street clashes with security forces 
one of the ancs biggest challenges will be to maintain control 
of its young supporters as the antiapartheid movement moves from 
confrontation to negotiation 
during nationwide unrest in the mid1980s the anc publicly 
stated that it wanted to make south africa ungovernable 
now mandela and other anc leaders are sending mixed signals 
urging supporters to be peaceful and disciplined but saying the 
armed struggle should continue 
in the southeastern province of natal fighting between anc 
supporters and inkatha a relatively conservative zulu group has 
claimed 4000 black lives since 1986 the conflict has intensified 
in recent months despite pleas for peace by both factions and the 
government 
the government has urged the anc to formally suspend its largely 
dormant armed struggle but should the anc do so it would risk 
losing young supporters to more militant groups such as the pan 
africanist congress

smirnoff the vodka of czars that was 
banished during the bolshevik revolution is going back to the 
ussr as the distillation of all that is chic and fashionable 
about america what a country 
from a lifestyle point of view russians look to smirnoff as 
an american symbol which in a way is ironic said vivian brooks 
public relations director for heublein inc which distills the 
russianborn spirit 
heublein the farmingtonbased liquor and wine company is 
taking advantage of easing eastwest trade restraints to ship 
smirnoff back to the soviet union where it was first distilled in 
moscow in 1818 by peter smirnoff 
its not like shipping coals to newcastle brooks said smirnoff 
will be marketed to compete with hundreds of vodka brands in the 
soviet union 
smirnoff has really reached the point where it represents all 
that is chic and fashionable about america brooks said 
smirnoffs were official suppliers of vodka and liqueurs to the 
imperial court until the family business was seized by the red army 
in 1917 and proprietor vladimir smirnoff was jailed under a 
sentence of death 
freed by the white army vladimir escaped to france and sold the 
family formula to fellow emigre rudolph kunett who made his way to 
the united states set up his distillery in bethel and sold out to 
heublein in 1939

american inventor philo t farnsworth a 
pioneer of television was accorded what many believe was long 
overdue glory wednesday when a 7foot bronze likeness of the 
electronics genius was dedicated in the us capitol 
with his 81yearold widow elma farnsworth looking on the 
inventor was extolled as the father of television and his statue 
was placed in the pantheon of famous americans of the capitols 
national statuary hall 
i think its an honor long overdue said bruce barnson who 
headed a commission that raised 250000 to place farnsworth near 
the likeness of a betterknown utahn brigham young 
i want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for 
this great honor mrs farnsworth told an audience at the capitol 
dedication 
the ceremony included songs from the school choir from 
ridgecrest elementary school in butler utah students from 
ridgecrest started the drive for the statue after they surveyed 
utah residents and recommended to the state legislature that 
farnsworth be the second utahn honored in statuary hall 
the statue by utah sculptor james avanti depicts farnsworth 
holding an image dissector tube that was the heart of the 
electronic television system that he first conceived as a 
15yearold high school student in 1922 
farnsworth is called in an inscription at on the base of the 
statue the father of television 
farnsworth gained the first patent on his system the precursor 
of todays television in 1934 after winning a patent battle with 
the powerful rca corporation which later paid him 1 million to 
use his many patents most history books list farnsworth only as 
one of many early pioneers of television 
he died in 1971 while working on fusion research he had 
contributed more than 160 inventions including radar and the 
electron microscope he was named to the national inventors hall of 
fame in 1984 
each state is allowed to honor two of its famous citizens with 
statues in statuary hall but utah had placed only young in the 
hall

an error by a ground controller put the hubble 
space telescope to sleep again overnight but the 15 billion 
instrument was reawakened wednesday and was functioning normally 
again 
it was the third time since the telescope was put into open 
space april 25 that its electronics were powered down to prevent 
damage 
nasa said the controller at the goddard space flight center 
failed to send a signal telling the telescopes lens cover not to 
close during a testing operation the 10foot diameter cover shut 
and its motion caused the telescope to go into a safemode 
the spacecraft operated just as it should have the space 
agency said in a statement the problem was caused by ground 
controller oversight 
in the safemode the telescope automatically maintains its 
position points its solar arrays to the sun to receive power and 
activates other functions to protect the spacecraft 
the system is designed to safeguard the telescope for 72 hours 
without ground control 
it happened the first time on friday when engineers sent 
commands to open the lens cover formally known as the aperture 
door cautious engineers had set the software to accommodate only a 
slight bit of motion and the movement of the door exceeded that 
limit 
the second time was also friday when one of the telescopes two 
highgain antennas was put through its movements a counterweight 
on the dish antenna brushed against a cable and the efforts by a 
motor to overcome the resistance again shut the system down 
the biggest impact of tuesday nights events nasa said was 
that 10 hours in the lengthy startup and calibration process were 
lost but spokesman jim elliott said no delay was expected in 
getting the first picture from the telescope early saturday 
when the telescope first went into its safemode last week the 
recovery process was a lengthy one but nasa said wednesday that 
problems of that nature are expected during a startup process that 
will take more than six months before the first real scientific 
returns

a federal reserve survey of regional economic 
conditions released wednesday found continued slow growth in april 
and little sign that industrial prices were rising too fast 
overall economic activity continues to expand slowly the 
central bank said in a survey known as the beige book prepared 
by its 12 regional banks for a may 15 monetary policy meeting 
the feds evaluation of the economy was similar to its last two 
surveys in march and january which also reported slow but 
continued expansion and moderate inflation 
however two separate commerce department reports wednesday 
indicate economic activity may be rebounding at a faster pace than 
shown by the fed survey 
the governments index of leading economic indicators jumped 09 
in march the biggest gain in 21 months meanwhile factory orders 
rose 38 percent in march for the largest increase in more than a 
year 
based on the survey alone the fed would appear to be unlikely 
to move interest rates either up or down said economist robert g 
dederick of chicagos northern trust co however fed policymakers 
likely will perceive more danger of inflation than indicated by the 
report he said 
they likely will be especially concerned with consumer prices 
which advanced at an 85 percent annual rate during the first three 
months of this year compared with a 46 percent rate for all of 
1989 he said 
this particular report does not point to the need for any 
tightening of credit this says stay as you are however my 
own view is the odds are they will tighten dederick said 
for most of 1988 and early last year the fed nudged rates 
higher to slow the economy and combat inflation during the last 
half of 1989 it permitted rates to fall in an effort to avoid a 
recession since then its held shortterm rates steady 
in the latest survey most districts report that manufacturing 
which had been particularly affected by the higher rates has 
either improved or is expected to improve despite that no 
general upward pressure on industrial prices is noted it said 
responding to recent concerns expressed by business groups and 
members of congress about a regulatory crackdown on bank lending 
the fed said its regional banks found little evidence that a 
general credit crunch is developing 
however it noted virtually every district cites some 
specific cases of credit tightening by banks with the most 
significant action taken by new england banks still the 
majority of businesses say they have not seen any change in credit 
terms and have not had trouble getting loans 
real estate particularly apartment construction remains weak 
the fed said housing prices continue to fall in the new york 
metropolitan area and in new england but there are pockets of 
strength in parts of california in minneapolisst paul and in 
upstate and western new york 
the central bank survey also pointed to some resilience in the 
consumer sector which accounts for twothirds of the nations 
economic activity 
retail sales reflect slow positive growth apparel 
has been especially strong in most districts the report said 
agriculture particularly apple and peach crops was damaged by 
the cold wet weather early in the spring the fed said farmers 
are optimistic because recent rains have diminished drought fears

a congressional panel is investigating the 
proposed swap of coalrich wyoming land for a scenic view in grand 
teton national park a deal the panels chairman calls a fire 
sale that will hurt taxpayers 
federal and state governments could lose up to 180 million 
because of the low value interior department officials placed on 
the coal it is trading according to documents compiled by the 
house government operations environment subcommittee 
the department wants to trade a 2500acre tract with 207 
million tons of coal for a conservation easement basically a 
scenic view on a ranch in grand teton park owned by 
businessmanconservationist laurance s rockefeller 
rockefeller has donated the easement to a new york cancer 
institute which would gain the coal tract under the swap 
rockefeller would retain ownership of the land the government gets 
a ban on development preserving the view 
the interior department denied the deal is a bad one for 
taxpayers 
theres no mystery to how we did it said jay guerin a 
spokesman for interiors bureau of land management its the same 
as other evaluations it compares to other kinds of tracts and 
leases involving the federal government 
the committee plans to question interior officials on the deal 
at a hearing thursday panel chairman mike synar dokla is 
questioning the decision to value both the easement and the coal at 
56 million saying the value of the coal is much higher 
synar said wednesday it strains credulity that the 
department valued the 207 million tons of coal it will give up at 
27 cents a ton 
at a time of staggering federal deficits the department of 
the interior should abandon any thought of disposing of publicly 
owned assets at fire sale prices synar said 
the 2500acre youngs creek tract is located near sheridan wyo 
the jy ranch is the largest privately owned section of the park 
rockefeller in 1987 donated the scenic view to the 
sloankettering memorial institute for cancer research 
while the department said 27 cents a ton is the right value for 
undeveloped coal in the ground with no certain market synar 
believes the value should be based on the price that mined coal 
would bring 
when coal is mined on federal land the government and the state 
where the vein is located share a royalty of 125 percent of the of 
the selling price 
in march 1989 paul r cleary deputy commissioner of the wyoming 
state land and farm loan office wrote another state official 
assuming a value of 7 per ton and a royalty rate of 125 
percent development of the federal coal would generate over 180 
million in royalties of which the state would receive some 90 
million 
according to the publication coal week which follows current 
prices similar mined coal in wyoming sold in midapril for 460 
per ton on long term contracts usually 1525 years and 380 to 
460 for contracts under a year 
at 460 the federalstate royalty would be about 119 million 
at 380 it would total some 98 million 
guerin the interior department spokesman said the 27 cents 
is the value of undeveloped speculative coal with no mine nearby 
speculative means there is no current market for the coal 
the 27 cents is a raw product to make money off that 
product you have to put in all kinds of money to develop it he 
said 
to bolster the argument that the deal is unfavorable for 
taxpayers the committee released documents indicating the coal 
would be mined and not sit in the ground 
bruce a bugbee an attorney who will represent sloankettering 
at thursdays hearing wrote interior officials last november 
sloankettering has identified parties interested in purchasing 
the coal who are willing to provide assurances they will proceed 
immediately with the goal of obtaining permits prior to 1995 
in addition ash creek mining co of tulsa okla has 
protested the exchange to the department saying it had sought a 
federal lease to mine coal on the tract synars office said the 
investigation has no connection to the fact that ash creek is 
headquartered in his state

more than 380 american officials and their 
dependents have left liberia in recent days as rebel forces have 
moved to within striking distance of the capital the state 
department said wednesday 
deputy spokesman richard boucher said he expects that by this 
weekend 400 of the 500 official americans and their dependents 
will have left the country 
he said the exodus was not an evacuation but an authorized 
voluntary departure all those who have left have done so on 
regular commercial flights 
before the departures got under way there were about 5000 
americans in liberia there are no precise figures available on the 
number americans in unofficial capacities who have left 
the government of president samuel k doe has come under 
increasing pressure since late last year from a rebel group 
believed to have received financial support from libya 
international relief agencies estimate 250000 liberians have 
been uprooted from their homes since the fighting started many 
have gone to neighboring guinea or the ivory coast 
us officials blame excesses by both government and rebel 
forces for the large number of displaced persons 
the fighting had been confined largely to the interior of the 
country but the rebels recently have been able to advance to areas 
along the atlantic coast encountering minimal resistance from 
government forces 
the liberianamerican co rubber plantation 60 miles east of 
the capital of monrovia is in rebel hands 
the liberian armed forces have evaporated outside of 
monrovia one official said 
the state department has called on the government and the rebel 
movement led by charles taylor to cease the violence it also has 
asked the government to create conditions that will permit 
displaced liberians to return to their homes 
us authorities have asked the opposing sides to pursue a 
policy of national reconciliation and ensure a climate for 
elections set for 1991 
doe observed his 10th anniversary in power last month his 
relationship with the united states has been uneasy because of 
alleged human rights violations and economic policies that us 
officials consider to be unwise 
liberia has been ineligible for us development assistance for 
years because of failure to repay loans 
liberia was founded a century and a half ago by freed american 
slaves and generally has had close ties with the united states 
since then

residents of this rural town are mourning 
for three volunteer firefighters who died while trying to help a 
neighbor clean out a 38foot well and were overcome by gas 
the deaths were the first in the nearly 25year history of the 
170member volunteer company in this mountainous region of 
southcentral pennsylvania said assistant chief robert covert 
they were goodhearted people covert said wednesday while 
he and others lingered at the firehouse thats why they got in 
trouble they were too goodhearted they would never tell anybody 
no 
james f chestnut jr 20 and richard l hershey 40 both of 
hustontown and thomas l lane 39 of mcconnellsburg died tuesday 
apparently from methane gas that had built up in the handdug well 
state police said 
about two dozen other people were treated at the fulton county 
medical center including at least six men who inhaled some of the 
gas police said 
the firefighters went to the home of nellie brown west of town 
on monday to pump out her well she had complained of the odor and 
suspected an animal had fallen in and died 
the volunteers used the pump on their truck without success and 
returned tuesday afternoon with a portable pump state police said 
lane and larry traxler of hustontown entered the well with the 
pump and took it about halfway down the 3foot wide shaft traxler 
became dizzy and returned to the surface but lane was overcome 
traxler went back for him but also lost consciousness 
hershey and traxlers father clair 41 went in but hershey 
was overcome others on the surface then called for additional help 
one company member ed karczewski 23 was home with his 
22yearold fiancee pam crouse when he heard the call for help 
over the company radio 
i heard him scream over the air that two men were trapped in a 
well karczewski said he and ms crouse got to the scene just as 
chestnut was heading down to help 
i watched jimmy go down into the well and i heard this 
screaming like i never heard before karczewski said his eyes 
filling with tears 
he said he felt helpless 
i mean our hands were tied we cant be trained for 
everything we did the best we could and it wasnt good enough 
he said 
firefighter howard melott 21 of hustontown removed chestnut 
and traxler traxler was revived lane fell into water at the 
bottom of the well and was the last to be removed three or four 
hours later 
covert said firefighters usually wear air packs when they enter 
areas that might be contaminated but he said the men thought the 
problem in the well was caused by a dead animal 
lane and chestnut were with the fire company since they were 
junior members while hershey joined about three years ago covert 
said 
the mood in the town of about 400 people was quiet wednesday 
clusters of people were at the firehouse white puffs of spent 
dandelions perched on spindly shoots in the pale green fields that 
run to the ridges framing the narrow valleys 
firefighter karczewski said he hopes other fire companies learn 
from their tragedy they should step back and look at it he 
said 
the funerals are set for friday and monday in the meantime 
other companies are handling fire calls 
thomas moriarty who heads a stresscoping team from 
shippensburg university said he and others talked with about 65 
firefighters and ambulance workers tuesday night 
we let them know that they are perfectly normal and they are 
not losing their minds and its ok to hurt he said

president bush had to pay an additional 7497 
in federal income taxes wednesday due to an error in the reporting 
of his 1989 income spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the president had to file an amended return because the one he 
sent to the irs last month did not include income from deferred 
compensation he collected last year 
he was eligible for that compensation when he turned 65 last 
june 12 under an arrangement with zapata corp the nowdefunct 
oil company he once headed fitzwater said the added income was 
brought to the attention of the tax preparers after they had 
submitted his tax return last month according to the explanation 
on his amended form 
the deferred compensation was received in the form of a paidup 
life insurance policy and should have been reported because it had 
a cash value 
the life insurance policy was valued at 26250 
the president paid interest of 4077 which accrued on the 
unpaid tax for 15 days since the income tax filing deadline 
fitzwater said 
there was no penalty fitzwater said because the mistake was 
deemed to be due to reasonable cause 
with the mistake corrected bush paid total taxes of 108879 on 
income of 483030

lawmakers state attorneys general and 
consumer agency officials called on wednesday for federal 
legislation that would make it easier to fight the 1 billion 
telephone sales fraud industry 
for many people the telephone is becoming a way to reach out 
and rob someone said rep thomas a luken dohio 
janet steiger chairwoman of the federal trade commission said 
consumers lose more than 1 billion annually to telemarketing scams 
current enforcement authority is not sufficient to swiftly and 
effectively deal with those who defraud the american consumer 
said sen john mccain rariz as the senate commerce committees 
consumer subcommittee considered two bills to require the ftc to 
issue rules governing telemarketing 
a house committee last fall approved similar legislation 
sponsored by luken 
steiger said the agency already has increased efforts to 
attack the root of fraud such as suppliers and other aiders and 
abettors of soliciting operations 
telephone fraud has grown widely in recent years for operations 
that offer phony prizes and try to sell shoddy merchandise 
including supposedly rare gemstones coins 
steiger also said the ftc also has increased cooperation with 
the states 
the proposed legislation would require the ftc to develop rules 
for and define telemarketing 
it would allow states and individuals to file federal suit for 
alleged violation of those rules currently they can only sue in 
state courts and the ftc sues in federal court 
in addition one provision would address what bryan called 
buyers remorse by giving consumers a coolingoff period or 
specified time in which they could change their minds before a 
telephone purchase became final 
sen richard bryan dnev said the problem requires a federal 
response because fraudalent telemarketers often evade prosecution 
merely by moving from one state to another 
the nature of a telemarketing operation is not a fixed 
location said bryan who heads the subcommittee 
the national association of consumer agency administrators the 
national association of attorneys general the direct marketing 
association and the national tour association support the proposed 
legislation

despite ballyhooed efforts at education 
reform student achievement is continuing a decline that began 
three years ago the government said wednesday in a controversial 
report 
education secretary lauro cavazos said the annual statebystate 
performance chart popularly called the wall chart makes it 
clear that as a nation we are still not seriously committed to 
improving education for all americans 
the chart has been criticized as promoting flawed data and 
making unfair state comparisons timothy dyer executive director 
of the national association of secondary school principals said 
american young people are simply too complex to hang on a wall 
the chart he said has as much to offer educational 
improvement as the edsel offered the automotive industry 
cavazos however defended the chart 
it is the only national measurement of educational 
performance he said its the best that we have until we 
develop other measures we will have to rely on the wall chart 
officials say the white house argued for abandoning the 
7yearold practice this year because president bush and the 
nations governors had worked to develop national education goals 
and still are devising more accurate forms of assessment 
the report found that the average american college testing 
program examination scores declined nationally by 02 of a point 
to 186 from 1988 to 1989 while the average scholastic aptitude 
test scores declined by one point to 903 during the same period 
a perfect act score is 36 a perfect sat score is 1600 
the test scores are used by colleges and universities as one 
standard of admission 
the report also found that the national high school graduation 
rate declined from 717 percent to 711 percent from 1987 to 1988 
the percentage of public high school graduates who received a 
qualifying score on advanced placement examinations declined from

the libyan government secretly offered to 
dismantle a plant that us officials said produces poison gas 
shortly before a fire was reported there in march diplomats said 
the offer was contingent on western countries paying 
compensation and agreeing to build a pharmaceutical factory to 
replace the plant western and middle eastern diplomats based in 
tripoli said tuesday and wednesday 
libya has claimed the plant in rabta 60 miles southwest of 
tripoli produces pharmaceuticals 
the offer was not accepted but some diplomats say it is 
significant because it indicates libyan leader moammar gadhafi is 
moving to resolve the bitter clash with the united states over the 
plant 
this shows that at least some libyans in the government 
are keen to have the rabta problem solved in such a way that will 
not make libya lose face one western diplomat said 
he pointed out that the rabta plant was an obstacle to libyas 
recent efforts to end its international isolation 
but other diplomats said the offer could merely have been an 
attempt to head off a possible us military strike at the plant 
the proposal comes at a time when libya and the united states 
appear to have quietly resumed indirect contacts said the 
diplomats who spoke on condition their names not be used 
numerous requests for interviews at the libyan foreign ministry 
were not granted and lowerranking officials refused comment 
the cause and extent of the march fire at rabta are still 
unknown 
the united states initially said the blaze caused heavy damage 
to the plant 
but later news reports said us authorities after a review of 
satellite photographs decided the fire was actually a hoax 
apparently an attempt to head off any us military action against 
the plant the photos reportedly showed that burn marks were 
painted on the building 
diplomats said a western european embassy employee who visited 
rabta this week reported the building was still standing but 
appeared abandoned roadblocks near rabta and missiles around it 
had been removed according to the report which could not be 
independently verified 
libyas version of the story changed in the opposite direction 
libya first told diplomats that the blaze had caused little damage 
but later it reported there had been a huge fire and said it 
suspected the united states britain or west germany of 
responsibility 
the official libyan news agency jana said wednesday that two 
west germans were being interrogated about the blaze 
a west germany foreign ministry spokesman confirmed two 
employees of a german company that helped build the rabta plant 
have been held by the libyans since march 25

el salvadors promise to push for a trial in 
the murder of six jesuits priests is encouraging the bush 
administration said wednesday 
however assistant secretary of state bernard aronson said the 
united states would closely watch how san salvador responds to a 
congressional report that strongly criticized its investigation 
theres a sense that the investigation has gotten stalled 
aronson said the report raises serious questions that need to be 
addressed 
a salvadoran colonel and eight other military personnel have 
been charged in the nov 16 killing of the six priests in the 
salvadoran capital 
el salvador said tuesday that president alfredo cristiani hopes 
the case will go to trial within 90 days the action comes in the 
face of growing criticism on capitol hill where a new aid package 
for el salvador is being considered 
secretary of state james a baker iii will send the 
congressional report to cristiani aronson said adding that baker 
has made it clear that the resolution of this case will be one 
important element in determining the nature of future us 
assistance 
the bush administration wants 375 million for el salvador next 
year including 90 million in military assistance 
house speaker thomas foley dwash appointed 19 members of 
congress under the chairmanship of rep joe moakley dmass to 
examine the salvadoran investigation 
aronson said el salvadors statement about the case was a good 
step forward but the questions that the moakley report raised 
ought to be addressed he also said the salvadoran government 
announced it would question officers that the congressional report 
said should be interviewed 
the report said salvadoran officials inclding the judge in the 
case appear reluctant to ask questions or follow leads that appear 
to implicate high ranking military personnel 
baker told congress on tuesday that he would be open to a new 
bipartisan policy toward el salvador that could include conditions 
on future aid such conditions might relate to the investigation in 
the jesuit murder case and progress on united nationssponsored 
peace talks 
with those talks still pending the leftist rebels tuesday 
launched a ferocious attack in san salvador cutting power to much 
of the city 
aronson said those attacks fly in the face and give the lie to 
the rebels professed desire to negotiate

fargo nd after watching hours of raucus drinking and 
swearing at a party near his daughters house a judge tripled his 
fines for underage drinkers in an effort to take back the streets 
from the nightcrawlers 
one attorney said judge thomas davies new policy smacks of 
age discrimination but the judge called such talk absolute 
nonsense 
davies said that by raising the fines for minors in possession 
of alcohol and for violations of fargos loud party ordinance he 
hopes to prevent young people from developing serious problems with 
alcohol when they are older 
i decided somebodys got to do something davies said 
maybe if these kids start thinking of the beer theyre holding in 
their hand as costing 300 theyll think twice about drinking it 
davies 51 who has a reputation for being tough on young 
drinkers said he watched for two hours saturday night while high 
school and college men and women wreaked havoc in his daughters 
neighborhood 
the revelers were drinking swearing loudly running through 
peoples yards and berating neighbors for calling the police he 
said 
when the party was done i thought this is fargo nd i 
thought i knew my city i thought i knew the kids said davies 
the judge said he is responding by increasing the fine in his 
court for possession of alcohol by minors from 100 to 300 and the 
fine for noise violations from 350 to 500 the maximum fine 
allowed under city law north dakotas legal drinking age is 21 
i want people in this city to know that there are people out 
there who do care who want to take the streets back from the 
nightcrawlers he said 
attorneys who have appeared before davies declined to comment on 
the move but they describe the judge as very strict on 
underage drinking and possession charges 
dwight kautzmann former president of the state bar association 
said the stricter fines may provoke charges of age discrimination 
i think the good judge might want to reconsider his 
position he said 
but davies said he doesnt worry about how others view his 
sentences 
i dont take an opinion poll on how they might be received by 
the public he said i basically operate from the gut

washington ap an international group of legislators called for 
immediate action to curb greenhouse pollutants wednesday and 
recommended a global marshall plan to help developing countries 
cope with environmental problems 
concluding a threeday environment conference the delegates 
from 42 countries urged nations to commit without delay to cutting 
the pollution that causes global warming by 50 percent over the 
next 20 years 
the actions by the interparliamentary conference on the global 
environment are little more than suggestions for an environmental 
game plan and are not binding on any country but many of the 
delegates to the conference hosted by the us congress said they 
would return home to push for legislative action along the lines 
outlined 
the aggressive strategies on global warming contrasted to the 
approach favored by president bush and senior white house 
officials bush two weeks ago told an international white house 
conference on the environment that more research was needed before 
any commitments are made for specific pollution controls 
more than 200 lawmakers from 42 nations including the soviet 
union most european countries japan and many developing nations 
were participating in the conference 
while participants promised to work on behalf of some of the 
conference goals and recommendations few suggested the effort 
would produce new laws anytime soon 
this conference has given us an agenda for action said 
james miruka owuor a conference cochairman from kenya 
i think this is a message to the executive branch here in the 
united states and in other countries as well said sen albert 
gore dtenn the conference chairman for any prime minister or 
president who says delay we are saying the time is now to 
act 
gore did not name president bush but told a news conference 
that the threeday sessions stand in very sharp contrast to the 
white house conference on global warming two weeks earlier 
we have come to a consensus agreement that the need for action 
is now that the need for action is urgent said gore who in the 
past has chided the bush administration for failing to exert 
leadership on dealing with the greenhouse issue 
the gathering agreed on a broad range of environmental goals 
including actions aimed at protecting the ozone layer reversing 
the loss of forests and committing greater resources to population 
control 
the policy statements however provided few specifics on how 
some of these efforts would be paid for including the proposed 
plan by industrial nations to help developing countries 
this socalled global marshall plan for sustainable 
development and the environment would be patterned on the 
postworld war ii economic assistance efforts by the united states 
that helped europe recover from the war officials said 
on global warming the conference declared the time to act is 
now delay exposes us our children and their children to 
calamities which we will have made irrevocable by inaction in the 
present 
in contrast to the recent international white house conference 
the legislative delegates in their policy recommendations scarcely 
touched on the need for more research 
instead the delegates called for setting a timetable for 
secific cuts in global warming pollutants by the year 2010 
including a 20 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions a 
product of burning fossil fuels elimination of 
chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs and a variety of other 
ozonedepleting chemicals and a 10 percent reduction in methane 
emissions 
altogether that would amount to about a 50 percent reduction in 
globalwarming pollutants by 2010 conference organizers said

organ donation efforts are hampered by 
physicians and hospital officials who decline to act on a patients 
wish to be a donor until they have the familys consent said a 
report released wednesday 
even though a person wishes to donate he or she may not do so 
after death unless his nextofkin can be located and agree to the 
donation said the report produced by a conference of 130 
physicians scientists and other medical and media experts 
an individuals decision to donate should in every case be 
respected the conference report said 
the report noted that after years of increases in organ donors 
the number has leveled off in recent years and dipped slightly in 
1989 to 3993 from 4069 the year before each donor gives an 
average of three organs 
last year 13290 transplants were performed about 5 percent 
more than the 12669 done in 1988 according to the united network 
for organ sharing which contracts with the federal government to 
run a national organ distribution network and registry 
currently 20466 potential organ transplant patients are on the 
unos waiting list 
for every 40 americans who die one donates an organ or tissue 
according to joel swerdlow a conference a public policy analyst at 
the annenberg washington program in communications policy studies 
which is part of northwestern university 
if a patient has expressed a wish in the form of a donor card to 
give their organs after they die physicians can act legally on 
that wish swerdlow said but physicians and hospital officials are 
reluctant fearing that family members might be upset and stir bad 
publicity for the hospital he said 
the conference report also recommended that a nationwide bone 
marrow donation network be created and that the existing organ 
donation networks be consolidated and coordinated into a single 
network 
the existing organ donation system which is carried out through 
several different networks and transplant centers matches 
available organs with patients in need 
we do that well but we have to do that better said dr 
gary friedlaender chief of orthopedics and rehabilitation at yale 
new haven hospital in connecticut 
the conference report also recommended better efforts to educate 
the public and health care professionals about the need for organ 
donors 
the conference was sponsored by the annenberg center for health 
sciences which is part of eisenhower medical center in rancho 
mirage calif the american medical association and the annenberg 
washington program

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said 
wednesday that advocates of congressional bills to boost farm 
program benefits ignore budget realities 
maybe these big high numbers make good campaign material back 
home but the day of reckoning is coming he said 
a number of 1990 farm bill measures have been approved or are 
under consideration by subcommittees that exceed limits set by 
capitol hill and bush administration budget cutters 
recent examples include action to sweeten programs for sugar 
cotton and rice other commodities including soybeans wheat and 
feed grains would be affected by supports or payments being tied 
to production costs 
yeutter said these proposals will be eliminated or watered down 
by the full agricultural committees during floor debate or in 
meetings to settle differences between the house and senate 
versions 
the subcommittees are living in a dream world and will have 
to be pulled back to reality by pressures on federal spending he 
said 
yeutter mentioned twotier dairy price support proposals 
which he said would contradict us objectives to liberalize world 
trade through the ongoing uruguay round of negotiations 
yeutter also told a meeting of american farm bureau federation 
leaders that he is not going to back off at all on the 
administrations proposal for more flexibility in the 1990 farm 
bill 
the administration wants the measure which will be a blueprint 
for us farm policy over the next five years to allow farmers 
more leeway in deciding the mix of crops they plant on their base 
acreages 
i dont know of a single farmer who wouldnt like to have more 
flexibility in his operation yeutter said 
the issue of federal crop insurance and disaster aid represents 
a tremendous dilemma for lawmakers and the administration he 
said federal crop insurance has not been a successful program and 
emergency disaster aid for drought and other weather problems has 
been a costly alternative in recent years 
thus yeutter said the administration has recommended congress 
switch to some kind of permanent disaster program there is no 
clearly visible way to repair crop insurance without huge costs he 
said 
yeutter said that if congress insists on saving crop insurance 
the money might have to come from reducing target prices for major 
crops those are used to calculate income subsidies or deficiency 
payments to farmers when market prices are low

a bush administration plan to link federal 
employees pay to performance would provide extra compensation for 
workers who live in new york los angeles and san francisco 
officials said wednesday 
the proposal also would let the government ignore salary caps 
for hiring 400 world class experts for such fields as nuclear 
safety and medical research 
were having trouble recruiting and retaining people to run 
this government constance newman director of the office of 
personnel management said in releasing the administrations pay 
proposal which would affect about 14 million whitecollar workers 
similar payforperformance proposals have been rejected by 
congress in the past but ms newman said lawmakers were beginning 
to realize the governments inability to compete with private 
industry 
the administrations plan was introduced in both the house and 
the senate this week 
last month unions that represent government employees 
criticized the proposal saying government pay cannot be reformed 
without additional money 
the opms plan which provides an additional 15 billion for 
the 1991 fiscal year would award federal employee pay raises based 
on performance rather than tenure 
in addition the opm which handles personnel matters for the 
federal bureaucracy is asking for congressional authority to 
eliminate the system that awards pay increases every year 
the administrations plan which makes dozens of changes that 
would not become fully effective until 1995 calls for providing 
geographic differentials to employees in certain cities where the 
federal government has the most trouble competing with private 
industry 
the plan would eventually provide differentials of up to 25 
percent above the workers base salary level in cities with high 
labor costs and areawide staffing problems 
though all of the cities that would fall under the geographic 
differential category havent been determined the plan calls for 
immediately providing 8 percent pay boosts to workers in new york 
los angeles and san francisco 
other highcost cities such as washington dc and boston 
might also be included if studies showed the differential was 
needed for recruitment ms newman said 
the legislation would let the government pay as much as it 
wanted for experts in highly competitive fields such as medical or 
scientific research ms newman said the cap on such pay now is 
78200

west german president richard von 
weizsaecker reiterated wednesday that polands western border is 
inviolable and said an agreement will be reached guaranteeing its 
permanence 
we agree on the course we have to chart he said we want 
to bring settlement about and we will bring it about 
weizsaecker the first west german head of state to visit 
poland began his fourday visit by meeting president wojciech 
jaruzelski and prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki weizsaeckers 
agenda also includes meetings with solidarity leader lech walesa 
and roman catholic primate jozef glemp among others 
he also will visit the former nazi death camp at treblinka and 
gdansk the former free city of danzig where the german army 
shelled the small polish garrison to begin world war ii 
weizaecker told polish television we cannot assess the modern 
times without preserving memories 
i think that youth should have their share in the painful 
awareness that the germans were the ones who had brought war 
occupation and lawlessness to poland that they had done harm to 
many millions of poles even though they bear no personal 
responsibility for that 
with weizsaecker was foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
who met with foreign minister krzysztof skubiszewski to discuss a 
treaty to be signed by a united germany establishing the permanence 
of polands postwar western border 
a representative of the east german foreign ministry will join 
talks on the treaty thursday the polish news agency pap reported 
we have difficult years and difficult months behind us 
the substance of the matter has been clarified weizsaecker said 
his trip comes as poland seeks security guarantees before the 
two germanys unify and it marks a new stage in the centuries of 
complex often bloody relations between the neighboring nations 
west germany is polands largest western trading partner and 
its support is critical to the success of economic and political 
reforms undertaken by the new noncommunist government 
but with an older generation that recalls the devastating world 
war ii invasion and occupation poland harbors feelings of 
bitterness and distrust toward germany in the rush toward 
unification embraced by powers worldwide poland has raised its 
concerns 
weizsaecker said against the backdrop of recent developments 
we can all agree on how much depends on germanpolish 
relations not only for our two nations but for the whole of europe 
we are all aware there are still problems of a psychological 
and material nature to overcome 
poland wants a seat at unification talks to guarantee its 
postwar western border and wants a treaty with the two germanys 
and the new government of a united germany making it permanent 
drawn along the oder and neisse rivers the boundary 
incorporates into poland 40000 square miles of land from the 
defeated germany the territory was to compensate poland for a 
larger section annexed by the soviet union 
leaders in both germanys offered promises concerning the border 
this week poland submitted a draft treaty to the two germanys and 
the four victorious world war ii allies the united states soviet 
union britian and france which will meet saturday in bonn to lay 
groundwork for unification talks 
the border as it is today will be inviolable 
weizsaecker said in warsaw 
the president said germany and poland share a mutual interest in 
ensuring reform and avoiding instability in the soviet union 
this german inspires confidence read a headline in 
wednesdays prosolidarity newspaper gazeta wyborcza over a 
profile outlining weizsaeckers long support for polands border

news reports suggesting that one in four younger 
men in new york is aidsinfected are incorrect the centers for 
disease control said wednesday 
the publication medical tribune sparked a flurry of news stories 
with a report this week that in the new york citynew jersey 
region one in four men aged 2544 is seropositive for aids 
other news reports said the figure applied to males 2544 in new 
york city itself 
dr james curran director of the cdcs division of hiv and 
aids said the news reports were triggered when a cdc aids 
researcher told a medical conference in baltimore that a single 
hospital in the new yorknew jersey area had reported a 24 percent 
infection rate among men 2544 
that data is from one hospital curran said adding that the 
rate was different at another participating hospital in the new 
yorknew jersey area and a third has yet to complete its reporting 
its correct for the prevalence at that one hospital curran 
said but he added a single hospital cannot be extrapolated to a 
city particularly one of 8 million people 
the cdc in tracking aids trends across the nation is 
conducting a study of aids infection rates at more than 40 
hospitals nationwide to gauge infection rates among patients who 
come to the hospital with nonaids complaints 
editors at medical tribune said they are standing by their 
report which cited findings as presented by the cdc researcher 
dr tim dondero 
dondero was not available for comment wednesday he is currently 
in china curran said 
cdc officials said the study of infection rates at various 
hospitals is continuing and results are expected to be compiled and 
released later this year 
by their very nature hospitals are a good place to examine the 
results of blood testing curran said the cdc also is monitoring 
infection rates among groups including military personnel prison 
inmates and even american indians 
its meant to give us a broad look at hiv infection he 
said but there are wide variations of hiv infection 
the cdc has yet to release findings from the hospital survey 
and cdc officials would not identify the new yorknew jersey 
hospital with the high infection rate 
curran said even though the hospital survey findings should not 
be projected to the general population we dont want to say its 
not an important problem

president bush on wednesday honored the 1990 
disabled american of the year and plugged legislation to guaranteed 
civil rights for the handicapped because disabled citizens have 
waited long enough for equality 
bush presented the presidents trophy to david schwartzkopf of 
rochester minn a high technology professional who has cerebral 
palsy and is legally blind 
in remarks to the annual conference of the presidents committee 
on employment of people with disabilities bush called for speedy 
house action on the pending americans with disabilities act which 
has been hailed as the most significant piece of civil rights 
legislation since the 1964 civil rights act banned discrimination 
based on race color national origin sex and religion 
the bill guarantees access to transportation telephone systems 
and businesses professional services and employment it would for 
instance make it unlawful to deny a job or a service to someone on 
the basis of that persons disability or perceived disability 
no longer can we allow ignorance or prejudice to deny 
opportunities to millions of americans with disabilities bush 
said we welcome you the disabled into the mainstream of american 
life because it is your life as well as ours 
more than twothirds of the disabled americans of working age 
are unemployed bush said calling that statistic intolerable 
much of that unemployment stems from lack of opportunity he 
said 
every american should be able to join the work force to the 
fullest extent of their abilities he said i look forward to 
signing a bill that will address the needs of our disabled 
citizens and frankly it is my view that disabled citizens have 
waited long enough for equality 
the disabilities legislation protecting all kinds of 
handicapped including aids victims enjoys wide support in 
congress but republicans have sought to change the pending house 
version as business interests stew about sanctions that would 
imposed on employers found guilty of discrimination the senate 
passed its version last year

agency that focuses on developing employment opportunities

the latvian popular front on wednesday 
unveiled an independence plan that it hopes would bring the baltic 
republic freedom within years without incurring moscows wrath 
deputies from the popular front told an evening news conference 
they believed they had enough votes to get the draft measure passed 
in a session of latvias supreme soviet parliament that opens 
thursday 
the popular front plan would declare independence as a gesture 
but actual independence would occur only after an unspecified 
transition period that deputies estimated would last several years 
estonia like lithuania an independenceminded baltic neighbor 
passed a similar measure march 30 
popular front deputies said they agreed to the measure after 
watching lithuania declare independence march 11 and then struggle 
unsuccessfully to persuade moscow to begin negotiations 
we didnt slam the door and then start to knock said romans 
apsitis a law professor were leaving the door open and still 
moving toward independence 
latvian president anatoly gorbunov expected to be reelected 
thursday said the proposal took into account talks that already 
have begun with moscow 
the session also will vote on dropping the soviet socialist 
from latvias name leaving it simply the republic of latvia 
said deputy janis krumins 
the popular front proposal would leave most of the republics 
sovietera constitution intact but it would also assert latvias 
claim to independence on its historic territory and its right to 
reestablish its traditional parliament 
despite the conciliatory tone of the latvian proposal deputies 
said they were against following the guidelines for secession laid 
down in a soviet law passed in april that makes it difficult for a 
republic to leave the union 
apsitis said at most latvia would consider a role in a 
reconfigured soviet confederation but only after gaining 
independence 
unlike lithuania where native lithuanians make up 80 percent of 
the population native latvians make up about 54 percent of 
latvias 27 million residents the rest are largely russians who 
frown on secession 
despite their ethnic disadvantage latvian nationalists have 
been pushing full force for the parliament to emulate lithuania 
of the 199 members of latvias new supreme soviet elected in 
march 131 are popular front supporters and several more are 
sympathizers a deputy said they need 133 votes for the required 
twothirds majority to pass the independence measure 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev recently warned latvian 
delegates that he would offer the republic special status in a 
reconfigured federation but he would not accept lithuanianstyle 
outright secession 
in the past year latvia has copied lithuanias daring political 
moves in december it abolished the communist partys guarantee on 
power in february it condemned the 1940 act that formalized its 
annexation by the soviet union and last month a large segment of 
its communist party broke off from its moscowbased parent party 
all the moves came within months sometimes weeks of similar 
lithuanian actions 
latvian activists have also created a shadow parliament to 
represent mainly native latvians 
the latvian citizens congress representing 700000 pre1940 
residents and their children convened monday and tuesday to demand 
restoration of the independence the republic lost in 1940 when 
latvia was forcibly annexed by the soviet union along with 
lithuania and estonia 
the congress claims the right to replace the supreme soviet 
during the transition to independence if the parliament votes 
against independence the congress plans to set itself up as an 
alternative authority tass said 
a poll published monday by the soviet newspaper izvestia said 92 
percent of ethnic latvians surveyed favor secession of the 
nonlatvian residents of the republic 45 percent were for 
independence said the poll it did not specify its sample size or 
margin of error

unemployment as east german companies are forced to close as demand 
for their products drops

germans aged 14 and under will be able to convert up to 2000 marks 
at 11 those aged 15 to 59 will be able to convert 4000 marks at 
11 and people 60 and older up to 6000 marks all other savings

the navy is basing its aircraft purchase plans 
on the assumption it will have 14 carrier battle groups even 
though defense secretary dick cheney says fewer are likely a top 
officer told congress wednesday 
right now the guidance is 14 carrier battle groups vice 
adm richard dunleavy assistant chief of naval operations told a 
senate armed services subcommittee 
in announcing cuts in pentagon plans to buy the b2 stealth 
bomber and other sophisticated aircraft cheney recommended 
purchasing a smaller number of the navys a12 allweather medium 
attack planes a minimum of 620 instead of the original request of 
858 
the cuts could mean elimination of two of the navys 14 aircraft 
carrier battle groups cheney said 
sen carl levin dmich chairman of the subcommittee on 
conventional forces and alliance defense questioned dunleavy on 
whether the navys acquisition plans for the a12 and other 
aircraft is predicated on 14 or 12 carrier battle groups 
presumption of 14 dunleavy responded 
fewer battle groups would limit the services ability to be 
there and do exactly what you want at a moments notice 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee has suggested 10 or 12 carriers is appropriate below 
12 youre becoming a very hollow force dunleavy said 
a battle group consists of a carrier plus the escorting 
warships usually four or five without which it cannot fight 
cheneys plan to delay purchases of the advanced tactical 
fighter may force the navy to request additional production of the 
f14d jet fighter dunleavy said 
the f14d built by grumman corp was a major point of 
contention between congress and the bush administration last year 
cheney proposed canceling it congress decided to buy 18 planes 
while requiring the manufacturer to sign a termination contract 
we may come back to congress and suggest reconsideration of 
new manufacture of f14d to make it last until the followon 
fighter comes on dunleavy said 
but if cheney decides to reduce the carrier battle groups 
additional f14d fighters may be unnecessary he said

said ive spent almost three years either with john and brian or 
having them somewhere in the house with me 
mccarthy 33 a journalist for the londonbased worldwide 
television news agency wtn was kidnapped april 17 1986 keenan 
39 disappeared while walking to work six days later

hostility between the nations it was not known what the 
antiamerican stance meant for the possibility of any further 
hostage releases 
reed who lost 60 pounds in his 3 years of captivity said he 
initially had been angry with the us administration that hostages 
were still being held

the right track to getting these people out

said that while in captivity her husband was kept blindfolded and 
bound for most of the time for about 90 minutes during the 
evenings he was allowed to watch television or read magazines or

snatched away mrs reed said

tarek reed smiled and affectionately tousled his childs hair 
saying it was just great to be reunited with his family

massachusetts reed said hide but then rethought the 
question and said id like to have a big maine lobster about 
three pounds

the kin of other hostages to relay what he knows about their 
condition 
andersons sister peggy say said reed told her terry was in 
reasonably good health although he had been having physical 
problems he said terrys attitude was still feisty as far as 
the guards go and he was always screaming for something to read 
in london a group pressing for release of mccarthy said reed 
telephoned the hostages father to say both keenan and mccarthy are 
well they have some minor health problems they exercise daily 
and read voraciously

president lee tenghui tapped his defense 
minister to become taiwans new prime minister in a surprise move 
wednesday that was greeted with hostility and suspicion by the 
opposition 
lawmaker chen shuipien of the opposition democratic progressive 
party denounced lees choice of hau peitsun the countrys only 
fourstar general as a move to drive taiwans democracy 
backward 
lee is expected to formally announce the appointment may 20 
when he is sworn in for a new sixyear term as president the 
legislature will have to approve haus nomination 
hau 71 belongs to the old guard of the governing nationalist 
party that fled to taiwan with chiang kaishek in 1949 after losing 
a civil war to communist forces on mainland china he is among the 
nationalist conservatives who still dream of returning to china to 
overthrow the communists 
hau said he accepted the offer to lead the government at a 
meeting with the president wednesday he would replace lee huan 
73 in about two weeks 
the general said in an interview with taiwans three tv 
stations president lee said the country needs me i thought i 
should not defy him 
hau would be the first general to become prime minister in 27 
years he was appointed defense minister last year after being 
chief of the 500000member armed forces for eight years 
he said his selection does not mean the military would interfere 
in politics there are many such precedents in democratic 
countries 
but opposition leader jiang pengchien called the appointment 
odd and inappropriate an apparent compromise with the 
military 
jiang said he feared the military would interfere more in 
politics the military has mistaken our societys newly emerged 
pluralism as social chaos and wants to stamp out opposition 
voices 
in recent years the nationalists have gradually loosened their 
tight reins here lifting martial law allowing opposition 
political parties and giving more government posts to the native 
taiwanese who account for 85 percent of the islands 20 million 
people 
the selection of hau stirred political speculation about its 
possible impact on the easing of restrictions on contacts with 
mainland china which has resulted in hundreds of thousands of 
taiwan residents traveling there

police lt john bradbury 
he was also under the influence of a substance probably 
heroin at the time of his arrest said van nuys police lt

were recounted in joseph wambaughs bestselling 1973 novel the 
onion field which was made into a movie 
powell and smith were twice sentenced to death for the killing 
but the sentences were reduced to life in prison when the state 
supreme court ruled tht the death penalty was unconstitutional 
powell is serving a life term 
most of smiths postparole encounters with police involved 
narcotics arrests 
his latest brush with the law occurred april 18 in van nuys 
when he argued with his female roommate and she ordered him to move 
out bradbury said when a male friend intervened smith drew an 
8inch knife and said he would cut him the lieutenant said

plans for soul singer james brown to 
perform in a benefit concert this month while he serves time in a 
workrelease program were nixed twice wednesday by the state 
corrections department 
on monday a los angeles promoter said brown would hold a 
concert may 16 the king street palace in charleston with gladys 
knight little richard jermaine jackson and others 
the corrections department said no go 
a new york concert organizer then said wednesday that the 
benefit concert had been moved from charleston to aikin 
nope the corrections department said again 
proceeds from the james brown and friends concert were to 
have gone to the nonprofit aikenbarnwell counties community 
action commission where brown works as a counselor said peter 
paul of the stephen cooper entertainment corp in los angeles 
brown serving a sixyear sentence for aggravated assault has 
been working for the commission since shortly after his april 14 
transfer from prison to a workrelease program 
corrections department spokesman francis x archibald said 
wednesday the concert is not going to happen 
this is inconsistent with his employment with the 
aikenbarnwell community agency we didnt allow him to perform 
while he was in prison and we cant let him perform down there just 
because hes been sent to a work center he said 
archibald said the concert was a commercial venture and not all 
proceeds would go to the commission the event was to have been 
filmed as part of a television special on browns life according 
to paul 
as part of being in prison your liberties are restricted and 
youre taken away from your commercial life archibald said 
that applies to entertainers stockbrokers bankers and anyone 
else who goes to prison 
officials with the king street palace and community action 
center did not return telephone calls from the associated press 
seeking comment brown will only respond to written inquiries 
center officials said 
later wednesday larry myers of the universal attractions 
booking agency in new york said concert organizers were now going 
ahead with plans for a may 16 benefit performance in aiken instead 
of charleston despite the departments stance 
the concert is to be held at the university of south 
carolinaaiken said myers whose agency has booked concerts for 
brown for more than 25 years 
the change in location notwithstanding archibald said the 
department was firm in its position 
any entertainment mr brown does has to be related directly 
and solely to his job he said we cannot allow some small 
benefit for the commission to be used as a cover for a 
larger commercial exploitation 
brown who turns 57 thursday was imprisoned in december 1988 to 
serve concurrent sixyear sentences in georgia and south carolina 
for failing to stop for police aggravated assault and weapons 
violations stemming from a twostate car chase in 1988 he becomes 
eligible for parole in south carolina in may 1991 and in georgia in 
march 1992 
brown is known for such hits as papas got a brand new bag 
i got you i feel good and more recently im real and 
living in america

a former housing official said wednesday that 
samuel r pierce jr was deeply involved in steering federal grants 
to friends while hud secretary and that one grant was arranged 
after a developer appealed to thenvice president george bush 
dubois l gilliam once deputy assistant secretary of the 
department of housing and urban development and now serving a 
federal sentence for corruption linked bush to a 500000 federal 
grant for a hispanic trade center in kansas city mo 
gilliam who admits taking bribes testified for a second day 
before a congressional panel investigating the hud scandal 
speaking with a grant of immunity from further prosecution 
gilliam detailed how he and others manipulated programs to direct 
lucrative subsidies to friends including members of congress 
sometimes before any formal applications were made 
gilliam said he arranged to profit himself and secretly removed 
incriminating documents from the agency in a medicine bag for 
destruction 
when he left the agency under a cloud in 1987 gilliam said he 
asked for and was given approval from pierce through an aide to 
receive grants for lowincome housing renovations in effect a 
severance payment worth a million dollars or more in resale value 
to developers he ultimately did not receive the grants 
im touching upon the truth gilliam said when his 
credibilty was challenged i have no reason to lie no reason 
whatsoever 
gilliams mention of president bush was disclosed beforehand by 
the chairman of the panel rep tom lantos dcalif who has spent 
more than a year investigating the scandals at hud during the 
reagan presidency 
gilliam did not accuse bush of directly ordering the hud grant 
go to a political ally but gilliam said he took unusual steps to 
award the grant in 1985 after hector barreto then president of the 
us hispanic chamber of commerce and a supporter of bush and 
president reagan met with the vice president 
gilliam said he told barreto that his proposal for a feasibility 
study was not eligible for funding by hud under the secretarys 
discretion program but barreto he said left saying he would meet 
with the vice president 
later that same afternoon gilliam said he was told by pierces 
executive assistant deborah gore dean that barreto met with bush 
she indicated to me that she had received a call from the vice 
presidents staff people indicating their support and wanted to get 
the project funded he said 
gilliam said he then persuaded a kansas city assistant city 
manager james i threatt to provide the grant from the citys 
community development block grant funds provided by hud in turn 
gilliam said he arranged to have a special grant from the 
secretarys discretionary fund go to kansas city to replace that 
money 
in other words lets make a deal you do this and ill do 
this gilliam said 
gilliam said he was unsure of the connection but that dean had 
also mentioned something about hector being on the vice 
presidents plane before the testimony lantos charged the 
project was funded in order to get a hispanic leader to accompany 
the thenvice president on a plane trip to puerto rico 
steve hart a white house spokesman was asked for a response to 
gilliams account he replied we dont know anything about it 
pierce is the object of a special prosecutors investigation 
into his handling of huds section 8 moderate rehabilitation 
subsidies program for lowincome housing renovations pierce 
testified before the panel once last year and later invoked his 
constitutional rights not to incriminate himself to avoid further 
testimony 
his lawyers have attacked gilliams testimony saying he was 
trying to win early release from prison gilliam said he is 
eligible for parole at any time and his 18month sentence is up 
later this year 
dean and two other former top aides to pierce have also refused 
to testify on constitutional grounds 
gilliam said pierce accepted huge cuts in huds overall budget 
while fighting white house efforts to cut his own secretarys 
discretionary fund gilliam said that fund was used to reward 
friends and help political allies in election years 
he described one case in which pierce told him he wanted a grant 
to go to tougaloo university in mississippi where a pierce friend 
sat on the board of trustees 
their proposal for a 300000 grant did meet eligibility 
standards gilliam said so he reached agreement with the mayor of 
a nearby town ridgeland to accept the grant and pass it on to the 
college with an additional 50000 for the towns use 
a handling charge lantos called it 
gilliam said he was shocked to learn other top aides to pierce 
kept records that listed supporters of pending grants including 
his own support of four projects 
one of those was for a proposed selma ala project gilliam 
said that when he left the agency in 1987 he arranged to recieve a 
20000 consultants retainer and onethird ownership of the 
project from which he expected 600000 to 700000 upon 
completion

hawaiians stood by stoically wednesday 
morning as the angry volcano goddess pele cut a fiery path toward 
the heart of this dying coastal town 
it may be foolish to deny the natural process that created 
kilauea volcano and now pumps tons of molten lava from it but its 
just as ridiculous to deny the ways of madame pele like the 
volcano she is respected for her awesome power 
the goddess large presence in hawaiian folklore shows how much 
respect the hawaiian people have for their land a product of 
ancient volcanic eruptions most kamaainas or local residents 
dont worship pele exclusively but pay homage to her for the 
beauty they live in 
its more a respect for the land and the volcano than a 
religion said reggie okamura of the national volcano 
observatory i have some belief its inherent to anyone born and 
raised here 
legend says if pele is not shown proper respect through the 
bestowing of gifts or if people try to ruin the land she has 
formed shell roar out of kilauea to vent her wrath 
ed lorenz has lived in the shadow of kilauea volcano most of his 
60 years and watched along with others as homes have been torched 
by the fiery lava two homes were destroyed wednesday and five 
tuesday bringing to 128 the number burned down since kilauea began 
erupting in january 1983 
more than 50 were destroyed in the past month in this community 
alone where 125 homes once stood only 31 homes remain others 
burned along the path from the volcano to kalapana 
several more homes were in danger of falling wednesday the 
volcano about six miles away has spewed lava to within less than 
270 yards of the heart of the town the kalapana store and drivein 
lorenz a believer in peles power says the goddess is as angry 
as hes ever seen 
if she wasnt mad she wouldnt damage any houses lorenz 
said ive seen a lot of flows but this is one of the worst 
lorenz says pele is upset with real estate developers 
geothermal energy drillers and marijuana growers for profiting off 
her land and not offering her sacrifices 
the east side of hawaii island is one of the few remaining 
places in the state where land is reasonably priced and many are 
looking to settle here 
geothermal companies are drilling in the wao kele o puna rain 
forest looking to convert heat from the volcano into energy many 
say pele will not stop her destructive ways until geothermal 
exploration stops 
theyre growing pakololo marijuana and making big money off 
her land lorenz said now shes taking it all away 
how many millions of dollars are they making and theyre not 
going to offer her nothing not even a feast and bring it to her 
what a bunch of dummies he said 
walter yamaguchi who owns the kalapana store and drivein 
makes food offerings to pele daily his store has been spared on 
several previous flows 
let her take it if she wants it said yamaguchi 82 she 
can do what she wants its hers if she wants it 
even gov john waihee who toured the area tuesday said the 
fate of kalapana is in peles hands 
nobody can tell madame pele when it all ends the governor 
said nobody can tell her what to do 
legend also says pele gets upset when people try to run away 
from her and that she will find and destroy them 
this doesnt seem to scare officials at star of the sea church 
workers are preparing to relocate the renowned painted church 
from destruction 
not all in the congregation want to move the church they say it 
shows a lack of faith by the congregation and a lack of respect for 
pele 
in contrast the kalapana mauna loa congregation church 
originally built in the 1800s and located at its present site next 
to the store for 102 years is not moving 
deacon ed kahanu said the churchs foundation is rotted with 
termites and isnt worth moving anyway 
if god wants to save it he will kahanu said its his 
church he can do what he wants

the democraticcontrolled senate budget 
committee on wednesday made the deepest cut yet in proposed 
pentagon spending approving a 1991 budget that pares president 
bushs military plans by 99 billion 
the panel adopted the 12 trillion spending plan which says it 
will reduce next years deficit by 43 billion on a 149 vote 
sen charles grassley of iowa was the only republican to join the 
committee democrats in voting for the package 
committee chairman james sasser dtenn who pieced together 
the proposal called it a clear and clarion call to the white 
house to get behind some real deficit reduction 
bushs budget seeks 36 billion in deficit reduction 
sasser said his package could serve as a benchmark should 
negotiations be held this year between the white house and 
congressional leaders democrats are split over whether there is a 
need for formal budget talks with bush while republicans argue 
such bargaining is a necessity 
at the white house spokesman steve hart said we are not 
prepared to respond to specifics we still feel the presidents 
budget is the best proposal up there it will continue to be the 
basis of any discussions we have 
the administration and congressional democrats have been dueling 
all year over how pentagon spending should be adjusted as a result 
of political changes in eastern europe the white house has urged a 
cautious approach while democrats are eager to use some military 
dollars for social programs and to reduce the deficit 
the 2939 billion the panel recommended for defense is 16 
billion less than the amount the house included in the budget it 
adopted tuesday its 41 billion below the amount senate armed 
services committee chairman sam nunn dga has said is needed 
next year nunn is one of capitol hills most influential democrats 
on defense matters 
the senate figure is 13 billion less than the amount military 
programs would need next year to keep up with inflation bush 
proposed 3038 billion for fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 
sasser said his committees budget addresses a new era in 
which economic vitality will be the true measure of the strength of 
the nation rather than just solely military strength 
republicans called it an unrealistic proposal that by itself 
stands little chance of accomplishing the deficit reduction it 
claims 
i believe were going to end up with minimal deficit reduction 
in spite of this budget unless there are major negotiating 
sessions with the president and congressional leadership said 
the panels ranking republican sen pete domenici of new mexico 
the budget which lays out the governments financial plans 
does not need the presidents signature but later spending and tax 
bills will and proponents of negotiations with the white house say 
the president will veto deficitreduction measures he opposes 
overall sassers plan says it will produce a deficit of 586 
billion next year the grammrudman law requires a shortfall of no 
more than 64 billion 
the measure would raise 139 billion in new tax receipts the 
same figure bush proposed and 62 billion in user fees and other 
revenues 
it would limit the growth of benefit programs such as medicare 
by 56 billion and cut other domestic and foreign aid programs by 
36 billion 
sasser said there are eight to 10 domestic programs he would cut 
or eliminate to produce the savings including the superconducting 
supercollider foreign aid and grants to renovate rental housing 
units 
weve got to realize every single program in the federal 
budget is not sacrosanct sasser said 
in contrast the housepassed budget would increase domestic and 
foreign aid programs by 56 billion next year 
the house approved its spending plan 218208 with all 174 
voting republicans opposing the package 
the senate committees budget also embraced a plan to collect 
another 111 billion in taxes by waiving penalties for taxdodgers 
and beefing up the internal revenue service that money however 
was not formally included within the 43 billion savings package 
sasser said the budget should be considered by the full senate 
within 10 days

soviet jewish immigration activists warned an 
israeli minister wednesday that israel was close to a 
catastrophe in its handling of a wave of soviet newcomers 
the heated television debate came just a day after immigration 
officials said a record 10500 soviet jews had arrived in april 
that same day hundreds of soviet immigrants rallied in a coastal 
resort town demanding employment and housing immigrants have also 
complained of a lack of job opportunities 
absorption minister yitzhak peretz facing the angry activists 
tried to appear upbeat and said that israel deals with absorption 
exceedingly well including permanent housing 
but natan sharansky the human rights champion who spent nine 
years in soviet labor camps before immigrating to israel in 1986 
sharply disagreed 
we have lines of people seeking apartments and its already 
clear that we would not have a single apartment in a few months 
for a year we speak about construction and we are not building 
the israeli media has reported 30000 soviet jews have arrived 
so far in 1990 officials say they expect about 100000 soviet 
immigrants this year compared to 12000 soviet jews who arrived in 
1989 
sharansky who heads the soviet jewry zionist forum a public 
organization that helps absorb soviet immigrants gave a much 
higher estimate 
we expect 250000 immigrants this year and at least 500000 
next year this is a real evacuation whats good for us is that 
they feel its more dangerous to stay in russia despite all the 
difficulties of absorption 
but we will really have a catastrophe with absorption 
there would be pressures on america to open its doors for soviet 
jews and lift current visa restrictions he warned 
the lack of housing employment problems and the stifling 
absorption bureacracy are felt throughout israel in the northern 
port of haifa on wednesday an ap photographer saw hundreds of 
immigrants waiting in line for processing at an absorption center 
in the coastal resort of netanya on tuesday hundreds of soviet 
jews demonstrated holding signs that read we want work we want 
apartments and absorption minister go home 
peretz said the government has approved plans to build 30000 
new apartments and that work has started on 6000 but he said it 
could take 15 months until the first of the new apartments are on 
the market 
we will have a difficult transition period peretz said 
the mass immigration comes at a time when israel faces almost 10 
percent unemployment the unemployment is especially severe in 
remote areas where apartments are abundant but soviet jews are 
reluctant to live 
yermiyahu branover a beersheba university physicist who also 
runs an immigrantoriented company in jerusalem argued that israel 
had no clear plan on providing employment for soviet jews 
fifty percent of them have academic degrees the state 
should have a professionally devised master plan and till this 
very day we dont have such a plan branover said

a water quality expert testified 
wednesday that amtraks practice of dumping raw human waste from 
its trains has no significant impact on water quality in the st 
johns river and rice creek 
dr robert harris a consultant hired by amtrak testified in 
the third day of a hearing before us district judge howell melton 
on whether the state can prosecute the national passenger rail 
service for dumping raw sewage in florida 
assistant state attorney dennis bayer who prosecuted the 
railroad in putnam county for commercial littering said the 
hearing originally scheduled to end wednesday probably would 
continue through friday 
harris estimated the amount of waste dumped by amtrak trains 
crossing bridges over the river and creek and determined there 
was no significant impact on water quality 
he estimated that the amount of waste dumped into the waterways 
by the railroad was the equivalent of the daily discharge of one 
person for a day 
if anything harris said his assumptions overestimated the 
amount of waste dumped from amtrak trains 
last december amtrak was convicted by a jury in palatka on four 
state felony charges of disposing of wastes into the two streams 
amtrak could face up to 20000 in fines if the federal judge 
determines that the railroad is bound by state pollution laws 
rather than federal laws that allow it to dump sentencing for the 
state conviction was delayed pending judge meltons decision 
fishermen had complained that they were sprayed with sewage 
while fishing under rail trestles as amtrak trains passed overhead 
amtrak conductor carl e harris testified wednesday that 
passengers are now asked not to flush train toilets when passing 
over waterways near palatka 
amtrak officials have said they would have to suspend service to 
florida if train toilets cannot be flushed onto the roadbed

a mugger with a knife robbed a messenger of 478 
million in financial certificates on wednesday forcing the bank of 
england to come to the london money markets rescue 
although no cash was involved it was a british robbery record 
far above the estimated 48 million haul from a looted london safe 
deposit store in 1987 
the staterun bank of england said it had to inject into the 
money market an amount equivalent to the face value of the stolen 
certificates it said this was to avoid problems for their owners 
and eliminate the risk that a shortage of liquidity would increase 
overnight lending rates 
the bank said a remote chance existed that the certificates 
could be used illegally to secure a bank loan but it would be 
extraordinarily difficult to use the missing paper to raise 
cash 
anyone trying to cash or use these documents would need to 
demonstrate he has good title to them said a bank spokesman who 
refused to be identified 
the bank of england said that within 45 minutes of the robberys 
being reported the bank warned money market firms and banks and 
sent descriptions of the missing property to the london offices of 
foreign central banks to circulate around the world 
police said a briefcase containing the certificates was snatched 
from 58yearold messenger john goddard as he walked from sheppards 
money brokers to another finance house in the city financial 
district 
goddard a longtime employee was unhurt sheppards refused to 
comment police said the robber was black in his late twenties and 
wielded a knife 
unescorted messengers in the densely crowded city have been 
robbed before and the system has often been called archaic 
the bank of england said the messenger system which is more 
than 100 years old was plainly unsatisfactory and by the end 
of this year it expects to have on line a new computerized system 
for settling money transactions 
wednesdays haul consisted of certificates of deposit with a 
face value of 1219 million pounds nearly 200 million and 
treasury bills worth 170 million pounds 278 million that mature 
for payment on july 30 
the paper is regularly traded between banks and some finance 
houses 
certificates of deposit are issued to companies in exchange for 
depositing large amounts of money with a bank or finance house over 
a fixed period and companies can buy and sell them as a way of 
raising money 
treasury bills are a form of iou issued by the government to 
raise shortterm money their face value can be claimed when they 
mature on a fixed date 
in january a city worker found four bond certificates each 
worth 16 million and stated to be as good as cash lying in the 
gutter outside the stock exchange they were handed back to the 
owners

archbishop desmond tutu called 
mindboggling wednesdays first talks between the south african 
government and the african national congress and said too much was 
at stake for either side to be bloodyminded 
the black anglican archbishop of cape town an antiapartheid 
campaigner and 1984 nobel peace laureate said he didnt expect 
important agreements to emerge from the preliminary talks in cape 
town which end friday 
i just think what most of the people in our community would 
like to hear is a real commitment on all sides to talks he told 
a news conference at exeter university 
and that we want to go in to substantive negotiations that 
would be important and give hope to people who are tired of the 
violence of apartheid and the counterviolence of those who oppose 
apartheid 
tutu came to britain wednesday for a threeday visit shortly 
before the talks began he lectured wednesday night in this 
university city in southwest england 
asked by reporters at londons heathrow airport if he believed 
much could be achieved in the first round he said 
i am very hopeful i dont think that any of those people on 
both sides are going into those talks bloodyminded weve got too 
much at stake too many people have already died too many people 
have suffered 
tutu said south african president fw de klerk knew that unless 
he settled with the black majority the whole question of 
sanctions and apartheid economy will be exacerbated 
tutu commented its actually almost mindboggling to think 
that they are now sitting across the table with the people they 
tried to demonize 
on the anc side they know that most of their supporters would 
like to see an end to violence the prelate said 
he called south africas racialsegregation system one of the 
most vicious the world has seen 
tutu criticized british prime minister margaret thatcher for 
opposing sanctions on south africa 
we admire her eloquency in condemning apartheid we just wish 
there was a matching consistency in action he said

gov bob martinez vetoed a 47 billion 
transportation tax hike and construction bill wednesday as 
roadbuilders ringed the capitol with heavy equipment to protest his 
decision 
the firstterm republican governor who is still trying to make 
voters forget his aborted support of a highly unpopular services 
tax in 1987 said the bills 4centagallon gas tax increase was 
unacceptable 
i believe floridians dont want to be taxed just to spend 
said martinez who trails both democratic gubernatorial hopefuls in 
the latest statewide poll 
martinez favors allowing local governments to make the tax 
decision and he said the legislatures bill allowed the people no 
voice in imposing the levy 
i fear the framers of this legislation have lost sight of the 
fact that there are limits to how deeply the people of florida are 
willing to reach into their pockets to pay for questionable 
projects added martinez he said the proposed tax would not pay 
for local road needs and spent too much for mass transit 
counting both the gas tax and a boost in the gasoline sales tax 
the bill would have raised the overall tax on gasoline from 97 
cents a gallon now to almost 15 cents 
in addition auto title fees would have risen from 3 to 24 
and a surcharge on rental cars would have increased from 50 cents 
to 2 a new wheels on the roads fee would have gone from 30 
to 100 that is aimed at additional cars such as new residents 
bringing in cars from elsewhere or people adding a second or third 
car to their garage 
the bill would have raised 36 billion over six years for 
roads bridges and mass transit as well as authorize 11 billion 
in bonds to expand the turnpike system 
protest organizers said about 85 trucks and tractortrailer 
rigs many hauling bulldozers and asphalt spreaders honked horns 
and displayed signs such as please governor my job is in your 
hands and today the highway tomorrow the repo lot 
theyre willing to drive hundreds of miles to save their 
jobs said state sen howard forman a cosponsor of the bill 
its got to be worth something 
the truck protest was the latest effort by the floridians for 
better transportation group to pressure martinez into signing the 
bill the group made up mainly of roadbuilders also made hundreds 
of telephone calls and sent some 1500 letters to the governors 
office 
earlier wednesday house speaker tom gustafson and senate 
president bob crawford implored martinez not to kill the package 
which was 1 years in the making 
i believe were at the end of our stack of cheap easy 
painless solutions gustafson said this is still needed 
legislation 
the speaker claimed the veto could paralyze the construction 
industry and that floridas roads would become more dangerous 
this plan is the legislatures compromise and it is our 
bottom line gustafson said 
martinez replied theres still four weeks to go in this 
session one thing we should never do in government is come up with 
an ultimatum all or nothing 
neither republicans nor democrats in either the house or senate 
believe a veto override is possible while the bill passed both 
chambers by the necessary twothirds margin many gop lawmakers who 
voted for the package said they would not join an override attempt 
house minority leader dale patchett said republicans will offer 
a plan containing elements martinez can support such as increased 
motorist fees and bond sales for turnpikes

was accused of paying a girl to have sex with him at his columbus 
apartment in november 1988 when she was 16 
a judge sentenced lukens to 30 days in jail and fined him 500 
he has been free on bond pending his appeal

saying in spite of his stumble hes never stopped working for 
his constituents 
lukens wrapped up wednesday evening in his hometown of 
middletown where he spoke briefly to about 50 supporters outside 
an american legion hall 
the people know men and they know my record let them judge 
lukens said nobody knows any politician in the country better 
than you know me 
robert bennett chairman of the ohio gop said lukens displayed 
a lapse of morals and had abused the trust of his constituents 
this is not a political matter its a moral matter 
congressman lukens has never denied having sex with a child and on 
that issue alone he should not represent the people of the 8th

congress in 1986 when kindness stepped down to run against 
democratic us sen john glenn lukens was reelected in 1988

cable television tycoon ted turner said 
wednesday more regulation of the industry doesnt necessarily mean 
less growth 
i dont see it as any sort of a serious threat turner told 
a new york television academy luncheon 
turner asserted the real push for cable regulation is coming 
from network broadcasters and phone companies with the former 
trying to restrain cable any way they possibly can 
virtually all cities with cable have had essentially no 
regulation of cable systems since 1985 because a federal law that 
generally freed local cable systems of rate regulation 
but with some critics charging that cable has become an 
unregulated monopoly there now are proposals before congress to 
regulate the industry according to ac nielsen co estimates 
cable serves more than 57 percent of the nations 921 million 
homes with television 
the national cable television association on whose board turner 
serves said it will cooperate to work out an acceptable regulation 
bill 
but in senate testimony in march ncta president james p mooney 
warned that reregulation of cable rates would choke off funds 
for programming and they would prefer the cable industry remain 
unregulation 
turner whose turner broadcasting system owns four cable 
networks including cable news network said he spent considerable 
time talking with key members of house and senate subcommittees 
about regulation proposals 
so far they havent come up with anything that they think 
they can get through at the current time he said but i dont 
think it will slow cable up if they do i dont think it will be 
that bad if they do 
so im not too worried about it i dont see it as any 
sort of a serious threat 
turner also asserted the ratings of networks and broadcast 
stations will decline and those of cable will climb he predicted 
that cable would be in 70 percent of the nations households 2 
years from now

the former no 2 officer aboard the uss 
pueblo who spurned a us navy heroism award 15 years ago says 
hell accept a medal honoring him and other crewmen as prisoners of 
war 
former lt ed murphy jr said he refused the navy combat 
commendation because other pueblo crew members had not been 
recognized for their heroism during 11 months of captivity in north 
korea in 1968 
the reason i rejected the medal was that some other crew 
members who deserved awards for heroism were not recommended 
murphy said 
he said he changed his mind after the defense department decided 
last month to bestow new us prisonerofwar medals to the crew 
he will accept that award this weekend to make peace with the navy 
he said 
murphy wont receive the same medal he rejected said bob white 
director of san diego county veterans services weve never been 
asked by mr murphy to represent that medal he said 
when the pow medal was authorized by congress in 1988 the crew 
of the uss pueblo specifically was excluded from eligibility 
because the united states was not engaged in an armed conflict with 
north korea when it seized the spy ship 
a pentagon legal adviser at the time ruled that the pueblo crew 
was merely detained meaning they should not get the medal 
murphy who lives in san diego county said 61 of the 82 
surviving pueblo crewmen so far have indicated they will attend the 
pow medal presentation ceremony saturday afternoon 
he blamed the pueblos skipper retired navy cmdr lloyd 
pete bucher for deciding not to recommend other crew members 
for the heroism medal he and bucher were at odds before the 
seizure and during their captivity 
i had to obey orders murphy said if i had been in 
command i would have followed the course i recommended to bucher 
get out of there at flank speed about 25 mph 
murphy is the pueblos most senior officer to be offered a 
decoration for performance of duty as a north korean pow 
navy officials say bucher the former commanding officer who 
also lives in san diego county will receive the pow medal but not 
a heroism award 
the pueblo was gathering intelligence about radar and other 
defense installations on jan 23 1968 when it was fired on by 
north korean naval vessels and captured in international waters 
one pueblo sailor was killed 
the crewmen were tortured and suffered public humiliation before 
they were freed in december 1968 
despite a formal navy court of inquiry many questions remain 
about the koreans motives for seizing the ship and why no us 
forces responded to calls for help before bucher surrendered the 
pueblo and its crew 
bucher murphy and another pueblo officer were recommended for 
courtsmartial at the time of the inquiry but the move was vetoed 
by john chafee then secretary of the navy 
bucher has accused the navy of putting the ship in a dangerous 
position and then failing to provide support

visiting czechoslovak government officials 
said wednesday they are appealing for us help cleaning the 
environment including military sites polluted by departed soviet 
forces 
czechoslovakia has long realized that industrial waste made it 
one of the worlds worst polluted countries but an unexpected 
problem has appeared at some of the sites occupied by the soviet 
army since 1968 deputy prime minister petr pithart told a news 
conference 
environment minister bedrich moldan said the big surprise was 
finding hydrocarbons chemicals of unknown origin and 
unprotected sewer systems that have polluted the ground and the 
drinking water around the sites 
the wastes have not been fully analyzed and it is too early to 
say whether they include any chemical warfare substances he said 
in answer to questions 
soviet forces have vacated three of 150 sites they occupied 
since the 1968 warsaw pact intervention in czechoslovakia leaving 
behind ripped up underground fuel tanks craters covered with dirt 
and gravel and pipelines feeding unidentified substances into 
streams and waterways moldan said 
moldan said cleanup costs were estimated at 25 million per 
site in a preliminary survey of a vacated soviet military base at 
frenstat moravia by martech usa an american company he said 
martech is opening an office in prague and forming a joint venture 
with geo test a czechoslovak engineering enterprise 
martech officials tell us that the sites can be cleaned up to 
meet your environmental protection standards but there is a great 
deal of work to be done he said we need scrubbers and filters 
to help clean up our air we need to develop hazardous waste 
storage sites and to clean up our waterways 
the ministers members of czechoslovakias first democratic 
government in more than 40 years said officials of the us state 
department and environmental protection agency listened 
sympathetically to their needs and would study the problems

about 2500 antigovernment 
demonstrators occupied a downtown square wednesday for the eleventh 
consecutive day and protest leaders softened their demands that 
interim president ion iliescu resign 
one of the protesters key demands is that the government adopt 
a proposal excluding former communists from politics 
this would exclude iliescu who held several highranking 
positions in the early 1970s under deposed dictator nicolae 
ceausescu but wednesday the rally organizers emphasized that 
iliescu was not the focus of their demands 
it may not be too late for iliescu to again represent the 
interest of the people said mihai lucian a leader of one of the 
protest groups 
we initially supported iliescu after the revolution and our 
main complaint against him now refers to what he has done since 
porotests claim that iliescu one of the leaders of the december 
revolution that deposed ceausescu has brought former communists 
into the government 
at a press conference the leaders of the four groups that 
organized the roundtheclock protests in university square said 
their demands included freeing radio and television from government 
control establishing a commission for cleansing the government 
of former communists and investigating police abuses 
opposition groups have repeatedly said that iliescus national 
salvation front which dominates the interim government has an 
unfair advantage in the may 20 national elections because the 
government controls television and radio stations 
on monday five major opposition parties threatened to boycott 
the elections accusing the national salvation front of monopolozing 
power 
on tuesday the government guarateed equal chances to all 
parties contesting the elections and offered to meet with 
opposition parties to discuss their criticisms 
protest organizers said they had received information that vice 
prime minister gelu voicanvoiculescu had expressed willingness 
to open a dialogue with them 
voicanvoiculescu could not be reached for comment but 
government spokesman vasile nastase said the government was ruling 
out negotiations with the protesters 
at university square protest leaders continued to collect 
signatures for a proclamation calling for the exclusion of former 
communist functionaries from politics they claim to have gathered 
5 million signatures the claim could not be independently verified 
in another development roman catholic nun and nobel peace prize 
winner mother theresa arrived in bucharest wednesday night for a 
visit of undetermined length

prime minister kazimiera prunskiene will plead 
the cause of lithuanian independence thursday to president bush 
whose failure to penalize moscow for an economic blockade was 
decried by lithuanias president as a second munich 
the act of independence is untouchable mrs prunskiene 
said tuesday as she began her north american swing in toronto 
canada 
still the prime ministers trip comes as lithuanian leaders 
signal a willingness to slow the independence drive in exchange for 
an easing of the kremlins punishing economic blockade 
in a letter to west german and french leaders outlined 
wednesday to the parliament in vilnius lithuanian president 
vytautas landsbergis proposed that western countries play a role in 
proposed negotiations with the kremlin 
landsbergis in a separate letter released by sen alfonse 
damato rny also said that the danger of violence or 
provocations of some sort remains very real in his republic and 
that shortages of consumer goods will eventually lead to unrest 
in large segments of the population 
president bush could help by heeding congress call for 
diplomatic relations with lithuania he wrote if this is still 
not possible at the present moment when will it become possible 
under what conditions 
bush who has agreed to a lowkey nonofficial meeting with 
mrs prunskiene on thursday has urged the soviets and the 
lithuanians to open a dialogue to resolve their differences 
bush on wednesday proposed easing restrictions on sales of 
sophisticated computers and other high tech products to the soviet 
union and east bloc just last week bush decided to let trade talks 
with the soviets proceed despite the crackdown on lithuania 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater defended the timing of 
the latest move saying it was dictated by the changes in eastern 
europe as well as the soviet union as well as pressure from 
americas allies to east the restrictions 
he said bush remains very concerned about the lithuanian 
crisis the ussoviet trade talks are progressing fitzwater 
said but its still an open question 
on tuesday fitzwater said bush was meeting with mrs prunskiene 
not as prime minister of an independent lithuania but rather as 
an acknowledged and freely elected representative of the 
lithuanian people 
mrs prunskiene who arrived wednesday evening in washington is 
also scheduled to meet with congressional leaders and with ranking 
state department officials and to testify at a public hearing of 
the commission on security and cooperation in europe the helsinki 
commission 
before leaving toronto for washington she met with canadian 
business leaders to lay a foundation for future trade agreements 
with canada 
she declined to identify the companies represented but said 
they are very substantial of all types and sizes and the meetings 
with them have been truly substantial and productive ones 
bush has declined to recognize the republics independence 
before it achieves control over its territory and institutions 
lithuania and two other baltic republics were forcibly incorporated 
into the soviet union in 1940 
bush has also deferred a decision on sanctions against the 
kremlin in the lithuanian dispute in order to avoid both increasing 
the political pressure on soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and 
complicating the prospect for talks 
lithuanian president landsbergis initially called bushs 
decision a political munich a disparaging comparison to the 
bid by britain and france in 1938 to appease nazi germany at the 
expense of czechoslovakia 
landsbergis told the lithuanian parliament on wednesday that he 
was pleased bush would meet with mrs prunskiene and added 
we hope that mrs prunskiene will more completely inform 
president bush about the situation in lithuania in the days of 
blockade 
gorbachev has declared the march 11 declaration of independence 
by lithuanias parliament invalid and illegal under the soviet 
constitution and has said there can be no dialogue until it is 
rescinded 
in toronto on tuesday mrs prunskiene said that the cities of 
moscow and leningrad have agreed to help lithuania ease the 
pressure of the soviet embargo 
she did not say exactly what assistance was offered but 
lithuania sent a delegation to leningrad last week to explore a 
possible direct exchange of goods either for hard currency or 
barter 
mrs prunskiene told reporters that reform municipal councils in 
leningrad moscow and elsewhere in the soviet union offered to 
assist lithuania because they receive many of their food supplies 
from us

sponsors of a nationwide town meeting 
radio broadcast wednesday night urged that savings from the end of 
the cold war be used to restore american roads bridges schools 
and other deteriorating infrastructure rather than merely helping 
to reduce the federal deficit 
concrete planning for conversion from a militarydriven to a 
civilian economy will be needed to restore the united states as a 
firstclass industrial country they said 
the message was being aired at simultaneous meetings in 64 
cities wednesday followed by the twohour broadcast over more than 
30 radio stations from coast to coast said jonathan feldman 
spokesman of the national commission for economic conversion and 
disarmament a private advocacy group 
author studs terkel was moderator of the program which 
scheduled appearances by political and civic leaders including new 
york mayor david dinkins ohio gov richard celeste the rev jesse 
jackson senate foreign relations committee chairman claiborne 
pell dri former democratic presidential candidate george 
mcgovern southwestern bell finance director susan fox and george 
korpius president of the machinists union 
commission chairman seymour melman economist and retired 
columbia university industrial engineering professor has long 
argued that military spending was bleeding the united states of the 
resources needed for roads schools housing and other investments 
melman 72 has been saying in lectures articles and interviews 
that by the end of the 1970s the united states was no longer a 
firstclass industrial economy by virtue of investing a smaller 
proportion of gross national product in its civilian economy than 
european countries or japan 
some voice the opinion that whatever savings accrue from a 
military winddown should be used only to reduce the size of the 
federal debt he said in a new york times article last december 
that is a sure vote for a thirdrate economy he added

a panel has completed a ranking of 3000 
medical treatments that health officials said wednesday will be 
used to help the state decide what operations are to be eliminated 
from medicaid in the future 
oregon is the first state in the country to consider limiting 
the types of treatments that will be paid for by medicaid 
officials said skyrocketing medical costs have forced the state 
to make a choice either reduce the pool of those who can receive 
medicaid or stop payment on certain expensive treatments like 
transplants it has chosen the latter 
the health services commission compiled a 167page list of of 
3000 medical treatments ranked under a costbenefit formula that 
divides the cost of the procedure by the benefit in years of life 
and improvement of life 
the commission and a panel called oregon health decision 
developed the list after holding 11 public hearings 50 community 
meetings and telephone interviews to find out which illnesses 
oregonians fear the most 
over the next two weeks the committee will weigh aspects such 
as quality of life personal choice and the communitys sense of 
compassion said paige sipesmetzler chairwoman of the 11member 
panel on may 15 it will factor together these criteria with the 
costbenefit analysis to make a final list 
under the current medicaid system the number of people who are 
eligible depends on the amount of money that is available to treat 
them when money gets tight the state rewrites its eligibility 
requirements knocking more people off the medicaid list those who 
are left generally the poorest enjoy a relatively rich package of 
benefits 
the new program while eliminating some services would add 
about 77000 oregonians to basic medicaid rolls that now number 
about 130000 officials said 
the bottom line on which treatments are excluded from medicaid 
will be made by the legislature in january among the most likely 
procedures are transplants which can run into hundreds of 
thousands of dollars 
oregon must get permission from the federal government to modify 
its medicaid program before it can implement the program 
the changes were proposed by state senate president john 
kitzhaber who is an emergency room physician 
in 1987 the legislature halted medicaid funding for most organ 
transplants using the money for other health needs such as 
prenatal care only two other states virginia and arizona exclude 
transplants from medicaid 
congress designed medicaid to provide health care to the poor 
but medical costs have forced states to adjust their eligibility 
standards to exclude many poor people 
other states are watching oregons program to see if they can 
adapt aspects ot it us healthcare spending this year is 
expected to exceed 600 billion about 12 percent of the gross 
national product up from 7 percent in 1970 officials say 
about 315 million people in the united states have neither 
health insurance nor medicaid coverage according to the census 
bureau

a federal appeals court wednesday upheld the 
constitutionality of illinois death penalty statute striking down 
the earlier ruling of a federal judge 
the threemember 7th us circuit court of appeals reversed the 
decision of us district judge harold baker who had ruled in 1989 
that the states death penalty was unconstitutional on the grounds 
that it allowed prosecutors too much leeway on whether to seek 
capital punishment 
some 120 men are on death row in illinois among them is john w 
gacy convicted of killing 33 young men and boys in the worst 
multiplekilling case in us history because of prolonged 
appeals no one has been executed under the 1977 statute 
attorneys for convicted double murderer charles silagy had 
challenged the constitutionality of the law saying their handling 
of the case was hampered by not knowing whether prosecutors would 
seek the death penalty 
the illinois attorney generals office asked the federal appeals 
court in january to overturn bakers ruling 
the 53page decision wednesday by judges michael kanne john 
coffey and frank easterbrook was the first time the federal appeals 
panel has ruled specifically on the current illinois death penalty 
law 
it rejected bakers contention that state laws allowed 
prosecutors to be arbitrary and capricious and thereby hindered 
defense attorneys 
we do not agree wrote kanne in the appellate decision 
instead the law permits the prosecutor to weigh all of the 
evidence kanne wrote in his assessment of the propriety of 
seeking the death penalty 
although illinois prosecutors can wait until after a conviction 
to announce whether they will seek the death penalty they still 
have to prove the case warrants capital punishment kanne said 
assistant illinois attorney general jack donatelli argued before 
the appeals court in january that the state statute was neither 
arbitrary nor capricious but is specific about who is eligible for 
the death penalty and includes safeguards meant to correct any 
mistakes an overzealous prosecutor might make 
wednesdays decision came two days after the us supreme court 
cleared the way for the execution of convicted murderer charles

the government on wednesday began 
dynamiting the first of 110 clandestine airstrips cut by gold 
miners on amazon jungle lands inhabited by the yanomami indians 
the worlds largest primitive tribe 
more than 250 army soldiers air force officials and federal 
police blew up the first airstrip wednesday a 600yard runway in 
the tropical rain forest near the venezuelan and guyanan borders 
the military used 374 pounds of explosives to blast open 40 
holes each 13 feet in diameter and four feet deep said federal 
police spokesman joao martins 
the rest of the airstrips will be destroyed before may 18 to 
prevent the 40000 prospectors from returning to indian lands 
martins said in a telephone interview 
he said the work will cost 800000 
president fernando collor de mello ordered the destruction of 
the airstrips following a visit to the yanomami reservation soon 
after he took office on march 15 
in addition to evacuating the miners who first invaded the 1 
million acre reserve in 1987 collor promised to blow up the 
illegal landing strips to stop planes from supplying the miners and 
transporting gold and diamonds 
martins said two airstrips will be left intact for the national 
indian foundation and the army which maintains border outposts in 
the region to combat drug trafficking and smuggling along brazils 
4000mile northern frontier 
he said troops seized one small plane loaded with cocaine on the 
airstrip just before the dynamiting operation began police say 
drug traffickers used the clandestine airstrips as transhipment 
points between colombia and bolivia 
the rush to yanomami territory began three years ago after 
government studies revealed the presence of gold diamonds tin and 
bauxite in the region 
prospectors flocked to the area leveling rain forests chasing 
off fish and game polluting rivers with mercury used in gold 
panning and spreading diseases previously unknown to the isolated 
tribe 
since 1987 the tribe has dwindled from about 9000 to 7500 
due to malnutrition venereal diseases and malaria others have 
been killed in clashes with miners 
under international pressure the government of former president 
jose sarney announced a 4 million campaign in early january to 
expel the prospectors by force if necessary 
there are about 220000 native indians left in brazil down from 
an estimated 5 million when the portuguese first landed here in 
1500 
the government has been steadily carving up indian lands 
leaving the yanomamis 19 scattered reservations totaling 5 million 
acres in brazils northwest amazon territory

the house voted wednesday to limit the federal 
governments spending on the super collider atom smasher to 5 
billion 
current energy department estimates of the ultimate cost of the 
collider range up to 8 billion 
the bill approved 309109 and sent to the senate gives the 
department specific authority to build the particle accelerator 
since the department already could undertake the project under 
other general authority to support scientific research the 
specific authority is important mostly as a sign of political 
support 
the collider a 54milesaround tunnel in which beams of protons 
will smash together to explore the secrets of matter will be the 
largest scientific instrument ever built it is planned for a site 
about 30 miles south of dallas 
under the legislation approved wednesday costs above 5 billion 
would be left to texas which has pledged 1 billion and other 
sources including foreign contributors 
the energy department did not mention the spending limit in a 
statement by deputy secretary henson moore welcoming the house 
action as an important victory 
we are pleased with the 31 margin which demonstrates support 
in congress for this exciting project said moore 
actual spending must be approved in annual congressional 
appropriations the bush administration sought spending authority 
of 318 million for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 up 100 
million from the current year 
robert roe dnj chairman of the science space and 
technology committee said the fiveyear authorization gives the 
collider the stability and continuity that it needs to flourish 
but much of the afternoons debate on the bill centered on 
making sure the federal share would not rise if the total cost of 
the project did 
when the house votes for this legislation today it is going 
on record that the ssc will not cost the taxpayer one dime more 
than 5 billion said rep robert walker rpa the ranking 
minority member of the science space and technology committee

a jury wednesday threw out a negligence 
lawsuit by the widow of a hollywood stuntman who died after 
plunging off an embankment on a motorcycle during the making of a 
film 
the jury after seven weeks of testimony decided that the film 
producers dino de laurentiis productions deg de laurentiis film 
partners and productions ltd could not be held responsible for 
dar robinsons death during the 1986 filming of million dollar 
mystery 
linda robinson burst into tears after the separate verdicts for 
each company were announced she said outside court that she would 
continue to pursue the case 
i had just hoped this would be the end she sobbed this 
was the final burying of my husband for me now i can see its 
going to be a long time thats the injustice of it 
its a really sad thing said juror linda burrow somebody 
died and its really sad and we did feel there was some 
responsibility on the part of million dollar mystery 
but ms burrow said the legal instructions given to the jury 
gave them no choice but to find for the defendants 
mrs robinsons lawyer jerry kroll maintained that robinson 
died because an ambulance was not available at the remote desert 
location where he was filming million dollar mystery on nov 
21 1986 
the attorney said it took two hours to get robinson to the 
nearest hospital after his motorcycle ran off us highway 89a and 
he fell down a 40foot embankment robinson 39 suffered massive 
internal injuries 
during the trial kroll called movie stars danny glover and burt 
reynolds to testify about robinsons reputation as a top stuntman 
and about safety on the sets where he worked 
the evidence was overwhelming that deg and the other 
defendants were negligent kroll said 
attorneys for deg and productions ltd argued that there was no 
ambulance on the set because robinson felt it was bad luck and 
an insult to his stunt abilities to have one around 
attorney john hager who represented delaurentiis deg and film 
partners said said his clients had offered a significant 
settlement to mrs robinson before trial but it was rejected 
attorney joe deems who represented productions ltd said the 
company followed screen actors guilty rules for safety and they 
are sound rules

looking ahead baptist specialists on other 
faiths see a changed american religious environment coming an 
atmosphere of floating allegiances blending of practices and 
greater variety 
at the same time protestant denominations were seen as becoming 
more and more alike with distinctions fading and a casual flow of 
memberships among them 
in the future were going to see less loyalty to a particular 
denomination and more fuzziness between denominations said gary 
leazer an interfaith officer of the southern baptist home missions 
board 
individuals will increasingly feel free to construct their own 
worldview from many options present in society rather than being 
bound by the orthodoxy of their particular faith 
leazer was among three leaders of the denominations interfaith 
witness department addressing a recent conference on the 
chaplaincy long a field that demands working among mixed religious 
outlooks 
he told the conference at golden gate theological seminary in 
mill valley calif that people increasingly will take the 
attitude of religious consumers and shop around for 
denominations and religions 
if one denomination does not offer a particular item people 
will go to another faith to find it he said 
leazer said the megatrend of pluralism will further swell the 
shifting of members among denominations already gallup poll 
statistics show a whopping increase in that phenomenon 
for example in 1955 only one in 24 americans left the faith of 
childhood to join another denomination but by 1985 that migration 
had grown to one in three a third of all members 
concurrent with that trend leazer said denominations are 
becoming more alike as differences in educational and economic 
status of members narrow closer ecumenical relations also 
furthered that process 
although southern baptists have remained formally outside the 
major ecumenical bodies other denominations for years have 
discussed doctrinal emphases and practices for greater 
understanding and mutual enrichment 
as a consequence worship of the different denominations has 
become more alike including that of major protestant denominations 
and roman catholics in some cases close attention is needed to 
tell them apart 
some formerly nonliturgical churches have gradually become more 
liturgical and some once formally liturgical churches have added 
freer spontaneous notes making for greater resemblance 
leazer director of the home mission boards interfaith witness 
department said formerly regional denominations also are moving 
into new areas including the southern baptist expansion outside 
the bible belt into all 50 states 
at the same time he noted that roman catholics have grown 
immensely within the bible belt a region where they once were few 
leazer said the biggest challenge to christians in the decade 
ahead will come from the new age movement a mix of pantheism 
selfenhancement techniques and occult spirituality and from islam 
islam will become part of the nations religious establishment 
along with judaism and christianity he said 
currently he said there are about 4l7 million moslems in 
america but that about 4000 americans mostly blacks join islam 
each year plus moslem immigrants presently there are about 59 
million us jews 
leazer also said eastern religions and occult spirituality will 
tend to become mainstream gaining more acceptance in society 
their influence felt in the churches 
people will go to a study group on hinduism on friday night 
and then come to church on sunday and try to interject those ideas 
into bible study he said 
he said new age ideas will continue to influence the way 
americans think and do religion 
he also foresaw a splurge of endoftime prophecies as the end 
of the century nears 
for many southern baptists cooperating with people of other 
religions is one of the most difficult responses to religious 
pluralism leazer said but added 
you cannot demand the right to be heard by people of other 
faiths interfaith witness allows you to build relationship with 
people so they will listen to your gospel

conservative republicans are keeping a wary 
watch on the japan trade issue a sleeper some think could awaken 
and hurt them 
it is complex contentious delicate and yet deceptively simple 
when boiled into the shorthand of campaign politics that volatile 
mix came up earlier this year at a forum on the republican future 
where campaign consultants agreed that it has the makings of gop 
trouble 
a george wallacetype democrat could have a field day with the 
issue said kevin phillips of the american political report 
paul weyrich of the free congress foundation said a national 
candidate who made effective use of trade problems and 
protectionism could come on strong in a future presidential 
campaign japanbashing sells he said it sounds macho 
rep richard a gephardt of missouri now the house majority 
leader tried it as a presidential candidate in 1988 and flopped 
gephardt thinks trade barriers and japan in particular might be a 
more potent issue now 
after long intense negotiations that produced japanese 
agreement to open its markets more widely to us supercomputers 
lumber and commercial satellites with the promise of more to come 
the aministration dropped the japanese from its list of countries 
with trade barriers that pose problems 
under the 1988 trade act the government annually lists 
countries it considers to have unfair trade practices against us 
exports that is supposed to lead to negotiations on affected 
industries and products with the threat of sanctions if the 
offending practices are not changed 
the new list a short one india is the only country left 
produced immediate protests in congress and a senate proposal to 
take away the presidents authority over the process the measure 
would require that the target list include any country accounting 
for more than 15 percent of the us international trade deficit a 
description that fits only japan 
the united states ran a 49 billion deficit with japan in 1989 
accounting for 45 percent of the total trade imbalance 
president bush said monday that dropping japan from the priority 
negotiation list didnt mean the trade problem has been resolved 
we know that we could sell more american product if japans 
markets were truly open he told the us chamber of commerce 
but weve been working hard on that and i think with impressive 
results 
over the past few months we have made more progress on trade 
issues with japan than at any other time i can recall he said 
now we are going to continue to press for progress 
bush told the businessmen if that doesnt happen he still has 
the target list and other options to open markets and ensure fair 
treatment for american products services american investment and 
ideas 
he said his top priority is to negotiate a strengthening of the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade in talks with a december 
deadline aimed at opening markets in nearly 100 countries the 
talks are being held under the auspices of the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade 
weve got to strengthen gatt as a matter of principle as a 
sign to the emerging democracies in eastern europe and in this 
hemisphere that free trade is the wave of the future bush said 
politically though and therefore in congress there seems to 
be more interest in staying mad and trying to get even our 
hackles get up said sen robert c byrd dw va one of the 
sponsors of the target list system after the administration 
dropped japan from the list 
sen lloyd bentsen of texas chairman of the finance committee 
and a potential democratic challenger to bush in 1992 said after 
the usjapan trade agreement was reached late last month that 
prior deals have produced scant results we thought we came home 
with the socalled silver bullet agreement and we finally found out 
we were firing blanks he said 
results are what counts not just agreements byrd told the 
senate on friday 
then he put the case in terms that may be heard again from 
political platforms 
the technology that the japanese use so well in many instances 
originates here in the united states we develop the technology 
with our very fine american brains and then the japanese pick 
up the technology and they commercialize it and they outsell us 
my mind boggles with admiration for the japanese their 
ingenuity their resourcefulness he said they just take our 
trade negotiators shirts and that has been the case for a long 
time

whoa somebody reign in the critics theyre 
out of control 
nbcs shannons deal needs an ace in the hole in last 
weeks nielsen co ratings it cashed in at no 52 
but youd never know it by the reviews 
you gotta love a lawyer with a screwball mojo attitude 
raved mike duffy of the detroit free press the show appears 
bound for glory enthused barry garron of the kansas city mo 
star dont miss shannons deal said david zurawik of the 
evening sun of baltimore 
why such a big deal about shannons deal 
maybe its because the shows creator is 
novelistscreenwriterfilmmaker john sayles return of the 
secaucus 7 baby its you matewan and eight men 
out maybe its because grammywinner wynton marsalis does the 
shows jazz score 
perhaps its because shannons deal is just plain peculiar 
the downandout protagonist jack shannon played by jamey 
sheridan is a disillusioned corporate attorney who leaves big 
business and hopefully his gambling addiction to hang out his 
shingle in a bluecollar philadelphia neighborhood 
life is not easy for shannon who has bad guys on his trail 
trying to collect gambling debts he also has a teenage daughter 
he feels guilty about not spending enough time with 
he runs around saying things like if i told you the truth 
id be a hypocrite i never lie 
go figure 
in a recent episode titled words to music an unknown 
songwriter comes to shannon claiming a country music star has 
stolen her song 
sample weirdness 
rock star david crosby sitting in an abandoned swimming pool 
shooting empty bottles 
sayles playing a crazed redneck whose gait looked as if he had 
just finished a twoday cattle drive 
and the unknown songstress uttering the immortal line im 
about to split a gut is there a bathroom in here 
weaving in and out of the show was a collection of background 
music that included me and mrs jones at smokey joes cafe 
and if you dont know me by now 
the making of shannons deal is almost as odd as the show 
itself 
sayles as writer did two episodes and the twohour pilot 
shown april 13 then he left 
right now im just watching it sayles said from new jersey 
where he is scouting locations for a new feature film this is 
something i always kind of planned on my idea was lets see if i 
can start the ball rolling and step away 
so sayles and executive producer stan rogow offered the jobs of 
writer and director as cameo roles tom rickman who wrote coal 
miners daughter has done an episode so has the cowriter and 
director of the razors edge john byrum 
theres another oddity in the hourlong series at 10 pm on 
mondays in a show about an attorney there is never a courtroom 
scene 
sayles said he wanted to focus instead on the amount of law 
that was done outside of court and how much it is like a poker game 
the plays the bluffs knowing when to fold and how long to stay 
at the table 
this is not the first time sayles 39 has tried television in 
1980 he wrote a perfect match about a woman with a mysterious 
illness who must locate the daughter she gave up for adoption 
the 1986 tv movie unnatural causes also written by sayles 
depicted a dedicated veterans administration benefits counselor 
struggling to link agent orange with a patients illness 
does sayles like the little screen 
its a good place to work if you can pick your spots

parts of it unbalanced out of context and superficial 
its supposed to be a guiding summary of faith but reads too 
much like an encyclopedia the bishops say it needs a more 
positive spirit and should inspire as well as inform 
yet sometimes even the information is distorted the bishops 
say such as in instances implying consensus when consensus is in 
fact lacking 
the proposed document is the first attempt at a churchwide 
doctrinal compilation since 1566 and is regarded as the most 
significant project of the worlds bishops since the second vatican 
council of 196265 
a fundamental problem with the draft is failure to differentiate 
adequately between essential and secondary teachings us bishops 
say the lack of such distinctions can lead to serious 
misunderstanding 
the bishops say the 434page document misuses bible quotations 
in a prooftext manner subordinates the role of the laity 
discounts ecumenical ties with other churches and oversimplifies 
some concepts 
those familiar with the complexity of the issues will judge 
the catechism superficial and may be led to think the same of 
catholic doctrine the bishops say 
they also say the proposed title catechism for the universal 
church is inappropriate and confusing since the document is not 
meant to be a catechism itself but a doctrinal guide for producing 
regional catechisms 
a substitute title is recommended namely a compendium of 
catholic doctrine for the preparation of catechisms 
a commission headed by cardinal joseph ratzinger chief of the 
vaticans doctrinal office drew up the proposed document at the 
behest of a 1985 international synod of bishops 
the draft was distributed sub secreto under secrecy last 
december to the worlds 2500 bishops asking their reactions by 
may 31 
the time alloted for consultation is insufficient the us 
bishops say in their 51page critique asking that the period be 
extended and that later a a second draft be subjected to further 
feedback 
the analysis was prepared by a sixbishop review committee 
headed by bishop oscar h lipscomb of mobile ala in consultation 
with 30 other experts and relayed by the bishops conference to 
the vatican 
individual bishops also were expected to send in their own 
assessments 
the joint response says the proposed document ignores 
contemporary biblical scholarship and principles of interpretation 
and uses new testmanet texts out of context in support of 
particular points 
such an approach would be highly detrimental to catechetical 
and theological practice the bishops say 
this defect works itself out in a deleterious fashion 
throughout the catechism various quotations from scripture are 
cited in a prooftext manner without regard for their proper 
meaning within their proper context 
the bishops also say the document tends to equate central and 
marginal teachings saying 
the text presents doctrines that are not fully certain and are 
peripheral to the faith such as about angels and christs descent 
into hell on the same level as central and certain and defined 
truth the bishops say 
they also questioned the drafts portrayal of jesus as having 
divine infused knowledge leaving little room for his 
developing selfconsciousness on earth 
any possibility of consequence for the humanity of jesus is 
thus excluded the bishops say 
they also say the document seems to establish a false 
separation between science and faith denigrating legitimate 
claims of science the bishops observe pointedly 
the opposition between evolution and creation is obvious only 
if one adopts a fundamentalist point of view toward the creation 
accounts 
concerning lay people the draft seems to cast them in a 
passive receptive role rather than recognizing their active 
initiatives the bishops say 
on this and other matters the draft was seen as reflecting 
attitudes predating reforms of the second vatican council 
regarding the drafts treatment of ecumenical efforts for christian 
unity the bishops say 
as the text stands it tends to emphasize disunity and appears 
to suggest that the principal reason for dialogue is to overcome 
heresy and schism 
the bishops point out another apparent retreat from vatican iis 
view that the christian church subsists in catholicism but 
isnt limited to it the draft says the church has its 
existence in catholicism 
thats close to the terminology the vatican council rejected as 
limiting christianity to catholicism the bishops note implying 
the draft hints a throwback to that insular view

a neglected piece of land next to the 
crumbling berlin wall has become the focus of controversy over how 
to rebuild what once was the center of a vibrant capital 
it is the spot on potsdamer platz one of europes most elegant 
squares before world war ii that the giant daimlerbenz wants to 
erect a new headquarters 
fears have grown in both west and east berlin that the shopping 
spree for land is about to start and that large rich western 
companies will determine the citys future landscape 
what berlin does not need is quick projects thought up in an 
illusory and shortlived reunification euphoria east berlin 
architect bruno flierl said in an interview 
one of east berlins chief planners has expressed concern about 
possible economic colonialism by the west 
after much internal bickering the west berlin city council has 
agreed to take competitive bids in july for a contract to rebuild 
the former central district 
east berlin will play a role in the decisions only after the 
election may 6 of its first democratically chosen city council 
this has caused complaints that east berliners will have little 
time to study documents affecting their part of the city 
since the berlin wall was built in 1961 potsdamer platz on one 
western side of it and neighboring leipziger platz on the other 
have been desolate symbols of a divided country 
together they had been the hub of berlin and one of europes 
busiest districts that ended with the destruction of world war ii 
the citys division and the building of the wall 
since the wall began falling in november potsdamer platz has 
become a major pedestrian crossing point motor vehicles use a 
newly completed section of fourlane highway linking east berlin 
with streets in the west that were dead ends for a generation 
makeshift souvenir stands in potsdamer platz sell chunks of the 
wall and soviet military uniforms to tourists circus tents and 
vans have sprouted on nearby land that is empty most of the year 
construction of an apartment block on leipziger platz was halted 
last fall when demonstrations and protest ended 40 years of 
stalinist rule 
an east german border guard said the work stopped when hopes 
were aroused that the area might become the center of the city 
again not just another place to build housing complexes 
he said the west german chain store wertheim planned to put its 
head office on the foundation of the unbuilt apartment house 
asked how he felt about western companies taking choice sites 
he shrugged and said of the planners i just hope they leave us 
some green spaces 
other east germans feel more strongly 
it would be unfair if all the hightech went to west berlin 
while the east was used for cheap production and storage 
facilities said guenther stahn east berlins ranking planners 
that would be a colonialist concept 
west berlins social democratic party wants to attract 
investment to the city as quickly as possible and has welcomed the 
daimlerbenz plan to build a headquarters for 8000 employees 
we cant afford to keep such an investor waiting mayor 
walter momper of west berlin told his city council recently 
the alternative list coalition partner of the social democrats 
in the council does not agree and said in a statement daimler 
is not the star around which potsdamer platz plans revolve 
representatives of the alternative list the equivalent in west 
berlin of the environmentalist greens party say the daimler 
building would be too dominant in the square they also argue 
against a company that makes armaments occupying such a prime site 
if construction of the headquarters goes forward as intended in 
1992 the alternative list demands it house a permanent exhibition 
on the role of the concern during the nazi years and on the 
possibility of converting arms production to peaceful uses 
west berlin council members agreed in april on the basic outline 
of future plans for the city including priority treatment of 
public transport and provision of open green spaces 
they did not give daimler a firm commitment but said they and 
the new east berlin council elected in may would consider it

censorship ended with the fall of 
nicolae ceausescu in december but the opposition says state 
control of television and major newspapers and of newspaper 
distribution is just as effective 
spokesmen for independent news outlets and parties say telling 
the opposition story is extremely difficult as romania approaches 
its first free elections in 44 years scheduled for may 20 
the chief target of criticism is the national salvation front 
which dominates the interim government and is suspected by many of 
seeking to bring back a milder form of communism 
many ranking members of the front including interim president 
ion iliescu are former communists who had been critical of 
ceausescu front leaders profess democratic ideals including a 
commitment to freedom of the press 
the human rights law group based in washington dc said 
after a factfinding tour in late april that many romanians 
believed the front controlled the government 
it said the fronts advantages are amplified by the 
governments control of television printing presses and newsprint 
distribution of national and opposition print media international 
communications networks and air and ground transport 
there are widespread complaints that the newspapers 
distributed by the government especially those of opposition 
parties and certain independent papers often fail to reach their 
destination are not delivered promptly or are returned when they 
could have been sold the monitoring group said 
several journalists working for independent dailies or 
opposition party papers echoed those concerns in recent interviews 
on television representatives of opposing political parties 
have three minutes to tell their story from scripts held in 
their hand said petre mihai bacanu president of the 
4000member independent journalists union 
mr iliescu could grin on the screen all day and nobody at the 
television would mind he said 
supporters of the front say iliescu and other senior officials 
get more coverage because national leaders make more news than 
obscure candidates for parliament 
several journalists said even coverage of news events was biased 
in the fronts favor 
one example cited was a demonstration organized by the liberal 
party at which the camera dwelt at length on barefooted gypsies in 
the crowd most romanians think of gypsies as idlers and thieves 
images of roses flattering graphics and stirring music were 
added to taped coverage of a front rally the journalists said 
distribution of independent or opposition daily newspapers was 
one of the problems mentioned most often 
bacanu is a member of the group that publishes romania libera 
which has a circulation of 850000 and is the largest paper 
regularly critical of the government 
he snorted when asked whether copies were reaching readers in 
the provinces people on the train simply throw them off 
becanu said 
gelu netea manager of the liberal party paper vitorul said 
state trucking companies were run run by neocommunists 
meaning supporters of the front who did not honor contracts to 
deliver the newspaper nationwide 
in bucharest the press distributor regularly either doesnt 
take our copies or only a small amount netea said during an 
interview in his office he gestured at stacks of newspapers 
several days old 
other government companies with agreements to distribute 80000 
copies nationally will take only 40000 on a given day and then 
will wait up to five days to take them to newsstands he said 
officials and supporters of the government denied the charges 
both sides agree the staterun presses which turned out only a 
halfdozen dailies in ceausescus day are woefully inadequate for 
printing the more than 700 newspapers now being published 
some typesetting machines at the central printing plant date 
from the 1940s and much of the lead is melted in an antiquated 
gasfired furnace 
welcome to gutenbergs era a foreman on the printing floor 
told a western reporter who was touring the plant

no offense to mother nature and the folks who brought us those 
zenlike infiniti ads but the car can more than hold its own 
against rocks and trees 
the 1990 infiniti q45 is in fact a delightful car that 
impresses as subtly as nature does 
theres the understated yet warm and inviting interior of the 
q45 no burl walnut here but there is plenty of smooth leather 
soft roofing material and functional wellarrayed gauges 
theres the controlled but powerful 45liter 32valve v8 
teamed with fourspeed automatic overdrive transmission because of 
advanced electronics this engine doesnt spin the wheels but 
purposely propels the car with controlled ease the powerplant 
responds almost effortlessly and seems to never be taxed even at 
high speeds and in demanding manuevers 
theres the cars moonmobile exterior with door handles that 
mirror the shape of the auto and front hood lines reflecting the 
rounded profile of the vehicle its sleek 
nissan is justly proud of its flagship for while the cars 
early advertising showing rocks and trees but no vehicle may 
have missed its mark the q45 definitely has not 
positioned against the highpriced european sedans such as the 
39700 jaguar xj6 and toyotas 35000 new lexus ls400 the q45 
with a base price of 38000 is a solid competitor 
the money buys plenty of performance in every area including 
standard antilock fourwheel disc brakes that produce stable sure 
stopping its impressive to stomp on the brakes and find hardly 
any diving movement at the front end in the test car there was 
just a gradual dip in the front even when i stopped suddenly from 
high speed 
because the test car had the optional high capacity actively 
controlled steering the q45 also barely showed any body roll or 
yaw in sudden lane changes and side moves this option provides 
fourwheel steering that briefly turns the rear wheels in the 
opposite direction of the front wheels when needed and then 
switches them to the same direction at high speeds 
infiniti engineers worked wonders with the q45 suspension it 
seemed a bit more taut and less cushiony than that of the lexus 
yet i barely noticed bumps the infinitis 45liter 
278horsepower engine will push the car from 060 mph in 75 
seconds says nissan which limited top speed to 150 mph via 
electronic controls to ensure drivers dont vault into the next 
galaxie 
the 4liter lexus produces 250 horsepower and reaches 60 in 79 
seconds 
the downside is that the q45s fuel economy is lower than that 
of the lexus ls400 16 mpg in the city versus 18 mpg for the ls400 
making the infiniti subject to a 500 gas guzzler tax at purchase 
the q45 exterior is nearly as aerodynamic as the lexus 30 drag 
coefficient versus 29 for the lexus though the front end of the 
lexus seems a bit more square all metal seams on the infiniti test 
car were lined up with impeccable precision 
inside the q45 has wide soft front seats that are adjusted 
electronically and have two memory settings stitching in the 
leather seats lines up with back and leg muscles for maximum 
comfort the thick leatherwrapped steering wheel with air bag 
telescopes upward and tilts to the desired position electronically 
the standard bose sound system was terrific with big buttons 
for easy adjustment a sunroof cruise control heated outside 
mirrors and sun visors that had to be released from the ceiling by 
pressing a button were other features 
sitting in the back seat i tucked my toes under the front seats 
when they were all the way back on their tracks but my knees still 
didnt touch the seat backs and legroom was decent if the front 
seats were moved up a bit 
the middle passenger in back would have to contend with the 
large hump in the floor that accommodates the infinitis rear drive 
mechanisms 
the trunk was flat and deeply spacious 
bmw and mercedesbenz owners make up the largest group of early 
infiniti buyers infiniti reports that 50 percent of the tradeins 
have come from owners of those german makes another 25 percent of 
the tradeins are domestic models such as cadillac and lincoln and 
the rest are japanese cars such as maximas accords and cressidas 
more than 3350 q45s were sold in the first five months after 
the car was introduced in november infiniti says it does not have 
projections for expected sales 
the typical buyer is male median age 42 the company says a 
majority are married and most have household incomes approaching 
100000 a year at least 90 percent have college educations 
because the q45 is a new model consumer reports magazine does 
not list owner reports of trouble

he may be 50 but that doesnt make bugs bunny 
an old gray hare 
the wascally wabbit and longtime torturer of elmer j fudd hits 
the halfcentury mark this year and the carrotchomping star with 
the brooklynese tongue is aging as gracefully as ever 
everybody knows who i am doc i dont cayuh where dey are or 
who dey are even in mars dey know about me heh heh heh bugs 
once said in an interview with the associated press 
success didnt come easily for bugs he had to change his name 
and work underground before making it big but hes enjoyed a 
career many hollywood stars living or sketched would envy 
he surfaced this year as a presenter on the academy awards in 
1958 he won his own oscar for best animated short feature 
knighty knight bugs the rabbit since has become a saturday 
morning cartoon fixture and makes more prime time appearances each 
year than bob hope 
on dec 21 1985 bugs received a star on hollywoods walk of 
fame admittedly not in the best spot he sits between cowboy 
actor rory calhoun and actress lurene tuttle who made such 
memorable movies as the clonus horror white mama and 
final chapter walking tall 
the brash bunny was the consumate of cool always undersized 
hes outwitted grouchy gremlins daffy duck and guntoting galoots 
in haredevil hare he defends the honor of earth against a 
martian with hightop sneakers named commander x2 
hes sung opera and tweaked the nose of pompous tenors he 
outraced tortoises and hounded hunting dogs 
and his rabbit hole was his castle to be defended to the death 
against developers and intruders of course you realize this 
means war bugs would say to those who provoked him 
youd never see bugs with a girlfriend and like milton berle 
hed flirt in drag to confuse a foe but bugs was his own rabbit 
fiercely independent and fresh 
bugs encounters with frequent foil fudd are regarded as 
classics the easilyfrustrated fudd was battered by bugs from 
infancy to old age in a series of shorts 
after tormenting fudd in one episode bugs turned to the 
audience and clucked i do dis kind of stuff to him all through 
the picture 
rarely did fudd ever turn the tables on his animated adversary 
once is a story in which elmer portrays a millionaire whos gone 
off the deep end he and his shrink keep repeating the same tagline 
throughout the cartoon my name is elmer j fudd millionaire i 
own a mansion and a yacht the oftrepeated line finally gets to 
bugs who checks into a mental hospital 
in another cartoon a wagner sendup fudd clad in viking 
horns sings to the strains of ride of the walkueres kill 
the wabbit kill the wabbit 
the bugsfudd battles most featuring elmer as a befuddled 
hunter have recently been honored in a museum of modern art 
exhibit and preserved at the museum of cartoon art the latter is 
planning an anniversary retrospective for bugs the 50th birthday 
will also be marked with widespread release of bugs video 
collections a primetime special and a special bugs magazine 
produced by life magazine 
its been more than his lucky rabbit feet that have kept bugs on 
top through the decades hes outlived the flintstones seen a 
future without the jetsons and continues to ride high in the age of 
the simpsons 
so what is it about bugs that makes him timeless 
bugs is a natural person leading a normal life until someone 
aggravates him then he fights back explains chuck jones now 
77 who directed more than 50 bugs shorts in other words hes a 
sort of counterrevolutionary 
bugs is hero to many of us he does the things wed like to do 
but dont have the noive to carry through 
his vintage cartoons are currently seen all over television by a 
third generation of kids in addition to saturdays he appears 
daily on national cable stations nickelodeon and tnt and is the 
toprated show on both 
jones admits bugs can be a bully or a nuisance so he took great 
care in setting the rabbit in situations in which he would remain a 
sympathetic figure 
mel blanc the man of 1000 voices who gave life to bugs would 
defend the rabbits honor if he didnt like a script telling the 
writer bugs wouldnt do that or bugs would never say that 
it was blanc who changed happy rabbit a niceguy bunny of 
the late 1930s into the rough and tumble rabbit weve come to know 
and love blanc ditched the wimpy name added the dese and 
dose of streetwise brooklyn and rechristened the character bugs 
the west as they say is histowy 
bugs debuted on july 27 1940 in the short a wild hare and 
he was off and running 
early on he became part of the world war ii propaganda pitch 
turning up a a draftee a superpatriot marine a real superman 
a rabbit the riveter assembly line worker today hes joined 
the just say no war on drugs appearing in an antidrug cartoon 
that aired last month 
through the years hes become even more underdog than he was in 
the beginning increasingly opting for brains over brawn such 
adaptability has served him well in dozens of shorts bugs has 
remained a hollywood trendsetter 
long before sigourney weaver battled aliens bugs went 
manoamano with commander x2 
forget field of dreams and other baseball flicks 
baseball bugs featured a slowballing bugs playing all nine 
positions and defeating the gas house gorillas bugs scales the 
empire state building for the gamesaving catch 
robert de niro as untouchable al capone the rabbit took on 
legendary tough guys edward g robinson and peter lorre in 
racketeer rabbit and bobby ds turn as jake lamotta in 
raging bull had little on bugs showdown with boxing brute the 
crusher 
theres much much more bugs as the straight hare in a jekyll 
and hyde sendup bugs evading two robinson crusoe types bent on 
turning him into roast rabbit torturing two french chefs with 
similar intent outwitting a rabbitbashing witch on halloween 
and theres more than a touch of bad boy in bugs in addition to 
his fudd abuse he frustrated yosemite sam to the point where 
yosemite screams great horney toads driven daffy duck near 
daft and dispatched dozens of animated assailants 
aint i a stinker he says in one cartoon 
but it hasnt been all good news for the rabbit over the last 50 
years the death last year at age 81 of blanc who had been the 
voice of practically all the warner bros looney tunesmerrie 
melodies characters was a blow to fans around the world 
but blanc didnt take the rabbits whats up doc with him 
his son noel and actor jeff bergman have taken over as the 
bunnys voicebox and bugs is still going strong 
to anyone who might think an aging bugs has seen his best days 
well as bugs might say he dont know me vewy well do he

cheeseburger pepsi 
no pepsi coke the ordertaker will be able to say in a 
variation on the line that the late comedian john belushi made 
famous years ago 
burger king corp the nations secondlargest hamburger chain 
said tuesday it is switching to cocacola co as its official 
domestic soft drink supplier ending an association that started in 
1983 with pepsicola co 
miamibased burger king said cocacola products such as 
cocacola classic diet coke sprite and minute maid orange soda 
will replace pepsicolas soft drink lineup in its restaurants over 
the next three months 
analysts said the loss of the highprofile account is a blow to 
pepsicolas prestige but it would have minimal impact on earnings 
for either softdrink company 
pepsicola based in somers ny said the loss of the burger 
king account was not entirely unexpected in view of recent 
management changes at burger king it was acquired by the british 
conglomerate grand metropolitan plc in january 1989 and switched 
advertising agencies last year

fountain portion of the us soft drink business and is the primary

switch to cocacola at its 1100 companyowned restaurants when its

pizza hut taco bell and kentucky fried chicken all owned by its 
parent pepsico inc it also serves the dunkin donuts subway 
shakeys and ground round chains according to spokesman tod 
mackenzie 
mackenzie said pepsi hopes to continue serving franchiseeowned 
burger king restaurants but burger king spokeswoman cori zywotow 
said her companys franchise agreements require licensees to go 
along with its choice of a soft drink supplier 
there are about 5400 burger king restaurants in the united 
states including 800 owned by burger king and 4600 owned by 
franchisees 
neither burger king nor cocacola would estimate the value of 
the softdrink account 
burger king awarded its soft drink account to pepsicola in 1983 
after years with cocacola and reaffirmed its intention to stay 
with pepsi only last june 
but ms zywotow said both soft drink companies were asked for 
new proposals recently and the company decided to switch she said 
cocacola will work with burger king on new drink dispensing 
technology and marketing programs 
emanuel goldman who follows the soft drink business for 
painewebber in san francisco estimated pepsicola sales at burger 
king amounted to about 65 million cases or about 135 percent of 
pepsis annual fountain volume the switch would boost cocacolas 
fountain volume by 65 percent he said 
goldman said the switch should cut annual earnings of pepsico by 
no more than a penny a share while adding 15 cents a share at 
most for cocacola 
but in addition to lost sales volume the switch costs pepsi a 
valuable opportunity to have people to sample its products 
a lot of people go into burger king and see the name coke or 
pepsi how does that spill over into supermarket sales that is the 
part of it that isnt known goldman said 
jesse meyers editor of the trade publication beverage digest 
estimates the switch could add a percentage point to cocacolas 
405 percent share of the overall us soft drink market while 
cutting pepsicolas 307 percent share by the same amount the 
market is valued at 274 billion wholesale 
meyers said burger kings decision to switch may be a response 
to the recent rapid growth of pepsicos restaurant operations 
while pepsico is selling chicken tacos and pizza burger king 
is saying that competes with the share of stomach we are trying to 
fill he said 
pepsis mackenzie said there is more myth than reality to 
that line of reasoning

an 80 percent drop in chrysler corps 
firstquarter earnings wasnt nearly as bad as expected and shows 
the companys costcutting program may be taking hold analysts say 
the nations no 3 automaker reported tuesday it earned 71 
million or 32 cents a share on revenues of 756 billion during 
the first three months of this year it earned 351 million or 
150 a share on revenues of 966 billion in the same period last 
year 
thats good news chairman lee iacocca said wall street 
appeared to agree 
chrysler stock closed up 75 cents tuesday at 1575 on the new 
york stock exchange mondays closing price was a 52week low 
as recently as late last week analysts were speculating that 
chryslers results would flirt with the breakeven point 
our surprise is that we got as much costsavings benefit as 
quickly as we did said analyst charles brady of oppenheimer amp 
co of new york 
last october chrysler began a program aimed at slicing 15 
billion from its annual costs by the end of 1990 analysts said 
tuesday it appears the company is on track to reach that target 
they are well on their way to accomplishing their 15 billion 
costreduction goal said analyst scott merlis of morgan stanley 
amp co of new york it seems like chryslers management is 
delivering 
they already have put their money where their mouths were 
analysts have forecast earnings declines of more than 75 percent 
for general motors corp and ford motor co when the nations two 
largest automakers report their firstquarter results later this 
week 
i think the street is beginning to think that ford and gm may 
have some costcutting surprises for this quarter or the next 
one merlis said 
analysts estimated that chrysler cut 200 million out of its 
standing costs during the first quarter 
it shows the leanness and the meanness of management hammering 
home on the costcutting front said analyst john kirnan of 
kidder peabody amp co of new york 
not everything was rosy with chryslers financial picture the 
company spent about twice as much on incentives during the first 
quarter and the automaker continues to fight a tough battle to hold 
on to its share of the us market chrysler eked out a slim 8 
million profit on its car operations in the quarter 
people still want to see the product side improve kirnan 
said 
the next major product change chrysler has on tap is its new 
minivan which hits dealerships this fall chrysler which derives 
much of its profit from minivan sales sells more of the popular 
vehicles than all other minivan makers combined but competitors 
have begun to nibble away at its market share 
this summer the company will be shutting down both of its 
minivan assembly plants for four weeks for retooling that could 
spell trouble for the companys second and third quarters 
i would not be surprised to see a red number for the third 
quarter said analyst david healy of barclaysbzw of new york 
but the second quarter should be profitable probably a good bit 
better than the first quarter 
the company also said its chrysler financial corp subsidiary 
posted an 89 million profit for the first quarter up from 86 
million in the fourth quarter of last year

new englands slumping economy and real estate 
market have pushed many banks to the brink of failure and 
eventually could force them into government hands analysts say 
last week regulators seized control of home owners federal 
savings bank the largest savings and loan in massachusetts 
analysts said tuesday this action was a signal of things to come 
are we going to see a rash of closures in the next few months 
probably not said gerard cassidy a banking analyst at tucker 
anthony inc but when this thing finally washes out three four 
five years from now were going to look back and there probably 
is going to be at least two dozen 
the sinking economy combined with a declining real estate 
market has given many banks a staggering amount of troubled loans 
banks have had to divert money into reserves while watching their 
capital shrink to precarious levels 
james mcfarland deputy regional director of the federal deposit 
insurance corp said there would probably be a handful of 
failures this year 
but he stressed that well below 10 percent of the banks in new 
england have poor ratings from the government 
in massachusetts and connecticut 32 banks at the end of 1989 
were losing money so fast it would deplete their equity within one 
year according to veribanc inc a wakefield mass firm that 
monitors the industry 
its a good bet there will some seizures among them 
especially with the economy going the way it is said warren 
heller research director for veribanc 
analysts say the direction of the economy will be the most 
important factor in determining whether weak banks survive 
bank of new england corp for example lost more than 1 
billion last year due largely to its real estate portfolio the 
bank now is operating under government orders and has instituted a 
plan to improve its financial health but executives have 
acknowledged the recovery hinges on the new england economy 
other banks have admitted they are in peril home national corp 
of milford mass has disclosed its subsidiary home national bank 
is seeking financial assistance from the federal government to 
continue operating 
eliot bank in boston reported a 30 million loss for the fourth 
quarter of 1989 and said it expected regulators to take such 
actions as they consider appropriate if the bank could not raise 
capital 
another teetering company is one bancorp of portland maine 
which has 26 million in capital but 290 million in troubled loans 
one bancorp like many savings banks in new england converted 
to stock ownership in the 1980s amid the boom on wall street that 
provided them with billions of dollars in new capital which many 
used to move into the thenbooming construction market 
the only thing they knew how to do was lend money in real 
estate said james moynihan senior vice president of advest inc 
in boston they were all tripping over each other to find 
projects 
this created several problems for savings banks many had been 
accustomed to home construction lending but felt pressure to move 
into other commercial loans to get better returns and improve their 
shareholder earnings mcfarland said 
but when the real estate market declined poor loans were 
exposed and the losses mounted 
heller at veribanc said some savings institutions were already 
in weak condition before they raised money by converting to stock 
ownership 
this was a onetime capital infusion heller said they 
had their one chance and they blew it

campbell soup cos chief said the companys 
sluggish performance has forced it to slash its headquarters staff 
and turn aggressive to stave off a possible sale or merger 
we want to have winning results which is in terms of earnings 
returns and cash that would make any raider look at us and gasp 
said david w johnson president and chief executive officer 
campbells announced tuesday it would eliminate 364 positions 
from its headquarters staff a cut of 19 percent in a bid to 
strengthen its bottom line and pacify disgruntled shareholders 
fundamentally the company has not been delivering the kind of 
financial performance investors shareholders and wall street would 
like it to have our record is very poor johnson said 
the company also decided to halt plans for a new 35 million 
headquarters proposed for the citys waterfront said johnson the 
first outsider to head campbell in its 121year history 
the financially strapped city has been counting heavily on the 
plan as the lynchpin of its economic revival 
a 35 million highprestige worldclass headquarters at a time 
when we are financially embattled would have been irresponsible 
said johnson i think it is not understood how embattled we are 
johnson chosen in january to take over campbell because of his 
experience at beleaguered companies said 267 employees received 
pink slips tuesday morning 
he said 97 positions at the headquarters had been eliminated 
through attrition since jan 1 
we cut out those jobs to become leaner and more productive and 
more effective johnson told reporters at a news conference 
outside company headquarters in camden 
the cutbacks effective immediately will save about 17 million 
over the first full fiscal year and reduce campbells headquarters 
staff to 1588 employees 
johnson who was chosen to head campbell because of the changes 
he spearheaded at gerber products co did not rule out additional 
layoffs in camden and elsewhere if the performance does not improve 
the announcement came nearly two months after campbells closed 
its historic 121yearold manufacturing plant in camden 
eliminating 940 bluecollar jobs 
johnson said campbells plans to maintain a presence in camden 
he says the company is considering seeking an outside builder for 
the waterfront project and leasing office space to other businesses 
camden mayor aaron a thompson who met with johnson several 
months ago remained optimistic campebells will play a role in the 
citys 500 million waterfront revitalization project 
their commitment to the waterfront is an unaltered 
commitment thompson said tuesday 
but not everyone shared thompsons confidence that the company 
will reamin in the economically depressed city of about 85000 
residents 
that is an enormous impact on this economy said camden 
county freeholder director robert andrews 
we know theyre going to be leaner because theyre laying our 
people off said andrews but how do we know theyre going to 
stay here 
johnson said campbells is facing some tough times of its own 
with earnings lagging at nearly half the rate of other food 
competitors 
in december some members of campbells founding family put 
their stake in the company up for sale and said they would push for 
a sale of the entire company but three children of longtime 
chairman john dorrance jr who received control of their fathers 
313 percent share of the company have vowed to maintain their 
ownership and keep campbell independent 
under johnson campbell has closed three domestic plants and two 
overseas plants a distribution facility in chicago and integrated 
canadian and american operations since january campbell also has 
put its juice bowl business up for sale 
we are really in the middle of a fight back to remain strong 
and independent and headquartered in camden said johnson

baxter international inc said it cleared the 
sale of a manufacturing plant in israel with the department of 
commerce to avoid the appearance of a conflict with us law 
nevertheless the worlds largest hospital supply company now 
finds itself the target of allegations by a former employee that it 
sold the plant to get off the arab leagues blacklist of companies 
doing business with the jewish state that would violate a us law 
forbidding american companies from participating in foreign 
boycotts 
baxter has agreed to build a similar plant in syria to 
synthesize intravenous body fluids 
baxter spokesman les jacobson said tuesday the company has 
higher hopes for a profitable operation in syria than in israel 
where he said skyrocketing inflation helped make the plant a 
moneyloser 
company officials didnt seek to curry favor with the arabs by 
selling the plant in israel he said 
jewish leaders are demanding an explanation from baxter 
headquartered in deerfield north of chicago 
the issue arose from a memorandum about baxters middle east 
operations that is purportedly on file in the arab leagues boycott 
office in the syrian capitol of damascus the memo suggests the 
1988 sale of the israeli plant and the removal of baxter from the 
arab boycott list were linked 
jacobson said baxter officials repeatedly sought opinions from 
former secretary of state cyrus vance and from the commerce 
department on its middle eastern operations beginning in 1982 
he said baxter had received assurances it was doing nothing 
improper in selling the israeli plant which was built in 1971 and 
employed about 200 people 
because the law is unclear in many respects we felt we needed 
some clearance and guidance jacobson said 
we went to them and said heres what were doing in the 
middle east is this ok they said theyd see no problems with 
that 
the antiboycott law was enacted in 1977 when vance was in 
office to discourage corporations from seeking arab business by 
promising to avoid commerce with israel 
jacobson said the law is murky in defining the conditions 
under which it would be proper for a us company to provide to an 
arab country information about its dealings in israel 
he said baxter probably discussed with syrian government 
officials its plans to sell the israel plant not as a condition of 
being dropped from the arab league blacklist but rather in the 
context of negotiations that resulted in their april 13 agreement 
to jointly build a plant in syria the plant is scheduled to open 
late next year 
jacobson questioned the authenticity of the arab league memo 
copies of which were sent to baxter directors and to the wall 
street journal by dr richard fuisz is a washingtonarea 
businessman and former chief executive officer of baxters middle 
eastern medcom subsidiary 
fuisz sued baxter in 1985 for wrongful termination and 
defamation after he was ousted from his job and demoted jacobson 
said the lawsuit was settled but fuisz reportedly remains bitter 
toward his former employer 
fuisz could not be reached for comment telephone calls to his 
home in great falls va went unanswered 
neither the commerce department nor the securities and exchange 
commission which are reviewing the companys middle east 
activities would comment 
the memo says baxter promised not to do any more business with 
israel 
jacobson said baxter continues to distribute a variety of 
products in israel and has no plans to stop doing so 
the memo implies that we agreed to halt any further commercial 
activity in israel which is flatly untrue jacobson said we 
know very well that would be illegal

hospitals must rely on greater technology to 
combat rising healthcare costs but the gadgets will take their 
cue from the supermarket and banking industries experts say 
a consulting firm on tuesday unveiled a prototype of its 
hospital of the future crammed with information not medical 
technology to help keep track of and treat patients 
designed by andersen consulting with the help of the american 
college of healthcare executives the prototype uses everything 
from bar codes to handheld computers from smartcards to 
pneumatic tubes from voice recognition to fiber optics to cut time 
and money spent shuffling around information 
forty percent of a nurses time is spend doing administrative 
and clerical chores said jay toole andersens partner in charge 
of healthcare 
hospitals have lagged behind industry in taking advantage of 
technology toole said they spend only 3 percent of their budgets 
on information handling compared to 8 percent to 10 percent for the 
banking and insurance industries 
the technology may be directed more towards saving money than 
saving lives toole said but it nevertheless would give healthcare 
workers time to practice their craft and improve the quality of 
care 
while most hospitals already have their financial operations 
computerized and may use computers in clinical or patient care 
there has been little communication among the areas said gene 
handley education director of the american college of healthcare 
executives 
we have to achieve greater economies in the area of 
information technology he said were looking for economies 
that allow one system to communicate with another system 
andersen consulting a subsidiary of the accounting firm arthur 
anderson amp co invested 7 million in its hospital of the 
future display which opened tuesday at dallass infomart 
technology market 
more than 40 different vendors including digital equipment 
corp hewlettpackard co and ncr corp have been linked with 
programming that allows the normally incompatible systems to 
talk to each other 
a patients introduction to the system begins in admitting 
where financial information is taken and rooms assigned that 
information is transmitted immediately to the floor where the 
patient will be taken and to the business office 
at the same time the patients medical and financial 
information is put on a smartcard a creditcardsized piece of 
plastic that can hold up to 1000 pages of text 
later when tests or medication are ordered the laboratory and 
pharmacy systems ship results or records back and forth the system 
also keeps better tabs on billing designers said so that fewer 
charges are lost 
information can be entered through bedside or handheld computer 
terminals or at a nurses station 
theres even a system that converts xrays into computer 
language allowing the images to be transmitted not only around the 
hospital but to a doctors office for example for outside 
consultations 
other systems help keep track of operating room schedules and 
supplies physicians also can tie in to computer databases which 
contain the latest medical information 
the technology also reaches into homes through a portable 
computer than can remind patients when and what medicine to take 
and can transmit that information back to a physician or home 
healthcare agency

a federal bankruptcy judge has approved an 
interim plan giving ames department stores inc a new leader and 
allowing the discount retailer to borrow 40 million to keep 
operating 
the new chief executive officer stephen l pistner would be 
paid 15 million a year plus a bonus of 500000 to take on the 
job of trying to bring the company out of chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection 
the 2 million in total compensation is more than twice what the 
chief executive at k mart the nations largest discount chain 
received in 1989 and more than 400000 above what the top 
executive received last year at sears the nations largest 
retailer 
but us bankruptcy court judge howard c buschman iii on 
tuesday gave the companys plan interim approval saying he was 
comfortable that the salary is within the range that any executive 
would demand to take on the ames job 
the rocky hill retail chain also got the courts approval to 
borrow up to 40 million from chemical bank during the next week to 
begin paying its bills and start restocking its 680 stores 
during nearly a nearly fivehour hearing buschman heard 
testimony about amess need for a new leader and money to keep the 
company operating 
the board members of this company have determined that the 
company is a ship without a rudder buschman said they have 
determined that there is low morale within the company and with 
creditors of the company and that the appointment is needed to 
begin to address the problems faced by the company 
ames filed for bankruptcy court protection here last week 
listing assets of 167 billion and liabilities of 144 billion 
the company said it had to file because it could not get new 
financing from its bankers and because suppliers had stopped 
shipping merchandise to its stores 
ames chairman james a harmon testified that the company began 
searching for a new chief executive officer in early march 
he said ames also hired a consultant specializing in executive 
compensation and was told that the company would have to pay a 
substantial salary to attract an executive willing to take on the 
challenge of returning ames to profitability 
harmon did not mention ames former chief executive officer 
peter b hollis who resigned monday after more than three years at 
the helm hollis engineered the 1988 acquisition of the zayre 
stores which ultimately forced ames into chapter 11 
hollis received 889053 in total compensation in 1988 the most 
recent figure made public 
but harmon did say that amess board of directors was convinced 
that the company needed a new chief executive officer quickly 
there was general concern about the morale at the company 
he said with suppliers upset shareholders distressed creditors 
concerned there was a great deal of pressure on the executives and 
the company was deteriorating quite rapidly it was important that 
we move to bring in a new ceo 
harmon said ames decided to hire pistner 58 because of his 
experience in turning around troubled retailers pistner has headed 
the target dayton hudson montgomery ward and mccrory chains 
during more than 20 years in the retail industry 
buschman signed an interim order tuesday authorizing pistners 
appointment in order to give amess creditors more time to study 
pistners background and comment on his hiring buschman said a 
final hearing on the matter will be held may 15 
buschman also signed an order tuesday allowing ames to borrow 
nearly 40 million from chemical bank during the next week ames 
officials testified that the money was needed to begin ordering new 
merchandise for the companys stores in time for the important 
backtoschool and christmas seasons 
buschman scheduled another hearing may 8 to rule on whether ames 
can borrow up to 250 million from chemical bank while it works to 
reorganize its business

the government and the airline industry are 
offering 3 million for information leading to the arrest 
conviction or thwarting of air terrorists 
in a move praised by relatives of terrorism victims and endorsed 
by three government agencies the air transport association on 
tuesday added 1 million to a government reward program that 
already totaled 2 million 
and in another joint step tuesday airline officials and the 
federal aviation administration opposed proposed legislation that 
would increase the governments role in inspecting aging airliners 
of the antiterrorism reward ata president robert j aaronson 
said this should be a powerful incentive for people within or 
close to terrorist organizations to reveal plots before they are 
hatched 
aaronson said the airline trade group would match any government 
reward up to 1 million if it involves a threat or attack against a 
us airline and the money also would be available through the fbi 
to match rewards designed to combat domestic air terrorism 
morris d busby state department ambassador for 
counterterrorism said at an ata news conference that rewards 
already have been paid in the governments program but details 
would not be disclosed 
faa administrator james b busey said the increased rewards send 
a strong message to terrorists that the united states and the 
aviation community are fully committed to this battle against 
terrorism 
william baker fbi assistant director said investigators are 
meeting every day with foreign authorities in an effort to keep 
the pressure on to solve the december 1988 bombing of pan 
american flight 103 over lockerbie scotland that took 270 lives 
no one has been charged or arrested but authorities have said 
they believe middle east terrorists planted plastic explosives 
inside a radio cassette player that became part of checkedin 
luggage 
meanwhile faa associate administrator anthony broderick told a 
house hearing that the proposed agingairliner bill would increase 
government liability and could cost between 1 million and 2 
million per plane 
robert e doll a united airlines vice president who heads an 
atasponsored industry and government task force on aging 
airliners said adding inspection duties for the faa could impair 
other safety efforts 
the bill sponsored by democratic and republican leaders of the 
house public works aviation subcommittee would require the faa to 
thoroughly inspect each airliner during the last year of its 
economic design life unless they pass an faa inspection planes 
would be grounded after they reach a predetermined life span

a year ago the average price of a 20inch 
chain saw of the type used by many farmers was about 365 says the 
agriculture department today the same saw is around 375 
thats an increase of less than 3 percent but it illustrates 
that the creep of inflation is still gnawing at consumers 
including the nations farmers 
overall the departments national agricultural statistics 
service reported this week the april index of prices paid by 
farmers for commodities services interest taxes and hired labor 
was up 34 percent from april 1989 
the agency reports prices for a list of items periodically 
during the year some are listed quarterly others twice a year or 
at other intervals by whatever time period that is used most 
products are currently more expensive than before 
two general exceptions to the price creep according to the 
latest report are prices for field seeds and fertilizer 
for example a year ago the usda said timothy was 8210 per 100 
pounds compared with 132 in april 1989 tall fescue dropped to 
8510 from 111 a year ago and public and common alfalfa seed 
was 157 per hundredweight against the yearearlier price of 180 
the index for fuels and other energy prices was up 16 percent 
from a year ago although some items showed sharp declines from 
earlier this year bulk delivered diesel fuel for example 
averaged 807 cents per gallon in april down 203 cents from 
january but up 1 cent from a year ago 
prices collectively for automobiles and trucks were up 35 
percent from april 1989 although new trucks in the 15 to 2ton 
class and used cars were down slightly all other vehicle prices 
were higher 
feeder livestock prices were up 15 percent from april 1989 the 
report said prices of feeder pigs at 134 per hundredweight were 
up 4150 from january 
for tractors twowheeldrive models in the range of 50 to 59 
horsepower were shown at 17700 each compared with 17300 last 
october and 17400 a year ago the 110129horsepower models were 
45300 compared with 44600 last fall and 43200 a year ago 
but the larger fourwheeldrive tractors in the range of 170 to 
240 horsepower were reported at 76600 each down from 79500

the agriculture department is proposing to 
relax the current rules on the imports of some meat and milk from 
countries that are free of footandmouth disease and rinderpest 
under current regulations shipments of fresh chilled and 
frozen meat and milk and milk products must be sealed in the 
country of origin and the seals must be intact when the shipments 
arrive in the united states 
if the shipments stop in countries that have footandmouth and 
rinderpest the cargoes are denied us entry if the seals are 
broken 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said the proposal to be officially 
published today would recognize that the current method of bulk 
packaging and containerized shipping is one of the safest means of 
handling meat and dairy products 
the proposal would allow the seal to be placed on a container 
rather than on the entire hold or compartment of a carrier it also 
would establish certain conditions under which the meat or milk 
products could remain eligible for us entry if the seal has been 
broken or replaced 
public comments on the proposal can be sent by july 2 to chief 
regulatory analysis and development ppd aphis usda room 866

rapidly growing imports pushed japans current 
account surplus down 308 percent to 535 billion in the fiscal 
year ended march 31 the finance ministry reported wednesday 
it was the third consecutive year that there has been a decline 
in the surplus in japans current account the widest measure of 
its trade flows 
the surplus was well below the level forecast by government 
economists in february the economic planning agency predicted it 
would register 61 billion 
economists attributed the decline largely to the weak japanese 
yen and its impact on prices 
while a lower yen reduces the value of japanese exports there 
is a time lag before lower prices result in higher volume in 
addition higher crude oil prices measured in dollars added to 
the cost of imports 
for march the current account surplus grew to 81 billion from 
63 billion a year earlier in march 1989 there had been an 
unusual surge in imports before a 3 percent sales tax took effect 
the next month the ministry said 
exports were virtually unchanged in fiscal 1989 at 2679 
billion compared with 2674 billion the previous year imports 
surged 149 percent to 1977 billion in the third consecutive year 
of doubledigit growth the ministry said both were measured on 
the basis of settled contracts 
robert alan feldman an economist and vice president of salomon 
brothers asia predicted that japanese exports would revive in the 
coming year sending the current account and trade surpluses 
higher he said export volume was likely to begin growing this 
summer as the weaker yen makes japanese products cheaper overseas 
in march the us dollar averaged 14890 yen 14 percent higher 
than its level a year earlier 
meanwhile in the first 20 days of april japan posted a 115 
million trade deficit compared to a 31 billion surplus a year 
earlier the ministry announced 
japans trade surplus totaled 71 billion in march the latest 
full reporting period up from 66 billion a year earlier 
the current account includes trade in goods and services and 
transfer payments while the trade balance records only trade in 
goods exports and imports in the current account are measured when 
contracts are settled

their recent sharp drop 
organization of petroleum exporting countries ministers began a

later they broke up into smaller negotiating groups a tactic they 
sometimes find more productive 
all opec countries were represented at the session except iran 
whose oil minister was expected said kemal saiki opec information 
officer 
it is an ongoing circle of consultations saiki said 
the gathering was expected to last one or two days 
ministers made offered no comments as they began the session 
but they said when they arrived tuesday that they were aiming for a 
quick agreement on voluntary shortterm cuts during may and june 
how much output to trim and how the reduction should be 
allocated among the cartels 13 members have to be decided 
iraqs oil minister issam alchalabi on tuesday pegged current 
output at between 237 million barrels a day and 24 million barrels 
a day well above the ceiling of 221 million barrels a day 
saudi arabia kuwait and the united arab emirates are the main 
quota violators analysts say the uaes oil minister mana saeed 
otaiba said tuesday that his country was observing its quota 
the overproduction has caused a glut just when demand 
traditionally slackens in the second quarter and that has 
depressed prices 20 percent since january and well below opecs 
minimum reference price of 18 a barrel 
north sea brent blend the most widely traded international 
crude oil fetched a spot price of 1660 a barrel in london this 
morning up 10 cents from late tuesday 
the average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by opec 
stood at 1537 per 42gallon barrel last week down from 1712 a 
barrel in the first week of april and well below the 18 minimum 
reference price 
opec needs to cut its surplus output by as much as 15 million 
barrels a day to achieve an oilprice recovery opec president 
sadek boussena said tuesday 
boussena who also serves as algerias oil minister said the 
single target is clear how to eliminate the surpluses existing in 
the market in order to allow a price recovery it is a single 
target and im certainly hopeful we can achieve that target 
asked how much output needed to be cut he responded it 
certainly is something between one and one and a half million 
barrels a day 
asked if such a cut would come from current production he 
replied affirmatively 
iraqs chalabi said he was willing to consider reducing the 
official production ceiling for the remaining two months of the 
halfyear and that all members should contribute to an output cut 
we are prepared to even discuss lowering the ceiling at the 
present chalabi said adding we are not exceeding our quotas 
we are good guys 
the ministers hadnt been expected to address their official 
quotas and minimum reference price until they held their full 
regular meeting on june 25 
indonesias oil minister ginandjar kartasasmita said opec 
needs to solve its problem of overproduction quickly those 
overproducing will have to cut 
saudi arabias influential oil minister hisham nazer said he 
wasnt happy with current price levels yes we want them 
higher he said 
opecs members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab

the governments chief economic forecasting 
gauge rose 09 percent in march its biggest increase in nearly two 
years the government said today 
the gain in the index of leading economic indicators designed 
to forecast economic activity six to nine months in the future 
meant the gauge nearly regained the 10 percent loss it suffered in 
february 
it was the steepest increase since a 16 percent gain in june 
1988 before dropping in february the index had risen for three 
straight months 
but while the gauge was up in march some analysts were 
concerned that rising inflation if it does not force the federal 
reserve to increase interest rates certainly will not encourge the 
central bank to lower them 
high rates would slow further the already sluggish construction 
auto and manufacturing sectors of the economy 
were looking for a slowdown in activity in the second and 
third quarters due primarily to high interest rates said paul 
getman an economist with regional financial associates in west 
chester pa 
well have an extremely sluggish construction sector and 
lackluster activity elsewhere including business investment which 
has been pretty good he added 
indeed construction which relies on lowcost loans slowed 
even before the start of the second quarter the commerce 
department reported on tuesday that construction spending dropped 
14 percent in march its steepest decline in more than a year 
but in a second report today the department said orders to 
factories for manufactured goods rose 38 percent in march 
continuing to rebound from a 55 percent decline in january the 
steepest fall since a 7 percent decrease in december 1974 
the march gain was the largest in more than a year and together 
with februarys 18 percent advance offset the january decline 
six of the 11 forwardlooking statistics contributed to the 
increase in todays leading indicators led by a gain in new plant 
and equipment orders 
other positives were an increase in the price of raw materials 
an increase in orders for consumer goods higher stock prices 
slower business delivery times and a drop in weekly unemployment 
claims 
negatives included a decrease in building permits a decline in 
the backlog of manufacturers unfilled orders and a drop in the 
money supply 
two of the components were unchanged the average workweek and 
an index measuring consumer confidence 
the various changes left the index at 1452 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 the index edged up 01 percent from october through 
march on top of a 02 percent gain the previous six months 
although many analysts see slow growth ahead there is virtual 
unanimity that the economy has avoided a recession 
the business cycle trough is pretty much behind us 
contended kermit baker director of economics at cahners economics 
in newton mass any risk of recession prettty much ended with 
the firstquarter gnp report youre not going to hear too many 
recession forecasts cropping up over the next few months 
the firstquarter gross national product the nations total 
output of goods and services rose 21 percent compared to a 30 
percent increase for all of 1989 according to a commerce 
department report last week 
that was much stronger growth than many economists had predicted 
as the year began at that time many forecast gnp growth would be 
little improved from the fourth quarters 11 percent rate the 
slowest in three years some even said the economy could topple 
into a recession 
but despite the surprising strength the report also contained 
bad news on the inflation front a 65 percent annual rate the 
steepest increase since 1981 and up sharply from the 45 percent in 
1989 
interest rates were pushed up starting in december 1988 by the 
federal reserve as it sought to curb inflation by tightening 
credit as inflation seemed to moderate the central bank permitted 
shortterm rates to ease during the second half of 1989 
but many economists now fear the fed may have no choice but to 
retighten credit to keep inflationary pressures under control

wheat futures prices rose this morning on the 
chicago board of trade after the agriculture department announced 
it had targeted china for sales of 2 million metric tons of us 
wheat at subsidized prices 
soybean futures were lower while corn futures were narrowly 
mixed in early trading 
the usda had been rumored to be planning large offers of export 
bonus wheat to several countries including china but the size of 
the offer announced this morning was a little higher than they 
had anticipated said joel karlin an analyst with research 
department inc a commodity research firm in chicago 
the wheat market drew further support from extremely wet weather 
in the southern plains that threatens to delay the winter harvest 
and possibly reduce crop yields karlin said 
soybeans were down slightly after tuesdays rollercoaster action 
that saw prices zoom to ninemonth highs and then collapse to close 
lower 
in early trading wheat futures were 1 cents to 3 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in may at 369 a bushel corn was 
cent lower to cent higher with may at 283 a bushel oats were 
cent lower to cent higher with may at 165 a bushel soybeans 
were 3 cents lower to 1 cents higher with may at 626 a bushel

if you put your money in a conservative 
highyielding investment that offers convenience liquidity and 
diversification of your money how can you lose 
for one answer to that question ask the legions of people who 
have owned shares of bond funds and other income mutual funds 
through the first four months of 1990 
while these funds which have aggregate assets of 300 billion 
have been earning current yields of 8 percent to 9 percent or more 
from their holdings of such things as treasury securities and 
highgrade corporate bonds their typical total return to 
investors of late has been less than zero 
from jan 1 through april 26 an index of 535 income funds 
calculated by lipper analytical services inc assuming 
reinvestment of dividends showed a loss of 257 percent 
what went wrong for these funds was a rise in the general level 
of longterm interest rates that almost no one had predicted 
going rates on longterm treasury bonds climbed from below 8 
percent at new years to 9 percent in late april 
increasing rates on new fixedincome securities coming to market 
forced the prices of existing bonds downward by about 10 percent or 
more in turn depressing the net asset values of the funds that 
owned those bonds 
yieldconscious investors with a true longterm perspective 
might be inclined to take all this in stride they continue to get 
their current income after all and they retain the hope that 
their principal will recoup its lost value should interest rates 
turn downward again 
but they have no assurance that those hopes will be fulfilled 
within any given period of time the interestrate volatility of 
the late 1970s and 1980s quite apparently has persisted into the 
early months of the 1990s undiminished 
once again an unexpected rise in longterm interest rates 
confounded experts who were anticipating a totally different set of 
events said vincent agnew an investment manager at chicago 
title and trust co 
for people considering new fund investments the latest 
developments have their positive side because of the rise in 
rates their money now can command higher current yields than 
before 
perhaps even more important rates on shortterm securities like 
treasury bills have risen only slightly while longterm rates 
jumped so for the first time in two or three years the yield 
curve representing the range of maturities in the credit markets is 
no longer flat 
thus investors in interestbearing securities are starting to 
see at least some modest extra reward for taking the risk that goes 
with tying up their money for an extended period of time as of the 
beginning of may yields on treasury bonds exceeded yields on bills 
by more than threequarters of a percentage point 
but if that improves the odds a little it still gives no 
assurance of any sure bets for mutualfund investors if longterm 
rates keep rising income funds net asset values will keep losing 
ground 
wright investors service of bridgeport conn argues that 
highquality bonds are attractive right now on the basis of good 
potential for sharply lower yields and higher bond prices by 
yearend 
at chicago title analysts take a warier view the argument 
for lower us interest rates was predicated on a sluggish economy 
accompanied by declining inflationary pressures 
its possible that the consensus view might still prevail but 
dont count on it

us trade representative carla hills said 
today that world trade talks had entered a crucial period with a 
variety of disputes still to be resolved 
hills was in california for talks with trade ministers from 
japan the 12nation european community and canada over ways to 
resolve contentious issues blockikng completion of a round of 
tradeliberalization talks 
the trade officials hope the three days of discussions will 
inject a new sense of urgency into the negotiations which have 
been under way since 1986 
if common ground is not reached there are fears that the most 
ambitious round of tradeliberalization talks ever undertaken could 
end in failure 
1990 is a pivotal year for the world economy hills said 
down one path lie open markets expanded trade economic growth 
and prosperity down the other lie closed markets nations turned 
inward and gravely diminished prosperity for all 
hills speaking to a convention of business reporters and 
editors appealed to the news media to do a better job of covering 
trade issues 
she said reporters overemphasize stories on trade frictions 
with such countries as japan and downplay more significant stories 
such as the effort to negotiate a new global trade agreement 
hills appeared before the society of american business editors 
and writers before the trade talks got underway at a resort in 
napa calif 
the talks which were launched almost four years ago in uruguay 
are being held under the auspices of the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade the 96nation group that governs world trade 
the uruguay round is scheduled to be completed in early 
december but with a little over 200 days left deep disagreement 
still divides the negotiators 
the bush administration has made a new global trade agreement 
its top trade priority this year and hills has portrayed possible 
failure of the talks in stark economic terms 
she has warned that without major reforms the trading system 
that produced four decades of global prosperity could disintegrate 
into protectionism and shrinking living standards for both 
industrial and developing countries 
the accords we seek are essential to our future prosperity 
hills said it may be the last best chance this century to 
create the trading rules we need for the next century 
the administration is counting on the reforms to attack a us 
trade deficit that has topped 100 billion for six consecutive 
years 
hills has estimated that tearing down protectionist farm 
barriers worldwide could boost us farm exports by 11 billion 
annually amounting to 3400 for every farmer 
similarly strengthening rules to protect against patent and 
copyright piracy could pump 60 billion annually into us 
corporate coffers the administration estimates 
the other big item on americas wish list is removal of barriers 
to trade in services a fastgrowing part of world trade where 
experts believe the deficit could be lowered by opening foreign 
markets to us banks securities firms and insurance companies 
but the us negotiating package has met with resistance 
the 12nation european community with its politically powerful 
collection of small family farms is strenuously resisting the 
american call for a timetable to phase out all tradedistorting 
farm subsides 
third world countries led by india and brazil are fighting the 
effort to remove barriers blocking foreign banks and other service 
companies for fear that giant multinational firms will overwhelm 
their domestic institutions 
there was no clear indication what will come from the three days 
of discussions being held at a plush resort in napa calif 
officials hope at the very least to come closer to common 
ground in some areas to give guidance to lowerlevel negotiators 
who will meet in geneva switzerland in july for a critical 
drafting session 
it is quite likely that some of the thorniest problems will have 
to be taken up when president bush hosts americas major allies at 
the sevennation economic summit this summer in houston 
the final negotiations will be held dec 37 in brussels but 
without substantial movement before that time there are concerns 
that the final round of talks could collapse given the complexity 
of the issues being addressed

it is still true that the surest way to the top 
of a large american industrial corporation is to find a relatively 
low level job and work your way up 
no it is not a myth 
the myth created in recent decades is that its now more 
common to move into the top job by bouncing from one company to 
another eventually leveraging into the chairmans office 
but eugene jennings examining his research all the way back to 
1939 it is the largest corporate mobility data base of its kind 
finds that it is now far more common to name a chief from within 
the company 
that finding upsets what has become a given in many popular 
accounts of making it to the top but it is conclusive 
jennings who pioneered socalled mobility studies says that 
three out of four individuals named to the top spot in the 1980s 
were what he calls natives compared with only 48 percent in the 
decade of the 1960s 
the professor professor emeritus of management michigan state 
university set out in the late 1940s to study mobility patterns 
or ascendancy routes in industrial america in effect his interest 
was making it in america 
because this was his intent he excluded birth elites and 
privileged elites namely founders children of founders and 
investors and their proxies who probably entered the company by 
raiding it or buying it 
with these exclusions he was able to concentrate on mobility 
patterns and trace the routes to corporate success 
he found that in every category he defined natives were more 
likely than socalled migrants to head americas large industrial 
corporations and that the pattern was becoming even more 
pronounced 
he found for example that natives outscore migrants in every 
age group among the early arrivals or those who achieve the top 
job at 49 years or younger normals age 50 to 575 years and late 
arrivals 58 years or more 
in spite of what some executive recruiters might like to hear 
he found that even when migrants assumed the top job they rarely 
did so without first becoming subordinates and working their way up 
from there 
age and experience he found in his review remain extremely 
important in naming a chief the widely held notion that chief 
executive officers are younger these day is also a myth the fact 
is precisely the opposite 
to illustrate since the 1960s the average age at which chiefs 
are appointed has risen steadily and is now more than 58 years in 
that time the number of younger chief executives has declined 
tenure has risen chiefs remain in the job longer than they used 
to tenure during the 1960s was less than seven years on average 
it is now more than nine years and rising increasingly boards 
waive compulsory retirement rules 
it is a myth too says jennings that corporate boards turn to 
migrant chiefs when the company is in trouble no he says they 
turn to natives the facts suggest older experienced homegrown 
chiefs are treasured by boards 
a popular notion is that more chiefs of us industrial 
companies have had global experience the better to deal with the 
emerging global economy to some extent the impression is false 
jennings found for instance that fewer rather than more chiefs 
have had the experience of living and working abroad for the

the european communitys executive 
commission proposed measures wednesday to significantly reduce 
pollution from diesel trucks 
carlo ripa di meana ec commissioner for the environment said 
if approved by ec governments and the european parliament the 
proposal would force all trucks in the 12nation trade bloc to cut 
their emissions of carbon dioxide by more than half 
hydrocarbons also would be cut by half and nitrogen oxides by 
slightly less than half making ec diesel trucks as clean as those 
from austria and switzerland 
in the two alpine nations trucks producing more than 82 
decibels are banned between 10 pm and 5 am and ripa di meana 
plans to propose similar curbs on noise pollution this fall 
new antipollution norms will be introduced in austria and 
switzerland on oct 1 1991 ec hauliers were worried the new norms 
would affect their transit through the two nations 
ripa di meana said his proposal had been prepared in full 
consultation with the truck industry these talks had revealed 
that the technology to reduce pollution from diesel engines was 
available in the 12nation trade bloc so new norms could be 
mandatory by oct 1 1991 
ripa di meana said he would also propose legislation to cut the 
amount of sulphur in diesel this fall

american general corp embroiled in a bitter 
proxy battle with torchmark corp for control of the company said 
today that it was putting itself up for sale 
in a surprise annoucement at the annual shareholders meeting 
chairman harold s hook said american general was vulnerable to 
possible acquisitions at a discount price and it decided to offer 
itself for sale to realize the maximum value for stockholders 
hook said that if the company isnt sold in one piece the board 
of directors would be prepared to sell off assets 
by late morning on the new york stock exchange american general 
was off 125 cents to 40 a share torchmark was up 875 cents to 
4450 a share on the nyse 
the decision to sell the company was made late tuesday 
according to hook on the eve of todays crucial proxy vote in 
which torchmark is seeking to elect its own slate of directors to 
the board 
hook said the company couldnt announce its decision to sell the 
company until today when shareholders cast their ballots 
we are confident we elected our slate of directors hook 
said to the shareholders applause i wish that was the end of 
the story 
torchmark has been waging a proxy fight to elect five nominees 
to the 15member board since it withdrew an unsolicited 634 
billion cash and stock offer for american general 
torchmark chairman ron richey said he was pleased with todays 
announcement from the outset our objective has been to 
negotiate a transaction with american general and we look forward 
to sitting down with them to discuss a merger proposal he said 
in a statement 
american general officials had vigorously urged shareholders to 
vote for the companys own slate of directors it also had resisted 
efforts by torchmark to hire an investment bank and appoint a panel 
of independent directors to evaluate acquisition proposals 
the outcome of todays proxy vote wont be known immediately it 
will take up to two weeks before the final tally is announced 
because every proxy must be counted by hand american general 
spokesman john pluhowski said 
houstonbased american general with subsidiaries that operate 
in 50 states and canada is battling with the much smaller 
birmingham alabased torchmark which is best known for its 
liberty national mutual insurance subsidiary 
american general has assets of 32 billion torchmark with 
assets of 5 billion has set aside 15 million for the proxy fight 
a federal judge in tennessee allowed torchmark to continue its 
proxy fight on tuesday one day after a state commissioner ordered 
an end to the battle today a federal appeals court upheld that 
decision 
us district judge thomas a wiseman said tennessee revenue 
commissioner joe huddleston had overreached his authority and 
interfered with the rights of american general stockholders to vote 
their shares 
torchmark representatives also said that an indiana superior 
court judge had delayed an administrative hearing on the proxy 
battle in that state until next monday 
huddleston had ruled monday that torchmark violated tennessee 
law by soliciting proxies for its board nominees he said state 
insurance law forbids a company from seeking to control a tennessee 
company without prior approval of the state department of commerce 
and insurance 
but attorney william leech said torchmark simply wants five 
directors on the american general board who will listen to 
discussions about merging the two companies he said election of 
onethird of the directors falls short of a takeover 
tennessee is one of 10 states in which american general is 
considered domiciled because of operations there regulators in 
texas and new york as well as tennessee have questioned the 
legality of torchmarks proxy solicitation missouri california 
and virginia have approved the process

smirnoff the vodka favored by czars that 
was banished during the russian revolution is back in the ussr 
heublein inc said wednesday it has taken advantage of easing 
eastwest trade restraints to ship smirnoff back to the soviet 
union where it was first distilled in the 1800s 
heublein a liquor and wine company based in farmington has 
been bottling vodka under the smirnoff name in the united states 
for more than 50 years acquiring the formula from russian exiles 
in the 1930s 
peter smirnoff first distilled his vodka in 1818 in moscow and 
through the century became the official supplier of vodka and 
liqueurs to the court of imperial russia heublein spokeswoman 
vivian brooks said 
but the bolshevik party led by vladimir i lenin took control 
of the government in 1917 and moscows businesses and industries 
were seized by the red army 
vladimir smirnoff then running the family distillery was 
jailed and sentenced to death as a symbol of czarist oppression 
smirnoff was rescued by the white army which represented the 
nobility and others opposing the revolution and made his way to 
france in the early 1930s he sold the family formula to rudolph 
kunett another russian exile 
kunett made his way to the united states and set up a vodka 
distillery in bethel later selling the operation to heublein in 
1939 
selling vodka to the soviets might seem a bit like the old joke 
about selling refrigerators to eskimos or bringing coals to 
newcastle but brooks said that from a lifestyle point of view 
russians look to smirnoff as an american symbol which in a way is 
ironic 
heublein launched an advertising campaign tuesday with the theme 
back in the ussr 
the new advertisement is our way of toasting the new openness 
in eastwest relations said charles traynor vice president of 
marketing for heubleins john g martin unit martin bought the 
smirnoff formula and rights for heublein in 1939

braniff inc hopes to gain at least 50 
million from the sale of aircraft contracts pay off some of its 
debts and wrap up bankruptcy proceedings soon officials say 
the airline has asked a federal bankruptcy judge for 
authorization to sell contracts to purchase 24 airbus a320 jets 
plus its options to buy 50 more planes and spare parts 
if permission is granted lawyers say most of the proceeds 
would be used to pay debts another 11 million may come from 
auctions of groundsupport equipment and other assets in orlando 
dallas and kansas city mo 
no hearing has yet been scheduled on braniffs request 
preliminary estimates indicate that braniffs creditors might 
get 10 cents or less for each dollar they are owed the airlines 
estimated total debt is 450 million 
orlandobased braniff filed for chapter 11 protection from 
creditors last sept 28 since then it has halted operations 
dismissed most of its 4800 employees and disposed of most of its 
assets 
the contracts and options to purchase the jets which have been 
in dispute with the aircraft manufacturers are considered 
braniffs most valuable assets 
the prospective buyers are avsa sarl and airbus service co 
inc both affiliates of airbus industrie the european consortium 
that manufactures the aircraft as part of the agreement those 
companies and braniff would settle lawsuits against each other 
the creditors are pleased with the proposal and hope that its 
a beginning for an even higher offer said harry lewis a new 
york lawyer representing the unsecured creditors committee 
commenting on the possibility of a 10cent return for each 
dollar of debt lewis said tuesday that was average but a heck 
of a lot better than zero and we were looking at getting nothing 
back earlier in this case

now that most major companies rely heavily on 
computers the next step in the computerization of industry 
involves getting these computers to talk with each other 
such linkups among computers at different companies are called 
electronic data interchange or edi though edi has been around for 
years it has yet to become widespread outside of a few industries 
but once it does us industry could save billions of dollars a 
year experts say 
edi systems can automate much of the routine business between 
companies and their customers and suppliers electronic messages 
passed between computers can replace purchase orders bills of 
lading shipping slips and other paperwork 
we know in 10 years this is going to be the way companies 
operate said thomas p colberg an edi consultant at price 
waterhouse a large new york accounting firm 
one leading edi user is levi strauss amp co the san 
franciscobased jeans maker 
through edi a computer at a retail store can automatically 
reorder goods from levis based on what has been sold in turn a 
computer at levis automatically ships the goods and bills the 
store for the items little or no human intervention is required 
edi also can be linked to an automatic payment technique called 
electronic funds transfer through such a system for example 
sears roebuck and co pays for shipments from levis by having its 
computer automatically credit a levis bank account 
soon levis plans to add another layer of edi in which its 
computers will automatically reorder raw materials such as fabric 
and thread based on the orders from retailers 
its as if that entire chain the retailer the manufacturer 
and the supplier to the manufacturer as if they are one company 
the consumer buys and it goes right through to the manufacturer 
said paul benchener who is in charge of levis edi system 
its exciting its changing the way that business will be 
done in the future he said 
edi is not the same as electronic mail in which a computers 
human users send electronic messages to each other with edi the 
need for humans is greatly reduced 
edi slashes the time required to reorder goods and because 
goods arrive more quickly it can dramatically reduce the amount of 
goods that must be kept on hand in warehouses 
the technology also virtually eliminates the errors that can 
crop up when orders are entered into computers by hand 
at levi strauss computers order up production of jeans at the 
companys plants to match incoming orders because of the precision 
in ordering jeans levis can order the exact amount of cloth 
zippers and thread needed to make jeans to replace those just 
shipped 
that has allowed levis to drastically reduce the amount of 
supplies stored at sewing plants in some cases we dont have any 
supply on hand benchener said 
in turn some levis customers have been able to sharply reduce 
their storage space devoted to jeans and other items because of the 
speed and precision with which they can get new supplies delivered 
the ability to quickly reorder popular items in the mostwanted 
sizes and colors is a particular benefit to retailers benchener 
said 
these delivery techniques called justintime inventory control 
or quick response were popularized by japanese manufacturers 
sears says that due mostly to edi the retailer has reduced the 
storage space in newer stores to 20 percent of total area vs 50 
percent once set aside for storage 
we no longer are going to be using the stores as warehouses 
said lance dailey who runs sears edi operation 
the savings in paperwork have been just as dramatic dailey said 
about half our invoices are electronic it would be reasonable 
to expect that if we didnt have edi wed have to have double the 
staff to process our invoices he said 
benchener said levi strauss implemented edi more as a way to 
boost sales than to cut costs but the company has benefited in 
both areas the main advantage is that it freed up much of the time 
salespeople once spent completing customer orders by hand 
what weve done is increased our sales but with the same 
number of sales reps benchener said 
about 40 percent of levis orders now come in electronically he 
said 
one hurdle in establishing an edi system is getting companies 
accustomed to the idea of paying for goods without a slip of paper 
or invoice proving they received them said colberg this practice 
is upsetting to some accountants and auditors who like to have 
paper receipts to verify accounts 
david atlas an analyst at international data corp said 
concern about paper documents may be misplaced just because you 
have something electronically doesnt also mean you cant have 
paper copies he said 
in addition electronic transactions usually are recorded on 
magnetic tape or computer discs 
a bigger obstacle preventing more widespread adoption of edi is 
that industry has yet to agree on a standard for the systems said 
guy fisher edi marketing manager for general electric cos ge 
information services the nations largest edi network 
as a result he said incompatible edi systems are used meaning 
a company using one system usually cant exchange electronic 
documents with a company using another without first translating it 
through special computer software 
analysts said edi has gained wide acceptance in a few 
industries such as aerospace autos retailing pharmaceuticals 
oil and banking but when compared with the overall volume of 
routine business transactions edi remains a small fraction 
input a mountain view calif market research firm says the 
domestic edi market totaled about 280 million last year including 
fees for use of edi networks related software and professional 
services input projects the market will grow about 40 percent a 
year through 1994 
inputs figures do not include the inhouse edi systems 
established by the three major automakers and several large 
retailers 
fisher predicts the next major industry that will adopt edi 
widely is transporatation and shipping he said the paperbased 
system this industry uses is a monstrosity that could be 
substantially streamlined through edi

eastman kodak co said wednesday its 
firstquarter earnings dipped 6 percent while sales fell slightly 
kodak chairman colby h chandler said he still expects to see 
positive results from the companys major restructuring last year 
in the second half of 1990 
barring unexpected developments in the economy we believe the 
recovery forecast for kodak will come about chandler said 
a strong showing by kodaks core imaging segment was offset by 
lower profits in its chemicals and information segments the 
company said 
while firstquarter results were slightly below those reported 
at this time last year they are consistent with the companys 
business plan for 1990 which calls for higher sales and earnings 
for the full year he said 
income for the quarter ending march 31 was 199 million or 61 
cents per share compared to 212 million or 65 cents per share 
in the first quarter of 1989 
sales for the first quarter dipped 2 percent to 41 billion 
from 42 billion in the same period last year chandler said sales 
would have been about level if an extra week of business activity 
had been excluded from the first quarter of 1989 
figures for 1989 were restated to reflect the companys change 
from a 13period to a 12month calendar year 
the rochesterbased photographic giant began a 549 million 
restructuring in 1989 selling or consolidating about 20 businesses 
and eliminating 7500 jobs 
chandler has said he expects to see the restructuring translate 
into better earnings and improved cash flows in the second half of 
1990 
david nelson an industry analyst with shearson lehman hutton 
inc in new york said the firstquarter drop was not unexpected 
the numbers are mixed but on balance positive nelson said 
the improvements from last years restructuring have not hit the 
income statement yet 
in the first quarter kodak margins held steady cash flow was 
positive and debt was reduced chandler said 
earnings improved by more than 50 percent in the companys core 
imaging segment because of lower operating costs and higher prices 
profits dropped 38 percent in the chemicals segment and 20 percent 
in the information segment 
chandler blamed the decline in chemicals earnings on high raw 
material costs and a power outage that shut down the companys 
kingsport tenn plant temporarily 
the information segment was affected by a soft us market for 
business equipment he said health segment earnings declined 3 
percent for the quarter

grain and soybean futures prices closed sharply 
higher wednesday on the chicago board of trade boosted in part by 
prospects of new wheat sales to china 
the agriculture department announced wednesday morning it had 
targeted china for sales of 2 million metric tons of us wheat at 
subsidized prices 
the wheat market also was supported by concerns that heavy rains 
in texas and oklahoma could cause winter wheat harvest delays and 
crop losses analysts said 
but there was no fresh supplyanddemand news behind the rally 
in the soybean and corn markets which advanced amid heavy 
speculative fund buying linked to bullish chart patterns

higher with the contract for delivery in may at 373 a bushel 
corn was 2 cents to 4 cents higher with may at 288 a bushel

since 1936 when he rose to the 
formidable position as union boss in this border city businesses 
and politicians have sought favor with agapito gonzalez cavazos 
a big jowly potbellied man who charms unionists with his 
charisma and brags about his fourthgrade education gonzalez 
remains steadfast in the role of workingclass advocate 
he dresses simply in faded clothes and describes the 
labormanagement relationship in the same rhetoric as five decades 
ago an usandthem struggle 
the 74yearold regional general secretary of the confederation 
of mexican workers says he takes his orders from the workers whom 
he calls los muchachos or the youngsters rankandfile 
union members respond with don agapito a title of respect reserved 
for the elderly 
but operators of matamoros mostly usowned assembly plants 
known as maquiladoras describe gonzalez as an example of an 
influential labor leader who has lost track of the times a relic 
on a collision course with president carlos salinas de gortaris 
effort to reform and modernize mexicos economy 
gonzalez who controls the labor supply for the plants says he 
doesnt trust the maquiladora plants historicaly one of the 
fastest growing areas of us business expansion into mexico the 
plants assemble everything from computer disks to cassette tapes to 
automobile windshield wiper blades 
they come to exploit us gonzales said they do not come 
to help us 
yet there are indications the mexican government wants to 
throttle gonzalez and mexicos other labor bosses or caciques 
a mexican term meaning chieftains 
last year in ciudad madero about 250 miles down the coast from 
matamoros mexican troops blasted their way into a house to arrest 
oil union chief joaquin hernandez galicia on corruption charges 
later in the year in reynosa about 50 miles west of matamoros 
state and federal governments helped rival union organizer abel 
hernandez successfully challenge wouldbe cacique rafael morales 
who wanted his local to hold a monopoly on the citys maquiladora 
workers 
in january when gonzalez threatened strikes that could have 
idled up to 60000 workers at maquiladoras and related industries 
around matamoros the government allowed the talks to move to 
mexico city without gonzalezs participation 
the companies won concessions allowing them to move equipment to 
and from their plants and to discipline workers without union 
permission pay raises were held to 15 percent instead of the 25 
percent the union had demanded 
two weeks later auditors from the treasury department in mexico 
city showed up at gonzalez headquarters and took a truckload of 
files back to the capital treasury officials refused to discuss 
why but the move raised speculation the government might use the 
threat of investigation to keep gonzales in line 
the federal government is really fed up with this guy because 
of the harassment hes given our companies and the bad name hes 
given mexico in general said jim ebersole industrial 
development director with the economic development council in 
brownsville texas across the rio grande from matamoros 
the labor leader and his defenders maintain that workers are 
getting squeezed in inflationracked mexico 
a modernization requires a modernization of salaries also 
said vicente sanchez an economics researcher at the colegio 
frontera del norte in matamoros who will negotiate for the 
workers if not the labor leaders 
industrial managers say gonzalez tactics drive away those who 
would open new plants in matamoros 
you know what the muchachos say gonzalez responded let 
them leave because we dont want them here we wont put up with 
them any more 
most mexican workers at the plants spend an entire day earning 
what us employees make in an hour he said 
joe lacambra president of managements matamoros maquiladora 
association blamed gonzalez and higherthanaverage wages for the 
citys failure to attract any major new company in 1989 
including benefits an average matamoros maquiladora worker 
makes about 230 an hour lacambra said compared to about 150 
an hour in the mexican states of baja california norte and 
chihuahua 
matamoros maquiladora workers also receive 56 hours pay if they 
show up for 40 hours in a week lacambra said although workers at 
maquiladoras in other border areas have to work 48 hours to get the 
56 hours of pay 
if the wages are too high like they are in matamoros the 
companies are going to go somewhere else said tito torres a 
mcallen texas attorney who for 18 years has represented such us 
companies as zenith electronics corp and american telephone amp 
telegraph co in their business dealings in mexico 
torres said clients have reported numerous incidents of union 
harassment in matamoros those included refusal to allow companies 
to remove equipment for repairs work stoppages staged apparently 
when gonzalez felt management slighted him and an instance when 
the union threatened a strike if a company did not withdraw theft 
accusations against four employees and a plant manager 
in another case torres said the union tried to force a company 
to buy unionowned equipment it did not need 
but the business climate has improved recently said torres 
crediting president salinas with bringing union caciques under 
control 
im hopeful that they are because theyre not the new 
mexico torres said the last vestige of the old mexico is in 
the labor area 
part of the union bosses power lies in the labor federations 
position as a wing of the official institutional revolutionary 
party that maintains oneparty rule at the national level people 
like gonzalez are responsible for trucking in hundreds or thousands 
of union members to party rallies 
gonzalez himself served two terms in the federal chamber of 
deputies 
but lately he hasnt been able to bring out the vote like 
before and the opposition authentic party of the mexican 
revolution has won the matamoros mayoral race twice in 10 years 
due partly to the growth of political opposition in mexico 
the labor leader said his role is to defend workers not 
politicians 
i have people who work all the time and barely subsist 
gonzalez said

in a sign of improved economic activity the 
government said wednesday that its chief forecasting gauge surged 
in march to the largest gain in more than a year 
basically the message is the economy is showing signs the 
worst is behind it said robert g dederick chief economist with 
the northern trust co in chicago 
the commerce department reported that its index of leading 
economic indicators rose 09 percent in march nearly offsetting 
the 1 percent decline in february it was the steepest increase 
since a 16 percent gain in june 1988 
the index is designed to forecast economic activity six to nine 
months ahead 
the index is hinting at a takeoff for the economy later this 
year from an anemic growth pattern of the fourth quarter of 1989 
and the first quarter of 1990 said allen sinai chief economist 
with the boston co 
but dederick said the economy was not prepared to suddenly go 
off on a spree 
sinai said any progress could be dampened if the federal reserve 
decided to boost interest rates further to curb rising inflation 
high rates would slow further what has been sluggishness in the 
auto construction and industrial sectors of the economy 
in another report wednesday the commerce department pointed to 
other signs of improvement in the industrial sector saying that 
orders to factories for manufactured goods rose 38 percent in 
march 
the march gain was the largest in more than a year and together 
with februarys 18 percent advance offset januarys 55 percent 
decline the biggest fall since a 7 percent decrease in december 
1974 
the increase in the leading indicators was a big one 
widespread solidly based sinai said if more occurs in coming 
months it means the economy will do well later in the year 
six of the 11 forwardlooking statistics contributed to the 
increase in the leading indicators led by a gain in new plant and 
equipment orders 
other contributors included an increase in the price of raw 
materials an increase in orders for consumer goods higher stock 
prices slower business delivery times and a drop in weekly 
unemployment claims 
negatives included a decrease in building permits a decline in 
the backlog of manufacturers unfilled orders and a drop in the 
money supply 
two of the components were unchanged the average work week and 
an index measuring consumer confidence 
the various changes left the index at 1452 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 the index edged up 01 percent from october through 
march on top of a 02 percent gain the previous six months 
lawrence a hunter deputy chief economist with the us chamber 
of commerce called the report an encouraging sign that the 
economy will rebound from its dismal performance of the last two 
quarters but suggested it should be kept in perspective 
even though the increase was larger than any monthly rise we 
have seen in more than a year and a half the index remains just 
about where it stood a year ago he said 
the index was 1458 in april 1989

rh macy inc says its sales remained flat 
during the most recent quarter but the retailer was able to trim 
its losses from a year earlier 
in a letter to investors released wednesday macys executives 
said the retail climate remained nonbuoyant as anticipated 
in the third quarter ended april 28 
without specifying how much the company lost during the quarter 
a macys spokeswoman said it was less than the 64 million lost on 
sales of 15 billion in the yearago period figures for the third 
quarter are expected to be released in midjune 
the letter signed by macys three topranking executives said 
the company cut its merchandise receipts by 250 million from 
yearearlier levels a move that helped reduce the companys 
seasonal working capital needs 
the retailer which went private in a leveraged buyout in 1986 
is dependent on its cash flow to pay the remaining debt from the 
buyout 
industry observers while hesitant to comment about macys 
financial health without specific figures said lower inventory 
levels were a step in the right direction 
we are in a very conservative and frugal shopping climate and 
to enter the spring season with conservative stock levels is the 
right thing to do said kurt barnard new yorkbased consultant 
and publisher of the retail marketing report 
lower inventory levels mean there is far less of a chance 
theyll have to promote like hell to get rid of merchandise 
barnard said 
but because macys is hardpressed for cash to pay down debt 
levels it is not at all clear they will be able to escape the 
promotional activity they are seeking to rid themselves of 
barnard said 
macys like all retailers does not want to become dependent 
upon pricecutting and other promotions to keep merchandise moving 
the company lost 39 million in the previous quarter because it was 
forced to mark down merchandise to compete with price cutting at 
department stores owned by campeau corp which entered bankruptcy 
court protection 
the letter said macys expects its fourth quarter results to be 
similar to the third quarter although there should be volume 
increases resulting from an expanded storewide preseason sale in 
july 
rumors have circulated in the industry that macys might be 
forced to sell off some assets to cover its debt payments but a 
macys spokeswoman called the talk just rumors 
besides its flagship macy stores located mainly in the east and 
texas the company owns i magnin and bullocks stores in 
california and the west it also owns specialty stores including 
charter club and aeropostale which are stocked with macys private 
label apparel brands

the pension of departing general motors corp 
chairman roger b smith could double under a proposal that could 
add 42 million to the automakers costs for executive pensions in 
its first year alone 
the proposal up for the vote of shareholders at gms annual 
meeting may 25 would base pensions for gms top 3350 executives 
on an average of total cash compensation rather than just salary 
the proposal comes during an aggressive costcutting campaign 
adopted in 1987 aimed at cutting up to 13 billion from the 
automakers costs by the end of this year 
the shareholders meeting in detroit will be the last one chaired 
by smith whose nineyear tenure has been criticized for focusing 
too much on financial matters and too little on developing new cars 
and trucks 
united auto workers president owen bieber on wednesday 
criticized the pension change as unjustifiable 
in view of gms largess to its executives there will be no 
excuse for the corporation to be less than fully responsive to the 
needs of our older members and retirees bieber said there are 
about 400000 retired uaw members 
the uaw is to begin contract bargaining with gm in july the 
current pact expires sept 14 
gm executives pensions now are based on a formula keyed to 
their average salaries in the past 10 years under the proposed 
system bonuses would be included in the formula 
last year smiths 11 million salary grew to 26 million with 
bonuses stock options and other compensation 
smith who retires aug 1 stands to see his annual pension rise 
to 11 million from about 550000 under the new plan 
ford motor co and chrysler corp base their executives 
pensions on salary alone ford also has the option of giving the 
executives added annuities 
there is a growing movement in the uaw to add costofliving 
allowances to hourly worker pension plans such a proposal which 
analysts have said would be extremely costly was turned down at a 
recent meeting of the uaw skilled trades department 
the issue is likely to attract a good deal of attention when the 
uaw holds a threeday bargaining convention in kansas city 
beginning may 21 
executive salaries bonuses and retirement packages have 
prompted harsh criticism from the uaw in the past 
its outrageous ridiculous said whitey hale a member of 
uaw local 326 in flint who is a leader in the movement for 
costofliving increases for retirees how can they turn their 
back on our members that actually made the money to give 
themselves the bonuses 
theyll get that every year a million dollars and our people 
are getting 1500 a month he said 
smith will be succeeded by gm president robert stempel who came 
up through the companys engineering and marketing ranks his move 
into the chairmanship was praised by analysts who had criticized 
smith 
when smith became chairman on new years day 1981 gms share of 
the us car and truck market stood at 441 percent at the end of 
last year its share was 346 percent 
also during smiths tenure the automaker took a back seat in 
profits to smaller ford motor co last year gm regained the title 
as the nations most profitable automaker

american general corp surprised shareholders and 
one suitor wednesday by putting itself up for sale in an auction 
expected to fetch 7 billion for the nations fourth largest 
insurance company 
the companys stock price jumped sharply higher after the 
announcement at american generals annual shareholders meeting 
where the anticipated event had been a showdown with hostile suitor 
torchmark corp 
harold s hook american generals chairman said the company 
decided to put itself up for auction because it was vulnerable to a 
possible takeover at a discount price and wanted to realize the 
maximum value for its stockholders 
american general finished up 750 at 4762 a share as the 
most actively traded issue on the new york stock exchange 
company officials and analysts said they expected the bidding 
for american general to reach about 7 billion or more than 55 
per share 
birmingham alatorchmark had made an unsolicited 634 
billion or 50 per share cash and stock buyout offer for american 
general in march but torchmark later withdrew the offer opting 
instead to wage a proxy fight to elect its own five nominees to the 
15member board 
since then each company vigorously has been urging shareholders 
to support its board nominees torchmark also asked shareholders to 
approve two resolutions calling for american general to hire an 
investment banking firm and to appoint a committee of independent 
directors to evaluate acquisition proposals 
we are confident we elected our slate of directors hook 
said to the loud applause of the 650 shareholders attending the 
meeting 
i wish that was the end of the story he added before 
reading a statement announcing the sale 
torchmark chairman ron richey said he was pleased with american 
generals announcement 
from the outset our objective has been to negotiate a 
transaction with american general and we look forward to sitting 
down with them to discuss a merger proposal richey said based 
on todays announcement regardless of the proxy vote we intend to 
make another proposal to combine torchmark with american general 
the decision to sell the company was made about 6 pm tuesday 
in a meeting with the entire board hook said he would not say if 
the boards decision was unanimous 
the sale announcement could not be made public until the 
companys proxy vote had ended he said 
american general has subsidiaries that operate in 50 states and 
canada the muchsmaller torchmark is best known for its liberty 
national mutual insurance subsidiary 
american general has assets of 32 billion torchmark has assets 
of 5 billion 
hook said the board would rather sell the company in one piece 
but would be prepared to sell off operating subsidiaries separately 
if that wasnt possible 
asked if torchmarks original offer was adequate hook said a 
50 a share offer would be considered a discount price 
he said he expects about 50 potential bidders initially first 
boston corp will lead the companys selling effort 
analyst hebert goodfriend with prudential bache research in new 
york said he believed several companies would be interested in 
american general but would not name any 
torchmarks adamant interest in acquiring american general 
made a lot of other people aware that we were vulnerable hook 
said he said many companies have called wanting to discuss the 
situation but reiterated that the company was not in search of a 
white knight to thwart the bid 
the outcome of wednesdays proxy vote will not be known for up 
to two weeks said american general spokesman john pluhowski

president carlos salinas de gortari sent a 
proposal to congress today to modify the constitution and 
reestablish a private banking system in mexico the government 
announced 
former president jose lopez portillo nationalized the countrys 
35 private banks shortly before leaving office in 1982 claiming 
that bankers had helped mexicans take money out of the country 
worsening an economic recession 
once again there would be mixed banking private banks and 
public owned banks said leonardo ffrench a presidential 
spokesman 
the bill would allow 100 percent private ownership of commercial 
banks 
a change in social realities in the country in economic 
structures of the states role in the financial system change the 
circumstances that brought about the nationalization of banks a 
government statement said 
we cannot allow a state as owner with so many resources 
invested in banking in a country with so many urgent social 
needs it said the government could take advantage of its 
funds and free its resources to assist infrastructure and services 
which are the essential role of the state 
a constitutional change must be approved by twothirds of the 
500member congress that would require a coalition between the 
governing institional revolutionary party and opposition parties 
mexicos 1917 constitution had decreed a mixed banking system

a growing number of major insurers are 
slashing or abandoning personal lines of insurance because of what 
they call declining profits and increased meddling by state 
regulators and lawmakers 
insurance industry analysts say this reduction could spell 
serious trouble for consumers who need automobile homeowners and 
health policies some may be unable to find coverage 
xerox corps crum and forster insurance division announced last 
month that it was exiting the personal insurance market altogether 
joining at least seven others who have reduced or eliminated their 
personal insurance offerings 
those include travelers corp aetna life and casualty co and 
the hartford insurance group in the nations insurance capital 
philadelphiabased cigna corp the new hampshire insurance group 
and continental corp in new york 
insurance executives center much of their frustration on the 
regulation of auto insurance many blame laws such as californias 
proposition 103 which would place restrictions on auto insurance 
premiums and new jerseys new law effectively reducing auto 
insurance premiums 20 percent for the withdrawal from personal 
insurance 
you take any business in any industry and you tell them they 
cant make any money you dont have to be in insurance to know 
what the business will do said david seifer a researcher who 
follows the insurance industry for donaldson lufkin amp jenrette a 
new york investment firm 
its price setting by the legislature said robert brian a 
vice president of hartfordbased conning and co a research firm 
theres only one result and thats total economic chaos the 
arithmetic just doesnt add up theyre destroying the personal 
insurance market 
california new jersey nevada pennsylvania and south carolina 
have all passed laws mandating some sort of a rate rollback the 
massachusetts legislature has been criticized for setting what 
industry experts say are artificially low rates 
on april 30 aetna sued massachusetts claiming a provision of 
the state law that penalizes insurers who want to stop selling auto 
policies there is unconstitutional and amounts to extortion 
there have been threats of rate rollbacks in connecticut and at 
least 15 other states said terry tyrpin assistance vice president 
with the american association of independent insurers an 
illinoisbased group 
joan bianca a crum and forster spokeswoman said regulatory 
restrictions were largely responsible in the companys decision 
threequarters of the companys business is done in states 
undergoing insurance reforms 
hartfordbased travelers corp has withdrawn from the automobile 
insurance field in california affecting 18000 customers the 
company also has stopped writing new policies in new jersey and is 
carefully choosing customers in other states 
the business is extremely competitive profits are very slim 
so we are concentrating on areas we feel are more viable to us 
said dan kaferle a spokesman for travelers we dont see a 
bright future in a business with regulations restricting price 
kaferle said travelers predicted it would have lost about 20 
million between 1989 and 1991 in california where rates have been 
frozen at 1989 levels as lawmakers study proposed legislation the 
company also predicted losses in pennsylvania where auto insurance 
reform is underway 
travelers has also stopped selling new individual majormedical 
health insurance policies 
aetna is scaling down in states where profits are poor the 
company has dropped some independent agents and reduced 
commissions aetna plans to reduce personal auto insurance business 
by 20 percent over the next three years the company also will stop 
selling new individual health insurance policies in may 
the company wrote 18 billion in premiums in 1989 and lost more 
than 80 million said spokesman john hawkins 
weve not thrown in the towel completely said hawkins 
but weve made the decision that we are not going to grow the 
business in those states where we are unprofitable 
insurance analysts say the trend was predictable especially in 
the deteriorating auto insurance field where some states have 
regulated premiums to what the industry calls an unprofitable 
level more companies feeling the squeeze are expected to follow 
suit 
its just the beginning said brian theyve just finally 
run out of hope the multiline companies have decided that they 
cant be everything to everybody 
industry experts say the upheaval means many consumers will find 
it tougher to buy individual health insurance or insurance for 
their cars and homes especially in states where regulation of 
insurance rates is especially stiff or where legislation is pending 
moreover as companies cut back and competition decreases so 
will the quality of insurance said larry kibbee a vice president 
with the alliance of american insurers an insurance industry 
lobbying group 
analysts predict that many consumers will have to fall back on 
substandard insurers getting claims processed may become a 
consumer nightmare they say 
others predict increased rates for some consumers especially in 
states with no restrictions as insurers raise rates to offset 
losses in other areas where rates are regulated 
industry executives assert that the state regulations attack the 
symptom rather than the causes of high rates which they blame on 
problems ranging from fraudulent claims to the high cost of repairs 
and litigation 
legislators are going to have to look more at some of the root 
causes as to why the rates are as high as they are especially in 
the auto insurance industry said kibbee 
last year the alliance did a survey and found for example that 
it cost 60000 for replacement parts for a 1989 nissan maxima with 
a 17000 sticker price said kibbee 
the washingtonbased american insurance association an industry 
lobbying group has been pushing for better laws to keep insurance 
claims out of court dave snyder an official of the organization 
said hefty attorney fees have pushed up insurance rates 
tremendously 
he suggested other solutions like capping medical fees 
increasing automobile safety standards and cracking down on 
traffic violators to reduce accidents 
quick fix solutions like rate roll backs is not going to 
help said terri malenfant a spokeswoman for the alliance of 
american insurers the only way is to hold down the costs of 
repairs medical costs and litigation costs 
kaferle of travelers said artificially low rates will hurt the 
consumer in the long run 
if you hold down those rates for no other reason other than to 
hold down rates eventually all those costs will have to catch up 
with the consumers and they are going to have a major rate shock 
he said

undaunted by a 2monthold strike greyhound lines 
inc on wednesday unveiled a summer radio advertising campaign 
touting bus travel as a window seat on america 
greyhound also announced a reduced fare program for some 
northeast and midwest markets where recovery has been lagging 
the dallasbased company which operates the only nationwide bus 
system was struck by 6500 drivers and some 3000 clerical and 
maintenance employees march 2 the company and union said wednesday 
they would resume negotiations saturday in washington 
greyhound spokeswoman liz hale said that although the company 
has been operating reduced schedules during the strike recent 
expansions have restored service to about 869 percent of 
prestrike locations further expansions are planned as the busy 
summer traveling season approaches 
the ad campaign ignores the strike instead stressing service 
were offering so much service now ms hale said the 
strike has not hampered our ability to bring back service to most 
markets that we were serving before the strike started so most of 
our passengers are finding that they can go to their destinations 
about 35 million passengers have ridden greyhound since the 
strike began in recent days loads have been running between 53 
percent and 58 percent of the same day last year the company said 
union officials have disputed greyhounds figures on restored 
service putting it at about 20 percent of prestrike levels 
the union claims greyhound faces a mounting cash crunch the 
company created through a 1987 leveraged buyout has a 9 million 
interest payment due may 15 greyhound has said it will be able to 
make the payment 
ms hale citing company policy would not disclose the cost of 
the ad campaign 
greyhounds past owners have used television campaigns but ms 
hale said the current owners have used radio exclusively because 
it fits our demographics greyhound says its passengers tend to 
be students or from lowincome families 
the campaign which debuts monday and is to run through august 
features three versions of a jingle the ads will run on nationwide 
networks serving more than 3000 stations and in 11 large 
metropolitan areas 
the jingle in gospel rock and blues versions urges travelers 
to take a window seat on america take a greyhound cruise dont 
need a lot of money to be traveling in style 
the reduced fare promotion puts a 99 cap on oneway fares with 
no advance purchase requirements the fare is good friday through 
june 13 and includes chicago plus connecticut maine 
massachusetts michigan new hampshire new jersey new york ohio 
pennsylvania rhode island and vermont 
greyhound also lowered round trip fares in a dozen new england 
markets 
the promotion is the second to target the northeast since the 
strike during the easter travel period greyhound offered free 
tickets in some markets if buses did not run on time

energy futures prices fell wednesday as opecs 
latest attempt to curb overproduction stalled 
the market moved higher in early trading on anticipation that an 
agreement to limit output might be reached but when traders heard 
reports that ministers meeting in geneva could not agree on how to 
allocate production cuts prices fell back 
the june contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
us crude oil slipped 13 cents to close at 1868 a 42gallon 
barrel after trading as high as 1910 early in the session 
home heating oil for june delivery fell 111 cents to 5186 
cents a gallon and june unleaded regular gasoline dropped 008 
cent to 6095 cents a gallon 
natural gas for june delivery rose to 1575 per million british 
thermal units from 1565 tuesday 
one delegate source at the geneva meeting said the organization 
of petroleum exporting countries ministers were far apart in their 
positions and no one idea emerged from the talks 
ministers held a full plenary session for about half an hour 
early wednesday afternoon and then broke up to negotiate in small 
groups in their hotel rooms 
but plans to resume the full session were postponed twice and 
then delayed until further notice to allow for further 
consultations among the ministers opec said 
andrew lebow an analyst with edampf man international futures 
inc said news of the postponement dashed the oil markets hopes 
for a quick agreement 
traders have been anxious for new production limits to support 
prices which have fallen 20 percent since january but analysts 
have doubted opec could achieve enough of a production cutback to 
have a significant impact on prices 
opec is producing an estimated 23 million to 24 million barrels 
a day well above its selfimposed ceiling of 221 million barrels 
a day the excess output came ahead of a seasonal drop in demand 
causing a glut on world markets

soybean futures prices resumed their 3monthold rally wednesday 
as traders ignored bearish supply factors and again took their cues 
from price movement charts that suggested the market had room to 
move higher 
grain futures also rose sharply on the chicago board of trade 
while on other markets oil copper and precious metal futures fell 
and most livestock and meat futures advanced 
soybean futures settled 6 cents to 9 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in may up 9 cents at 636 a bushel

373 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 4 cents higher with may at

168 a bushel 
the price of soybeans for nearterm delivery has risen about 15 
percent since jan 9 when the market began its climb from 553 a 
bushel 
the buying has been spurred at times by fundamental factors such 
as brazilian soybean harvesting delays and strong domestic demand 
for soybean meal 
but observers said the powerful advance of the past week 
totaling about 27 cents in the last six trading sessions has been 
led by speculators that trade according to their interpretation of 
price charts known as technical analysis 
based on the charts analysts said the market looked ripe for a 
rally wednesday after tuesdays modest decline funds operated by 
the big trading companies tudor investment corp and refco inc 
were said to be big buyers despite forecasts for beneficial rain in 
the midwestern corn and soybean belt and indications that the 
brazilian soybean harvest is advancing rapidly 
it was a purely chartdriven market said william 
biedermann director of research for allendale inc a chicagoarea 
trading firm 
if you want to come up with a fundamental reason youd have 
to dream something up like anticipation of adverse weather and 
stronger export demand but thats really fishing for something 
he said 
the wheat market was supported by some fundamental news the 
agriculture department announced wednesday morning that it had 
targeted china for sales of 2 million metric tons of us wheat at 
subsidized prices 
wheat futures also were boosted by concerns that heavy rains in 
texas and oklahoma could cause winter wheat harvest delays and crop 
losses analysts said 
oil futures dipped on the new york mercantile exchange erasing 
early gains after opec ministers meeting in geneva postponed a 
second full plenary session about ways to cut their oil production 
and raise crude oil prices 
the ministers meeting in emergency session were finding it 
difficult to agree on how much to trim production and how to 
allocate the cuts among cartel members sources told the associated 
press

lower with june at 1868 a barrel heating oil was 89 cent to

president carlos salinas de gortari on 
wednesday proposed a constitutional amendment to reopen banking to 
private ownership but said the government would retain some 
nationalized commercial banks 
the president said his proposal to congress for the amendment 
reflected the economic changes since president jose lopez portillo 
nationalized the nations 35 private banks in 1982 at the outset of 
mexicos financial crisis 
lopez portillo claimed the banks were helping mexicans get money 
out of the country worsening an economic recession 
circumstances have changed salinas said in a communique 
the development policies have been modified and transcendental 
transformations have been carried out in the economic structures 
the country has made an enormous effort to overcome the crisis 
and at the same time to respond to the challenges of the last 
decade of the 20th century to respond with justice to the demands 
of society and confront with sovereignty a transformed more 
competitive technologically revolutionized world of still 
uncertain perspectives 
since lopez portillo nationalized the banks the banking system 
has been reopened to 34 percent ownership by private investors 
independent government agencies or corporations a presidential 
spokeswoman said that under the salinas proposal 100 percent 
private ownership would be possible 
salinas bill faces a tougher time in congress than the 
constitutional amendment that allowed the nationalization 
in 1982 the institutional revolutionary party or pri held a 
twothirds majority in congress and rubberstamped presidential 
bills it lost that advantage in 1988 when salinas won by the 
slimmest presidential margin in the partys 60year history 
leftist parties which oppose salinas program to privatize 
stateowned industry and business quickly criticized the bill 
ricardo pascoe pierce of the democratic revolutionary party the 
largest leftist party said the proposal was a ploy to try to win 
popularity in national and foreign financial circles 
with 123 of the 500 seats in the lower house they could not 
defeat the bill but are likely to try to slow it down and arouse 
nationalistic sentiment 
support for the bill is likely from the probusiness national 
action party the pri reached a deal with the party in 1989 to pass 
electoral reforms 
salinas has sold or put up for sale major companies including 
the national airline steel mills and its stock in the telephone 
monopoly but he had not yet ventured into sectors set aside for 
the government in the constitution including banking oil and 
electricity 
he skirted the constitution in the petrochemical area 
reclassifying some basic petrochemicals to secondary thus allowing 
private and foreign investment 
salinas said many of mexicos social needs can be met with money 
the government no longer will spend on banking and with money 
raised by the sale of bank stock 
under the bill the state proposes that it not be the majority 
owner of each and every one of the banking institutions he said 
however it will retain a participation in commercial banking and 
will strengthen those institutions oriented to development of 
specific priority activities 
a presidential statement noted that france and portugal among 
other countries had made similar banking reforms and that eastern 
european countries were preparing similar changes 
salinas did not mention foreign banks and it was not immediately 
clear how or if they would be affected 
one foreign banker who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the proposal was very fuzzy and did not ensure that existing 
banks would be sold 
eduardo garcia suarez president of the national association of 
chambers of commerce said the country needs an exclusively 
private rather than mixed system to be able to compete 
internationally the government news agency notimex said

control data corps new chief executive told 
shareholders wednesday he has purged the computer company of 
bureaucracy wasteful spending and arbitrary bonuses 
at an annual meeting punctuated by shareholder criticism of 
multimilliondollar severance and retirement packages lawrence 
perlman said changes in the companys culture should lead to 
consistent profitability 
the control data of the past was not always a company that 
thought in terms of building shareholder value said perlman who 
became chief executive in january after the company posted a net 
loss of 680 million in 1989 
he said stockholders employees and customers have been asked to 
endure a great deal during the last five years in which the 
company lost 15 billion 
but perlman defended the companys board for signing a contract 
in 1986 that gave former company head robert price 531 million in 
severance retirement and bonus money price also will get 450000 
a year under a threeyear consulting contract and receive a 
300000 annual pension 
two shareholders took the floor at the meeting to criticize 
prices contract and previous large payouts to retiring senior 
executives 
im outraged said edward diesing a former control data 
employee who termed the compensation exorbitant payoffs and 
payola 
its called greed said diesing who was applauded by fellow 
shareholders there is way too much of this attitude in the us 
and quite possibly at control data what do you think happens to 
employees morale when these disturbing sins are reported 
perlman said prices contract was reasonable at the time it 
was signed four years ago but senior executives signing such 
agreements today are entitled to less he said 
for instance senior executives no longer are entitled to 
severance payments if they leave voluntarily perlman said 
price announced last month that he would not stand for 
reelection to the companys board of directors the company lost 
924 million during his fouryear reign 
perlman said all consulting contracts at the company are under 
review because some have been abused and he said no employees 
will receive bonus money unless they achieve profits for the 
company 
in some cases under the old bonus system payments were quite 
subjective he said i want people to be able to produce a 
number perlman said 
in his remarks to shareholders perlman made repeated references 
to control datas past once selfdescribed as the worlds most 
innovative company control data grew wildly and profited in the 
1960s and 70s before stumbling in the 80s 
buoyed by the large gross margins of the 1970s and the early 
1980s the company did not build into its culture the discipline of 
constant attention to controlling expenses and reducing costs 
perlman said 
he said corporate overhead was out of hand several years 
ago but has been controlled by a reduction in corporate staff to 
250 from about 3000 in 1985 
people are beginning to treat the companys money as if it 
were their own he said 
he also said investment decisions will be based on financial 
analysis and reasonable expectations of returns on investment not 
on hope not on emotion 
perlman and price last year shut down control datas 
supercomputer subsidiary eta systems at a cost about 335 million 
control data founder william c norris who headed the company 
until 1986 and still sits on the board of directors said he wasnt 
offended by perlmans portrayal of the companys past 
i didnt take it personally norris said after the meeting 
the company had problems from time to time the thing that hurt 
us more than anything else was the japanese 
analysts have predicted control datas net income for 1990 at 1 
a share to 150 a share perlman said he is not comfortable with 
the prediction beyond the midpoint of that range

former ashland oil co chairman orin atkins 
testified wednesday that he never personally benfited from a scheme 
to sell confidential ashland documents to irans national oil 
company 
atkins took the stand in the us district court trial of 
attorney charles barnett 38 of palm beach fla who is charged 
connection with the 1979 conspiracy atkins pleaded guilty to 
related charges last september and agreed to cooperate 
i never received any money from any iranian at any time 
atkins said 
in opening arguments monday assistant us attorney herve 
gouraiage described barnett as an instrumental player in the 
conspiracy to sell the documents to the iranian national oil 
company for use in a civil lawsuit against ashland 
barnett was the person who thoroughly familiarized himself 
with the contents of the stolen ashland documents so he could 
explain their usefulness to the iranians gouraiage said 
the papers dealt with the 1979 sale of 283 million of crude oil 
from the iranian company to a subsidiary of the kentucky oil 
concern ashland overseas trading ltd 
iran sued ashland in 1985 for not paying for the oil and 
ashland settled the case last year by agreeing to pay 325 million 
prosecutors said atkins initiated the plan in 1982 after being 
forced to resign his executive position in 1981 he continued to 
work for ashland as a highly paid consultant until 1984 
atkins in his guilty plea admitted that he improperly obtained 
259 corporate documents and tried to sell them to the iranians in 
return for a cut of any damages iran won in the lawsuit 
on the witness stand atkins said he and others involved in the 
deal also tried to sell his consulting services which would have 
involved identifying ashland employees who were potential witnesses 
in the lawsuit 
he said he met only once in 1982 with unofficial 
representatives of the iranian company atkins said negotiations 
with the iranians were handled by former ashland consultant roy 
furmark barnett and others 
furmark who also will testify pleaded guilty in the scheme in 
march he admitted showing some of the documents to representatives 
of the iranian company at a meeting in london 
atkins faces up to 10 years in prison and a 500000 fine when 
sentenced later this year for conspiracy and wire fraud 
the first witness at barnetts trial was dustan mccoy an 
ashland attorney who said the company had refused to pay iran for 
the oil because it believed iran had breached the contract 
barnetts attorney marvin segal told the jury in opening 
remarks that barnetts actions were part of a legal enterprise to 
help the iranian oil company collect the money it avowedly was 
owned 
the indictment against barnett said he atkins and others made 
numerous attempts to sell the documents to the iranians between 
1982 and 1988 prosecutors have not said whether the iranians 
bought any documents 
furmark was a marginal participant in the irancontra scandal 
and gave testimony during investigations by house and senate 
committees and special prosecutor lawrence walsh 
barnetts attorneys are seeking to obtain transcripts of 
furmarks testimony about the irancontra affair to use in 
barnetts defense 
us district judge john e sprizzo has said he will review the 
testimony before ruling on its admissibility as evidence

ford motor cos new president acknowledged 
wednesday that improvements in the auto industry have followed 
government regulations which were not always received gracefully by 
the industry 
philip e benton who became ford president and chief operating 
officer march 1 also said he expects the world auto industry in 10 
years to include only about a half dozen dominant companies down 
from about a dozen today 
critics of the us auto industry viewed us as fighting just 
about every regulatory initiative that washington and the state 
capitals could come up with in the 1960s and 1970s benton said 
in a speech we clearly gained a reputation for intransigence 
he said the industry often sought only to alter timetables or 
the stringency of particular standards and did not oppose the 
principles behind government initiatives 
automakers now have gone through a tough transition from 
focusing on consumers and competition to worrying about 
regulatory complexity and compliance he said and in some 
instances we didnt make it very gracefully 
but benton said ford is pleased with its progress in installing 
airbags manufacturing fullsized cars that get as much as 25 miles 
per gallon reducing auto exhaust emissions and beginning to phase 
out chlorofluorocarbons all the result of government regulation 
weve invested heavily and aggressively in the technology and 
human resources that have allowed us to come this far toward 
resolving environmental and safety concerns and were prepared to 
do our part in the future in cooperation with government benton 
said 
he said changes are creating a new world which will no longer be 
defined by military strength but by the economic strengths and 
interrelationships of north america europe and asia 
benton said he did not believe in japan bashing or in the 
habit of some to bash the home team 
but he said the us auto industry has been shaken up by the 
entry of japanese companies 
as a result the stability of the north american market once 
dominated by ford chrysler corp and general motors corp for 
the time being is gone and north america is up for grabs he 
said 
worldwide consolidation will likely occur with more 
partnerships purchases and absorptions he said he noted that 
chrysler bought american motors in 1987 general motors bought 
about half of saabs car business last year and this year ford 
bought jaguar while renault and volvo announced a farreaching 
alliance 
ford will be one of the surviving strong halfdozen companies 
benton said declining to predict who the others might be

mayor tom bradley on wednesday proposed 
mandatory conservation measures requiring all water customers to 
cut use by 10 percent from 1986 levels to cope with californias 
worsening drought 
the state is experiencing its fourth consecutive drought year 
and the situation is serious bradley said at a news conference 
at city hall 
the regional metropolitan water district which provides about 
half the water needed by 15 million people in southern california 
has forecast a 10 percent shortfall in its supplies this summer 
the citys department of water and power which is getting 60 
percent of its water supply from the metropolitan water district 
this year serves 34 million residents 
the mayors request was a judgment call said james f 
wickser the departments water chief available water supplies for 
the city appear adequate at least through december and consumption 
last month was 14 percent below april 1989 wickser said 
bradley said there is a need to step up a voluntary water 
conservation program in effect since 1988 
although the measures bradley proposed are the most restrictive 
since the states record drought of 1977 they pale in comparison 
to those in santa barbara where officials are trying to cut water 
use by 45 percent 
in a letter to the city council bradley sought changes in a 
1977 drought ordinance that set out five increasingly stringent 
steps for conservation 
council approval likely will take six weeks at least mayoral 
aides said 
we can no longer delay in informing the citizens of los 
angeles that because of the lengthy statewide drought we have no 
choice but to require waterreducing actions by every resident 
business and corporation bradley said in a statement 
council president john ferraro agreed that the measures are 
needed and said the proposal has already been scheduled for the 
appropriate council committee 
the twoyearold city drought ordinances first phase calls for 
a voluntary 10 percent cutback it forbids people from hosing down 
sidewalks and driveways and restaurants and hotels from routinely 
serving drinking water it has not been widely observed or 
enforced although the department of water and power reported total 
water use last summer fell about 8 percent 
commonplace first phase violations prompted the mayor to seek 
the mandatory 10 percent reduction aides said 
the mayor also recommended a ban on watering gardens and lawns 
between 10 am and 5 pm and prohibiting water from overflowing 
onto sidewalks or streets 
bradleys proosal would assess surcharge penalties for excess 
water use 
the bimonthly bill for an average residential customer who fails 
to cut water use by 10 percent would jump from about 50 to about 
70 on the first offense said john stodder a mayoral aide 
additional penalties would be heaped on customers who continue 
to use too much water including the installation of water flow 
restriction devices or a service shutoff for repeat offenders 
under existing law a city council resolution is needed to 
implement the penalty aspects of the conservation ordinance 
the mayor said that those who voluntarily have cut back 10 
percent of their 1986 water use when water was plentiful would 
not be required to make additional reductions
