us customs agents on friday unveiled a 
fortified tunnel under the usmexican border and said it had been 
used to smuggle at least a ton of cocaine into this country 
it was like something out of a james bond movie customs 
spokeswoman judy turner said 
the tunnel dubbed cocaine alley was about the length of a 
football field and 30 feet underground authorities said they said 
the smuggling operation included a warehouse and elaborate 
entryways on both sides of the border 
us authorities and mexican judicial police raided the tunnel 
late thursday using jackhammers and torches to break in said 
thomas mcdermott head of the us customs service in arizona law 
enforcement officers found about 25 to 30 pounds of marijuana but 
made no arrests 
mcdermott told reporters that us officials working with 
mexican judicial police arrested two men earlier this month in 
connection with the smuggling ring 
mcdermott said authorities also confiscated the agua prieta 
mexico house of businessman rafael francisco camarena and two of 
camarenas businesses douglas building supply co and douglas 
redimix concrete one entrance of the tunnel is in the house and 
the other end was in a warehouse on the us side of the border 
camarena was not in custody mcdermott declined to say whether 
there was a warrant for his arrest 
in mexico city the attorney generals office said two people 
were arrested in the house the attorney generals communique was 
unclear if those were the same people mentioned as arrested by us 
officials their names were withheld 
the northern end of the tunnel was in a douglas building 
warehouse built eight months ago about 200 feet north of the fence 
that divides the two cities it was just one block from the 
unmarked customs enforcement building and four blocks from the 
international port of entry 
mcdermott said that in camarenas house excavation was hidden 
in the family room beneath an 8by12foot concrete slab holding a 
pool table he said that when an operator turned a small mechanism 
shaped like a garden faucet a hydraulic lift boosted the slab 
with pool table about 5 feet into the air 
it was a tremendously sophisticated operation mcdermott 
said this the most unique smuggling operation i have ever come 
across 
the tunnel was 5 feet high 4 feet wide well lighted and lined 
with supports to prevent caveins authorities said at various 
points were compartments where up to 5 tons of drugs could be 
stashed 
smugglers used a cart to load cocaine and ferry it through the 
tunnel which was up to 40 feet below the surface on the mexican 
side and 30 feet on the us side officials said 
on a tour of the warehouse reporters were shown the northern 
entrance a grate which when lifted revealed a 7foot drop to a 
gangway about the size of a small bedroom that led to a 
30footdeep well down to the tunnel proper 
over the well was a pulley and hoist system apparently used to 
raise drug packages 
the entrance and well were lined with concrete block 
it was just an exceptionally professionally engineered 
tunnel ms turner said it was something that you and i in the 
ordinary world would only find in the movies 
the smugglers were probably also using the tunnel to transport 
profits back to mexico said drug enforcement administration agent 
gerard murphy 
mcdermott said it probably took several months and 15 million 
to 2 million to build the tunnel the house and the warehouse 
which provided cover for moving large amounts of dirt were built 
eight months ago 
mcdermott said a geological survey team found the tunnel through 
tests which detected an anomaly something below the ground that 
shouldnt be there further tests helped pinpoint the tunnel 
ms turner said customs agents who suspected the tunnels 
existence used aerial surveillance to track the shipment of 2258 
pounds of cocaine with an estimated street value of 102 million 
from douglas to a spot outside phoenix on may 11 
they confiscated the haul and arrested caesar thomas howard 44 
of mesa and joseph edward osborn 31 of tempe 
the cocaine was transported from the warehouse in a 
falsebottomed flatbed truck and had been destined for southern 
california mcdermott said 
he said authorities knew of no other tunnels but said they 
would be looking this investigation is far from being over 
mcdermott said

the reagan administration was accepting 
panamanian gen manuel noriegas assistance to the contra rebels in 
nicaragua amid mounting publicity about his involvement in drug 
trafficking according to oliver norths notebooks 
north a former national security council aide and thencia 
official duane clarridge on aug 24 1986 discussed a possible 
agenda for a proposed northnoriega meeting with 5 steps 
pertaining to how to clean up image norths notebooks state 
the clarridgenorth discussion followed reports in the new york 
times that noriega was involved in drug trafficking 
tell assistant secretary of state elliott abrams that 
noriega has asked for meeting with north re cleaning up 
image said a north notebook entry in the meeting with clarridge 
who then headed the cias counterterrorism section 
a sept 3 1986 meeting with state department and cia officers 
that focused on panama mentioned corruption drugsarms 
trafficking money laundering according to norths notebooks 
as revealed at norths irancontra trial last year noriega met 
north met on sept 22 1986 in london where the panamanian leader 
said he would sabotage nicaraguan facilities 
norths notes reflect that noriega offered to collect 
intelligence on an airport a refinery electric and telephone 
systems and puerto sandino one entry from the noriega meeting 
reads killed head of plo presumably palestine liberation 
organization in brt 
the plo entry appears under the abbreviation co presumably 
company with capabilities in counterterrorism and commando 
operations according to the notebook entry the entry then refers 
to a head of ops and the words betzar and yonis 
the north and noriega conversation also touched on what appears 
to be an idea for a school with courses for commandos and 
the desire to train experts with courses in booby traps 
night ops raids apparently for service in afghanistan 
some 1200 pages of north notebook entries heavily censored by 
the government were made available friday by a private research 
organization the national security archive 
president bush who was then vice president has said he did not 
know details of the covert sale of arms to iran until dec 20 
1986 and did not know of norths contra resupply operation while 
it was in operation 
but sources speaking on condition of anonymity said a federal 
grand jury was convened friday to continue the 3yearold criminal 
investigation of the irancontra affair with a focus on the 
precise roles of bush and former president reagan 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater asked for comment on 
bushs role said friday we have nothing to add this matter has 
been thoroughly investigated by congressional committees 
a north notebook entry from nov 25 1986 the day the affair 
became public refers to a telephone call to north from 
thennational security adviser john m poindexter and then states 
vp call peres israeli prime minister shimon peres 
the entry adds that the contra connection has been 
discovered and that it wd be best if israel wd accept that 
they were aware that some funds were diverted 
it is not known if any phone call between bush and peres was 
made that day or whether the possibility of making a call was 
brought up with bush 
but attorney general edwin meese iii in disclosing the 
diversion of iran arms sale profits to the contra aid effort put 
the responsibility partly on israel meese said iran arms sale 
money went directly from the israelis into bank accounts held by 
the contras 
meeses statements which he made after interviewing north and 
poindexter drew immediate complaints from the israeli government 
peres called meese later that day and said israel had not paid 
anything into any contra accounts peres indicated that israel 
was not going to take the blame for the diversion the 
congressional irancontra committees said in their final report in 
1987 
israel had made three arms deliveries to iran in 1985 with the 
blessing of the reagan administration and had charged far in excess 
of what had been paid the pentagon to replenish the arms shipped to 
iran 
the diversion apparently began with the november 1985 shipment 
of hawk antiaircraft missiles when unexpended funds wound up in 
accounts controlled by arms dealers richard secord and albert hakim

an air traffic controller says the government 
improperly removed him from his job because he started taking an 
antiaids drug 
ron wilkinson who worked at washington dulles international 
airport on friday accused the federal aviation administration of 
discrimination 
his union the national air traffic controllers association has 
filed a grievance contending that the presence of the human 
immunodeficiency virus hiv which causes aids or use of the drug 
azt should not disqualify a controller 
faa spokesman bob buckhorn said the agency has a policy of 
giving desk jobs to controllers who take azt out of concern that 
side effects might compromise their critical task of following 
aircraft on radar screens 
buckhorn declined to comment on wilkinsons case citing federal 
privacy laws but he said the faa is reexamining medical analysis 
of azt to see whether its policy should be reevaluated 
controllers found to carry the hiv virus but who do not take azt 
can continue to direct air traffic buckhorn said 
wilkinson 29 now living in fort lauderdale fla said he has 
been offered no new assignment and hasnt received any pay since 
february he took several months of leave some of it donated by 
other employees after faa doctors voided his medical certificate 
he said 
when youre not sick what do you do just sit and do 
nothing wilkinson asked he said he had no symptoms of aids 
itself 
jim morin counsel for the controllers union said federal 
guidelines require that the faa give wilkinson reasonable 
accommodation 
i think that there is some discrimination because of the 
nature of his condition morin said 
aids is an incurable fatal disease that attacks the bodys 
immune system rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases 
and infections 
president bush in march called on business executives not to lay 
off or fire people infected with or exposed to the virus they 
can serve many more productive years with no threat to you your 
other workers or your companies he said 
dr william reiter director of the center for special 
immunology in fort lauderdale where wilkinson is being treated 
said tests of patients on azt have shown no significant sleepiness 
dizziness or any other problems that might hinder their work as 
controllers 
in some cases he said patients given a placebo showed more 
side effects than those given azt and he said new studies have 
failed to find any impact on the nervous system from the presence 
of hiv virus 
azt originally known as azidothymidine but now called 
zidovudine is the only drug approved for antiviral treatment of 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
wilkinson said he was an air force controller for eight years 
he said he worked for the faa at dulles in a virginia suburb 
outside washington for 21 months and had expected to qualify as a 
toplevel controller in about a year 
wilkinson was interviewed by telephone after a report on his 
case by washingtons wusatv 
on friday wusa reporter kent jarrell interviewed another 
controller who said he has ignored a doctors orders to take azt 
because he doesnt want to lose his job at one of the nations 
busiest air traffic control facilities 
that controller whose identity was concealed for the report 
said he knew of several others facing the same dilemma

first there was entertainment and news then 
there were commercials now there are infomercials 
and they lure unsuspecting consumers who cant tell the 
difference into spending millions of dollars on miracle 
products that dont stand up to their claims according to 
government officials and researchers 
consumers last year spent 450 million on questionable products 
and services hawked by infomercials programlength advertisements 
masquerading as objective programming rep ron wyden dore said 
friday 
for millions of americans watching television its getting 
harder and harder to distinguish between commercials and talk shows 
and news programs wyden said at a hearing on the programming by 
two house small business subcommittees 
witnesses testified that the shows should be clearly identified 
and more closely monitored for substantiation of claims 
infomercials are commercials frequently lasting a halfhour 
which are carried on broadcast and cable television most often 
during nonpeak and earlymorning time slots they use special 
report and talkshow program formats and often include live 
audiences familiar actors as hosts or former government officials 
as experts 
one of the essential questions in terms of consumer protection 
is whether viewers can identify infomercials as paid advertising 
said rader hayes an assistant professor of consumer science at the 
university of wisconsinmadison 
she showed the panels videotapes of infomercials touting items 
ranging from a stun gun as a cousin to the star trek phaser to 
a water cleaning system that claimed to aid in weight reduction 
hayes said an internationally recognizable symbol should be 
adopted and required to be visible on the tv screen during the 
entirety of infomercials because even i have been fooled 
it would be immediately evident to viewers that they are 
watching a paid commercial program she said 
harold a shoup vice president of the american association of 
advertising agencies said infomercials were a violation of our 
standards both in terms of the claims that are made as well as the 
format that masks the commercial purpose of the program itself 
shoup said no infomercials cited at fridays hearing were 
created by members of his group 
wyden chided government agencies reluctance to act against the 
ads 
the snake oil has been flowing in rivers and the federal 
government has been very slow to get to the levee he said 
the federal trade commission however has an active infomercial 
monitoring and investigation program said barry cutler director 
of the bureau of consumer protection at the agency 
in the past 18 months the ftc has taken six public law 
enforcement actions involving claims made in programlength ads 
cutler testified 
the commission is concentrating its efforts on major producers 
of infomercials and on obtaining consent decrees that cover all of 
their programming not just the individual cases involved in 
complaints cutler explained 
none of the hearing participants said new regulations or 
legislation were needed to control infomercial advertising

the central electoral 
board agreed friday to doublecheck vote totals in a tight 
presidential race after challenger juan bosch accused the board and 
incumbent president joaquin balaguer of fraud 
bosch at the same time withdrew his threat to lead street 
demonstrations protesting the vote count which went into its third 
day friday 
the electoral review though not a full recount is a laborious 
process affecting all races and could delay the outcome of 
wednesdays general election by two more days or longer officials 
said 
balaguer a fivetime president who is 83 and blind and bosch 
80 a former president who was overthrown in a 1963 military coup 
were locked in their fifth race for the presidency of this 
caribbean nation of 7 million people balaguer won three of the 
four previous races 
with 88 percent of polling stations reporting balaguer led 
bosch by 13000 votes according to the central electoral board 
balaguer had 579431 votes and bosch 566405 with 5873 of the 
6663 polling stations reporting official results showed jose 
francisco pena gomez a former socialist mayor of santo domingo and 
a former bosch protege was a distant third with 384647 
former president jimmy carter one of 30 international observers 
of the voting announced the decision to review the vote count at a 
news conference friday 
any fraud or honest errors will be discovered and resolved 
said carter reading in spanish from a statement signed jointly by 
him and froilan tavares the central electoral board president 
carter said all eight presidential candidates approved the 
procedure under which copies of tally sheets obtained by political 
parties from polling stations will be checked against tallies 
received by the electoral board 
the tally sheets record vote totals in all the elections 
including the 30 senate 120 congressional and 103 mayoral races 
official results showed balaguers social christian reformist 
party retaining control of the senate but the outcome of the other 
races remained unclear 
carter said bosch called off a street demonstration planned for 
friday and was cooperating with the electoral review 
neither professor bosch nor any of the candidates presented to 
me any evidence of fraud carter said in answer to questions he 
said there were some complaints about minor errors but i have no 
doubt these errors can be corrected 
the electoral board announced on television thursday night that 
election law barred public demonstrations while the vote count 
continued the announcement was repeated several times 
on friday morning a scuffle broke out when bosch arrived at his 
dominican liberation party headquarters where about 200 supporters 
had gathered reports conflicted as to what happened 
party vice president elfidio baez said an army intelligence 
agent stepped from the crowd and pulled a gun on bosch as he 
stepped from a car while two other men pushed bosch around 
supporters began hitting the agent before security men intervened 
and took him away baez said he said the two other men fled 
an army spokesman confirmed the man involved was an intelligence 
agent but denied the man drew a gun the spokesman who insisted 
on anonymity said the agent suffered minor injuries and was taken 
to a hospital by police 
bosch who served only seven months as president before being 
overthrown in 1963 accused both balaguer and the central electoral 
board of fraud in tabulating votes 
the central electoral board and dr balaguer committed a 
colossal fraud he told reporters thursday without elaboration 
about 32 million people were registered to vote nationwide 
bosch an author and intellectual who describes himself as a 
marxist but not a communist ran on a moderate platform endorsing 
capitalism as the best way to improve his countrys economic plight 
balaguer now blind from glaucoma was first elected president 
in 1966 and served three consecutive fouryear terms before losing 
in 1978 he was reelected in 1986 
balaguer has presided over a 2 billion publicworks project to 
transform santo domingo the project has created thousands of jobs 
but the countrys economic crisis has worsened

federal health officials want to use a new 
testing program to make experimental drugs available more quickly 
to people infected with the aids virus 
under the proposal announced friday a promising experimental 
drug that has been shown to be safe could be made available to 
patients who have no treatment alternative 
we are proposing this initiative because of its potential for 
prolonging lives said dr james mason assistant secretary for 
health in the department of health and human services 
patients with no treatment alternatives would be getting the 
drugs at the same time as patients who are participating in the 
second phase of clinical trials in this phase drugs found to be 
safe are tested for efficacy 
officials cautioned that the plan called parallel track 
would not replace or substitute for conventional drugtesting 
trials which are required for marketing approval by the food and 
drug administration 
we believe we have built sufficient safeguards into parallel 
track to ensure that it neither compromises the drug approval and 
clinical trials process nor delays the speedy delivery of promising 
investigational agents from the laboratory to the bedside mason 
said 
officials said they did not know which drug would be the first 
to be put on the parallel track 
the plan is not intended to decrease the time in which a drug 
gets marketing approval from the fda officials said 
this process usually takes years with the average being about 
42 years for lifeprolonging and lifesaving drugs fda officials 
have said 
the plan is similar to the expanded access system that was set 
up for the antiaids drug ddi or dideoxyinosine which is being 
compared in clinical trials with azt the only approved drug that 
fights the aids virus directly 
however under the ddi plan patients who were not in the 
clinical trials were getting the drug faster than the patients 
participating in the controlled trials because of the time it takes 
to set up such testing 
with parallel track that wouldnt happen said james allen 
director of the national aids program office clinical trials 
would need to be under way or at least starting at the time the 
drug would be made available for the wider distribution 
the parallel track idea was initiated last summer 
the public health service which includes the national 
institutes of health and the fda is proposing that it be used at 
first only for people with aids or those infected with the human 
immunodeficiency virus that causes aids 
but health officials said they will consider expanding the plan 
to make experimental drugs for other lifethreatening diseases 
available to patients earlier 
the proposal is to be published in the federal register on 
monday the public health service will accept public comments on 
the proposal for the next 60 days after which it can publish a 
final rule

death penalty opponents ended a 400mile 
twoweek march with a meeting with the daughter of martin luther 
king jr who called for an end to legalized murder 
i believe the death penalty is unchristian unamerican and 
unconstitutional bernice king said at ebenezer baptist church on 
friday she called on politicians to support stricter gun control 
measures and film makers to cease the endless glorification of 
violence in todays movies 
let us send a message from atlanta that we are today united 
and determined to put an end to legalized murder ms king said 
about 150 death penalty opponents were to participate today in 
laying a wreath on kings tomba core group of about 30 people made 
the entire journey to atlanta from starke fla they left may 4 
the death penalty is just the use of violence in a very 
selective way said sister helen prejean the louisiana nun who 
organized the pilgrimage it is an act of despair because 
anticrime problems are really much more complex than just 
executing a few people each year 
sister prejean had served as a spiritual adviser to dalton 
prejean who early friday in louisiana became the 128th prisoner 
put to death since executions resumed in the united states in 1977 
helen and dalton prejean were not related 
the death penalty opponents marched into the atlanta business 
district friday carrying 37 blackdraped coffinshaped boxes 
intended to represent states that have the death penalty on the 
books and 13 green plants for states where it is illegal 
the pilgrimage was sponsored by amnesty international the 
american friends service committee and the southern christian

sixyear process of reconciliation with the soviet union without 
damaging egypts special relationship with the united states 
mubarak returned home with political and economic benefits for 
egypt after a 46hour visit to moscow this week the first by an 
egyptian head of state in 18 years 
he won soviet president mikhail gorbachevs public support for 
his middle east policies it included gorbachevs strong 
condemnation of israel for allowing soviet jewish immigrants to 
settle on occupied arab territories 
the two nations also signed an agreement that holds the promise 
of substantial soviet economic aid for egypt during the 1990s 
perhaps more importantly the improvement in cairomoscow 
relations has not come at washingtons expense 
there was no hint during mubaraks visit of any soviet intent to 
revive the kremlins old role as egypts principal arms supplier a 
function that the united states assumed in 1980 nor was there any 
suggestion of moscow trying to join the united states in current 
middle east peacemaking efforts 
rather mubarak came away with a soviet pledge to support us 
and egyptian efforts to initiate a palestinianisraeli dialogue in 
cairo previously moscows policy focused solely on the 
israelispurned idea of an international middle east peace 
conference 
mubaraks visit came six years after he initiated a policy of 
trying to normalize relations with the soviet union where as a 
young air force officer he trained to be a fighter pilot 
he began by restoring diplomatic representation to the level of 
ambassador later he mended other fences smashed by his 
predecessor anwar sadat 
sadat assassinated by moslem extremists almost nine years ago 
was the last egyptian head of state to visit moscow in 1972 just 
before relations soured first the soviets refused to meet egypts 
arms requests sadat reacted with sweeping reprisals including 
expelling 17000 soviet military personnel 
despite the improvement in relations since 1984 there remained 
what one egyptian official termed a psychological shortcoming in 
terms of the absence of personal facetoface contact at the top 
mubaraks visit to moscow from monday to wednesday sealed that 
breach 
ibrahim nafei editor of cairos leading newspaper alahram and 
a member of mubaraks entourage wrote that the meeting rectified 
the balance of relations and put them in the proper context 
more accurately it codified the relationship on the 
footing of close personal knowledge between the two leaders that 
had been missing 
the visit was part of an asianeuropean tour that also took 
mubarak to china north korea oman and britain 
before setting out mubarak made clear his objectives included 
seeking economic benefits and marshaling opposition to the settling 
of soviet jewish immigrants in the israelioccupied west bank and 
gaza strip 
he evidently succeeded 
in a moscow dinner speech honoring mubarak gorbachev denounced 
settling jewish immigrants among the 17 million palestinians 
living in the west bank and gaza as antisoviet it is part of 
insidious designs by israel he said 
to push emigrants to israel into doing that amounts to 
dangerously and immorally playing with their fates gorbachev 
said 
it was moscows strongest censure of israel since the influx of 
soviet jews began last fall israel captured the west bank from 
jordan and gaza from egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
officials in cairo said the soviets promised to consider 
egyptian ideas on the emigration issue one would grant soviet jews 
the right to return if they find difficulties in israel after 
emigrating another would ask the united states to relax 
restrictions on soviet jewish immigration 
hundreds of thousands of soviet jews are expected to emigrate to 
israel in the next few years as the result of a relaxation of 
travel regulations in the soviet union and a tighter entry quota in 
the united states 
israel says it has no policy of settling the new arrivals in the 
occupied territories 
gorbachev and mubarak also signed a joint declaration that 
reflected an apparent shift by moscow on middle east peacemaking 
the joint declaration clearly gave precedence to usbrokered 
peace talks over an international conference aimed at reaching an 
overall middle east settlement 
the two countries signed a 10year agreement that sets 
guidelines for economic commercial scientific and technological 
cooperation 
under the accord egyptian officials anticipate receiving soviet 
economic aid amounting to 700 million to 800 million they said 
this would include expansion of egypts steel and aluminum 
industries originally built with soviet help and construction of 
new power stations

managua nicaragua a decision by the contra guerrillas to stop 
disarming has drawn energetic criticism from spokesmen for both the 
sandinista opposition and president violeta barrios de chamorros 
government 
the announcement friday came despite an earlier agreement to 
disarm one of the key elements of the transition from president 
daniel ortegas sandinista government to mrs chamorro who was 
inaugurated april 25 
alfredo cesar one of mrs chamorros closest advisers said the 
contras should understand that the nations stability depends on 
the disarmament the demobilization and the full integration of the 
rebels into civil life 
the contras had agreed to disarm by june 10 but the process was 
going slowly with only 1000 of about 11000 fighters putting down 
their weapons as of thursday 
in a communique signed by chief of staff israel galeano the 
contras announced they were suspending the disarmament process 
indefinitely because of an atmosphere of uncertainty and social 
instability 
galeano was referring to strikes by government workers that 
paralyzed mrs chamorros government earlier this week 
he also asserted the contras were not receiving promised medical 
assistance and food some sandinista troops were still in security 
zones where the rebels have concentrated and demobilized contras 
were being harassed when they returned home 
galeano also called for a meeting to review the accords a call 
that drew an angry reaction from the sandinistas 
we think that these accords should be carried out exactly as 
they were signed said sergio ramirez leader of the sandinista 
delegation to the national assembly 
the contra announcement came as the national assembly was 
debating a series of laws designed to reverse laws passed by the 
lameduck sandinista assembly between the feb 25 election and the 
inauguration 
mrs chamorro had attempted to suspend some of the laws by 
presidential decree but gave up when government workers staged 
sitdown strikes 
laws to reform the civil service and national labor laws were 
passed by 482 and 470 respectively the 39 sandinista 
representatives abstained saying the laws were unconstitutional 
a controversial law on university autonomy was withdrawn at the 
last moment at mrs chamorros request drawing applause from both 
sides in the assembly 
mrs chamorro said she was setting up a special commission 
including sandinista university leaders to study changes in the 
law which grants the universities selfgovernment 
mrs chamorros coalition charges that the sandinistas are 
trying to entrench themselves in the universities while the 
sandinistas say the government is trying to destroy university 
independence 
several hundred students many of whom feared government budget 
cuts would increase the cost of education demonstrated against the 
measure outside the assembly throughout the day 
the basic disarmament agreement was signed by representatives of 
the contras and mrs chamorros transition team march 23 
subsequent agreements signed during april and may set the 
disarmament to begin may 8 and end june 10 
ramirez who was vice president during the sandinista 
administration stressed friday that there could be no changes in 
the accords because to do so would be to renew uncertainty and 
open the perspective of more pain more death more blood 
cesar a former civilian contra leader who now is also first 
secretary of the assembly said the government and un observers 
would have to hold an urgent meeting on the contra decision 
representatives of the un group that is overseeing the 
disarmament process have said privately that they do not expect 
that the process can be completed by june 10 
luis sanchez the assemblys first vice president said he 
wasnt surprised by the sandinistaled strikes or the contra 
decision 
this is a result of the terrible damage done by 10 years of 
war to the national conscience said sanchez nobody trusts 
anybody

two cosmonauts aboard the soviet space station 
mir are awaiting delivery of a ladder so they can repair the space 
ship that would speed them back to earth in case of an emergency 
the ladder is to be carried aloft aboard an unmanned resupply 
craft that is scheduled for launch on june 1 the magazine aviation 
week and space technology says in its may 21 issue 
the soviets had disclosed previously that the soyuz tm9 
spacecraft was damaged apparently when it was launched feb 11 en 
route to the mir with cosmonauts anatoli solovyev and aleksandr 
balandin three of the ships eight thermal blankets came loose 
this is a situation which generally requires attention of 
course but it probably is not all that serious one of the 
cosmonauts said in a threeminute excerpt carried on soviet radio 
on march 9 he said he and his companion were prepared for a space 
walk 
the soviets use small soyuz capsules to transport cosmonauts to 
and from the space station sometimes the crews will ride their own 
soyuz back to earth at other times a crew that has been aboard the 
mir will travel in a soyuz brought by other cosmonauts the space 
station has several docking ports 
aviation week interviewed cosmonaut alexander a serebrov who 
recently returned from the mir where he photographe the damaged 
soyuz tm9 vehicle from his own tm8 spacecraft 
the pictures show large thermal blankets on the outside of the 
tm9 have been ripped out of place the magazine said they are 
blocking key sensors needed to align the spacecraft properly for 
reentry to earths atmosphere 
in addition the vehicles metal skin has been exposed to space 
degrading its ability to control temperature inside 
the soyuz has become cold causing a buildup of water 
condensation in the vehicle aviation week said it quoted 
serebrov as saying engineers are concerned that the condensation 
could cause an electrical malfunction during reentry 
some repair materials were aboard an unmanned resupply vehicle 
progress 42 which docked with mir on may 8 the ladder is expected 
to arrive aboard an unmanned kristall module

the hubble space telescope is finally ready to 
send its first picture from space 
unless something unexpected interferes the picture will be 
taken sunday morning and sent to the goddard space flight center in 
maryland in the afternoon the national aeronautics and space 
administration was to announce the exact time today 
the image wont be much better than a similar view taken with 
far lessexpensive telescopes from earth 
we will probably learn nothing of any scientific value because 
the telescope wont be performing anywhere near its eventual 
value nasas hubble project scientist ed weiler said friday 
this not a science image just an engineering picture 
the first picture will be of an open star cluster called theta 
carina in the southern constellation carina a latin word that 
means ships keel the cluster is 3 billion years old 1260 light 
years from earth and 21 light years across its astronomical 
designation is ngc3532 
the wide field planetary camera one of five scientific 
instruments on the telescope will store the picture sunday morning 
on an onboard recorder later the image will be transmitted to the 
ground through a relay satellite and run through a computer to 
remove background noise 
were all kind of excited all looking forward to getting 
first light out of our way weiler said

fourteenyearold brian jenkins of malvern 
ark found it hard to believe he was in last place of the closing 
round of the national mathcounts finals but he wasnt daunted by 
the odds 
jenkins won the only national mathematics competition for junior 
high school students friday by first beating robert shih of palos 
verdes estates calif who had tied him for ninth place 
the eighth grader outfigured the other eight opponents in 
rapidfire fashion including the three who had made perfect scores 
in the written round of the contest 
to top first placecontestant matthew crawford 12 of 
birmingham ala jenkins gave the correct response of 10 when 
asked how many combinations of wins and losses are possible if a 
team is to win a series of basketball games and if the series is 
won when one team wins three out of five games 
with that answer jenkins won an 8000 scholarship a gold 
medal a personal computer and a week at us space camp in 
huntsville ala 
i thought i had a pretty good chance of winning jenkins 
said explaining his attitude as he entered the ballroom of the 
washington hotel 
but when you said i tied for ninth place i found that hard to 
believe he told a program official but as i got going i 
thought i had a pretty good chance 
jenkins correctly answered 22 of the tough math questions and 
acknowledged he had to actually calculate seven or eight of the 
problems 
runnerup crawford took home a silver medal and a 6000 
scholarship while thirdplace finisher daniel schepler 14 of 
beavercreek ohio was awarded a bronze medal and 4000

the veterans administration has decided to 
allow disability payments to vietnam veterans with softtissue 
sarcoma a rare form of cancer linked to agent orange exposure 
veterans secretary edward j derwinski announced the action 
friday the second time this year the va has decided to award 
compensation for cancers linked to exposure to the 
dioxincontaminated herbicide that was sprayed in undiluted form 
during the vietnam war 
on march 29 derwinski announced that veterans suffering from 
nonhodgkins lymphoma would be eligible for compensation 
fridays decision was based on the recommendations made by the 
vas veterans advisory committee on environmental hazards a panel 
of outside scientists and lay people it found thursday that there 
is at least as likely as not a significant statistical 
association between the disease and exposure to agent orange 
the ruling in march was based on a study by the centers for 
disease control study of selected cancers researchers found a 50 
percent increased risk of nonhodgkins lymphoma among vietnam 
veterans but the study looked only indirectly at whether agent 
orange was the cause 
the cdc study found no such increased risk for softtissue 
sarcoma but the advisory committees examination of other 
scientific literature relating to herbicide and dioxin exposure 
tilted the balance in favor of compensation 
i believe this is another step forward in resolving a most 
difficult and emotional issue derwinski said we intend to 
proceed as quickly as possible to award compensation to these 
veterans who are so deserving of our care and concern 
for years veterans have been seeking compensation for diseases 
they say were caused by agent orange a combination of two phenoxy 
herbicides one of which was contaminated with the byproduct dioxin 
as many as 28 health problems mostly cancers can be associated 
with exposure according to adm elmo r zumwalt jr a special 
adviser to derwinski 
va plans to publish its final compensation regulation for 
softtissue sarcomas in early fall an estimated 1100 veterans or 
their survivors are expected to receive compensation for 
softtissue sarcomas to start with an additional 50 claims 
annually are expected thereafter given the long latency period for 
cancer 
softtissue sarcomas are a group of malignant tumors found on 
muscles and connective tissue or in body fat

president bush should be allowed to decide 
whether to punish nations that use chemical or biological weapons 
in violation of international law the state department argues 
deputy spokesman richard boucher called on congressional 
negotiators friday to reject a bill approved 920 by the senate 
on thursday requiring the president to impose sanctions in all 
such cases 
if the bill is passed in its senate form administration 
officials say they will recommend that bush veto it they say it 
would restrict the presidents constitutional responsibility to 
conduct foreign policy 
the administration believes that flexible and nonmandatory 
sanctions legislation can play a useful role in support of our 
policy objectives boucher said 
he said the bush administration supports a bill passed earlier 
by the house which he said enables the president to target 
sanctions for maximum effectiveness taking into account the entire 
range of our foreign and national security policy interests 
boucher said bush has taken the lead in seeking a global 
chemical weapons ban and noted that talks are underway with the 
soviet union on a range of weapons issues including a possible 
agreement to reduce chemical weapons stocks in anticipation of a 
global ban 
but lawmakers said they are concerned about the spread of the 
weapons among third world countries 
its clear that the inhibition against the use of chemical 
weapons is slipping said sen claiborne pell dri chairman 
of the senate foreign relations committee 
the legislation was prompted by the use of chemical weapons in 
the iraniraq war iraqs reported use of the weapons last year 
against its kurdish minority and iraqs recent threat to use 
chemical weapons against israel 
the bill declares that as many as 20 nations are capable of 
producing chemical weapons and that by the year 2000 at least 15 
developing countries will have the ability to produce ballistic 
missiles capable of delivering such weapons to their targets 
the senate sanctions require a cutoff of arms sales an embargo 
on imports from violating countries an end to credit guarantees 
from the us exportimport bank a halt to financial assistance 
from us banks and an end to us military and economic assistance 
they would apply to governments and also to foreign companies 
that help them produce chemical and biological weapons

a fortified tunnel under the usmexico 
border and the noses of us customs agents allowed drug 
dealers to smuggle at least a ton of cocaine into the united states 
while smuggling profits out 
us authorities and mexican judicial police thursday night 
jointly raided the tunnel connecting a warehouse on the american 
side of the border and a singlefamily home 200 feet south in agua 
prieta mexico 
thomas mcdermott in charge of the us customs service in 
arizona described the concretelined tunnel dubbed cocaine 
alley as the most unique smuggling operation i have ever come 
across 
a tremendous amount of engineering went into it he said 
it was like something out of a james bond movie customs 
spokeswoman judy turner said friday 
a hydraulically lifted concrete slab covered the entrance on the 
mexican side with a pool table covering the slab 
both the warehouse and home were owned by rafael francisco 
camarena 33 of mexico mcdermott declined to say whether there 
was a warrant for camarenas arrest but said two other men were 
arrested near phoenix on may 11 
about 25 or 30 pounds of marijuana was found in the mexican part 
of the tunnel he said 
the tunnel was estimated to have cost at least 1 million and 
was within one block of an unmarked customs enforcement building 
and four blocks from the international port of entry 
mcdermott said he had no estimate of how much cocaine had been 
smuggled through the tunnel 
the proximity to american authorities indicated the 
sophistication of drug smugglers and the measures such groups will 
take to move dope into the united states mcdermott said 
there had been speculation for years that tunnels were being 
used but they werent talking about this type of tunnel he 
said the tunnel really shows what the profit motive is its not 
just cocaine coming in its the profits probably going back 
its a helluva way to get cash out of a country 
turner said it was something that you and i in the ordinary 
world would only find in the movies 
the raid followed months of investigation and the seizure may 11 
of 2258 pounds of cocaine near phoenix that was traced to the 
warehouse 
caesar t howard 44 of mesa and joseph e osborn 31 of 
tempe were arrested with the cocaine valued at 102 million 
authorities said 
the warehouse a metal prefabricated building about 40 by 120 
feet is about 8 months old the house which mcdermott described 
as very nice was built about the same time he said 
the mexican entrance was hidden by a concrete slab about 8 by 12 
feet covered by a pool table a spigot in the homes yard was 
actually an adjustment valve that hoisted the pool table and 
concrete slab 
a 5footlong steel grate in the warehouse floor resembling a 
drain disguised the american exit underneath was a 7foothigh 
concreteblock room about 10 by 8 feet that was used for storage 
mcdermott said 
a cementlined shaft with a pulley system led from the room to 
the 5feet diameter tunnel equipped with a cart for the smugglers 
to ferry cocaine he said 
the tunnel dips to 40 feet on the mexican side an fbi agent 
said and mcdermott said it passes below a drainage ditch between 
the countries that is at least 10 feet below ground 
mcdermott said the investigation was continuing and that when a 
new smuggling method is discovered we are certainly gonna spread 
the word and look in other places that this may be employed

an aidsinfected inmate convicted of biting 
a sheriffs officer was sentenced to 25 years in prison despite 
appeals from civil rights groups who said the sentence grew out of 
hysteria over the disease 
superior court judge john b mariano on friday said gregory d 
smith 26 would serve at least 12 years before becoming eligible 
for parole 
smith was convicted april 11 of attempted murder four counts of 
aggravated assault and one count of making terroristic threats for 
biting sheriffs officer albert waddington 26 
mariano said it wasnt important that experts think it doubtful 
aids can be spread through biting or spitting what counts is what 
smith believed when he bit waddington mariano said waddington has 
not tested positive for aids 
the weapon of choice was not his fist but rather his teeth 
and saliva mariano said his only purpose was to give the 
guard a slow and agonizing death which evidences the depravity of 
his actions 
tears rolled down smiths face as he stood handcuffed after the 
sentencing 
you are more or less sentencing me to life because youll be 
taking my life away from me he said i never bit that officer 
and ill say that until the day i die 
during the trial waddington said smith bit him three times on 
the hand spat on him and said now die you pig die from what i 
have the episode occurred when smith was being taken to a 
hospital for a checkup from the prison where he is serving a 
fiveyear robbery sentence 
mariano said he had received scores of letters asking for 
leniency from prisoner and aids advocacy groups 
after mariano imposed the sentence about 20 protesters stood 
and began chanting shame shame shame on you judge 
the message was exactly the one we wanted to prevent one of 
continuing the fear and hysteria about aids said judy greenspan 
a monitor of aidsrelated cases for the american civil liberties 
unions national prison project 
he was not sentenced because he bit anybody he was not 
sentenced because he commited a crime ms greenspan said he 
was sentenced because hes hiv positive 
smith is one of about 10 people in the country charged with 
attempting to spread the virus through biting or spitting in 
texas curtis weeks 28 was sentenced to life in prison in 
november for spitting on a prison guard and announcing he wanted to 
take someone out with him

the us government has agreed to give 
850000 to laos to buy artificial limbs and rehabilitation devices 
in 19901991 the official laotian news agency kpl reported 
the report said it was the second project funded by the us 
agency for international development since the thaw of the two 
countries diplomatic relations the first project for rural 
development in the northeastern province of houa phanh began late 
last year 
the kpl report friday was seen in bangkok today 
it said a memorandum on the new agreement was signed thursday in 
the capital vientiane by laotian foreign minister soubanh 
sritthirath and by richard solomon the us assistant secretary of 
state for asian affairs solomon visited laos as part of a regional 
tour 
us relations with laos have improved since the communist 
government there agreed in 1987 to accelerate cooperation in the 
search for the remains of american servicemen reported missing in 
action from the vietnam war 
a us military team is in laos to excavate two warplane crash 
sites that previous investigations have indicated may yield remains 
of missing airmen they are the fourth and fifth joint excavations 
with laotians experts this year 
american officials said last year that relations soon may be 
upgraded to the ambassadorial level each country is now 
represented by charges daffaires 
the aid for houa phanh marked the first time since the 
communists came to power in 1975 that the united states has 
directly funded a development project in laos it is part of an 
effort to eradicate the cultivation of illicit narcotics 
the kpl report did not say who would receive the artificial 
limbs and rehabilitation aid many laotians were maimed after the 
vietnam war spilled over into laos since the war ended in 1975 
many others have lost limbs after they accidently triggered 
unexploded bombs dropped by the americans

announcement by mills college that it was reversing a decision two 
weeks to admit undergraduate men to the elite liberal arts school 
trustees agreed friday to keep men out of classes at the 
138yearold college after alumnae put together an alternative 
financial rescue plan they had been forced to do so by students 
who held a twoweek strike that closed down the school 
women who are taught to strive for equality and justice have a 
power that can never be crushed said melissa stevensondile 
incoming student body president on this day may 18 1990 the 
women of mills college have proved we are worthy of our education

boost enrollment from its current 777 to 1000 and help balance 
mills 24 million annual budget yearly tuition at the school is 
almost 12000 
all of you have had a lot of banners for us all week heres 
one for you board chairman warren hellman told a crowd of about 
300 women as he unfurled a banner that read mills for women 
again 
sometimes in your lifetime you are involved in something that 
may not just change an institution it may change the world i 
think youve done it he said 
graduation ceremonies will be held as planned sunday but 
students wont get their diplomas until this summer because records 
couldnt be verified in time to issue the documents 
college president mary metz stopped short of giving the student 
protesters full credit for the reversal and warned that if the 
school runs into serious financial trouble administrators will 
again consider admitting men 
the civil disobedience was very important in expressing care 
for the college and giving us time to work out the future she 
said 
senior jamai deuberry 22 said students are confident that they 
and alumnae will be able to help boost enrollment and gifts to the 
school as proposed under the mills rescue plan 
we do not shy away from that responsibility deuberry said 
the alumnae raised 3 million in a sevenday telephone fund 
drive after a group of former mills students met with hellman 
teachers voted by a 2to1 margin to ask mills trustees to 
reverse the move and allow five years to see if changes in 
recruitment and curriculum could increase enrollment 
the students on thursday ended their strike that included 
boycotting classes 
the switch to coeducation had been considered for a year 
enrollment in mills 33 undergraduate programs dipped 42 percent 
from three years ago

an ebullient helmut kohl waxed poetic 
after the two german nations signed a historic treaty to merge 
their economies saying that holding back unification was as futile 
as trying to stop the rhine river the west german chancellor 
beamed throughout the treatysigning ceremony inside the opulent 
governmentowned palais schaumburg after the east and west german 
finance ministers signed the treaty kohl broke into a smile and 
started a chorus of applause 
the treaty all but ensures the west german chancellors place in 
history as the man who choreographed the end of germanys 
fourdecade division 
the treaty was signed friday just 10 days after the 45th 
anniversary of nazi germanys may 8 1945 defeat the seed of 
germanys separation 
what we are living through here is the birth of a free and 
united germany kohl said 
this is a historic hour in the life of the german nation 
said the west german leader addressing members of both his cabinet 
and that of east german prime minister lothar de maiziere 
but kohl admitted there is still much work ahead of us in 
negotiations between the two german nations and the four world war 
ii victors the united states soviet union britain and france 
on the international aspects of unity 
formal unification cannot occur until the thorny question of a 
united germanys military allegiance is settled the soviet union 
rejects nato membership for a unified germany while the united 
states insists the german nation should belong to the nato alliance 
kohl has hinted that he hopes full political unification will be 
achieved in allgerman elections at the end of the year 
despite kohls jubilation german enthusiasm over the economic 
merger treaty was not unanimous 
the treaty will plunge fragile east germany into the rigors of 
capitalism starting july 2 many east germans fear unemployment and 
price increases could be the immediate result as state subsidies 
are eliminated west germans worry that the awesome unification 
costs will lead to inflation and tax hikes 
west germanys leftist greens party boycotted the treatysigning 
ceremony charging that the agreement will leave east germans more 
impoverished than they already are 
we dont want to be dazed spectators of this consummation of 
subjugation the greens said in a statement 
new forum the east german activist organization that started 
the autumn revolution that toppled the hardline communist 
leadership had a similar assessment 
sacrificing all sovereignty the gdr east german government 
bows to the will of the victors in bonn whose power will triumph 
in a future germany over the dignity and interests of the gdr 
populace neues forum said 
hansjochen vogel head of west germanys main opposition social 
democratic party said the treaty on economic merger leaves open 
a whole series of questions 
vogel said it is still unclear for example how east 
germanmade products can be protected from competition with 
bettermade goods from west germany 
but the east german government has opted for annexation by west 
germanys own powerful economy as preferable to possible economic 
collapse 
flanked by kohl and de maiziere the finance ministers of the 
two nations signed the treaty under which east germanys economy 
and social services will be absorbed by west germanys 
under the treaty west germanys deutsche mark will become east 
germanys legal tender all monetary affairs will be controlled by 
west germanys central bank 
de maiziere said not all flowery dreams of east germans will 
be fulfilled with the treaty but no one will be worse off than 
before 
kohl struck a surprisingly poetic note to express his belief 
that unification has always been a matter of destiny 
there flows the rhine said kohl nodding toward the 
legendary river streaming past the palais schaumburg 
it streams along on its way seeking the sea naturally you 
can stem its flow or make it detour and that would create much 
trouble on the river banks 
but the water reaches the sea and thats also how it is with 
the current of german history

thengov george ariyoshi of hawaii received 
50000 in cash from imelda marcos in 1982 the los angeles times 
reported today quoting expense logs entered as evidence at her 
racketeering trial in new york 
the money reportedly was paid to ariyoshi three days after the 
democrat announced his intention to run for reelection the times 
said 
if it was a campaign contribution state law required it to be 
reported to the hawaii campaign spending commission in any case 
such a large contribution would have been illegal 
state records show that ariyoshi governor from 1974 to 1986 
did not report the 50000 payment from mrs marcos as a campaign 
contribution the times said 
ariyoshi now a private attorney was reportedly on a business 
trip to japan his secretary said she had forwarded his interview 
requests to him but he had not responded by the time the story 
went to print 
in the past ariyoshi has acknowleged getting gifts from the 
marcoses but declined to describe the extent or nature of those 
offerings calling giftgiving a private act of courtesy the 
times said 
ariyoshis name appears in the log of a july 1982 trip that mrs 
marcos made to the soviet union morocco and the united states the 
times said 
on a page listing cash disbursements for july 20 1982 is 
the brief handwritten entry 50000 given to gov ariyoshi 
it said 
the logs are written in notebooks in which a private secretary 
to mrs marcos identified in testimony as longtime aide fe roa 
gimenez maintained a running account of expenses incurred by mrs 
marcos 
ben cassiday one of mrs marcos attorneys told honolulu 
television station khon that travel records show mrs marcos was 
not in hawaii in july 1982 
cassiday said mrs marcos and her late husband former 
philippine president ferdinand marcos gave small gifts to ariyoshi 
over the years but mrs marcos denies giving money to ariyoshi 
she told me that she thought it very unfair that governor 
ariyoshi was being brought into this whole entire situation 
cassiday said and she promised me that she had never given a 
dime to governor ariyoshi 
cassiday questioned the reliability of the logs 
these books and these little records are so inaccurate he 
said seventy percent of whats down here has already been proven 
false 
mrs marcos trial on charges of racketeering mail fraud and 
obstruction of justice resumes wednesday at us district court in 
new york she is accused of helping her husband embezzle 220 
million from the philippines treasury to buy new york property and 
art works 
ariyoshi is a longtime friend of mrs marcos he was at hickam 
air force base in honolulu to greet the marcoses in february 1986 
when they fled the philippines in the wake of an uprising that 
brought corazon aquino to power 
marcos died in exile in honolulu in september following a long 
illness

the drive for a ussoviet summit declaration to 
cut nuclear arms went into overtime today as secretary of state 
james a baker iii delayed his departure for washington for more 
talks 
baker set up an extra meeting with foreign minister eduard a 
shevarndadze today amid indication of progress on limiting cruise 
missiles one of the toughest unresolved issues 
a mixed working group of us and soviet experts took up the 
pursuit of an agreement with baker and shevardnadze awaiting the 
results of their deliberations before entering the negotiations 
again themselves 
we havent closed a senior us official said after baker 
held 10 hours of talks on friday five of them with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev both sides claimed progress 
president bush and gorbachev would like to announce at their may 
31june 3 summit in washington agreement on all the key issues in a 
treaty to reduce the superpowers longrange nuclear missiles 
bombers and submarines 
us and soviet negotiators in geneva would then work at least 
through the summer to complete the details 
the gaps are not seen as being unbridgeable the senior us 
official said at a news briefing held under rules granting him 
anonymity 
he also cautioned reporters i cant tell you we are going to 
get there 
baker had planned to fly home today after a news conference 
announcing the results of his fiveday visit to moscow instead he 
scheduled another meeting with shevardnadze and delayed his 
departure until at least midafternoon 
if you can close obviously you are going to do it the 
senior us official said if you cant its not the end of the 
world 
other american officials gave a more upbeat assessment they 
said baker and shevardnadze had settled most of their differences 
over limiting the ranges of cruise missiles carried aboard planes 
and ships 
a settlement on the elusive nucleartipped weapons would clear 
the biggest obstacle to a treaty cutting the overall arsenals of 
us and soviet longrange nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 35 
percent 
but the officials cautioned that many details still must be 
worked out 
baker and shevardnadze had reported earlier friday that they had 
made progress on the treaty 
i have always believed the main points will be agreed upon 
shevardnadze said things are moving in that direction 
baker after seeing gorbachev told reporters we made some 
progress we still have a number of issues that are still out 
there 
shevardnadze standing at his side chimed in we did a lot 
we accomplished a lot today 
the foreign minister also gave a positive report on negotiations 
to ban the production of chemical weapons asked whether a 
ussoviet agreement was ready for the summit he replied yes 
major progress was made 
bush last week offered to halt the production of us binary 
weapons two chemical potions that become deadly when mixed if 
the soviets were willing to schedule the destruction of their 
poison gas stockpiles shevardnadze gave no details of the emerging 
accord which is also designed for a summit signing 
earlier in the kremlin gorbachev said his side was doing its 
best to stitch together a strategic arms reduction treaty he had 
been accused of backsliding by the bush administration before 
bakers arrival here tuesday 
the soviet leader said he did not know whether the goal of a 
framework agreement would be met but i think we are moving 
closer

two police stations with firebombs today and riot police 
surrounded a university where about 15000 militants had thrown up 
barricades

night by thousands of antigovernment protesters after a rally 
marking the 10th anniversary of a prodemocracy uprising in the 
southern city that was crushed by the military 
about 2000 riot police armed with shields and clubs sealed off 
the campus of chonnam university on the northern edge of kwangju 
about 230 students were arrested by police near the campus the 
national news agency yonhap said 
at a rally inside the campus thousands of radical students 
jabbed their fists in the air and screamed down with president 
roh taewoo and yankee go home 
our nation has no hope until roh taewoo is ousted student 
leader song gapsuk told the rally song is one of 17 student 
militants sought by police on charges of instigating violent 
antigovernment protests 
students used tires school desks chairs and broken furniture 
to erect 10foothigh barricades at the universitys three gates 
more than 500 students armed with threefoot metal pipes stood 
guard inside the gates 
groups of several hundred radical students marched around the 
sprawling campus throughout the day singing protest songs 
police set up roadblocks around kwangju to prevent more people 
from joining the protesters 
at dawn today police fired warning shots into the air from 
pistols and rifles as dozens of militant students attacked two 
kwangju police stations with firebombs yonhap reported 
the students fled and no arrests or damage were reported the 
news agency said 
police said about 5300 people were arrested friday in 
nationwide protests in more than a dozen cities marking the 10th 
anniversary of a prodemocracy uprising in kwangju a city of more 
than 1 million people about 150 miles south of seoul 
police said all but 481 of the 4325 arrested in seoul had been 
released in kwangju police said 123 people were arrested and at 
least 20 injured another 23 were injured in other cities

citizens rose up against the central government to protest a 
crackdown on political dissent protesters took control of the city

roh a former army general is unpopular in kwangju because of 
his alleged role in crushing the 1980 revolt he was a key member 
of the thenmartiallaw government that suppressed the uprising 
the worst in modern korean history 
antius sentiment is also strong among kwangju citizens 
because many believe washington condoned the ruthless crushing of 
the revolt the united states has repeatedly denied the charges 
after the initial nighttime rally thousands of students marched 
along downtown streets shouting antigovernment and antius 
slogans 
when blocked by squads of riot police near a district

the chrysler corp said its new 
400horsepower dodge viper sports car has a top speed of 190 miles 
per hour and will cost under 50000 when it goes on the market 
in 1992 
the company on friday unveiled the car powered by a v10 engine 
originally designed for trucks chrysler chairman lee iacocca said 
it could accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 39 seconds 
chrysler officials said they eventually expect to produce about 
5000 vipers a year to be sold at 300 to 500 us dealerships 
the vipers development cost chrysler tens and tens of 
millions not hundreds of millions iacocca said adding it 
could make money for the company at a sales pace of 5000 cars a 
year 
features on the sleek twoseater which debuted at the detroit 
auto show in january 1989 include an integrated roll bar and 
exhaust pipes built into a cutaway side it is designed to compete 
with chevrolets highperformance corvette 
among the team members who came up with the viper concept was 
chrysler consultant carroll shelby father of the popular shelby 
cobras 
iacocca told reporters at a downtown news conference that it was 
shelby who edged him out of getting the first cobra produced in the 
1960s 
shelby has been offered millions and millions of dollars for 
that car iacocca noted ruefully 
i am not making the same mistake twice he said pointing to 
a red viper on display this one here is mine

the government has announced a plan to 
fight terrorism but says it will not create a new unit to replace 
the hated secret police of the previous military regime 
interior minister enrique krauss said the government is instead 
reinforcing the nations regular police services because they are 
the only institutions legally in charge of guaranteeing public 
order and security 
krauss told a new conference that the government is already 
allocating additional funds to police to hire more personnel and 
purchase new equipment he did not elaborate 
under the previous rule of gen augusto pinochet the security 
work was carried out by a secret police agency known as national 
information central which was widely accused of torture killing 
and the illegal arrest of dissidents 
pinochets agency made up mostly of military officers 
maintained secret detention centers and its agents worked under 
assumed names it was disbanded shortly before pinochet handed over 
power march 11 to his elected civilian successor patricio aylwin 
the secret police files were either destroyed or transferred to 
the army which has not made them available to the new government 
pinochet remains army commander 
since its inauguration the aylwin government has faced sporadic 
political violence and terrorism in march two retired army 
generals were shot and seriously wounded by a procommunist leftist 
guerrilla group last week a retired police colonel who was 
prominent in pinochets secret service was killed 
a series of recent bombings in santiago has damaged government 
military and business targets 
krauss said those actions seek to damage the democratic 
process and vowed that the government will do whatever 
necessary to safeguard the newly restored democracy 
aylwin is the first civilian president since salvador allende 
who was overthrown by pinochets forces in 1973

a professor was charged with disorderly 
conduct for draping a bikini over the bare breasts of the citys 
most recognized statue to protest the prosecution of an art gallery 
for obscenity 
the contemporary arts center and its director dennis barrie 
were indicted in april over an exhibit containing sexually explicit 
photographs by the late robert mapplethorpe 
michael d shapiro a math professor at ohio state university in 
columbus said he came out of a visit to the arts center last 
sunday outraged at the prosecution he noticed that nude statues 
were on display in the center of nearby fountain square which is 
the heart of the city 
when i walked out of the mapplethorpe exhibit and saw a naked 
statue of a child less than a block away the irony struck me 
shapiro 41 said today in the columbus dispatch it just showed 
me that the attacks on the mapplethorpe exhibit are politically 
motivated and not about nudity 
shapiro also wrapped a flourescent orange diaper with black 
hearts over the buttocks of a statue of a nude boy 
the officer who arrested me said you can do a lot of things 
in this town but dont mess with the statue he said 
shapiro pleaded no contest tuesday in hamilton county municipal 
court he was not fined or sentenced but was ordered to pay 32 in 
court costs 
the arts center and barrie were indicted by a hamilton county 
grand jury on charges of pandering obscenity and using pictures of 
children in material involving nudity when the exhibit opened april 
7 seven photographs in the 175piece exhibit display naked 
children or homoeroticism

lithuanias parliament began an emergency session 
today on compromise proposals that leaders of the secessionist 
baltic republic hope will lead to negotiations with the kremlin 
lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene opened the 
session of the supreme council by telling the lawmakers of her 
talks in moscow with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
according to a spokeswoman for the parliament 
lawmakers were to consider compromise measures that would keep 
lithuania in the soviet defense system address border issues and 
outline a transition period to full independence 
the measures are contingent however on the kremlin beginning 
negotiations with lithuania it does not call for suspending or 
rescinding the republics march 11 declaration of independence 
since march 11 and throughout a subsequent economic embargo on 
oil natural gas and other key materials imposed on the republic by 
gorbachev lithuanian officials have refused to roll back on the 
declaration they have said other issues may be negotiated 
in an hourlong meeting with mrs prunskiene on friday secretary 
of state james a baker iii had urged her to consider suspending 
the declaration according to a us official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
before she returned to the lithuanian capital of vilnius mrs 
prunskiene told reporters that her meeting with baker gave 
lithuania a boost 
i became convinced again that the usa as well as other 
governments support the restoration of independence and the path we 
are taking she said at the us ambassadors residence where she 
met with baker 
the prime minister said she told baker about lithuanias plan 
and her talks with gorbachev a day earlier 
baker said we had a full discussion on the situation with 
respect to the baltics particularly lithuania we are very 
hopeful as we have been for some time that a dialogue can begin 
it remains to be seen the degree to that which will be continued 
he has said the baltic impasse was casting a shadow over the 
summit later this month in washington between gorbachev and 
president bush 
another us official also speaking anonymously said baker 
told mrs prunskiene a way has to be found to settle the 
dispute 
a recommendation to suspend independence would go a step beyond 
a formula proposed last month by french president francois 
mitterrand and west german chancellor helmut kohl to suspend 
subsequent laws implementing the declaration 
mrs prunskiene also told reporters that gorbachev and premier 
nikolai ryzhkov hinted that stricter economic measures would be 
taken against lithuania if we dont behave more rationally she 
said the soviets did not elaborate 
mrs prunskienes meeting with gorbachev on thursday marked the 
first time the soviet president has sat down with baltic officials 
to discuss their independence drive he has branded their 
declarations of independence void and imposed an economic blockade 
against lithuania 
gorbachev also has ruled parliaments in the the neighboring 
baltic republics of latvia and estonia acted illegally by approving 
declarations calling for independence over a transition period but 
so far he has not invoked sanctions against them 
mrs prunskiene told a news conference that progress was made 
but that the soviets were insisting that lithuania rescind its 
declaration 
prosoviet forces in vilnius stepped up their pressure friday 
thousands of soviet troops remain in lithuania and the republic 
is suffering from an oil and natural gas blockade that gorbachev 
imposed to stop the secession the lithuanian economy is closely 
meshed with that of the soviet union 
in vilnius thousands of antiindependence demonstrators 
demanded the secessionist government resign and that soviet rule be 
restored 
military helicopters dropped leaflets saying down with the 
government of separatists long live soviet lithuania 
supporters of independence gathered around the lithuanian 
parliament building to block any attempt by prosoviet forces to 
occupy it said eduardas potashinskas an editor at lithuanian 
television 
the prosoviet crowds dispersed by evening but proindependence 
guards remained around the building into the night said simas 
ardjiunas a parliamentary spokesman

the nations largest ecumenical group welcomed 
the coming visit of antiapartheid leader nelson mandela to the 
united states but said apartheid should be lifted before south 
africas president is invited 
the national council of churches wrapped up it policymaking 
meeting friday with a resolution criticizing president bushs 
decision to receive south african president fw de klerk 
any signal of support of de klerk will send the african 
national congress a message we are backing away from our call for 
the dismantling of apartheid said the rev tyrone pitts of the 
progressive national baptist convention 
the church council which represents most major anglican 
orthodox and protestant religions but not roman catholics 
comprises 32 denominations with 42 million members 
the council also regretted the us congressional recognition of 
jerusalem as israels capital asked american companies to stop 
buying coffee from el salvador and called for the withdrawal of all 
american soldiers from the philippines by 1996 
the council said jerusalem is threatened by actions favoring one 
religion such as the nonbinding congressional measure 
the city is a focus of deepest religious inspiration and 
attachment of judaism christianity and islam the council said 
the council asked israeli leaders to remove jewish settlers from 
st johns hospice a greek orthodox shelter 
about 150 armed jewish settlers backed by 18 million from the 
israeli government moved in during the week before easter last 
week an israeli court ordered all but 20 settlers to leave until 
the court resolves the issue

said a state could deny jobless benefits to american indians who 
use the hallucinogenic drug peyote in religious rituals 
the council urges its member communions to alert their 
constituents to this incredible loss of protection for religious 
rights because of an aggressive and radical exercise in judicial

muppets creator jim henson died of severe 
pneumonia caused by a rare complication from a common bacteria 
but not as rare as it used to be 
the pneumonia began with an infection with group a streptococcus 
bacteria which cause a wide variety of infections but most are 
mild infections such as sore throat and impetigo said centers 
for disease control spokesman chuck fallis 
cdc researchers cautioned in january that group a streptococcus 
infections have reemerged as a public health problem but the 
atlantabased agency said factors contributing to the apparent 
recent increase are unclear 
among several recent outbreaks of group a streptococcal illness 
was an outbreak of bacteremia a severe bloodstream infection in 
denver last year nineteen cases were confirmed in one hospital in 
the first eight months of 1989 where just three had been reported 
in all of 1987 
those serious bloodstream infections occur in just four or five 
cases per 100000 americans each year fallis said its still 
uncommon of those severe infections only one in five patients 
goes on to develop pneumonia such as henson did 
henson had complained of cold symptoms to a physician cousin the 
weekend before his death wednesday he did not see a doctor for 
treatment until he checked into a new york hospital tuesday 
morning after he began having trouble breathing 
by that point doctors said the bacterial infection from his 
lungs had begun attacking other organs and the illness could no 
longer be controlled with antibiotics 
the fatality rate associated with group a streptococcus 
bacteremia is between 20 percent and 30 percent fallis said 
serious group a streptococcal infections generally occur in 
the elderly or in people with decreased immunity because of an 
underlying illness such as cancer fallis said 
before the recent rise in serious group a streptococcal 
infections they had been less common than in previous generations 
over the past five decades the rate and severity had been 
decreasing fallis said 
infections are usually easily treated if caught in time the 
bacteria are quite sensitive to penicillin

hundreds of students and professors held 
sitins today to protest the nomination of the nations only 
fourstar general as the countrys next prime minister 
but a government spokesman dismissed as hogwash the 
protesters claim that the appointment of defense minister hau 
peitsun as prime minister represents a move toward military rule 
the demonstrations came on the eve of the inauguration of 
president lee tenghui who will be sworn in for a regular sixyear 
term sunday 
earlier this month lee surprised the nation by announcing that 
he would ask hau to head the government the president is expected 
to formally nominate hau as prime minister sunday the appointment 
must be approved by parliament 
during his inauguration lee is also expected to make a major 
policy statement on improving relations with the communist 
government in china he may also announce the release of political 
prisoners 
about 300 students many wearing yellow headbands reading 
oppose military interference in government staged a sitin 
today in the rain at chiang kaishek memorial park to oppose haus 
nomination hundreds more were expected to join the demonstration 
sunday 
meanwhile a sitin at another downtown park by professors and 
artists opposed to hau entered its second day 
haus nomination is not only unconstitutional but 
antidemocratic said chang chungtung a history professor at 
the national taiwan university 
he said it would bring back an atmosphere of fear and 
suppression experienced so painfully by the people in this island 
in the past 40 years of martial law 
the governing nationalist party has gradually eased its 
authoritarian grip on taiwan in recent years lifting martial law 
allowing opposition political parties and giving more government 
posts to native taiwanese who account for 85 percent of the 
islands 20 million people 
but hau belongs to the nationalist old guard that fled to taiwan 
with generalissimo chiang kaishek in 1949 after losing a civil war 
to communist forces on the chinese mainland 
about 20 professors met lee on friday to express their concerns 
and demand an end to the appointment of retired military officials 
to top intelligence diplomatic and media posts 
government spokesman shaw yuming said that nobody in this 
land can turn the clock back he said claims the government 
was moving toward military rule were hogwash nobody would accept 
that 
political observers said haus appointment represents an attempt 
by lee to expand his power base and stem criticism among aging 
nationalist conservatives who have questioned his pragmatic policy 
toward their sworn enemies in beijing 
lee became the first native taiwanese to lead the government in 
january 1988 when he moved up from the vice presidency to succeed 
president chiang chingkuo who died in office chiang was the 
eldest son of chiang kaishek

secretary of state james a baker iii resumed 
negotiations today with soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze in a drive for a ussoviet summit declaration to cut 
nuclear arms 
a working group of us and soviet experts met for three hours 
today in pursuit of an agreement then baker and shevardnadze 
entered the negotiations themselves 
baker had delayed his departure for washington and set up the 
extra meeting amid indication of progress on limiting cruise 
missiles one of the toughest unresolved issues 
we havent closed a senior us official said after baker 
held 10 hours of talks on friday five of them with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev both sides claimed progress 
president bush and gorbachev would like to announce at their may 
31june 3 summit in washington agreement on all the key issues in a 
treaty to reduce the superpowers longrange nuclear missiles 
bombers and submarines 
us and soviet negotiators in geneva would then work at least 
through the summer to complete the details 
the gaps are not seen as being unbridgeable the senior us 
official said at a news briefing held under rules granting him 
anonymity 
he also cautioned reporters i cant tell you we are going to 
get there 
baker had planned to fly home today after a news conference 
announcing the results of his fiveday visit to moscow instead he 
scheduled another meeting with shevardnadze and delayed his 
departure until at least midafternoon 
if you can close obviously you are going to do it the 
senior us official said if you cant its not the end of the 
world 
other american officials gave a more upbeat assessment they 
said baker and shevardnadze had settled most of their differences 
over limiting the ranges of cruise missiles carried aboard planes 
and ships 
a settlement on the elusive nucleartipped weapons would clear 
the biggest obstacle to a treaty cutting the overall arsenals of 
us and soviet longrange nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 35 
percent 
but the officials cautioned that many details still must be 
worked out 
baker and shevardnadze had reported earlier friday that they had 
made progress on the treaty 
i have always believed the main points will be agreed upon 
shevardnadze said things are moving in that direction 
baker after seeing gorbachev told reporters we made some 
progress we still have a number of issues that are still out 
there 
shevardnadze standing at his side chimed in we did a lot 
we accomplished a lot today 
the foreign minister also gave a positive report on negotiations 
to ban the production of chemical weapons asked whether a 
ussoviet agreement was ready for the summit he replied yes 
major progress was made 
bush last week offered to halt the production of us binary 
weapons two chemical potions that become deadly when mixed if 
the soviets were willing to schedule the destruction of their 
poison gas stockpiles shevardnadze gave no details of the emerging 
accord which is also designed for a summit signing 
earlier in the kremlin gorbachev said his side was doing its 
best to stitch together a strategic arms reduction treaty he had 
been accused of backsliding by the bush administration before 
bakers arrival here tuesday 
the soviet leader said he did not know whether the goal of a 
framework agreement would be met but i think we are moving 
closer

president hosni mubarak has completed a 
sixyear process of reconciliation with the soviet union without 
damaging egypts special relationship with the united states 
mubarak returned home with political and economic benefits for 
egypt after a 46hour visit to moscow this week the first by an 
egyptian head of state in 18 years 
he won soviet president mikhail gorbachevs public support for 
his middle east policies it included gorbachevs strong 
condemnation of israel for allowing soviet jewish immigrants to 
settle in occupied arab territories 
the two nations also signed an agreement that holds the promise 
of substantial soviet economic aid for egypt during the 1990s 
perhaps more importantly the improvement in cairomoscow 
relations has not come at washingtons expense 
there was no hint during mubaraks visit of any soviet intent to 
revive the kremlins old role as egypts principal arms supplier a 
function that the united states assumed in 1980 nor was there any 
suggestion of moscow trying to join the united states in current 
middle east peacemaking efforts 
rather mubarak came away with a soviet pledge to support us 
and egyptian efforts to initiate a palestinianisraeli dialogue in 
cairo previously moscows policy focused solely on the 
israelispurned idea of an international middle east peace 
conference 
mubaraks visit came six years after he initiated a policy of 
trying to normalize relations with the soviet union where as a 
young air force officer he trained to be a fighter pilot 
he began by restoring diplomatic representation to the level of 
ambassador later he mended other fences smashed by his 
predecessor anwar sadat 
sadat assassinated by moslem extremists almost nine years ago 
was the last egyptian head of state to visit moscow in 1972 just 
before relations soured first the soviets refused to meet egypts 
arms requests sadat reacted with sweeping reprisals including 
expelling 17000 soviet military personnel 
despite the improvement in relations since 1984 there remained 
what one egyptian official termed a psychological shortcoming in 
terms of the absence of personal facetoface contact at the top 
mubaraks visit to moscow from monday to wednesday sealed that 
breach 
ibrahim nafei editor of cairos leading newspaper alahram and 
a member of mubaraks entourage wrote that the meeting rectified 
the balance of relations and put them in the proper context 
more accurately it codified the relationship on the 
footing of close personal knowledge between the two leaders that 
had been missing 
the visit was part of an asianeuropean tour that also took 
mubarak to china north korea oman and britain 
before setting out mubarak made clear his objectives included 
seeking economic benefits and marshaling opposition to the settling 
of soviet jewish immigrants in the israelioccupied west bank and 
gaza strip 
he evidently succeeded 
in a moscow dinner speech honoring mubarak gorbachev denounced 
settling jewish immigrants among the 17 million palestinians 
living in the west bank and gaza as antisoviet it is part of 
insidious designs by israel he said 
to push emigrants to israel into doing that amounts to 
dangerously and immorally playing with their fates gorbachev 
said 
it was moscows strongest censure of israel since the influx of 
soviet jews began last fall israel captured the west bank from 
jordan and gaza from egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
officials in cairo said the soviets promised to consider 
egyptian ideas on the emigration issue one would grant soviet jews 
the right to return if they find difficulties in israel after 
emigrating another would ask the united states to relax 
restrictions on soviet jewish immigration 
hundreds of thousands of soviet jews are expected to emigrate to 
israel in the next few years as the result of a relaxation of 
travel regulations in the soviet union and a tighter entry quota in 
the united states 
israel says it has no policy of settling the new arrivals in the 
occupied territories 
gorbachev and mubarak also signed a joint declaration that 
reflected an apparent shift by moscow on middle east peacemaking 
the joint declaration clearly gave precedence to usbrokered 
peace talks over an international conference aimed at reaching an 
overall middle east settlement 
the two countries signed a 10year agreement that sets 
guidelines for economic commercial scientific and technological 
cooperation 
under the accord egyptian officials anticipate receiving soviet 
economic aid amounting to 700 million to 800 million they said 
this would include expansion of egypts steel and aluminum 
industries originally built with soviet help and construction of 
new power stations 
in addition the official middle east news agency said saturday 
the soviet union had promised egypt major debt relief that includes 
repayment in goods rather than cash the news agency which did not 
cite its sources said under the agreement egypt would pay only 
about 7 percent of the debts value at the official exchange rate 
beginning after a sixyear grace period 
the news agency said the debt totaled 22 billion rubles or 
358 billion at the official exchange rate

romanians seeking to enter east germany now 
must prove they have a personal invitation from an east german the 
government says 
the tightening of visa requirements on friday was part of an 
effort to stem a flood of refugees from romania 
the move drew criticism however from the east german 
commissioner for foreigners our historic and humanitarian 
responsibility demands more farsightedness said almuth 
berger 
nearly 2000 romanian refugees have been housed at barracks 
buildings around east berlin thousands more are believed inside 
the country and train stations have become homes to hundreds 
the romanians are lured by east germanys imminent unification 
with west germany and are also fleeing political strife and 
uncertainty in their own country 
romanians overthrew communist dictator nicolae ceausescu in a 
bloody december revolution they are scheduled to vote in national 
elections sunday after a campaign that has frequently turned 
violent 
in another move the east german government said it was lifting 
visa requirements for citizens of belgium france luxemburg and 
the netherlands the state news service adn reported the new rules 
allow citizens of those countries to enter without visas and stay 
for up to three months 
the government also was preparing to lift visa requirements for 
citizens of greece great britain ireland sweden norway malta 
portugal and switzerland adn said 
it said the actions were aimed at advancing european unity 
westerners had only limited travel privileges in the country under 
the ousted communist government 
an estimated 500000 east germans fled their own country over 
the past year to escape the former communist government and seek 
prosperity in the west they were taken in by west germany 
their exodus gave rise to east germanys peaceful revolution 
that toppled four decades of communism and led to the nations 
first democratic government 
a flood of romanians poles and other groups into east germany 
in recent months has heightened german resentment of foreigners as 
the nation moves closer to a free market 
the two germanys signed an economic treaty on friday and plan to 
merge their economies by july 2 the merger is expected to force 
many east german factories to close triggering widespread 
unemployment

hundreds of foreign observers spread 
out across the country today to monitor romanias first free 
elections in more than 50 years and several said they were 
checking reports of campaign irregularities 
anticommunist demonstrators continued to defy a ban on 
political rallies before sundays presidential and parliamentary 
elections occupying a downtown square for the 28th straight day 
many of the 700 protesters in the square today said they feared 
the elections would be rigged 
they will fiddle with the votes in the computers and we are 
scared of the outcome said 23yearold beatrice andrei who has 
slept in university square a main traffic artery for 20 days 
gheorghe ivescu a 43yearold engineer said when we come 
out of the polling booth theyll ask us who did you vote for and 
then punch us if we voted against the front 
interim president ion iliescu and his national salvation front 
lead in the campaign for the presidency and seats in a twochamber 
parliament iliescu has two presidential opponents and 82 
opposition parties are fielding slates for parliament 
the front came to power in the violent december revolution that 
ousted communist dictator nicolae ceausescu and the protesters 
accuse it of wanting to retain the communist political system 
the election obervers include a 60member international 
delegation sponsored by the us republican and democratic parties 
institutes for international affairs 
at a news conference friday night several said they were 
investigating reports of intimidation violence and irregularities 
in the campaign which officially ended at midnight thursday 
no one has suggested that the election has been carried 
out without difficulty said roy hattersley a member of the 
british parliament we cant tell the extent of the problems 
every party leader and candidate for president has talked 
about intimidation of himself and his staff hattersley said 
jim king senior vice president at northeastern university in 
boston said even if the number of observers is small their 
presence is crucial 
the world is watching and that has a cooling effect on those 
with hot heads and it gives a powerful push for those people who 
want tolerance and fair elections he said 
king said he believed the government had not done enough to stop 
harassment and intimidation he said he had seen policemen stand by 
and do nothing to halt such acts 
late friday thousands of anticommunist protesters gathered on 
university square in downtown bucharest those remaining early 
today jeered loudly at a tvscreensized movie of iliescu being 
shown on the wall of a building on the square demonstrators have 
occupied the square since april 22 demanding iliescu and other 
former communists quit politics 
polls of uncertain accuracy indicate iliescu a 60yearold 
former communist minister demoted after criticizing ceausescu in 
1971 will get up to 60 percent of the presidential vote his main 
rivals are radu campeanu of the national liberal party and ion 
ratiu of the national peasants party 
the front also expects to win a majority in parliament 
our roundtheclock protest will continue until we get our 
liberty back until democracy is restored in our country protest 
leader dumitru dinca shouted to the demonstrators 
iliescu had said the protesters should be cleaned out of the 
square after the campaign officially closed thursday campaigning 
and political rallies are banned the last two days of the campaign 
but premier petre roman said the government decided to tolerate 
the demonstrators violation of the law for the time being 
in campaign violence thursday in timisoara where the revolution 
began the front and opposition accused each other of inciting 
attacks at a front rally 
the electoral commission said friday that 159 million romanians

a new political alliance has backed lech 
walesa for president in another sign of the growing disagreement 
between the solidarity leader and polands solidaritydominated 
government 
the new group the center alliance was formed by a close walesa 
advisor and favors speeding up economic and political reform 
it also wants polands current president former communist party 
chief wojciech jaruzelski to step aside 
the solidarity government has launched an ambitious 
toptobottom overhaul of the socialist economic system but walesa 
has pressed for an even faster expunging of the former governments 
personnel and policies 
the acceleration we are proposing is to do away with the 
remnants of the old system sen jaroslaw kaczynski who is 
spearheading the new alliance said friday kaczynski is editor of 
the weekly tygodnik solidarnosc and a member of walesas inner 
circle 
the alliance has issued a founding declaration but it is not a 
formal political party 
the split over the pace of reforms goes back to the april 1989 
accord signed by thencommunist authorities and solidarity it 
paved the way for democratic parliamentary elections that led to 
the takeover of the government by solidarity 
but under the accord parliament seats were guaranteed to the 
subsequently dissolved communist party the interior and defense 
ministers were retained from the former government and jaruzelski 
was installed as president to smooth the transition and help 
maintain relations with the soviet union 
with the democratization elsewhere in eastern europe in recent 
months some say the accord is out of date 
the roundtable agreement cannot be binding any longer 
kaczynski said jaruzelski should come to the conclusion that his 
mission is concluded 
jaruzelskis presidential term lasts until 1995 and fully free 
parliamentary voting is not scheduled until 1993 but there is 
pressure from many quarters to speed up the timetable possibly as 
part of a rewriting of the polish constitution 
walesa has fueled the debate with his interest in the presidency 
and his criticism recently more strident of the government of 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki a former solidarity leader 
himself kaczynski said his declaration of support for walesa is 
not a move against mazowiecki 
it is true that there is some argument about whether we should 
continue in small steps or make quick radical changes it is true 
that we differ in our assessment of the situation butwe dont 
want to remove mazowiecki he said 
kaczynski said walesa supports his group but that the alliance 
will not dissolve if he rejects its suggestion that he run for 
president 
our main goal is capitalism kaczynski said

firm hold on carl guenther jr

in the intervening years he escaped from a state prison won 
asylum in his home state of michigan pulled a fat income as the 
owner of a treepruning business got married and raised two 
children 
guenther of port huron mich was 16 years old and working for 
a traveling carnival when he robbed a man of his car at gunpoint in 
montgomery in 1962 authorities said the police caught up with him 
but guenther got loose slipping back to michigan when he was 
released on bond 
in 1965 he was convicted of burglary and served 18 months in a 
michigan prison when he got out alabama authorities said they 
wanted to talk 
they sent me a letter and i bought a bus ticket down here 
guenther 45 said in a recent interview at montgomerys kilby 
correctional center i wanted to get this thing resolved 
a montgomery court did just that convicting him of robbery and 
sentencing him to 25 years on oct 12 1967 according to state 
records a year later guenther broke out with three other inmates 
he lived in new orleans florida and south america then moved 
back home in the 1970s working as a farm manager in benton harbor 
mich before opening a tree service in port huron in 1977 
i was making 50000 or 60000 a year guenther said i 
thought i was a pretty damn productive citizen 
when he was picked up on a traffic violation in 1976 police 
discovered he was wanted in alabama gov george c wallace sought 
his extradition but guenther found help in michigan gov william 
milliken 
mark blumer an assistant michigan attorney general who 
represented alabama in extradition proceedings said an aide to 
milliken recommended asylum while blumer said there was no records 
showing it was formally approved guenther was never extradited 
in 1983 guenther was convicted of drunken driving and wallaces

spokeswoman debbie herbert unless he is paroled he is due to 
finish his sentence on may 22 2003 she said

said he would have been all right if he had been a salesman said 
an official in blanchards office who spoke on condition she was 
not identified 
said blumer as far as we were concerned he was a person who 
had abused a rather extraordinary privilege we were quite pleased 
that alabama still wanted him and we were very happy to send him

breakout 
im not going to try to escape again i wouldnt leave if they

lithuanias prime minister warned lawmakers today 
that if they give in to moscows demand to suspend their 
declaration of independence the baltic republic risks coming back 
under kremlin control 
kazimiera prunskienes comments came as lithuanias parliament 
meeting in emergency session considered compromise proposals that 
leaders of the secessionist republic hope will lead to negotiations 
with the kremlin 
the prime minister briefed lawmakers on her talks in moscow on 
thursday with president mikhail s gorbachev according to rita 
dapkus a spokeswoman for the parliament 
gorbachev said the republics march 11 declaration of 
independence must be suspended which was a softening of his 
original demand to revoke it 
but mrs prunskiene told lawmakers that even suspension would be 
too risky said parliamentary spokesman ed tuskenis 
ms dapkus quoted the prime minister as saying if the 
declaration were suspended lithuania might again be subject to 
soviet law 
the compromise measures being considered by the supreme council 
or lithuanian parliament outline a transition period to full 
independence 
the measures are contingent however on the kremlin beginning 
negotiations with lithuania they do not call for suspending or 
rescinding the republics march 11 declaration of independence 
ms dapkus said the lawmakers were not expected to take any 
action today 
during the session 200 supporters of independence gathered 
outside the building to keep antisecessionists from coming in ms 
dapkus said 
last week antiindependence protesters tried to enter 
parliament buildings in estonia and latvia but police or 
volunteers stopped them 
in an hourlong meeting with mrs prunskiene on friday secretary 
of state james a baker iii urged her to consider suspending the 
declaration according to a us official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
before she returned to the lithuanian capital vilnius mrs 
prunskiene told reporters that her meeting with baker gave 
lithuania a boost 
i became convinced again that the usa as well as other 
governments support the restoration of independence and the path we 
are taking she said at the us ambassadors residence where she 
met with baker 
the prime minister said she told baker about lithuanias plan 
and her talks with gorbachev a day earlier 
baker said we had a full discussion on the situation with 
respect to the baltics particularly lithuania we are very 
hopeful as we have been for some time that a dialogue can begin 
he has said the baltic impasse was casting a shadow over the 
summit later this month in washington between gorbachev and 
president bush 
another us official also speaking anonymously said baker 
told mrs prunskiene a way has to be found to settle the 
dispute 
a recommendation to suspend independence would go a step beyond 
a formula proposed last month by french president francois 
mitterrand and west german chancellor helmut kohl to suspend 
subsequent laws implementing the declaration 
mrs prunskiene also told reporters that gorbachev and premier 
nikolai ryzhkov hinted that stricter economic measures would be 
taken against lithuania if we dont behave more rationally she 
said the soviets did not elaborate 
mrs prunskienes meeting with gorbachev on thursday marked the 
first time the soviet president has sat down with baltic officials 
to discuss their independence drive he has branded their 
declarations of independence void and imposed an economic blockade 
against lithuania 
gorbachev also has ruled parliaments in the the neighboring 
baltic republics of latvia and estonia acted illegally by approving 
declarations calling for independence over a transition period but 
so far he has not invoked sanctions against them 
mrs prunskiene told a news conference that progress was made 
but that the soviets were insisting that lithuania rescind its 
declaration 
prosoviet forces in vilnius stepped up their pressure friday 
thousands of soviet troops remain in lithuania and the republic 
is suffering from an oil and natural gas blockade that gorbachev 
imposed the lithuanian economy is closely meshed with the soviet 
unions 
in vilnius thousands of antiindependence demonstrators 
demanded the secessionist government resign and that soviet rule be 
restored 
military helicopters dropped leaflets saying down with the 
government of separatists long live soviet lithuania 
supporters of independence gathered around the lithuanian 
parliament building to block any attempt by prosoviet forces to 
occupy it said eduardas potashinskas an editor at lithuanian 
television 
the prosoviet crowds dispersed by evening but proindependence 
guards remained around the building into the night said simas 
ardjiunas a parliamentary spokesman

an empty grave is kept ready at the new 
martyrs cemetery to receive the next victim of kashmirs revolt 
against indian rule 
on the topmost branch of an ancient chinar tree a few yards 
away the bright green flag of islam flutters briskly in a light 
breeze that somehow fails to stir the drooping banner of the 
jammukashmir liberation front 
but the spirit of the insurrection is far from sagging despite 
the presence of indian troops on every major street despite 
hospital wards full of people with bullet wounds and beating 
injuries they say the alien soldiers inflicted despite a 
counterinsurgency campaign that has sent leaders of the freedom 
movement into deeper hiding in the tangle of narrow alleyways 
no one doubts there will be more shaheed or martyrs for 
the graves under the chinar tree and the scores of other new burial 
grounds in the kashmir valley below the snowcapped himalayas 
nearly 400 people mostly moslem militants or their supporters 
have been killed since jan 20 when the government began its 
harshest crackdown on the kashmir secessionist movement the 
movement has simmered sputtered or flared for 43 years and 
exploded last winter into assassinations bombings and kidnappings 
the kashmir crisis is a legacy of 1947 when britain left the 
indian subcontinent one of the unruliest expanses of its 
oncemighty empire 
hindus and moslems were unable to reconcile under the banner of 
a single country so the vast territory was partitioned into 
secular india dominated by hindus and the islamic republic of 
pakistan 
both claimed kashmir a predominantly moslem region whose hindu 
maharajah hemmed and hawed until pakistani tribesmen invaded his 
western domains he hastily cast his lot with india 
pakistan and india bisected kashmir two wars failed to settle 
the sovereignty issue and it threatens to drag them into another 
the cry for freedom is heard today throughout srinagar summer 
capital of jammukashmir the only indian state with a moslem 
majority 
it is whispered by shoppers to foreigners who cycle past indian 
guns in the heart of the old city it is spoken with defiance and 
resolution by businessmen doctors and civil servants in homes and 
offices chanted by toddlers prompted by their elders shouted by 
young men rasped by old men and women 
it is categorically rejected by the government of prime minister 
vp singh in new delhi and the appointed governor of 
jammukashmir a toughminded hindu who uses the single name 
jagmohan and sits in the magnificent isolation of an old princely 
residence overlooking dal lake 
our only demand is freedom said hilal ahmad beg we want 
our kashmir 
beg 26 leads the students liberation front which kidnapped a 
moslem university vice chancellor and a hindu industrialist six 
weeks ago and killed them when jagmohan refused to release three 
jailed militants 
instead the governor ordered 15 days of aroundtheclock curfew 
and housetohouse searches he said they resulted in the arrests 
of 836 people ranging from terrorists to people of bad 
character who took advantage of the unrest to commit nonpolitical 
crimes 
all but 249 have been released jagmohan said 
the dragnet missed beg who said the authorities do not have 
have his photograph and he walks unchallenged past indian troops 
indeed he strolled openly though watchfully down a street and 
into a building to meet a reporter for an interview arranged 
through intermediaries 
only three days earlier beg said he led a midday attack that 
killed a paramilitary trooper in the center of srinagar 
the neatly dressed leader of the students liberation front 
readily acknowleged he had been too busy with militant activities 
for the past eight years to enroll anywhere as a student on at 
least three occasions beg said he went to pakistani kashmir for 
up to 3 months of military training 
his group is a wing of the oldest secessionist group the 
jammukashmir liberation front whose leader amanullah khan is 
based in the pakistani part of kashmir 
beg and other militants said the independent kashmir they 
envision should include the predominantly hindu jammu region plus 
both parts of divided kashmir 
their state would be a landlocked enclave bordering 
afghanistan china pakistan and india its main economic base is a 
multimilliondollar tourist business that has evaporated during the 
violence 
frustration with such a limited economy helped spur the revolt 
in srinagar multilingual moslems with university degrees work 
as office clerks and shopkeepers they accuse indian officials of 
reserving a disproportionate share of state government posts for 
hindus 
resentment of the government crackdown feeds the fire of 
independence any conversation with a halfdozen or more people 
seems to produce at least one man or woman who angrily displays 
gashes bruises or castcovered bone fractures blamed on indian 
soldiers or paramilitary forces 
at shms hospital no one calls it sri hari maharajah singh 
hospital a black scrawl on the wall declares long live free 
kashmir the death of the martyr is the life of the nation 
hospital rooms turn into miniature political rallies as 
relatives even strangers visiting patients in other wards crowd

senate conservatives are pushing hard to erase 
a ban on assault rifles from an electionyear crime package set for 
floor action this week 
but the bills supporters have no intention of giving up without 
a fight 
the senate really faces a choice of do we side with the gun 
lobby or do we side with law enforcement said sen paul simon 
dill faced with that choice im going to support law 
enforcement 
police groups have backed the bills ban on sale and manufacture 
of nine types of semiautomatic assault weapons while the national 
rifle association has lobbied to have the provision dropped 
the wideranging package also would authorize the death penalty 
for 30 federal crimes including presidential assassination and 
reshape the sometimes drawnout postappeals process under which 
convicts seek new trials 
it also would fine tune the nations moneylaundering laws and 
reverse attorney general dick thornburghs decision to give local 
us attorneys control over the justice departments 
organizedcrime strike forces 
thornburgh says he revitalized the forces which in recent 
years have put scores of organized crime figures behind bars but 
at least 75 percent of the attorneys have resigned from the units 
since his decision 
the bill has been hanging fire in the senate for months it 
began as part of the bush administrations 1989 anticrime package 
but has since been completely overhauled by senate judiciary 
chairman joseph r biden ddel and other democrats on the panel 
the bush administration now opposes the bulk of the package 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine planned to 
start debate monday with the first votes on what promises to be a 
raft of amendments coming tuesday he set aside the entire week for 
action on the bill and warned that some midnight oil might be 
needed 
supporters and critics alike said the national rifle association 
made headway in its drive to dump the assault weapons provision 
my guess is that it will be knocked out although i will vote to 
keep it simon said 
i think its probably pretty close said sen orrin hatch 
rutah the lobbyings been real hard but i believe we have the 
votes to strike it 
as usual the gun groups rhetoric has been freewheeling and 
muscular nra legislative official wayne lapierre asked members of 
the group in a letter in february 
would you be shocked if i told you that michael dukakis had 
been elected to the united states senate and was on the verge of 
passing a bill to ban guns well that nightmare is not as far from 
the truth as you might imagine 
it said biden and other sponsors are banking on their buddies 
in the national news media saturating the television airwaves 
radio frequencies and magazine racks with hysterical antifirearms 
propaganda 
on the other side handgun control inc has been running 
advertisements showing a sinisterlooking tec9 machine pistol 
labeled a drug dealers best friend handgun control 
spokeswoman gwen fitzgerald said the group hopes to stamp that 
label on any senator who moves to drop the assault weapons 
provision from the package 
they may be able to do it but hopefully well be able to make 
them sorry she said 
the bush administration has been pushing a rival plan that would 
ban domestic assembly of foreign assault weapons and clips of more 
than 15 rounds 
conservatives have been pressing for limits on the postappeals 
process in which convicts can obtain a federal court review of 
their cases and perhaps a new trial by claiming their 
constitutional rights were violated the first time around 
critics of the system point to seemingly endless delays in 
carrying out executions because of almost open ended habeas 
corpus proceedings 
the biden version would tighten the process in some ways but 
open a new opportunity for convicts to claim they had been 
victimized by a miscarriage of justice 
the bill also contains a provision sponsored by sen edward m 
kennedy dmass that would allow those sentenced to death to use 
statistical evidence to show they were victims of discrimination 
against minorities 
conservatives say this racial justice act measure represents 
an indirect attempt to outlaw capital punishment 
meanwhile sen strom thurmond rsc and his allies want to 
add a provision that would permit courts hearing criminal cases to 
consider evidence obtained in searches without warrants 
the biden bill would restate a supreme court decision under 
which evidence may be admitted if obtained with a flawed warrant 
but not if there were no warrant at all

three skinheads admitted they desecrated 100 graves 
at a roman catholic cemetery and tried to make it appear that jews 
carried out the attack to avenge the vandalism of jewish 
cemeteries police said 
the three appeared in court friday and wore masks provided by 
police who feared possible reprisals against the skinheads or 
their families 
they did not enter pleas during their court appearance but 
police said they had confessed 
there has been a series of attacks on jewish cemeteries in 
recent weeks that started in france vandalism since has been 
reported in italy and canada 
in the case in france police said the skinheads wanted people 
to believe the vandalism wednesday night in nantes was committed in 
revenge for the gruesome desecration last week at a jewish cemetery 
in carpentras a corpse there was dug up and impaled on an umbrella 
handle 
slogans painted on graves in the nantes suburb of saint herblain 
included carpentras will be avenged and death to le pen a 
reference to farright leader jeanmarie le pen 
the skinheads all in their early 20s were arrested at their 
homes in nantes late thursday and early friday 
they face sentences of up to two years in prison if convicted on 
the charges of vandalism and provoking racial hatred 
police said people living near the cemetery were awakened by 
noise during the incident and took down the license plate of one of 
the suspects after his arrest he provided the names of his two 
accomplices and the three quickly admitted the acts police said 
the three remain jailed at nantes prison in brittany 
the carpentras case remains unsolved the government said it was 
considering posting a reward a step rarely taken in france 
skinheads in france generally sympathize with neonazi groups 
and have shaved heads or closecropped hair 
in royan a regional government education official served as 
substitute teacher friday for christiane guiard who was severely 
beaten by two masked intruders at her home after she devoted a 
class to the ramifications of the carpentras desecration 
the administrator loic legoherel presented a brief discourse 
on freedom in france to three classes of ms guiard a high school 
history and geography teacher 
violence while always unacceptable is particularly odious 
when it is aimed at teachers for whom freedom of speech is 
essential legoherel said 
about 1500 people attended a rally friday in royan in 
solidarity with ms guiard police said

when president bush went to violencetorn 
colombia to talk about drugs no one worried more about his safety 
than white house physician burton lee 
i thought it was a dangerous play lee says i didnt 
particularly want him to go i thought it was asking for it 
lee and his staff of 16 together with a handful of civilian and 
military surgeons set up a seagoing trauma center on a us 
aircraft carrier it was equipped to deal with casualties up to the 
level of what lee likened to invasion catastrophies 
the wellguarded president was not his only worry 
one of the principal concerns of the people in the white house 
was that we thought the press corps was going to get it i was set 
up for 20 or 30 of the press corps if they had gotten hit he 
says 
to lees relief the facility went unused during the oneday 
presidential trip which ended without violence 
i think it was really quite dangerous and when it was over we 
were all very happy he said in an interview 
the drug summit was by far the biggest operation yet for 
lee the doctor with principal responsibility for the presidents 
health 
it was not the job he had in mind when bush a longtime friend 
tapped him to come to washington 
i wanted something in the drugfighting game he said 
perhaps the drug czar post that went to former education secretary 
william bennett 
but ultimately he gave up his large lymphoma practice at new 
yorks sloan kettering cancer center to become white house 
physician 
as such he or someone from his staff must be within a few steps 
of the president at all times 
he travels with the president aboard air force one he oversees 
the presidents physical exams and mrs bushs he joins bush on 
fishing excursions their shared passion 
and he often pokes into healthcare policy issues that are not 
within the purview of his office earning a reputation in some 
administration quarters as a gadfly one conservative official 
called him a wellmeaning kibitzer 
lee says ministering to bushs health is fairly uncomplicated 
because the 65yearold president is in excellent shape 
during a rapidpaced power walk along the shore of 
kennebunkport maine this winter the 60yearold lee trim and 
fit himself ended up having to hitch a ride in a police car 
because he couldnt keep up with bush 
i got so far behind the police started asking me who i was 
he lamented 
lee is close to both the president and mrs bush and is known as 
a great raconteur 
a lifetime medical professional he has an intensity befitting 
his profession his administration colleagues say perhaps because 
of that he has had a tendency to speak his mind even if it doesnt 
follow the official administration line 
he got into a bit of hot water by revealing that he does not hew 
to the gops antiabortion position he was quoted as suggesting 
the administration used an abortion litmus test in appointing 
highlevel officials and he said that bush would never pick him as 
surgeon general 
explaining the flap now he says i think that the person that 
fills that particular position should agree with the president on 
his stated views on abortion 
working on president reagans aids commission was one of lees 
proudest accomplishments 
he was a key architect of the committees 200page report that 
generated considerable controversy when it was released in june 
1988 
burt was enormously influential and dedicated on the 
committee even though he still had his new york practice said 
polly galt former executive director of the commission he 
really puts his money and time where his mouth is 
lees passion these days is healthcare financing reform a 
topic on which no dramatic steps are expected from the bush 
administration 
since i was originally mainly interested in dealing with 
issues here im trying to spread my wings in this job 
participating on government panels dealing with health care 
financing and liability reform he said

secretary of state james a baker iii said today a 
trailblazing agreement on ussoviet cooperation to ban 
superpower production of chemical weapons will be signed at the 
washington summit 
the two sides have also resolved major disputes on cutting their 
strategic nuclear arms baker announced at a news conference after 
concluding talks aimed at setting the stage for the ussoviet 
summit from may 30june 3 
president bush who was in houston called the development 
encouraging and added that some problems still remain to be 
solved 
its a mixed review right now bush said its interesting 
developments were not sure we know all of it yet 
bakers comments followed four days of intensive negotiations on 
an agenda for the summit that bush will host for soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev 
baker acknowledged failure to bridge differences on reducing 
troops and tanks in europe but otherwise gave a positive account 
of his talks with gorbachev and foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze 
baker said he offered new approaches on cutting conventional 
arms but found our counterparts were unable to respond at this 
time 
looking tired as he prepared to fly home to report to bush 
baker said we have been engaged in some heavy lifting and had 
achieved some real accomplishments he added the results 
make us optimistic we can have a productive summit 
the projected chemical weapons accord is designed to set a 
pattern for 40 nations negotiating a global ban on chemicals 
weapons production the two superpowers would destroy their 
stockpiles over several years some two dozen nations are believed 
to have the capability to produce poison gas 
we have reached agreement on a precedentsetting accord 
baker said i believe that this agreement is very significant 
particularly as it provides a real pathway toward a global ban on 
horrific weapons that we already know from bitter experience 
actually get used he said 
during bakers talks attention was focused primarily on the 
drive for an agreement on reducing us and soviet longrange 
nuclear missiles bombers and submarines 
the goal was a declaration to crown the summit in washington 
while some issues remain baker said he reached agreement with 
the soviets on two of the most vexing problems we have faced 
airlaunched cruise missiles and sealaunched cruise missiles 
a settlement on the elusive nucleartipped weapons would clear 
the biggest obstacle to a treaty cutting the overall arsenals of 
us and soviet longrange nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 35 
percent 
missiles carried on fighter planes would be restricted under a 
complicated formula which equitably meets the needs of both 
sides he said 
as for sealaunched cruise missiles baker said the superpowers 
agreed to a declaration outside the strategic arms reduction treaty 
the declaration will enhance both strategic stability and 
predictability without creating verifications difficulties for 
either side he said

the main issue in next sundays 
presidential elections is whether to negotiate with cocaine barons 
whose henchmen police say have stalked and killed three candidates 
its easy to tell where the four surviving candidates stand 
the two who favor talks with drug traffickers are out kissing 
babies the two who reject negotiations speak only on radio and 
television they make no public appearances and small armies of 
security men surround their homes and offices 24 hours a day 
president virgilio barco who ordered security forces to crush 
the traffickers after a leading presidential candidate was 
assassinated in august has refused to negotiate his four years 
end aug 7 and the constitution does not allow a second consecutive 
term 
the question of negotiations overshadows all others many of 
which also relate to the drug trade 
they include constitutional changes giving the president more 
power to combat traffickers agrarian reform which would split up 
the traffickers vast holdings overhaul of an antiquated judicial 
system and anticorruption measures 
none of the four candidates agreed to be interviewed by the 
associated press 
cesar gaviria and antonio navarro have said they would give no 
quarter to drug traffickers 
both replaced presidential candidates police say were 
assassinated by traffickers gaviria and navarro say they have 
received numerous death threats and have relied largely on free air 
time on stateowned radio and tv stations to get their message to 
the people 
gaviria replaced luis carlos galan of the governing liberal 
party who had urged the government to act against the drug barons 
while there was still time 
galan was shot down aug 18 as he stood on a large wooden 
platform delivering a campaign speech in a lowerclass bogota 
neighborhood about 60 heavily armed security men were in the crowd 
to guard him 
gaviria 43 would be colombias youngest president he is a 
former treasury minister and former minister of government which 
put him in charge of internal security 
he got 51 percent of the vote march 11 in a fiveway party 
contest to choose a single candidate and he is heavily favored to 
win the may 27 election 
about 60 percent of colombias registered voters are liberals 
and roughly 35 percent support the conservative party the 
remainder favor the leftist patriotic union and other small 
organizations 
gaviria does not speak out on drug trafficking but when pressed 
by reporters he pledges to continue the government effort against 
the cocaine gangs 
navarro the other candidate who would give no quarter is a 
disabled former guerrilla of the april 19 movement 
his guerrilla group known as m19 signed a peace agreement 
with the government in march disbanded and became a political 
party the m19 commander carlos pizarro became a presidential 
candidate 
an assassin killed pizarro on a domestic airline flight april 
23 navarro second in command of m19 took his place in the 
presidential race 
navarro also has been the victim of violence a hand grenade was 
tossed into a bar where he and friends had gathered in the western 
city of cali he lost a leg and his rapidfire manner of speaking 
his speech now is hesitant and slurred 
it is unclear whether drug traffickers killed pizarro colombian 
newspapers have made much of his declaration in talks with the 
government last year that he opposed extraditing colombians to the 
united states extradition is the government weapon feared most by 
the traffickers 
pizarro was a nationalist however and declared that colombia 
should solve its own problems he said drug trafficking was no 
exception which would make it appear he was not an ally of the 
cocaine lords 
drug gangs have been killing guerrillas and other leftists since 
the sister of some prominent traffickers was kidnapped about 10 
years ago she was released on payment of 10 million ransom 
semana a colombian news magazine quoted navarro recently as 
saying he opposes extradition because he like pizarro believes 
colombia must solve its own problems he said the governments only 
choice is to fight the traffickers 
a third presidential candidate leftist bernardo jaramillo was 
assassinated march 22 police said he was killed by the medellin 
cartel colombias main cocaine gang 
jaramillo was the candidate of the patriotic union party which 
has said it will not put up another candidate 
rodrigo lloreda one of the candidates favoring negotiations is 
a former foreign minister and is the conservative party candidate 
he has made clear that he would stop extraditing traffickers to the 
united states 
alvaro gomez who also says the government and traffickers 
should talk is the son of laureano gomez who was president in 
195051 he opposes extraditions a former conservative party 
member he leads the independent national salvation movement 
neither lloreda nor gomez has said how he would treat other 
demands of the drug gangs which go beyond insisting merely on a 
halt to extradition 
statements attributed to the traffickers and uncontested by 
them have said the medellin cartel wants to become a political 
force many read that to mean the cocaine barons want to run the 
country

prince idris alsanusi is confident that by 
this time next year hell be on the throne in libya hes so sure 
in fact that he is making the rounds of world capitals to 
introduce himself as libyas future monarch 
idris whose great uncle king idris i was overthrown by col 
moammar gadhafi in 1969 was in washington recently meeting with 
republicans in congress with officials in government and with 
business representatives 
lounging in his hotel suite the pretender to the throne said he 
was making plans for the day gadhafi is overthrown and that day 
he said is near 
we have strong signals from within libya that they want the 
sanusi family to rule he said in an interview he added that an 
underground group of loyalists was defying gadhafis iron rule and 
sending out messages 
western officials are skeptical that an organized opposition 
exists within libya 
idris reasons that gadhafi has been increasingly isolated in 
recent months by a decline in support from the soviet union and 
from east germany and other east european governments which have 
since fallen 
once european governments understand that there is a viable 
alternative to gadhafi idris said they too will isolate him and 
give libyans the impetus to revolt 
gadhafi should go quietly into exile to prevent bloodshed idris 
will head a temporary government until free elections can be held 
the new libya will destroy gadhafis arsenal of chemical weapons 
gadhafi claims there are none give up support for terrorism and 
become a responsible member of the world community 
despite gadhafis autocratic rule and periodic reports that he 
was about to be toppled western and arab diplomats in tripoli see 
no indication he is about to go idris also likely would face a 
challenge from other exiled opposition groups who have failed to 
mount a serious threat to gadhafi partly because of infighting 
idris family derives its legitimacy in part from a direct line 
of descent from the prophet mohammed founder of islam but idris 
describes himself as a moderate moslem and envisages a libya 
tolerant of opposing views and religions 
i may even take a drink once in a while despite islams 
strict prohibition on alcohol he said 
idris who was raised in europe and is fluent in five languages 
has married christian women first an american and then a spanish 
catholic noblewoman daughter of the marquis of leon recently they 
had an audience with pope john paul ii 
idris family left libya without much money but he has gone on 
to do well as an oil consultant for european and middle eastern 
firms and governments 
he was a jet setter until he had to ditch the lear for fear 
gadhafi might try to assassinate him gadhafi once tried to place a 
bomb in his fathers car idris said 
he describes himself as impetuous in his youth when he first 
started to organize an opposition to gadhafi i made the mistake 
of approaching the cia and other agencies he said but now i 
have matured and i know that gadhafi can only be removed by the 
libyan people themselves 
his message to the international business community which has 
substantial investments in libyan oil fields is to refrain from 
interfering in a revolt against gadhafi idris said 
idris said investors want gadhafi to stay in power because he 
gives them exclusive contracts and fat commissions 
a democratic libyan government would reassess its contracts with 
foreign companies he said i say youll have a more healthy 
relationship with us maybe less profit he said 
from washington he travels to east europe where he will offer 
his help in facilitating oil purchases for the newly emerging 
democracies from the persian gulf idris said 
the soviet union which is experiencing a drop in oil 
production has cut exports to its east european clients and is 
demanding payment in hard cash rather than goods and services 
idris said he could use his contacts to obtain easy terms for 
east european oil purchases in the mideast and could eventually 
supply them libyan oil

the three republicans hoping to oust gov 
cecil andrus are vying for a shot at a democrat whose popularity in 
gop idaho is formidable after three terms as governor and four 
years in jimmy carters cabinet 
their challenge is further complicated by an economic resurgence 
in idaho reminiscent of the boom times of the 1970s when andrus 
served his first two terms as governor 
challengers looking for a flaw have focused on what they contend 
is andrus increasingly imperial demeanor charging he has become 
arrogant and out of touch with the people and their needs 
andrus who has no democratic opposition in tuesdays primary 
has emphasized the states accomplishments during his tenure he 
also has tried to counter his opponents efforts to paint him as 
out of touch with idahoans 
the people of idaho know me pretty well he said in 
announcing his reelection bid they know what i stand for and 
what we have accomplished together 
andrus first served as idahos governor from 1971 to 1977 when 
he began a fouryear stint as carters interior secretary after 
several years on the political sidelines he was elected to his 
third term as governor in 1986 
this years race for the gop gubernatorial nomination has been 
fraught with personal missteps that have left no clear frontrunner 
and a sense of frustration among party officials looking toward the 
general election 
in the campaigns closing days observers saw the potential for 
milton erhart a boise stockbroker and relative political newcomer 
to emerge from the pack especially if there were a large primary 
turnout 
the other two gop candidates are rachel gilbert a state senator 
and real estate broker and roger fairchild a former state senate 
majority leader and apple processor 
erhart 49 has stressed his prochoice stand on abortion as a 
fundamental difference between himself and the other republicans 
im right where the people are erhart said contending his 
opponents represent the more traditional conservative wing of the 
gop in idaho 
the party has changed he said its much more moderate 
and much more mainstream i dont think they represent the majority 
of the republican party 
erharts position on abortion could hurt him with gop primary 
voters but may allow him to undercut what could be a major base of 
support for andrus in november 
andrus prochoice support is predicated largely on the 
governors march veto of a bill that would have created the 
nations most restrictive state abortion law 
antiabortion forces have targeted andrus for defeat but 
prochoice activists have vowed to work just as hard to support him 
fairchild 37 calls himself a progressive conservative and 
has based his candidacy on a commitment to idahos infrastructure 
but his campaign has been plagued by his admitted use of 
marijuana as a youth allegations of abuse from his exwife and 
what he contends have been misinterpretations of his attempts at 
humor on the stump 
among them were his declaration that he would have signed the 
antiabortion legislation andrus vetoed in a babys heartbeat 
on another occasion he said you can make love to small animals 
or large men but if you have sex with a woman and get her 
pregnant you have a responsibility 
mrs gilbert 59 has picked up the nickname attila the hen 
for her caustic debating style in the idaho senate she has made 
the image of andrus as an arrogant aloof chief executive a 
consistent theme of her candidacy 
her primary issue has been a call for state tax cuts which she 
pushed unsuccessfully in the 1990 legislature as it decided how to 
spend a 126 million state budget surplus

a us ban on south african diamonds would be 
futile because they can be sold through other countries with false 
papers a congressional study says 
the general accounting office said debeers central selling 
organization the worlds main buyer of rough diamonds has refused 
requests from us buyers to identify stones from south africa 
debeers also mines almost all south african diamonds its 
stockpile was estimated as worth 3 billion last year 
japan spends more on diamond jewelry than any other nation and 
the japanese buy the choicer kinds in 1988 they provided 31 
percent of the industrys estimated 43 billion income 
the us share of the purchases was only slightly smaller 30 
percent americans bought more than twice as many pieces as the 
japanese 
the gao which is the investigative arm of congress presented 
its report last month to sen edward kennedy dmass a prominent 
advocate of sanctions against south africa to compel abolition of 
race laws there the report was given to reporters last week 
it said that to keep prices high debeers sells rough diamonds 
only to about 150 buyers many of them in antwerp belgium many of 
the diamonds are also cut in antwerp and others in new york 
bombay india and tel aviv 
the report said debeers could sell the rough diamonds in 
antwerp where false documents could be created for shipments to 
this country it said the belgian government does not ask importers 
where their diamonds came from 
it is likely that a ban on south african diamonds would 
encounter widespread evasion through false country of origin 
certificates for imported diamonds the gao said 
the ga0 quoted an indian merchant who said traders got around an 
indian government ban against south african diamonds by using such 
false certificates he said debeers shipments to india came with 
papers claiming the country of origin was unknown 
the report suggested that a ban might be easier to enforce 
through agreements between the united states and the governments of 
countries where most of the cutting is done israel india and 
belgium such agreements were made to prevent nickel mined in cuba 
from entering this country 
it said the agreements would work only if the governments 
persuaded debeers to separate the stones that come from south 
africa it added that if debeers refused the cutters might buy 
directly from other diamondproducing countries these include the 
soviet union brazil guyana and venezuela as well as several 
african countries 
it pointed out that direct sales would loosen debeers control 
direct sales could increase the producing countries profits 
while cutters and consumers could benefit from lower prices it 
added 
the report also told kennedy that sanctions in general had 
little effect against namibia in the years before it achieved 
independence from south africa though it did raise prices for 
imported goods most of those goods came from or through south 
africa 
the gao said now that sanctions have been lifted against 
namibia it may become a path for avoiding sanctions against south 
africa they pointed out that namibias main port walvis bay 
remains under south african control 
south african goods could be labeled as coming from namibia and 
imports banned to south africa could be reshipped from namibia

election officials 
agreed to review vote totals in the tight presidential race after 
challenger juan bosch said vote fraud had occurred and threatened 
to lead street protests 
former president jimmy carter an election observer helped 
persuade bosch and incumbent president joaquin balaguer on friday 
to accept the review and bosch called off the planned 
demonstrations 
by noon today only 90 percent of ballots were counted from 
wednesdays election the central election board said balaguer 
83 a fivetime conservative president clung to a 14880vote 
lead the results showed 
balaguer had 592554 votes and bosch 577674 with 5905 of the 
6663 polling stations reporting official results showed jose 
francisco pena gomez a former socialist mayor of santo domingo 
was a distant third with 388315 
pena gomez a former bosch protege was thought to have been 
instrumental in getting the agreement for the electoral review he 
had warned bosch that street demonstrations could lead to a 
bloodbath 
bosch 80 a former president who was overthrown in a 1963 
military coup has claimed colossal fraud a charge that has 
not been substantiated 
pena gomez late friday said there were widespead irregularities 
mainly in the vote count in the capital santo domingo he did not 
elaborate further 
carter met with both leading candidates friday to come up with 
the agreement to examine vote totals 
he told reporters the main presidential candidates approved the 
procedure under which copies of tally sheets obtained by political 
parties from polling stations will be checked against tallies 
received by the electoral board the process could take several 
days 
any fraud or honest errors will be discovered and resolved 
said carter reading in spanish from a statement signed by him and 
froilan tavares the election board president 
a bosch spokesman leonel fernandez had accused the electoral 
board of selectively announcing voter returns to prepare public 
opinion for a fraudulent balaguer victory bosch had claimed before 
the election that balaguer had 300000 fake ballots to rig the 
election an accusation balaguer denied 
carter one of 30 international election observers said that 
neither bosch nor any of the candidates presented to me any 
evidence of fraud 
the election is carters third in latin america in a year he 
presided over election monitoring efforts in the may 1989 vote in 
panama and the feb 25 balloting in nicaragua in which voters 
ousted the sandinistas from power 
balaguer and bosch were locked in their fifth race for the 
presidency of this caribbean nation of 7 million people balaguer 
won three of the four previous races 
an army intelligence agent was beaten friday outside the 
headquarters of boschs dominican liberation party where about 200 
supporters had gathered to greet the candidate the partys vice 
president elfidio baez said the agent pulled a gun on bosch but 
the army denied it 
bosch who describes himself as a marxist but not a communist 
campaigned on a moderate platform promoting freeenterprise 
solutions to the countrys serious economic problems 
balaguer now blind from glaucoma was first elected president 
in 1966 and served three consecutive fouryear terms before losing 
in 1978 he was reelected in 1986 
balaguer has sought to capitalize on a 2 billion publicworks 
project that has created thousands of new jobs but the project has 
fueled inflation and the country is plagued by electricity 
blackouts and water shortages

for black teenager yusuf hawkins the 
bensonhurst neighborhood of brooklyn was an ugly place where he was 
killed by an angry white mob 
for sharon woolard who also is black bensonhurst is a pleasant 
place where whites welcomed her with gifts of vegetables just a 
week before hawkins was killed around the corner from her apartment 
so when she heard that neighbor keith mondello had been found 
innocent friday of murder charges in hawkins death she smiled 
thats all i wanted to know hes a nice kid my son loves 
him he always plays with him ms woolard said 
mondello 19 was found guilty of lesser charges a day earlier 
codefendant joseph fama 19 was convicted of seconddegree murder 
for residents inconsistencies between the hawkins case and the 
way they see new residents such as woolard treated are enough to 
convince them bensonhurst is painted with too wide a brush when it 
is called racist 
decades ago bensonhurst a south brooklyn neighborhood of 
modest rowhouses and small apartment buildings was exclusively 
populated by whites but that has changed in the past decade 
its a melting pot here said lisa galarza who is puerto 
rican she also lives on the same block as mondello and around the 
corner from where hawkins died 
bensonhurst isnt predominantly white its a shame 
bensonhurst got a bad name because its a nice place to raise 
kids she said 
her neighbors she added include asians blacks colombians 
arabs and jews just to name a few 
theyre labeling the whole neighborhood as racist said jay 
shah 33 an immigrant from india who moved to bensonhurst two 
years ago i dont think thats right 
people who dont live here have a misconception about this 
whole bensonhurst neighborhood they think its unsafe for 
nonwhites to come here he said 
maria gonzalez 25 a hispanic woman who moved to bensonhurst 
two years ago said she considers mondello and the others to be 
friends and likes that they sometimes play with her 2yearold son 
they love him and hes half black she said they play 
ball with him if these people were racists i wouldnt live in 
this neighborhood 
prosecutors say hawkins was killed last august by a mob of 
whites armed with baseball bats and a gun who mistook hawkins and 
his three friends for blacks who they thought were coming to the 
neighborhood to fight 
the guy was in the wrong place at the wrong time ms 
gonzalez said 
bensonhurst like many other new york neighborhoods is a place 
where children sometimes grow up too quickly 
some youngsters use profanity freely in the calmest of 
conversations and are quick to take on any challenge 
on friday a 10yearold boy became angry at two other boys of 
about the same age and stood on his porch with a beer bottle he 
smashed the bottle against a wall and a porch railing then threw 
the pieces at the other boys they laughed and were not hit 
then the boy on the porch took a 4foot stick and chased the 
others down the street 
cmon over here children he taunted them 
i dont come to dogs dogs come to me one of the boys 
answered 
emilio dellosso 58 said youths in bensonhurst have always 
protected their turf and sometimes armed themselves with bats but 
said it was never racially motivated 
he called bensonhurst one of the best neighborhoods you can 
live in 
why do they knock the whole neighborhood he asked its 
ridiculous 
ms woolard said she will continue to live in bensonhurst with 
her 1yearold daughter and 15yearold son 
she recalled fondly the day shortly after she moved in when two 
italian neighbors brought her vegetables as a welcome gift 
i loved the neighborhood she said i was welcomed with 
open arms

the hubble space telescope the most powerful 
astronomical observatory ever lofted into orbit takes its first 
picture of the heavens sunday 
the national aeronautics and space administration announced 
saturday that engineers had completed the early part of an 
elaborate checkout of the 15 billion telescope and would open a 
shutter on one of its cameras on sunday for a wideangle photo of a 
distant cluster of stars 
traditionally a new telescopes initial glimpse of the heavens 
is called the first light for hubble the first light will 
have traveled across space for more than 12 centuries before 
reaching the orbiting telescope 
engineers expect to receive the photo on the ground at 149 pm 
edt and release prints at the goddard space flight center in 
maryland 
space officials warned that the first effort will not represent 
the telescopes best work nor will the photo have any great 
scientific value but first light will mark completion of weeks 
of work by engineers to test focus and align the 25000pound 
telescope 
we will consider it a total success if the first picture that 
comes down is as good as a groundbased exposure said ed weiler 
nasas space telescope program scientist youll hear a lot of 
cheering when that happens 
weiler said the only real value of the first light photo is as 
a useful engineering test 
i guess to the public it has become an historic event he 
said in an interview friday we will probably not learn anything 
of scientific value because the telescope is not performing 
anywhere near its eventual value 
nasa engineers believe that hubble with its 945inch diameter 
mirror and powerful lightamplifying and focusing equipment 
eventually will take photos of stars that are 25 times fainter than 
the dimmest object visible from earth pictures from hubble are 
expected to have 10 times the clarity of photos taken by the most 
powerful groundbased telescopes 
testing and tuneup of the telescope are expected to continue for 
another seven months or so only then will hubble begin what 
experts believe will be a 15year mission of astronomical 
exploration and scientific discovery 
hubble was carried into space last month by space shuttle 
discovery on april 25 it was plucked from the shuttles cargo bay 
and left to orbit on its own 381 miles above the earth 
from this vantage point the telescope is above the earths 
atmosphere which obscures the stellar view for instruments on the 
ground astronomers expect the hubble will be able to study stars 
at the depths of the universe some 14 billion light years away 
the telescope engineering checkout encountered a series of 
difficulties including a stillunsolved jitter that delayed the 
first light picture for weeks 
jean olivier a marshall space flight center engineer and deputy 
director of the hubble orbital checkout said the telescopes 
jitter or oscillation will be solved soon 
its just considered a headache he said we know with the 
activities coming up in the next few weeks we will have it under 
control 
hubbles first light picture will be a one second exposure of a 
star cluster called theta carina the target can be seen only south 
of the equator and is part of a constellation called carina a word 
that means ships keel 
the star cluster identified in the new general catalogue of 
stars as 3532 is thought to be 3 billion years old its distance 
from earth is about 1260 light years or 7400000000000000 
miles 
a wide field camera one of five instruments in the telescope 
will capture the image and store it in a tape recorder on board it 
will be sent in the form of electronic bits through a relay 
satellite to the goddard space flight center 
computers at goddard will assemble a picture from the electronic 
bits take out any stray background signals and send a visual 
image to a screen 
and astronomers of today will then be able to analyze light that 
erupted from theta carina in about the year 730 ad more than 
eight centuries before the first telescope was invented

david and ginger twitchell have held hands and 
listened while prosecutors press their claim that the christian 
science couple recklessly caused their 2yearold sons death by 
withholding medical treatment 
the trial is being closely watched by the christian science 
church based in boston and by others who say it represents a 
conflict between religious freedom and child protection 
four years ago robyn twitchell died in the twitchells hyde 
park home after five days of illness an autopsy revealed the boy 
had a birth defect called meckels diverticulum which caused a 
blockage in his bowel two years later manslaughter charges were 
filed against the parents 
what is at issue in the trial is whether the parents both 
longtime christian scientists acted recklessly in relying solely 
on prayer to heal the boy 
christian scientists believe that physical disease and sin can 
be healed by spiritual means alone church members may seek out 
special christian science practitioners for help in praying for 
health 
the twitchells response to their childs suffering has become 
one of the early issues in their complicated manslaughter trial 
which enters its third week of testimony monday 
special prosecutor john kiernan has asked several witnesses 
about twitchells demeanor when his son was dying and some have 
testified that he was expressionless 
under questioning witnesses also have said that mrs twitchell 
wears glasses and that her husband sought dental treatment for 
himself 
in often stomachchurning detail prosecution witnesses have 
described what robyn might have felt during his last day from 
agonizing pain to frequent vomiting medical experts have also 
testified the boys life could have been saved by medical 
intervention almost up until the end 
in crossexamination defense attorneys rikki klieman and 
stephen lyons have hammered at the prosecutions medical experts in 
efforts to prove that medical science is not exact and that a 
doctor could not have guaranteed robyns life 
they have sought to show that robyns symptoms resembled the flu 
and that he died suddenly while cradled in his fathers arms on 
the day of his death it appeared to one and all there was 
nothing seriously wrong with this child klieman said 
christian science practitioner nancy calkins who treated robyn 
with prayer testified that the boy was playing with the family cat 
less than an hour before his death 
i think thats pure fantasy dr william hardy hendren 
testified as a medical expert he is chief of surgery at bostons 
childrens hospital 
church officials say christian science itself is on trial 
klieman has moved for a mistrial arguing that the prosecutions 
questions were improperly aimed at analyzing religious doctrine 
kiernan has said the state is not challenging the christian 
science faith but attempting to protect children who are too young 
to make religious decisions for themselves i applaud 
enthusiastically the value and use of spiritual healing it is the 
exclusion of medical science that creates the problem he said 
kiernan closely questioned calkins about the role of prayer in 
healing often citing quotations from mary baker eddy who founded 
christian science more than a century ago seeking to show church 
members can seek medical help without being excommunicated or 
ostracized 
asked to explain what she did for church members she said if 
theyre in pain i just take up the work if they want christian 
science help for a stubbed toe or a severed hand they will have it 
from me truth will heal a stubbed toe or a severed arm 
klieman said kiernans questions took mrs eddys teachings out 
of context the central core of christian science is spiritual 
healing she said the church is not some fringe cult group 
it is been an established church for 100 years 
the courtroom has been packed for nearly every session 
attracting church officials and rita swan a former christian 
scientist and the founder of child a iowabased group that seeks 
prosecution of parents who withhold medical treatment of children 
for religious reasons

days after hurricane hugo smashed into 
this city a banner appeared on the side of a pastel building on 
the edge of calhoun square 
the opera aint over till the fat lady sings it said 
and were not going to let her sing 
the banner which remains until this day reflects the spirit of 
this city as well as of the organizers of spoleto festival usa 
as if to prove charleston has recovered from the ravages of the 
storm the curtain rises this week on the most ambitious spoleto in 
the 14year history of the american arts festival 
the storm has not been able to allay the enthusiasm about the 
festival which is keeping pace with last years record box 
office general manager nigel redden said 
the sept 21 hurricane which packed 135 mph winds and a 12foot 
tidal surge damaged hundreds of buildings tore off roofs and 
toppled trees throughout the area repairs have been made and the 
historic district where the festival events are staged has been 
cleaned 
the festival which opens friday and runs through june 10 
features more than 110 performances offering a little bit of 
everything from grand opera to multimedia events and some old 
favorites 
the festival was brought to charleston in 1977 by composer gian 
carlo menotti he founded the festival of two worlds in spoleto 
italy in 1957 with the aim of merging the cultural worlds of 
europe and america 
in a departure from tradition the first major event of the us 
festival this year is not an opera but a gala concert to celebrate 
the hurricane recovery 
the friday evening event which has been sold out for weeks 
will feature beethovens symphony no 7 and will be conducted by 
leonard bernstein 
one of the most extravagant events at this years festival will 
be a fivehour production of richard wagners opera parsifal 
directed by menotti 
the production which will be staged twice during the festival 
begins in the late afternoon and features a dinner break where 
operagoers will be able to eat in a medieval setting 
its one of the great masterpieces of theatrical repertory 
menotti said its a very exciting theatrical experience 
exciting not only because its full of magic its full of 
theatrical tricks 
the pulitzer prizewinning menotti also will direct a revival of 
last years hit the marriage of figaro this seasons version 
will be staged with a new cast and the sets have been redesigned 
because the old ones were damaged in the hurricane 
national publicity about charleston after the hurricane may be 
helping the box office said festival spokeswoman ann wilson 
ticket sales are running neck and neck or a little better than 
last year when a record 148 million in tickets were sold 
the media attention seems to be focused a bit more heavily on 
the festival this year she said i have newspapers coming to 
cover the festival who have not been for some time i think thats 
one of the positive spinoffs of the hurricane 
i hope its going to show everybody that charleston is fine 
and you can still come and its still pretty and all the buildings 
arent lying in a heap in the streets

vietnam on saturday celebrated the 
centenary of the birth of ho chi minh the fraillooking 
revolutionary who spurred a ragtag army to victory over the forces 
of france and the united states 
although he died before the war ended in 1975 uncle ho who 
preached a blend of confucianism and communism was the driving 
force behind hanois war effort 
but hos hopes for a peaceful and prosperous postwar state were 
never realized the country today faces growing economic woes 
political isolation and the continuing war in neighboring cambodia 
sparked by vietnams 1978 invasion 
the official voice of vietnam radio devoted a halfhour tribute 
to ho on the 100th anniversary of his birth playing music 
dedicated to the great national hero 
it aired a recording of hos declaration of the founding of 
communist north vietnam in september 1945 which the radio called 
the most emotional moment in his life 
nationwide celebrations saturday included cultural festivals 
parades mass meetings and the unveiling of memorials to ho the 
official media said 
western analysts have pointed to the darker side of hos 
leadership including the land reform program in the 1950s in which 
up to 50000 people died 
but in vietnam any public criticism of ho is unlikely 
dissenters are virtually without voice 
an american who was recently held in vietnam for alleged 
antigovernment activities said security officials anticipated 
possible trouble on the anniversary and were arresting dissidents 
in saigon the former south vietnamese capital it was renamed ho 
chi minh city by the communists 
born in nghe an in central vietnam in 1890 ho was the son of a 
poor but educated father who schooled him in confucian philosophy 
and patriotism 
ho went to paris as a student in the early 1920s and was caught 
up in radical politics with lenins work as his inspiration he 
vowed to fight to liberate vietnam from french colonialists 
he founded the indochinese communist party in 1930 and was 
tutored by both soviet and chinese communists in 1941 he found the 
vietminh front the backbone of the guerrilla insurgency that 
defeated the french in 1954 and the usbacked south vietnam 
government in 1975 
both the french and the americans found him a brilliant 
strategist and a ruthless relentless opponent 
the war may last five years 10 or 20 years he said before 
his death in september 1969 hanoi haiphong and a number of 
municipalities and enterprises may be destroyed but the vietnamese 
people are not afraid 
when we achieve victory he boasted the vietnamese people 
will build their country bigger and more beautiful 
but today the official vietnam media almost daily bemoan the 
corruption food shortages and crumbling state enterprises 
and the countrys isolation is growing despite a troop pullout 
from cambodia last year that eased some of the concerns of the 
west its traditional allies the soviet union and the eastern 
europe countries have significantly reduced aid 
in recent months vietnam with its continued hardline 
adherence to socialism found itself out of step with the 
democratic changes elsewhere 
in a gathering in hanoi to mark the ho centenary vietnams 
communist party chief nguyen van linh insisted friday that the 
country would continue to adhere to hos objectives 
despite the current serious challenges socialism is bound to 
overcome immediate difficulties and prevail the official vietnam 
news agency quoted him as saying 
the report seen here saturday said senior representatives from 
the soviet union laos cambodia and india attended the gathering 
india is the only major noncommunist country friendly to hanoi 
on this solemn occasion our entire party and people further 
reaffirm the determination forever to follow the path that 
president ho chi minh has chosen said linh whose 3yearold 
administration has made westernstyle economic changes but avoided 
substantial political ones 
a us private humanitarian agency the international mission of 
hope said it too had plans to commmemorate the anniversary of 
hos birth it was opening a health clinic saturday at the wartime 
massacre site of my lai village

son four times a year but she never mails the letters 
she leaves them beneath panel no 32 of the vietnam veterans 
memorial where her sons name is permanently engraved in black 
granite 
wimbish a 63yearold great grandmother from glen burnie md 
began writing the unmailed letters to her son william reed 
spanky stocks after he was killed in a helicopter crash in 
vietnam on feb 13 1969 for years she told no one of the letters 
she wrote in the wee hours of the morning to comfort herself 
but in recent years her letters have been published in numerous 
books and magazines next week one of the letters will be read 
during public televisions live memorial day evening broadcast of a 
national symphony concert on the us capitol grounds 
in the letters wimbish often discusses childhood memories of 
her son and the kindnesses his fellow military buddies have shown 
her through the years 
this writing is my way of coping with the pain wimbish 
said after leaving a letter at the memorial earlier this month on 
what would have been stocks 43rd birthday my son warmed his way 
into everyones heart he was very special 
stocks nicknamed spanky by his comrades in vietnam died at 
age 21 the blades of his helicopter cut into the aircraft leaving 
stocks severely injured he died about half an hour later 
his body was returned to the united states in a glasscovered 
casket wimbish explained that all bodies deemed viewable were 
placed in such caskets 
i didnt have to wonder like others who only got pieces 
back wimbish said clutching her handbag and fighting back tears 
during a recent interview i hope you know im going to go home 
and bawl like crazy but thats ok its worth it its worth it

a reputed top member of the medellin drug 
cartel was convicted today of two counts of drug conspiracy 
jose abellosilva who was extradited from colombia last fall 
was convicted on federal counts of conspiracy to import drugs into 
the united states and conspiracy to possess drugs with intent to 
distribute 
prosecutors alleged abello was a ranking member of the medellin 
drug cartel and one of the top drug offenders brought to the united 
states under a new extradition treaty with colombia 
he faces up to 8 million in fines and up to 30 years in prison 
jurors whose identities were withheld for security reasons 
returned the verdicts 45 minutes after convening today they had 
deliberated since thursday 
many jurors clenched their fists and wrung their fingers while 
the foreman identified only as juror no 7 read the guilty 
verdicts 
defense attorney richard haynes who was given until june 1 to 
file an appeal and fellow defense attorney patrick williams said 
they met with abello following the verdict 
i had a very emotional conference with our client williams 
said i told him what were going to do hes emotional hes 
hurt i imagine hes just a little bit frightened that so much is 
going on that he doesnt know about 
as he looked up at us he said it just isnt fair it just 
isnt fair 
us attorney tony graham called the verdict a thoughtful one 
and praised jurors and authorities for their efforts 
abello was indicted in tulsa in 1987 and was extradited oct 29 
from bogota colombia 
abello was tried here because of phone calls and money exchanges 
between groups in tulsa and florida that allegedly helped raise 
money for a man who was jailed in tulsa at the time 
graham said some proceeds from a cocaine shipment were to have 
been used to raise money for the man a plot to ship a quantity of 
cocaine for that purpose never was carried out 
prosecutors called 23 witnesses over five weeks 
among the evidence was a recording secretly made by an fbi 
informant during a meeting in florida of a confessed smuggler 
discussing plans he had made with abello in aruba to import cocaine 
prosecutors contend abello and the smuggler agreed at the 
meeting in aruba to ship 500 kilograms more than half a ton of 
cocaine into the united states 
abello has admitted attending the meeting but said he stormed 
out of the room when the conversation turned to drugs

communist rebels on saturday 
denounced the governments decision to continue talks on the future 
of us military bases as an affront to national sovereignty and 
vowed to intensify their struggle 
also saturday defense secretary fidel ramos said the 
philippines must prepare for the possibility the bases will close 
and appealed for greater military cooperation among noncommunist 
nations of southeast asia 
the executive committee of the banned communist party of the 
philippines issued the condemnation one day after philippine 
officials accepted us promises to work for increased aid and 
agreed to further talks on extending the bases after the lease 
expires next year 
in the statement the rebels urged a struggle to stop the 
latest sellout of the national sovereignty in exchange for the 
right price 
it vowed to fight to prevent the us imperialists the 
government of president corazon aquino and other local traitors 
from reaching an accord on the bases 
five days of preliminary talks on the bases ended friday with 
the two sides agreeing to continue negotiations but setting no date 
for the next round 
the talks are to determine whether the united states can 
continue using clark air base the subic bay naval base and four 
smaller installations after the current agreement expires on sept 
16 1991 
a week ago on the eve of the talks communist rebels killed two 
american airmen near clark and threatened further attacks on 
americans until all 40000 us troops defense department 
civilians and military dependents leave the philippines 
a regional military commander said friday that troops had 
arrested three suspected members of the marxist new peoples army 
one of whom may have been involved in the killing of the two 
americans 
in washington the pentagon announced friday that us military 
and defense department civilian personnel in the philippines will 
get pay increases because of unstable conditions here 
the imminent danger pay amounts to a 15 percent increase in the 
basic salary for civilian employees and 110 per month extra for 
all military personnel the statement said 
in a speech saturday to graduates of the militarys command and 
general staff college ramos said removal of the american bases 
would force members of the association of southeast asian nations 
to increase defense spending 
the association or asean includes brunei indonesia malaysia 
the philippines singapore and thailand 
it would be reasonable to expect that the closure of the bases 
will result in asean countries doubling their efforts to protect 
their own interests ramos said 
ramos said that even if a new bases agreement can be reached 
the us facilities cannot permanently remain as a fixture of our 
national territory 
the wisdom of pursuing a selfreliant defense posture is 
selfevident he said

president bush said today there are encouraging 
developments from ussoviet arms talks in moscow but some 
problems still remain to be solved 
its a mixed review right now the president told reporters 
when asked if he had an update from secretary of state james a 
baker iii on his talks with soviet president mikhail gorbachev and 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
bush made his comments before heading off to inspect flood 
damage in texas on a fourday western trip 
he spoke after baker told a news conference in moscow that a 
trailblazing agreement on ussoviet agreement to ban 
superpower production of chemical weapons would be signed at the 
washington summit at the end of the month 
baker said the two sides have also resolved major disputes on 
cutting their strategic nuclear arms he acknowledged failure to 
bride differences on reducing troops and tanks in europe but 
otherwise gave a positive account of the talks 
bush said he and his national security adviser brent scowcroft 
had just been discussing the latest developments 
its interesting developments he said were not sure we 
know all of it yet its encouraging 
he added some problems still remain to be solved

flooding has caused at least 13 deaths in texas as dozens of 
square miles have been inundated 
bush said friday night that the losses have been heavy but 
one thing that comes through to me from talking to my friends is 
that this state will never lose its soul he said he lauded 
the indomitable spirit of texans 
the president was completing his day by addressing evening 
commencement ceremonies at the university of texas in austin 
bush arrived in texas on friday for a 15 million fundraising

gubernatorial candidate clayton williams 
williams an oil millionaire whose campaign has been marked by a

governors office and stamp his brand of leadership on the texas of 
the 90s 
he said texas republicans are blowing away the stuffiness of 
irrelevant liberalism because your new breeze carries the new 
ideas texas need for the 90s ideas that encourage investment in 
business and in the business of our children education

the mormon church rejected polygamy 100 
years ago under federal pressure and still excommunicates known 
polygamists but the state ignores the practice that a historian 
says is healthy and alive and well 
practitioners defend polygamy and its roots in mormon 
fundamentalism and have forged alliances they say are stronger 
than ever before 
they have to make more sacrifices and learn more about their 
beliefs to sustain a defense than anyone else does said ogden 
kraut a polygamist with five wives said in a telephone interview 
last week 
and in doing so they become stronger in their convictions 
he said i think its more rooted in now than it ever was 
with roughly 30000 men women and children living in polygamy 
communities the practice is healthy and alive and well and 
its everywhere said historian martha sonntag bradley 
she estimates the polygamist community is doubling every decade 
both from the birthrate and conversion 
this year marks the 100th anniversary of the manifesto in 
which church president wilford woodruff advised the faithful to 
abandon the practice of men taking multiple wives a practice 
introduced by church founder joseph smith 
the federal government had threatened to seize church property 
in the utah territory if the mormons failed to observe 
antipolygamy laws woodruff feared continuing the practice would 
imperil the mormons hopes for statehood 
from then until now staunch believers have rejected the 
decision to remove polygamy from the doctrines of the church of 
jesus christ of latterday saints 
it is a stance that has driven many mormon fundamentalists to 
remote enclaves in utah idaho montana arizona and mexico 
others have kept their beliefs and actions secret 
if you believe in the lord jesus christ and believe that the 
prophet joseph smith was his representative on earth how in the 
world can you go around saying we have to correct their mistakes 
this we cannot do said owen allred leader of the salt lake 
citybased apostolic united brethren one of the largest 
fundamentalist groups 
allreds followers and the 5000 residents of the adjoining 
towns of hildale utah and colorado city ariz prefer a communal 
setting apart from the modern world 
we know even according to christ himself that if youre 
friends with the world youre the enemy of god allred said 
now thats the main point to be in harmony with the world we 
dont believe in it and we suffer the consequences 
for cyril bradshaw 67 of colorado city polygamy has survived 
not only through faith but because men have done it very 
secretly 
men have taken plural wives and kept them in their homes 
and different places because its a requirement of the lord said 
bradshaw the father of 23 children 
at one time polygamists were hunted down and jailed for 
flouting laws against cohabitation utah authorities havent 
undertaken any such raids since the 1950s today they ignore the 
practice 
utah attorney general paul van dam said prosecution isnt worth 
it 
when you consider the difficulty of prosecution the social 
disruption and the constitutional considerations of freedom of 
religion it all adds to an allocation of resources that many of 
us feel would literally deplete our ability to prosecute more 
harmful crimes he said 
in fact most agree that violence by splinter groups have 
corroded the publics image of polygamy far more than the 
lifestyles of otherwise lawabiding believers 
indeed allred said the real threat to polygamy is the mormon 
church which he contends would cover us in dirt for refusing 
to adhere to modern interpretations of church doctrines

more than 10 years ago east germanys 
hardline communist government proposed building internment camps 
to lock up thousands of its opponents a newspaper said saturday 
the reported plan to stamp out the first signs of a grassroots 
opposition was never carried out and on oct 18 1989 a surging 
prodemocracy movement drove erich honecker and his communist 
regime from power 
since honeckers downfall there have been numerous accounts of 
how he tried to curb growing dissent some of those reports said 
honecker intended to lock up opponents last year as the pressure on 
his tottering regime mounted 
in the latest report the east german newspaper der morgen said 
honeckers aides started planning internment camps much earlier 
during the late 1970s as the fledgling opposition movement was 
just beginning 
the internment camps would have marked a major change for 
honecker who imprisoned hundreds of activists during his regime 
but never rounded up opponents en masse and shipped them to a gulag 
the subject of such camps is sensitive in a country still 
saddled with the murderous legacy of the nazi death camps and 
concentration camps 
der morgen said it had obtained extensive proof in the form of 
numerous secret papers that the oncedreaded secret police were 
behind the plot the ministry for state security had plans ready 
since the late 1970s for internment camps for opponents of the 
system and opposition figures the newspaper said 
der morgen is published by the liberal party once a puppet of 
the east german communist regime and now an independent party that 
plays only a negligible role in the countrys politics 
from the documents for the period from 1979 to 1989 it is 
clear to see with what precision and disrespect for human rights 
principles the internment was planned the daily newspaper said 
in its saturday editions 
the newspaper said one of the camps was planned for 1500 people 
near the town of gotha in the far southwestern part of the country 
der morgen ran two pictures of a cluster of a buildings targeted as 
the site 
another camp was planned for the southern city of erfurt in 
1984 according to der morgen it did not specify other sites but 
said that all together thousands of people were to be interned 
the camps were intended for members of the human rights peace 
and environmental movements for democratic socialists 
representatives of church groups and those wishing to leave the 
newspaper said 
by last year those categories included a sizeable portion of 
the entire population of 166 million people 
the nowdisbanded secret police the stasi had a massive 
network of spies and informers to single out anyone opposed to the 
hardline system 
opposition boiled over early in october during the visit of 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to east berlin 
at that time police beat protesters with clubs in a futile 
attempt to crush the prodemocracy movement 
less than two weeks later honecker and his hardline cronies 
had been ousted in a move that paved the way for democratic 
elections on march 18

after more than a quarter century with two 
wives don cox no longer sees polygamy as the only road to heaven 
he ahd his wives hope their children will have more sense than to 
share a spouse 
i dont feel like there are many advantages said earlene 
cox dons first wife if you had asked me seven years ago when 
i believed that my salvation depended on my living like this then 
my answer might have been different 
cox 57 is an electrical contractor who grows bedding plants to 
help support his wives and 19 children he thinks having more than 
one adult at home may be the only advantage to plural marriage 
like when we make trips to deliver plants there is always 
someone in the home he said 
but earlene the 54yearold mother of 11 of the cox children 
said the lifestyle is an unrelenting emotional struggle 
it gets plain complicated and its a challenge she said 
another wife comes in and wants to do it her way and its 
continual give and take 
don and earlene were married in 1953 in 1962 he took a second 
wife katy who is 50 the three have lived in colorado city for 22 
years 
while the mormon church abandoned polygamy in 1890 in exchange 
for utah statehood thousands of fundamentalists continue the 
practice believing it remains a commandment essential for a 
persons eternal welfare 
the coxes are one of a handful of families in the adjacent 
polygamist communities of hildale utah and colorado city ariz 
who have severed their their association with the fundamentalist 
church of jesus christ of latterday saints which is not part of 
the mormon church 
they are among 30 people who have sued in a federal court 
claiming the sect leaders who govern the towns 5000 inhabitants 
are illegally holding property belonging to church members 
earlene and katy who are often mistaken for sisters have shed 
the faiths traditional long skirts and hair in favor of blue jeans 
and shorter hairstyles 
we both decided its not how you look on the outside but what 
you are on the inside that matters earlene said 
the cox mothers are encouraging their two 17yearold daughters 
not to marry into polygamy several of their older children are 
married and thus far each has only one spouse 
its too hard of a lifestyle said earlene 
sometimes the three parents disagree about how to raise the 
children and don said that even though he tries to be impartial 
with his affection for his wives it sometimes seems impossible 
its hard when one person perceives something that really 
might not be happening don said life with two women is just 
plain complicated 
nevertheless the three have no plans to break up a relationship 
that has outlived its origins in religious belief 
oh yeah we will stick it out earlene said i mean we 
have raised these kids together

dearborn mich alex cameron props his feet up on the porch 
rail every day and says strange words like phrenicectomy to nobody 
in particular 
the linguistics professor from the university of dayton in ohio 
is preparing for his 10th year as the pronouncer at the may 3031 
scripps howard national spelling bee in washington 
theres a big push on a return to basics cameron said 
saturday at his sisters house in this detroit suburb where he is 
spending the month people are trying to call attention to those 
kinds of skills 
three researchers put together in november a list of 1000 words 
for the bee at which 220 students from across the united states 
will compete cameron using websters third new international 
dictionary researches definitions pronunciations roots and 
homonyms for the words 
phrenicectomy which means removal of a nerve in the diaphragm 
was a word in the bee a few years ago he said he said he didnt 
remember if anyone got it right 
cameron whipped out a few words he considered tricky to say and 
spell he said some contestants were stumped by the word acalculia 
which means the lack or loss of ability to perform simple or 
arithmetical tasks 
its a strange feeling to see these kids hanging around the 
lobby with their parents and theyre perfectly normal little 
kids cameron said you dont expect them to be able to stand 
in front of a bank of network news cameras and work their ways 
through words 
you see them pause and theyre just plain figuring it out up 
there he said 
memorizers rattle off words rather casually but later they 
disappear rather quickly cameron said thats the point at 
which people who have read a lot and have sense of the shape of 
words the basic roots make it 
he said few parents try to persuade him beforehand to go easy on 
their youngster 
cameron whos been at the university of dayton for 25 years 
said his start in pronouncing was a fluke he was looking over a 
word list made by a colleague richard baker who served as the 
national bees pronouncer for 29 years 
cameron spotted a word on the list that could be spelled two 
different ways baker drafted cameron to proofread and eventually 
turned the top job over to him when he retired 
cameron who has never competed in a spelling bee said every 
once in a while he stumbles over a word when pronouncing but is 
caught immediately by backup readers and judges who shout out 
now and then you have something carefully written out and you 
look right at it and say the wrong thing he said

here is a text of remarks saturday by secretary of 
state james a baker iii after talks with soviet leaders 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
we have just finished four days of long and detailed talks with 
president gorbachev foreign minister shevardnadze and their 
colleagues these have been some of the most intensive discussions 
we have had with our soviet counterparts during this 
administration in the end game of negotiations it is reasonable 
to expect both the intensity and difficulty of the work to 
increase in short we have been engaged in some heavy lifting to 
lock in agreements by the summit between president bush and 
president gorbachev 
i think our discussions have resulted in some real 
accomplishments and the progress we have made here makes me 
optimistic that we will have a productive summit in washington 
beginning less than two weeks from now 
in the five hours of meetings with president gorbachev we 
covered a number of issues including some arms control baltic 
and in particular lithuanian desires for independence german 
unification and the soviet economy we had a full exchange of 
views on these issues 
i might just say that in the discussions i had here on 
lithuania the parties expressed a desire to find a way to peaceful 
dialogue i cant say at this point that the soviets and 
lithuanians have yet arrived at a common basis on which to proceed 
i think they are now more actively seeking to develop that basis 
but they are not there yet 
let me briefly cover the results of our talks and where our 
relationship stands as we get ready for the summit 
on start the stragetic arms reduction talks our goal has been 
to reach agreement on the major substantive issues by the summit 
and we are now in a position to do so while some issues remain we 
have now reached agreement at this ministerial on what have been 
two of the most vexing problems we have faced in start 
airlaunched cruise missiles and sealaunched cruise missiles on 
alcms we have agreed to a complicated formula which equitably 
meets the needs of both sides 
on slcms we have agreed to a politically binding declaration 
which will stand outside of the start treaty itself the 
declaration will enhance both strategic stability and 
predictability without creating verification difficulties for 
either side 
we resolved a number of other start issues and also agreed to 
begin to work on the objectives for followon negotiations on start 
on chemical weapons we have reached agreement on a 
precedentsetting accord i believe that this agreement is very 
significant particularly as it provides a real pathway toward a 
global ban on horrific weapons that we already know from bitter 
experience actually get used 
very simply put this ussoviet accord is a trailblazing 
agreement that implements the presidents initiative on cw 
chemical weapons 
on nuclear testing we have completed work on the protocols to 
the nuclear testing treaties these are now ready for signing at 
the summit 
we also have agreed to a summit joint statement on nuclear 
chemical and missile nonproliferation 
the one area where we made less progress in arms control than we 
had hoped for is cfe conventional forces in europe we had come 
with ideas designed to push this process forward but our 
counterparts apparently werent able to respond meaningfully at 
this time 
on regional issues we had a full discussion on afghanistan i 
believe we are close to developing a common basis on which to move 
to free and fair elections the surest path to reconciliation 
peace and legitimacy in that wartorn country 
on central america our discussions reaffirmed the importance of 
continued adherence to the esquipulas treaty which established 
the central american peace plan and the need to end the insurgency 
in el salvador and promote a political dialogue 
on human rights and democratization we stressed our continuing 
concern over the remaining refusenik cases in the soviet union and 
the need to resolve all of them as soon as possible i also raised 
my concerns about antisemitism and the vital need for the soviet 
leadership to speak out strongly against it 
we had exchanges on economics transnational and bilateral 
issues we have finalized for signing at the summit several 
ussoviet agreements in the commercial area including the 
longterm grains agreement and the maritime transportation 
agreement 
in terms of transnational and bilateral issues we are ready to 
sign a maritime boundary agreement an agreement on oceans study 
an accord to open cultural and information centers in moscow and 
washington and perhaps others we also will be able to sign the 
thousandthousand agreement an exchange of a thousand 
undergraduate students between our countries 
in closing we have worked to prepare the ground so that our 
presidents can lock in and institutionalize mutual points of 
advantage in our relationship

builders complaining about a credit crunch 
are actually better off than they would be if regulators relaxed 
lending standards to keep money flowing a federal banking official 
said saturday 
sometimes economic growth and a safe and sound financial 
system appear to come into conflictin the short run comptroller 
of the currency robert l clarke told the national association of 
home builders 
but economic growth must rest on a safe and sound banking 
system in the long run he said in a speech prepared for delivery 
to the trade group 
earlier in the week the groups president martin perlman 
complained that a credit crunch was crippling the construction 
industry threatening 200000 jobs 
restrictions on savings and loans that congress built into the 
ninemonthold sampl bailout law combined with a crackdown on real 
estate lending by commercial bank regulators mean builders are 
being indiscriminately cut off from the credit markets perlman 
said 
clarke whose office regulates nationally chartered banks 
pointed out that banks have increased their mortgage lending from 
21 percent of the market in 1985 to 35 percent in 1989 
without tough regulation banks might not have been able to pick 
up the slack in mortgage lending when the sampl industry ran into 
trouble he said 
clarke added that regulators are not trying to prevent banks 
from making real estate loans but merely attempting to encourage 
caution in light of a cyclical downturn in real estate markets 
if a banker ever tells you that he cant make a loan because 
examiners wont let him be suspicious were not telling them 
to cut off credit from good customers he said

an asteroid many scientists believe ended the 
dinosaurs reign on earth 66 million years ago may have struck just 
off the western tip of cuba say two us researchers 
if they can overcome diplomatic hurdles caused by the us 
economic embargo bruce bohor of the us geological survey in 
denver and geophysicist russell seitz a former harvard visiting 
scholar want to go to the island to confirm their theory 
the very presence of cuba itself may be due to the asteroid 
bohor said in a telephone interview last week the curved tip of 
western cuban may be the crater rim and the isle of pines could be 
the central uplift or peak 
clues pointing to a caribbean landfall were assembled slowly in 
the decade since scientists first advanced the idea of a 
catastrophic end to the dinosaurs although the asteroid theory is 
not universally accepted some paleontologists blame climate 
changes or disease for the dinosaurs extinction it now has 
widespread support 
the theory requires an asteroid about 6 miles in diameter 
gouging out a crater up to 150 miles wide the resulting dust 
cloud or perhaps impactspawned fires volcanic activity climatic 
shifts and other factors could have killed the giant reptiles 
directly or choked off their food supply 
but there was a tough time accepting this because there was no 
crater to relate it to so we had to find a crater bohor said 
the possibility was that it hit in the ocean but that was hard 
to determine 
researchers however began to notice what is in effect a 
geological directional arrow pointing to somewhere near north 
america 
a study by arizona researchers alan holdebrand and william 
boynton published in fridays science magazine agrees about the 
general area of the strike somewhere in the caribbean they 
believe the asteroid fell more to the south of what is now cuba 
however closer to colombia 
bohor and seitz who explained their theory in the april 12 
edition of nature say without a close inspection of the cuban 
site no one can be sure and they say all geologists are basing 
their findings on the same data 
all around the world a layer of irridium an element found in 
asteroids has been found at about the 66millionyear level in 
geological formations also found at the same level are shocked 
mineral grains microscopic quartz crystals apparently blown out 
of the earths crust by a massive impact and carried around the 
world by winds 
but something interesting happens to those crystals in north 
america says seitz 
from colorado south the crystals get bigger so big they could 
not have been blown there but would had to have been ejected 
directly by the force of impact 
then a team examining what was thought to be a volcanic site in 
haiti just east of cuba made an intriguing find similar 
crystals that appeared to come from an asteroid impact but the 
crystals were 10 times bigger than any previously found and were in 
a layer 25 times thicker 
it set off a bell that we were getting closer to the crater 
bohor says 
bohor and seitz then began poring over geological data from the 
caribbean and came upon old references to beds of large exotic 
boulders in cuba 
scientific studies in cuba since fidel castro took power in 1959 
have been conducted primarily by eastern bloc experts in 1986 
polish geologist andrej pszczolkowski published a study of 
halfmile sized boulders found on the sea floor off the cuban 
coast from the patterns of the rocks he determined they must have 
been hurled there rather than simply pushed by slow geological 
movement as earlier researchers theorized 
if the asteroid did strike near cuba even larger rocks must lie 
either on the island or just offshore rocks as large as 3 miles 
wide they believe 
as geologists bohor and seitz take no position on whether an 
asteroid killed off the dinosaurs or even if this impact might be 
a candidate their goal they say is simply to determine if there 
is an impact just south of cubas western tip 66 million years ago 
knowing where the asteroid hit could help solve questions about 
nuclear winter acid rain previously unexplained evolutionary 
patterns and other scientific controversies 
of most immediate concern it could give insight into confusing 
geological plate movements in the caribbean they note examining 
the crater could perhaps help determine when and where to expect 
earthquakes

christians from around the 
world gathered saturday for a new version of the centuriesold 
passion play about the suffering of jesus rewritten to cut out 
antisemitic passages and images 
until now the play depicted jewish high priests with horns and 
obscured jesus identity as a jew in the new version jesus and 
the apostles wear traditional prayer shawls and jesus is 
frequently addressed as rabbi 
when we christians put on an affair involving jews after all 
jesus was a jew and nearly all of the characters were jewish we 
have to do it with a great deal of caution and respect said the 
plays 28yearold head director christian stueckl 
but a main question at saturdays performance a final dress 
rehearsal before the premiere on sunday was whether the changes 
went far enough 
controversy focused on a passage in which jews upon the 
condemnation of jesus cry out his blood be on us and on our 
children 
the words used for centuries are seen by many as burdening the 
jews with collective guilt for christs death 
why must this sentence which has plagued jews for so many 
generations remain in the play jewish theologian pinchas 
lapide an austrian who worked as an adviser to the plays 
directors asked at a news conference 
stueckl said he had wanted to remove the line but could not win 
permission from the village committee presiding over the play 
a fivepage epilogue to the play text defends the line saying 
it is not antisemitic 
the words about blood guilt are not meant to be antisemitic 
or antijewish wrote rudolf pesch an adviser to the text 
committee he said the words were formulated in the jewish 
biblical tradition 
jesus was a jew antisemitism of any kind is also directed 
against him pesch added in the epilogue 
the oberammergau passion play dates back to 1633 when bubonic 
plague was raging roman catholic villagers vowed to stage a 
passion play every 10 years if the plague abated and it did it 
was considered a miracle 
now christians converge on the bavarian alpine village of 5000 
every 10 years for the staging of the play the last performance a 
special jublilee presentation in 1984 attracted 470000 visitors 
about half of them americans 
nearly half a million visitors are also expected this year 
there will be 95 performances of the daylong production which runs 
until sept 30 
some got a preview on saturday by viewing the dress rehearsal 
the quality of the production the acting and the music is 
just excellent said maj barry cole 39 a us army pilot from 
chattanooga tenn who is stationed in west germany 
ive never seen such a wonderful setting said his wife 
rebecca 
while the audience sits inside the theater the stage extends 
beyond the roof under the open sky the bavarian alps are the 
backdrop and birds fly overhead 
meanwhile play officials said prosecutors were investigating a 
possible case of fraud that left thousands of wouldbe playgoers 
disappointed 
village officials said at a news conference that two british 
travel agencies had paid a local hotel about 125 million for 
20000 tickets that the hotel then failed to deliver as promised 
the committee said the hotel was not authorized to sell tickets 
which travel agencies can obtain only from the official 
oberammergau community tourist office the play has been sold out 
for months 
the committee said prosecutors were investigating the hotel for 
possible fraud the agencies asked that extra performances of the 
play be held for their disappointed customers but the committee 
turned them down

last year the companys revenues fell to 606 million from 756 
million in 1988 largely because of divested assets operating 
profits of 65 million were down 34 percent from 98 million a year 
earlier 
stewart bryan acknowledged the industry has been in the doldrums 
but said earnings would be robust this year he would not give 
an estimate 
evans said another year or two of lean financial results was 
possible but the companys longterm future looked bright 
it may be that stewart bryan is taking over at the beginning 
of an era of renewed growth for the company said joseph l 
antrim iii a media stock analyst at davenport amp co in richmond 
clearly thats what they think is in store for them 
the younger bryan said no major acquisitions are envisioned in 
the near term

former communist dictator nicolae 
ceausescu and his wife elena had lavish burial plans but a 
government official said saturday they were buried under false 
names in a public cemetery 
the ranking official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
confirmed rumors that the ceausescus who were toppled in the 
december revolution were buried at the ghencea cemetery in south 
bucharest 
he is on the left and she is on the right side of the path 
leading to the cemeterys chapel the official said 
gravediggers took a group of western reporters to the burial 
site and pointed out two plots overgrown with weeds candles burned 
on other nearby graves but the two in question were unattended 
the violent revolution that toppled the ceausescus and ended 
more than 40 years of repressive communist rule climaxed on 
christmas day when the two were executed 
ceausescu and his wife a former politburo member and first 
deputy premier had been tried in secret in a military barracks in 
tirgoviste a city 43 miles west of bucharest 
a recent film of the ceausescus execution and burial was shown 
on romanian tv but it did not disclose the site the videotape 
also did not show ceausescu tearfully going to his death in front 
of a firing squad and mrs ceausescu screaming in panic at his side 
authorities fearing that vengeful romanians would desecrate the 
graves have refused to say where the two were buried 
this is a state secret we cannot let the cat out of the bag 
people might find out and they will scrub the graves to know 
the truth said vasile ionescu a 68year old carpenter who has 
worked at the graveyard for 15 years 
however gravediggers showed reporters the unkempt plots assumed 
to hold the ceausescus bodies they refused to identify 
themselves saying they would be severely punished if the 
authorities learned their names 
the gravediggers pointed out the unusual way in which the graves 
had been dug breaking with the regular pattern and resembling 
hastily added plots 
the government official refused to disclose the names under 
which the ceausescus were buried 
ceausescus presumed grave is topped by a common oak cross whose 
inscription reads col popa dan 19201989 mrs ceausescus has 
an identical wooden cross carrying the name col enescu vasile 
19211989 
according to official statistics ceausescu was born in l9l8 and 
elena in l9l6 
cemetery administrators would not confirm the burial site and 
insisted that the ceausescus graves should remain secret 
they could be buried in tirgoviste or some other place but 
not here an undertaker said 
the dictator and his wife had carefully planned for their 
burials by ordering expensive goldplated coffins media reports 
have said 
the dictators deserved their fate said a beggar pointing to 
the cheap desolate graves

secretary of state james a baker iii on saturday 
concluded a trailblazing agreement with the soviet union to 
destroy chemical weapons and settled longsmoldering disputes over 
limits on nucleartipped cruise missiles 
we have engaged in some heavy lifting baker said after four 
days of marathon talks that set the stage for this months meeting 
between president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
the progress we have made here makes me optimistic that we will 
have a productive summit in washington 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said the moscow 
meetings gave him confidence now that the treaty on strategic 
arms can be prepared for signature before the end of this year 
at the same time a tiredlooking baker said before flying home 
that the two sides had made less progress than he hoped toward a 
treaty to reduce troops tanks and other nonnuclear arms in europe 
bush speaking with reporters in texas gave the talks a mixed 
review he said it would take some give by the soviets for 
the summit to be a success 
the agreement on chemical weapons to be signed during the may 
30june 3 summit is designed to show the way for some 40 nations 
negotiating a global ban on chemical weapons production in geneva 
very simply put this ussoviet accord is a trailblazing 
agreement baker said 
baker said bush and gorbachev also will sign an agreement on 
verifying limits on underground nuclear test explosions conducted 
under 1974 and 1976 ussoviet treaties the protocols call for 
onsite inspection 
baker said the two sides were closer to a plan for elections in 
afghanistan which the soviet union invaded in 1979 
the agreement on air and sealaunched cruise missiles removes a 
major obstacle to a declaration to cut us and soviet longrange 
nuclear weapons by bush and gorbachev at their summit 
we are now in a position to do so baker said although he 
said some issues remained to be settled they will be tackled by 
us and soviet negotiators beginning sunday in geneva and the 
strategic arms reduction treaty start might be completed by the 
end of the year 
a summit declaration would point the way to an overall reduction 
of 30 percent to 35 percent in us and soviet longrange bombers 
missiles and submarines 
turning to lithuania baker said the soviets and the leaders of 
the breakaway baltic republic were working harder to find a way to 
settle their dispute peacefully but they are not there yet 
baker was euphoric in announcing the chemical weapons pact 
we have reached agreement on a precedentsetting accord he 
said i believe that this agreement is very significant 
particularly as it provides a real pathway toward a global ban on 
horrific weapons that we already know from bitter experience 
actually get used 
under the agreement to be signed at the summit the two sides 
would immediately cease production of chemical weapons and destroy 
80 percent of their stocks 
by the eighth year both sides would have reduced their supplies 
further to 2 percent of the current level and two years after that 
they hope to destroy the rest if all other countries capable of 
producing chemical weapons join them in a global ban us 
officials said 
the nuclear test accords have never been ratified by the senate 
and former president ronald reagan reported to congress the soviets 
may have exceeded the ceiling of 150 kilotons 
shevardnadze and baker said the us and soviet presidents also 
will issue a joint statement against the spread of nuclear and 
chemical arms 
baker noted less progress than he hoped to complete a treaty on 
conventional forces in europe we had come with ideas designed to 
push this process forward but our counterparts apparently werent 
able to respond meaningfully at this time he said 
on afghanistan he said the united states and the soviet union 
were closer to developing a plan for free and fair elections 
the surest path to reconciliation peace and legitimacy in that 
wartorn country 
although baker did not go into details us and soviet 
officials have been mapping out a plan that would permit the 
sovietbacked government in kabul to try to retain a share of power 
in a transitional government but president najibullah and many of 
his key supporters would have to step down 
on human rights baker said he had registered his concern about 
antisemitism and the vital need for the soviet leadership to 
speak out strongly against it 
he said he was concerned as well over the refusal of 
authorities to grant exit permits to jews on the ground they knew 
state secrets according to us officials 12 of the 20 
refuseniks bush urged gorbachev at the malta summit last 
december to let go have not been given permits 
shevardnadze said he had asked baker to raise the us quota to 
allow more soviet jews to emigrate to the united states rather than 
israel in order to reduce tensions in the middle east he said no 
specific number was mentioned 
on strategic nuclear arms baker said the two sides reached 
agreement on two of the most vexing problems we have faced 
airlaunched cruise missiles and sealaunched cruise missiles 
missiles carried on fighter planes would be curbed under a 
complicated formula which equitably meets the needs of both 
sides he said 
as for sealaunched cruise missiles baker said the superpowers 
agreed to a declaration outside start 
the declaration will enhance both strategic stability and 
predictability without creating verifications difficulties for 
either side baker said 
shevardnadze said the agreement on cruise missiles was not 
easy to achieve and that talks almost broke off at some points 
explaining the agreement on airlaunched cruise missiles baker 
said the soviets achieved their goal on the range of the elusive 
missiles while the united states won out on how nuclear missiles 
would be distinguished from conventional cruises and on the 
numerical ceiling 
on sealaunched cruise missiles which the united states 
successfully sought to exclude from the pact baker said there 
would be limit of 880 of the nucleartipped version but there would 
be no system of going aboard ships or otherwise verifying how many

wild at heart david lynchs latest 
dark and surreal portrait of contemporary america was well 
received at the cannes film festival on saturday despite its heavy 
dose of violence and explicit sex 
lynchs film was the last of three american movies shown in 
competition for the golden palm award given the warm applause it 
received from critics and journalists at special press viewings it 
looked like a wellplaced contender 
like lynchs earlier films eraserhead and blue velvet 
and his current tv series twin peaks wild at heart 
follows a cast of peculiar and quixotic characters through a plot 
drawn from the world of soap operas 
the cannes program described lynch as an eagle scout from 
missoula montana but the director told a news conference the 
film would have been even more violent if he had portrayed the 
fantasies he had as a scout 
the story line base on a novel by barry gifford describes a 
love affair between sailor ripley portrayed by nicolas cage who 
commits manslaughter in selfdefense and lula pace fortune played 
by laura dern 
lulas alcoholic nymphomaniac mother played by derns 
reallife mother diane ladd tries in vain to get rid of the 
hapless sailor 
the film becomes a chase as the young couple are pursued through 
the deep south and texas all the way to a seedy burg called big 
tuna by various characters who are engaged to waylay and kill 
sailor 
the people the couple encounter along the way include a hoodlum 
named bobby peru portrayed by willem dafoe and his exotic 
girlfriend played by isabella rosselini wearing a blond wig and 
bushy eyebrows 
the cagedern couple have explicit love scenes throughout 
the audience also witnesses plenty of gore in one scene sailor 
batters a knifewielding aggressor in another cage and dern watch 
a girl bleed to death after a car accident and in a third a 
passing cop kills peru 
its all done with a straight face but as in his other works 
the impression is that lynch is often laughing up his sleeve 
fire becomes a central image in wild at heart including 
flashbacks showing the violent death by fire of lulus father 
cigarettes are lit so often that one critic remarked you 
might have a hard time getting the film shown on planes in the 
states 
it might set off smoke alarms lynch agreed 
lynch said he was worried the american motion picture 
association may force him to cut some of the most violent and 
sexually explicit scenes for american audiences 
he said he gave test showings and in the first 100 people 
walked out in the second 120 left 
but i cut one little thing he added without saying what 
and nobody walked out of the third showing 
in all 19 films from a dozen countries are competing for the 
golden palm the two other american entries are clint eastwoods 
white hunter black heart and alan parkers come see the 
paradise 
the film festival ends monday following a showing of the 
comfort of strangers an american film directed by paul schrader 
that is being shown out of competition the golden palm winner is 
announced monday evening

rival shiite moslem militia factions 
allied with syria and iran fought street battles in crowded west 
beirut saturday as a ceasefire appeared to be holding in the 
christian enclave 
police said one person was killed and 17 others were wounded in 
the sudden outbreak of violence between the proiranian hezbollah 
or party of god and the syrianbacked amal militia 
the fighting engulfed west beiruts densely populated 
neighborhoods of bourj abuhaidar musaitbeh and nuwairi where the 
iranian embassy is located 
when the battles erupted at 4 pm panicky motorists abandoned 
their cars to take cover in nearby buildings 
hundreds of families huddled in basements and bomb shelters as 
the two sides blasted each others positions with mortars and 
rocketpropelled grenades 
voice of the nation a moslemrun radio station based in bourj 
abuhaidar interrupted programming to report that a school in the 
district was burning it appealed to civil defense officials to 
dispatch fire engines to the scene 
police said syrian troops in charge of west beiruts security 
deployed troops and tanks in the embattled district three hours 
later and enforced a ceasefire 
it was unclear what touched off the battles but a hezbollah 
statement accused amal militiamen of firing rocketpropelled 
grenades at hezbollah militiamen 
amal and hezbollah have been locked in a struggle since may 1987 
for control over lebanons 12 million shiites who make up the 
largest single sect in the country 
at least 1041 people have been killed and 3076 wounded in 
intermittent amalhezbollah clashes in beirut and south lebanon in 
the past three years 
in beiruts christian enclave police reported occasional 
outbursts of sniper fire between rebel gen michel aouns troops 
and lebanese forces militiamen of his rival christian warlord 
samir geagea 
but they reported no serious confrontations or casualties 
despite the lull in the christian enclave security sources said 
truckloads of ammunition sent by prosyrian factions were rolling 
down the central mountains into aouns beleaguered metn province 
the ammunition was mainly for his sovietdesigned 130mm howitzer 
batteries the sources said speaking on condition of anonymity 
one source explained that syria is not dealing directly with 
aoun but that its surrogates were transporting the ammunition to 
the army officer who last year fought the syrians for six months in 
what he called a war of liberation 
the prosyrian groups involved in the operation the source 
said were factions that have had a longstanding blood feud with 
geagea 
the source said aoun was paying cash for the ammunition adding 
that the moves served syrias goal of stripping him of funds he 
received from iraq and the palestine liberation organization iraqi 
president saddam hussein and plo chairman yasser arafat are syrian 
president hafez assads main arab foes 
saddam and arafat had backed both aoun and geagea in last years 
war against syrias 40000 troops in lebanon the two have tried to 
bring the 3monthold interchristian confrontation to a halt in an 
effort to rescue the antisyria camp in lebanon 
the inconclusive showdown between aoun and geagea has killed 
1031 people and wounded 2769 since jan 30

barbara bush who left college before 
graduating to marry george bush was given an honorary doctor of 
humanities degree saturday and praised as a role model for wives 
and mothers across the land 
mrs bush urged graduates of st louis university to set sail 
and take risks as they leave school reminding them that no 
decisions they make early in life are irrevocable 
you need not have a game plan for life she told them 
george bush certainly didnt i know i was there 
mrs bush also made an indirect peace offering to feminists at 
wellesley college 
somewhere in this audience today may be a future president of 
the united states mrs bush told the 1488 graduates of the 
roman catholic school and i wish her well 
last months announcement that she would give the commencement 
address at the massachusetts womens college june 1 drew protests 
about 150 of wellesleys 2200 students signed a petition saying 
mrs bush gained recognition through her husbands 
achievements not her own which contradicts what we have been 
taught over our years at wellesley 
the president of st louis university the rev lawrence biondi 
said however that mrs bush had accomplished much on her own 
her charm and wit have endeared her to the great and humble 
alike biondi said and by forthrightly choosing to be herself 
she has become the peoples choice as a role model for wives and 
mothers across the land and as a staunch supporter of 
voluntarism she is thus a most worthy candidate for recognition 
today 
the wellesley controversy eased friday when it was announced 
that mrs bush would share the podium with soviet first lady raisa 
gorbachev who has a doctoral degree from a soviet university

in a turnabout officials of the 
government and the contra rebels on saturday denied that the rebels 
had stopped laying down their arms 
a day earlier the chief contra military commander israel 
galeano had said the disarmament process was suspended citing 
what he said were broken promises to the rebels and what he called 
social instability 
the rebel disarmament is one of the key elements of the 
transition from president daniel ortegas sandinista government to 
that of violeta barrios de chamorro who was inaugurated april 25 
the contras had agreed to disarm by june 10 but the process has 
been going slowly with only 1000 of about 11000 fighters putting 
down their weapons by thursday 
roberto ferrey a former contra leader who now is the government 
coordinator for the disarmament denied that the process had 
stopped 
at no time has the demobilization and disarmament process been 
suspended he said saturday 
in miami contra spokesman alejandro acevedo said galeanos 
statements had been deauthorized by the contras general staff 
the conflicting statements could not be immediately reconciled 
galeano released his statement from the remote community of el 
almendra in one of several zones designated to safeguard security 
while the rebels disarm the zones are policed by the united 
nations 
asked if contra commanders would release a second statement 
rescinding the one from galeano on friday ferrey answered that 
depends on the decision of the general staff of the resistance 
ferrey who visited the el almendra area on friday said he 
explained the situation to the rebel leaders and added that the 
wishes of the government and of violeta barrios de chamorro remain 
firm 
the process must continue the idea is to keep the 
demobilization and disarmament process moving forward until it 
arrives at its culmination he said 
many contras want top sandinistas removed from high military 
positions and say they want the size of nicaraguas army the 
regions largest pared down 
although the sandinistas lost the elections they still wield 
considerable power a paralyzing sandinistaled strike by public 
employees last week resulted in the strikers winning almost 
everything they had demanded 
galeano said in his communique that demobilized contras were not 
getting sufficient food or care that sandinista troops had not 
completely abandoned the security zones and that sandinista 
sympathizers have not been disarmed 
ferrey said he spoke with five contra commanders who are part of 
the general staff and they assured him that the disarmament 
process is continuing sergio ramirez vice president under the 
sandinistas called the communique from galeano an extremely 
grave move against the peace and stability of nicaragua 
a communique delivered saturday to the associated press 
purportedly from a clandestine group called urban commandos of the 
internal resistance expressed support for the deal between the 
government and the contras but demanded the dismantling of 
nicaraguan military units near the security zones 
it contended the army made up almost entirely of sandinista 
supporters plans to infiltrate the security zones starting june 
11 the day after the rebel disarmament is to be completed

every spring when the corn started 
sprouting and the tiny yellowandwhite chamomile flowers began 
winking along the narrow roads the dark shadow of nicolae 
ceausescu fell over this village 
that was when the line of blue and black official cars would 
begin to arrive bringing the communist leader on frequent visits 
to his holiday residence about 20 miles north of bucharest 
this year everything is different 
for the first spring in decades there is no ceausescu in 
snagov no army or secret police and on sunday residents once 
imprisoned by fear will vote in the first free national elections 
in more than 50 years 
theres a new atmosphere said dumitru grigore a retired 
supply clerk at the ceausescu vacation compound people are 
living better 
like many other villages in romania snagov suffered under 
ceausescu who was overthrown and executed in a popular revolution 
last december 
traditional homes were torn down and replaced by concrete 
apartment buildings in a forced urbanization program inefficient 
collectivized agriculture caused food shortages 
in addition snagov had the burden of playing host to the 
capricious ceausescu 
local residents say peasants had to kill their roosters every 
spring so they would not wake him roads were blocked the church 
bell was silenced and residents were sometimes ordered to work on 
sundays because ceausescu liked to see them looking busy 
we were not allowed to have a pig because they stink said 
gheorge trandafir 79 who farms a small plot across the street 
from the walledin ceausescu compound 
a new era has begun in this village of 3000 people reflecting 
nationwide changes wrought by the interim government led by ion 
iliescu 
the hated urbanization program has been halted and the 
transitional government has granted peasants the right to own about 
5000 square yards of land up from 200 square yards under 
ceausescu 
from the moment iliescu came to power we have had food and 
wood for the fire said trandafirs wife anica 75 wrapped in a 
faded dress her gray hair peeking from a brownandyellow 
polkadot scarf behind her corn sprouted and grape vines dangled 
from wires 
ceausescu was not for his people he was for himself she 
declared 
who would she vote for on sunday for the one who gives me 
bread she smiled 
she shrugged off opposition charges that iliescu the 
presidential candidate of the national salvation front was an 
unreformed communist 
everyone had to be a communist if he wanted to do well she 
said 
grigore expressed similar enthusiasm for iliescu and the front 
a loose grouping of former communist officials and intellectuals 
who took power during the revolution 
my opinion is that everyone is content about iliescu we had a 
hard life under ceausescu he said 
he gestured to a series of modernistic bonewhite apartment 
buildings that people were being forced to inhabit the style 
contrasted sharply with the traditional brick or stucco village 
homes trimmed with curly wrought iron and surrounded by gardens 
if ceausescu hadnt died no houses would have remained 
here grigore said he had to die for the village to survive 
about 400 of the 1600 homes in the village were demolished 
under the urbanization program local officials said 
now on the edges of snagov new homes and barns are going up 
ceausescus vacation compound is still off limits guarded by 
soldiers but mayor nicolae marian marinescu says the national 
government is planning to convert the series of lakeside villas 
into residences for visiting western business executives 
the mayor said villagers were excited about voting but that 
some vestige of ceausescu remained 
they feel more liberated he said but after 45 years of 
fear they have fear in their souls

defense secretary dick cheney joins nato 
defense ministers in brussels this week to evaluate the diminished 
soviet threat and chart the future of the western military alliance 
the meeting follows ussoviet agreement announced saturday in 
moscow on cooperation to ban production of chemical weapons and 
resolution of major disputes on cutting longrange nuclear arms 
the defense ministers of the north atlantic treaty 
organizations member nations will focus on natos plans for its 
armies and nonnuclear weaponry and to hear an updated report on 
the threat posed by soviet forces 
cheney in a speech friday in washington termed the warsaw pact 
a fiction a military unit that no longer constitutes a 
significant military threat to western europe 
the threat may not have disappeared totally but it certainly 
would appear to be headed in that direction cheney said in a 
speech to an executive exchange group at the state department 
at the brussels meeting tuesday and wednesday the ministers 
must assess the need for their own armed forces once an eastwest 
accord is completed on slashing the number of tanks artillery and 
other socalled conventional weapons 
although the pace of the talks in vienna has slowed an 
agreement is expected to be reached later this year in an attempt 
to erase a major sticking point the administration has put forward 
new proposals that could allow a compromise on the number of combat 
aircraft allowed by either side 
the brussels talks come only two weeks after ministers met in 
canada where they agreed to make more cuts in their arsenal of 
shortrange nuclear missiles the sessions have been scheduled as a 
series of consultations in preparation for the summit of nato 
government leaders in london in july 
this weeks session will show that much useful work has been 
done at nato and in its capitals to plan ahead for the environment 
we anticipate by the mid1990s said a senior pentagon official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
at the session the ministers are expected to formally scrap the 
longstanding but rarely honored budget target of a 3 percent 
annual growth in their defense budgets 
as well the united states and the nato allies have tentatively 
agreed on a plan for sharing the cuts in tanks artillery and other 
weapons that are expected to be reached in the conventional arms 
accord later this year 
alliance sources who spoke on condition of anonymity have 
indicated the united states will get the largest share of the cuts 
unchanged for nato the pentagon official said will be a 
militarily significant us force presence in europe and the 
presence of us nuclear weapos on the continent as a deterrence to 
nuclear war 
in the coming months the alliance faces two crucial tasks the 
official said 
these include identifying the aspects of nato which can and 
should be revised and developing a plan for much broader 
changes that will take into account the implementation of the 
conventional arms accord the withdrawal of soviet troops from 
eastern europe and the emergence of pluralistic systems in those 
nations

a colombian reputed to be an important 
figure in the medellin cocaine cartel was convicted saturday on two 
federal drug conspiracy counts 
jose abello silva faces up to 8 million in fines and 30 years 
in prison us district judge thomas brett set sentencing for may 
29 
jurors convicted abello 35 of conspiring to import marijuana 
and cocaine into the united states and conspiring to possess drugs 
with intent to distribute 
his attorneys said they would appeal 
abello met with his attorneys after the verdicts and sobbed 
said defense attorney richard haynes 
its a normal human reaction haynes said hes 
devastated hes hurt hes terribly disappointed he cried i 
cried 
the jury deliberated a little more than 20 hours over three days 
before issuing its verdicts jurors identities remained secret 
throughout for security reasons 
prosecutors called 23 witnesses during five weeks of testimony 
many were convicted drug smugglers who identified abello in the 
courtroom and said he supervised drug shipments from colombian 
airstrips through the bahamas 
abello testified that he was an honest rancher who sold imported 
cars and fought bulls on the side he said he was a friend of the 
ochoa family alleged to be part of the leadership of the medellin 
drug cartel but said his visits were limited to dealings with 
cattle 
haynes and cocounsel patrick williams said prosecutors secrecy 
about witnesses hurt their case and haynes criticized pretrial 
publicity 
well appeal we think there are some errors in the case 
williams said this has been couched in secrecy we were totally 
denied access to previous statements witnesses made 
williams said many of the witnesses were confessed drug 
smugglers and suggested they had lied about abello to shorten their 
own prison sentences 
snitches behind bars can come up with stories that will fool 
good investigators that will fool good prosecutors and that are 
totally untrue williams said 
abello of santa marta colombia was indicted in tulsa in 1987 
he was extradited oct 29 from bogota to tulsa 
colombias administrative security department said he had been 
arrested in a bogota restaurant and that he had undergone facial 
surgery to avoid easy detection 
it also said abello was the fourthranking person in the 
medellin cocaine cartel 
the administrative security department said abello was the 
cartels chief of operations for colombias northern coast where 
dozens of clandestine air strips are used to smuggle 300 to 400 
tons of cocaine into the united states each year that region also 
has ports where cocaine is stashed aboard rusty freighters working 
the coast of central america and mexico 
abello was not on the us justice departments list of 12 most 
wanted traffickers but the department has said it wanted dozens of 
other colombians on federal drug charges 
of 15 colombians extradited to the united states since last 
august abello is the first whose case has reached a verdict 
the case against abello started in 1986 when oklahoma 
authorities arrested a drug courier en route to denver he agreed 
to cooperate under a plea agreement and helped police hook boris 
olarte morales 
olarte also agreed to cooperate and began making telephone calls 
to fellow smugglers the calls resulted in a february 1987 meeting 
in aruba off venezuelas coast between abello and several others 
prosecutors contended abello agreed to import 500 kilograms of 
cocaine more than half a ton into the united states part of 
the proceeds allegedly would have gone to help free olarte the 
plan was never enacted 
abello testified that he attended the meeting in aruba but said 
he stormed out of the room when the conversation turned to drugs

first lady barbara bush says she suffered a 
severe case of depression after returning from china in 1976 but 
overcame it after throwing herself into volunteer work 
i would feel like crying a lot and i really painfully hurt

world report 
mrs bush the subject of the magazines cover story recalled 
how depression overtook her when she and husband george returned 
to the united states after two years in china

had been together much of the time but that changed drastically 
when bush returned to become director of the cia 
she said depression preyed on her mind and i would think bad 
thoughts i will tell you it was not nice 
her remedy was to volunteer for service work in the washington 
home a healthcare center for the seriously ill in that role she 
performed chores ranging from changing bedclothes to washing the 
hair of patients

to janet tulloch a resident of the home who has cerebral palsy

that she dislikes braggadocio which she considers 
selfaggrandizing and a bit tawdry 
it was not the first time the first lady turned to volunteer 
work in time of stress the magazine said she threw herself into a 
volunteer project in 1953 following the loss of her 3yearold 
daughter robin to leukemia while the family was living in midland 
texas 
the pain was so extraordinary she said 
for a while after robin died i played with my children all of 
the time she said i one day heard little george out the 
window saying to his friend i cant play with you today i have 
to play with my mother and thats when i threw myself into the 
league project 
calling on wealthy friends for contributions and spreading the 
news among the poor she worked with a forerunner of the junior 
league to establish a thrift shop to help clothe the needy 
the future first lady also worked at midland memorial hospital 
giving baths to patients and rubbing their backs 
in the interview mrs bush also reiterated that she had no 
quarrel with students at wellesley college who have protested her 
selection as commencement speaker 
the students complained she was invited not because of her 
independent accomplishments but because she is the presidents wife 
im not going to scold im not going to cajole im not going 
to apologize im not going to explain said mrs bush raisa 
gorbachev the wife of the soviet president will join mrs bush at 
the commencement 
the poor girls theyre so bored with it now they could throw 
up she said she said she has received letters from wellesley 
graduates saying they are so upset about the protest that they will 
no longer contribute funds to the elite new england womens college

processing lab and they blamed drug traffickers for killing three 
police officers in medellin 
police said fridays raid by a special antinarcotics police 
unit near the town of puerto triunfo 75 miles north of bogota 
yielded more than 3000 pounds of cocaine 
authorities also seized processing equipment and about 25000 
gallons of ether acetone and other chemicals used to make cocaine

a syrian government official saturday 
accused british prime minister margaret thatcher of lacking 
interest in gaining the release of british hostages held in lebanon 
information minister mohammad salman used the issue to criticize 
the british government for making it difficult for syrian 
journalists to enter britain and he said syria would retaliate 
in spite of the efforts displayed continuously by syria to 
secure the release of the western hostages in lebanon it seems 
that the government of mrs thatcher is not interested in the fate 
of british hostages since it has not established any dialogue or 
contact with the concerned syrian authorities salman said 
britain broke relations with syria in 1986 after its 
intelligence services were linked to an effort to plant a bomb 
aboard a londontel aviv flight 
still salman said syria has always smoothed the way for the 
entry of british journalists they have been allowed to obtain 
visas at damascus airport or other border posts two to three days 
after notifying the information ministry he said 
britain however has forced syrian journalists to travel twice 
to embassies in either amman or nicosia to apply for and pick up 
visas a process that often takes between four and six weeks and is 
very costly in syrian standards salman said 
from now on british journalists will have to apply for visas at 
embassies abroad and wait for an answer he told a visiting united 
nations factfinding team 
the syrians have been instrumental in negotiating hostage 
releases two american captives were released in april through 
damascus 
the remaining 16 hostages include six americans four britons 
two west germans two swiss and italian and an irishman terry 
anderson 42 chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press is the longestheld hostage he was kidnapped on march 16 
1985 
the weekly magazine alshiraa in beirut lebanon reported 
saturday that us hostage thomas sutherland was ill and would be 
the next american released 
sutherland 59 former dean of agriculture at the american 
university of beirut was kidnapped on june 9 1985 the magazine 
did not describe his health problems 
in a brief report attributed to a knowledgeable source 
alshiraa also said that an irish envoy was in beirut seeking the 
release of the irish hostage brian keenan and that contacts were 
under way on behalf of the britons it did not name the irish envoy 
alshiraa gained international fame in november 1986 when it 
was first to report on the secret us arms shipments to iran in 
return for the release of hostages but its reporting on hostages 
since then including several predictions about their release has 
been wrong

the ussoviet chemical weapons accord 
announced saturday brings to fruition a proposal president bush 
made to the united nations last fall six years after he used his 
vice presidential power to save a 130 million nervegas program 
bush exercising his constitutional authority as presiding 
officer of the senate voted july 13 1983 to break a 4949 tie 
thus defeating an attempt to stop the pentagon from modernizing 
these lethal weapons 
but the following year bush carried a draft chemical weapons 
treaty text to multilateral negotiations in geneva on a global 
accord he proposed at the time that nations signing such a pact 
stop producing the arms right away and destroy their stockpiles 
over a 10yearperiod 
with the geneva negotiations still dragging on bush eight 
months after being sworn in as president brought his proposal to 
the united nations in the sept 24 address he said the united 
states would agree to a chemical weapons phaseout 
it was an attempt to spur a separate effort by washington and 
moscow to find agreement on a bilateral chemical weapons ban 
the geneva talks continue but bush didnt want to wait so the 
accord hailed by secretary of state james a baker iii on saturday 
as a trailblazing agreement gives the superpowers a concrete 
achievement to highlight at the may 30june 3 summit that bush will 
host for soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
an era of generally declining ussoviet tensions and the 
political risks of lost opportunities conspired to lead bush 
inexorably along the path that led to the moscow breakthrough over 
the weekend and hes come under increasing pressure from congress 
as well 
the administration in fact served notice last week that it 
opposed the senate version of legislation which would require the 
president to impose sanctions against nations that use chemical or 
biological weapons in violation of international law 
the state department said the senate bill with its mandatory 
sanctions would limit bushs constitutional authority to conduct 
foreign policy 
bushs record on chemical weapons has been checkered over the 
years while he long has considered these weapons a world menace 
he also has believed the united states could not engage in a 
wholesale destruction of its arsenal while countries retained 
theirs 
he was sharply criticized by senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine for failing to mention in the un speech that 
he had decided to make a new generation of chemical weapons even 
while publicly pursuing an international ban 
but ronald lehman head of the arms control and disarmament 
agency jumped to bushs defense saying it is not good to cut 
programs in anticipation of negotiations that undercuts your 
negotiation leverage it undercuts your security 
six months later the pentagon confirmed that it was considering 
forcing two chemical firms to sell the army a key ingredient for 
poison gas the army had used up its supplies of the chemical 
thionyl chloride accrued from the 1950s and had sought new 
supplies from occidental petroleum co and the pittsburghbased 
mobay corp 
both companies have refused to supply the chemical and told the 
pentagon their corporate policies barred them from providing it for 
use in the production of chemical weapons 
pentagon spokesman bob hall said in late march that there were 
other potential sources of the chemicals and he declined to say 
whether the pentagon would invoke its power under the defense 
product act to compel the sale of the material by occidental and 
mobay 
under the agreement to be signed at the summit the two sides 
would immediately cease production of chemical weapons and destroy 
80 percent of their stocks 
by the eighth year both sides would have reduced their supplies 
further to 2 percent of the current level and two years after that 
they hope to destroy the rest if all other countries capable of 
producing chemical weapons join them in a global ban us 
officials said 
the united states and the soviet union are the only two nations 
to acknowledge having chemical weapons although up to a dozen 
including libya and iran are thought to have the grisly 
substances iraqs president saddam hussein has boasted that he has 
them and recently threatened to use them against israel if 
attacked by the jewish state 
the united states has about 32000 tons of poison gas the 
soviet stockpile is believed to be larger 
binary weapons usually artillery shells or missile warheads 
contain two relatively safe compounds that combine to produce toxic 
nerve gases the first use of chemical weapons was outlawed under 
the 1925 geneva protocol

incumbent president 
joaquin balaguer clung to a razorthin lead saturday with most 
ballots counted in a presidential race disputed by his main leftist 
opponent 
but the announcement of a winner was expected to be delayed for 
several days until election officials finish reviewing tallies 
challenger juan bosch of the dominican liberation party 
claimed vote fraud had occurred and agreed to the review after 
threatening to call for civil disturbances 
the count continued at a snails pace saturday four days after 
the election with ballots still being tabulated from 7 percent of 
the more than 6663 polling stations 
balaguer an 83yearold conservative leads former president 
juan bosch an 80yearold selfdeclared marxist who had campaigned 
on a moderate platform by fewer than 20000 votes a mere 05 
percent of the vote the central electoral board reported 
with 6206 of the 6663 polling stations reporting balaguer had 
620181 votes and bosch 601954 jose fransisco pena gomez a 
former socialist mayor of santo domingo mayor had 406070 votes 
about 32 million people were registered to vote and turnout 
was estimated at 60 percent 
although those results are official winners were being 
certified by a laborious process under which thousands of tally 
sheets obtained by political parties from polling stations were 
checked against tallies received by election officials 
the review began saturday in the presence of representatives 
from the four main political parties and could last several days 
officials said all races including 30 senate 120 congressional 
and 103 mayoral contests will be reviewed 
the electoral board ordered the review friday in an agreement 
brokered by former president jimmy carter one of 30 international 
observers to the voting 
both bosch and pena gomez accused balaguer of widespread fraud 
bosch had threatened street protests but called them off friday 
after the board agreed to the electoral review he had said before 
the election he had evidence that balaguers social christian 
reformist party had prepared 300000 phony ballots to rig the 
outcome a charge balaguer denied 
pena gomez a former bosch protege said friday there were 
grave irregularities and votebuying by balaguers party 
before returning to the united states on friday carter said 
none of the candidates had presented any evidence of fraud but 
added he had never observed such a close election 
wednesdays balloting was the fifth election pitting balaguer 
and bosch against each other for leadership of this caribbean 
nation of 7 million people balaguer won three of the four previous 
contests 
balaguer now blinded by glaucoma was first elected president 
in 1966 and served three consecutive fouryear terms before losing 
power in 1978 he was reelected in 1986 
his popularity has waned as the countrys economic crisis 
worsened he presided over a 2 billion public works project that 
is remodeling the capital the project created thousands of jobs 
but fueled inflation while electricity blackouts and water 
shortages continue 
bosch was the first freely elected president after the 
assassination of dictator gen rafael trujillo but the military 
overthrew him in 1963 after only seven months in office 
an attempt by rebel soldiers to restore bosch to power led to 
civil war in 1965 president lyndon johnson sent in 23000 us 
marines to prevent a leftist takeover 
in this election campaign bosch endorsed capitalism to improve 
the economy and pledged good relations with the united states 
bosch held a 10 percent lead in opinion polls before the 
elections but observers said he harmed his chances by criticizing 
a 1954 agreement with the vatican providing that all army chaplains 
are roman catholic the dominican republic is overwhelming catholic

south african president fw de klerk appealed to 
europe on saturday to completely rethink its policy toward his 
country saying the process of change there is irreversible 
in britain on the fifth leg of a european tour de klerk won 
congratulations from prime minister margaret thatcher for his 
reforms 
calling for a fundamental reassessment of europes stand 
toward his country he said the continent generally recognizes 
that there is a new reality in south africa 
the president has initiated a series of racial reforms in his 
country he is now negotiating to bring south africas black 
majority into the political system 
at a news conference he indicated that some countries had had a 
change of heart about issues like their sanctions against south 
africa but were not yet ready to put it into practice 
my general impression is that europe is ready to take specific 
steps is really ready to do this reevaluation de klerk said in 
reply to a question 
but in some countries it is felt that public opinion still 
offers an obstacle to this and that maybe europe will need some 
time before it can concretize the conclusions that they have 
already arrived at 
however de klerk insisted he had not come to europe looking for 
specific measures such as a relaxation of sanctions 
asked about the african national congress demand that sanctions 
be maintained he said i personally think that sanctions in 
general are in any event becoming irrelevant almost by what is 
happening inside south africa and therefore we are not here to 
address that as a primary issue it has not surfaced as such in the 
talks that we have had 
the anc whose deputy president is nelson mandela is the 
leading group fighting the apartheid system of racial separation in 
south africa 
in 1986 the 12nation european economic community banned 
imports of south african iron steel and gold coins after de 
klerks talks in belgium on thursday a community official said it 
was too early to talk of lifting the sanctions 
mrs thatcher broke ranks with her european partners by lifting 
some sanctions against south africa as a gesture of encouragement 
after de klerk released mandela from prison in february he has 
served 27 years of a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to 
overthrow the white government 
apart from his saturday talks and lunch with mrs thatcher at 
chequers her country residence de klerk also met british 
industrialists and bankers 
de klerk declined to give timetables for negotiation or for 
lifting the state of emergency that gives authorities sweeping 
powers to quell black unrest 
however seeking to demonstrate that changes are moving fast he 
said a report by a joint governmentanc committee on the question 
of exiles and political prisoners is almost on the table and on 
my return to south africa it will receive immediate attention 
in johannesburg south africa the government saturday granted 
temporary amnesty to 38 exiled antiapartheid activists including 
anc president oliver tambo and other leaders of the organization 
the amnesty valid until aug 19 will allow anc officials to 
return to south africa for talks with the government designed to 
clear the way for fullscale constitutional negotiations 
in durban about 8000 members of a zulu political party some 
heavily armed marched to the us consulate saturday to call for 
the end to economic sanctions 
representatives of the united kingdom italy and west germany 
also were at the consulate to receive a petition from inkatha a 
relatively conservative group headed by mangosuthu buthelezi 
the inkatha marchers carried pointed sticks spears whips 
knives axes clubs and iron bars as they marched though central 
durban however police took no action and no violence was reported 
earlier a british spokesman said mrs thatcher congratulated de 
klerk for the changes he has brought about and quoted her as 
saying there will be further substantial progress on all fronts 
in the near future 
de klerk visited france greece portugal and belgium before 
arriving here he flies to west germany on sunday and continues to 
switzerland spain and italy

radical reformers saturday proposed amending the 
russian republics constitution to give its laws priority over the 
laws of the soviet union in a direct assault on president mikhail 
s gorbachevs authority 
the draft sovereignty declaration is similar to the ones 
that began the baltic republics drive for independence 18 months 
ago if adopted it could dramatically reduce the power of 
gorbachevs government 
it would allow the russian parliament to push through more 
radical reforms than gorbachev wants in the republic which 
contains 52 percent of the soviet population and threequarters of 
its land mass 
the author of the proposal social democratic leader oleg 
rumyantsev said in an interview he believed it could be approved 
possibly as early as monday 
rumyantsev estimated there are 350 to 500 progressives among the 
1059 members of the newly elected russian parliament who would 
vote for the proposal the positions of several hundred more 
remained unclear 
constitutional amendments normally require a twothirds majority 
to pass 
but rumyantsev noted that 1004 of the legislators nearly all 
voted to move the issue of sovereignty high on the parliaments 
agenda 
this shows that sovereignty could be a possible point of 
consensus he said 
however many of those 1004 legislators undoubtedly share the 
opinion of alexander vlasov the candidate for russian president 
backed by gorbachev he said he supports sovereignty but defined it 
only as a special approach to the unique problems of russia 
the republic laws must must not be superior to the law of the 
soviet union said vlasov the current russian premier at a news 
conference saturday he said if russian leaders do not like a 
national law they have the right to complain and suggest changes 
to the national legislature 
rumyantsev said the gorbachevvlasov forces favor only economic 
sovereignty for russia such as control over its own natural 
resources but he said even this idea requires political 
sovereignty because it contravenes soviet law 
the sovereignty proposal is comparable to an american state 
amending its constitution to claim that it no longer must abide by 
us laws unless they are accepted by the state legislature 
however unlike the us system the soviet constitution says each 
of the 15 republics in the country is a sovereign republic 
without defining the term 
gorbachev has said the sovereignty declarations in the baltic 
states of estonia lithuania and latvia are invalid 
but he did nothing to enforce that decision and the three 
republics then pursued their own economic and political reforms 
regardless of national soviet law the drive culminated this 
spring in declarations of complete independence from the soviet 
union which gorbachev has fought 
using its sovereignty law lithuanias parliament legalized 
noncommunist parties last december outraging hardliners two 
months later however gorbachev asked the national communist party 
to permit identical reform throughout the country 
but allowing the tiny baltics with a total population of 8 
million to succeed in flouting soviet law is far different from 
permitting the same decision in russia the heart of the soviet 
union with 147 million people 
the russian radicals also hope to elect gorbachev critic boris 
yeltsin president of their republic instead of gorbachevs man 
vlasov the agenda calls for the parliament to vote on that after 
deciding the sovereignty issue 
saturday afternoon several hundred people surrounded 
legislators returning from the kremlin to their hotel to chant 
their support for yeltsin yeltsin 
the bureaucrats need vlasov the people need yeltsin one 
poster read 
one middleaged woman who declined to give her name said she 
favored yeltsin because he is a peoples leader who has refused 
all privileges 
hes smart and talented she added 
the sovereignty proposal also could play havoc with gorbachevs 
economic blockade of lithuania which he imposed in hopes of 
forcing the republic to rescind its declaration of independence 
legislator mikhail bocharov a factory manager who has led 
experiments with workers leasing their plants from the government 
said russia should have the power to decide whether to supply oil 
to lithuania 
that is the affair of a sovereign state bocharov said in 
last weeks new times magazine 
yuri kovalchenko another man in the crowd of yeltsin 
supporters said he favored giving more authority to the russian 
parliament because it was more professional and democratically 
oriented than the national one 
the national parliament was elected last year in the soviet 
unions first multicandidate elections and it includes many 
hardliners 
the russian parliament was elected this spring after the people 
had experienced a full year of democratic reform and includes a 
greater proportion of progressives

when the first evacuation call came folks 
in this river bottom town thought the spring floods would wash 
through their neighborhoods for a few days at most 
now nerves are fraying as they learn the highest waters this 
century may keep them away from home for months 
hundreds have dug in at camp grounds emergency shelters and 
hotels and some dont even know if they have a home to return to 
stop and think if its your house and you dont know 
said chris dozier her eyes filling with tears some people might 
say its only a home but its not only a home when its your 
home 
mrs dozier 63 and her husband like several hundred others 
were forced this week to leave the camilla twin harbors subdivision 
just below lake livingston dam 
authorities this week have been releasing record amounts of 
water from the dams floodgates inundating lowlying areas 
because heavy rain swelled the trinity river upstream 
since thursday water has gushed through at a rate of 756000 
gallons a second and the trinity river authority says releases 
will continue for another five or six days 
mrs dozier said she and her husband knew they were building in 
a flood plain 10 years ago but they never expected water to reach 
the rooftops 
the retired couple has been staying at a motel for a week and a 
half but say they cant afford to stay there much longer 
spring flooding has long been considered an inconvenience but 
not a disaster until this flood and a lesser one last june 
we were never even told to expect anything like this said 
louis dozier gazing down at a flooded pasture near the river 
that looks like a nice lake there doesnt it normally thats 
grange land for the cattle the rivers supposed to be on the other 
side of those trees 
the doziers said they like many neighbors will rebuild and 
take their chances because they cant afford to move 
authorities say it could take all summer for enough water to 
recede to let residents return to the areas below the dam 
ed lepley san jacinto county emergency management coordinator 
said camilla twin harbors residents were evacuated because up to 20 
feet of water endangered them and rescue workers 
when we bought the land they told us it wasnt in a flood 
plain lamented rebecca ward who with her husband curtis 
brooks has lived in the nearby cedar valley subdivision for five 
years 
stress showed on their faces as they headed to a rented house in 
houston where theyll wait for the water to leave their river 
bottom home 
the retired couple plan to return but will put their trailer on 
higher blocks brooks said 
of those evacuees who think theyll stay many said they dont 
know how much it will cost to rebuild because they havent been 
able to see their property 
bill and audrey wyatt said theyve had it with life in the flood 
plain though theyll keep their camilla twin harbors property as a 
vacation getaway they bought their trailer last year right before 
the june flood 
we dont want to give up the place but i dont want to live 
here any more weve been through this twice in one year mrs 
wyatt said 
for the past week they have camped at the grocery and marina 
campground with about 200 other subdivision refugees camp owners 
give them free sites water and utilities 
mrs wyatt shaky from being unable to sleep since leaving home 
said theyll leave the area as soon as their 9yearold daughter 
finishes school june 2 
theres snakes galore rats galore alligators over on fourth 
street mrs wyatt said its a little much

seven chefs were up to their elbows in cornish 
game hens veal oysters and other ingredients as dawn broke 
saturday hoping to create the top taste and palate pleaser to earn 
them a spot at the culinary olympics 
the cooking competition started at 6 am kicking off the 
national restaurant association international trade show at the 
citys lakefront mccormick place convention center the show runs 
through wednesday 
thirtythree chefs will be in the kitchen this week vying for 
25 spots at the international cooking championship in west germany 
next year the winners of the national competition will be 
announced tuesday 
out of the kitchen however the restaurateurs are faced with a 
keener competition for the customer 
the thing thats probably affecting all of them is the 
overdevelopment of the industry too many restaurants growing too 
fast in too many areas said michael hurst the associations 
president 
a hot topic in the restaurant industry is a trend among 
expensive formal restaurants toward socalled downscaling 
a suburban restaurant boom throughout the 1980s produced an 
abundance of good closetohome restaurants that drew customers 
away from very expensive formal downtown restaurants hurst said 
you tended to be able almost to cut the grass and go get 
something to eat he said you might prefer once in a while to 
get dressed up and go back downtown but its a thing thats done 
less often 
in the fight to regain customers some restaurants are scaling 
down that can take the form of lowering prices redecorating 
adding lowercost entrees or shutting down and reopening 
completely under a different concept he said 
for the duration of the fiveday trade show chicago restaurants 
will have no lack of customers for several evenings thousands of 
the toughest critics in the country will be looking for a place to 
eat 
were totally totally booked said luann bayless manager 
of the citys popular frontera grill 
more than 100000 people from the restaurant and hotel industry 
in the us and 70 other countries are expected for the conference 
this is the greatest meeting place of suppliers and users in 
the hospitality industry said richard cregar a member of the 
associations board of directors and chairman of the convention 
those who attend will browse among 2000 companies equipment 
and supply lines everything from cream puffs to washing 
machines cregar said 
many of the products on the exhibit floor bring technological 
innovations to the restaurant 
sweet art of kansas city is displaying birthday cakes decorated 
with computergenerated reproductions of photographs 
jeron technology of boca raton fla is marketing a noiseless 
beeper thats intended for use by the kitchen staff to summon the

president mikhail s gorbachev on saturday called 
for legalizing private ownership of homes and residential lots 
challenging a 73yearold communist law that stipulates state 
ownership of all such property 
the official tass news agency said he made the proposal in an 
attempt to solve the nations critical shortage of housing 
all soviet land is now owned by the state under one of the 
strongest tenets of communism however soviet leaders have already 
approved private ownership of buildings equipment and factories 
gorbachevs decree instructed the government to formulate new 
measures by sept 1 that would double the pace of building 
individual homes and apartments 
tass said gorbachev ordered a housing plan that removes the 
whole number of restrictions on building individual housing in the 
soviet union grants the right to own and inherit housing and the 
plots on which it is built 
the housing plan would overturn the land decree of 1917 that 
nationalized all private land holdings 
the law was the precursor to dictator josef stalins massive 
collectivization of farms in the 1930s the collectivization cost 
of millions of lives through starvation and many peasants who 
resisted were sent to forced labor camps 
gorbachevs decree saturday called for at least 30 million new 
apartments and houses by the year 2000 to meet gorbachevs pledge 
of individual dwellings for all soviets by the end of the century 
the seriousness of the housing problem has not lessened the 
decree said it is obvious that solving the housing problem with 
current methods is impossible 
gorbachevs calltoaction urged legislation allowing individual 
bank loans for housing construction construction of apartments for 
immediate sale and a sharp increase in the availability of 
construction materials now virtually unavailabile to individuals 
because they are allocated to government agencies 
gorbachevs decree said there have been recent positive shifts 
in solving the housing problems but the problem is still acute 
nearly 45 million families live in housing with less than five 
square meters yards per person it said 
five square meters is about half the size of a small western 
bedroom 
the longrange plan is to develop a housing market in which 
every family can choose whether it wants an apartment or a house 
gorbachevs decree said 
it did not spell out whether individuals would have the right to 
sell property purchased from the government but it warned against 
speculation the soviet term for selling at a profit 
the supreme soviet legislature in march approved private 
ownership of buildings equipment and factories but under 
gorbachevs direction it rejected legalizing private ownership of 
land 
just a month later gorbachevs advisory board was reported to 
be reconsidering that policy 
at the time gorbachev spokesman arkady maslennikov told a news 
conference that economists believed the widespread sale of 
apartments and possibly land could help soak up a vast pool of 
billions of rubles in private bank accounts and under mattresses 
for which there are no goods to buy

six members of an international drug ring 
were convicted of distributing tons of cocaine in a case 
authorities say was one of the first to link a colombian cocaine 
cartel to los angeles street gangs 
the gangs two leaders brian waterhead bo bennett and mario 
ernesto villabona alvarado faced mandatory life prison sentences 
without possibility of parole under a federal drug kingpin law 
the other four convicted friday with bennett and villabona by a 
us district court jury could each receive prison terms of 10 
years to life at sentencing scheduled july 30 
villabona 29 also was ordered to forfeit to the government 
750000 discovered in bank accounts in denmark 
its very significant because its one of the first to 
establish a connection between colombian cartels bringing enormous 
amounts of cocaine into this country and black gangs said 
assistant us attorney dean g dunlavey 
authorities say bennett 24 is a los angeles gang member and 
villabona is a highranking official in the cali cocaine cartel 
prosecutors contended that villabona imported tons of cocaine to 
los angeles and bennett supervised distribution to gangs that sold 
it in los angeles san francisco detroit and other cities 
bennett and villabona were convicted of operating a continuing 
criminal enterprise 
each of the six defendants was convicted of conspiring to 
possess thousands of kilograms of cocaine with intent to distribute 
and of possessing nearly 1000 kilograms of cocaine each 
also convicted were maria cecilia fatima barona luz janneth 
martinez michael harris and michael dubarry mccarver all of los 
angeles 
as the verdicts were read martinez hung her head and sobbed 
the others showed no emotion 
defense attorneys said they would appeal claiming that wiretap 
recordings and other evidence used by the prosecution should not 
have been admitted 
if the department of justice thinks that convicting these 
young people is going to do one thing to stop the flow of drugs 
theyre crazy martinez attorney david chesnoff told reporters 
federal investigators testified the defendants laundered drug 
proceeds through bank accounts in panama and denmark authorities 
said villabona and bennett also bought legitimate businesses 
including a chain ofcheckcashing outlets to launder drug money 
prosecutors said mccarver and harris served as cocaine 
distributors while martinez and fatima arranged shipments of cash

european community foreign ministers 
gathered at this southwest ireland resort saturday to work on a 
blueprint for a political union of europe by 1993 
this is the start of a major exercise said irish foreign 
minister gerry collins chairman of the twoday meeting in an 
interview with irish radio 
he spoke as the ministers of the 12nation community met at 
parknasilla a picturesque garden resort overlooking kenmare bay 
ireland holds the rotating presidency of the body of western 
european nations 
the meeting was the ministers first attempt to draw up draft 
proposals on a political union to present to the communitys heads 
of state at a meeting at the end of june 
at a special summit in dublin on april 28 community leaders 
agreed in principle to achieve a closer political union by 1993 
in june the leaders are expected to convene an 
intergovernmental conference on political union despite british 
reservations the european community plans to create a vast common 
market by the end of 1992 
britain has been skeptical toward the idea of a political union 
and has proposed that the communitys elected assembly the 
518member european parliament is only given powers to control the 
groups spending and to monitor compliance by member states with 
communitywide regulations 
but france and west germany backed by italy and belgium have 
argued that western europe must forge greater ties as a stabilizing 
force in europe 
france favors power centered in the heads of government while 
west germany favors greater powers for the european parliament 
based in strasbourg france 
several smaller community nations including ireland have been 
reluctant to increase the powers of the parliament which allocates 
seats according to population

the government is prosecuting the 
czechoslovak communist party for stealing from the state 
prosecutor general pavel rychetsky was quoted as saying saturday 
rychetsky made the announcement at a rally in prague according 
to the state news agency ctk he demanded the communist party give 
up all property unlawfully acquired during its more than 40year 
rule 
we consider it our primary duty to introduce order and justice 
in this country rychetsky said in the presence of czechoslovak 
president vaclav havel 
i can therefore tell you that his office launched 
criminal proceedings on charges of stealing from the state by the 
communist party he added 
according to witnesses at the rally rychetsky did not provide 
any names or specify the charges but reliable sources indicated 
that current officials of the communist party could be investigated 
in the near future 
four of the 22 political parties running in czechoslovakias 
parliamentary elections june 89 have demanded outlawing the 
communist party but the appeal was rejected both by havel and the 
federal parliament 
however there is general agreement among all political forces 
in the country that much of the partys property should be 
confiscated 
quoting participants at the rally ctk said property acquired by 
communists over the last 18 years alone amounted to about 1 
billion 
rychetsky said most of the criminal acts under investigation now 
would fall under an amnesty declared by havel on jan1 
however the moral condemnation by the nation and the 
publishing of our findings will undoubtedly be necessary he said 
it was near clear if unlawful acquisition of property would be 
covered by the amnesty 
czechoslovakia caught up in the democratic tide last year 
swore in its noncommunist government in december

important

you are the best judge of what you can do 
gorbachev has imposed a partial economic blockade against 
lithuania while also advising the leaders there to pursue 
constitutional means in seeking independence that process could 
take five years 
meanwhile the two other baltic states estonia and latvia 
also are pushing for independence from the soviet union 
gorbachev told baker he did not have a lot of room to 
maneuver on the baltic situation the us official said 
he gorbachev made it clear he understood the lithuanians 
could not simply give in to a diktat and that he could not simply 
demand they revoke the declaration because that would put them in a 
position that would be untenable the official added he said 
there would have to be a compromise

lithuanias prime minister saturday urged 
lawmakers in her breakaway republic not to suspend their 
declaration of independence despite soviet demands and reports of 
a us suggestion they do so 
although soviet president mikhail s gorbachev now insists on 
suspension rather than revocation of the march 11 action prime 
minister kazimiera prunskiene said either step would put the 
republic back under moscows thumb 
she met with gorbachev on thursday in moscow and lithuanias 
parliament held an emergency session saturday in vilnius the 
republics capital to hear about the latest efforts at compromise 
in the standoff with the kremlin over independence 
as mrs prunskiene addressed the lawmakers about 10000 singing 
and flagwaving people rallied outside to show their support and to 
protect the building from antiindependence activists vilnius 
radio reported 
gorbachev has said the other two baltic republics estonia and 
latvia violated the soviet constitution with the steps they have 
taken toward independence but he has not imposed economic 
sanctions on them as he has against lithuania 
gorbachev has cut off all oil and most of the natural gas 
supplied to lithuania as well as some raw materials for its 
secessionist moves 
we must take as many steps toward the other side as we can 
mrs prunskiene said according to parliamentary spokesman ed 
tuskenis 
she noted that both gorbachev and secretary of state james a 
baker iii had urged a temporary suspension of the declaration of 
independence tuskenis said she met with baker on friday 
vice president ceslovas stankevicius who was with mrs 
prunskiene during her meeting with baker told the lawmakers that 
bakers suggestion of a suspension does not mean an annulment 
of the declaration tuskenis said 
but on saturday a senior us official denied baker had urged 
mrs prunskiene to suspend the declaration of independence 
in fact the official said baker had assured the lithuanian 
prime minister that the bush administration wanted the independence 
movement to succeed 
whatever decision you take it is one we are going to 
support the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
quoted baker as saying this is exactly what he said 
earlier at a news conference in moscow baker was asked whether 
he had pressed mrs prunskiene to retract the declaration 
i did not press them he said i said dialogue was 
important 
tuskenis quoted mrs prunskiene as saying her meeting with 
gorbachev while being a difficult session signaled a positive 
evaluation in general because his position on the declaration had 
moved from revocation to suspension gorbachev insisted 
however that the declaration be suspended as a minimum 
requirement she said 
what remained unclear is whether suspension of the declaration 
would mean that soviet laws would go back in force in lithuania 
she said 
a suspension would be too risky because lithuania would revert 
to the status of being the lithuanian ssr soviet socialist 
republic instead of the republic of lithuania tuskenis quoted 
her as saying 
since march 11 and throughout the kremlin economic embargo 
lithuanian officials have refused to roll back on their 
declaration they have said that other issues such as 
proindependence laws may be negotiated 
at a news conference in moscow baker said soviet and lithuanian 
leaders were working harder to find a way to settle their dispute 
peacefully but they are not there yet 
after mrs prunskienes speech lawmakers began to debate her 
proposals said rita dapkus a parliamentary spokeswoman but they 
were not expected to take immediate action 
ms dapkus and eduard potashinskas an editor at the lithuanian 
television station said the crowd that gathered outside the 
supreme council building included volunteers who were recruited to 
guard the building against any actions by antiindependence 
protesters 
on tuesday in latvia and estonia crowds opposed to secession 
from moscow tried to enter those republics parliaments but were 
forced back by proindependence supporters and local police 
the official soviet news agency tass said the soviet interior 
ministry on saturday dispatched extra units to the republics to 
assist local authorities in working out and implementing concrete 
measures on strengthening law and order 
many russians and other ethnic minorities in the baltic 
republics complain that they are discriminated against because of 
the independence movements the republics were forcibly annexed by 
josef stalin in 1940

the nations first plastic stamp one that takes 
no licking to keep it sticking went on sale saturday through 
automated teller machines at banks 
over the next six months 22 atms in the seattle area will 
dispense the limitededition 25cent stamps in a test to see 
whether people will buy them and if banks want to sell them said 
us postmaster general anthony frank 
we think atm stamps represent a good idea and a technological 
milestone frank said at a firstdayofissue ceremony friday 
the stamps which feature an abstract american flag need no 
moisture to stick you simply peel one off a sheet of backing and 
post it on your letter 
they are humidity and tearresistant and were designed to have 
the thickness of a dollar bill to be dispensed through 24hour 
bank machines 
the 10layer stamp is basically a polyester film over a 
pressureadhesive with a watersoluble primer less than 
fivethousandths of an inch thick it is dispensed in sheets of 12 
roughly the size of a dollar bill 
it is not biodegradable but can be soaked off envelopes and 
recycled by companies that deal with mixed materials said alan 
gotcher vice president in charge of corporate research for the 
stamps developer avery international corp the company makes 
pressure adhesives 
if the marketing test succeeds avery plans to seek a contract 
to make up to 1 billion of the stamps gotcher said he said the 
company has patents on some of the technology to develop the 
adhesive but not on the stamp itself 
the postal service and seafirst bank came up with the idea of 
the bankdispensed stamp harry zelenko of new york city designed 
it 
the ultimate goal is to develop a similar stamp made of 
recyclable paper frank said 
at fridays ceremony in seattles columbiaseafirst tower 
people lined up to buy firstday covers the festivities also 
included a jazz band an honor guard and a seafirst choral group 
only 2 million of the stamps have been printed so they are 
likely to become a valuable collectors item said jim hall a 
member of the collectors club of seattle and a parttime stamp 
dealer 
its quite innovative its just a test stamp so it will be 
above average in value more valuable than other commemorative 
stamps said hall who bought 30 sheets and 15 firstday covers 
he estimated that one of the stamps could be worth a dollar 
within a few years

oregons health officials met saturday to 
rework a health care rationing plan that ranked crooked teeth near 
the top of its list and aids treatment near the bottom 
the oregon health care commissions draft list of medical 
priorities was widely rebuked when it was released earlier this 
month even panel members admitted that major surgery was needed on 
the way the computerized list ranked certain illnesses 
oregons medicaid reform plan was designed to increase the 
number of people who receive basic health care by limiting the most 
expensive and least effective treatments 
after 11 public hearings and 50 community meetings the 
commission devised a formula in which the cost of treatment was 
divided by the duration of benefits and the quality of wellbeing 
a factor that measures how a patient would fare with treatment as 
opposed to without treatment 
the formula was applied to some 1600 medical procedures and fed 
into a computer the result was a document so loaded with errors 
the commission considered withholding it 
its a ponderous complicated almost overwhelming collection 
of data but we had to start somewhere said commission chairman 
bill gregory in releasing the list may 2 
on saturday the panel heard from invited health care 
professionals in its efforts to rework the list on sunday the 
commission planned to continue working on the flaws of the list 
craig irwin of the oregon transplant project criticized the 
list as incomplete and inaccurate both in cost analyses and 
treatment alternatives irwin also said the ranking failed to 
consider the human factor in treating illness 
the panel had hoped to submit the list to gov neil goldschmidt 
by july 1 
but brad buvinger of the consumer action organization oregon 
fair share urged the panel to take its time in preparing the list 
rather than bend to pressure from the public and the oregon 
legislature 
dont get too carried away with that list warned panel 
member yayoe kuramitsu we havent even started to sort through 
it 
one of the few encouraging witnesses was dr ralph crawshaw of 
the medical consulting firm oregon health decisions 
although he criticized the way the news media had reacted to the 
raw list crawshaw said the open and complete disclosure of the 
committees actions is probably the most powerful insurance 
that the final report will have wide public acceptance 
rather than reworking the list the panel discussed whether a 
different formula might yield a more useful ranking 
dr harvey klevit said the panel ought to consider whether the 
duration factor ought to be the same when a medical condition is 
treated or not treated he cited the example of a cancer patient 
who may live five years with treatment and only two years without 
treatment 
on the other hand klevit questioned whether a chicken pox 
patient would receive any longrange benefit since the disease 
would probably go away with or without treatment 
dr richard wopat questioned whether the panel was wasting its 
time on trying to find the perfect formula 
i like the idea of science and using an objective formula 
said wopat but health care doesnt lend itself to formulas 
dr tina castanares of hood river and dr paul kirk of portland 
agreed that it was worthwhile for the panel to rework the formula 
maybe were not applying science to the list but were 
applying fairness said castanares 
state welfare officials estimate the completed plan will add 
77000 new clients to the current list of 130000 medicaid 
recipients before it can go into effect oregon must get 
permission from congress or the department of health and human 
services to alter its medicaid program

a federal prosecutor said saturday he would 
discuss bringing civil rights charges against a white youth 
acquitted of murder in the death of a black teenager 
us attorney andrew maloney said he and district attorney 
charles hynes would consider statements made to reporters by a 
woman who said she witnessed the killing of yusuf hawkins 
her comments were publicized friday after a jury acquitted keith 
mondello 19 of murder and manslaughter charges he was found 
guilty of 12 lesser charges including riot unlawful imprisonment 
and discrimination 
prosecutors charged mondello with being the ringleader of a mob 
that attacked hawkins and three black friends when they went to the 
predominantly white neighborhood of bensonhurst looking for a used 
car 
i understand a new witness has come forward maloney told 
the associated press in a telephone interview i will be 
discussing with mr hynes to find out if anything can or should be 
done 
the woman told reporters that she heard mondello urge 
codefendant joseph fama to shoot the 16yearold 
fama 19 was convicted thursday of seconddegree murder in the 
killing of hawkins by a second jury that heard the same testimony 
fama was accused of being the trggerman in the aug 23 attack 
the 50yearold woman who asked to be identified only as 
maria claimed she didnt come forward earlier because she 
feared retribution she said she tried to telephone the judge who 
presided over the case last week but a court clerk rebuffed her 
because she refused to give her name 
she told reporters friday that she saw fama hesitate then shoot 
hawkins when mondello reportedly said shoot him hes just a 
nigger 
maloney in dicussing possible civil rights charges cautioned 
that the federal governments jurisdiction for civil rights 
prosecution was limited the law requires some effect on 
interstate commerce for example prohibiting someone from using 
a lunch diner or rioting on a bus he said 
there has never been a prosecution authorized since the bill 
was passed 25 years ago for simply racial assaults involving people 
walking down the street he said 
patrick clark a spokesman for the district attorney refused to 
comment when asked if authorities had talked to the woman or 
investigated her remarks 
supporters of the hawkins family took to the street friday night 
after the mondello verdict but there was little violence five 
local television news employees received minor injuries in attacks 
by demonstrators 
the rev al sharpton an activist who has been an adviser to 
hawkins parents said saturday that he did not condone the attacks 
on the tv crews 
we must continue to go to bensonhurst until people know that 
anybody of our race has a right to go anywhere in this nation that 
we helped build he said at a news conference before addressing a 
rally 
sharpton later led about 500 marchers through bensonhurst 
starting from the corner where hawkins was killed about 500 local 
residents mostly young people lined the route 
no peace no peace and yusuf yusuf the marchers 
chanted murderers murderers 
animals the spectators yelled back 
some youths threw watermelons at the marchers others spit at 
them 
my grandfather owned your grandfather shouted dylano 
marchetti 
but other local residents sounded a conciliatory note 
parishioners of the lefferts park baptist church stood along the 
route holding signs that read pray for the peace of brooklyn 
and bensonhurst is not guilty but grieved 
i dont believe that a few speak for the majority david 
schulter the churchs pastor said of the shouting youths beside 
him 
about 500 police officers lined the 10block march route but 
authorities said there were no arrests or major incidents 
meanwhile prosecutors geared up for their case against joseph 
vento 21 one of five white males still awaiting trial on 
seconddegree murder and other charges for their part in the mob 
that surrounded hawkins 
a sixth defendant is charged with firstdegree assault 
vento is scheduled for a pretrial hearing at triallevel state 
supreme court on monday clark said saturday 
after the killing vento told investigators he saw fama shoot 
hawkins and was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for 
his testimony 
but late last year he fled the city after surrendering in ohio 
in march vento backed out of the deal and was indicted by a grand 
jury 
we want the judge to push this case assistant district 
attorney edward boyar told the daily news its certainly our 
strongest case vento hangs himself

israel told egypt it will not launch a first 
military strike on any arab nation a government official said 
saturday 
israel refused to confirm or deny it had made any new assurances 
but said its longstanding policy is not to start any wars 
however in june 1981 israeli warplanes bombed and destroyed an 
iraqi nuclear reactor on the outskirts of the capital baghdad 
egypt may have elicited the reported promise to allay arab fears 
that israel was preparing to launch a military strike on iraq to 
cripple its burgeoning weapons industry 
the egyptian government official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said israel gave the assurance in recent contacts with 
president hosni mubaraks government he refused to give details 
the officials statement followed a report distributed by 
egypts state middle east news agency the agency said it had 
learned from unidentified sources that in a recent contact 
israel gave egypt a promise that it will not be the first to 
attack any arab state 
it said israel also told cairo that it was anxious for the 
continuation of the peace process with egypt and for the 
achievement of peace with other arab countries 
avi pazner a spokesman for israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir said saturday that israel sought to reach out and change 
its relationship with arab countries but did not confirm or deny 
the report about new assurances 
pazner reached by telephone said it is our longstanding 
policy for the last 42 years since israels founding never to 
attack an arab state 
egypt and israel signed a ussponsored peace treaty in 1979 
the egyptians thus became the first and remain the only arab people 
not in a state of war with the jewish state 
egyptian officials said mubarak in direct talks or diplomatic 
contacts with western leaders has been trying to defuse a crisis 
involving their relations with iraq 
since april britain and several other european countries have 
impounded iraqbound parts of what they characterized as a super 
gun capable of firing nuclear or chemical warheads hundreds of 
miles to iranian or israeli territory iraq has denied having or 
developing nuclear arms 
in a speech last month president saddam hussein of iraq said he 
would destroy half of israel with chemical weapons from his arsenal 
if israel mounted a nuclear attack on iraq 
the iraqi leader has accused israel and the west of trying to 
undermine his efforts to build a strong military arsenal

president bush welcomed the outcome of arms 
talks in moscow on saturday as a major step forward in improved 
ussoviet relations and a breakthrough toward a reduction in 
nuclear weapons 
in a commencement address at the university of texas bush 
heralded progress reported earlier in the day by secretary of state 
james a baker iii after four days of talks in moscow 
while there is additional work to be done i think jim bakers 
meetings represent a major step forward the president said 
this breakthrough should allow us to reach the important goal 
we set in malta completing the major substantive elements of an 
historic strategic arms reduction treaty 
in addition bush added we will be able to conclude other 
arms control measures with the soviets including an agreement on 
dramatic reductions in chemical weapons as well as technical and 
commercial agreements 
i am confident that the progress we have made will allow this 
summit to be another solid step forward in the vital ussoviet 
relationship 
earlier in houston bush had pronounced himself encouraged by 
the progress of the moscow talks but said it will take some 
give from the soviet union for his upcoming summit with mikhail 
s gorbachev to be a success 
we still have some unfulfilled arms control problems i think 
were all familiar with bush told reporters as he toured the 
site of julys sevennation economic summit 
bush also visited an area hard hit by floods and was 
participating in a celebrity golf tournament 
the president gave what he called a mixed review on the 
outcome of bakers presummit arms negotiations with soviet leaders 
some encouraging things and some things that still remain to 
be solved bush said 
in moscow baker announced that a trailblazing agreement had 
been reached on banning chemical weapons and that major disputes 
had been resolved on cutting longrange nuclear weapons 
however baker conceded a failure to break a stalemate on 
reducing troops and tanks in europe 
bush speaking to reporters at the john kirby mansion the 
headquarters for the houston economic summit said we want the 
gorbachev summit to be successful its going to take some give on 
the soviet side in my view but were going to keep pushing 
bush did not elaborate 
the president said his national security adviser brent 
scowcroft planned to be in touch with baker later in the day to 
get more details on the talks

he cautioned that such a treaty probably will not be ready for 
signing at the upcoming summit but said the details yet to be 
worked out are not the kind of things we would consider treaty

livingston and the trinity river had forced hundreds of people on

after flying over the region by helicopter bush talked with 
local flood workers and surveyed the surging waters beneath the 
dam which submerged a recreation and boat launching area 
bush greeted several dozen onlookers and commented that

report scientific panel looking at dumping iron in ocean to slow 
warming 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a special panel of the national research 
council has given quiet endorsement to a proposal by several 
scientists to battle the greenhouse effect by dumping iron into 
the oceans to stimulate plant growth according to a published 
report 
the washington post says in sundays editions that the panel 
concluded it is conceptually feasible to slow the increase in 
atmospheric carbon dioxide by fertilizing the oceans with iron 
the idea is that the iron would stimulate growth of marine 
algae which in turn would soak up some of the excess carbon 
dioxide in the air that is believed to be responsible for global 
warming 
the post said the panels report which has not been made 
public recommends that after careful modeling and appropriate 
preliminary experiments a large international iron enrichment 
experiment be implemented at a cost of between 50 million and 
150 million 
it says researchers have suggested that the first experiment be 
conducted off the coast of antarctica or alaska 
the national research council is an arm of the national 
academies of sciences and engineering which is an independent 
organization chartered by congress to advise the government on 
scientific medical and technical issues 
you give me half a tanker full of iron ill give you another 
ice age said john martin of moss landing marine laboratories in 
california one of several private scientists quoted by the post 
i think it is a good idea said roger revelle former 
director of the scripps institution of oceanography i see no 
reason why it shouldnt work 
a third scientist quoted by the paper anthony michaels of the 
bermuda biological station for research said there are lots of 
unknowns but it is an enticing idea that is being actively 
pursued

federal officials plan to declare how much money 
the united states paid gen manuel antonio noriega according to a 
published report 
the new york times reported sunday that the us government will 
disclose the amount at a federal court hearing in miami on monday 
the amount an unidentified government official told the times 
is far less than the 11 million noriegas chief defense lawyer 
says the former panamanian dictator claims to have been paid 
the lawyer frank a rubino said part of his case might include 
videotaped testimony from cuban president fidel castro 
rubino told the times he hopes to show that noriega carried out 
many apparently illegal activities with the compliance and 
sometimes assistance of american intelligence agencies 
the lawyer said he intends to subpoena current and former 
american intelligence officials as well as classified documents 
to support his clients contention that he was acting as an agent 
of the united states 
i will show that sure he did some notnice things but that 
he did them as part of operations that he was carrying out for our 
government rubino told the newspaper 
federal prosecutors have not moved yet to block on national 
security grounds the introduction of classified material in the 
case against noriega 
noriega after years of being a paid american agent was seized 
in december after us troops invaded panama noriega was indicted 
by two grand juries in florida in 1988 on a dozen counts of cocaine 
trafficking and racketeering involving shipment of drugs to the 
united states 
rubino said castro gave him documents that would help noriegas 
defense the times report did not say what those documents might be 
or contain

the former head of the national urban league 
said saturday that president bush risks widespread protests and 
destruction of his popularity among blacks if he vetoes civil 
rights legislation pending before congress 
black people may have forgiven george bush for the willie 
horton ads but there will be no forgiveness for vetoing a bill 
that saves basic civil rights from the tender mercies of the reagan 
supreme court jordan told the george mason university graduating 
class in suburban fairfax va 
a veto would unleash a firestorm of protest that would 
permanently rupture the administrations credibility and galvanize 
black people and white people who believe in the power of the law 
to right the wrongs of racism he said 
critics said 1988 presidential campaign ads to boost bushs 
image as a toughoncrime candidate were racist in their use of 
horton a black convicted killer who raped a woman while on 
furlough from a massachusetts prison 
jordan served as the leagues president from 1972 to 1981 
leaders of major civil rights organizations have urged bush not 
to veto the civil rights act of 1990 that would overturn several 
controversial 1989 supreme court decisions in the area of 
employment discrimination 
however bush last week said he objected to key provisions of the 
proposal that could lead to hiring quotas

south korean protesters held a sitin 
in front of the japanese embassy on friday for the fifth 
consecutive day to demand an apology by japans emperor for 
colonial rule of korea 
some of their placards asked president roh taewoo to cancel his 
threeday visit to japan next week roh has been under mounting 
public pressure to put off the visit unless emperor akihito makes 
such an apology 
the protesters relatives of koreans drafted by japan and killed 
during world war ii were demanding an apology and compensation for 
japans wartime acts 
the protest began monday when about a dozen people all more 
than 50 years old sat on the ground about 15 yards from the 
embassys main gate shouting akihito apologize about 60 riot 
police guarded the embassy but there have been no arrests 
the protesters gather in the morning and stay several hours 
after nightfall reading statements and chanting slogans 
minor scuffles have broken out only when the protesters 
screaming slogans try to run after cars carrying japanese 
diplomats some irate protesters hurled eggs on thursday 
the late emperor hirohito who died in january 1989 said in 
1984 he sincerely regretted that there was an unfortunate past 
between the two countries 
however south korean officials have said the apology was 
unclear to the korean people 
prime minister toshiki kaifu of japan has said he will apologize 
to the korean people next week but japanese officials have 
resisted calls for akihito to make a formal apology saying the 
emperor the symbol of the japanese state should not be used for 
political purposes 
antijapanese sentiment is strong among many elderly koreans who 
remember japans harsh colonial rule following the russojapanese 
war japan annexed korea in 1910 and controlled it until the end of 
world war ii 
during the war japan drafted hundreds of thousands of koreans 
as soldiers and forced laborers 
in japan on friday authorities reported two suspected arson 
attacks linked to rohs visit 
three cars were destroyed in one attack by suspected leftist 
extremists at a state police headquarters in omiya just north of 
tokyo police said 
local authorities reported a separate fire at housing facilities 
for south korean residents in nagoya central japan on thursday 
evening 
no one was reported injured in either incident and only minor 
damage was reported to the building 
radical extremist groups that oppose rohs visit claim it is a 
step toward reviving the japanese empire as it existed earlier in 
the century

researchers say they may have found the 65 
millionyearold crater left by a giant meteorite that some 
scientists blame for the extinction of the dinosaurs 
traces of a hole 180 miles across have been found beneath the 
caribbean sea two university of arizona researchers report in 
fridays journal science they suggested an asteroid or comet fell 
to the seafloor 3 miles below the oceans surface and plunged 50 
miles into the earths mantle 
planetary sciences professor william v boynton and alan r 
hildebrand a doctoral candidate in planetary sciences theorized 
the impact created a wave up to three miles high that dumped 
debris in what is now mexico and throughout the southern and 
eastern united states 
at least since 1980 late physicist luis alvarez his son 
walter and others theorized that most of the dinosaurs might have 
been wiped out as a result of a giant asteroid or comet striking 
the earth 
im only cautiously optimistic walter alvarez an earth 
sciences professor at the university of californiaberkeley said 
by telephone friday if it is indeed the impact site then we 
have the smoking gun we would like to find the site that would 
tie up the theory 
the researchers analyzed 65millionyearold rock samples from 
surface and deepsea holes around the world for signs of debris 
tossed up by the impact 
i think the evidence is compelling that the impact had to be 
somewhere in this region hildebrand said thursday of the area 
about 180 miles northwest of what is now colombia 
the pair has identified a possible impact crater which they 
believe to be 180 miles in diameter about twice the size of any 
known crater from terrestrial impact

whenever wall street is ailing few remedies 
offer stronger curative powers than a simple dose of lower interest 
rates 
at least that would seem to be the message of what has happened 
over the past few weeks when the fortunes of both the stock and 
bond markets took a dramatic turn for the better 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks after languishing 
for months in what technical analysts call a trading range has 
abruptly jumped to record highs the bond market likewise has come 
to life after a slump through the winter and early spring 
inflation and recession fears have faded stock market seers are 
setting their sights on targets like the 3000 mark for the dow 
amid all the enthusiasm however some analysts have begun to 
question whether some caution isnt warranted as well 
even if interest rates were to keep falling the way they have 
been since the beginning of may these observers maintain the news 
might not be an unalloyed plus for the stock market 
prices of topgrade bonds are directly linked to interestrate 
expectations as long as expectations dont change much about a 
bond issuers presumed ability to make interest and principal 
payments when they come due 
but the connection between interest rate fluctuations and stocks 
is more tenuous many analysts say 
for one thing the benefits of sluggish growth and low inflation 
for stocks can be diminished by worries that a recovery in 
corporate profits may be delayed 
i still believe the world economy will slow and inflation will 
ebb in the second half of this year and through the first half of 
next year writes barton biggs at morgan stanley amp co in a 
current strategy bulletin 
for a while this represents better news for bonds than for 
stocks because the economic combination i anticipate will cause 
many companies to report profits below consensus expectations 
lower interest rates justify higher priceearnings ratios but 
they dont validate higher prices unless the profits part of the 
equation matches expectations 
in a similar appraisal wright investors service of bridgeport 
conn argues that evidence of a weak economy and moderate 
inflation bode well for the bond market over the balance of the 
year 
stock prices on the other hand are expected to move lower 
mainly because weak business conditions are likely to keep 
corporate profits under pressure for the foreseeable future 
such warnings didnt deter bullish stock traders in the past 
week the dow jones industrial average climbed 1833 points to 
281991 hitting record highs in three of the weeks five trading 
days 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 131 to 19355 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market gained 
1021 to 44831 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was up 382 at 35632 
volume on the big board averaged 17565 million shares a day 
against 16434 million the week before 
in recent weeks most analysts agree stock and bond traders 
alike have registered their delight over signs of waning 
inflationary pressures but many observers now are questioning how 
long that unanimity of sentiment can continue 
the issue now is just how much will inflation abate and on 
the stock market side just how much will moderating inflation mean 
to profits says greg smith at prudentialbache securities 
i remain somewhat skeptical as to whether the inflation rate 
can keep improving for a year or two accompanied by very good 
profits

in this corner a tag team of leading us 
banks in that corner challenger american telephone amp telegraph 
co the nations largest phone company the purse for this match 
is the plastic in your wallet 
one of the biggest business brawls of 1990 shaped up this past 
week when four major issuers of credit cards challenged atampts new 
card which has attracted enormous consumer interest and could 
realign the dominant players in the us market of roughly 200 
million cards 
citicorp chase manhattan corp bankamerica corp and mnc 
financial corp asked regulators to examine whether atampt was 
flouting banking and communication laws with the universal card a 
nofee lowinterest visa or mastercard that doubles as a telephone 
calling card atampt started issuing them two months ago 
the banks complained the phone giant offered card users 
longdistance call discounts without the needed regulatory 
approval issued the cards through a tiny inadequately financed 
georgia bank and illegally controlled the bank atampt called the 
complaints groundless 
we feel we did our homework and anticipated what the possible 
questions would be said atampt senior vice president peter 
gallagher were in this business to stay 
credit card industry analysts awed by atampts immense marketing 
power prior experience with government regulators and instant 
customer base of 40 million longdistance callers seemed inclined 
to take atampt at its word they said the banks have a real fight on 
their hands 
its like trying to stop a thousandpound gorilla said 
spencer nilson publisher of the nilson report in santa monica 
calif which tracks the credit card business i dont see any 
way you can stop these people if i were american express or 
citibank i would worry 
citicorps citibank subsidiary the largest us issuer of visa 
and mastercards with nearly 37 million said it wasnt upset about 
the competitive implications of atampts entry into an industry known 
for fierce rivalries citibank said it was concerned atampt was 
getting into the game by cheating 
still its no secret that the banks have viewed atampts entry 
into their territory with growing anxiety soon after the phone 
company started issuing the universal card citicorp gave 30 
million in business to atampt competitor mci communications corp 
american express which has issued more than 24 million cards in 
the united states alone has raised no objections to atampts card 
and isnt worried about it said gary tobin vice president of 
public affairs for the companys travel related services division 
he said the basic reason is that american express cards are 
charge cards which must be paid in full each month and therefore 
appeal to a different market than users of a visa or mastercard 
who pay interest on the outstanding balance of what they owe 
atampt had a choice issuing a credit card or charge card they 
went with a credit card said tobin with citibank and chase 
suing them you can see who thinks atampt is their competitor 
atampt has declined to divulge how many people have signed up for 
its new card although the company has said inquiries have vastly 
exceeded expectations industry analysts estimate atampt has issued 
more than a quartermillion since the march 26 debut

fear of taxes is rising and with plenty of 
reason 
the tax foundation states that each americans share of the 
federal debt will increase by 827 in fiscal year 1991 and doesnt 
everyone know that debts eventually have to be paid or somehow 
worked off 
take your eye off taxes and they rise 
some folks still cant fathom how it was that the 1980s began 
with a highly publicized tax cut but that the decade ended with 
both federal and state taxes having risen more than inflation 
locally municipalities have been performing tricks too holding 
the line on basic real estate rates and assessments but managing 
to generate more revenue by adding separate fees for sewers and 
water and trash collections 
now the fear quotient has taken a spurt with indications that 
president bush the great defender against higher taxes might be 
willing to compromise on the issue in order to beat down the budget 
deficit 
the matter of taxes thus seems to be filling a void in a dull 
economy one that is neither strong nor weak neither inflated nor 
deflated no economic boom is in sight and no dangerous recession 
either only boring sluggishness 
taxes appear to be the only major problem with any life in 
it said economist william c dunkelberg in releasing the latest 
quarterly economic report of the national federation of independent 
business 
taxes he said were named as the no 1 problem in the survey 
which included responses from 2377 companies all members of the 
federation it claims a total of more than 500000 mostly small 
companies 
second on the list of important problems was the first cousin of 
taxes regulation which dunkelberg describes as another form of 
taxation that confiscates entrepreneurial resources to the 
governments chosen issues 
the socalled alarmist issues that used to figure prominently in 
the survey tight money rising labor costs and deteriorating 
labor quality all faded in april he said 
in all smallbusiness optimism a statistical measure the 
federation uses to determine the mood of smaller businesses was 
almost unchanged suggesting a continuation of sluggish economic 
activity for the next six months 
if that sounds like an old story it is probably because you 
heard it last year and in 1988 and in 1987 in all four years the 
early spring outlook for business conditions six months ahead was 
about the same 
said dunkelberg if you want to have an economic boom you have 
to experience a bust first but neither bust nor boom is in sight 
instead he said what you can count on is a few more boring 
chapters of modest economic entertainment before we can even begin 
to hope for something more interesting 
economically speaking however boredom cant long exist without 
challenge and increasingly the challenge appears to be shaping up 
over taxes 
the budget deficit points to taxes as a possible remedy 
business has raised taxes to the status of a no 1 problem 
president bush while still not moving his lips has been perceived 
to nod in that direction

united auto workers executives who bragged about 
winning job protection the last time they signed big three 
contracts may have some explaining to do when they meet fellow 
unionists in kansas city this week 
employment security is expected to be the top concern among uaw 
delegates who have watched helplessly in recent years as us 
automakers have closed plants and idled thousands because of too 
many cars and too few buyers despite the reassuring language on 
jobs in the current labor agreements 
the nations leading industrial union begins a convention monday 
to decide the most important issues at contract talks with general 
motors corp chrysler corp and ford motor co starting this 
summer 
besides the job security issue rising health care costs are 
also expected to dominate the convention agenda wages while 
certainly important to the rank and file are lower on the priority 
list 
all three big three contracts covering about 500000 active and 
laidoff workers expire at midnight sept 14 
the differences among the three companies are great but theyre 
all dogged by sluggish sales and aggressive competition from japan 
which has increasingly muscled into the us market by building 
assembly plants here about 28 percent of all cars sold in this 
country are now japanese 
to uaw delegates however the issue of national origin of cars 
is almost secondary many are questioning the usefulness of the job 
protection provisions the union trumpeted years ago in the last big 
three negotiations 
the contract language said an automaker could not shut down an 
assembly plant for any reason other than a slump in sales of the 
product made at that plant 
by the time those contracts expire 17000 workers will have 
been idled by closings at gm assembly plants in leeds mo 
pontiac mich framingham mass and atlanta and at chrysler 
factories in kenosha wis detroit and st louis 
ford has not been under the same pressure as gm and chrysler to 
shrink partly because it did not aggressively build new plants in 
the 1980s the last time it closed an assembly plant in san jose 
calif was in 1983 
in many respects there is only one issue and that is how many 
people will be working at general motors over the long term said 
auto analyst joseph phillippi of shearson lehman hutton inc of new 
york 
at the end of last year there were about 429200 gm hourly and 
salaried employees north america down 9 percent from two years 
earlier fords employment of 205900 was down 23 percent and 
chryslers work force of 88542 dropped 62 percent during the same 
period 
as the active employment rolls shrink the number of retirees 
grows the uaw said it was unable to estimate how many retirees are 
among the big three workers it represents chrysler has about one 
retiree for every active employee activetoretired employee 
ratios at gm and ford are slightly lower 
workers at honda motor cos us assembly plants average 33 
years old compared with the average of 45 at ford because there 
are fewer retirees the japanese enjoy a competitive cost advantage 
over gm ford and chrysler which have growing pension liabilities 
the japanese companies also can price their cars lower because 
of lower labor expenses 
a movement gaining strength in the uaw would add costofliving 
protection for retirees union and management executives have said 
that could be extremely expensive 
the union has no obligation to bargain for retiree benefits but 
to ignore the issue could be political disaster for uaw leaders 
union president owen bieber has said the union looks after its own 
a hot debate in kansas city on cost of living for retirees is 
likely but the issue appears doomed during a conference of the 
uaws skilled trades council in detroit last month a proposal to 
include the issue in bargaining agendas was defeated 
linked to retiree costs are health costs in general automakers 
have said the expenses add hundreds of dollars to the price of each 
car and truck made 
the big three have been meeting during the past six months to 
discuss common concerns about rising healthcare costs and how to 
approach the uaw about them an internal chrysler document 
suggested any changes in job security provisions should be 
accompanied by moves to cut healthcare costs 
its the first time in 11 years that contracts expire at the 
same time in the past the uaw has picked one automaker and 
suspended negotiations with the others when a pact was reached 
with the target it would be forced on the other two with 
modifications 
chrysler negotiated separately with the uaw in the 1980s as it 
recovered from near bankruptcy with the help of federal loan 
guarantees 
with negotiations drawing near automakers are planning 
production increases at the same time the union is telling 
members to save money and avoid big debts both are hedges against 
a potential strike 
those are normal precautions during contract negotiation years 
phillippi thinks the posturing may be unnecessary 
the embedded costs of this industry the infrastructure have 
gotten so high because of robots and ongoing projects which cannot 
stop because of competition with our friends from japan he said 
this industry literally cant afford to take a strike longer than 
a week or two to vent some steam

signals from south africa are confounding the platinum market 
which relies on the racially divided nation for more than 
threefourths of its supply 
an annual report released last week by the british platinum 
refiner johnson matthey plc says south african mining companies 
plan to increase platinum production by nearly 40 percent as of 
1995 
that forecast ordinarily would have given the platinum market a 
reason to retreat but in the case of racially divided south 
africa precious metals strategists always look at how politics 
could affect the market 
so instead of reacting to the johnson matthey report platinum 
futures traders focused last week on incidents of racial violence 
in south africa and the related threat of mining shutdowns 
reports of at least 12 deaths due to racial violence helped 
boost the price of platinum for july delivery on the new york 
mercantile exchange to 507 a troy ounce at the close of trading 
friday compared with 48390 a week earlier 
what really shook the platinum market was news that one of the 
biggest mining companies operating in south africa the 
angloamerican corp shut down part of a gold mine following a 
clash that left two whites dead and several blacks injured 
if the situation in south africa were to reach dangerous 
levels where they would have to close a few of those platinum 
mines you could see a strong rally develop said peter cardillo 
commodity trading adviser with josephthal amp co in new york 
johnson mattheys new annual report on the platinum industry 
makes little mention of racial strife in south africa or the 
possibility of mining disruptions 
the londonbased company said south african mines plan to raise 
production by 1 million troy ounces during the next five years 
this year alone south africa will produce as much as 150000 
ounces more than last years record output of nearly 26 million 
ounces the company predicted 
johnson matthey said worldwide platinum production last year 
reached a new peak of about 34 million ounces falling short of 
demand by 90000 ounces that made 1989 the fifth straight year of 
declining platinum stockpiles 
demand was down 5 percent in 1989 compared with 1988 but last 
year still was the secondhighest demand year on record the report 
said 
demand by the automobile industry which uses platinum in 
catalytic converters rose 9 percent to 145 million ounces 
johnson matthey reported 
the company said jewelryrelated demand climbed to 13 million 
ounces from 12 million in 1988 with almost all of that demand 
coming from japan 
investment demand for platinum bars and coins tumbled 75 percent 
to 160000 ounces last year from 660000 ounces in 1988 mainly 
because of high returns on other investments and a reduction in 
inflation fears johnson matthey said precious metals are 
perceived as a good investment in inflationary times 
despite the forecast for increased production the company said 
it expects continued strong demand from the automotive and jewelry 
sectors to keep the market in a delicate balance 
as far as price is concerned johnson matthey sees no reason 
to deviate from the range forecast in their last interim review in 
november of 1989 which predicted that prices would fluctuate 
between 470 and 520 per ounce the report said
